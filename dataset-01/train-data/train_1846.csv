1,"Here today, gone tomorrow...","I went looking for an adjustable grip exerciser at the local sports store today and found this one. It looked like a good deal. However, when I removed it from the package I was dismayed to find the the rubber block stretched-out on the first rep and subsequent reps did not have the same resistance. Same thing on the other two included rubber blocks. I'll be returning it to the local store tomorrow."
1,Look Elsewhere Go Altus,"Purchased several of them these last few Years. The Rubber Resistance Piece Slides Off, it wears out and Cracks in the Corners, rendering it unusable, and when I Tie It down with a Plastic Tie, it does not extend fully. All of them crack in the corners of the Resistance Blocks on Top, there are NO replacement blocks available..It is good for a few months then throw it away...The Altus is Far Better, Simple to adjust the Tension with one spring in a few seconds, smaller, nothing to wear out...This Harbinger is avery very poor product...."
3,I'm glad I read it.,"I'm honestly not sure what all the fuss is over Candide. It was funny and a lot easier to read than I expected, but... meh."
1,delievery,The delievery was horrible. it came to me later than even the ezpected date. I had to wait for no reason. Anyway the book consition was good.
5,A badly needed tonic,"As a collateral descendant of one of the Immortal 600, Captain Harris Kollock Harrison, I am pleased to see this shameful episode of American history documented. Mauriel Phillips Joslyn has performed a very scholarly investigation not only into the treatment of the Immortal 600 but also into the fanatical thinking that was responsible for Federal prisoner policies during the war. Given the increasingly plastic and shallow views of the war being fed by the mainstream media and academia to the public about the war, ""Immortal Captives"" is a badly needed tonic, and, moreover, a reminder that Lincoln's war to preserve the Union by force was no altruistic exercise in human rights."
5,Americas Buchenwald or Concentration camps,"If you want to buy just one book about American POW camps during the Civil War, this would be an excellent one.Using primary sources, the Federal Official Records ( O.R), 60 pages of footnotes and bibliographies, the mountain of evidence is overwhelming.Why did the Union force the Confederate POWs to slowly die from staravation, is found in this book.Why did Lincoln allow the Union to use these 600 Confederate POW officers to be used as HUMAN SHIELDS is also answered.No this book isn't fiction; it is part of Americas shameful past it tries to keep hidden.The truth will always come to the surface.Mauriel Joslyn has done an excellet job with this book."
1,Doesn't work,"I've tried this adhesive several times, on valve cover gaskets, thermostat gaskets, etc. It simply doesn't work. The gasket will fall off as soon as it's handled. Useless."
1,Weak.,This product is nothing like the real Korean red ginseng my wife brings backfrom China. It is so weak I would guess you would have to take a whole bottle foreach dose. Don't bother with this.
4,"Great collectible, terrible phone","Until it literally melted in my attic, it was a nice collectible. Best ring ever... unfortunately, it was a lousy phone. No associated letters on the number keys, volume was way too quiet (and could not be adjusted), and holding it up to one's face left the pylon between the saucer and secondary hull digging into one's cheek. Beautiful idea, but a bit lacking in execution."
4,well priced motorcycle helmet,This helmet is priced right and comfortable. The supplied visor is ok for warm days but I recommend a non-tinted full face shield for the Seattle area.
1,Only good for looks..........,"If it is kept in the hilt, it makes for a decent wall piece. If you pull it out of the hilt, it is not a good thing.My sword has a bent blade, and a bent handle, which was noticable while in the hilt.I would not spend the money on this item."
1,Unhappy from NJ,The Sentry F3300 Firesafe Waterproof file appears to be constructed to meet its fire proof and water proof claims - there is no way for me to know but it seems solid enough. However it also claims to be able to hold legal sized hanging folders but can only handle A4 files at most. These files are 1 to 2 inches narrower than legal sized. I wanted a legal sized file and the low rating is based solely on this misrepresentation. How do I know if the fire and water proof claim is also in error?
1,lid comes off,"i've had this safe for 3 years, and one day, the lid fell off. The hinge broke and this white powdery substance went all over the place. I would think a safe would last more than 3 years."
3,Good while it lasted,"I've had this safe for 5+ years. Not purchased at Amazon. I agree that fundamentally this is more about the fire/water protection than preventing theft (deterrent at best). I open the safe on average once a month. The lid broke off this past week. Life another review, I can see the hinge itself is made of some rubbery material filled with white powdery substance. So now the lid can be opened from behind! ... Going back to the observation that the locking mechanism isn't really going to keep anyone out, I guess I'm not that panicked about it."
4,Sam Choy's Polynesian Kitchen,The book was well written and very informative. It included a whole section on ingriedients indigineous to the islands of the south pacific. The recipes were basically straight forward in their presentation and language and would be easily followed by even the novice cook. I purchased it solely for research on a polynesian event I am involved in and the book was informative.
4,familar but fresh crossover of hardcore/thrash,"these guy mastered a new breed of crossover thrash/hardcore.these guys sound like slayer,ringworm,and cro mags.with a touch of deathmetal but very heavy and fast but not the average band.they have bridged the gap many have tried this is worth every cent check them out they make many new bands sound like garage bands or talentless monkeys"
5,You come into this world with nothing..,"except for yourself. YOU LEAVE THIS WORLD WITH NOTHING EXCEPT FOR YOURSELF! The best,hardest,most brutal album EVER made. Mike Score is a pheonominal song writer and lyricist. Saying ""nothing even comes close"" is an insult. All Out War has re-invented the genre. GET ALL THREE ALBUMS NOW! And prepare to be awoken..."
5,"Subtle, Intelligent, Revealing","Prochnik brings extraordinary skill and insight to this subject. In the process he tells a fascinating story that reveals as much about Freud as it does about the uneasy history of America's intellectual and psychic life. This is a subtle, probing author, erudite and relentlessly curious -- a bracing combination. As a vision of psychoanalysis in the United States it is indispensable. But it also, and startlingly, breaks new ground in our understanding of Freud himself."
3,Necessary backup of the original ones.,These rubber sleeves of the Shure IEMs don't really break down like the other foam ones that are essentially expendable products.However it is still nice to have back ups if the rubber sleeves are your favorite among the many kind of sleeves Shure IEMs uses.
1,USB vaccum Cleaner/Hoover for Laptop PC Keyboard-Black,"This item don't met my expectations,because don't clean well, not a new package is used before, I don't recommend this item."
5,USB Keyboard Vacuum,"Great product, great price. Order fulfillment and shipment as quick as any I've ever experienced."
1,Useless piece of equipment.,"I purchased the USB Vacuum Cleaner/hoover for laptop to clean the dust off of my keyboards. When I received the unit and plugged it in, I could hear it run, but absolutly could not feel any vacuum whatsoever. I pressed the turbo mode and the noise got louder but there was no discernable suction. I held it down to a small piece of fuzz that was lying on my surface area and if I touched the fuzz, it would pick it up and stick it onto the brush. This thing is absolutly useless; it does nothing. It is beyond me how anyone could put something like this on the market; don't they ever try out things before they sell them?Any how, Amazon refunded my money and never got back to me about returning the unit. It is still sitting here on my computer stand waiting for someone to tell me if they want it returned or not."
3,very average,"when i purchase a new item i do not expect it to be mailed in a ziplock bag inside a brown envelope. i suspect its a second-hand, not a new product. No proper packing, no instructions..."
1,Don't recommended.,"It does not clean anything. Stick to the air duster cans instead. The company was nice to replaced it, but the second works the same as the first one."
1,"Keyboard vacuum? Just a mini fan. That's all! Seriously, who sells this kind of gadget and feels ok about themself?!!!","I purchased this to help keep my keyboard dust, lint and crumb free. What a joke this is!!! It is just a mini fan. It has NO sucking power what so ever and the person who invented it, knew it and the person who sold it to me, knew it! Shame on you both! That is what makes our freedoms in this country a bad thing, not good! Try selling something you can be proud of!"
4,Its nice,"Just enough power to suck up hair and dust, but don't expect anything more. Used it as a gift and got praise for it."
2,it works all fine but its vacuum power is toooo weak...,delivered in time... works all fine but it is tooooo weak at vacuum cleaning... i won't buy it again as i does not serve the purpose.
2,Poor Performance,"This Vacuum easily plugs into any USB port and once you turn it on the motor sounds strong, but it's not. This vacuum can only pick up minute pieces of dust. It has very little suction at all. It could not even pick up a few very tiny pieces of bread crumbs. There are better battery and rechargeable vacuums out there."
2,"It doesn't suck, therefore it sucks.","The item was delivered in good condition, so no complaints there.Also, when plugged in an turned on, it did make some noises that conjured up the image of a tiny, not-working model of a vacuum-cleaner.So what am I complaining about? I guess I was hoping to receive a device that actually DOES catch some of the breadcrumbs and nasty fingernail tips lodged between my keys. Even a sucked up mote would have lifted my spirits - but alas! No such thing happened, and when I tried to turn it off, the switch broke.So there's $11,90 I'll never see again (if you include shipping, that is). At least I can scare my cat with it..."
1,"Great Idea, VERY BAD product","I got this as a stocking stuffer. I thought it was an awsome idea. How do you get in the little nooks and cranies of the keybord? And what better idea than power it with your own computer? No batteries, no power outlets... brilliant. NOT SO.This product is useless. First of all, the attachments do not stay put. As soon as you try to use it, it falls appart. And the vacuum power... what vacuum? None whatsoever.Do yourselves a favor and avoid this product!! It looks cute and it is cheap. It is also useless."
2,Fun but Unwise,"I tried hooking this vacuum cleaner up to the USB hub that I ordered at the same time. It would not even start, which says more about the hub than the vacuum cleaner. Pushing the ""turbo"" button caused all the pretty lights on my USB hub to go out so long as I kept my finger on the button. I decided not to gimmick the USB hub with extra power to try and fix the problem.After hooking the vacuum cleaner up to my netbook it worked fine, including the high speed button. Later I attached it to a monitor usb port at work and it was noticeably underpowered. Pushing the ""turbo"" button caused my monitor to stop working completely. Fortunately power cycling the monitor fixed that problem.For all the laughter and fun I have had with this preposterous device, I strongly recommend not attaching it to any electronic device for which you have feelings."
1,It's the pits!,"This product was broken when I got it and it has a good suction on it, but it doesn't work as well as the canned pressured air to clean a keyboard."
1,waist of time,this product is truly waist of time 2 look at. you would do better with damp cloth 2 clean your computer. i quess you get what you pay for. i dont like the ideal they said its the vacuum cleaner/hoover for computers.do hoover know the using their name.
3,sounds of peace,I buy music to use in my massage practice. This just didn't do much for me. I found it irritating and not near soothing enough.
4,This movie is really surprising!,"Nightfall starts out as light-hearted little film between a bunch of friends, just goofing off at a Memorial Day party. Without spoiling it for you, by the end of the film, well, they're not all together anymore.....something happens to pretty much the whole world. Don't miss the earthquake scene and the funny yet tragic scene with the crazy Confederate guy with the gun!!! This is a really enjoyable film debut."
5,Suspenseful and very fun!,"Nightfall fits into that small category of films that truly does surprise the viewer. It starts out looking like it's going down a fairly well-trodden path of the typical ""monster-type movie"" but where it takes you instead is nothing short of amazing. It is at once suspenseful and frightening, but carries real heart through the entire journey. I found myself actually leaning into the screen, worried about these characters and scared about what was happening to the world around them. The effects are realistic and scary (I got chills every time there was ""electrical interference""...watch the movie and you'll KNOW what I mean) and the ending is both poignant and jaw-dropping. Nightfall is very, very entertaining and I'm glad I took a chance and bought it rather than just renting it....it's definitely one I'll be watching again! Though, maybe next time I'll leave the lights on......."
3,"Interesting, But Not Very Horrorific","Interesting collection of writers, some famous and some unknowns, but all in all not a real page turner. Some stories I couldn't even finish I got so bored. Some were so good I got goose pimples. Go figure."
4,"Sonny's ""Movin' Out,"" You Should Move In","Sonny Rollins' ""Movin' Out"" is a classic set of hard bop from the mid-50s. Four of the albums songs feature the personnel of Kenny Dorham, Elmo Hope, Percy Heath and Art Blakey joining Sonny, while on one track, the lenghty ballad ""More Than You Know,"" the band consists of Sonny, Monk, Tommy Potter and Art Taylor. The standout tune on this recording is ""Solid,"" one of Sonny's most covered compositions, and this is the definitive version. But the other songs are no slouches -- the title track and ""Swinging for Bumsy"" are hard driving, straight ahead boppers, while the high point on the mid-tempo ""Silk N' Satin"" is a glorious, distant echo-like trumpet line from Dorham. ""Movin' Out"" doesn't net a fifth star in my opinion because this is very short CD, only around 30 minutes. But the music is excellent, so ""Movin' Out"" may be short, but it is definitely sweet."
5,Captive Care for the Rehab of Insectivorous Bats,"Not only an outstanding piece of reference material but an absolute must for any individual responsible for the rehab of bats. I have had 2 veterinarians as well as my orthopedic surgeon (a bat enthusiast) review the book and all have given it raves. As another book reviewer has mentioned, it is unofficially called the 'bat bible' within the bat community. Congratulations to Lollar and French for their original work as well as this new, updated version of the bat bible."
3,Too expensive...,"A little too expensive for the information included. Most of the detailed descriptions and advice can be found online for free from bat scientists. This book is great if you are wanting to gain a little bit more knowledge about bats. However, if you want to expand your knowledge considerably, there are some other books that are more appropriate."
4,Great Sound!,"I hadn't heard Contzen yet, which is why I picked this CD up. I'm glad I did, it is beautiful. The sound she's able to produce is rich and soothing and her playing is very precise. The Bach pieces are the best! I don't usually listen to solo violin - usually I listen to concertos, etc. but Contzen has really opened my ears to a great solo violin sound. I gave this cd only 4 stars because I don't particularly like all the pieces on the cd but she plays them all beautifully."
5,Hanging Out,"Bought these to bring some order to my garage. Have sleeping bags, a bike, a large pet carrier and various other objects now hang from these in my garage, bringing order to the room and comfort to my mind."
4,CD Review,"I bought this CD for one song, ""Kay"", but am pleasantly surprised by the entire song list. He does some very good covers of some other classic country songs. Too bad he does not have a recording contract right now."
5,Get this SNDTrack and GO SEE THE MOVIE!,"After just having spent 4 months in Nice, France on study abroad, my sentiments for this type of movie are quite strong. this was an excellent movie that just made me want to turn around and go spend more time abroad. This soundtrack is wonderful, and if you listen to it after watching the movie, it can evoke the same feelings in you because the music was chosen to match the scenes very well. It ranges from mellow background music, pefect for the background of a nice dinner, to GREAT salsa and cumbia music that you will be unable to keep your feet from tapping and head nodding to. I highly recommend this CD."
4,response to someone's question,"someone asked about the techno song that was played after they all walked out of the club, it's called aerodynamic and it's by daft punk.... anyway this was a great movie and the soundtrack was incredible, i especially liked the spanish stuff like Cambia La Vida"
3,Bon film,"Great soundtrack. The story reminds me of my younger days spent in Europe. Young people will like it, and older people will wax nostalgic."
5,Awesome Soundtrack,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, as it inspired me to live and travel overseas for 5 years of my young life. The soundtrack is mostly latin/spanish songs, and if you watch the movie you will see why I think it is so good as it sets the mood and scenery and feeling of the movie very well at appropriate times."
5,buy it.,"seen the movie? buy the album. This soundtrack completely captures the feel of the film, ranging from sweet Spanish flamenco to the clubs of barcelona, with classics like ""que viva la noche."" The songs are all good and fit well together. A must have."
1,Question,"I'm going to see the film this afternoon and I was wondering if anybody knew the name of the song that featured in the trailer after Wendy asks ""Do you like riding horses?""?"
3,Not for small ankles,"I lost myNathan Timing Chip Anklebandso I saw this one in a local Tri store. It's probably meant for larger people. I'm pretty skinny and my L ankle measures 19.5cm. The smallest that this band will go is a 22.5cm. So if you have small ankles, steer clear of this band and get the Nathan"
5,Bringing Our Spirits to Work,"Judith Anderson provides a roadmap to a workplace which welcomes the Spirits of its employees. Of course greater productivity is achieved when workers are invited to share their creativity, grow personally and really put their ""heart"" into their work. By sharing personal stories with warmth and humor, Anderson sets an example of how honesty and a willingness to learn transforms relationships, leading to greater job satisfaction, reduction of ego struggles and power plays, enabling everyone to ""fly"" professionally."
3,A Quick Overview of Religion,"Though this book is called an Atlas, and uses the continents for organization and division, this is really a survey book - an overview of religions in the world. What is positive about this book is the breadth of religious issues and movements that are covered from all around the world. The drawback is that many of these overviews are short - taking up a page plus illustrations. And some of the information presented has small mistakes. But overall it is a decent overview for anyone looking to go beyond the local religious information, or wishes to see the breadth of religious practices in the world. However, know the visits are only skin deep - if you want to know more there are more substantial books there to introduce you to major religious movements. A decent way to dip your toe into the breadth of religious beliefs."
3,dont know,book ok not so great romance book came wood buy from them again. book in great shape packaged ok came in mail good price
4,needs more details,this book is a very good read but it needs to go into a lot more detailes when it comes to the sex. but if you can get your hands on it a know that you will enjoy it. i know i did.
1,Lock stopped working,"I bought this a few months ago but haven't had the chance to use it until now so it sat in my office not being touched for a few months.Today is the day that I finally needed to use it and the keys were still in the lock so I go to press the button and it doesnt open. So I take the keys out and put it back in, turn it a few times... still nothing. Maybe I am not pressing the button hard enough! So I try until my fingers hurt then got a hammer to push against the button... No luck. So I get a screw driver and use the hammer and start pounding my way in... few minutes later the front part of the lock busted off and I saw the hook that stopped working, unlatched it and opened it up.One thing I learned a while ago, if you're going to invest in something, do it the right way and buy something with quality. I have had to learn this lesson too many times and unfortunately it is still trying to stick in my head."
1,hinges on this unit is a problem,my hinge broke off also after 3 years. White powdered dust covered with a plastic tube hinge.
1,"Don't buy it if you are intended to protect disks, CDs, tapes and Videos.","I have just purchased this chest. The first thing I read from the packing box was this product is not intended to protect computer disks, CDs, tapes, videos. This was not mentioned at all in product description on 3 to 4 website that I checked before I decided to buy it. I was more than disappointed. I feel that the seller was evasive..."
1,Hate this thing,"For me, this safe is nearly impossible to open. I usually have to ask someone to open it for me. To be able to push down hard on the top, and at the same time pull up on the latch, is completely impossible. I regret that I bought it and do not recommend this product. In addition to that, the inside space is limited and not much fits into it. It's heavy and a lot of safe for what it appears to hold -- very deceptive and not very functional."
2,"Very HEAVY, with very SMALL compartment inside!","Looks are truly deceiving. This security chest's inside storage area looks a LOT bigger on the box picture than it actually is! The unit is also way too heavy, with very thick walls, thus not allowing for much inside storage area at all. Surely, there must be a cost-effective fire-resistant material 'Sentry' could use here that is not nearly as thick and heavy as this one. The lock mechanism is also very cheap and flimsy. Had to return this item."
4,It Serves It's Purpose (I Hope),"I'm pretty satisfied with the product and now I have a 'peace' of mind. Of course, I purchased it to protect my valuable info and dinero in case of fire. So far it's easy to handle and lift-able (I do workout, so that may explain that). I got a great deal on the safe and at this point couldn't ask for more. Hope this review helps."
1,"faulty lock, bad product","We received this as a gift. From the first day the lock did not work properly, we had to jiggle the key quite a bit to open the lid, we thought it a minor inconvenience and since it was a gift did not want to ask for a receipt, big mistake. Not sure how the lock works but it continued to get worse and worse. Finally the frustration got the best of me and I took a crowbar to it, which did the job surprisingly quick, so fire proof, maybe but definately not a place to protect your valuables from theft."
1,NO stars.,Useless. Completely useless. Safe latches/locking mechanism never worked corrected and has always either been unable to seal OR stuck closed and unable to access anything inside! Annoying waste.
3,Fire-safe chest,"It is a lot heavier than i expected, but it fits it purpose. Also a little smaller than i expected but it is sufficient for storing important documents/items which is why we bought it. Overall it is a good purchase."
2,Expecting more,"After learning that Nick Bantock had written more books after Griffen and Sabine, I was eager to try them all . ""The Forgetting Room' sounded like a good bet. But the very small print, the less than top quality production, and the story itself, in my opinion, make it third rate. I will carefully consider the reviews before trying another."
2,Forgettable,"At his best, Bantock's work carries a visual and narrative sense of the unseen, of mysterious forces guiding the visible characters. Those stories feature evocative artwork, in complex and layered imagery, often in ways that invite (or demand) direct involvement of the reader.Unfortunately, as in this case, the narrative mystery sometimes just turns to murk. Likewise, some of the artwork, including one image that seems central to the plot, becomes so dense and dark that it becomes nearly illegible. Given so many visual elements with most in such fragmentary condition, I found a paradox of too much and not enough information for its meaning to come clear. Not all of the book's art suffered that fate, though, and I wish that more of the book had been in the art and less in the text.I'll keep coming back to Bantock's work, because I liked his earlier work so much. I found this disappointing, however.-- wiredweird"
2,A better tale of Bantock himself than a mere work of fiction,"I love Nick Bantock's work, and have for a few years now. I consider his works an inspiration for my own and I enjoyed this book as a means to discover how Bantock as an artist creates his pieces. As a story however, I felt it lacked the passion it set out to portray and seemed hurredly written.All Bantock collectors will buy this book, and most will treasure it, not for the forgetful story, but for the artwork and an insight into the artist himself.If you are looking for a great story however, I'm sad to say you should look elsewhere.Don't worry, I'll still be first in line to buy the next one."
5,"""Forgetting Room"" by Nick Bantock","This book is like a breath of fresh air!!! It has a magic in a very heart felt story and its intriguing surrealistic symbolism. Aesthetically it is quite outstanding and made even more so in the intimate format of the book. I am now very eager to visit the small Spanish town of Ronda! I am sorry that it has taken me so long to discover the books of Nick Bantock, which I might add I am now collecting. As an artist I particularly identify with the author's work and have purchased additional copies of ""The Forgetting Room"" to share with others. The perfect word to discribe this book is that it is a treasure in its total sum of aesthetic worth and the revelation of the story!"
4,Bantock Junkies Get A Gift,"This latest of Nick Bantock's novels didn't have the exotic feel of the Griffin & Sabine Trilogy or The Venetians Wife but was just as well written and, of course, illustrated. The story was a lovely tale of self discovery, more introspective than his other works, but still thought provoking. Yet another masterpiece from my favorite author."
5,"Mysteries, puzzles and exquisite artwork","This book is a treasure - a good short story, beautiful binding and art reproduction and wonderful folkloric fantasy all in one package. It won't take you long to read it and (despite the title) you'll never forget it."
2,Poor picture quality (with coax),"With the coaxial hookup (standard cable) or composite video hookup the picture quality is very, very poor. Blurry and shimmery. I tried it with a number of different input sources and the results were unacceptable.However, with the s-video hookup, the picture is solid.Might be an OK TV if you only need s-video."
4,this tv is good,"i don't know why this tv got a bad rating. the picture quality is amazing even when using the coaxial cables. the sound is mediocre, but plugging in comuter speakers fixes the problem.my suggestion for the people complaining about picture quality is to buy a hd tuner for $200 (but cheaper on ebay) to get true over the air hdtv."
2,Tv was ok if it still worked!,We purchased this TV the day after thanksgiving 2005 and it was a Christmas present so it was not even taken out of the box until 12/25/05. We put this in our bedroom so it has not been used much - maybe 12 hours in the past year. The other day when we turnedit on the picture was there for about 2 seconds then slid down the screen untill it was gone and all you could see was vertical lines - if yo uchange the channell the picture would come back for 2 seconds and do the same thing. I spent a lot of time holding for CS with polaroid and received nothing! Unfortunately we were just outside of the 1 year warranty but I thought maybe they woul dmake an exception since it was so close and pretty obvious that it was a xmas present because of the time of year but NO Luck! We are now going to take it to a local repair store and pay $45 to see if it can be fixed reasonbly. I am very dissappointed. I do think the at the TV was alright for what we used it for when it did work.
4,Classy and Tasty,"Buy it for their performance of Ill Wind. Classic. Also, Dave McKenna handles the piano duties. Nuff said!"
5,Required reading from many top breeders,"We've been researching breeders in the U.S. (California to Massachusetts), Canada and Australia for 2 years.Let me tell you ... this book is REQUIRED reading for many of the top breeders.Seemingly basic information such as ""what type of food"" is short-term information. DeeDee knows that the list of top quality dog foods changes every year. Food choice can also be a pedigree/line decision and is often in a puppy contract. Such basic information should be assessable from your quality breeder."
5,Excellent !,"For someone that had never heard or seen a Mastiff before this is the best book. We lost one of our most loved house companions (Rottweiler) and we unexpectingly came across this breed and fell in love with it. So in reading as much about the breed as I possibly could find I came across this book, bought it and loved it. We now have our first Mastiff and love her. I will certainly recommend this book to anyone. Thank you Dee Dee"
1,Do not buy,Worthless book. I was fooled into paying $40 for this out of print book because of everyone's claim that this is a required reading by all top breeders. It's worthless information for any practical new owner. Filled with endless quotes from history books and no practical info about owning and caring for a mastiff. Some info about showing and breeding if you want to do that. Very hard to know who the audience of this book are. With the price of this book you can buy 3 or 4 other modern more relative books.
5,"She truly is a lover of the breed ,The book is great !!",This book should be on every new Mastiff owners Book shelf . It is very informative from where the Mastiff came .And how we have come to love this breed today .Its realy and truly a great book on the breed
2,I found this book derivative and overly focused on MCOA.,"The author includes a surfeit of anecdotal stories, and many readers will find these enjoyable, but for an unbiased description of mastiffs and dogbreeding, this book sorely lacks. The author perpetuates the myth that breeders of pedigreed, showring dogs are doing individual dog breeds a favor. I also found it offensive to pay for a book so laden with promotional activity."
1,Mastiff Aristocratic Guardian by DeeDee Andersson,"I found this book a complete waist of time, I found it had too much filler information. I had purchased this book after reading the above reviews, but I was extremely disappointed. I paid full price for this book and understand why the price has dropped. Very good book are: Mastiff by Kim Campbell Thornton and The Mastiff, An Owners guide to a happy healthy Pet by John M. Becknell. With the above two books you will not be disappointed in your selection of either one. Feeding a OEM puppy is very important, and Ms. Andersson ""would never presume to tell an owner what to feed their puppy"". Well guess what, I purchased this book to find out what to feed by puppy. Good luck"
5,A book shocked full of breed specific information,"This book is a must for all owners/breeders/or those thinking about owning a Mastiff. The Aristocratic Mastiff has met the author's goal letting us know why the Mastiff is the greatest animal on earth. You will find heartwarming stories as well as important information on the breeding, caring, and loving these animals."
4,Good Product,The product works very well and is easy to hook up and use. I would recommend it to anyone who has video surveillance needs in their home.
5,Sine Qua Non for Homeric Studies,"We are forever in Richard J. Cunliffe's debt: he has provided us with a lexicon that gives immense assistance to those of us who study Homeric poetry. As some have already noted, Cunliffe's work is thorough and indispensable for engaging in the reading of Homer. The entries for Greek verbs contain the place where one can find instances of the word in the Homeric literature as well as the participial or infinitival forms of the Greek verbs. I have been completely satisfied with this Greek lexicon. The binding for my copy is also satisfactory."
4,What fun !!!,"I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this book ! I loved the setting of Greenwich Village and the Village Blend Coffee House. The characters are much better developed than many ""cozy"" mysteries and the whole murder mystery much more believable than the usual. The coffee house actually plays a role in the mystery versus being just a setting where the character runs in and out of on the way to other places. It works really well as a backdrop to the action of the book. Being a lover of coffee, I found the coffee references fun as well as educational ... I wouldn't change that a bit (unlike other reviewers). I have read all three of the books in the series in the past couple of weeks and am eagerly awaiting book number four !"
4,Easy read,"This was a good, short read. I think I finished it in a matter of days. This was my first book in this series, and I'm looking forward to reading the others."
3,Others can tell you about the story. Let me tell you what I liked about this,What I enjoyed most about this was the information on coffee and brewing. The mystery was a sideline.
2,Terribly Boring,"This book was not worth my time. Not only was it boring, but the authors (a husband and wife team) found a way to interject a recipe for the ""perfect cup"" much too often. The characters were trite and underdeveloped. And, you will know who the killer is as soon as you meet the character."
2,good heroine; 2 1/2 stars,"This is an average read; somewhat enjoyable and breezy. The main character is written well but I don't think that the mystery was fleshed out.Without going into specifics, the big revelation at the end seemed obvious. Also, the love triangle that is being developed is not one bit interesting. I doubt I will read any other books in this series."
3,At least I know what those people are ordering,at those coffeehouses - would have enjoyed this book more if the author or editor or proofreader knew the differing between balling and bawling.
5,Thoroughly enjoyed,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had a hard time putting it down!!! I like reading books in order and I'm glad that I won't have to wait till the next installment since there is quite a few already out. I am already on number 2 and enjoying it as well'
1,Worse than weak coffee,"What's worse than weak coffee? A weak plot and a weak main female character. I can't stand this main character who allows her philandering ex-husband to stay in her apartment. This woman is a 'victim' of her ex-mother-in-law's attempts to get the couple back together. While apparently upset that she 'has' to let her ex-husband stay with her, she is flirting with a married detective. Ugh. Add a pretentious attitude toward coffee-making and you have a thoroughly distasteful character.So is that the worst of it? No. The story is interrupted several times by instructions on making the so-called perfect cup of coffee. Is this supposed to be a coffee cookbook or a mystery? Including the recipes at the back of the book is one thing, but in the middle of the story?This story seems so poorly written I can't see how it ever made it to the publisher. Maybe it was self-published--that would explain a lot.Just like with bad $5 coffee, it doesn't live up to the hype. No more for me, thanks."
4,promising start to a mystery series,"I really enjoyed this cozy mystery, first in a series.Clare Cosi has been hired by her former mother-in-law to manage a historic coffeehouse in Greeenwich Village. She did a great job when she managed the place before divorcing the owner's son and moving to New Jersey.But now that her daughter Joy is grown and enrolled in a cooking school in NYC, Clare is willing to come back to the business.On her very first official day, she comes in to find one of the employees dead in the shop. It looks like an accident, but there is the possibility of foul play.Before she knows it, Clare is embroiled in investigating a possible murder, as well as meeting two possible love interests - one her sexy badboy ex, another a NYC homicide detective.I really like the Greenwish Village setting, and also really like the well drawn characters. Oddly enough, I have never developed a taste for coffee in real life. I am a tea drinker."
2,Boring,"I like some other culinary mysteries, so I gave this a try. It was just OK. I made it all the way through the book, but I wouldn't read any of the others in the series, even though I already bought the next one before I started this one. As others mentioned, she talks too much about how to make different kinds of coffee. She also has a habit of insulting vegetarians and people who drink caffeine free coffee (I am both). The other thing that didn't appeal to me is the romance parts with her ex-husband, since he is described as a jerk and she already divorced him for that reason. It would be better if she dated the detective. Overall the book is slow moving and boring. I would not recommend."
3,Caffeine Overdose,"Nicely written and just an OK story but way too much detail on coffee. There are segments within this novel, where it's just pages on pages of detail about how to properly ground coffee and brew a cup. A bit too much detail to the part where it becomes boring.It's alright, but after reading the first book, I'm not inclined to buy anymore in the series."
2,I only made it to chapter 7...,"I really really tried to finish this book. I made it all the way to chapter 7 before I finally gave up and read the ending and threw the book aside. There is just too much coffee and not enough plot for me. I thought the main character was ok but not really in depth enough to keep me interested. I was looking for another series to get into while waiting on other book releases, however, I will have to keep on looking."
3,"Rather have a cup of tea,,,","Although this series seems to be well written, I'm not into stalkers. Both the first & second book in this series uses stalking & stalkers. ALthough the books were well written I can't do the stalking thing. I'm going back to my Tea Shop murders. No stalkers there."
4,On What Grounds,"If you're a coffee drinker and just can't let go of that cup for anything, then this book is for you. But would you put that cup of coffee down if a murder just took place? Could another murder be developing and it could be you next time,just take another drink of that coffee and read the book to find out just who's next. Larry Hobson-Author-""The Day Of The Rose"""
5,"Review of ""On What Grounds""","""On What Grounds"" is the first book in the Coffeehouse mystery series featuring female-sleuth Clare Cosi. She is the manager of famed Greenwich Village coffeehouse, The Village Blend. The mystery in this book revolves around Clare finding the body of her young employee, Anabelle, at the bottom of the stairs. The police rule it an accident but Clare believes Anabelle was pushed.There are a lot of interesting things going on in this well-written book, including info on coffee storage, roasting and brewing. I liked it and will be reading more in the series."
1,Worst book I've read in a long time,"If you like endless descriptions of coffee making and unrealistic characthers, this book is for you. There is nothing about this I could relate to or recommend. You barely know anything about the victim, and the parts of the book that aren't going on endlessly about coffee seem to be filled with obscure descriptions of the type of watch or dress someone is wearing. The ""star"" of the book is thrown together with her ex-husband, someone whose company she does NOT seem to enjoy but she puts up with him anyway for some unknown reason."
1,Lacking a story,A lot of scattered waffling and not much of the actual story. I almost deleted it after 2 chapters but was hoping for improvement...sadly it didn't get better and I wish I hadn't wasted my time.
2,average,"stopped halfway though and moved onto something with more substance. i know its supposed to be a 'ight/cozy' mystery but the characters were flat, the dialogue ridiculous and the plot just plain boring.... shouldnt have invested in the second book before giving the first a try. guess ill just donate both to the local library..."
3,Not into coffee,"Not enough plot development and way too much information about fancy coffee. If you are a gourmet coffee fan, this may be the mystery for you. I probably should give the series a second chance, but I won't."
3,Confusing,"I think there is a tad too much coffee-ology in this book. To me, it detracted from the mystery and the story."
2,Too slow,"I know I am in the minority, but I did not care for this book and actually did not finish it. I wasn't crazy about the main character and found the relationship with her ex-husband contrived. I will be moving on to a different cozy mystery series."
1,Couldn't even bring myself to finish it,"This book would have been so good if it weren't for the continous references to coffee. I know its a caffinated-themed mystery but GMAB - every single page talked about how to make the perfect cup or expresso, or the perfect mocha, or the perfect blend - WHATEVER. I just couldn't get through it.If this author wants to find a wider market then it needs to tone down (a lot) on the writer's coffee obsession. Boo hiss!"
4,Coffee and Crime -- What a Combo!,"My wife and I highly recommand this clever mystery. The puzzle will keep you guessing, and the characters are a lot of fun, especially Clare and her ne'er-do-well ex-husband, who's a bit of a rake. The setting is interesting, too, and we found the coffee lore fascinating (Now we don't have to ask our daughter, a barista, what she does at work). Even if you don't love coffee, you'll want to drink a pot of it after reading just a few chapters. And if coffee IS your thing, then add another star!"
4,We readers know how to make espresso the right way now.,I enjoyed this mystery. It was a quick read and the characters were likable. There was a good balance of mystery and romance. I even tolerated all the cute coffee themes with the cat's name and such. The one thing that bothered me was how many times the coffee explanations were repeated. I didn't mind the descriptions of coffee drinks and how they are made the first time but to repeat them every time a drink is made (And they made a lot of them!) was too much. One thing I found amusing was how Claire disliked decaf but drank strong coffee drinks all day and night. She either has an amazing resistance to caffeine or she never sleeps. Cut out a few descriptions of coffee being made and what designer clothes they were wearing and this will be a great series.
2,On What Grounds,The book was an easy read but not as well written as I like. It was fine for a beach read but not really suspensful enough to keep me reading with enthusiasm.
2,Too many wordy descriptions,"I really wanted to like this book but the author spent way too much time on coffee trivia. Also, I was annoyed that every time she mentioned Claire's apartment, it was ""the duplex apartment""; the counter was always ""the blue marble counter"" and the plaque had hung ""for over a hundred years"". You get the point. The characters were not very believable and the plot got bogged down in unnecessary details."
3,Luke Warm,This is a murder mystery that takes place in a coffee house in New York. Clare is the old/new manager of the coffee shop when she finds one of her employees dead. She is determined to find out what happened to her. I found the plot slow and the story dull. It was missing everything I like in a mystery and the coffee recipes were - well just okay. I wouldn't go out of my way to read any more in this series.
3,cozy mysteries and coffee,"I wish that I could give 1/2 stars. The book isn't a four but it's not a three it's in between. It was a fast read but not predictable. I didn't figure it all out till the end when I read it. If you are a coffee drinker, you will like the references and recipes. The story line was decent enough to make me want to read the rest of the series"
2,Coffee - ad nauseum,"Well written with all the obvious plot twists - attractive, fit, buxom, divorcee meets single man - she still has contact with the ex husband with all that entails. The main complaint with this book: every time lead character makes any type of coffee - she goes on and on and on and on and on AND ON about how the coffee should be made. EVERYTIME!!!Can only read the proper way to make coffee so many times - it interferes with the mystery. If not for that would buy rest of series. Recipes are interesting enough to want to make."
2,Does the heroine really solve anything???(possible spoilers),After a painfully slow start.. I suppose this might be expected seeing this was the first of a series.. can only hope the follow up adventures dont suffer from this... our hero essentially accuses every potential suspect of the crime only to have the real crimial basically fall in her lap.. the only real detection skills she seems to possess is reading coffee stains on peoples shirt.. anyway if you like your coffee you can learn something... but if you want a real mystery... look elsewhere...
5,Solved my door closing problems.,My old beams on my Moore 'O Matic door opener began to have a lot of problems and the door would not close properly. These were a snap to install and solved my problem.
1,Didn't work with 3 wire Raynor,"I had a 3 wire Raynor sensor and this sensor was not compatible with it. I had to return the sensor, they did credit me. Amazon should put more technical details in the sales literature to prevent the wasted time & shipping costs"
1,Not Universal!,"I bought these because my chamberlain Lifmaster Professional would no longer work in the direct sunshine. I read the reviews that these were great in direct sun applications and were universal. In the sun they're fine the beams worked great. Universal they are not. They are two wire just like my originals but wile they light up and work they don't communicate with my garage opener. I even tried wiring them both ways.On the issue of sensors working in direct sun, I bought new chamberlain sensors and they work just fine, just like the originals did 7 years ago. If your sensors don't work in direct sun they need to be adjusted or replaced.My biggest complaint about this product is they're universal claim. They need to have specific brands/models that they are truly compatible with."
2,Didn't work for my Genie,"Hard to line up the sensors and when they did line up, the opener didn't work. Switched wires around a few times and still wouldn't communicate. Went to Home Depot and bought a Genie replacement and this lined up quickly and worked."
5,Fixes sunlight interference!,"After 12 years in our house, the sun started preventing our garage door from closing. Nothing I did seemed to help, aside from getting out of the car to cast a shadow on the sensor. I came to Amazon looking for a solution, and thanks to the user comments, found one.These sensors are simple to install, and after two weeks, haven't had one incident where the sun prevented the door from closing. I highly recommend these replacement sensors to anyone who has this same problem."
3,ASPDOORS Customer Service and Products,ASPDOORS sells this Digi Code Model CR2149 Universal opener. The product does not come with wires. These wires are an essential component to a successful installation. The seller ASPDOORS is the most difficult seller when it comes to assisting buyers in successful installation. If you need to make a return be prepared to have it cost you 40% of the original purchase price. Do not purchase this item from ASPDOORS. There are other quality Amazon sellers who deliver this product with everything you need to have a successful experience with the product. And they will not provide inferior product and take money your money that is not rightfully theirs to take like ASPDOORS.
4,Universal CR-2149 - Safety Beam Sensors for Garage for Stanley Door Openers,Order was processed quickly and item arrived as promised. My son installed the units per the included instructions in about 20 minutes.The only thing we needed to do was ensure they were aligned precisely which was somewhat touchy. Having both LED's lighted does not necessarily mean the units are aligned correctly. Perhaps some mention of this on your instructions would be useful for some.
1,"DON""T EXPECT ANY TECH HELP!!!","I purchased these to replace a set of ""yellow"" sensors for a Moore-0-Matic opener...(14 years old)The new ones only have 2 terminals, the old receiver has 4 terminals...There is of course no information in the instructions on how to wire these in this scenario...THERE IS ALSO OF COURSE NO, NONE, FORGET ABOUT IT, customer service or Tech support from Moore-O-Matic (now Linear Corp), Digi-Code or anyone else...PERIOD.After much trial and error I finally got it to work....Matching all positive wires from the old to positive terminals of the new and the same with the negative wires and terminals (now here's the tricky part) reverse, YES, switch, the location of of the emitter and receiver to the opposite sides of the door!!! WHACKY??? YES!! But it works!!I would never buy anything again from Linear Corp...Period."
3,shipping time was quick,"It's a nice product, but it didn't work for me. It might be because I have an older model of garage door opener."
2,Uncomfortable,"Support is ok. It was quite uncomfortable but if you buy it, size up if you're close. Trust me."
5,Superb:-),As an experienced VB6 developer I was always frustrated by the lack of OO capabilities. .NET fixes this. This book provides the right balance of reference material and tutorial material. It serves well for wanting a quick answer and equally as well as a general OOP guide specific to VB.NET. I particularly like the 'best practice' feel of this book. .NET as a whole is quite daunting for VB6 developers; we almost have too many options now available. Learning VB.NET from a VB6 background can be confusing because it's difficult to know where to use all of these new techniques now available. This book goes a very long way to showing us how to write VB.NET classes in a pragmatic way.
4,Where's the C#,"I see your new handbook books, Class Design, Remoting, and Threading, these area specific type books are long overdue from publishers. Great job,however, they are all for visual basic, curious? When will the C# editions be out? I'll take two C#'s each thank you!"
2,Misleading title for the content,"Silly, naive me. I purchased a book with the title ""Visual Basic .NET Class Design Handbook"" in order to learn more about effective class design, and particularly the expectations of previous Wrox books having wonderful practical examples. But you know you've made a mistake when you receive your book and on page 2 read ""This isn't a book about object-oriented analysis and design."" It seems as though someone asked the authors ""What time is it?"" and they wrote a book on how to build a watch and the space/time continuum. I found the single chapter devoted to classes in Sybex's Visual Basic .NET Programming far more valuable than this book. Perhaps it's one of the cases where the title just does not match the intended content -- I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and give two stars instead of one. But I'd also hesitate to ask the authors for directions to the restroom, afraid that I would receive a lecture on the digestive process and the history of plumbing."
3,Good reference only...,"I was kinda disappointed with this book. I relied on the hight reviews that's why I bought it, thinking I'll be learning more on how to design good classes from problem analysis, but didn't get what I was hoping for. The topics discussed in the book can be found in most of VB.net books around, and this book emphasized that it is not an object-oriented type of learning material, so for those beginner OOP programmers like me searching for a good book from problem analysis to class design, look anywhere else and please recommend if you found one."
3,"It's Okay, but Customer Service sucks","We bought this TV 2 years ago for my son. This TV was for his bedroom, we went away for Christmas so we unplugged everything, when we got home he tried to plug his TV in and the ac adapter that the TV uses died. For over a month now we have been looking for a replacement plug, which no one sells, Polaroid states that there is a 60 day backorder for the ac adapter. Plus it is $70 with shipping. Also when I called customer service all they would say is that it is out of warrenty I can ship it back to them for them to fix or fix it on my own.So just keep in mind the customer servoce and the picture is not that clear, I have seen better!"
3,Good Picture...Bad accessibility,"This TV has decent picture. I have had it for almost 3 years coming this Christmas and have not had any problems. My only pet peeve is that when I am changing channels it takes forever to load to the next channel. It is tedious work to change channels because the picture takes forever to come onto the screen. Other than this it is great: has 2 A/V jacks which are very useful. Overall, a decent TV but would not buy again if I had a second chance."
2,Blind Justice,I was dissapointed with this movie. The accents are inaccurate and the story line is not as good as the book on which it has been based.
1,Coffee Grinder,I was very unhappy with this item. It was very loud and didn't grind coffee as fine as I wanted it. I used it for about a month maybe two and it just quit working. Very dissapointed.
2,Very diappointing,"I understand the novella Black Cocktail is only 76 pages long and can't be considered in the same league as Carroll's novels (which I love) - but this was very disappointing.It's as if Carroll, unable to sleep one night, sat down to write a novel, changed his mind, dashed off these pages, and published them without looking them over (or passing them to an editor to read.)Familiar characters and themes without any new revelations...and an ending that seems to have been drawn from a tired mind. I'll keep it along with his other books, but will probably never read this again."
2,Disappointing,As a scrapbooker I saw this on DIY Scrapbooking a while ago and thought it was a must have. For the $$ you are better off buying the plastic templates. These discs aren't that easy to use either.
3,slightly cumbersome,"instructions tell you to adhere it to your mat paper first. it still slips off the edge of the photo from time to time. with today's cutters, it's faster to measure your rectangular/square photos, add double the mat edging you want and cut to size. this product is best suited for oddly shaped or sized photos. so, it definitely has a use, but it's utility depends on your needs."
4,Good,It came exactly the way it said it would. It came on time and was just a little pricier than I expected.
4,good strong coverage of Oracle 8i backup and recovery,"The first five chapters of this book have good technical information, but could be better if expressed more clearly. Forget that! The other five chapters have great technical information and got through to me very well. Chapter 10 is a set of 22 valuable ""case studies"" in which the authors simulate a set of failures they say are representative of DBAs' most common problems. For each, they explain the right DBA reactions; sometimes they explain other reactions and why those are aren't as useful. Good connections with Oracle. Strong technical credibility. Great explanations in the second half. Valuable!"
2,"Smelly, stinky, but does the trick","The stuff really does protect your skin, if you can handle the scent. I had cracks in fingertips that hurt really bad. The lotion helped, but I couldn't stand to leave it on. Might be good if you are working on a car engine, but not for office work/typing. The smell is horrible.The blue/wet Kerodex is much better."
5,wonderful inspiring collection,"Jewish Women Speak is a wonderful sequel to the popular Jewish Matters. JWS is both educating and inspiring, about being a Jew and a Woman.I highly recommend it!D.E."
4,A good book for learning deck construction techniques.,"This book is pretty cool even though it is a little dated. Chapter 3: fast mana sources available to Type II decks. Chapter 5: Metagame. Chapter 7: How to use Nevinyrral's Disk correctly (16 interesting pages). Chapter 8: Using Jayemdae Tome. Chapter 9: Millstone Decks. Chapter 10: Power Surge and Manabarbs Decks. Chapter 11: Zur's Weirding Decks. Chapters 12: Winter Orb Decks. Chapter 13: Stasis Decks. Chapter 14: The 5 basic decks (Hand Destruction, Counterspell, Burn, Fast Creature, & Land Destruction).Bill"
3,Old Edition,"This seller is supplying an out-of-date 1979 edition. Its' fine for personal use, but make sure you get the NEW edition (with a green cover) if you're doing a group study."
2,not the best choice,"Of the three texts I have used to teach college-level ear training, this is definitely the weakest. Most of the material is composed by the authors, and it is often ugly, awkward stuff. The chapters could be definitely be sequenced in a more reasonable way (the minor mode, for example, is not introduced until Ch 6) and the level of difficulty is very poorly managed. Indeed, it doesn't seem like the authors have many good ideas about how students actually learn to sight-sing - many of their primitive early exercises (rhythms without meters, melodies that wander randomly up and down the scale) are actually much more difficult than later ones.I would strongly recommend either Richard's Ottman's ""Music for Sight-Singing"" or Berkowitz-Fontrier-Kraft's ""A New Approach to Sight Singing"" over this book."
5,Birdmen/60Minutes DVD,The footage on this dvd is excellent and watching this story on dvd is much better than a TIVO replay. As for the flying these guys do and the Norwegian landscape . . . both are best described with superlatives.
2,Too dated!,"While some info in the book might still be relevant, it was printed in 1990. This is much to long ago considering there have been 15 years of additional research on reading theory and practice. Had I realized the publication date, I would not have bought it."
5,recent history...,"...excellent movie ... wonderful soundtrack ... it's the only way I've found, to date, to get a recording of Rufus Wainwright's ""Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered"" ..."
3,a good reference,"I tried to make this video part of my workout routine, but I couldn't stick with it. The warm up is too long, leaving insufficient time to learn the postures that follow. The frontal view is confusing, and when Terry mixes up his left & right, it doesn't help! It's an intimidating introduction to T'ai Chi, I had difficulty holding the poses long enough for him to get through the explanations."
3,Helpful and a starting point in Tai Chi,"A good video for a reference. You can also use it for practice between formal lessons. However, there is no substitute for instruction from an experienced teacher. The group learning dynamics are irreplacable. Get the instruction first and then this tape can help you."
5,Terrific Tai Chi DVD!,"This Tai Chi DVD offers an excellent introduction to Tai Chi for those who are more interested in the health benefits of this ancient Chinese martial art. Although the movements are gentle and unhurried, they will greatly increase your lower body strength and overall suppleness. Terry Dunn teaches this art in a relaxed but, engaging manner. I highly recommend this DVD."
4,Excellent instructional video,"An excellent, comprehensive video for learning T'ai Chi.I do wish that he also filmed the moves when he was facing the same way you were, so it would be easier to follow, while watching and doing the moves yourself. But that being said, he explains each move with careful and complete detail so that you can follow along. I would still recommend taking some classes - to keep you from developing bad habits or wrong moves - somethings that a competent teacher will be able to point out.I had studied and practiced T'ai Chi for a few years, some 20 years ago, and this video was all that I needed to get back to where I was then."
2,good foundation but difficult to follow moves,"i think terence dunn does a great job in taking his time to explain each move; however, the warmup is incredibly long and the visual angle/frontal view is extremely confusing for someone who is watching and trying to learn the moves..it's not a mirror image..i was left feeling frustrated instead of relaxed.."
5,Excellent tool for learning and refreshing.,"I have many years of training and exposure to Chinese martial arts, exercise, and philosphy. Terry Dunn's videos for both the long and short forms are very good learning tools. The beginner can get a good grasp of the basics and fundamentals. The more advanced student can glean much from it. I have been using Terry's videos as a reference, refresher, and motivator for close to 10 years. I highly reccomend it for beginner or intermediate student."
3,An objective review! Just three stars,"One of the problems I find out in Amazon reviews is that very few are objective and dispassionate, and what is worst, it seems most of them are made by friends, relatives or disciples of the authors.How can you praise a video that has very poor quality and is dark and consequently it is a poor guide for tai chi learning?In tai chi one of the most important and difficult things to learn is the hands and feet movement and it is almost impossible to follow them by watching this video.The only thing that saves this dvd and why I give 3 stars are the Qi Gong exercises.Finally it is advisable to know before buying it, that Mr Dunn does not do the 24 Yang forms and his positions and movements are significantly different than the done on the popular 24 short form."
4,Slow but sure,"As another reviewer pointed out, this is not an exercise video. It is an instructional video that divides into 4 parts. First, a demonstration of the form accompanied by a monologue about the history and purpose of T'ai Chi. Then, a long warmup with emphasis on introduction to the basic postures of the form. Third, 37 lessons divided into 49 parts. Finally, all the parts are again demonstrated in one continuous movement. At the very end of the video, Dunn states what he should have pointed out at the start: it takes 6 to 18 months to master the forms on the video. That would have alerted some of the people who made negative comments that this is not meant to be just an exercise video. The video accomplishes all it is meant to accomplish and I would have given it a 5 except there are lapses and slowness in places that become annoying."
3,T'ai Chi,"The one reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that it is not possible to scroll through from one segment to another without going in order using FF. I was hoping this DVD version would do that. I have the VHS, & I wanted to make it easier on myself. In fact, that is the only reason I opted for the DVD. Terry Dunn does a remarkable job of teaching, tho. The content is wonderful & deserves 5 stars."
5,Great introduction for beginners,"This is my first Tai Chi tape. I learned the whole 37 postures and flow from this tape, great for beginners. It is very basic but good production, no fancy props. Terrance is an excellent instructor giving clear explanation.For people with normal knees, I think the long warm up with half squat position may hurt their knees. I kind of cheated with short warm up and go to learn the postures directly. When your knees get stronger, you will feel more comfortable.There is actually a book 'Master Cheng's New Method of Taichi Chuan Self-Cultivation' translated by Mark Hennessy (ISBN 1-883319-92-7) that writes out this exact short form in details. The book really helps me to understand the foot positon and to remember the sequence.I recommend this tape for Tai chi beginners."
2,Tai Chi Yawn,"This video has very very poor production values in comaprison to the Living Arts Series. The lighting in the warm up is not good, and creates strange shadows. The warm up itself is quite long and repetitive, and drained my enthusiasm for the exercises to come. It is very difficult to follow a video where one must move in a very exact fashion, but do the exact opposite of what is being shown on the screen. I lost interest and could not integrate this video into my daily practice."
5,Like Having a Grand Master in your living room,"Terry Dunn's ""how to"" video is terrific. I have his ""Tai Chi"" short form on video and now on DVD. A sweetness and wisdom come right through. This guy really knows his stuff and he knows how to teach. He's also right when he says to only use the instructional tape as a supplement to a real teacher, but this tape is an invaluable backup and tool for practicing at home.John"
2,T'ai Chi not so fluid,"Sorry, very hard to use as a work out guide. The various exercises do not follow one another smoothly, but each one loops until you click Next. Having done that, the next exercise does not pick up where the other one left you so you have to scramble to get into the position being shown. The guide mixes up his left and right, putting his weight on his right leg and telling you to put it on the left, for example. The darned FBI warning and a cute Panda bear can't be fast forwarded through so you are left to do warmups waiting, with the clicker in your hand. A new production would be very welcome as he obviously knows his stuff, but we want to follow and imitate, not just watch!"
2,No Review Stated This!,"Otherwise I wouldn't have purchased it! I really wanted a video that would lead me thru the form so I could learn by watching with the end result in my being able to do the Yang Short Form. I actually like the long warm up & his visualization of each of the moves (altho he does mix right & left up!). HOWEVER...when he gets to the Yang Short Form Flow....things go dreadfully wrong. About 1/3rd of the way thru the form he suddenly only shows the upper body all the way to the end. Since Tai Chi is rooted in the energy flowing thru the feet into the ground he has lost all the purpose of the form. And....made it impossible for you to see both hands & feet in conjunction. So you cannot see how to do each move in a continuous 'flow'. Sorry, this is not a good video!"
3,Tai Chi,Husband liked this practice exercise. Was good practice for a beginner. He did get tired of something not moving very fast.
3,Poor film quality,"This should be a good tape. The instructor is good at describing what to do even if he misspeaks (left for right).But, the problem is that it is frustrating to follow this his movement. The set is all white - so you have no frame of reference when the instructor moves around - how far does he move? There are times when the arm movements are blocked from view by his body. The demonstration of the flow at the end of the DVD was so dark that even with the TV brightness set highest, I could barely make out what the instructor was doing."
3,"The 37 form, not the common 24 posture form",Please be aware that this is the Yang 37 posture form and not the more common Yang 24 posture form that is usually taught to beginners. For my complete review see the the VHS version.
2,Poor production quality,"The video is fairly useful. However, Terry Dunn frequently mixes up left and right in his oral description of what to do. This means you can never rely on what he's saying and have to keep looking at the video (which can be inconvenient for several of the positions). This compounds the problem of having to do the ""opposite"" of what you're looking at. The scences where he says ""left"" where he should have said ""right"" should have been redone. The more times you play the tape the more the left/right problem gets annoying!"
4,Tai Chi DVD,The DVD is a good way to go over the moves. I would notrecommend it for someone who is not working with an instructor. But it is an outstanding addendum to a class or review for someone who needs a refresher.
2,Thumbs down,"Seeing that someone had rated this five stars, I took a chance on the Amazon ""opened video cannot be returned"" policy and bought this. I really regret it!From a video quality perspective this video is high schoolish. The nauseatingly pink background that takes up a solid 1 hour of this video. The titles convinced me that this seventeen dollar video was not worth it.The Tai Chi presentation is 60 minutes long without a break in the pink background, and without titles of names of movements such as ""Single Whip"" etc. Thus, it is very difficult to stop the tape and learn a movement in the middle of the 8 minute Form by skipping through in fast-forward.The exercise sessions seemed worth going through, but all in all, if Amazon didn't have a ""opened videos cannot be returned"" policy, this video wouldn't be taking up space in my video collection."
2,Potential lost,"Excellant choice of trials, but writers extreme political bias reflected in description of trials and did not provide a clear view."
4,hematology and oncology secrets,"As a physician assistant working in a medical hematology/oncology practice, I find this book to be invaluable. It explains the pathophysiology of the diseases at a level down from the oncologist, yet detailed enough to be educational. It is also good for quick reading. However, it is now 6 years old and with all the advancements in cancer treatment, needs to be updated. I am waiting for a new edition, yet it doesn't appear as if one is forthcoming. Therefore it is good for the basics, but as many treatments have changed and improved, it may be best to wait until the next edition, if there is one."
5,One of Brenda's Best!,"I recommend this salsa cd to all Brenda K.Starr fans. I specially love the song ""Rabia"" and ""Ese Hombre"" with Victor Manuelle. This is my favorite of her Spanish releases. Brenda has a very unique voice and it's great singing freestyle and Salsa! I can't wait for her new release in 7/2005"
4,Well done,"I don't tend to watch this kind of film but I found Secret Smile to be well done. Creepy without being overly gross. David Tennant was particularly good. The way ""Brandon Block"" could, with tender and gentle touch and great goodwill in his eyes, deliver an oblique threat or be just flat inappropriate was really creepy at times. This film is good for it's genre."
4,You're going to be surprised!,"I am a big fan of Tennant as Doctor Who. I've also enjoyed his work in Fright Night, Hamlet, Harry Potter, and his amazing performance as Casanova. But I was not ready for the shocking performance he gives here. He will blow you away and really truly make you hate him. You don't think Dr. Who when you see him. He's an utterly different person.But Kate Ashfield was equally wonderful. Amazing work from both of them. I will seek her work out in the future.It's a familiar story which we've seen before in lots of bad movies. The performances are what elevate this. I do want to complain about the presentation. I know its not a Blu-Ray, but the colors on this disc are faded and washed out. It looks like a very old TV show from 20 years ago whose prints haven't been taken care of. Also, the DVD menu is amateurish. So, I am subtracting a star for the presentation, but not the performance."
2,Format Problems :-(,"I must have missed a note somewhere in the product description showing that this dvd is not formatted for North America, so I wasn't able to watch it on my did player. A friend had a foreign player, though so we were able to watch it that way. The story is a little weak. You spend a lot of time thinking that people are simply not dim or gullible enough to believe a complete stranger over someone they've known for years. Very similar to Lifetime movies. If you're looking for something good with David Tennant I recommend Blackpool, but you'll need a special player for that one too, if you're in the States."
1,Read the Book,"Whatever merits the actors may or may not have, this movie is a great example of how the screenwriter/director/whomever can take the content of a great book and shift it so as to make it a different story. And then call it by the name of the book to get that audience. Artistic license, phooey! Shooting necessity, phooey! It's like saying 'Oh, I have (a desk) just like that; except, it's smaller, it's not wood but metal, and the drawers are on the right, not the left.'"
2,remix again!,"if you are looking for the original version of songs ""I can't stand the rain"" and ""One way ticket"", you will be disappointed."
2,"I want the original versions of ""I can't stand the rain "" & ""One way ticket""!!","This is the 2nd issue of Eruption's greatest hits, I don't know why the CD didn't include the original versions, it may include them as well as the remixed versions, very very disappointed."
1,ring towel holder,Good looking metal rings for towels.no installation needed. just hang on dooror drawer. No damage to cabnets.
5,"""Storm Warning"": A Great American Classic","I just finished watching ""Storm Warning"". Let me tell you that it is a great movie. I have'nt seen many old moveis (only the original ""Dracula"") but I fell in love with this one. I am now an old movie fan.I origionaly got this because of Ronald Reagan, and he gives a great preformance, but the real magic is behind this allstar suppoeting cast. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I suggest this to anyone and everyone. It speaks of the American ""untouchables"": the Klan. I think it was well done. Bravo!!!"
4,Ginger & Doris vs. the Klan!,"I don't know why this DVD is so hard to get. Can it be that the subject matter is still too sensitive? This was a truly groundbreaking film in 1951, tackling the evils of the KKK, with strong performances from Ginger Rogers, Doris Day and Steve Cochran. Ronald Reagan is wooden as usual, and the role certainly should have been given to a stronger actor. Despite Reagan, this is an absorbing and compelling film that deserves rediscovery."
2,story about racism,nonsense story. expected better from a reagon film. Must have been in vogue at that time.photography was excellent. Sound OK.
5,Suspenseful!,"This was a really good movie. Doris Day made me dislike her character and Ginger Rogers, she really pulled out all the stops! She was an amazing actress."
4,Arrived in good order and fast. Thanks,"I wanted this classic moviefor sometime as I have seen it on Video. The story line about the KKK and the dramatic role that Ginger Rogers plays in it, was I thought very good for the time and cosidering the musicals she has been in."
4,Lego Ferrari F1,"This set is a good value. It's got a working engine and lookssurprisingly realistic. It's about 18.5"" long. It's a goodvalue for lego.So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well, it has no suspension like the Lego Silver Champion and Williams F1 cars. Also, thecar tends to be a little flimsy. It has cheesy construction. Still a good value.For a more realistic model, look at the lego Williams F1 racer.It has more details, and costs about twice as much."
4,"Expensive, But Worth It","Imagine the heavy sound of early Hawkwind, with 90's electronic dance rhythms, a feminine touch, and a singer that occasionally sounds like a hyperactive Ozzy Ozbourse, and you may have an idea of what Omnia Opera sound like. The six-piece band moves from hard-edged space rock with grooving beats like the opening cut ""Annihilation"" and the excellent, hyperkinetic ""Braindance"" to the surprisingly folksey ""Slide"" with lilting female vocals, to the ambient electronica of ""Astonomica"" and ""Raindance"", without ever losing a distinct sound that is all their own. Despite the import price, it is well worth it. A great 70's sound, updated for the 90's making it fresh and original. Fans of Ozric Tentacles and Porcupine Tree will love it, and old fans of Pink Floyd and Hawkwind should find plenty here to like as well."
2,HIGH DEF SCREW ON LENS?,"I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW THIS SELLER CAN CALL A SCREW ON LENS ""HIGH DEF"" ITSEEMS LIKE THEIR TRYING TO CONVINCE FOLKS THAT THESE LENS ARE SPECIAL BY CALLING THEM ""HIGH DEF"" AS FAR AS I KNOW ONLY THE CAMERA ITSELF CAN PRODUCE A HIGH DEF REPRODUCTION, NOT THE LENS! ITS ABOUT THE IMAGE SIZE AND HOW ITS PROCESSED AND REPRODUCED."
4,Detailed Bible Study,"Lin Johnson teaches you how to encourage people in realistic ways. I did this Bible study with a class of 8-12 adults last summer (2009). I think everyone got a lot out of it, especially lesson on Romans 12."
5,Very high quality knife,"This is the second shun knife I have bought through Amazon Lightning deals for a bargain. These knives are worth full retail however. They are extremely nice looking, feel extremely comfortable in hand, and are extremely sharp. There is almost no resistance when cutting things, it just glides through whatever your cutting. I highly reccomend these over heavy German knives."
4,Best knife in the world?,"Well... I used to buy everyone those Wusthof tomato knives from TJ's or Marshall's CLEARANCE bins for $12. But now, they're pretty much all gone. This is better in that the boron cobalt steel has a HRC of ~64. So, you don't have to find someone to sharpen all the serrations and such. Is it WORTH five times MORE? Well, that depends on how many people you need to serve each tomato with?"
2,Hollow & Distorted Snapshots,"Each of the women profiled in Holland's book are certainly facinating. It's her treatment of these subjects that I found rather insipid. Holland writes from a 19th century perspective, as if there has been no advancement in the status of women over the course of the last century. Her quips did little to raise my interest and, in my opinion, only served to diminish the important lives that she so lopsidedly profiled. From which backwards planet does she hail?"
3,A feminist treat,"This collection of stories about adventurous women is a true inspiration, stirring the feminist in all of us. It makes you proud to be female and thus somehow related to the women in the book."
2,Darn Remakes!,"I have always loved the older version staring Hayley Mills and was curious to see how the remake measured up. Need less to say, I was not impressed. More often than not, I find sequels and remakes to be worse than the originals. This is just another example and the only outstanding part I found really funny was Zeke trying to think and act like a cat.It's likabe for kids because it's an ""up-to-date"" version. But in my opinion the older movie is much more entertaining, especially for adults. Besides it follows the book a lot closer than the newer production. I recommend seeing the old classic verses this one."
3,Not nearly as good as the original!,"While the remake version of ""That Darn Cat"" was pretty good, it pales in comparison to the classic original with the Siamese Cat. Instead of spending my money on this version, I will anxiously await the day when the original 1965 version of ""That Darn Cat"" comes to DVD !"
2,Lamentable remake of Disney classic.,"A sad,sorry remake of the 1965 classic which contains none of its warmth and charm. Watching remakes such as this only highlights the superiority of the original and seems to elevate it even further in quality."
2,"Funny,but at parts boring","This movie was saved by the FBI agent. He was very funny, and in my opinion the only good part of the film. I would recommend this film to anyone who might like cats, but even then you might not want to waste your time...."
2,A poor attempt,"I remember watching the original 1965 version of ""That Darn Cat,"" and I loved every minute of that film. I also remember loving the original 1961 version of ""The Parent Trap."" I had seen the remake of ""The Parent Trap"" and loved it, so I thought I'd give this remake a chance. Bad move.The remake is so far removed from the original I almost didn't believe it was the same story. Too many little ""mini stories"" (for lack of a better word) distracted me from understanding the main plot. The script is bad, the acting is mediocre at best, and the story line is confusing and overly complicated.I would advise you not to see this poorly done remake. Stick to the original."
1,Ewwww,"As a cat lover, I was inclined to go see this movie. Instead of a funny cat flick, I found a movie with an unbelievable plot and WAY to much violence. My advice: Don't waste your time on this trashy film."
3,"Cute, enjoyable fun!","No, it's not worthy of an Oscar, but it was good for a little over an hour's worth of entertainment, especially if you're a cat lover."
1,o my god 1 of the worst movies i ever saw,"i was 9 when I saw that Movie and belive Me you couldn't give me money to see it again, it had a terrible plot and the acting was so bad. I pity the fool Who even Rents this movie and if they got it for keeps, They would shot themselfs as i said before WORST MOVIE IN THE WHOLE DAMN WORLD! (well at least 1 of them)"
2,Enciclopedia de los gatos,esperaba mas informacion de gatos es bien pero no excelente el libro esta algo viejo por la informacion necesita ser actualizado
2,Too violent for me,"Naturally, the animation isn't as good as Disney's but I wasn't expecting it to be as good. I was hoping for a kinder gentler version of Little Red Riding Hood and I was disappointed. Just too scary for my taste. I prefer ""Storyteller's Classics"" with Dudley Moore."
5,CAN NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN ONCE YOU START!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LEARNED MORE AND WAS ENTERTAINED MORE ABOUT THE WILD WEST ""GOLD FEVER"" DAYS THAN ANY OTHER BOOK!! IT WAS SO GREAT I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN UNTIL THE LAST PAGE! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK!! THIS IS A MUST BOOK FOR ALL WHO LOVE THE HISTORY AND GLAMOUR OF THE WILD, WILD WEST'S GLORY DAYS!!!!!"
5,"Wow, amazing!","Great book, made my girlfriend quite happy. She is very into Japanese street fashion and this book just captivated her, she looked through it about 20 times the day i gave it to her. I enjoyed it too, but it was mainly for her."
5,There's another book?,"I picked up this book because of the cover and am happy I did. The street fashion, from Punk to LA, from Doll to Comfortable, is a wonder to behold. It's a rainbow of clothes selected by many people for many reasons. I really enjoy flipping thru the pages and I didn't know there was another book!I plan to get the first book also!"
3,Fresh Fruits,The book is basically a collection of photos based upon the fashions in tokyo which is fasciniating to look at but i foundthe text difficult to read due to the colours used against the background . I would have also liked to of read more about the people and what inspired them to create the visions that we are looking at. I would have liked more evening shots because having been to tokyo and seen the street fashions thats when the fashion really comes alive so i found some the pictures a bit repetitive. I was impressed with the service from Amazon. It was the first time i'd ordered and the service was first class. I was actually struggling to buy the book in the uk but amazon got it for me .
1,worst c.d.r.!s ever,Don!t buy. The worst c.d.r.!s ever. Has an extremely low burn rate. Most of them I had to throw away. Don!t waste you money.
5,Great for audio and svcd video.,This are great for all your audio and video needs the only one I use to make my svcd and they are great for your audio needs.If you have a apex dvd player and have found that your svcd skip or jump try this media and you shouldnt have a problem.
1,Ditto,"I experienced the exact same problems as the previous reviewer--the headband piece snapped after a couple of months, and for whatever reason, there were sound problems in the right headphone, I had to adjust the cord a certain way to hear from it better."
2,Maxell HP2000 Studio Series - I would avoid.,"At first, I sort of liked these headphones. They aren't very loud, even with the adjustable volume on the cord, but the overall sound was/is decent.However, WOW are they uncomfortable. The squeeze my head and ears so tightly that it gives me a headache after only a few minutes, and God help you if you wear glasses at the same time - it's like Medieval torture. I also have a pretty small head, so that's saying something. My husband won't even wear them, he hates them so much. The ""stretch"" band is so taught that it pulls the headphones upward on your head, constricting your ears and making it virtually impossible to get a good fit. Maybe it's ok for tweens, but I doubt they would like the look of these either.Honestly, I bought a cheap pair of plastic headphones from China that are more comfortable and sound just as good. The Syba Binaural white sets are 10 times better as well, and they're kinda snazzy looking to boot."
1,Unable to use due to perceived design flaw,"I can't review the sound quality of these headphones because I never got as far as plugging them in.The spring loaded scalp pad is so strong that I had to forcefully pull the ear cups down to completely cover my ears. Once I let go of the cups, the spring then tries to pull the cups back towards the top of my head. I found this to be too uncomfortable and distracting to put to any further use.I also consider the two leads from the volume control to the ear cups to be too long (18"") and too thin, and worry that they may be prone to tangling and breakage."
5,Great book!,This book covers pretty much every important thing there is in Microsoft TCP/IP. The explanations were very clear and use of drawings and figures were very helpful. I would recommend this book for anyone who plan on taking the Microsoft TCP/IP exam or someone who is just looking for a book for references on TCP/IP.
5,A Good Foundation Book and More !,I used this book as the core training tool for TCP/IP. The sections were well done and right on target for my TCP/IP Test. I highly recomend this book as a reference for any TCP/IP library. I passed my test 1st time through - Nicely Done.
5,Clear and Understandable w/ Microsoft point of view,"A great help to anyone dealing with TCP/IP and Microsoft at the same time. Heywood begins with a good theoretical overview and then provides specific, detailed examples. Unlike the many books on TCP/IP assume either a UNIX or a programming background, Heywood's book deals with TCP/IP from more of a network technicians view point. He provides a solid foundation to build upon."
2,umm Wow,This movie was low bugdet and. lame . i wouldnt even recoment you rent it save you money michael blackson was not even funny in this move
1,More of the same...,"I should of known better, but I decided to get this book anyway, my hope being that Ru Emerson would be able to do a better job with a three-book plot line than her earlier books.I was wrong. Xena and Gabrielle seem to be different people. Joxer seems to be right out of the second season and has not been allowed to show his development at all. Even Draco seemed to be slightly off.Will somebody ask Ru Emerson to watch the shows or at least talk to somebody on the show?"
3,Super Reader,"Menelaus and his scheming priest Avicus have a scam going. They want young men to believe they are going on a hero's quest, when all Menelaus wants to do is get Helen back.Joxer is dumb enough to fall for this, and given the priest knows who he is, and that he can manipulate Xena through him, he takes full advance. Xena's old lay Draco, the warlord, and a young Bellerophon are also involved.As the first of a trilogy, it ends with the travelling three on a ship travelling further towards where Menelaus wants them to be."
2,Just Doesn't Cut It,"I Just finished reading the first two books based on Hercules and Xena. BY THE SWORD by Timothy Boggs was the better of the two. THE EMPTY THRONE by Ru Emerson was not quite as enjoyable.Having seen Xena rescue the arc of the Covenant, Defend Troy, save Helen and meet Homer, Xena goes to Ithaca and gets involved in the Odyssey (Homer is still a young boy and has never met any of the heroes). Unfortunately it lacked the fun and silliness that runs throughout the series. Although I do like the way Homer was in diapers at the start of the Trojan war. Really.I had hoped that books based on the series would get better with time (like they did with Star Trek) but there were only a few and now the series has ended. Oh, well. If you really liked the show, you should probably skip this one. Ru Emerson is a talented writer but the nuances of are just not her style."
3,It was a bit disappointing,I was disappointed in that X and G were not together in most of the plot's mission. It seems like with all the complaining G did it would have been explained somewhere in the story.
2,"What is up""",After reading Emerson's latest installation of Xena books I have to wonder why she didn't call them Gabrielle: Warrior Bard. The book seemed to center entirely around Gabrielle. And if that wasn't enough she hinted at a relationship between Ares and Gabrielle. AS IF!
2,TOO MUCH JOXER! NOT ENOUGH XENA AND GABRIELLE!,"When I watch the tv show, Joxer is OK at best as the comic relief on the show. When I read this book I was not happy with his role in it. His character is just too stupid to be of any use to Xena and Gabrielle. If you're going to have Hercules in the book he should've have played a bigger role in it. He's just in there for Xena to deliver a message to? In the future don't waste such valuable characters in a book like that. After reading this first book in the trilogy, I'm not anxiously awaiting the next book in the series. Maybe I'm being a little too hard on this book because Ru is setting up the storyline in this first book (I hope so). I found myself not able to put the book down because I just wanted to get to the end of it. Less Joxer and more Xena and swordplay would've helped this book a lot."
2,Xena???,"Ru Emerson is maybe a good writer but she dont know anything about Xena! All those books suck, By the gods!!!"
2,What's going on here?,"A lot of the Greek names used in this book are simply inexistent and there are several other inaccuracies. Furtermore, it's not a book that could satisfy an adult fantasy reader, it might satisfy a child, though..."
3,Fit in Tight Space but Overpriced,"This did the trick on a very small space where I needed a narrow undermount. It looks nice and has a good quality stainless finish. I think it is overpriced for what you get though. You can buy a full sized cast iron on amazon for a lot less. This is just a pressed stainless sink. If you need something this size, it will do fine. If you can take something bigger look around more."
5,now i listen two H.I.M alot!!!,i use two hate H.I.M but my friend she use two listen two RIGHT HERE IN MY ARMS all the time one day she let me listen two THE FUNERAL OF HEARTS i fell in love with it now i listen two H.I.M alot!!! i love H.I.M
4,A look at women in Africa,"The bride price is paid and a young Nigerian girl is sent off to Lagos to a man she has never met. She struggles through the years to bear his children. She feeds and clothes them, something her husband seems unwilling or unable to do so. He marries other women, yet is unwilling to give his first wife the honor she is due. In the end, he rejects her for his youngest wife, and she must return in shame to her family. This book is well worth reading to explore the conflicts of traditional life and colonial life in Nigeria, as well as many other African countries."
1,sucrose = sugar,How is this product sugar free when the first inactive ingredient listed is sucrose? That's table sugar.
1,Seems the TV just isn't a good choice.,Same thing. Circuit City. Doesn't work. Cheaper to buy a new one than fix. Stay away from this unit. What does Polaroid make that's any good???
5,Still Going Strong,"I'm Guessing I purchased mine back in 2005. It's now Jan 2013 and this Monitor is still going strong. Never had a hiccup. Knock, knock, knock.. that's me knocking on wood. Just thought I'd share that this unit has always been a strong performer for me. Good luck with your endeavors."
4,Polaroid 32 inch 3201 LCD,"Honestly for the price I couldn't be happier with this TV. It's now going on 4 years and I haven't had one problem with it. I use this TV as a dual purpose unit. It's main purpose serves as my PC LCD and it's 2nd purpose is for an Xbox 360. I'm able to run the PC resolution at 1280 by 720 through a DVI connection which gives me plenty of desktop real estate.The other purchasers of this unit must have purchased lemons because I haven't had any trouble with it. 4 years ago I paid nearly $1000 for it at CC and it was worth every penny. I didn't give it a 5 because it's far from perfect. However, for the price I highly recommend it."
5,A modern classic!,This book is an absolute marvel! I've read it to many of my classes and they were delighted to say the least. The illustrations are simply fantastic and the wonderfully written tale holds a moral that is important for children of all ages. I can't recommend this highly enough and only wish I could award it more than 5-stars. My students and I anxiously await the next installment from Mr. Shaboo and Ms. Churchill.
5,Shalamazoo is a great book for you!,"This book happened to have arrived at the exact moment my niece was arriving at my house. I read the book to her and she was totally engrossed in the story and pictures. The book tells a simple story with a very simple message: ""Enjoy Life"". The author's way with words makes a fun and interesting book to read, Shalamazoo has a fantastic rythm to it. (I suggest reading it once alone to get the hang of it before reading it before an audience, you'll see what I mean). Get this book! My neice will not stop saying ""Shamamazoo"". My wife and I cannot wait for the next installment from Mr. Shaboo!"
1,Not put together well,"My biggest problem is that it assumes the record keeper is female. The book is organized for ""Your Family"", and ""Your Husband's Family"". All throughout the book, they do not consider the possiblity that the record keeper just may possibly be a man.The book is quite thin, and I found it very quirky that it asks your family members to fill out a section entitled, ""first paycheck"". I gave up filling this book out, and tossed it."
1,Buyer's Remorse,Wish I had read katskillkid's review before I bought my copy (not from Amazon).My copy has several skips and also places where it plays white noise at top volume.Not pleasant.
1,Simply a horrible album,"How disappointing! I thought that this c.d. would be filled with songs like ""Get Back"", (which, by the way is the only good song on this worthless c.d.)but instead I found it filled with lame attempts to be 311 and the Beastie Boys. For those of you out there who want a c.d. that fuses rap and metal, and are buying this c.d. on the strength of ""Get Back"" alone will be very disappointed with Zebrahead, and instead should buy a c.d. by Limp Bizkit or the Beastie Boys. Most of the lyrics on this album are stupid and cliched, and on most of the songs, you can't even understand what the singer is saying. This disc is, quite simply, pathetic."
5,this is the best cd i have heard in the last year,zebrahead is sweet. their cd rocks and they are great in concert. i know they will make it big soon.
5,Just buy it okay,"One hell of a CD, like nothing you have heard before. Its a bit like 311, 2 skinnee J's and maybe a little Limp Bizkit, but better than all. Very Hip Hoppy, sometimes more upbeat,sometimes more heavy, always fun. The band is even better in concert if you can imagine! Well but it!"
5,AWESOME SUMMER MUSIC!!!!!,"once i played ""waste of mind"" for the 1st time i was hooked! this guy can rap so kool mixed in with cool guitar. its like 311 but 3 times better. This album is a must for bbq summer dayz. best songs are: ""get back"", ""someday"", ""feel this way"", ""move on"", ""fly daze"". Plus the rest of the cd is good. Definately kool ear kandy!!!!!!!"
2,"I was expecting more ""Yellow""","When I bought this album I was expecting it to be much like Zebrahead's first album (refered to as the ""Yellow Album""), considering that most of the songs from this album where first on Yellow. However I was very dissapointed to find out that the songs were all re-mixed and sounded vaguely like there counterparts from Yellow. I now own every Zebrahead CD I'd have to say that this is the worst Zebrahead CD of them all. It has neither the raw energy of Yellow, the pop hooks of Playmate of the Year, the street-feel of MFZB, or the pop-punk attitude of Broadcast to the World.If you're considering buying this CD, I'd really reccomend you save your money for another Zebrahead album."
3,more imagination needed,"This playmate video while nice is lacking in some areas. what i dont get about these playmate videos is that they give the lesser looking playmates the hotter segments while the hotter playmates get lame segments. take jamie westenhiser who is smoking hot. both of her sets while alright(just b/c she is so hot) are lacking. in the first part of jamies set, shes on a beach and deosnt even get naked. u only get quick glimpes of her naked body and barely get to check out her rearend. jamies next segment starts out alright with her stripping out of her suit dress but this extremely hot introduction is cut short so jamie can bathe. yeah she looks good bathing, but i wanted to see more of her buns walking around in garters. same type of stuff with destiny's segment. why cant playboy get a better director? this video is nice because the girls are hot, but a lot of the segments could be done better."
2,old and very general,"Try something else, this is an old collection of tips that will not help your game much. Leadbetter is a great teacher--but these lessons are just not worth the money, try some other dvds."
2,Not the best!,"Too much basic stuff, not enough significant instruction. I would not pay for instruction from this teacher. This DVD lacks too much."
4,It's like having your own private golf coach.,"Some great tips and great drills. Also, very good graphics and camera angles to illustrate his points. It is no wonder, he is one of the best golf instructors around. I can't stand the he wears his clothes, especially that he pulls his pants up to his chest, but that should not detract from his excellent instruction."
5,A wonderful documentary film,"Ten non-professional pianists over 35, compete in the Van Cliburn Piano Competition at Texas Christian University. Expertly filmed, the movie is about these amateurs who gave up music to pursue careers in business and medicine, only to return for this intense competition. As entertaining as the piano playing is, the intimate portraits of the competitors is equally so; a Haitian American doctor, a Russian refugee, an Alabama ophthalmologist, a graduate of the Air Force Academy, an Aids sufferer, a French woman tennis instructor, an engaging and funny Moldavian woman, a jeweler with rings on his fingers, and more.And the winner is...."
5,Speechless with admiration,"I'm writing this before having read the other reviews. I see their 5-star ratings, an opinion I share, but know I won't be able to come close, verbally or musically, to matching their knowledgeable reviews.That out of the way, let me say only that this fascinating, entertaining documentary should be watched by all of us who do something for the love of it, by all of us who have day jobs that pay the rent but who have dreams that pay the soul.It doesn't matter if you don't much like the piano or classical music. This delightful documentary is about people.The pianists are wonderful, both as musicians and as people. The director, editor and cameramen are to be applauded for bringing us a masterpiece. The Van Cliburn folks are due our inadequate gratitude for making all of this possible.This DVD is being added to my Deserted Island list. Not sure yet whether in the movie or the music list, but no doubt it's being added."
4,Spellbound with Grownups,Loved seeing adults following a passion. Loved the variety of people focused on. Loved that I became fond of people I initially didn't care for.
2,Just Not That Interesting and Not Enough Music,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I did not find this film entertaining or interesting. I love playing/studying piano and I enjoy watching DVD's of great masters play. I also like anyone who can play half-way decent as all of these folks can. Unfortunately, the focus is mostly on the stories behind the playing and not the actual piano playing itself. I did not find the stories that spectacular. For instance, we see people getting on planes, saying how much they wan to really win, seeing their houses and dogs (!) et al.Most of the clips of the pieces played are only 10-30 seconds and the pieces are often not identified clearly. Just when you see their musical talent emerging, were off packing the bags! This is not to say anything against the great folks in the film, just that the premise of the amateur drive to compete in a piano competition didn't work for me."
5,Id get more,These magnets are too funny. Have them in my kitchen and I love looking at them everytime I go in there.
4,Radiant Heater,"It does what radiant heaters do: warm the surfaces of items (or people) within range of its 2x400w heating elements. In my experience, that range is about 4'. It does not heat a room. Neither does it heat air particularly well. As long as you don't expect it to make a cold room warm (like a forced-air heater would), you won't be disappointed.PS: It's great for warming up pink winter cheeks."
5,A complete and fair review,"This space heater has worked flawlessly for the past 2 years. It has never malfunctioned, is pretty durable, and I plan to use it until it quits working. I may have been lucky with the unit I purchased, but it's dependable and I would definetly purchase again. I've read other reviews on Amazon that state Consumer Reports says that it's a safety risk? That is complete and utter nonsense. As long as you use your brain with this heater, and do not store clothes on it or try to have sex with it or anything else, you'll be perfectly fine. If your stupid enough to put any combustible material infront of any space heater, maybe you deserve to lose your house and belongings. If your thinking about purchasing this unit, know this, it has been an awesome purchase for me..."
3,Died in 9 months of infrequent use,"The product heat up my body fast but produce a little smell in the first few minutes, this happens every time I turn it on. Both bulbs would not light up after 9 months of infrequent use. Hopefully I can return it to the manufacturer. Will comment on how it will turn out in about a month. If the seller isn't Amazon, I would have rate it 2 stars."
2,Heats well but tips over too easily,"This little heater does a good job of heating small areas, even on the lower setting. But, and this is a big problem, it tips over when virtually anything touches it. My cat rubbed against it gently, when it was off, and over it went. Another time, I brushed against it and, again, it tipped over. It's obviously top heavy. I wish I could give it a better review but it's instability is potentially dangerous, even with the tip-over switch on the bottom. I simply don't trust it, so back it goes."
2,Problems,"This heater works very well and looks good. It seems to be a very high efficiency design.However!When this heater arrived I found that one of the electric cord brackets was broken and this type of plastic is dificult to glue. I did not return it because I needed it now not in two weeks. The Amazon shipping box did not show signs of stress so I must assume the damage was caused before it was packed for shipping.Also, the dial (switch) is positioned and marked in such a way it is difficult to see what setting you are switching to (400W or 800W) when it is on the floor."
4,Good Secondary Heater,"This is an attractive, solid little quartz space heater. It seems well-built and is the best quality quartz heater I have had so far.It is not 5 star for the following reasons:1. Quartz elements are not replaceable with this heater - lifespan for these elements should be approx. 5000 hrs of use. That is max three years use in cold climates - mailing the whole heater to the manufacturer and being gone 6-8 weeks is not an option. So, this is a throw-away heater.2. No thermostat - I reason that there is no thermostat because the manufacturer is trying to get you to use it sparingly to increase the life of the quartz elements.This should be a good addition to your primary heater on cold days/nights - just realize it will have a short lifespan."
5,Low wattage,"I use this heater in a SMALL room that has no aux heat. Set on 400 watts, other setting is 800, it will keep the room very warm. It has ""no thermostat"" so its either on of off. Very energy efficient."
3,Infrared junior,Ordered two Optimus H-5210 heaters. Amazon amazed me once again by getting them to me next day freight free. After setting the heaters up I was a bit disappointed by the low amount of heat they put out. They are in a room about 12' X 20' with 8' ceilings & relatively well insulated. I should have bought larger heaters.
4,Warm,"This unit is excellent. I use it at my cubicle at work, and it is super quick to heat up. I'm frequently cold, but I rarely need to put my unit on the high setting. The only negative is that it is a pretty large unit, for under a cubicle."
3,It's probably not a bad heater,I think I would have really liked it if it had worked for more than an hour. I got one of the odd defective ones. Amazon made return and refund simple and efficient. I bought a different heater of the same brand and have been using it happily for several weeks now.
3,decent space heater,"I mean I guess it's expected that it won't heat a whole room with no fan or anything like that.It's small, compact, but strong in a short range, and in a straight line.Be careful putting it too close to anything leather, 'cause it'll melt it.You get what you paid for."
5,It works great and it's warm,"It works excellent. Keeps me and my kids warm. It warms up real fast and you have 2 settings: the 400watts setting will light up the top beam and the 800watts will light up both beams inside and keeps you real toasty. My only wish is that it blew warm air. That would've made it more perfect, but at $20 what more can I ask for?"
1,poor quality,Does not put out enough heat. I had it in a very small space and it only put out a very small amount of heat. Not worth it! I would not recommend.
3,Made so cheaply,"Just took this out of the box and was not happy with the look of it, looks and feels too cheap. We thought it was made out of meatl being it is a heater but it is not. This heater is very light in weight and is made with mostly plastic, I hope it does not melt? The only reason we ordered it was they had a 3 heater package deal and this was one of the three. So far it is working pretty good and is very quiet but I am worried about the plastic used to house the heating elements.I would not recommend this heater if you have pets or little kids since it can be tipped over so easy due to not having any weight to it. I would send it back but since I got it with the package deal I guess we keep it. I do not expect this heater to last too long as I think the heating element will melt the plastic after prolong use. I will say it is heating and it is very quiet so it does have a few things going for it."
3,Needs timer to turn off automatically,"I use it under my desk at home.Benefits:-- This heater provides much more heat than the ceramic heater that it replaces at 1/4th the wattage. I never need more than 400w so it's much more energy efficient.-- There is NO annoying fan noise - absolutely quiet.However:-- Because it's quiet, I forget that it's on and often forget to turn it off. THIS UNIT NEEDS A SHUT OFF TIMER! Because I often leave it on overnight by accident, any energy efficiency is lost. This is a big detraction, and possible fire danger. This is why I only rated 3 stars.-- Even at 400w, you cannot keep this close to your skin, it's that hot. If you cannot keep at least at least a foot away from you, do not buy. This unit needs a 200W mode."
4,Good for an average size room,"Nice and quiet, small and lite weight. heats our office (like a 10'x10' room) pretty well. I don't know how well it would do with a larger room though."
4,Optimus,"This heater heats two small rooms adequately, but is not necessarily a huge money-saver on my energy bill compared to last year."
1,Worked only for a week!,Used to use it only at night time. But still it broke in a weeks time! Very disappointing with this product. Unfortunately I threw away the product box or would have returned it! Won't recommend it to anyone!
3,"quiet, good for heating you up but not the room","it's an infrared heater so it's good for heating you up if you sit right infront of it, however the rest of the room will remain fairly cold. its totally silent, which is great, though i prefer my micathermic heater because it's fast, silent, and will heat the rest of the room."
3,"Good, worth the price","This heater works OK in close ranges. Can get a bit too hot, though, and you can't control which area (top or bottom) is on and which is off if you only want half strength. Not effective in medium or far ranges. The safety function (for tipping over) works well."
5,great,quiet and runs warm enough for bath time for the kids. It's a great solution for a very good price.
4,Surves its purpose,I bought the heater to use in my chilly classroom. It has worked great so far. It heats up quick and is absolutely silent. Silent is the best part. It was inexpensive so I did not have high expectations but I am satisfied with my purchase.
2,Worked great for short time,"I bought this heater last year for my office, which in a converted porch and gets chilly in the fall and winter. It worked great and I loved it -- on average, I ran it for about 4-6 hours a day. But it stopped working after one season -- which is, I think, an inadequate useful life for a small appliance. It turns on now and heats up -- and then promptly shuts off. Will be getting rid of it and buying a new one from a different manufacturer."
4,GREAT VALUE FOR THE $,Heats smaller rooms very well. Would not be good if you had small children because it is hot to touch.
5,Great Heater,I highly recommend this little heater. It saves on electricity as I only have to use the 400 watt setting and it really puts out the heat.
5,good item for good price,"it's really good price and you can choose 400w or 800w, and it stopped when it's unbalance, and you can use it the whole day long and it seems works very safely"
2,"I really can't express what a waste of money this heater is :-{ I love Amazon, but I don't like this heater","I did research and compared heaters, I took my time and I thought ""OPTIMUS"" brand and this particular heater was the right choice for me. I bought it last winter 12/2011 & it worked fine. I pulled it out this winter 12/2012 & it DOES NOT WORK!!!!!! I bought two(2) of this particular heater. In total I bought three (3) OPTIMUS brand heaters last winter and all three have stopped working after one(1) season of use. :-{"
2,A space heater for a VERY limited space,"This thing is nice and toasty if you sit right in front of it. But, if you move 3 feet away, you no longer feel the heat. Does not seem to heat up a room. When sitting on the couch, it's nice and warm when placed on the coffee table right in front of me. But, the person sitting 2 feet away next to me can't feel it. Probably would work great for putting under a desk at work."
5,Great Buy!!!,This little heater works fantastic!! We use it for our home/office. We use it on low and it heats up the whole room to about 78 degrees. Costs hardly anything to run. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to cut their electric bills down.
3,Decent heat when sitting next to it,"This product produces good heat when you are within 1-2 feet of it. And I keep it at the lower setting(400W) and it's enough when it's next to me and I'm surfing the web(my room temperature is around 62 degrees from my normal central heating(water heat)). Have not tried to keep it on to heat the whole room but do not expect it to be able to since my room is about 12 feet by 12 feet. For a room like this, I probably need something in the 1500Watt range. This product is extremely light and portable which is probably it's biggest asset. Although the lasco space heater(1500W) has is only about half the size of this heater, and can probably warm up my whole room better."
5,Good cheap heat.,For the price you can't beat this heater. Since it has no fan i turn a ceiling fan on low to help spread the warmed air.
2,Quartz Portable Electric Heaters,I appreciate the reviews of the electric heaters but they would be inadequate for my needs. I have an Eden Pure 1000 watts Quartz Portable Electric Heater which does a very adequate job for a room that is a 17' X 17' room with 10' ceilings down to around 45 degrees. I have had it for several years but I was considering replacing it with an equal or better performing Quartz heater but the specs listed for any of the quartzheaters are quite confusing with quite a bit of monetary difference with no specific reason for that difference.Could you maybe review any larger Quartz and reduce the confusion of those heaters which look and sound alike but are considerably difference in price. Thanks.John Grimsley
3,heater,it works fine. no complaints so far. thank you. was expecting it to be a little larger but it works fine as a one room space heater.
4,Great heater,"I am quite happy with this heater, especially because it's soundless and no one can hear that i have it on."
4,Heat Without The Headache!,"I always struggle in my cold cold office in the summer, because I hate the way my space heater dries out the air and makes me feel like I'm suffocating. This offers radiant heat--no fan--and that apparently makes all the difference. It made my office toasty without me ever thinking about turning it off. Only complaint (mentioned by another reviewer already) is that you can't see the dial settings from the front. Stupid design flaw, but no biggie."
3,Heater Review,Best for small rooms. Must be patient. Takes a while to heat but does an OK job. Absolutely no noise. Really quiet.
1,BROKE WITH LITTLE USEAGE,Dead in 2 months. Waste of money.... I used it very sparingly and was shocked when it suddenly shut off mid use for no reason. It was so sudden I thought the fuse blew but it was the unit. Too bad....
1,quit after two months... where I can I return this junk?,"Thought it was good at first, but today, while on, it just stopped working. I've tried it in other outlets, checked everything. It's just dead and that's bad because I live in a motorhome in mountains with snow and it's cold outside. Plus, it's a 2-hr. drive to the nearest store... one way.To whom and where do I return this junk? Amazon won't take it after a month and I no longer have a box with info about it. I thought it was a great deal, but I guess you get what you pay for. I only bought it for the lower wattage use for my small space."
1,I'm sorry you asked.,"I bought 2 of these heaters because I've had one exactly like it for several years that works perfectly. These were ordered as gifts for friends. One works as well as my own, however (unfortunatly) the other one acted up from the start causing me much embarssment. I have sent it back for credit, and had I not been solicited for feedback I would have not said a thing bad as I believe this is a very good product and that I got the exception not the rule."
1,Fire Hazard Do Not Buy! Consumer Reports Wants Recall!!!!,Optimus Ceramic Heaters are unsafe. The safety switch that supose to turn the heater off when it tips over doesn't work!
2,What you see if what you get,This type of electric space heater is very dangerous because the case becomes extremely hot. I would not recommend this product.
1,Faint heat,"This unit heats its own case, but nothing much beyond 4'. I tried it in a small bathroom (8x10) and it had very little effect. Stick with heaters with fans."
2,"No so bad, no so good",It doesn't do the job. I am thinking about returning this item because is not useful. I cannot imagine when the real winter comes. I bought it because it have very good reviews but I just realize how different we are as humans (unless the optimus that I have is somehow different from the other ones).
2,I have returned it!,I have returned the heater well over a week ago and this is the first response I've had. I would like a full refund as the item was not up to my expectations.
2,Heater is not for me,This heater is probably best for a VERY small bedroom or a bathroom. The heat is only effective very close to it and it does get very hot so it is best not to allow small children or pets wander to close to it. I am returning it after trying it in my living room which is heated by a wood burning insert and in my bedroom which typically stays about 58-59 degrees...with the heater it was only warmed by a degree or two.
4,Works well but definitely a small heater for small rooms,The heat from this heater will not reach you if you are more than 20 feet away but it will reach you if you put it 8-10 feet away. I use it as a footwarmer on cold days. The design feels sturdy and I usually have it on 400 W when I'm just slightly cold. My only complaint is that I wish the bottom coil could be lit up instead of the top for the 400 W mode (instead of the top). Makes it a little less convenient of a foot warmer. Still a solid product nonetheless. I would still shell out a little more for the Optimus parabolic heaters but this comes in a close second.
2,Great while it worked,"I loved this heater because it was silent to use at work to heat up my cubicle. However, it only worked for two seasons, and then it just suddenly broke."
2,lead plug,"This small heater does throw out the heat but the off dial did not work. I would have ordered a replacement but as I unplugged it, I saw a warning notice on the back of the heater. This warning was not mentioned in the manual. The warning stated the plug had lead and you should wash hands after touching. That lead has been linked to birth defects and a cancer potential. For this reason I did not get a replacement. Amazon customer service was helpful and I had no problem returning the heater."
1,Consumer Reports-RECALLED 2011 version,"Out of 19 other heaters Consumer Reports tested this is the only one which FAILED. 1) failed the flammability test (cloth draped over heater caught fire, the unit is suppose have overheat and turn off. And other safety features didn't work.[...]"
2,Ok Heater,"I got this heater to sit under my desk as it is often cold where I work. The heat zone is very short but intense. The result is that the side of my body where the heater sits is very warm while the other side of my body is cool. I literally get goosebumps on one side while the other bakes. The heater is under my enclosed desk area but the whole area doesn't seem to get heated, just the spot right in front of it. One of the main features that attracted me to this heater was noise. It is very quiet but gives off a nice burning smell the first time you turn it on for the day. There is no thermostat so I turn it on and off manually. I will probably be returning this heater. I like the heating functionality of the blower heaters just not the noise but they work more effectively than this one does for my purposes."
1,it conked out after 5 months of use,"and costs more than i paid to return for repair. i didn't use it during summer, so have owned it 9 months."
1,Piece of Junk - Worthless Warranty,"This Optimus heater lasted a little over a year with infrequent use by my wife, then just stopped working (both burners simultaneously). Checked the ""3-year limited warranty"" and found that they may replace it with a refurbished unit if I ship it back to Optimus, and I pay shipping there and include a check for $20 for ""handling"" and shipping back to me. Let's see... That will cost at least as much as buying a new one, so completely worthless warranty. Moreover, it is a poor design to begin with. Not very stable and easy to tip over. Mostly cheap plastic. I still have an Edison quartz that is going on twenty years of heavy use and still works great. Optimus is bottom of the barrel."
3,Heater,Heater needs to turn on and off not stay on all the time unless you turn dial to off. Otherwise I like it
4,Good little heater,This heater is good for small areas. I like the option of 400 and 800 watts. Quartz elements get very hot which is great on cold days. Heater had safety switch on the bottom and will turn off if it tips over. Good value for the price.
2,Only useful for VERY small spaces,"Purchased this heater for my small office space and its still very cold. The only time I feel it is if I put it right under my desk, in which case it gets too hot. WILL NOT warm up your office or medium sized spaces. Maybe your bathroom or something."
4,Excellent Unit,"Just unpacked and turned it on. Seems to be an excellent heater that will save me a lot of money over the winter months as I turn down the house heat and just use the Optimus in my computer room. The only gripe (the reason why I removed one star) is that the warranty (with the exception of the Amazon 30-day return window) is somewhat bogus. I mean, after paying the cost of returning a defective unit and then a $15-20 fee for return shipping, I would be paying more than the cost of purchasing a new unit. So, I consider that there is no real warranty after 30 days. It's okay, as I expect it to be a reliable product."
4,Practical portable heater,"I purchased it last winter, and it has been working good. It works well for my small living room (around 300 sqf). It is recommended for a small place, room or just for your feet. Not for larger space. I am also happy that it doesn't affect my electricial bill too much. Good buy."
1,1 of Many Defects,I was one of many who had a defect... chinese quality control. It worked fairly well for the first few hours and suddenly died. Unplugged it and went to another wall and plugged it in. It worked for half an hour or so and tried the other half of the wall socket to get it started but it didn't work. Tried every socket in the room and still didn't work. Reason i went for this wasn't just the reviews but the optimus 9 inch dish that has lasted me 2 years and thousands of hours of use... Optimus H-4110 9-Inch Dish Heater. I am fortunate enough to have a $20 heater that has lasted me this long.
4,Good for small room,"No noise since there is no fan. Warms small room.Note that when used in night, it also acts as a night light since it will light the room.The control dial is awkward. It has two ""OFF"" positions in the full circle. From one ""OFF"" position, no matter which direction you turn, you will get to the ""800W"" mode. And from the other ""OFF"" position, no matter which direction you turn, you will get to the ""400W"" mode. This design has two problems:- If you switch between 400W and 800W from time to time, you will have to look at the dial to determine how many clicks you need to turn to get to the mode you want. And in night, you'll have to wait till it lights up to see which mode you turn it to.- If you are at the OFF position next to 400W, and want to turn to 800W, you'll have to turn two clicks away to pass the 400W. And vise versa.It's not a big deal but it is somehow very strange and counter-intuitive design."
4,Nice little heater,"This is a nice little heater, but it does get very very hot so be careful. It will not heat a room but is very good for warming your feet or legs quickly. The cord is a little bit short at 5 ft., I would have liked 8 ft., but it's not bad. Overall, it's a very simple and effective design."
3,Works fine,"Not a lot of heat, but works fine in small area. Would not recommend if area is bigger than 10 X 10"
4,hot hot hot,"Does the job it is meant to do. Be very careful because it gets ""red"" hot. Use with care around anything that can catch fire - cloths, cat's tails, etc."
1,useless,"I don't understand why this unit has so many good reviews. I set it to 800w and put it in a 15x6 bathroom. Both heat bars were glowing red, but when I checked two hours later, it was still chilly in the bathroom. With my hand two feet in front of the unit, I could barely feel any warmth. If you need heat, there is no point in plugging this thing in."
1,nice heater with a survivability of a mayfly,"Lasted about a week. Enough said. I liked this one because it is a low-power heater, even if you forget to switch it off, it will not break your budged."
2,"Heat is good, quiet, when it decides to work","I got 2 of these heaters a while back. They seemed cheap and great, and the only obvious problem was you have no idea what the settings on the dial do. They just say 400, 800 alternating all the way around, and switching it will make one or two come on...i don't know. My main problem is they dont have a reset switch or anything on them, but they will just shut off, i guess because they are too hot? They wont come back on when they are cooled off. They just randomly seem to start working again. I tried everything to make them come back on, unplugging, letting them sit, flipping the dials around...etc. Eventually one of them would ONLY work when i had 1 element lit up. Very frustrating to the point it was useless. Which is a shame because it definitely can heat a bedroom when its actually on and working with both elements."
2,Quiet with pretty good heat but POOR DESIGN,"I'm returning this heater because it is so poorly designed it drives me crazy -- the round knob has off plus 2 settings, and then just repeats the same settings on the other side of the knob... so you just keep turning and turning the knob. Have you ever in your LIFE seen a machine with a dial that says Off Low High Off Low High? It is insane. And it's on the side, so you literally have to lift the heater up and bring it up to your face in order to see if you're turning it on or off... Normally you'd just turn it all the way right or left to turn on/off, but since it's a never ending dial you have to look at it. Bizarre."
3,Not so energy efficient!!!,"We got two of these once we moved to a house from an apt (with free heat). After a month of using these our energy bill skyrocketed (used to be $40, now $88) and we decided to use our central heat more. Well gas bill increased by only $10-15 throughout the winter every month, so not sure if this is a worthy investment for someone *going green*."
2,ankle warmer heaters,"No complaint about the seller. However this heater is not worth the money, better off using a bic ligher to stay warm. But will keep them for the travel trailer"
2,"quiet, but lacks basic safety features","I purchased this heater because it received such high reviews from other Amazon customers. It is definitely quiet (virtually silent), and produces am amazing amount of heat. But the absence of a fan means that most of the heat stays in the immediate area, and that area (usually near me) gets too hot for comfort. There is no thermostat, so the heater just keeps blasting away until it's manually turned off. And the front of the unit gets very hot, so hot that I won't leave it on unless I'm in the room. It does have a cut-off switch on the bottom in case the unit gets tipped over, but no safety mechanism in case something (like a blanket) falls on it. I wish I had purchased a DeLonghi oil-filled radiator or a DeLonghi safe heat unit instead."
5,Great little heater !!,We love this heater. It is just the right size to keep our rabbit shed warm. Very efficient and low cost heat source too. I would recommend this to everyone!!!!!!!!!!
3,Heater,"I bought this heater because when we go visit my son in Denver, our room is always cold. I sent it to him and when we went for Thanksgiving, we slept nice and cozy.We could not leave it on all night because it gave too much light!"
3,"ok, not great","We purchased Optimus H5210 after reading many reviews of different room heaters. This had THE best reviews for heating a small room. Doesn't do it in our case. One has to sit at least 3 feet away to feel the warmth; after 5 hours the room is noticeably warmer, but that is only up to 58 degrees. This space is a sunroom, insulated but not heated, double paned windows. We had thought this would work, as we're in the southwest (not New England!)."
5,quiet perfect warmth,My computer desk is at my window where I there are drafts and when the central heating is cycled off I freeze.I also wanted something with low wattage to save on electric plus not have to worry about it tripping the circuit breaker. True I do not live in the frozen eastern parts of the country but it is still damp and cold here and this little heater makes me warm and toasty. In fact it warms up my entire room just fine.I am glad I did not listen to the bad reviews because I almost didn't buy it.No wonder the good reviews far outweigh the bad. This little heater at 400 watts packs a punch and the 800 watts makes it almost tropical.I don't think I could be happier or warmer.
1,Consumer Reports rates this a fire risk,"Consumer Reports tested numerous space heaters and this model was the only one to cause an outbreak of flames after a cloth was draped over it, simulating drapery or other fabric contacting the heater. The Optimus distributor says the product is improved for 2012 but CR purchased the tested model in the current year."
2,Shin-warmer,This heater really should be adjustable because if it's on the floor all it will heat is your shins. It also has to be about 1 ft away on low for you to feel anything and about 3 ft away on high. I like radiant heaters because they're quiet and they don't waste energy heating the air but I wish I had looked elsewhere and got a tower instead of this one.
2,You get what you pay for,"If you are wanting an infrared heater this is not it. This is not an infrared heater as the name implies. It is a small, quartz, radiant heater, and it does get very hot to the touch (infrared heaters do not get hot to touch). It will heat a very small area but has minimal output. Similarly priced heaters with fans from the box stores put out a lot more heat. The controls on this unit are impossible to read unless you get down own the floor. Regardless, for the price it is a decent unit, but I would not recommend it. I also ordered a Lasko ceramic heater that works like a dream and is well worth a few more dollars."
3,Space heater,I brought this to help with keep my house/room warm. I got this hoping it would work. It did work but it blew a fuse in my house. I have bad wiring and was hoping that it would not. I have a old heater that works but i wanted something more effentcant and still not blow a fuse. This product did blow a fuse but other than that seemed to work fine. I am sure on a house with regular wiring it would not be a problem. I did return it and received a refund. Did not like having to pay for the shipping twice and it was a lengthy process. Nothing really othan than that to complain about.
1,If you buy it - don't blame me,"I saw all the 4 & 5 stars but this is, in fact, a piece of China crap that can burn your house down.Me? no expert but Consumer Reports is. AFTER (and I mean a day after) I bought this they came out and said it has no over-heating device to shut it off and they were going to the cunsumner protection to have them pull these things. THEY SAY don't buy it and if you have it STOP USING IT AND THROW IT OUT.Google it. So, if a curtain lands on it or a tie or a 'thing' is too close, it won't shut off until the house burns down.Realy, the electric will go before the house. But it will not shut off if it overheats - nice option for a heater. Oh, it will heat all right.So, I turned it on and it takes forever to get you warm - it's a loser of a product. If you buy it, don't blame me."
2,Very Weak heater,"Heater warms area only a few inches around the front. Even if kept on all night long, it will not warm up a small room. Price is decent, but I would suggest finding a different heater that can warm a greater circumference around."
1,"Hot to touch, Extremely Hazardous","The item description online is very misleading as it claims a ""Cool-touch housing"", when in reality the housing is a burn hazard and must be kept away from children and pets (or clumsy adults)."
2,Best for a smaller room.,"My daughter has one of these in her (small) guest bedroom, and I was so impressed I bought one for myself. But my BR is 2x the size of hers, and it didn't do the trick. But it's quiet and efficient."
5,Great!!,"This solved the problem of tripping the circuit breaker. My roommate and I each got one and it's definitely good enough to heat our little rooms. And they are really only good for usage in smaller areas - when I bring it into the living room, it just really keeps my feet warm. But for the purposes in which I got this, which was for my room, it is great and energy-efficient."
3,Good for a small room,Gets very hot. Works well for small rooms or to keep feet warm. Nice for the money. Works great in my home or to keep bathroom warm while I shower in the winter it gets cold in there.
4,Nice personal heater!,"I just purchased my second Optimus H-5210 this fall. I have over a year of use on my first one and it is still going strong. With its safety features (tipover shutoff) and quiet operation, I have found it to be perfect for personal heating in my somewhat drafty office. I have one right under my desk at work, and a second one at home in the den. The radiant heat output is very nice, and these units are very energy efficient for the comfort that they provide. Only negative is the odd smell when the unit is first turned on."
4,"Good heater, bad warranty*","The warranty is for 3 years, but there's a catch* to pay for shipping to send it to the company that manufactures it PLUS send a $15 check to have it returned shipping!! SCAM. After 2-3 years, you pay shipping and send $20 for returned shipping to you. So, let's say there really is NO warranty. Do not be fooled. But on the upside, it seems to work well. Just got it, so we'll report back after 30 days. You get what you pay for!"
3,Works fine,It works well for a small heater. It is a little bright at night if you leave it in your room.
4,Toasty Toes,"Got this to use mainly for our feet and lower legs while reading. Seems to work fine--haven't used it too much yet--winter is just starting up in northern Florida. We figure this will keep us from having to bump up the central heat in the whole house. Quiet and lightweight. The cats aren't freaked out by it. If needed, I will provide an update after I use it for the season."
5,Highly rated by my cat!,"I actually purchased this heater because my cat likes to sit in front of it on cold nights. This is not a high wattage heater, which is one of the things I like about it. Wattage options are 400 and 800. Radiant heaters are good at warming the object (person or cat) sitting in front of it, but they do not heat a room. Ironically, I purchased this heater after I read that it was rated unacceptable by Consumer Reports. I believe they stated something to the fact that it would start cloth on fire if it had direct contact with the heater. Apparently, you should now be able to lay combustible material against an electric heater without adverse consequences so if you are inclined to do this, do not purchase this heater! But if you are a freer spirit and don't feel that you should constantly be protected from yourself, I highly recommend this unit."
2,Contact the merchant first!,"This item is misleading. At least it misled me. It made me believe the heating rods were metal and so I was happy to make the purchase. However, when you get it you will realize the heating rods are not metal. They are fluorescent, which means they will not last for long. At least that is my experience. So unless you want fluorescent rods, you will be disappointed. Thought I share this for anyone who was looking for metal rods like myself."
1,Broke in 2 months,"See title. Little usage, one day just stopped working. It was so sudden and for no reason i thought the fuse blew, but alas, it just broke. JUNK!"
3,its good but...,Item arrived sooner than promised. it works well for a small room. it also sucks power like crazy. so you have to weigh in the cost of using this(electricity bill) against turning up the heat(gas bill). you will need to find a sweet spot between those two and probably limit the usage accordingly.
3,Product Power Reqirement,"Just bought the Infrared radiant heater, only to discover the power reqirement of the product is not same for Nigeria. I need to get a step down tranformer (220v to 120v) before i can use it. I hope it works out well at the end."
4,heater,Nice enough for the price. Haven't used it much but have high hopes for it. I like the easy temp setting dial.
3,Stand in front of it,"stand in front of this heater, you'll feel yourself toasty warm, a foot away you're back in Siberia. Nice and quiet tho.I bought a fan forced Lasko and ordered 2 of these, thank goodness Amazon only sent one because 2 woujld have been a real waste.I cant stand the racket a fan forced heater makes, am not rich,wear 2 pair socks and double sweaters, the cats are living under blankets unless its meal time, so its bloody cold here. I'm at wits end at what other options there are, other than run the landlords electric furnace and get another $200 bill next month and that is not an option.Yes I know I could bubble wrap the windows, but this house is old and I'm nervous about not having some fresh oxygen flow. Segue to the windows, they seem to sag and need checking every few days. I find they slip, need to be pushed back into position and relocked.Other than moving, something I cant physically handle after just moving in May, any suggestions would be appreciated."
4,It works well,"The heater came on time and in perfect condition. It is extremely quiet but it gets very hot. Even the wire mesh on the front side is very hot. I would not recommend it if you have little kids at home. Other than that I think it works better than my other space heater, as I do feel my room gets warmer with it. However, I am not sure if it does save energy, because it is on continuously and it uses 400W at low and 800W at high setting. My other regular heater turns on and off intermittently. I would think that it would save the energy while it is blowing hot air. All in all, I think it is a good buy."
3,Consumer Reports,Was considering this heater until I checked heater reviews on the consumer reports websiteThis one is a fire hazard.As long as you are aware of that I suppose you can use it safely enoughThe sensor on this heater is SUPPOSE to shut it off before it overheats but in their tests it did not.
1,Up and Quit After 4 Months,"Good little heater for the money, but don't expect any more than one winter season out of it. Began using it every night for approx. 9 hours per nightfor about three months, and then it just died. It heated well and the energy useage was low and affordable, however. Just don't expect to get a lot of time out of it."
4,its good,"The heater is good, worth of money........ but when it runs at 400 watts, it always illuminates only upper lamp....... thats a draw back......"
4,Excellent and quiet personal heater,"Virtually all ""space heaters"" on the market run a fan while they are on, which creates a droning background noise in a small quiet office environment. This model has no fan, so it is absolutely silent. Plus, this model generates a sufficient amount of personal comfort (even in a room where the main heat is set to 62 degrees) at one of its 2 energy-saving wattage settings: 400 watts or 800 watts. Most space heaters run at (and require) 1200-1600 watts. Plus, the price ($26.75 delivered, via Amazon) makes this a no-brainer. Don't expect this heater to warm up a whole room, that's not what it is for. It does make a great personal heater (and a quiet one at that), and will save on your overall heating bill."
4,Good heater,"This is a good heater. It is great for the garage where you don't want to heat the entire air space. It warms like the sun, so if you stand next to it you definitely feel heat. Works as described.I only wish for 2 things:1. A thermostat.2. It could be built out of nicer plastic. This plastic feels like if you drop it it WILL break. I do not know this for sure, but I am not going to test it if I can help it."
3,One major problem,"The heater itself has been real decent. Have had this under my desk at work for some time and it really gets the room (14 x 14) fairly warm inside a half hour. The dangerous thing I have noticed is that one of the OFF buttons actually leaves one of the heat lamps on. I know this sounds crazy, but I have left this OFF for a half hour and the coil is still red hot and on. Very dangerous. Going to return with the hope of getting one that doesnt have this problem.EDIT 3/22/10 - Thing is pretty much dead. Its going in the trash heap now. I never returned it as I said it would but it basically lasted one winter season."
2,Potential Safety Risk You Should Know About-Consumer Reports,"In the November 2012 Consumer Reports, this heater is cited as a safety risk. They state it was the only heater in their tests of 19 models that set clothes on fire.When Consumer Reports contacted Optimus, they were told the company fixed the problems for 2012 models. I bought this in 2009 from Amazon and the date on the back is July 2008, so not sure what model would be shipped to you if you purchase it here.Consumer Reports states they are asking the Consumer Product Safety Commission to recall this model and state that if you already own it, to stop using and ask the retailer for a refund."
1,Died in less than one year,I bought this heater in March 2012 and it died in December. I only used it through April and then in the months of Oct - Dec. The heater went out.
5,Good Value for Money,Very good little heater for what it is. Heats a bedroom really well. Would recommend it to anyone that just wants to heat a small area.
5,great space heater,"have 2 sets of heating, keep the living room nice and warm, and my pets enjoy it.Only thing I dont care for it has a small dent on it. but it is a used one tho"
3,Its OK.,"Range is not great, but its small and quiet. I expected radiation to have more affect and warm surrounding air."
2,Works well for a little while.,"I've purchased two of these over the past two years, because I really liked the infrared heat when working - I put it next to my desk in my small office. However, neither lasted a full season. They were inexpensive enough not to get too upset about it, but now that the price is higher I guess I won't be getting a third. And no, there is no way to get money back once it's not working."
4,Good for small rooms,"I have used this heater for two winters now. It works well for a small closed room in an apartment building. Or if you want directional (close) heat. The only plus side to this heater is that it uses half the energy as most. This has two settings 400W and 800W. Most other heaters are 1500W. This does have a safety shut-off if it is knocked over. I will probably upgrade to a larger heater for my living room this year, and use this one for my bedroom."
4,Quartz Heater,"This heater puts out a really hot, instant heat. It reminds you a bitof a sunlamp, intense direct heat. It is great for ""spot"" heating butis not meant to heat up a room, as it heats objects and not air.This product does what it was intended to do and is an excellent preformerand not all that bad on the electric bill."
4,Great littel heater for the price!,"SUPER quiet, almost totally silent. This little guy puts out a good amount of heat. It also weighs next to nothing so it is easy to move and there is a good handle on the back near the top so it is easy to pick up and re-position. There is a spring switch on the bottom that shuts it off if it gets knocked over. GREAT value for the price. I will probably buy 2 or 3 more for other rooms in the house.Update Feb 2011: I've had this great little heater for over a year now and still love it. Highly recommend!"
4,Nice heater for the price.,"I have two of these and they heat up the room quite nicely. A little bit of a plastic smell when they first heat up out of the box, but that goes away after a while and now I notice no odor. The one in my bathroom is older and tends to overheat with both coils on since the room is so small so I just keep that one on one coil."
3,Not a room heater,"I can't believe there are 280 plus five star reviews. This hardly puts out that much heat. I had it in my 10 x 10 office and couldn't tell if it was on even at 800 watts. The temp outside is currently low 40s. It is a bit flimsy so don't kick it. It looks ok and is a nice compact size. It has a nice big dial but it's on the side and you have to bend down to see if you turned it off or what setting you set. Of course it doesn't make any noise as it doesn't have a fan or other moving parts. No smell either even the first time used.Now it may work in a room at night when you are sleeping and the furnace is turned down to 60 and you want to ""take the chill off"" but I'd recommend a thicker blanket. Think of it this way, 400 watts = 4 100 watt incandescent light bulbs. Actually the light bulbs might put more heat... I was hoping to save some money and noise over my 1500 watt heater with a fan but that ain't going to be..."
5,Love this light weight heater - works great!!,"This heater works very well. I was warm at 400w , and the heater warms up very very quickly, it is light weight and easy to move around the house. I use it to keep my feet warm on those really cold days. it is very quiet and what a great price!!! I am going to get two more -- another one as a spare ...and one for a friend of mine who keeps trying to take it when she visits me ... good buy & works well."
2,Radient Heater,"While it performed exactly as advertised, the fact that it had no fan to better circulate the heated air had it heating only a small area. Fine for a small, confined space, but not recom,mended for general room or area heatine."
4,FOR GAS RELIEF!,"This Optimus heater is exactly what I needed for relief from my extremely high gas heat bills. Since it is only 110v the usage of electricity is very little. I have used it on many cool fall nights since I have recieved it. It is quiet, light and the warmth is more than enough. I am using 3 space heaters this winter, I refuse to turn on the money sucking gas heat. Unless you are one of the lucky few who are financially able to heat your resident with gas. I recommend you use this Optimus and other 110v heaters to slam the door on high gas heat bills. This is located in my bedroom, another in the living room and a spare for use where ever I want it. ELIMINATE YOUR EXTREMELY HIGH GAS BILL WITH 110V SPACE HEATERS!"
2,No thermostat it is either on or off with only two settings.,Firstly I thought it was free shipping by buying it directly from Amazon - It cost an extra $10 shipping. I could have bought it for about $30 which included shipping but must have misread the Amazon ad and paid about $40 - That was the start -I also thought that the heat had a thermostat - It doesn't you are either on or off with only 2 setting.Not a happy camper with this deal.
3,This heater,"The good side is that it doesn't make any sound, and it consumes relatively little energy. The downside is that there's no wind, so it's hard to get the heater at the right distance from you: you want to get warm, but you don't want to get sizzled either! But that's the nature of the Radiant heater, isn't it. The other cautionary point is that: in practice you can only use the low setting (400W), because the high setting (800W) heats up the appliance too much that it automatically turns itself off in a while (~10min)."
5,Just what I was looking for,I was looking for a space heater without a fan and decided to try the Optimus H-5210.I like that it does not take up to much space and it is very easy to use.I have not had any problems with it and would buy another one if I needed another space heater.
2,Missing alot of scenes...,"I bought this for the full movie I don't care about the second movie, if the first movie is missing all the best scenes. I read in other reviews, this version isn't the extended version that used to play on TV. How does such a old movie have extended scenes. I feel ripped off, bad buy. Look further for the extended version, don't get screwed like I did."
4,very funny,What can be said about Jim Carry? This movie is a oldy but a goodie. You need both movies because they are both are worth watching. This man knows how to make someone laugh.
2,"Might be fun for kids, not so much for adults","I always had the curiosity of checking this out. I just wish I had seen it when I was a kid rather than now. Quite honestly, I just think this was stupid as hell."
5,This looke like a job for PET DETECTIVE,"I have always been a fan of jim Carrey and i believe this is Jim Carreys best picture. Ace ventura is a Pet Detective who undergoes two very important cases, The kidnapping of the mascott of the Miami Dolphins and a disaperance of the great white bat. These two movies will keep you laffing for a long time."
1,didn't receive right movie,I ordered Ace Ventura (Pet Detective /When Nature Calls). Instead I received a completely different movie (Four Brothers - R rated). It was supposed to be a gift for Christmas and I was very happy it arrived a few days before as promised. But doesn't do me any good if it isn't the right movie.
3,WHICH version of the first film?,"I am only giving it 3 stars because there is important information missing from the description of this release. Is this new DVD going to have the extended version of the 1st movie, as is shown regularly on tv, OR is it the theatrical version? I would like the extended version. Amazon doesn't say. They also don't say whether the 1st movie is in widescreen or not. Up to now, there is only a pan-and-scan version on DVD."
4,very good,"I love Jim Carrey, the combo is good, the picture looks great. just that i buy it because it said it was in Spanish and it turned out that only has Spanish subtitles"
4,hilarious classic carey comedy,"if you like the physical comedy Jim Carey produces, then this is what you're looking for. the scene where he's bouncing around in the white jeep continuously is classic."
4,Ace Ventura Double Feature,Good Clean Entertainment. Jim Carrey at his best. Ace Ventura has a big heart and is a fun character to watch. Animals add a giggle to the movie and the movie plots are easy to follow. Great movies to watch with whole family.
4,Very nice but could be better....,"Ok, first off, yes they made the first movie Widescreen finaly and they redid the transfers to make them look much better. The sound is improved as well with 5.1 on the first movie.However, why did they delete the dolphin trainer bit where he talks to the reporters. I mean WTF....Also, they should have made the first one an extended version like was on TV once. On TV they showed a version that had 4 or 5 new scenes added and they were great.Even though it could have been better it was still worth the money for this set which now looks great on my bigscreen HD TV. The old version looked pretty bad compared to today's standard dvds."
4,Great Films,"The best part is, that these films are now the correct format (widescreen) and have a dolby DTS soundtrack. The unfortunate part is they are the director's cut, which in this case is a few minutes shorter. Now while I didn't notice the parts cut out, it would be nice to have a double pack that is in the original release format. The other option is to spend 50% more or so and buy them individually, and I don't believe they have DTS/proper widescreen.Anyhow, they are great quality, they make you laugh, and it's a good price. Honestly the cut out screens didn't affect me (who takes Ace Ventura films for their cinematic quality anyways), I just wanted to laugh."
4,cant beat jim carrey,"this double feature is very funny,i watch these movies alot. jim carrey is perfect for these movies."
1,Waited this long for Widescreen and No FULL Extended Version,"Unbelievable. I mean come on, we're only talkin about a few minutes here. Missing some of the funniest scenes in the 1st movie including the German Jacque Cousteau character scene. I didnt even know the laserdisc version was an 'extended' version until now. Thank god I still have the laserdisc.Another incident of movie companies raping the public. Grrrrrh..."
2,Simple bag,I thought this would be a great purchase buy upon receiving it I realized that is does not include a divider to protect the scope from other pieces. In the literature they speak of an optional divider and straps but am not sure where to find that instead.
5,Must have accessory,I can't imagine trying to move around this substantial telescope without a cushioned case that has the strap offset to balance the load. It is well made and I couldn't live without it.
4,Nice Bag,"I like the bag very much as we travel and plan to take the scope with us on camping trips. The bag also provides a protective container to keep the scope in at home. I wish the bag had some pockets for storing eyepieces, the finder scope and various tools, red flashlight, etc. I solved that problem by purchasing some inexpensive all-purpose zipper bags from the stationary department of a local superstore ($2.97ea). I bought bright colors so they would be easier to see in the dark. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase."
3,"nicely made, but doesn't fit base","I just received this in the mail, so I haven't been able to use it and put it to the test yet. It seems fine, well made, and sturdy. However, I thought it would fit the entire scope, including base. It doesn't. It's mean to fit the tube assembly, not the base. I'll keep it; it looks like it will work really well for transporting the scope. However, I plan to keep the tube mounted on the base at home, and the bag won't fit that. So the bag goes in the closet for now."
5,"Beautiful review, photos",It isn't strong on descriptions but it is a lovely coffee table book and brings back pleasant memories of our travel there (honeymoon). I recommend the book and the trip to everyone.
5,Must-have for Joe Pass fans,"Joe Pass was one of the finest guitarsts to ever live. I got to see him perform once in a very small club shortly before he passed. There were only about 15 people in attendance. It was clear that he was not pleased with the turn out, but still put on an amazing show.This video gives us a chance to see him perform in various settings (solo, and with a band). It spans most of his career. There is even a segment where he is playing a Fender Jaguar guitar - something I had never seen him do. The recording quality is not always good, but thats understandable considering the age of the recordings.If you are a fan of Joe Pass, or just a fan of amazing jazz guitar playing, this is a must-have video.Enjoy!"
1,Do Not Buy These Levers,"I just bought 2 pair of these, thinking they were the ones pictured. They are not. They are not the old red-dot style, these have a cheap hinge clamp and best of all, mine did not include ANY CABLE STOPS AT ALL. These levers are of no use at all unless I go out and buy more hardware to make them work. Very disappointed. As an earlier reviewer noted, head over to Velo Orange and get their city levers, which are cool looking, work well, and cost about the same if not a little less. Amazon gets an F on this one."
1,NOT THE ITEM PICTURED!,"These are the not the pictured item. These are by all accounts the Dia-Compe 133, the bottom of the barrel in their city lever line. They are not the ""Red Dot"" style with band clamps which are pictured. They do not even fall into Dia-Compe's TOURING line!I didn't even think to check the reviews, who the hell gives 3 and 4 stars for not getting the product they ordered!!The hinge style clamps are cheap looking, and the new DIA-COMPE stamping on the smaller body make these almost look like even cheaper steel levers. The new design is just not worthy of being purchased. They lost the vintage-y feel and downgraded the mounting style. Add to this that they just raised the price, and the ""Velo Orange City Levers"" ASIN: B004JKIPYA are a MUCH better deal at this price point."
3,Not the same as the picture,The levers I received are not the same ones as pictured. They look ok but I really wanted the vintage look that was shown in the product picture. Also they come with a hinge clamp instead of a band clamp as shown.
2,Organize Your Business Travel : Simple Routines for Managing,Geared for the traveler who is beginning to travel on business. Much of the information here is not enlightening to the seasoned business traveler. More common sense than breakthrough information.
4,Works just fine,"Got this safe about a month ago. Works just fine. It's not too heavy, small and easy to transport if needed."
5,Perfect Parents,"Not so perfect parents in a perfect movie. While some might say a lot happens to these people that might seem over the top, everything comes together at the end. The no-subtitles does make it a little difficult to sometimes understand the accents, but over all the movie is easy to follow, if not an easy subject."
3,Omnivore - One Giant Leap,"Some good, if ultimately unremarkable, techno, back from what prog house was slowly taking over the world. You can hear some prog house elements lurking in ""My Wiggly Tale,"" even if the track eventually overcomes them. As well, ""Meteorology"" has a nice timpani break at the 2/3rds point, but it's not that compelling overall. ""Face the Future,"" with its darker bobble, holds more interest, and ""Big Trouble in Deep Space"" continues with a dark throb. The last track, ""Over and Out"" adds some quasi-ethnic percussion to liven things, but the standout track leaves behind house altogether: it's the slower chug of ""King of the Bouncy Castle."""
4,"Not perfect, but I have no complaints","This fan is easy to put together, very quiet on low speed, and powerful on high speed. It makes some funny squeaks occasionally when it is oscillating, but it's not too annoying (and that may just be mine). I am satisfied with my purchase."
2,don't Buy!,"All the bad reviews about this fan are accurate. Not quiet, cover to hold on blades does not fit, and cheap."
3,Not a bad choice,"I bought this fan for use in my bedroom, which unfortunately does not have an AC. Really strong, but very noisy. I leave it on the lowest setting to make the noise level tolerable. Assembly wasn't too difficult, although you may need a thin philips screwdriver.Overall, not a bad choice for a cheap fan, but you might find less noisier options elsewhere"
1,don't buy from this seller,received product that was defective. box had several shipping labels -- amazing it made it to me. Clearly the product had been all over the country so no wonder the unit did not mount firmly on stand. seller does not reply to phone calls and emails. beware of this seller!!!!!!
5,Very dependable fan,"I purchased two of these fans for my husband's studio. They join two other Holmes fans which he uses to keep the air moving, not only for personal comfort and to make the a/c more efficient, but also to help paint on his canvases dry faster. On all fronts, they perform just fine. The fans are steady and stable, they run for hours on end without overheating the motor, the other Holmes fans we own have lasted for years and keep on going, and they keep the air moving very efficiently with very little maintenance (only cleaning the blades every now and then). Both the process of assembling them and the process of running and maintaining them is simple and intuitive. They are not completely silent--especially when you have several of them running at once--there is a slight hum which is probably unavoidable and, actually, quite nice."
5,Great performance and durability,Great product! Works very well and is not that noisy so it's easy to sleep with it on. It also survived a kick from a disgruntled boyfriend and still works exactly the same.
1,Do get fool,"Hi every body don't get fool by cheap price,when they say its real diamonds on the Hearts Bracelet.Because if it was it wouldn't be for twenty nine dollars and some cents.I use too work for a Jewelry company.Those probably or crystal or diamond accent. It two total different things."
4,Good product...,"I thought the bracelet was very nice. It arrived before it was expected to, which was a bonus. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that the picture was a little mis-leading. I thought that the links between the hearts had diamonds all along the band, not just a little one in the middle."
3,Not what I expected...,"It's ok, but looks a little cheap (even though it is) and it's too big and heavy for what I was looking for. I do not believe this costs $124.00 as retail price. The diamonds are not even noticeable and do not shine at all."
1,Bracelet,"I was not happy at all with this product. It does not look at all like the picture. It doesnt sparkle at all (I do not even see any diamonds on it). The clasp does not close all the way, which makes the bracelet fall off.I was not satisfied at all, I would have never paid $50 for it if I saw it at a store. I emailed the company and never recieved a response back. I ended up returning the item, I just hope I do not have issues with them returning my money.Not only that but the delivery of the product took forever. I got it a few days before Christmas. Since it was a gift it would have been nice to get it earlier, but since I didn't I had to run out on Christmas Eve to get that person another gift."
3,Good Read,"This was the first in the ballad series by Sharon McCrumb, and I ended up reading this after I had read all the others. This was not the best of the series, but I did still enjoy it. As I have said in other reviews, to read a Sharon McCrumb ballad novel is to fall in love with the characters, the setting, and their story. This one gave me a little better insight into the man, Spencer Arrowwood, who is the sheriff and who I fell in love with in the other books. I suggest reading the ballads in order, but it is not necessary. But if you get started, be prepared to want to read them all!"
3,"An obvious culprit, but worth the time.","As a mystery, ""Peggy-O"" falls a trifle short; there simply aren't that many possibilities for the killer. But as a study of present-day Appalachian life, it's superb. The characters are compelling, their worries, aspirations etc. expertly handled. McCrumb obviously has tremendous pride in being of the region and it shows. Richly detailed and executed."
3,Good book but left me with many questions.,I wanted to know why the sheriff didn't turn in Muryan. How does this related with the killings we have today by young school aged people. It seems that the author touched on murder by students without giving any suggestions to help this problem. I had a problem with reading the letters from Travis. It seems like I couldn't read them through. I had to stop and try to keep myself from going too much into the feeling he was having while serving in Vietnam. They were very powerful letters. Are they real letters or did the author just make them up from a collection of real Vietnam experience letters.
1,A disappointing McCrumb novel,"What is usually a morally sound book took a nosedive for the trash can. I didn't appreciate the inside scoop on officer Atwood's wildly running hormones as he interviewed a teenage girl. That was totally out of character. And why the one night fling between LeDonne and Martha? What point did that prove? Also, we were privy to an adolescent's sexual fantasies, that stupid kid at the end. Come on McCrumb, step up out of the gutter."
1,NOT VERY GOOD!!!,"I was very disappointed in this book. This is the first one on McCrumb's books I have read but had heard they were real good. I found my self not wanting to put the book down, not because I was enjoying it but because I just wanted to get done with it. Sheriff Spencer Arrowood is a Sheriff in a small town. First a dog is killed, then a sheep and then a girl. We are led to believe a Vet. no one has heard from in 20 years is the killer. Peggy Muryan, a 60""s folk singer is supposed to be the final target. No one solves the crime until the killer shows up. A lot of the book is spent planning a class reunion. I may try one of the MacPherson books but think I am done with the Ballard books. I know different people like different things but this is just not for me. If you have another author you enjoy I would read it and skip this."
3,"Good characterizations, poor mystery","While the writing was smooth and the characters engrossing, the ""mystery"" at the center was somewhat flimsy. The whodunnit was clear from the very beginning, for our murderer serves no other role in the story so his very presence makes his guilt clear. It's always annoying to the reader when s/he spends the novel waiting for the characters to catch up. That said, the folks of Appalachia that McCrumb introduces us to are well worth meeting, and well worth following in later books in the series, which, I am happy to say, not only rely less on the mystery as plot device, but also devise better mysteries."
5,I Returned for a Second Read,"Have you ever attended a high school reunion? Do you remember when the horror of the war in Viet Nam was in our living rooms every night? The first time I read this book was about 12 years ago. That time I was reading a 'whodunit' set in the mountains of east Tennessee. I just wanted to find out who was the murderer. When I reread ""If Ever I Return Pretty Peggy-O"" this fall, I was able to enjoy the author's multiple layers of context and discovered a piece of literature. Sharyn McCrumb is not just a formula mystery writer; her characters are real, and the contrast between the beauty of the mountain setting and hurting victims in the story give the reader a feeling of being inside the pages with the characters, a close spectator. And Vernon Woolwine is iconic."
4,Pretty Impressed,"I was pretty impressed with this book. I am planning on reading all of the ""Ballad's Novels"" and I know this is the first, so as I read it, I cut the author a little slack (being this was her first). I did enjoy the story and the suspense. And I found the characters loveable. I'd give it a try if I were you!"
2,Boring,"The book was disappointing. I expected a better read from this author. Overall, the book is boring. Stick to Michael Connelly, Lee Child, Robert Crais, and John Hart. Far better writers."
4,A good book,"You should read this book after you have had an understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The book is about using existing constructions and structures in such a generic way, that allows you to take advantage of them, no matter what kind of data type is being used. Easy to read and conclusive."
2,Disappointed,"I expected something different with this book. It depends on what you're looking for. I love the cottage look and feel in a home, but this was not really my definition of 'cottage.' When I think of coastal cottages, I think light, bright, airy and made up of furnishings that look like they've been collected over time. I think painted finishes and an inviting atmosphere that beckons you to just put your feet up, sit back and relax. I wasn't impressed with the way the rooms were photographed and it just didn't inspire me."
3,Just housing no socket included,Received the order yesterday in white but was surprised to find no socket included with the purchase. I had to get back online to order the sockets. The renovation project is now delayed waiting for remaining parts to arrive. The light housing looks good though and nice quality.
2,This book didn't give good instructions for projects.,This book isn't what I expected.It really gave no instructions on how to do experiments.I can't find the source listed for one experiment.We got the book to give my daughter ideas on science projects:it wasn't much help.
5,1001 Good Ideas,"This book is both informative and useful, though it does not specifically lay out the exact steps needed for performing each experiment. It is great for finding ideas from which one can generate his or her own purposes. You should realize that the projects explained in the book do not all involve a specific variable that is changed for the experiment. Instead, topcis are open ended , and can be modified to make a dependent variable. I, as a top eigth grade student who went to regionals for the science fair last year, recommend this book, even if it might not give you a topic for a science fair project: IT IS GOOD READING."
3,I've Read This Before,This book is well written and covers everything {coventional} you need to know about controlling anxiety. The only thing I would complain about is that there's really nothing in this book that hasn't been written before; therefore I don't reccomend this book to anyone looking for unconventional or natural cures for anxiety.
4,My son loves this book!,My son is 7 and I was not sure what he would think of this book. He loves it. I was very surprised by his reaction to the book. I skimmed the book and felt that it was appropriate for any age boy with good reading skills.
4,"Unfortunately, today ""common sense"" has become nonsense to a grunge-influenced culture","Detractors will argue that a book like this is only common sense, but unfortunately, our society today has been influenced by the ""grunge-activists"" so that good manners in word and deed are disappearing. Bridges and Curtis touch on such mundanely topics as shaking hands with the elderly, with ladies, etc., writing (a lost art) of thank you notes, giving and receiving compliments, opening doors for others, answering a phone (and cell phone usage), table manners, making introductions, etc. These and all are essential in the business and professional world.Good manners in what one says and does is always appropriate: putting others before oneself. While there will certainly be variations, the untaught and unsure cannot go wrong by going by their ""letter of the law."" jhr"
3,j.v.,the book is for a little kid it is about every thing that you should already know and im only on chapter 20
3,Liked it but get it from the library.,There was nothing wrong with the book but I wish I would have just gotten this one from the library. It was a waste of money for what was inside. Large print and binding to make it seem like there is going to be a lot inside but there wasn't. Again liked it but get it from the library.
5,"Yes, We Need More Gentlemen!","In a time when the art of being a gentleman has been long lost, this refreshing book can help a new generation learn the knack of simple courtesy. Excellent material for 13-year-old boys up through retired men, everyone can benefit. Buy one for your son, boyfriend, husband, grandfather, father-in-law, or ""ex"" -- start a ""courtesy revolution"" in your family. Worth every penny and more."
3,Great Book...for Believers only.,"I bought this book back in 2007. This is a very well written and interesting book to read. However this is a book for believers only. Why ? Because this is basically a bunch of supposed Bigfoot sightings and nothing else. No serious investigations, just a bunch of stories ( a lot of them are not very credible in my opinion ). This book is fun to read, yes, but if you don't believe Bigfoot exist then you won't enjoy reading this book. The authors believes 100% that the Bigfoot phenomenon is real and they seems to think that all the supposed Bigfoot sightings are real and legit, this can be really annoying sometimes. But it's a good read."
3,Garant YP139EAKD Yukon Aluminum Snow Shovel,"Good basic design. Size of shovel head ideal for shoveling,as opposed to pushing snow. I would prefer the shovel head to be made from a somewhat ""heavier duty"" grade of plastic."
5,Garant 13 7/8-inch Great shovel - should be 10 stars,"This is a great shovel for Seniors. Its light weight, and makes lifting heavy snow easier than using a wide shovel. We have had plenty of snow this year to give it a work out."
2,Poor Plastic,"I had a shovel break on me a couple of days before a big storm was due in Feb of 2011. None of the local stores had anything left in stock so I resorted to Amazon.The design on this is the only thing that saves it from 1 star for me. The handle is a good shape, the blade is smaller but it's intended for shoveling not pushing so that is fine.The problem is in the materials. After one use the plastic at the base of the blade was already fraying. After 4 uses the base of the blade was very erratic from the plastic that shaved off. After 6 uses it had a small crack in the blade near the base of the handle. It got me through the rest of the winter but I bought a new shovel prior to winter 2012."
4,Texas Flyer,"This may be the best DVD that features Freddie King yet released in terms of over all song content. Featuring footage from the Sugarbowl concert and also bonus footage from an LA recording session. The LA footage is available on the CD ""Key to the Highway"" although the audio is poor on the CD it is better on the DVD. Look for his European concert DVD released later this year. Track list: Sugarbowl concert; Big Legged Woman, Aint Nobodys Business, Tore Down, Key to the Highway, Boogie Chillin, Have you Ever Loved a Woman, Goin Down, LA concert; Have You Ever Loved a Woman, Look over Yonders Wall, Aint Nobodys Business, Whole Lotta Lovin."
5,A Lost Classic,"A great album by a great band and packed full of great songs. Webb is the finest bassist I've ever heard, McGeoch was a true genius on guitar and Jobson was perhaps the least understood and most under-rated songwriter of his time.The original album had a track on it called 'Jungle Of Cities', but it's exclusion is no great loss as it was the only weak(ish) track. (They had a couple of tracks which appeared as B-sides which were much better and would have fitted nicely onto this album instead. Check out 'The Innocents Abroad' & 'Is It A Wonder'if you can.) The album version of 'Castles In Spain' is good, but unfortunately not quite in the same class as the original single version. Other than that, it's fantastic. Songs like 'Higher Than The World', 'Avalanche' and particularly 'Waiting For The Floods' are absolute classics. This is an album that everyone should own.By the way... The track ""we are brave again"" is actually called 'We Can Be Brave Again'. Cheers."
4,This book is good for all dog-lovers.,"An excellent book. Certainly superior from other dog training books in the market. It porvides detailed techniques and alternatives to training your dog. Also included are nutritional facts.However, I, as the owner of a dog myself, find that some of it's techniques are unsuitable for certain dogs. This book is good for certain types of dogs, ie Labrador, Alsation, Bull Mastiff. However for Poodles, Great Danes, I find this book un effective."
5,Awesome Book!!,This is a great book. It is about a girl who's whole family has died but her. She has to go live with her cousin she does not like. She has to leave all her friend and her memories behind.
4,The Pledge,"The Girl Death Left Behind is a book about teachings of bravery and strength. This novel teaches you not to take anything for granted. You might love what you have and not really notice it unitl it's gone. I suggest if you care for something or someone, show it, let everyone know you care, and do not take anything you love for granted.The Girl Death Left Behind definitely teaches readers to care about and accept what we have in life!"
5,Best Book of Lurlene McDaniel,"Good! Good! Good! I just got finished with this book 10 minutes ago. Let's see... about 2 or 3 hours to finish today! I just bought it! This by far is the best book Lurlene McDaniel has written, well, out of ALL the books I have read from her, I love her books! The book was very touching, not like most books, that have diseases or illnesses, this is just a fantastic book!"
5,Great book! Empathetic and real-life. . .,"The Girl Death Left Behind is a wonderful book by Lurlene McDaniel. This book deals with normal parts of grieving. See, Beth's parents and brother and sister died when they got into a car accident on the way to a picnic. After they died, Beth is very upset-but not fully depressed. She misses her family, naturally, and she wonders what would have happened if she had been in the car too. She feels guilty because she was the only one left alive. Lurlene really gets into the situation and Beth's feelings about it while still remaining empathetic to real life situations like that one. She manages to stay with the plot even when describing normal things like school and friends and stuff. Overall, this was a fantastic book that really teaches you about situations you never thought about. It was really really good. I LOVED IT!! KEEP IT UP!!"
4,It was a sad but very moving book. I thouroughly enjoyed it.,"This book is very sad. It's tragic story about a girl, whose family died, touched my heart. I learned how to further appreciate the people in my life. I won't take advantage of their presence because I know it could end anytime."
4,The Girl Death left behind,"I thought that The Girl Death Left behind was a very good book. It is about a girl named Beth, her family is going to a company picnic though Beth is sick and unable to go. While her family is on the way to the picnic they get in a terrible accident. As soon as Beth finds out she is brought to the hospital to find that her family is all dead. Beth needs to learn to live with her selfish cousin in Tampa, Florida. When she moves several states away her aunt treats her like a Queen but all she wants is her family.This book is very detailed and lets you know exactly what's going on. I think that anyone who likes sad books or like it when they have no idea what's going to happen next, than this is the book for you."
5,The Girl That Death Left Behind,"Lurlene McDaniel wrote and inspirational book. It shows that no matter how hard life's trial are if you have friends and family who care about you, you can survive almost anything. When rating this book on a scale from one to five I would give it a six. I truly enjoyed it and I wouldn't mind reading more of her books. The book is about how Beth's entire world was turned upside down. A fatal car accident claims the life of everyone in her family. She must now leave all her friends from where she lives and start her life all over again. She knows her Aunt Chammile will take care of her but, it's her snobby cousin Terri who she minds. She is left to deal with the pain of being a survivor and the memories that will haunt her. Can she deal with the pain, and leave death behind?"
4,she did it again!,"Well, she's done it again! She's written a novel that made me think. Not a lot of her books do that, but this one made me think about how my family can die in a second, and how devastated I might be (even if I do despise my step-brothers. kidding! ). Beth's feelings about her new life and new family really toucjed my heart and the book is sure to charm new readers and impress old ones."
5,This book made me cry,"This book made me cry. Lurlene Mcdaniel is my favorite writer. She makes me think about the future. That everyone has a chance to get seriouse illnesses. This book is one of my favorite because i had a sister that died when i was 4. I didn't cry the day of her accident, but reading this book made me realize how my parents felt.My sister now is still thinking about her , but i felt so bad bacause i never got to take care of her.what if my whole family dies and i would have to move away.Lurlene Mcdaniel's books tell me that life isn't always fair.When i read 1 of her books it made me want to read more. Her book was the first book that made me cry, and i don't cry!"
4,Good Book,Good book. Contains all of the conjugations for each and every verb. The only thing that would make a revision better would be to include a sample sentence for each verb with the translation to help learners of this language
4,Helpful For Russian Language Students,"This book is a very useful tool for the beginning to intermediate student of Russian language. It provides a lot of verbs and their full conjugations, which can often be confusing to students.Every serious student should own this book. However, once you advance in ability, you will notice a few shortcomings, such as questionable translations in a few cases. The book also fails in some cases to provide a sufficient explanation of which case is to be used with the given verb in what kind of situation. Still, this book is very useful and will greatly help the student of Russian to learn the typical conjugational patterns of the language. I highly recommend this book to early students of the Russian language."
4,Usefull for learning and memorizing russian verbs,"This book is usefull for learning russian verbs. I recommend it, inspite of some things missing like other people wrote."
2,"If you want to learn Russian, skip this book!","Five years ago as a beginner student I found this book to be totally inadequate. Don't buy it! Instead buy ""A Dictionary of Russian Verbs"" by Daum and Schenk (Hippocrane Books). My book has 20,000 in all declinations with examples of usage. Conact me if you have questions about the book. email: gerryd36@hotmail.com"
3,Nice book but repeats a lot,"Studying conflict resolution can be a challenge but very fulfilling. I believe this book is great in certain aspects, uses real life situations to understand the idea better but repeats a lot throughout the book. I also found this book a heavy read, compared to my contemporary conflict resolution book and other books. Its still a good book"
4,Good Value,"This humidifier has a handsome design that blends in nicely with my living room. I do not use the stand, but just put the unit on my end table in the corner of the room. The only drawback is the lack of digital display, and the difficulty in interpreting and setting the color-coded humidistat. Since I don't use it continuously, it's fine for my needs. I manually turn it on and off when I need to (when the heat's on in the evening).All in all a great value."
1,Great gift if you want to infuriate the recipient,"The only way I could keep my girlfriend from taking the chain saw to this thing was to promise that I'd return it.This thing has a non-functional humidistat. The fan blows no matter what setting.It makes a horrific amount of wind noise.The variable fan speed control has three settings that are all too high.This was used in a 2ox25 sq ft bedroom and still produces a draft.Following less than two weeks of use, the squirrel fan began sqeaking."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HUMIDIFIER!,"After using this for a year--here is what we found: you have to flip the filter about every hour to keep it wet or it dries out except for the tiny part in the water. If you do not buy their products to keep out mold and bacteria, the filter becomes useless in a week. The humidifier is noisey. It blows air horizontally instead of vertically so there is cold air blowing directly on you when walk in the room. Frankly, I am sick and tired of this humidifier producers---we have tried Holmes, Honeywell, and Duracraft. It appears they all ruined their filters so that they will require frequent replacements, or they have issues with their leakage, little output, noise, etc. We are now trying a filter-free Air-O-Swiss. So far we like it but it requires frequent cleaning. At least it works and NOT the constant upkeep buying filters that dry out or become bateria and mildew filled."
5,A Great Humidifier!,"I have used the Honeywell HCM-640BW QuietCare 4-Gallon Cool Moisture Humidifier 2 in 1 Tower for several weeks, and have found it to be without a flaw. It is easy to fill, quiet in operation, and attractive with any decor.I can only wonder about the lower chamber of the Tower. It is easily accessible, but for what purpose, who can say? (Maybe to hide the family jewels!) What is more, it was most reasonably priced."
4,humidifier,"the product does exactly what it is specified to do, quiet and easy to operate,I am very satisfied."
1,Assembly Required with Poor Construction & Directions,I based the purchase of this item on the Honeywell name instead a Holmes unit. That may have been a mistake. I found the produce very difficult to assemble with poor installatin directions. The foundation is erected with plastic parts that have a very flimsy appearance.The one positive factor is the ease to fill the water tank.
5,Great Heater!,This is a great little heater thats really powerful and covers a lot of space for the price. Its also a more attractive unit that is discreet and will not be distracting in the room in which it is used. I was happy with its performance all around.
2,Misleading,"We expected this game to be about the Beatles, the musicians, or at least somewhat music related (because of the front of the box). But really it's a fairly lame version of memory mixed with spoons. It creates little interaction between the players, as there are no turns or anything. You're just all randomly searching for the foods you 'like.' Speaking of food, that's all the game is about. It was okay the first time we played it, but I doubt we'll ever open that box again."
1,Disappointing!,"Had been trying to find this film for many years and, when I finally did, it did not live up to expectations.My husband and I were in South Africa during the filming ... and stayed at the same hotel in Johannesburg as the film company and actors; therefore, became acquainted with and often crossed paths with Donald Pleasance and Brenda Vaccaro in particular.We, naturally, had a keen interest in the film! We somehow missed the theatrical release and, after that, it seemed to have disappeared (now, we know why)! Anyway we are glad to finally have seen it ... and it did evoke some great memories for us!"
2,Don't Bother,"His first book, Edges of the earth was amazing. So I thought this book would be a terrific sequal. Was I wrong. He complains and whines throughout the entire book. The story goes nowhere. A far cry from his first novel. Don't waste your time with this book if you are interested in life in Alaska, read his first book if you can get your hands on it (I know it is out of print). It is full of passion and drama."
1,I Agree,"I agree with most of the other reviewers. I wanted to have a REAL sequel to Leo's first book. This doesn't satisfy. I even Googled him to see if I could find something, anything, to satisfy my curiosity. Nothing! Geez! If he wasn't going to follow up on his life as a human being out there, why bother at all? We already know, from his terrific first book, all about what it's like to struggle with the land and weather the way he does, and how hard it is. Give us something more, please!"
3,"Not as good as the first one, but interesting","The main difference between this book and Leo's first one is the degree of ""personal"" he gives it. In the first one, we read his reactions, emotions and dreams, his failures and victories, and especially his love for his girlfriend and son. In this second book, there's lots of beautiful Alaska, descriptions of animals, weather, struggles for survival, but none of the human touch. I wanted to read a sequel to the first book, to see how Rick's life turned out, but this isn't it. He barely refers to his wife (a native woman?), and his kids buzz around like the mosquitoes instead of being the center of his life. What happened Rick?? Did 15 (now 20) years in the bush harden you that much? Please write another book that fills in the gaps!"
5,dharma bums meets alaska bear tales,"anyone who seeks the deeper meaning in life inevitably entertains the notion of leaving it all behind and heading into the woods. and in doing so, one comes to the conclusion that community and family are paramount to a fulfilling life.with beautiful zen oriented imagery and a compelling narrative voice that might drive you into the wilds yourself, this book has stuck with me for years."
2,Read Edges of the Earth skip Way Out There,I loved Leo's first book and it (along with many other reasons) helped draw me to Alaska. This second book seems to have all of the flaw and none of the passion of the first book.
5,A Slice of Life,"A slice of our everyday lives you may have missed --- Arab Americans immigrated to California like many others. They are hard workers, family oriented and caring individuals. If you don't believe that, please read Janice Marschner's ""California's Arab Americans."" Her thumbnail snaphot of their difficult war-ridden history is a good refresher for the reader and makes their integration into American society, as put forth by Marschner, seem that much more remarkable."
3,Electromagnetic Fields and Waves: Including Electric Circuits (Physics Series),"The book starts off with a very good in depth calculus and vector review. Then moves into the theoretical electric fields. Several good examples are given to help the reader understand the theory behind the derived equations. Although there are some example applications, the reader maybe hard pressed to apply this text to specific problems found industry. Such as, static charge and how it affects material process. The theory in this text, the application examples are not. Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition) is a better applied text for use in industry."
2,White Fang Complete Series,"Purchased this DVD recently. The stories are short but okay. They are annoying to watch because there is 3 minutes of credits and intro's for every single story.Do yourself a huge favor and purchase Call of the Wild with Shane Meier and Nick Mancuso. TV Series featuring 8 episodes, far better than White Fang complete series."
1,Pass this one up!,"I purchased this at a local store for $5, so I can't complain about the price too much. But I would certainly not pay more than that for this series. As another reviewer stated, the music is just horrible! The plots have no depth, and are so short that really not much happens, and what does happen is predictable. Some of the plots had potential if they had been longer. Sometimes the acting is a little too obvious and not very realistic.Also, this has nothing to do with Jack London's book. The only similarity is the name of the dog.I would recommend this instead.Call of the Wild-Complete SeriesIt, too, has nothing to do with Jack London's book, but the story is much better."
1,Worst adaptation yet,"So many translations of White Fang are awful, and this one is the worst of them all! Garishly bright colors and extremely poor animation make it an eyesore and the plot (such as it is) varies so greatly from the original as to be an almost separate story. Everything about White Fang's abusive puppy hood and dog sledding history is neglected, with much of the focus being on a young Native American boy who is his best friend. Anyone who has read the book will know such a thing is laughable. Although the creators of this movie were trying to tone down the violence of an admittedly violent story, I felt that the result was condescending to children's intelligence. No narration and little dialog made the drag even more noticeable. Even though the DVD cover is cute, it houses a dull and lifeless movie."
5,The greatest opera ever written.,"Out of all of Mozart's work this is the geatest. ""The Wedding of Figaro"" has been called the perfect opera. With the mind of a musical genius behind it is one of the most renowned opera's ever."
2,disappointed - First time ever....,"I love ""The American President"" and have it on VHS tape. I wanted to move up to the DVD. I ordered this DVD along with several others and some time passed before I viewed it so I missed my ""return"" window. This was supposed to be a double feature but ""Dave"" was not on the DVD. The DVD I received freezes up seventeen minutes into the movie. There are no visible marks indicating any damage so I don't know what the problem is. This is a new experience for me. I have always, before now, received quality products. Guess I am stuck with it."
1,Great Movie let down by poor quality video,"Being a fan of the ""American President"", I have loved watching the movies previously on VHS and the short lived laser disc. The version that comes with this video is pitiful. the resolution is poor, the image grainy and there are no available subtitles. it looks like a straight transfer from VHS.Fans of the movie (who own anything larger than a 14"" screen) really should hold out for a digitally enhanced version or not ruin your impression of the movie by getting this at all."
5,"great product and fast shipping, thanks",We love both of these movies so it was the perfect combo at a great price. The item came as described and was shipped fast. Thanks
2,American President/Dave movie combo,Not the best quality. I was a little disappointed. I know I didn't pay much but in this day and age of electronics/movies I expected better quality.
2,Poor image compression,We purchased this disc containing Dave and The American President. We love both movies. But the authors compressed the content too far making the disc and the picture comes out blocky showing too many compression artifacts. I recommend buying the titles separately.
2,"Like the movies, bad quality","I enjoy the movies but the quality is just not there. It's been a little while since I watched the DVD but if I remember correctly, one of the movies doesn't even fill up my 46"" flat panel either way. Because of that we used the TV's zoom feature which made the picture even worse.I absolutely can NOT recommend buying this version, even at the awesome price I got it for. If you just want the movies to say you have them, buy this. If you really want to enjoy the movies, buy them separate and get better quality recordings."
3,Great movies but...,"American President and Dave are among my favorite movies. 2 great movies on the same dvd !The quality of the video in these dvds leaves much to be desired. The quality reminds me of something you would see if you taped the show and you didn't have cable/satelite (antenna) and then tried to use filters to reduce noise. The original DVD release of American President had noise in it too but the picture seems more ""pixelated"" in this release. I guess since these movies are well over 10 years old a higher quality format doesn't exist? Actually, My eariler comments about the quality was its appearance on a LCD monitor. It looks quite decent on TV.That being said it is very convient having 2 movies on 1 dvd at a great price, so I would recommend this dvd over VHS anyday."
2,The quality is wanting...,The American President is one of my all time favorite movies...but this product was really lacking in quality to my utter disapointment. The viewing was not pleasurable. I do not usually read product reviews but now I wish I had seen some of the comments from other customers as I would not have bought the item...
1,Liberal propaganda,"""Dave"" is a pretty good movie, but ""American President"" is nothing more than aliberal propaganda movie. I was sorry to see Michael Fox in it. I would givethis no stars, but for ""Dave""."
2,the american president,The quality of the movie is good but I was not aware that it was in letter box format. If I knew that I would not have purchased it. I don't remember seeing anything that said that when I was buying it.
4,awesome and exciting !!!!,"complete live set from the legendary band in 84.The performance is incredible,totally energetic pure OI ! music at its best.Onlydrawback to this cd is the sound.Vox on top of it all,guitar compressed as f@ck and very little drums and bass my various signal processors barely managed to turn into a decent blast of sound.Very reccomendable if you have the adequate amount of signal processing at home(like me)or are not a demanding audiophile."
2,The Voice,"The book was informative, but did not provide information about the victims of this monster. As so often happens, the victims were merely deemed ""prostitutes"" with nothing about the people they were, and they were people...with loving hearts, families, friends and shattered dreams. I knew one of them and miss her dearly. I wish the author had taken a little more time to talk about the victims, and the hardships they suffered in life instead of rationalizing this monster's actions with ""bullying"" as a child.My heart goes out to the families and friends of the victims and hope that some day this author might consider writing about them...."
3,More of the usual.,Like all of these kinds of story....boy meets girl. Doesn't know that he loves her at first. Realizes he does. etc.
3,Emerald,"I enjoyed the theme of the book, but it dragged. I really don't like to read about overly dumb people. This ws how it ended."
5,The three musketeers:A romantic masterpiece.,"This book is great for all the readers up to exciting adventures. The lifes and ded of Athos, Portos, Aramis and D'Artagnan will leave you breathless , hungry to read yet desperate not to rich the end of this captivating tale. (Also recomend The man in the iron mask.)"
5,"An excellent, but somewhat long, book...","The characters are extremely interesting as is the story. I especially like Milady. She is so absolutely evil, but there is just something about her that makes me want to root for her in certain situations. D'Artagnan and his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are also very likable, as they will keep their words as gentlemen even for their enemy the Cardinal. Read this book. It's good and it's easy to understand, just a little long. It took me almost four weeks of reading everyday just to finish, but in the end, it's more than worth the time."
1,This book is not woth a dime,"As a student, I had come to appreciate M. Cheremisinoff work. What a shame he dared to sign such a ""book"". Presentation is lame, design informations is either basic or incompleteDO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. You'll save money, believe meThis ""BOOK"" is not worth a dime."
2,Less Than Wonderful,"An artist past his prime attempting to articulate a message he had not yet mastered (and is not presently living up to). Songs range from good to mediocre to downright embarrassing (""Some Kind of Wonderful"" reworked, for example). Unfortunately, ""Wake Up,"" his best solo Christian album is not represented here at all. Grand Funk lives. Mark Farner just exists."
2,High maintenance,I bought a lot of these to border my flower beds in my whole yard. I am not very satisfied with the product because the stakes that hold the stones in place tend to back out over time and you have to keep knocking them back down every once and a while. Not very maintenance free.
3,Price Way Over the Top,The only reason I paid the price asked was I ran out in the middle of a job and could not find product anywhere else. The original price I paid was just under $16 a box (some one made a nice profit!)
3,Faux Stone Border,"We were satisfied with the product because we have used it on other garden borders and knew what to expect. The border is easy to install and quickly covers a large area. However, it is most definitely a plastic product and looks that way - except possibly from afar. We only purchased more because we did not want to re-do the whole yard."
1,Pain in the b... to put on,I don't use my hang up because these are such a pain to put on and not any more comfortable than than the original set up ...don't bother!
3,"nice, but difficult to wear","the most difficult part is putting them on. After that, they do a good job holding u upside down!"
3,"Great music and dance, short on story","Lovely to look at is the middle of three pairings of Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson. The others (Show Boat & Kiss Me Kate) are classics. This one has a bunch of great music and a couple great dance scenes by the Champions, but the story is shody and the climactic fashion show ending leaves alot to be desired. It does have some memorable music by Jerome Kern and great singing by Keel and Grayson, but the chemistry in the film is forced and it seems more like a patchwork of musical and comedy scenes ala Ziegfeld Follies. At a more moderate price it would be easier to recommend, but for big fans of the leads you probably can look past its faults."
5,Still lovely to look at!,Remembered this from my youth. Was a treat to see again. Granddaughters (4&6) enjoyed the dancing and beautiful costumes along with me.
5,"Beautiful, Functional, and a great buy!","This desk is well worth the money and was easy to assemble. It's real hard wood, and is the perfect size for it's purpose."
4,Great little desk!,"If you have a small space, this is a great little desk. It is simple to put together. Once together it is a sturdy desk. For the money it can't be beat! P.S. Amazon had it to me in two days which was a bonus."
5,"Well-Made Desk, Delivered On Time","I chose this desk because of the dimensions, color, wood grain, and price-point. It was delivered before it was promised, was exceptionally easy to assemble, and it fits perfectly in the room. The thing I like most about this desk is it's made from real wood -- not laminated saw dust. The only thing I dislike about it is in two spots on the desktop, the corrugated steel fasteners (used to hold boards together) are visible -- it's only a mild blemish though."
1,Terrible,"The keyboard piece did not fit with the desk. It was too narrow. This is my second attempt to buy this product. The last one I ordered and returned had the exact same problem. With all the waiting, shipping, unwrapping, wrapping -- this is a terrible buying experience!"
5,Impressed!,"The quality of the desk surpassed our expectations. The design is simple, with no storage, but it is a perfect match for our iMac. It is a great deal for the price and looks nice in our kitchen."
1,"Lousy packing of desk, resulted in lots of scratches.","I just received this desk and although the outer cardboard box was fine when I received it, the packing materials inside the box caused lots of deep scratches and dings in the wood! The desk was packed with some particle board blocks with sharp staples sticking out of them. These were probably meant to keep things from moving around inside the box during shipment, however, 3 of them were loose and guess what... they scratched the heck out of the desk! The packing looks like it was done by a crack addict. Geez."
3,"Not great, not good, but not bad enough to return","I purchased this desk for my home office, and it arrived on time. Assembly was straightforward and quick. Unfortunately, the quality of the desk is very poor. From a distance it looks fine, but the quality issues are very apparent up close. The wood (some sort of soft wood) is not uniformly sanded or varnished. Streaks and unvarnished spots are evident from about 2-3 feet away, and the desk surface is rough to the touch. The desk is solid wood, which I think is a plus, but the overall quality is inferior to what is available at chain retailers for about the same price."
2,Arrived broken,"The desk is a good size, and sturdy. I use it for a laptop on a stand and an external display. Then I have another desk for paper and writing.However, one piece did arrive broken. Fortunately, it was some of the trim from the front, which I can live without. So in my case, I don't have the keyboard drawer cover installed."
5,Great Desk,"I ordered this desk for my new desktop computer. I was very happy when it arrived a lot sooner than I expected. First, I found that the packaging was very good. It was a bit difficult to get out of the box because it was so snugly packed, but I do not see how it could have been damaged in transport. Perhaps they have changed the way it is packaged. Anyway, the desk is a beautiful honey color which matched my furniture exactly, and made of real wood. I was surprised that it was all real wood for the price. The desk was very easy to assemble. It only took about 20 minutes from box removal to complete setup (it may have taken less time had I not been on the phone.) All things considered, I am greatly pleased with this purchase."
2,Packaging problem unresolved -- arrived very damaged,"I really like this desk in theory, but unfortunately it arrived in completely unusable condition, with the tabletop wood split and broken. One side of the desk was broken off entirely, split through the middle of the plank. They do offer part replacement, but it can take 3-4 weeks to fulfill a replacement order and I had ordered this item primarily because 2-day prime shipping was available through amazon. Very disappointed."
2,winsome computer table,I read the other reviews for this desk first; but took a chance that the packing had been improved and that the desk would arrive in good shape. That was not the case. The portion of the desk to which the computer tray attaches was broken off. The packing materials are not sufficient to protect the desk in shipment. Since it was only $100 I didn't want to hassle with returning such a huge box; so I glued the pieces together with super glue and hope they will stay in tact. I cannot pull out the keyboard tray because of the repair I had to do.
4,Desk,"As with this series of Winsome wood products, the design is excellent but the quality of wood leaves a lot to be desired. Nevertheless, it serves its purpose well, and I truly do like it as a computer desk. It is very sleek, and the keyboard slides neatly into the desk and then is concealed by a hinged door. It's just a shame that the wood is not of higher quality, even though the color is beautiful."
1,piece of garbage and company doesn't want to deal with you,"I bought this table and it arrived shattered in several places. The instruction sheet tells the buyer that in order to receive a replacement part, a form has to be filled out, sent to Washington state, and after 2-4 weeks they will replace the part if they are satisfied of proof of purchase. The phone number is not even toll free - the idea is to discourage your call. Sauder is a much better company for inexpensive furniture. Sauder takes your complaint over the phone, sends the replacement out immediately, and there are no questions asked except for the part that you need. Do not do business with Winsome. Buy Sauder instead."
2,Don't risk buying a broken desk,"Beware of the poor packaging, my desk arrived broken. If the desk arrives safely, it is fine but returning a package this heavy and large is a pain. Don't risk it. Don't buy this desk."
3,Handy-Dandy Guide,"Life in suburbia is grand. When my daughter was 4, my wife ran over a squirrel and started crying over is as my daughter said, ""He must have been in an awful hurry to see his family."" Although I'm fortunate enough to live close enough to protected open space for our street to play host to a family or two of deer, road kill is about the closest I come to seeing anything beyond a momentary ""Something wild ran by,"" so this comes in handy. There's a lot of raodkill in various shapes, and after three days, about the only way you're going to be able to figure out what it once was is this guide."
4,"Unique idea, beautifully executed...","This book should be translated in Finnish, so all my fellow countrymen could enjoy it. In spite of all the gore, the overall idea is to bring the miracles of nature closer to the man on the street."
1,Bad quality,It arrived fast. Other than that it was a waste of time. I sent it back and will be charged $5.00 handling for that. Very cheap looking and some of the threads were pulling apart causing small holes in blanket before it was even used. Never again!!!
3,A primer for observing our nearest neighhbor,"Peter Wlasuk takes us on a tour of the moon and shows us how to see the sights. The one thing that disappointed me was that the included CD-ROM was PC-only. It mostly contains a collection of TIFF formatted images and PDF files, very easy to adapt for multiple platforms."
2,"Don't Waste Your Money, There are Better Books, and Cheaper","Wlasuk's book, _Observing the Moon_ is OK if you have nothing else, but there are better references available, for less money. His illustrations are so-so and his explanations somewhat hard to follow. In many cases, his descriptions of lunar features are not illustrated, so one cannot see what he is describing. A better book for the serious lunar astronomer is Ernest Cherrington's _Exploring the Moon With Binoculars and Small Telescopes_, available on Amazon.com for about 1/3 the price of Wlasuk's book."
4,Required Reading for any theatre enthusiast,As an actor this book filled me with a rediscovery of why my work matters and it inspired me to continue in an industry where success is so dificult. Though I am not a method actor i respect the accomplishments of the group theatre immensely and to hear harold clurman tell it is to hear it thorugh the glue of it all. Read this if you love theatre.
1,Trickery of the Music Business...,"This music title: Ultimate 16: Spirit of the 60s[2005] is the exact same music as Spirit Of The '60s[2000] both released by Madacy Records.Same titles, same length, same sequence. Different cover different title but exactly the same music.Just be warn. Still pretty good music and appears to be original artists and original songs."
3,Great for Allergic Newbies,"We have been dealing with my son's food allergies since he was a baby (7 years) and so much of what was in the book is already ""old hat"" to us (whether we're at home or in a restaurant). For someone who is dealing with allergies for the first time, it is nice to have the steps so easily laid out, but for those who already know the game, it's already very familiar. I'm not sure the book offered great benefits to our family at this stage; however, it would have been useful several years ago."
3,Its OK....,"I was a little disapointed because many of the allergy graphs show gluten as possible, so that isn't much of a help, since that was already a given. I guess if you are looking for some where to START looking for gluten in your food, then this is a place to start. If you have been doing it for a while, then you really don't need this book...."
1,Useless to me!,"I bought this book thinking it would be of great help to me. I found it to be absolutely useless. There are so many other valuable tools to use and informative books out there that I can only say - use your common sense - you know what you can and can't have & all you have to do is ask the server to check in the kitchen to make sure that thee either isn't, or won't be, any gluten ingredients used. I live very near NYC and I can name so many gluten free restaurants that weren't included that it's ridiculous. Don't waste your money."
3,I was wrong about this film!!,"I had the wrong idea about this film, but when I sat down and watched it, it got to me.I thought this movie dealt with husband and wife love and it deals with a much deeper love. You have to be a father to undestand this."
1,my favorite actor,"I will watch anything with Richard Chamberlain, but this movie is depressing.Not even his acting makes it worth watching."
1,High Spirits Motion Picture Soundtrack,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that the soundtrack did not include the song performed in the hotel pub scene that everyone sang along to. I do not know the artist's name, but she had a beautiful voice and her harp accompaniment was fantastic. Her song was the only reason I purchased the soundtrack. Imagine my surprise! The music on the CD is very similar to Celtic instrumental CDs found in the $3.99 bargain bin at your local music store. Don't waste your money."
3,Power Mile is a little dull,I like leslie but this 1 mile is different from the rest of her workouts. This tape has more of a set for a back ground unlike her other tapes. She only walks with 2 other people and even though its a power mile its the same as all the other 1 mile walks. She does add weights during a large portion of the workout. I can't recomend this one. But walk away the pounds/abs/express all have good 1 mile workouts.
3,Leslie Sansone Fan,I use this walk with the 4 mile dvd to get my 5 miles done. It's a good 1 mile workout. I gave it 3 stars because there is only the one mile on this dvd.
3,Stereo?,"I'm a bit taken aback with all the raves about the stereo on this disc. There is no stereo! Some of the tracks have the bass guitar one the left track only, but that's it. Everything else is centered. And that's only some of them.That said, the selection is tops. The disc contains songs that have been previously unreleased on compact disc. It is inded an ultimate collection.But it ain't stereo."
2,MONO,"I bought this based on these ""rave stereo reviews"" and the place I bought it from deals primarily in cassettes and vhs tapes (I discovered later). Nothing on my copy of this CD is stereo, not even the bass being in one channel. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,He's A Rebel Review,"It is a must have for any fans of the Crystals. By far, it is the best compilation of their music that I have found. The sound quality is good and it includes a few of their Christmas hits as well as their greatest hits. You won't be disappointed with this purchase."
4,Great for children,This is a great book for determining what animals do to get ready for the winter. It is perfect for younger children/students.
2,Name dropping to the nth...,"This book reads like the script for a James Michener miniseries or an epic blockbuster (it reminded me in parts of the film Giant). My biggest complaint is the incessant namedropping that at times is so gratuitious that I self-consciously found myself looking at the floor to make sure my feet hadn't stepped in any of it. I expect we will see this book on TV (HBO perhaps?) or maybe even on the big screen someday, since Cort is a major producer in Hollywood. Hopefully the real screenplay will do to this novel what central character AJ is supposed to be talented at doing: tightening a potentially good but ultimately sprawling story into a focused unit. It surely needs it. My advice? Wait for the screen version."
4,Great read,"This is a really cool read about Hollywood - lots of cool real people in it and an interesting way to see the dark side of Hollywood. It's a piece of fiction - nice that way - as opposed to one of those pretentious tell-all books. But for me, it's the great story that I love - AJ and his family are really a crazed bunch who fight at home and at work."
2,Characters are undeveloped,"This is a fun read but not a very well told tale. The characters aren't very emotionally fleshed out. For instance, the lead character's mother despises him, but his actions don't seem to warrant it. Likewise, the son hates the lead character but the lead's behavior didn't seem to warrant that either. And, the lead character is described as ruthless by others, but the author doesn't really paint him that way. The end is also less than believable. I bought the book on the discount table at Borders but I definitely wouldn't pay full price for it."
3,Hollywood cattiness,"The main thing this book has going for it is the gimmick of inserting famous characters, like Steve McQueen, as characters. This is a readable, if sprawling tale of filmdom cattiness. The prose has no particular style, and it reads like one of those quickie Hollywood bios written from old newspaper clips. It's a pleasant time-waster -- the type of book that you can enjoy reading on an airplane but can toss aside at any point and not care if you get back to it."
3,An Okay Read -- But My Ultimate Reaction Was 'So What'!,"Action is a story of Hollywood and movie-making told through three generations of the Jastrow family. Cort tells his story in an entertaining, fast-moving style and weaves in many real-life, well-known figures (e.g. Steve McQueen, Romy Schneider, Sam Kinnison,etc.), which creates interest. While the book starts off strong, I found my interest consistently declining as the story moved through ""the years."" Although I was never bored with the story, by the time I finished Action my main reaction was ""So what!"" If you have an interest in books about Hollywood and movie-making, you'll probably find Action to be ""up your alley."" However, if you are considering reading this book because of a desire for a good, compelling plot, I think you should look elsewhere."
3,It's My Body review,"This book is a good effort & very simply based. However, the illustrations are very plain & non-colorful. It was not very sucessful in keeping my child's interest & attention. It is not specific about good/bad-touch examples, but more about how one might feel about them. Unfortunately, I think a child's feelings are often quite confused in regards to this issue, especially when programmed in a continual incestual relationship. So, the message in this book might not be understood by a young child. It could be a helpful book in some cases, but I'm looking for something more helpful."
5,Therapeutic and safe for kids,"A great resource for any preschooler who needs to know about safe boundaries and their body; can be read easily and safely, without making a child afraid of grown-ups or ashamed of their bodies."
4,A short story but the message is clear,"I bought the book to teach my Daughter about her body and the ways that sickos can take advantage of her. The book although the message is clear is not really what I expected. I thought there would be more words and pages but for a young mind it gets the message across, so I guess it worked ! My Daughter likes it, which is the most important thing."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I would return this book if it wasn't such a hassel to do so. Complete disappointment and total waste of money. Each page has one sentence and a lame illustration. Useless. Not impressed at all. Especially for the price paid, definately not worth it! Wish I would have spent my money on a different book."
3,"Batman: Bruce Wayne - Fugitive, Vol. 2","it's ok on it's own, a little better combined with the rest of the series"
3,A detour from the main theme,"Here Batman goes off to find the source of a tainted heroin supply case whilst leaving the rest of the Batman family to solve his own murder case. Batman tangles with one David Said (who?), who works for Checkmate (who?)who are a corporation looking into saving the world. They all tangle with a mutated birdman, from a previous Batman story about mutations. Thus we have two parallel stories running here. Towards, the end, there is resolution on the fact that the two cases are linked, being part of some dastardly plot to do away with the Batman and Bruce Wayne. There is the mention of Lex Luthor as the president being involved, hiring one David Cain as the assassin. Artwork sucks."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Yet another take on Elektra, with not too much point it.Elektra talks for a while to one of her targets. She is offered a deal by that head dude at Shield if she will perform just one small task for them.To get off the planet's most wanted killers, let alone killer babes list, it is not going to be very easy, though."
2,Quite a dissapointing read,I found this book poorly written and badly organized. Moreover it contains little useful information that is not readily available for free through a Google search.There are many far better books on the topic.
5,What does the Sacramento Business Journal have to say?,"Joe Vanacore, staff writer says: Entrepreneurs can learn from book on venture capitalists. ""Brian E. Hill and Dee Power explore how VCs and Es differ in their premises, expectations and frustrations in their book ""Inside Secrets to Venture Capital."" Those differences are so deep that the 300-page book could easily hav been titled ""Venture Capitalists are From Mars; Entrepreneurs are from Venus.""And a cash-strapped small-business man, whether Venusian or Earthling, would do well to digest this book before making his pitch to a VC.""Hill and Power - co-founders of Profit Dynamics Inc., a research and managemnt consulting firm -- spent three years collecting data and opinions from VCs and it shows. They cover plenty of ground."
4,A Mixing Engineer's Dream Package,"Yep. It has pretty much every effect you could want from delays, reverb, voice corrections, distortions, ...you name it. Over 100 high quality processors and over 250 component plug-ins to be more precise - everything Waves has to offer. I visited a local company that puts on trade show presentations and the engineer was proudly showing off his latest acquisition (yes, the Mercury). I guess it is a bit like the holy grail of sound editing plug-in packages. He ran through quite a bit of them and I have to say I was impressed.The current $10K plus price tag may put it out of reach for most home dabblers, but If you want the very best I guess you have to pay for it."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this cd because I love The Animals and it was a great price, 5.99. I should have known it was too good to be true. All their best songs have been re-recorded and completely butchered, particularly Dont Let Me Misunderstood. House of the Rising Sun and We Gotta Get Outta This Place don't fare well either. They made a great British Invasion band sound like a terrible 80's band. This was particularly disappointing because I've been looking for a complilation of The Animals for some time.I am returning this cd as soon as I can, and will buy another greatest hits package of theirs. To anyone considering buying this cd, be forewarned, and purchase a different G.H. set, as The Animals certainly have many."
3,Simply not Eric Burdon or The Animals,Beware ... this CD consists of tracks recorded in the 1990's by a band fronted by Danny McCullough (bass guitarist with Eric Burdon & The Animals in the late 1960's). The band does not include any other 1960's members of The Animals and/or Eric Burdon & The Animals.The CD includes some interesting covers of hits recorded by The Animals and Eric Burdon & The Animals in the 1960's as well as some new 1990's songs from McCulloch and Co.Provides some interesting listening ... but it is simply not Eric Burdon or The Animals!
2,Not what I expected,"While this had much loved Animals tracks on it, they were not originals, which is what I was after. Not sure if I didn't read the previews correctly beforehand but was disappointed that they were not the original tracks. If you are after Animals tracks by the Animals but recorded much later than the originals you might enjoy this cd, but make sure you know what you are buying!!"
2,Disappointment,"I tried Vibrant Health Crisis Intervention Formula because I am so tired of the side effects of antibiotics. I was surprised at how much better I felt while I was taking the product. By the time I was taking my last dose I was fully convinced that I was cured. Sadly, by the next morning my original symptoms were back with a vengance and I ended up in the doctor's office with a now very bad infection. So I ended up on antibiotics anyway on top of being out 36 bucks for this product. I recommend that you go to your doctor at the first sign of a UTI! Don't waste your time or money trying alternatives. I hate antibiotics, but in this case there is no other option. Also this product created some rather embarrasing gastric distress that kept me home bound for the duration of taking the product. Overall I have to say that I did feel better while taking it, but it did not get rid of the UTI...only bought me some time."
4,Water of March,"Fabulous album ,nice listening,especially the bossa nova beat, but above all it is the beautiful voice of Mary Ann O'Doughtery.Her voice is so different than all other vocalists."
5,Amazon sample citation and key phrases misleading.,"As one of the editors of Discovering Biblical Equality, I find the sample citation and key phrases chosen by Amazon to be misleading (unintentionally, I'm sure). I suggest the following:""This book is born of the conviction that both the world and the church urgently need to hear and take to heart the message of biblical equality, because it is at once true, logical, biblical and beneficial..."" (taken from the Introduction).Key Phrases: biblical egalitarians, mutuality, evangelical patriarchy, 1 Timothy 2, partnership, authority, submission (see ""tags"" below...)"
1,Feminist lies from Girly Man,"There is nothing ""Biblical "" about this book.Under god ,the headship of the church belongs the man.The bible says man is the head of woman just as God is the head of man.So many poeple take the world`s veiw of gender roles and ignore the truth."
5,Perfect for adding wood smoke chips,"I do alot of indirect cooking and use several different types of wood for flavor. The Hinged Cooking Grate makes it more convienant and safer to add wood chips or additional charcoal.Number one in my book. Thanks, Vic in Texas"
4,Well priced product,Good product with decent contruction. The hinged sides are sometimes a bit difficult to open once hot. They catch on the sides if the hinged peice is not centered. Good item though.
5,Time Saver,I am very please with the hinged cooking grate. I am surprise that someone did not think of this earlier. It makes it so easy to add charcoal. I do not have to use potholders or find space to place the cooking grate while I am adding coal.
4,Great Replacement Grill Grate,This was exactly the same as the original that came with the grill. It will add years to my grill.
4,Excellent introduction to traditional techniques,"This concise book gives you very detailed, easy-to-follow directions for making traditional Ukranian Easter eggs. The directions are the most explicit and detailed of any book I've come across. Plus, there's plenty of info on traditional designs and their meanings. Not as many full color illustrations as some books...but a lot more detailed instructions and explanation of design components than most."
4,Wonderful Pysanky instructional,"As an artist I found this book most helpful. Not only are several designs given with full, step by step instructions, several traditional symbols are shown helping the artist to create their own designs without abandoning the traditional feel.I did find the book a bit dated, several helpful tools are now available that are not discussed in the book. Also, I would have liked to see more ""tricks and tips"" - these are practically essential to someone just starting out.All in all, however, I enjoyed the book and use the designs often."
2,good but out of date,"The idea is very good, but every 6 months you might have something better, a better open source CRM .... so if you search on the internet you will get better content than the book"
2,Not a favorite knife,"I purchased this knife about three months ago. It is very sharp and works very well...on salad. None of the information on this knife told me it was limited in it use or that it would dull like any knife and I could not sharpen it. Nor did they tell me that I could pay for shipping and return it with a proof of purchase to the company and it would sharpened it for free.I have followed all the use instructions and my knife, like any knife, is dulling. Can only use it on salads and fruits. My husband tried to cut a chicken (a no no) and chipped the knife. Have to stick to salad.I don't think this is a good investment at all."
1,Mr.,"I look like a defect item the blade is over cut, and out of alignment of the knife back. I wish I can give you a negative rating."
2,I expected better,"With the amazing reviews, I bought one for my bf's mom. We loved it for the first week... but then it BROKE off when she was cutting something frozen.. It was totally embarrassing and disappointing that it breaks so easily. I think it would have been better if I gave her a metal one instead. At least it won't snap so easily."
5,Awesomely sharp knife,"bought this knife not knowing what to expect as I had never used a ceramic blade before. It is awesome! I am a convert. The knife is lightweight and handles well, is super sharp and has not dulled despite constant use since I purchased it. It does require some special handling, ie: dont crush your garlic with it, due to the nature of the ceramic but despite this I would definitely recommend this knife (and the pink handle means it is sure that I am the only one to use it, my husband not being a pink fan)"
3,Dull after 1 month,"I ordered this knife after I gave my brother a set of Miyako's. At first it was very sharp and quite frankly I thought maybe I could get 3 months use out of it before I would have to ship it off to be sharpened. Nope, after one month it was dull. I cook almost every evening and it just didn't hold its edge. Don't get me wrong it was a sharp knife and very good quality, but it just didn't last as long as I expected. I think if there was some really high quality diamond steels or sharpeners that are capable of putting an edge back on these I would really consider buying one again. I mean one that I could easily use. I think the theory here is to buy two or three knives and rotate them between use and sending them to be sharpened. Then you always have a sharp knife while the others are away. The down side is the postage. Shipping back to be sharpened is approx. $8.50, and $10.00 for return. This doesn't sound like a good value to me."
1,Unreadable due to poor editing,"I got a headache trying to read this Kindle book. Poor editing, hundreds of typos, run together words, strange capital letters added to words, poor spacing, etc. I asked for my money back. The story is probably fine."
4,Three Amigos,"Three Amigos is slap-stick comedy all the way, I was holding my side the whole time. Capable of entertaning the kids while showing a plot for the parent. In short this film is funny."
4,"After the bombs had stopped, there was still the war","One of Glen Cook's first published novels - although perhaps not ""the first"" - The Heirs of Babylon is set in a post-apocalyptic world that has not given up the fight despite having little remaining reason to fight for anything but civilization's rubble. Decades after the initial conflict, a rag-tag fleet of poorly maintained and damaged ships - a shadow of the state-of-the-art naval warships they once were - sets sail to teach the enemy a lesson once and for all. I thought there was a sort of epic doomed quality to the novel with the ""last ride"" of its final naval armada (have I mixed the metaphor?). Anyway, it's a quick read and worth picking up."
4,Nice carpet but smaller than advertised,The carpet is really 25 x 40. Not a problem but not as advertised. Had it for several weeks already. Otherwise nice quality carpet.
3,"Nothing special, just a reference","As the title implies, this book is just a reference (coveringup to python version 2.0.) The text is understable andprovides a central repository of the same materialyou can get from the official documentation in the web(python.org) The first 140 pages are a tutorial coveringthe essencials of the language with several samples (theseare too trivial in my opinion) following with about 240 pagesdescribing the Python module library (again, the examplesare trivial.) There are also some chapters related withthe ""internals"" of Python, but no one is really ""deep"".Resuming, sadly I think this book (as many in these times)can be easily substituted with the web with little effort."
4,PATH TO DARWIN,"The stories of the early ""fossilists"" and how they interacted with each other in 19th century Britian. Perhaps in a bit more detail sometimes than needed but overall a very good book. Mary Anning,her Icthyosaurs and the men who took advantage of her to make their own names are prominent.Especially interesting is the story of Richard Owen, the brilliant anatomist, heir to Cuvier himself, the man who named ""Dinosauria,"" a staunch conservative and ardent fundamentalist, who unwittingly was seminal to Darwin forming many of his most important conclusions on species origins and evolution! Darwin knew what was coming and kept his mouth shut until ""On the Origins..."" was done!!McGowan writes well and keeps it moving. Not five stars because the story could have used a little humor."
5,My favorite band!,The Standard is such a great band! When are they going to put out more music? While I wait I've been checking out some of the band member's other projects:You Can't WinNot ExoticViolence in the Snowy FieldsRed White Black & Blue Motion Picture Soundtrack
4,Improving vocals,"August grew on me slowly until I was listening to it nearly every other day and I have a strong suspicion that I'll wear out Wire Post to Wire in a matter of weeks. Where as the vocals were previously restricted to either panicky or exhausted tones, Tim Putnam sings a little more confidently this time around. It is not a groundbreaking effort, but any emotional range is huge for a dude that always sounded defeated or like he was running from something.Half of the bands out there could take a lesson from The Standard's cohesiveness as a collective. The comparisons to the prog-rock elite here come from their ability to play as a band (yes, with a keyboard included) and demonstrate their talent without separating into some kind of self-gratifying solo."
2,"What's all the fuss? Not close to Radiohead, no comparison","I don't get what everyone is praising.Sounds like Interpol meets Joy Division...No emotion... no range.Interesting, but I would definately point out that this is not forging a new path. Nothing but a step back into the retro days, and there are enough bands who do it a lot better to be happy with.bottom line- uninspired and rewound... defined, yet interesting, but definately not a must for a good cd collection..."
1,Goat Boy,"I saw this band open for McClusky and Oceansize in Seattle. The singer is annoying (hence the title line). Their instrumental bits are good, yet nothing transcendent. Well below average. Buyer beware of being bored by this band."
3,"First holder was defective, Replacement works fine",This item was shipped to me and the item was defective. One of the pins wasn't riveted into place and made the item not functional. Amazon helped me get a refund for the original product and they shipped out another item. The replacement item works great and is perfect for getting my wheelbarrow up and off the floor.
4,LeHigh Wheelbarro Holder,"I was looking for a way to organize and use space better in my too small tool shed. Things like lawnmowers and wheelbarrows take up a lot of space on the ground. Even a wheelbarrow tipped over on its front takes up a lot of room. I considered making a holder myself, but I knew it would be a bit mickey mouse. The LeHigh holder is worth every penny, is super easy to mount and a pleasure to use with its springloaded clip and the assured ""snap"" that it makes when you put the 'barrow in it leaves me with a sense of confidence that the wheelbarrow is securely locked in place. The only critique from me is that the relatively thin sheet steel material that this bracket is formed from, while more than ample to hold the weight of the wheelbarrow, cuts/scratches the paint/finish of the wheelbarrow when it is hung on the wall."
3,Not for Every Metal Wheelbarrow,"The bottom piece that holds the lip of the wheelbarrow up off the floor is fine, and easy to install. This will work for our purposes; but the top spring-loaded-piece is not appropriate for our older metal wheelbarrow. The position of the handles on our wheelbarrow doesn't allow the top of the wheelbarrow to come remotely close to the springloaded latch. My husband tried to retrofit with additional pieces of wood over the stud to make this work, but eventually I resorted to adding a very sturdy hanging hook to keep the top of the wheelbarrow against the wall. It's a Mickey Mouse solution, but we don't have the right equipment on hand to successfully made the spring-loaded-piece work for our wheelbarrow at the moment. I think it would be helpful for the product information to explain that certain shapes of wheelbarrows may not correctly attach to the top piece."
5,Great Product,"This is a great product, easy installation and really helped to organize my garage and clear up much needed floor space."
5,Great storage solution,"I was a little suspect when ordering this and wondered how well it would work. However, my frustration of having the wheelbarrow constantly in the way prompted me to give it a try. What I found is the hook is surprisingly sturdy and held our contractor grade wheelbarrow tightly against the wall without issue. The trick is to install the hook at a comfortable height so you aren't holding the wheelbarrow at an awkward angle when getting it down or putting it up. Highly recommend this one."
4,Simple. Easy. Works.,"This product works great for it's intended use. I was able to install it in less than 10 minutes and had my wheelbarrow securely fasten to the wall. I don't know if it would stand up to an earthquake or anything, but it works just great for getting the wheelbarrow off the floor and making room for other stuff."
4,Works well with metal wheelbarrow,"I mounted this for use with a plastic wheelbarrow, big mistake. An hour later it had fell putting 2 holes in my wall. Apparently the plastic slowly flexes just enough that it eventually slips out. If you have a metal wheelbarrow and mount it correctly, you should be in business."
5,This deserves 6 stars,"For about $5.00, this has taken my wheelbarrow off the floor of my garage and neatly put it on the wall. Since we don't use our wheelbarrow that often, having it hanging up is a perfect place for it. It is safely out of the way and frees up floor space in the garage."
5,Great Idea.,I got this to get my wheel barrow out of my way in my garage. Installing this was super easy and it works great. Now the wheelbarrow is on the wall and I can walk around the cars easily.
4,wheelbarrow storage,this wheelebarrel holder is a simple concept that stores your wheelbarrel out of the way and most importent keeps water from collecting in the tub to rust. it can be attched to any wall inside or outside as long as you find a stud.
4,Wish I bought this a while ago!,"This is a great idea and I'm so glad I got it! You think your wheelbarrow is out of the way up against a wall not taking up much space, well you're wrong. It's still taking up valuable floor space, that is a revelation I've just had. Super easy to install, under 5 minutes.The only issue I have with it, and would like to warn others about, is that the top holding clip is not at the right depth from the wall for the lip on a plastic wheelbarrow. I think it is more for the metal varieties. If you put a 1x2 under it and screwed through into the wall stud you'd be ok though. For now I just have a bungee through it and holding the lip tight to the wall and it's working our great. I'm glad to have my floor space back!"
4,Good deal,"These aren't the longest lasting batteries on the shelf, but given the price they are more than worth the money spent.We go through quite a few batteries at work, and these have saved us quite a bit of money over longer-lasting, but considerably more expensive brands."
1,Shipped product different than Avertised Product,"The avertised product read ""Maxell Gold"". But, what is shipped is not the same.I don't recommend this product."
3,"Reviewed by Chiropractor Joan Hangarter, Author","Finally, a book that ties together the emotional and symbolic causes of illness in a meaningful manner. Dr. Pop pulls together the correlation between symptoms and illness with lifestyle choices. Irrational thoughts and feelings, denial, and depression contribute to the day to day decisions that translate into illness. Recognition that we are the creators of our own life, and that our health is the direct outcome of choices we have unconsciously made, give sus the key to recovery. By deliberately studying our symptoms and their emotional origin, we can begin the healing process and use the knowledge to create meaningful physical and emotional health."
5,Degrassi - true to life,"This was and still is one of the most unique shows. Canadian drama at it's best. They weren't afraid of what other people would think. They tackled teen pregnancy in jr high, abortion, aids, depression, suicide, disease which is everyday life. There was no sugar coating, what you see is what you get. It is said that Aaron Spelling tried to buy the rights to the show and when they refused wanting to keep the roots in Canada along came 90210, which is a far cry from Degrassi. My health teacher had recorded the shows off of television and used many of the episodes as teaching materials. Growing up with Degrassi was definately a great time, and I will always cherish the memories. Even acclaimed film director and writer Kevin Smith(a creative genius himself) admits to an obsession with Degrassi. Everyone can and will enjoy these shows it is almost guarenteed."
5,"Finally, a true accounting of the events of 20 Nov 68","John Burford wrote this book in a unique and interesting way by telling the story to his family while sitting around the kitchen table. My hat's off to him for a well-told story. It's a must-read for anyone who wants to know the full truth about that fateful patrol of 20 Nov 68. John does not embellish, modify, or exaggerate the facts. From his own research and investigation immediately after the patrol members returned to base, and his own combat experience in that unit, and his own knowledge regarding artillery and claymores, he came to his own conclusions about what actually happened on that patrol. He has put forth an account that differs from the other books written about that mission. It took courage for him to do that. Death and injury in a combat environment are horrific experiences, no matter what the circumstances. History appreciates the truth, painful though it may be."
2,Disappointed with lack of combat,"I hate to give this hero a poor rating, but unless you""'re close to the author on a personal level, 80% of the book is just plain boring."
4,Dardi's notes,I really enjoyed the book because its the striped down story. It's not cluttered with a bunch of specifics like technical stats. Just pure emotion. The thoughts of a person living it. No fluff! It's real and its raw! A good read. If you want to know what it was like during the war in Vietnam you will like this book.
2,Did Jerry Springer make this film?,"This was very disappointing. There was way too much information on the personal failings of Frank Lloyd Wright and way too little on the architectural themes. Yes, you will see all the obvious structures: Fallingwater, the Guggenheim, the Johnson Wax building and the Japanese hotel. But Usonian structures receive about 2 minutes out of 2-plus hours. Yes, Frank Lloyd Wright was a jerk. We get it, Ken. I didn't need dozens of examples on why this was true. My feeling is that if Jerry Springer had done 2-plus hours on Frank Lloyd Wright, it would have looked a lot like this. Two stars for the little architecture we did get a chance to see.You will learn much more about this subject with the A&E; tape called ""The Homes of Frank Lloyd Wright""."
4,another view of an genius: the human side,"this dvd present the personal story of Wright, and as many genius his life breaks the models the same way his wok did"
5,A wonderfully produced film worthy of lots of praise!,Only one word: beautiful. This is a wonderful documentary
2,meandering and mediocre treatment of a American legend,"A meandering and mediocre treatment of an American legend...with too much time spent on the symbolism, exposition, sidetracks and not enough on the subject...Wright & His Architecture. Burns work has steadily gone downhill since The Civil War. Did he produce this piece for passion or pay?"
3,Great documentary spoiled by low quality picture,"This is an excellent documentary, as Ken Burns is a top class film maker, but it is let down by trying to squeeze the film onto one dvd disc.The program is in two parts, each which goes for over an hour.Each should be on its own disc which would have reduced the rate of compression and raised the picture quality.This lack of picture quality affects the well photographed film of the justifiably famous Wright buildings and houses we are shown, and that is a pity.Hopefully this documentary will be available on blu-ray at some time in the future and then we will be able to see these great buildings in a quality that they deserve."
3,"Strong on the personal, light on the professional","This is an entertaining and informative program. However, those who hope to get an overview of Wright's architectural genius may find it lacking. I watched it before spending the weekend with one of his former apprentices, and I felt myself wishing for more historical perspective on what FLW had to offer in the way of new ideas in architectural design. I am pleased to learn more of his personal history, and it probably was important in his professional development. And I guess that abstract design principles will always lose out to People Magazine type coverage in entertainment value. But this series gave me only a bit of what I had hoped for."
4,Coffee Table Book,"This was an interesting book and covered a number of topics involving the find of the Golden Mummies. However, it is more of a coffee table book than a serious tome on the subject."
3,Very Good,"An excellent book on ""how the Valley of the Golden Mummies was discovered"" but writen at the beginning of the excavations. I wonder if the author or any other of the experts would consider writing a new text now that new details are known after years of reseach."
2,Really Cute - But NOT Functional,"There is nothing wrong with the quality, brightness or cuteness factor of this product. HOWEVER, you must plug it in and there lies the challenge. You are obviously meant to string these lights somewhere other than on the floor. The amount of cord that you have from the plug to the 1st butterfly is insignificant and therefore you must use an extension cord to get the lights where you want them. If your plan is to hang them vertically, you won't have a problem. If you want to hang them horizontally, like over a window, you need at least a 3 foot extention cord to make this work...unless you're lucky enough to have a plug in the ceiling :-)"
3,A little disappointed,"These are beautiful lights, but I was looking to use these as a night light in my daughter's room. They weren't as bright as I was expecting because I wanted something to illuminate her room more. It also states on the box not to use them for more than 6 continuous hours and I would be using these for 12 plus hours because of having them on all night. I returned the item for these reasons."
2,Light up your kitchen,these are not toys...they are lights that I use in my kitchen as accent to my windows and top cupboards. I have left the area open above my top cupboards and put in the lights for added pizzaz. When lit they are very attractive and I receive many commments about them and how to get them and where. Use your imagination and these can go anywhere...mantle...windows...window boxes...etc...so much nicer then the regular lights sold at Holiday times.
3,typical Titanic movie,"Typical of most such movies, the first hour is spent introducing the characters and plots, in this case, a few romances among passengers. There is little focus on the crew -- the heroes. The sinking wasn't technically accurate, but more importantly, doesn't portray the confussion and freezing temperatures that added to the disaster. The scenes in the lifeboats are VERY brief. It does try to leave the viewer with the true impact of the tragedy with the numbness of the passegers at rescue and ice in the water. shiver"
1,The Worst Movie Version about The Titanic Disaster,"Cloris Leachman plays Molly Brown (I liked Cloris Leachman in Mary Tyler Moore, but Molly Brown she is not)! Very poorly done movie on the story of the Titanic. And just like the 1953 film (with Barbara Stanwyck) and the 1997 version (with Leonardo Dicaprio), the movie is set around a love story (and even it's not very good). Bad acting, bad everything! There are many great films and documentary's about the tragic voyage - this is not one of them. Also stars David Janssen and Susan St. James."
1,Historical inaccurate,"A movie produced with an evidently short budget, special effect are poorly designed and absolutely not realistic, but what a shame.. the movie is filled of historical inaccuracies.. one of many.. as Titanic strucks the berg the engine room is reported to being flooded.. engine room is at the very poop of the ship and didn't fill until the final plunge.. and not much attention is given to the 1500 people trapped on the doomed ship.. we can't see one raising the railings and screaming trying to save himself.."
3,As far as I can remember...,"I saw this film at least thirteen years ago and I'm positive that in those thirteen years that have passed, there has not been one day that I haven't thought about it, or at least some scenes from it. This film really stood out. It is by far the most memorable version of the Titanic legacy put on film. The craftmanship of the filming was outstanding, and the way the two main characters were actively involved in their surroundings always intrigued me. The actors seem to be more realistic and alluring in their portrayal of lovers aboard the ill-fated ship compared to the glitz and glamor surrounding Jim Cameron's hyped-up version of the tragedy. A truly great film."
2,??? I am surprise....,"I have owned every single VHS Tapes when the RMS Titanic word came out; by far - this was the worse one yet ironically it was almost nearly a carbon copy I think of either ABC or NBC, I can't even remember now of their documentary (their documentary was far better than this VHS) on television! I am surprised ABC or NBS did not smash them for this one, because there is NO indications of approval whatsoever nor authorization either on this VHS anywhere, which is a copywright and copyright violations.In my humble opinion, I do not recommend this VHS in any RMS Titanic Collection unless one wants to collect everything in sight; which would be fine - but to watch it; one word: BORING!There are others out there that are far better than this one."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS CAMEREONS BUT STILL OK !,"NOT AS GOOD A SJAMES CAMEREONS OR A NIGHT TO REMEMBER BUT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEFORE IT IS OK. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IS WAS ONLY MADE FOR TV AND WAS THE FIRST TITANIC MOVIE MADE IN COLOUR. DAVID WARNER MAKES AN IMPRESSIVE FIRST CROSSING ON THE ILL FATED SHIP ,HOWEVER THIS TIME HE SURVIVES(HE PLAYS CAL HOCKLEYS BODYGAURD IN JAMES CAMEREONS VESION) THE COSTUMES ARE NOT VERY GOOD BUT THE EFFECTS ARE QUITE GOOD WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT IT WAS MADE IN 1979 AND ONLY COST ABOUT $2,000,000"
3,"""S.O.S. TITANIC"" (UK/USA 1979)","If you've seen ""Titanic"" (1953), ""A Night To Remember"" (1958) and ""Titanic"" (1997), but not ""S.O.S. Titanic"" (1979), you are likely to be disappointed with the latter, but not eveybody is. It is true, ""S.O.S. Titanic"" is not very accurate in its historical representations of the Titanic story, but the effects (especially the sinking models of the ship) are very good indeed. In my view, the characters are well developed, although (with the exception of the costumes) it feels as though you are looking at life in the late seventies and not 1912. It was the first Titanic movie to be filmed in colour, and I think the producers did a good job: after all, ""S.O.S. Titanic"" is only a made-for-TV movie. Stars include: David Janssen, David Warner, Cloris Leachman, Susan Saint James, Ian Holm and Helen Mirren. Not at all bad, but not in an accurate, historical sense."
1,A great t.v. movie cut up and wasted in this transfer,"I watched this movie the first time a.b.c. ran it in 1979 at the age of 12 and really liked it. I was glad to find it on DVD and bought it. I didn't notice the running time had been cut, because this was a 3 hour movie(2 hours and 35 min. without ads) and this one is cut and missing many important scenes. SKIP IT AND WAIT FOR THE UNCUT VERSION!!!!!!"
3,Decent But Outdated!,"S.O.S. Titanic was actually the first Titanic movie I saw as a child in the 80's on TBS. It wet my appetite and made me a Titanic buff for life. It was made in 1979, so the special effects and production have come a long way since then. The movie is far too quiet and calm to accurately portray what happened that April night in 1912. For a collector like me, this is a nice addition to have. But, for someone wanting a thrilling, modern-day version, get the famous James Cameron version or the 1997 George C. Scott version."
1,Not What I expected,"Thought the movie would have more motorcycles and the actual sturgis event in it, but its more about just following the main guy. Not really sure what the documentary is supposed to be about. I couldn't finish it, it wasn't worth the time."
2,Makes Gun Owners Look Like There On Jerry Springer,"I found this book to be a poor attempt at satire. Being a gun owener myself, I found this book to represent gun owners as fanatics. RIGHTS ARE RIGHTS ARE RIGHTS. Thats great and I agree with that, but put it in a mammer where people who read this dont think that all gun owners are unintelligent. The author is a radio talk show host and the book is patterned after that in your face morning talk show style. A lot of yelling and calling people supid, but not alot of substance. Also, the book is outdated."
5,Gut bucket; New Orleans delta Blues,"I got to give it to Fat Possuum!They keep finding these unknown old masters of the Delta/country blues.Little Freddie King sounds like a cross between Asie Payton, Slim Harpo and John Lee Hooker with that New Orleans juke feel and the Remixes are good also. Little Freddie is right up there with T-Model Ford, Robert Belfour and R. L. Burnside. Great CD!"
2,amazon2011,i dont like it! too flemsey and the tank does not fit. the legs are too close together.the tank is not even a 55 on the bottom. its a long 40g.
3,"Nashville, Tennessee remakes from 1976","[Review based upon Amazon.com ""Sample"" Audition]Strong efforts by Richard, in his final Rock and Roll recording session(s) of the 1970s. If the listener can pitch-adjust the tracks *down*, it's a much more satisfying experience, to this Reviewer/Fan.It appears that only ""Tutti Frutti"" is in stereo. Please sample all the songs - if you insist on stereo here."
1,bad choice,This is a real cheapo disc from K-Tel that has only two original versions of these songs. The rest are either by different artists or bad remakes. Go for the Dr. Demento version or something more authentic.
1,Bad Choice,"Of the ten songs on the album, only two are the original versions. The others are either by different artists (Splish Splash, Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport) or are bad remakes (Tiptoe Through The Tulips, Aint Got No Home, etc.). I recommend not buying this junk."
1,WARNING!!!!!,"This product is NOT chewy. Eating them is like trying to chew through bits of leather. The licorice flavor is ok, but the ""candy coating"" is not really candy coating like on Good & Plenty; it's more like sprayed-on painted flavoring. I didn't buy Good & Plenty because it is tougher than I like, but Good & Plenty is actually soft compared to this. I tried to eat about 5 pieces from the first bag but I ended up throwing the bag away. If i find the candy in the rest of the bags different I'll update my review, but I don't hold out much hope. STAY AWAY!!!!!"
5,An old favorite...,"I remember these as a kid used to come in a box! Anyway, thy're great as always! Right on the money from Amazon!"
1,Something Wrong,"I received the product, and 4 bags so far have tasted like soap...I didn't ever have this problem out of Licorice International..I thought it was me..but my wife tried the product and said that it tasted like Tide Washing Powder....The freshness date has not ran out..So I don't know what the problem is.....I won't stray away from L.I. again.."
5,Pretty good old-time licorice,"I used to get this as a kid in little boxes for 2 cents or a nickle (can't remember). A few years ago, I put this on a 3-month Amazon subscription but they recently discontinued this on subscription.Try this easy recipe: One bag of Snaps and one bag of Good and Plenty. Push one skinny G&P; into one fat Snap. Put them all in a bowl and sit in front of the TV. Eat for an interesting combo flavor.Gary Davis"
5,IT DEPENDS ON YOUR AGE,"IF YOU ARE TOO YOUNG YOU WILL NOT KNOW WHAT THIS PRODUCT IS. IF YOUR MIDDLE AGED YOU MIGHT MISTAKENLY COMPARE IT WITH SOME PRODUCTS THAT YOU MAY RECOLLECT. IF YOU WENT TO GRADE SCHOOL IN THE 1940'S YOU'LL RECOGNIZE SNAPS IN A SMALL RED BOX FOR ABOUT A NICKEL. THEY WERE AVAILABLE IN MOST MARKETS AND GROCERY STORES.THANLS TO AMAZON THE AMERICAN LICORICE COMPANY MADE THIS CANDY AVAILABLE TODAYIT IS TERRIFIC, A MUST FOR MORE MATURE FOLKS AND SINCE IT'S WONDERFULLY CHEWY ONE MAY WANT MOST OF THEIR ORIGINAL TEETH !I AM 79 YEARS OLD AND LET NO ONE NEAR MY SNAPS. PLEASE ENJOY"
3,Avoid the pink ones.,"I've enjoyed Snaps for over 50 years now and know what to expect from this particular licorice candy. There is something wrong with this batch from Amazon. As someone remarked in a earlier review, the pink ones taste ""soapy"". Just a month before this order I purchased a fresh bag at a store while traveling in Minnesota and the pinks were fine. I tossed the pinks and enjoyed the rest, but what a waste."
1,Another K-TEL loser,Re-recordings ... a K-TEL piece of junk. Only Chubby Checker product worth buying is the ABKCO CD and/or MP3's ... these are the ORIGINAL hit versions. Avoid this K-TEL junk.
5,<3 <3,"En verdad, este libro lo recomiendo a todos. El Espanol en que se escribio es un poco dificil, y hasta incluso se usan palabras que ya no se utilizan. Si no ponen atencion, pueden perderse en la lectura por completo, ya que el escritor fue muy detallista. Pero si les encanta los cuentos de misterio y desean leer algo que de veras los traera adivinando, compren este libro.If you happen to find this book in English, read it. A complete mind blower."
3,Not as good as other i.Sound products I've bought before,"I like the look and design a lot, but if you turn it up very loud, it hisses. This is the first i.Sound product I've ever had that I didn't totaly love. It's okay, but not great."
1,Not for me,Could not take the dosage or even half the dosage because of gas and cramps it caused... Wow wicked stuff.
1,TWELVE pills a day??!,"This product is ridiculous. It works, but NO better than many products that cost FAR less. It's OVERPRICED, and you have to choke down TWELVE of these suckers a day. That is just asinine. Plus, the HUGE dosage makes you FART ALL DAY LONG!DO NOT BUY Joint Vibrance. It's a rip-off, and because they want you to jam 12 of them down your throat a day, they are the least economic and most farty product on the market.Beware!"
1,Dolphina...,"I felt there was not enough warm up, and she didn't explain most of the steps clearly. I felt I got a decent workout, but she is a terrible choreographer in the last part of the tape. She showed some of the movements, but did not tell us the order in advance...difficult to follow.Needs to be more step by step."
3,FOR ADVANCED ONLY,I found the moves hard to follow and I took classes before. She shows the moves at a fast pace. Her technique is beautiful it makes you want to learn more so you can look as sexy as she does. I don't know if I'll buy the instructional dvd due to the bad reviews. it increased my heartrate a little so it's good for a low cardio workout.
3,Not too shabby,"As workouts go, this barely raised my pulse. As dance goes, it was nothing challenging or new (but then, I've been dancing for over 12 years so there you go). However, I'll watch just about anyone perform, and Dolphina's performance wasn't the worst I've seen. If you've taken belly dance classes for a year or two you should be fine with this video - nice little review.My ever-present belly dance video tip: avoid Janine Rabbitt at all costs."
4,A true workout,"This is a great workout! I'm pregnant and this video makes me feel sexy despite my growing belly! So far I've only used it a few times, so there are a lot of moves I haven't mastered yet. (This could of course be due to my center of gravity being off!)I also own her introduction video but I found it boring and slow. This one is perfect for me because I feel challenged when I can't do a move perfectly. It makes me want to do it everyday just to see if I can master it! It also helps me to realize that I still have abs and that I can still tone them even though I can't see them anymore!"
3,Don't purchase unless you are really good at bellydancing,"I purchased this video, and i think it's a little boring. Unless you are really good at bellydancing, and you know how to isolate parts of your body, don't buy it. This video doesn't really teach you how to do the moves well. Also she talks too much!You just want to hear the music! If you want to work on your abs and your hips, you should try to look for another video."
2,subliminal conversion,She showed some basic moves but it went really fast. I was really not too fond of all the New Age terms she used (The begining being worshiping the Wiccan Goddess). That has nothing to do with the cultural aspect of belly dance.
4,A Positive review for Dolphina,"I think Dolphina made an excelent tape. She teaches you to work out every part of your body from your neck to your wrists. She's very efficient. I too think that Dolphina is a beautiful woman, and should'nt be nocked for the way she dresses. So she wants to kick up her image as a bellydancer, and throw in her own style. I don't see why people have to nit-pick every little thing. The only thing that I am dying to know is what the magical thing is. She talks about ""awakening the 'kondaline,' 'I have no idea how to spell that or what it is. Anyway she says that ""when you awaken it, magical things will happen."" That's the reason I went on to this web page in the first place. But I just want to let my oppinion be heard and give mad props to Dolphina. You go girl. Go do your thing!!"
1,The Goddess Workout with Dolphina-Advanced Bellydance,I found this dvd a simple instructional video-not an advanced cardio video. My heart rate did not even increase. I recommend The Bellydance With Nina and Mina. They know what a cardio workout is.
2,Not helpful as a workout video,"I could barely work my way through this video once. I have been belly dancing off and on for two years, so many of the moves were familiar to me. I bought this with the expectation that I would be able to practice and enhance my belly dancing while getting in shape at the same time. This video was not helpful as a fitness program - I did not feel as though I had worked out at all. Also many of the moves favored one side of the other, giving an uneven practice and learning. I also thought that several techniques were not adequately explained or showed, and was therefore hard to follow, even with my prior belly dance knowledge.Overall, I was disappointed. I did, however, enjoy the opening goddess salutation, and felt well-stretched and enlivened after that."
2,There are better ones out there,"This DVD covers a number of movements that are important for any bellydancer to drill, though Dolphina is not the best to learn from. She is more of a fitness instructor than a dancer, so I would not recommend this to a serious dance student. If you want strength, coordination and flexibility training that will really help you improve, check out Suhaila Salimpour."
4,Great fun - just don't try and count,"This is the first time I have tried bellydancing, and this tape it great! I'm a quick study with dance (and with a remote) so the steps were not very difficult to learn. If anything, she was a bit talky. It slows the pace once you have the moves down. A bit cheesy with some lines, but it is all in fun. My one complaint - the counting. Being a musician I constantly am keeping a count in my head. About half the time she doesn't end on the right number, or jumps around. Also, she doesn't really maintain a steady beat, something I consider esential for dancing. This may be just my inexperience with the more flowing eastern music, however.Overall, a worthy investment."
2,"not quite the catch, found better models.","doesnt open as easy as you think!put the key in, turn it counter clockwise, and then turn the cap the other way around! or something like this!have to try multiple time with the key to get it in!"
4,Locking gas cap for 2008 GMC Envoy,"Faced with high gas prices, I was concerned about theft of gasoline. I bought the Gates locking gas cap to deter a would-be gas thief. It works great, I am satisfied."
4,"great info but too old, needs update regarding nutrition,supplements and herbs","great info but too old, needs update regarding nutrition,supplements, herbs and excersisei would recoment this book along with a good book about nutrition."
5,Excellent Reference Book,"This book has great photos and projects. It basically shows you how you can make wonderful pieces of art out of the simple process of paper mache..all you need is newspaper, glue, water, tape and you are in business. Painting technique is also covered...great photos. Paper Mache is just not for pinatas anymore!"
5,Paper-Mache Today,I bought this book for a friend who is interested in being creative. He said that this is the most in depth book he has found on this subject. He was very happy with the content and quality of the book.
3,All over the place,"Read this one mostly because the premise, a continuation of Poe's 'Fall of the House of Usher,' seemed too good to pass up. While McCammon does stay somewhat true to the source material he also takes the characters and story through a plethora of tangents that vary drastically in tone, quality and outlandishness that was too hit and miss overall for my tastes."
5,A Terrific Ride!,"I am always on the hunt for the ultimate in haunted house stories and this one tops the charts thus far! What a great ride this book was, making the family history of the Usher's riveting and packing the pages with lots of surprises. I was not disappointed for one second and couldn't put this one down...first time I've ever been able to say that! Excellent writing, excellent fun."
3,"Good Book, Not Scary","Maybe I'm jaded, or maybe books just don't scare me, except very rarely, but I found this to be a very unscary read.Ooooh, there's a guy named ""The Pumpkin Man"". How scary! And a black panther that eats children! Yawn.As a horror novel, this work fails, completely.As a work of gothic fiction, it succeeds with aplomb.The fictional story of the Ushers and their environment is fantastic, and a compelling read. This is a good book and worth the read, but it's pretty far from scary, much less ""terrifying"" as so many readers claim. Do these people still cringe in fear at the creaking of trees outside?"
4,Excellent Story,"I came across this book in a bus station store back in 97. I'd lost my copy years ago, and was so excited to find it for my Kindle Fire HD. You won't want to put this one down."
5,One of the greatest terror novels I've read,"Being a huge Stephen King fan, I was greatly surprised when I stumbled upon Usher's Passing merely by accident. I was looking for something else entirely, but the title caught my eye and I thought I'd give it a shot. I am so glad I did! I enjoy Robert R. McCammon's writing thoroughly, now even more since I was able to procure myself the english edition (my first copy was in spanish, my native language), and this book is a must-read for every horror-fans out there!"
4,Good read,Took a little bit to get into it to begin with but it ended up being very good. Toward the end I could barely put it down
2,Not his best work.,"This book was long and at some points boring. The beginning seemed really good and then it just seemed to go nowhere. I really liked his other books: Wolf's Hour and Swan Song. Two of his best. If you liked Poe's ""Usher"" , then your probably like this continuation of the Usher story. Otherwise, try the other two first."
2,Kind of a disappointment...,"I've read all of McCammon's other books - this one rates on the lower end of all of them. It's a dark book, kind of depressing in fact. I had trouble getting into the book as well as getting into any of the characters. I liked the eerieness of the ""passing"" and how it affected everyone. Eric, I found, was a shallow character for being the main focus of the story. Kind of disappoining, buit since it's one of his earlier works, excusable."
1,A disappointing book for a fine writer.,"This books seems to be almost an afterthought by the author. McCammons' skill at character creation and believability seems to have been on holiday when he wrote this. This has the predictible plot of a book written by the unimaginative J. Saul. What a waste of time to read. Try the much better Swan Song, Gone South, or Mine, before you waste your time on this book."
3,I was disappointed with this book,"I've read a lot of McCammon's work and LOVED Mine, Boys Life, and Gone South. However, I was disappointed with Ushers Passing. I thought the story was weak and boring and the ending was lame.I think that anyone who has read Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" would agree."
3,"Not on par with his best, but still worthwhile.","I must admit this was the MCCammon book of most difficult digestion I encountered so far. Sure, the encounters with Greediguts and The Pumpkin Man made for an interesting premise for the book, but I don't really know, maybe its heavy Gothic touch to it made it hard for me to ""want"" to read it. I held on nonetheless and was glad that I did. A pretty much satisfying conclusion to this story, which I once again emphasize- was not close to his better works, but still close. Did anyone notice he made a reference to Billy Creekmore from ""Mystery Walk""?? I did!!! A pat on the back for Mr McCammon!"
1,Annoyingly gimmicky,"The recording contains nary an unadulterated string quartet track. Each recording is either electronically altered or features additional instruments, presumably native to Mexico. But, who can tell? The booklet contains no program notes--just 15 pages of unidentified images, presumably from South of the Border. Many of the tracks end with a faux ""on location"" soundscape. Did the album's producer imagine there was an audience for random street noises, laughter and snippets of conversation? I wanted music, not feeble attempts at sound collage. And then there's the music itself. While each piece was performed with undeniable zeal by Kronos, none of it, in my view, was the least bit memorable. The sole representative from the ""classical"" repertoire, the arrangement of Revueltas' Sensemaya, illustrated to me just how important the original orchestration is to the success of the piece. Ackk!"
1,Kronos Nuevo. Not for me.,"I bought Nuevo some time ago with the expectation to enjoy, as always, the powerful musical experience provided by Kronos. I`m afraid I was deeply disappointed as most pieces are not necessarily interesting from my point of view (except for the funny Chavo Suite) and Kronos performance was unable to capture the Mexican sensibility. Definitively, I would not recommend Nuevo to people just introducing to Kronos music. Fans will be probably as disappointed as me."
3,screeching mariachi's,"I bought it for the one-armed grass-leaf player. It's worth it just for that, but the first track is enough to put you off the rest of the album. It gets better once the rhytms overtake the sound."
3,"Good music, disappointing liner notes","At about 66 minutes, this recording is a better value than some of their CDs. But one almost constant complaint that I have with Kronos Quartet releases is their poor or non-existent liner notes. This release is especially guilty. There is a big, thick booklet of worthless photography--mediocre pictures reproduced poorly on cheap paper. Were they trying to throw some some photgraphers a bone? There is nothing about the composers (except their birth dates) or their music, or the musician's perspective, etc. And, since some of the composers are deceased, an opportunity was lost to discuss their music and their lives.Very, very poor production decisions."
2,Jarring (And Not In A Good Way),"I hate to be a contrarian, as most of the reviews of this album have been so positive. However, I have to say that I was quite disappointed in this album. I love new music, and don't mind modern interpretations, but this album is a true cacophony. Some of the selections are actually physically difficult to listen to, reminding me of nails running across a blackboard."
3,different item received,"I ordered what is described in the picture on the website, which is the older version that still contains formaldehyde. However I received an apparent newer version that does not contain formeldahide and while it may break down the waist it does not control the odor anywhere near as well as the formeldahide version."
4,A real page turner. Read it,"Few marketing books has the enjoyable read character. it is safe to say that Big Brands...Big trouble leads the pack. Concise yet informative, the book focus on the notion that marketing is about winning your customers' minds and hearts.By going through ample examples of famous brands, Mr. Trout dispel some of the conventinoal strategies most companies blindly undertake. Line extention according to him, has done nothing but damage to At&T; and Miller Brewing. The giant P&G; has lost big on the toothpaste line becasue they forgot what made their brand a hit. Fashionable outlets such as Levi' and M&S; needs to rise out from the past and look more into the future by developing their own unique ""brand lifestyle"".On the dark side, the book is relatively redundant and by the end of it, it looses out. Also, the recurring negative remarks on another business guru ""Michel Porter"" was needless and hence lost the book the full the mark."
5,My Man Jack,"In his signature style, Jack has taken us to school on brands who once had it, lost focus and struggling to get it back. I like this book because some of the things Jack mentioned in the book for some companies, should be common sense. I really enjoyed the section on consultants. I highly recommend this book for every marketer in any industry because there are some lessons to be learned no matter what product you market."
2,"A good concept, but edition 7 is now needed!","A listing of commercially available fibers, fabrics and prepregs from the advanced composites industry. Also some thermoplastic products. The directory provides an alphabetical list of most the manufacturers and suppliers, including phone and fax numbers, and addresses. But no websites nor e-mail info. Main focus is rightly on carbon or graphite fibers, but aramid (Kevlar, Twaron), UHMWPE (Spectra), High strength glasses (S-2 glass) and ceramic fibers are included. Useful features include glossary of terms, with translation table showing English, French, German and Italian. And also an index of trade names. Proof reading OK, but could be better, e.g. a table comparing 21 high performance fibers incorerectly showed data for R-glass listed as S-glass, and for Hercules IM7 as IM8. The other 19 were accurate. Potentially very useful, but to be 6 years old in a rapidly changing industry is not acceptable, especially at this price!"
4,Still moving souls...,"Again BNC ushers us into her world of melodious, heart-felt music and haunting lyrics. The first (Trying to Love You) and the last (I Found Your Love) are very typical BNC through and through. ""Look"" is a piece of remeniscence although too bluesy for my taste as ""Right Back Into The Feeling"" smacks of too much R&B and seems a bit unsuitable for BNC style. The longing for lost love is again relived in ""Touch My Heart"" and ""Time Won't Tell"" but BNC has that unmeasurable ability to put those undescribable feelings into music and words. This is another must for you BNC collection."
5,High quality wallet,"Very nice quality wallet. I need the double sided ID window and lots of room for credit cards. ID window is a little larger than usual, which makes it easy to get ID in and out if needed. Card slots are a little snug at first."
5,Loved it.,"First I love Dee Henderson's books, every one of them. All the books in this series are great stories. I could not put them down once started. It has been a long time since I have read them and I want to go back and read them all over again."
2,Proselytizing a Huge Turn-off,"When the hero (Dave) first told himself he could not date Kate because she was not a Christan, I hesitated to read further. I thought perhaps he might become more open-minded as the story progressed. When Kate's sister starts shoving the Bible on her, I rolled my eyes, but still continued on. This book is written for people who believe they have the only answers and arrogantly believe that people with different beliefs are always wrong. I hate it when an author preaches. This arrogance among evangelicals is one of the reasons I left organized religion to begin with. If the purpose is to bring people ""into the fold,"" it failed miserably with me."
5,Love this series,We owned the paper copy of this so we enjoy the kindle version just as much. Love the O'Malley series.
4,great story,This is a great story of redemption and why you need Christ in your life. Loved this story and the mystery of it all
1,The story would have been ok but...,"The preaching totally turned me off. The story was good but when the author started pushing her religion, I just skimmed through the book to get to the end."
2,Could not get through it,At first I thought the author was doing a fairly good job of developing the characters. However about 2/3 of the way through it I just got bored. The connection between hero and heroine seemed tenuous to me and I did not really care who had done it or why which is to say the plot development was lacking. The family connections did nto seem to hold water and got too melodramtaic. I also found the religious conversion overtones very distracting.
2,"christian propaganda, angst, and no sex","I almost gave this three stars, but I'm going with two because I don't think I'm going to finish it. I'm about 2/3 the way through this story, and the negotiation scene was great, the dialogue is cute, but the hero and heroine have been in each other's company for seemingly EVER and they haven't even freaking kissed yet. And the hero has decided he can't marry somebody unless they believe in God/Jesus. And he talks to God in italics, pretty regularly now. First time I've seen this in a book, and honestly I can't stomach it."
2,Too Preachy,"Story line was good for a crime novel, I just wasn't expecting the author to preach Christianity at me, and I found that I started skimming over parts of the story because I didn't want to read it.Thanks, but no thanks."
5,Logical vs. Heart!,"This is an awesome read. Kate is the best at what she does...hostage negotiations. She can keep her cool in the worst of circumstances. Dave is a sold-out-to-Christ kinda guy. He's completely comfortable with his faith and his job as an FBI agent. What happens when Dave meets Kate, who wants nothing to do with a God that lets bad things happen? What happens when Kate meets Dave who manages to continuously slip under that emotional barrier that makes her such a good negotiator? Throw in an intriguing mystery and BAM!! you have a must read.I dare you to try this one. You won't want to stop here."
1,Boring,Frankly I'm surprised by all the great ratings and reviews on this novel. I found it boring and repetitive. The dialogue is corny and predictable. There so much speculation on the characters mind that it feels as though nothing is happening.
5,great book!,I was very impressed w/ this book! Towards the beginning it wasnt into it so much but by the 2nd or 3rd chapter i couldnt put it down!
3,Interesting at first,The story was interesting. I stayed with it because I wanted tosolve the mystery and see the characters develop. Two thirdsof the way through I had figured it all out and saw where eachcharacter was headed so the last third was anticlimactic.It was somewhat far fetched but then thrillers usually are.People who enjoy romance with some mystery might like it.
1,christian centric not what I was looking for,"this masquerades as a fiction book, but it's really a christian love book. not what I was looking for in a good read."
4,The Negotiator opens at a run!,"You are immediately thrust into Kate O'Malley's world. She is a crisis negotiator with the Chicago Police Department. Dee Henderson introduces the O'Malley Family very well in the beginning of the book, setting up the subsequent O'Malley novels. The relationship developing between Kate O'Malley and Dave Richman (you'll remember him from Henderson's ""Danger in the Shadows"") is weaved nicely throughout.There is plenty of action, suspense, drama and even a little comedy. The characters are supremely likeable. I highly recommend every book in this series! They are all real page turners.The other O'Malley novels are: The Negotiator, The Guardian, The Truth Seeker, The Protector, The Healer, The Rescuer. Each is a wonderful read!"
4,entertaining,"Dee Henderson is a writer that I enjoy reading. The story line is exciting yet heartwarming, and their is a clear message that is given."
5,You've GOT to read this book!,"Ok, So I wasn't a fan of christian fiction until I read this book. I couldn't exactly escape reality in the Left Behind Series, and I really don't like my fiction to mix with my reality (So, I'm a chicken...). Dee Henderson has become my FAVORITE Christian Author. She has a style that is so fresh, and so wonderful. The story she potrays of Kate and Dave is amazing. Read this book, and you'll be looking for a man like Dave. (Or Marcus, BTW...The Guardian is on the tippy top of my faves). I now have the ENTIRE O'Malley family series. I will be starting book 3 as soon as it comes. I'm so excited. These are the best of the best. Don't just take my word on it, go, read, NOW. Trust me, God will bless you tremendously if you open your heart, and learn. God Bless."
5,Dee Henderson has done it again!,With THE NEGOTIATOR Dee Henderson has again written a riveting story of romantic suspense with an underlying theme of Christian love. The mystery element is at the center of the story -- and what a mystery it is! The relationship between Dave and Kate is very realistically portrayed. I enjoyed this story so much I passed it on to my husband to read.
1,possibly the worst book i have ever read,"wow this book is so incredibly bad. not only are the characters all extremely annoying, simplistic, and utterly lacking in depth, but also any possibly interesting aspect of this story is totally skipped over. The ""dark past"" of the main character is only ever vaguely referred to. The childhood of a band of orphans is presented completely happy-go-lucky. The whole conversion to christianity aspect is so incredibly simplistic that it's AMAZINGLY patronizing to a non-christian. The whole falling in love aspect is so incredibly simplistic that it's AMAZINGLY patronizing to any, um, human beings... and how come all the characters are white? a bunch of disadvantaged kids who meet in the inner city- probability says some of them will be non-white.edit: I suddenly stumbled on this old review of mine, and the 2nd paragraph was a little over-the-top. I've matured & will now leave it at ""I strongly disliked this book."" Thanks for the advice K. Moore :)"
1,Boring Unrealistic Characters,"Sorry, but I thought the characters were completely unrealistic especially Kate. They were cardboard characters that really didn't pull me in. I suppose that I read too much and I do have high expectations, but this wasn't even tolarable. The Christian perspective didn't bother me except to say that Kate was too cookie cutterish as the non believer.The mystery I found boring and have read better mystery in 2nd grade class (sorry but I did spend 11 bucks on this) and these two characters had NO chemistry together. NONE. I love novels were the characters are dripping with chemistry. If you want chemistry suspense and good characterization, skip this novel."
1,Reeks of amateur work,"Awful. Predictable, unconvincing, childish. Irritating, unbelievably plasticine characters, flat theme. Waste of time and money."
2,Kinda disappointed,"I was kind of disappointed ... had heard good stuff about the O'Malley series and I was looking forward to reading all of them but I likely won't now. The characters didn't seem to be well-developed. For me, all of the characters need to have enough depth that I am interested in all of them ... this book would be great if you enjoy light reading."
4,Suspenseful _and_ romantic!,"Within the pages of The Negotiator you'll find a nail biting, well developed suspense, a sweet and equally well developed relationship and some fine secondary characters. The plot is tense, and at times the romance becomes secondary to the suspense, but still I found it nearly impossible to put down. I highly recommend this to fans suspense fans."
5,Loved it,Was a second thought grab at a book store and ended up buying whole series after reading this one. Great book. If you liked it read the others.
2,the Negotiator,I have to agree with reviewer Yankiwi. this book hits onreligion too much to be in the crime/passion category.If I want conversion to Christ I will go to church toseek it.Also the love scenes are non-existant. People inlove do kiss and hold each other. Not worth the read.
1,Christian book with no passion for believers only,These books should be in the Chritian section NOT the general section. I am returning all five I bought- she may be a good writier BUT the non-dsiclosure of the CHRISTIAN advocacy is wrong and Amazon should be ashamed! I don't buy books to be proselytized to by anybody's religion.
5,Very Exciting Book,"This is a great book -- really exciting! If you are going to read this book, you might want to buy her book, ""Danger in the Shadows"" and read that first. It is also extremely exciting, a great book, and it has some of the same characters as are in ""The Negotiator"" but at an early age in their life."
2,"Well-written, but disappointing","When I stumbled upon this book in the O'Malley series, I thought had found a respite from the usual, formula Christian romance books I had read. Kate was a strong female character, a welcome change from weak female characters who play the smaller part in the Christian romance genre. The book is well-written, however, there was much too much emphasis on the action, and mystery and not enough on the relationship. I liked the back story about Kate forming a family with the other orphans, THAT was something new. Like other readers, I could not finish reading the book. My interest was lost somewhere in the middle. I assume Kate and Dave got together in the end, but by then, I just didn't care."
3,Pretty Good,A good read. I was kep interested and it moved along quite nicely and is just long enough. It's a little bit crime and a little bit romance. The characters are genuine and I loved that it has a message.
5,Great series!,"This is one of the best series ever! The author does a great job of building the story, making me want to read more."
1,Propaganda is not Literature,"I did not acquire this book thinking it was going to be great or that it would have actual literary merit. I purchased it to be entertained. That being said, it was not even written with the intention of entertaining, its evangelical Christian propaganda was forced and made the characters highly unlikable. You are welcome to write with the intent to try and convert but please put a warning label on so people who are interested in entertainment and not furthering your agenda are not misled. Oh and work on your plot and character development; they were sorely lacking."
2,"Hostages, terrorism, and Gone.","I enjoy reading police stories, and occasionally study the Bible. But, not in the same book. I was settling in for a good cop story read, only to come to an abrupt halt with a long related go us talk."
2,"Good plot, weak telling","Unraveling of the plot is long drawn out, even though the plan might have been good.The religious stuff, then, it has nothing to do with it."
3,"Interesting storyline, but drags at places","Interesting storyline, and well built up characters. However, degenerates into a too much of religious sermon and is pretty slow at places. Still is a good weekend read."
3,"Good, rollicking story, but rather smug ""Godliness"".","I enjoyed the storyline, character development and interactions. I was rather put off by smug discussion on ""God"" (yes, the old man who made everything and controls everything) and the assumption that only Christions can have a happy hereafter.Ignore that, and it's a good read."
4,Great Read.,"Really enjoyed this book - more than I thought I would. In fact, I am now looking for the other books in the series."
4,Love At First Sight.,"Oh, Dee Henderson. You did it again. The first O'Malley book focuses on Kate, the negotiator who seems to find herself in pretty precarious situations. Such as a bomb-strapped man in a bank. As Kate races to solve a mystery centered around a plane that was blown up, she is also confronted with the presence of Dave Richman, the FBI agent who seems to always be around. But when the mystery turns personal for Kate, Dave has to protect her before she walks into a situation she can't talk herself out of.Overall, a great book! Kate and Dave are both fascinating characters, and its a great starting point for the O'Malley series. Dee Henderson manages to craft stories that never seem overly simplified or ridiculous. Such a great book!"
5,Great faith based suspense,I loved this series of books. It's so hard to find good suspense books with a solid religious theme and characters that you really come to care about. Most mainstream suspense novels have little or no faith based inspiration and for me the inclusion of a faith based perspective is what makes the O'Malley series a five star read.
5,love this series,I love reading mystery and suspense and have never read a Christian writer before... I must say that this is one of the better series that I have read. I could not put the book down until it was finished and then read each of the O'Malley books every night thereafter!
3,I've heard this all before...,"With reading all these awesome reviews I was looking forward to receiving this album, and now i'll probably be putting it up on eBay sometime soon.To put it rather bluntly the album bores me. I mean haven't we basically heard this all before. Nothing really original or innovative. I don't think his lyrics are all that witty, and the topics he speaks about are all commonplace. The only other time I've heard J-live was in Dan the Automator and Prince Paul's Handsome Boy Modeling School. In ""The Truth,"" he is so witty and uses a common law theme throughout the track. It was one of the best rhymes I've heard. I was expecting more of this, but it is few and far between.The production is pretty solid with some decent scratching. J-Live definetly has skills, and comes out with a solid release, but he brings nothing new to the hip-hop table in terms of production, lyrics, or delivery."
5,WOWWWWW,"I just heard of J-live about a week ago, and have been listening to him ever since, this guy is amazing. This is one of the best albums of the year, if not the best! Be sure to pick up his other album, as well, called ""the best part""...."
5,Hip-hop's Bob Dylan?,"Hip hop is usually rated on a few different aspects; allow me to quickly run this album through the hip hop rater machine:Flow: A+ quality. Very confident, very versatile.Content: Very smart; each line leaves you craving the next one... his verses aren't just thrown together.Beats: A. Lush, diverse and atmospheric.Extra: We have some great turntablism provided by J-Live himself, as well as some excellent jazz guitar work provided by Soulive's guitarist Eric Krasno.What really seperates this album from most other hip hop is, oddly enough, the song-writing. As his liner notes explain, each song tells a specific story or is about something. It really makes for a great listening experience."
4,"If you've seen Airplane, you must watch Zero Hour!",What a fun movie. You'll understand where the movie Airplane got all its ideas.A must see.
3,I Liked it!,"Even though it was campy, and at times over the top, it was pretty entertaining. No it isn't (and shouldn't be) some deep, thought-provoking piece of film noir. Nor was it full of screen-flashing special effects. There was just something about it that made you want to see how it turned out. Sort of like those Saturday afternoon westerns that you can almost predict the outcome, but you end up watching anyway. One interesting note is that while it was the basis for the comedy ""Airplane"", you can also see places where the later and much more sophisticated ""Airport"" made in 1970, got a few of its ideas. It's not the best movie ever made, but it held my attention and I liked it."
3,"""I picked the wrong day to quit smoking!"" No, seriously!","I have never laughed so hard at a completely serious film.Wow...this is capital-A AWFUL, but deliciously so.Yes, they got a lot of stuff from 'Airplane' here, but that's missing the point. Somebody made a film where Sterling Hayden actually says, ""I picked the wrong day to quit smoking!"" And he MEANS it!Seriously! I howled!And then the stock characters, sprinkled throughout the cabin, stricken with that horrific mysterious disease known as ""food poisoning""!When you get to the part where the post-traumatic-stress-disorder ex-pilot has to fly the plane, and his estranged wife ends up being the co-pilot, your abdomen will hurt from laughter, which for me sucked because I watched this during my recuperation from hernia surgery...It's gleefully bad, but ya GOTTA check it out..."
5,If you like Airplane!...,"Hysterical serious film that was the inspiration for Airplane! -- same dialogue, same crazy food poisoning. A MUST for any Airplane! fans."
3,interesting for it's curiosity value as the movie spoofed by Aiplane 22 years later,"it's hard to watch this movie without thinking of Airplane,the moviewhich spoofed it 22 years later.in this case,the movie itself is asmuch of a parody as the movie that parodied it.Zero hour is rife withhammy over the top the top dialogue that just begs to beridiculed,along with wooden over the top acting,and silly speeches.itreally is almost a comedy.having said that,it does have itsentertainment(and curiosity)value,and it isn't like it'sunwatchable.interestingly enough,i found that (at least,for me)Airplanedoesn't hold up over time,and found Zero Hour more entertaining.if yougo in with moderate expectation levels,you shouldn't be toodisappointed in this offering.for me Zero Hour is a 3/5"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Only worth watching if you want to get more of the gags from the far more fun Airplane!, Zero Hour is a leaden B movie that deserves little more than our mockery and scorn."
3,OKAY,WASNT BOUGHT FOR MYSELF BUT THE PERSON THAT I BOUGHT IT FOR SAID IT WAS OKAY IT IS WHAT IT SAYS IT IS NO MORE NO LESS
3,Better than I thought it would be,"Reading the negative reviews, I was hesitant, but once I took it out into the field, I found that the issues that people had with it, were in all actuality something that I could learn to live with. All in all, this is a pretty decent spotting scope for the money. Obviously, at 20x the field of view is great. When I zoom up at 40x, it is fairly reduced, and at 60x the field of view is very small. It really ticked me off!! But here's the rub... if you place your eye right up on the viewer, it is just fine. In half light, right before dusk, I had no problems sighting a 12"" target @ 100 yards. that is why I bought the spotting scope in the first place. I hope that it holds up, as it is very light weight, and feels a bit cheap, but the body is polymer/rubber. It's supposed to be light. All in all, not too bad. Not too great, but for less than $100, it's okay."
1,Tasco Terrible,"I bought this scope to spot with when I shoot my rifles, took it to the range for the first time sat it up and began shooting, when I looked through it, it was so fogged up I couldn't even see the target. It was completely useless, sent it back for replacement, but shipping on the replacement wasn't until May or June. Asked for refund, haven't received that yet.Don't buy this scope."
5,Worth It,"Just viewed our first Eagle - beautiful. The scope brought it right in. Well worth it, the included tripod is invaluable."
5,It's a drill!,No complaints. I have used it once to drill into concrete. Went through like butter with my hammer drill. This is good for home use. Professionals will want a higher quality steel.
4,Interesting first novel,"This was a fun read. Lots of great technical detail, but it doesn't overshadow the story, which is an entertaining story of interstellar culture. It reminded me in some ways of H. Beam Piper (though I'm not exactly sure why).I don't think Diann Thornley is another Arthur C. Clarke, but she can write a good story--enough so that I was moved to read the other two entries in this series."
1,Junk,"Bought one about a year ago, real cheap from a different site, exact same model according to the sticker and the looks. Instructions are actually WRONG on how to pair it, quality is 100% terrible, 1 step below a tin can and string. I tested this with both my computer using a BT dongle, and my LG VX 8350 and LG VX 8300 (Verizon) - results were slightly better on my computer, but still well below acceptable. Static was horrible, and range is at best 10-15 feet. I would never punish someone (or myself) by using this device to speak with them."
5,GREAT BOOK FOR TELEMARKETERS,"ALL THE INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK IS A GREAT TOOL FOR YOUR BUSINESS, WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS GREAT BOOK. GET IT NOW..."
5,A Must-Read for All Sales Professionals,"This book is absolutely loaded with insights and practical ideas you can use to increase your effectiveness in dealing with anyone in business on the telephone. These ideas should be read, taught, digested, and practiced every single day."
5,"Buy This Book, You'll Be Glad You Did!",Want to make more money? Want to learn how to REALLY sell on the phone? This is the book! I have purchased and read many books on teleselling but this one is the best. Specfic strategies that work! Highly Recommended!!!
3,Nice recipes shame about the writing and editing,"Having done most of the receipes in this book I was impressed with Nadine's ability to blend flavours to produce the most wonderful dishes. However the book is serverly let down by some poor editing, terrible instructions that either confuse or prattle on to the point of gibberish. On this point I would have given it two stars. But because I would recommend it to a friend because it shows vegertarian meals are not just about beans and peas, it got three. Hopefully the next edition will be better written and edited."
2,A Reference Book,"This book on New York City is not a run of the mill tourist guide with up-to-date recommendations for hotels and restaurants.Rather, it sets out to explain in fascinating detail all the sights offered to visitors and New Yorkers in that great city.The book is clearly set out and complemented with (a limited number of) quality illustrations that include colour photos, drawings and maps. Its weight however makes it impractical to carry around and it is most useful if read before or after a visit.In fact, technology provides us today with better `tourist aids' that are lighter, more user-friendly, more beautiful and constantly kept up to date."
4,"Rich in facts, handy in size","If you want a compact, portable, and encyclopedic guide to New York, this should be your first choice. In fact, your only choice. There are books with more nuanced and detailed history, books with more practical details, books with better maps and illustrations, and books with more style and attitude. But for a systematic, fact-packed stroll through the streets of Gotham, this is it. As a professional guide, I have a large library of books on New York City; this is the one I carry it with me for quick reference."
5,The Best Architectural Guide To New York City,"Simply the best book available for those seriously interested in a detailed architectural history of New York, even though the most recent edition was published in 1991. Unbelievably rich in detail. As other reviewers point out however, this is NOT a typical ""tourist"" guide about where to eat, sleep or have fun in New York."
5,magical purple bus!,From the time that the catalog from lego first appeared at our home my son begged for this bus. For a gift he was able to get it. He has not put it down since. It is a snap for expeirienced lego builders to put together and the great part of it ? It use's purple lego's! How great is that? It makes them special since as far as I know they have not been made before and only for this toy! He has absolutely fallen in love with this bus! A must have for lego fanatics and Harry Potter fans!
3,arrived damaged,Great toy but arrived with a broken front axle. I couldn't get it away from my 5yr because he loves it even though the fron wheels don't work.
2,Good Clock - When it Works,"I got this clock as a gift off of my wedding registry from Bed Bath & Beyond. I first turned it on in March 2012. It worked great for the first nine months, and adjusted with no problem to the two time changes that occurred while it was on my wall (though once it took overnight to adjust). However, within the last month, the second hand began stopping at 51 seconds but the minute hand would continue to keep the correct time for a few minutes until the clock would attempt to reset itself by spinning the minute hand. It would continue spinning until I pulled the battery; pressing any button on the back of the clock did nothing. I would usually let the clock sit for a few hours before I put the battery back in and the clock would work fine for a day or two until the whole process started again. Not putting the battery back in this time, and I'm going to look for a new clock to hang on my wall."
1,Atomic clock,"This is the only Atomic Clock that I own that doesn't automatically adjust for Daylight Savings in the various time zones. Once set (using my computer's clock) it does keep time. I would not recommend this product, and I only purchased it because it is branded SHARP. Thank you to the reviewer that figured out how to change the time!"
3,Works fine but second hand irritatingly loud,"I had no trouble getting this clock to work properly (the clock was stated in the fall when DST was off). But this has a loud, irritating, second hand. I have yet to find a room where I can live with this clock."
1,Do not buy this,"$35? For this? When it works, great, everything's fine. When you have to change the battery? Another story altogether. It's junk. It's Chinese junk. I'm not going to buy any more cr*p made in China, I'd sooner buy OLD US-made stuff from eBay if I have to. China. Makes. JUNK."
1,Hard to work junk,"We bought this clock two months ago, and finally threw it away. When it worked, it kept good time, but It would frequently stop working and just start spinning. This would go on until the battery was removed, and replaced. It would reset, and work for twelve hours, and then do the same thing. It is not worth the trouble."
3,Not updated with Daylight Savings Time,"I like this clock for about 11 months of the year. Unfortunately it didn't get the update when Congress decided Daylight Savings Time should start earlier and end later, so outside of the traditional DST schedule it's great. It sets itself quickly and keeps time well. I do blame Congress for causing the clock's problems, but the clock suffers because of the actions of Congress (though don't we all?)."
1,Does Not Correctly Adjust For New 2007 DST Dates,"I received this clock as a Christmas gift in 2005. If you had asked me what I thought of it in 2006, I would have said - great! But that all changed in 2007 when I found out it did not correctly change time for DST. I live in the eastern time zone.The ""fix"" given below basically takes the clock out of radio controlled mode and puts it into manual quartz clock mode. Which means at the next DST change, I'll have to manually reset the time again.Wait a minute!?! That's one of the reasons I wanted a radio controlled clock - to automatically (and on the correct date) change itself into and out of DST. If it won't do that, then all I have is a very expensive quartz wall clock.I cannot recommend this clock at all!"
1,Sharp does not care!,"Based on this clock's inability to change to DST, unlike the other five atomic clocks I own, and due to the Sharp website not even acknowledging that they make or made this clock... And due to the bogus, always busy 'help' number on the back of the clock, I would strongly recommend NOT purchasing this clock. For that matter, carefully research any potential Sharp purchase to ascertain that they will support it!!"
1,DST not working,"It does not appear this clock is compatible with the new Daylight Savings Time changes.If you are is the Eastern Time zone, do not buy this item."
2,Did not adjust to new daylight savings time,"I concur with other reviewer. The clock did not automatically adapt to the revised daylight savings time and I couldn't find any way to adjust it manually. Another ""atomic clock"" I have (GE 5805ACT3) corrected itself without problems. I guess we have to wait a few weeks before this clock reads correctly again!"
1,Since when was Geddy Lee in an emo band?!,"Things like this are exactly why I don't like today's music...first it's bands like the Darkness or Jet are bringing the '80s back when they're really doing nothing but ripping off bands from that time and getting more recognition for it now than those bands do. Now back to this...as you all know, Geddy Lee is the lead singer of Rush. So why the hell does the singer of this band sound exactly the same?! For christ sakes, have some originality. This is why today's music isn't any good. Always ripping off people one way or another. Explain to me what is so special about this. Tell the singer to develop his own sound instead of stealing someone elses."
1,Another voice,"Stunning?! (Shakes head sadly) Thank the Lord that Classic Rock is still alive and thriving! I've just listened to samples by Thrice and Atreyu...and this is much better than them, but falls way short of ""stunning!"" At least it has a semblence of melody and structure, but the singer sounds like an adolescent. Not for me!"
5,Incredible Record,"As a huge Coheed and Cambria fan, I was overjoyed at the news that they were re-releasing their first record on a limited edition green vinyl. For the price and being able to pre-order it, I got it the day it was available and couldn't wait to receive it. When I did, i was astounded at the vinyl. It is an awesome collectors item and I would really recommend it to any fan of the band. They have other vinyl available and comics and lots of cool things as well, so check those out! And if you don't know this band, look them up and give them a chance. This band, as well as the music being phenomenal, does a lot for their fans."
4,good stuff.,"this album is really good. its interesting. not boring. the singer has a unique voice. there is a little screaming but not much. id say its a mix of emo and prog rock. ""everything evil"" is my favorite track. if you like sunny day real estate i recomend this album to you."
3,Not sure,"I haven't bought this cd yet but i have 3 songs on mp3... ""Everythig evil"" ""delirium trigger"" and ""time consumer"" and i love them! I don't know why ppl have a problem with cladio's voice.... I thinks its really unique, i like it alot. next time i get out to a store i will deffanately be buying this cd."
2,better than most of the trash being passed off as emo,"now, i could trash the vocals, which it seems, is a common complaint. but i wont, because i can tollerate them. i would even go so far as to say they fit with some of the songs.coheed and cambria's main problem lies in an obvious identity crisis. are they incredibly talented muscicians in an emo band ala joan of arc, or someone equally as complex like the owls? on that arm they could even be in a prog-rock band. or are they in a pop punk band? what these guys have failed to realize is that complex moving compositions do not have room for pop choruses. it disrupts the flow and often ruins entire songs. i find myself listening to the intro to time consumer only to turn it off once it hits the chorus.it's unfortunate that a talented bunch have for some reason decided to absolutely ruin a would be incredible album with cheesy new found glory-esque choruses in order to appeal to a broader range of people."
2,Overly ambitious,"2 1/2Well you can't fault the official debut from C&C; for a lack of trying. Nearly every track is riddled with overindulgences, primarily on the vocal front but as a result of the pop-punk-progressive fused mentalities as well. Tis a shame, because one can sense with a little more tightening and focus the band could really successfully straddle the line between pop and prog."
4,this is one good album.,"This is a good one to get!Some versions of this album have enhanced or bonus 1-track song of ""Elf Tower, New Mexico"" which is a good song - 6min long!Also 1st album ""The Penelope EP"" dated 1999 is a good rare album to get!!! 2nd album ""The Second Stage Turbine Blade"" good!3rd album ""In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3"" SUCKS skip it!!The 4th album ""Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star, Volume One: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness"" is so good!!!"
2,concept albums?who cares,"i was really stoked for this album but man it is hard to listen to.The main reason it's so hard to listen to is because (well it seems to me anyways)is that these guys can't make a song with one direction.While that can be enchanting, coheed and cambria do it in a sort of disheartening way.My example of this is in the semi-fantastic devil in new jersey.This song is absolutely explosive at first and it's all good in the chorus when he's singing about josephine,but then it stops.And you hear, ""don't let them scare you"" and it goes into this painful section of the song about a bleeding [guy] with overdone guitarwork. I only give this release two stars because i don't get anything out of it almost at all.but it's still okay.one thing that really irks me is the little kid voice this dude keeps using.someone needs to tell that guy to grow up."
3,Bizarre Lyrics,"This is the first CD I have listened to of theirs.I like the overall sound. It sounds a bit like Rush.I opened up the included pamphlet to look at the songsand noticed when I started reading the lyrics that theymake no sense. Half the time they are not even sentences,and despite that, there is no flow of story throughout the song.Just incohesive ramblings. It's the most bizarre thing I'veever seen. So if you like their sound, and aren't much intopaying attention to words to songs, then this album might befine for you, otherwise it might just drive you crazy!"
2,?,"whenever i listen to and coheed and cambria it reminds me of sitting in my friends room with him riffing out to a copy in the cd player. i didnt like the first album as much as the second, but i still really have no interest in this style of music. plus his voice annoys me."
2,Blah,"I don't know about you guys, but I think they ruined the songs in the enhanced version... It sounds like they're trying too hard or something.Although I did like the acoustic version of Junesong Provision and Elf Tower."
5,They better not break up!,"After ATDI broke up I extensively searched for a band I could get to the same level of liking with. My search took me through Thursday, Finch, Recover, Taking back Sunday, poison the well, Thrice and many many more similar bands..........This site was actually the tool I needed to find what I was looking for. The fact that you guys also bought this album are the reason I have a favorite band again cus I found Co & Ca by pilaging through pages of ""People who bought this album also bought...."" They are not as Hardcore as ATDI were but the vocals are simply amazing and his range is unbelieveable as he switches back and forth between Coheed's words to Cambria's word's. One of the few Cd's I can just put in and listen to all the tracks and have no real preference on which to hear. Can't wait for the next CD and they better not break up on me.Sometimes there aren't enuff Stars but 5 will have to do."
5,The Second Stage Turbine Blade,"Coheed and Cambria is greatest band of all time. They pour out endless emotions and bizarre lyrics. The guitar breakdowns are amazing and the vocals are beautiful. To add icing to the cake they even based the band on a story written by the singer, Claudio Sanchez. It's a dark sci-fi story starting with the two lead characters, Coheed and Cambria. Each song tells a part of this epic story. The Second Stage Turbine Blade encompasses the beginning of this tale, but interpreting the story is extremely hard. Thats why Claudio is releasing graphic novels/comics to easier explain the story. Well anyways, Coheed and Cambria is an amazing band, The Second Stage Turbine Blade is a must buy. I recomend you buy it before In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3.xx"
5,Best Band Ever,This CD is stunning. Everything about it is perfect.The music is haunting AND uplifting due to Coheed And Cambria's complexity of their songs where one song will often go through several variations in mood. The lyrics are original and they are all part of a story (Which is being told in comic books published by Evil Ink) written by the band's frontman Claudio Sanchez. I don't even need to talk about Claudio's impressive vocal range that just speaks for itself. Seriously if you don't already own this album go buy it NOW!
4,The best band you've never heard of,This cd is awsome i love the whole thing. The best song has to be Devil in Jersey city. I saw them live and they were so full of energy. They are probably one of the best live bands i've heard in a long time.
4,not a typical listener,"I am a classic rock fan but my boyfriend is a die hard fan of bands such as Saves the Day, The Get up Kids, and Weezer. He introduced me to Coheed and Cambria and I was surprised to find that the singer's voice sounds similar to that of the lead singer in the classic rock band Rush. This band is full of power and flavor, and I especially like the song ""Time Consumer."" Good cd, even for people that don't normally listen to music of this type such as myself."
3,Tres,Wow; the prog thing is cool I guess... but what's this....? Who's annoying voice is this?! HOW DID DR. KNOW GET ON HERE!? Rush? Never heard of'em.
1,"""the active ingredients are homeopathic""",LOLthere are no active ingredients in homeopathic medicinethis should be put in another category separate from real medicine.
1,Craaap!,"I mistakenly purchased this movie based on the preview, which seemed like a pretty good premise. I wasn't expecting Academy Award winning performances but I wasn't prepared for the juvenile crap it promotes. I like a good 'The Fast and the Furious', and films like it which are in it for the hype, are fairly well made and generally are not promising to be much more than that. I know what to expect, fair is fair. But 'Crank', I think, falls far short. It does have it's moments but if you intend to get this movie try to get it at a rock bottom price. $3, $4 at most. It's for those times when you and your buds get together, the beer and pizza, buzz, etc, are going, and you feel like watching something really moronic for as long as you can stand it!"
4,Good little action movie,"This movie was what id expect- a nonstop action movie with little value. Jason Statham is a great action star in my eyes. He was great in The Transporter and is a highly enjoyable movie series. Id recommend this movie to people who like action movies, but dont look for a meanings. Also check out the Transporter series."
3,More comedy than action!!!,If you are looking for an action movie like Transporter then this one is NOT for you!!Don't expect cool action scenes like Transporter because this one doesn't have a great choreoghraphy and there are more comedy scenes than action scenes!P.S: Don't let the cover fool you!Adios.
3,Guilty Pleasure,"Crank is just one of those movies that you either love or hate. A guilty pleasure for me. Think of the Transporter movies done the right way, meaning, stupid in an artistic and surreal sense and over the top action that seems more like a video game than a cartoon, if that makes any sense to you. Anyway, definitely worth renting."
5,Awesome if you know what to expect,"This is an action movie that does not take itself too seriously. It is NOT ""Transporter 3."" At all times it is juvenile, a little sexist, and completely over the top. If you want nonstop action, some hilarious scenes, and did I say nonstop action then this is a great movie."
1,Stupid Movie - waste of time watching.,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Actually I turned it off after the first 30 minutes because it was so dumb. My brother convinced me to finish it because he said it got better. Well it didn't, it got worse. Nothing but violence, sex, and drugs. All action and no plot. The sex scene in the middle of China Town with a bus load of kids watching was the stupidest thing they could of put in the movie. Don't waste your time watching this!!!"
3,"Fun movie, good effects and sound.",I don't think this was a great movie but it was enjoyable and fun. Nice surround soundtrack and some good effects.
1,You would have a hard time finding a worse movie.,"I got this movie assuming it would be bad, but hoped for entertaining and bad... or even funny and bad... but this movie was neither. It was simply bad. The soundtrack was unbearable, the cinematography will make a normal person nauseous, and the plot line was more than likely written by a drunk, stoned 17-year-old. If you plan to make it through more than 15 minutes of this film, you will also need to be heavily drugged or intoxicated. Best of luck to the brave who attempt."
3,1.21 Jigawatts,"As close as you can get to a live-action Popeye cartoon - poisoned hitman Jason Statham has to keep his adrenaline flowing full-stop as he searches for an antidote or he'll die. Cartoon violence galore, but frequently witty and has fleeting moments (like, two) of actual sweetness. Sounds like a splitting headache and almost is, but utterly sold me on its crazed premise and bizarre worldview. Also does its thing and wraps it up in 80 minutes."
4,Great man movie!,"Man, I was impressed with this movie because it breaks a lot of rules of film making. Amazing fast paced camera work. Intense action yet there are a lot more laughs than Stratham movies usually have. The movie is an excellent execution of a good plot device. The graphic treatments, editing, and sound design all contributed to the fun, modern adrenaline pumping fun of the movie.It good to see some woman on this site don't take offense to this movie.This may not rank as one of the best films of the year, but it certainly will be one of the most entertaining! If you love action, if you love comedy, if you love drug humor and gratuitous nudity, and if you want people to just get to the point, then Crank delivers on all levels and then some! All action fans and interest should see this one."
4,As advertised,Movie credit from another purchase used to rent movie. Good price. Laptop computer hook to HD TV to watch the movie. Check out the movie reviews prior to renting.
4,An excellent action packed movie,"This movie is action packed from start to finish. It is very fast moving and the stunts are unbelievable. Jason Statham is an outstanding actor and fits very well in action movies. He is very sexy and does deliver a couple of ""backside and bare chest"" shots in this one. This is one movie that will have both Jason's and your adrenaline raised from start to finish. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves ""high action and fast moving"" movies alike."
3,So so,"I don't agree that if you like ""The Professional"" and ""Run Lola Run"" that you will like this movie. It just didn't hold my interest, whereas the aforementioned films did. No real connection to characters, just a lot of fast and furious movement. Not a new concept either. It's been done before, and better."
4,Poison in his veins. Vengeance in his heart.,"A hit man (Statham) learns that a poison injected into his body will kill him if his heart rate drops too much. Now he must exact his revenge on the people who injected him before he takes his last breathCrank is a violent, funny, cheesy, fun entertianing ride that is original and unique. There were some fantastic shots like the last lines of the film, and there are some great shots like the prespective of subtitles from the other person. It was just great, I had fun watching it, and the audience did too. It is sort of what Snakes On A Plane wants to be because this is good campy, b-movie fun right here."
1,Popcorn& bubble gum film,"Strictly for teenie boppers who know nothing about movies! Maybe ""Crank 2"" is better!? Statham was better in ""the Expendables""Good Point: Received fast & in perfect condition from Amazon!"
2,Not much to recommend,"I like several others had high hopes for this movie. Jason Statham is awesome, and Amy Smart is usually very good, so I thought this would be a winner.The most annoying aspect to me was the way the camera jumped around, and went into this fast forward, jerky mode. That coupled with the music gave me quite a headache. I understand it was all meant to mimic the racing heart of the ""hero"" but it was really overdone.The action was not on par with the Transporter movies, and the humor was not on par with Snatch.The plot was rather confusing, why was he poisoned again? You don't really end up caring about any of the characters, which made it hard to get into the movie.Overall this was a disappointment, any other of Jason Statham's movies would be a better pick."
4,Rock n Rolla,"""Crank"" is directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. Chelios (Jason Statham) is a hitman who has been injected with a drug that will stop his heart, and the only way to fight the drug is to maintain a high level of adrenaline. Chelios then goes on a rampage hunting down the gangsters who did this to him. This film has a frenetic style of fast clips, and an almost montage style of filmmaking that reminded me somewhat of Oliver Stone's film ""Natural Born Killers"". Everything about the film is geared towards a hyper-realism. This is a brilliant film that never slows down. Buckle up!This film is presented with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and in 7.1 PCM Audio (uncompressed) or 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX Audio in English with Spanish subtitles. The soundtrack is loud and clear and one of the best to test your system with. Crank was filmed with high definition cameras and its high clarity images and knock out color and contrast reflect this."
3,"Not to be taken seriously - lots of fun if you ""get it""...","When I saw this in the movies, I was ready to walk out within the first 3 minutes. I thought it was THE worst movie I'd ever seen...But then, it ""clicked"" for me...This is a spoof, a send-up, a tongue in cheek kind of movie. And as soon as that dawned on me, I really started enjoying the movie.It takes a LOT of chances, cinematically. And as long as you get that this movie is supposed to be FUN and not to be taken seriously, it's well worth watching.Not a classic by any means, but a good time and worth watching."
4,Hard To Fault Statham,"Much like 'Lady in the Water', 'Crank' is a movie that relies on the lead actor to sell you on what is happening in the film. Statham does just this; And while alot of this movie can be seen as silly and at times needless, the filmakers stick to their guns and see it through. I enjoyed alot of the parts in this movie; there were alot of innovative camera techniques and some tight editing; lots of comic carnage involving meat cleavers and hand grenades; I thought the Amy Smart stuff(while I do appreciate her, don't get me wrong)treaded too much on the comical side for me, but Statham is so fun to watch anyways that it was a minor distraction. My only complaint is that I wondered what this movie would have been like if they had just tweaked the tone a little more to the darker side...more of a Salton Sea-ish intensity, perhaps...Still, this was a fun movie with some memorable stuff in an often forgettable genre."
5,Very fun party movie!,"This movie is not a serious action flick. It's a silly comedy/action that uses low budget special effects which reminds you not to take the film seriously. You don't have to pay attention to the plot; you can drink beers and talk to your buddies throughout the whole thing and not get lost. If you like to laugh at action, drugs, sex, and violence, this is a good film for you."
3,Average American Action Movie,"I give this 3 stars, because while it does a good job being what it wants to, it's not really to my taste. To my taste its 2 stars or less, however fans of action films along the lines of the Fast and the Furious or Domino will get a sure kick out of this.The movie tries its hardest to be the most cliche guy movie possible, razor thin plot, action for the sake of action, attitude spewing lines of macho dialogue that come off as incredbly silly, and of course a whole of ton of bad acting. So while overall, the movie is very, very dumb, it doesn't want to be anything else, and succeeds with flying colors.I'll have to admit i'm disapointed with main actor Jason Statham, i've seen Snatch so I know the man can act. So I hope he goes back to film's such as that instead of forgetable flicks that no one will remember in 5 years like Crank."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"This is not a movie, it's a video game. Obviously these directors were spending way too much time playing 'Grand Theft Auto'. Mindless, plot-less and pointless."
3,Crank,"This movie had some potential but the language is worse than what I hear in my maintenance shop every day. I'm not sure what the director was thinking when he released a movie with such brutal language. It really isn't necessary.The movie itself seems to have a plot that's a bit far-fetched, but it is somewhat believable. The main character has been injected with a poison and has an hour or so to live (or find an antidote). The result is a trail of blood and destruction.At times the soundtrack also grated on my nerves, I guess modern headbanger music is not my thing. The sounds also were rather obnoxious at times.All in all I really don't recommend this movie. There were some interesting points, but those that I disliked far outweighed the good."
3,"Action, fun and original, for Pulp Fiction fans...","When the film began, I had the intention to stop it after five minutes.But it turns to be a good movie, original by the way it is filmed.Good action and many funny part in it. I would say that this film is in the same mood that ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"""
2,Don't waste your time,certain scenes of sexual nature were very disturbing. I would think writers could think of better ways to past the time.
4,REAL OR CRAZY ENTERTAINMENT,"This is not a documentary but an adrenaline-fueled ride called entertainment. Many of the things that happen in the movie are totally pure fiction, and do not try to apply logic to most of the scenes. It is a hard-core action movie meant to entertain and take you away for a few hours from our regular, routine existence. I liked Jason and Amy in this flick. Chev Chelios is one wild and crazy dude. Does he survive? - You have to watch to find out."
1,not my kind of movie,A friend recommended this movie just was not good. Could be that it is just not my kind of movie and the friend likes this kind of crap.
5,Perfect recipe for an action movie,"Crank has everything you desire in an action film; its fast paced and there is sex, drugs, violence, and some explosions. Its funny and I love Jason statham"
1,Crank,"Probably one of the biggest wastes of money I have ever endured. Built for the new generation of Couch Potato who has not been outside the house into reality. It got One Star from me because there wasnt anything lower.I like Jason Stathams acting in other movies but this was way over the line, not his fault, Im sure the check cashed."
3,crankit,"it was not as expected.The other movies of this actor ( The transporter, Transporter 2 & 3 ) are 100% better."
3,Crank dvd,The movie was a litle more crude than I thought it would be. This movie is an adult only movie.
3,HUH?,"Again, I know this is supposed to be one of Jason Statham's better movies - highly touted but I just really didn't get it!"
2,Not what I expected,"Well, I've had high high hopes for this movie as I really liked Jason Statham in Transporter series and Italian Job which were actually very good action movies. While I was hoping to see a similar type of movie, I had to watch one these new trendy absurd movies which reminds me a bit of Pulp Fiction. Sometimes it's too realistic and too violent but mostly very stupid. I really thought that the guy was dreaming or something when he made a call with his cellphone while he was falling from a helicopter."
2,must watch...ONCE!,"like the title says, watch it once and it makes a great action movie, but after that..it'll juz be sittin on ur shelf, gathering dust.rent it. not worth buying.peace"
2,"Is That Ephedrine Under Your Gown, Or Are You Just Happy To See Me? ~ When Adrenaline Is All You Have To Keep You Going","Synopsis: Professional killer is injected with a rare Asian poison and is left with an hour or so to find a cure and kill those responsible. Talk about having a busy day on your schedule.Recently released `Crank' ('06) plays like a low budget Indie film utilizing angular, avante-garde inspired shooting angles and rapid camera movement to create the illusion of compressed time and drug-induced mania. Add to that a loud, pounding, high octane soundtrack that's all over the musical map and you have the makings of a film in a genre all its own. You'll either love it, or hate it. I fall into the latter.Definitely outrageous and original, `Crank' had loads of potential and the right leading man (Jason Statham) to try and pull it of, however it just didn't quite work for me. One viewing is more than enough for this one."
1,Really bad,"Even though I think that Jason Statham is an awesome performer, (See Transporter and Transporter II) and Amy Smart is absolutely gorgeous, their combined talents and looks couldn't save this turkey! This movie was so bad, as soon as I finished watching it, I gave it away!"
4,Non-stop adrenaline and laughs,"The plot is very simple: someone gets poisoned, is later told about it and sets out on an unusual journey of revenge. They did a surprisingly good job at creating a movie out of that simple plot: the non-stop action, ironies and laughs keep your interest throughout. Even if this isn't your typical flick, you'll enjoy the ride. Just be prepared for high-adrenaline (pun intended)."
4,Mind Sugar,"Yes, it's an obscenely ridiculous sugar-rush of a ride, but ""Crank"" is the #1 action film of the decade. The cinematography is so over-the-top hyperactive, aggressive and stylish that it overcomes the preposterous plotline to the point where the lack of story means nothing and the action is all-consuming. Speaking as a film snob who hates 99% of modern action flicks, this is the only time I can remember a movie successfully accomplishing this. It's also helpful that Jason Statham, star of the ""Transporter"" films, has the best ""I don't give a f@!k about anything"" attitude in contemporary, dare I use the word, cinema, and is able to convey his sweaty, literal adrenalin rush to the screen and into your blood. The movie is definitely junk food for the mind, but it sure tastes good going down. Remember to take your epinephrine."
3,Crank,"When I first saw this movie Crank, I though it was kind of stupid and wasn't worth it, that's because I only saw half of the movie. Then the second time when I watched from the beginning to the end I thought it was ok I'll give the movie about 3 1/2 stars. The scenes I enjoyed watching was when Chev was in the cab and the radio was playing ""Achky breaky heart"". I didn't like the Chinatown scene, they could have did away with that scene, I think the directors went a little to far with that."
1,"STINK, STANK, STUNK!","If I could have given zero stars for this movie, I would have. I actually feel dumb for wasting my time even talking about it.The movie aspires to be a cross between ""Speed"" and ""Escape From New York"", but doesn't come anywhere near as entertaining as either one. If you like stupid movies, well, you won't find one any stupider."
1,Crank Not Even Worth 1 Star,"Do not see this movie what a horrible movie the story is just plain stupid I mean it had a good idea about him being poisoned and the only way to stay alive is by keeping is adrenalin up, but after seeing the movie the execution of that storyline is just plain ridiculous you sit watching that movie for the 83 minutes and you wonder what the hell is the point of movie. I would advise do not waste your money on this movie and if you decide to see this movie good luck."
2,over the line,"The characters are interesting, the action is entertaining and creative in spots, and the plot was acceptably predictable (except the 1-hour-to-live deadline.) I'm sad and disappointed that whoever allowed this flick to go public thought that the sexual aspects of the action (the Chinatown incident) and some of the crude cartoon-language were titillating and funny. I found them pre-juvenile and pathetic. I've lost respect for Statham as an otherwise fine peformer and Lionsgate as a provider for accepting that trash as morally acceptable. On the assumption that Crank 2 and 3 are more of the same, I'll spend my money elsewhere. I encourage parents to see this flick before deciding whether their kids should see the series."
3,fast moving like transporter,"it was fast moving like transporter it had a lot of far fetch wild action but to me i flt it was missing a few things th movi went at such a fast pase some scenes was movign sof ast it hurts your eyes, and i wish it was atad bit longer but if you like transporter type movies you'lll probably like this one"
2,A bit too much...,Purchased because I enjoyed the Transporter movie series. This movie is very different and a lot more vulgar. I had to get rid of this movie because the language was just too much. It was a waste of money.
4,"Interesting premise, good execution","This is a non-stop action film, where, somewhat like the movie ""Speed,"" Statham has to keep going at full speed in order to keep bad things from happening. It's an interesting premise, and the execution is very good. If sheer, fun escapism is what you're looking for, this flick would be a good choice."
5,CRANK,"A thrilling action movie that doesn't leave you disappointed.I saw trailers for the sequel on about every LionsGate DVD, so itcaught my attention every time. So I decided to rent the first one firstand it was amazing. I bought the CRANK 1 & 2 Pack on DVD on eBay for less than$8, and it was worth it! The movies are action pack and funny. It wasby far one the best action movies of all time."
4,Action! Action! Action!,"My husband insisted that I watch this movie with him, so I did. Chev has been drugged and the only way he can save his own life is to keep his adrenalin high and does he ever do it. How? By driving at fast speeds in crowded areas, getting in fight after fight and just acting totally insane every minute, just to stay alive. Definitely an action, fast paced movie and actually one that once I got involved in the story I ended up enjoying. Definitely different,and that is a good thing."
4,OK.............But ?,"Good action movie, and funny in parts. But just cant fathom the Ideaof Chevy ""The Transporter"" having anybody or anything beat him.Hated the ending> Would have been better if he has beat the bad guysand found an antedote."
1,Too far out of date to be useful,"SuperCard is alive and well (<http://www.supercard.us/>), but unfortunately nobody's written any books about it lately. But not to worry: if you have experience with HyperCard, you'll have very little trouble picking up SuperCard (and you can convert your old stacks to truly sexy OSX applications!)...and if not, well, this is probably the best combination of power and ease of use around, and the included docs are excellent. Sure beats VB and REALbasic! Just remember, it's Mac-only.Andy Baird"
3,Corrections,"Just to correct and update some of the author's notes:1) SuperCard has now been sold to InkWell and Allegiant Software is closed, and,2) There has NEVER (repeat NEVER) been a Windows version of SuperCard. There is a web browser plug-in called Roadster that allows SuperCard projects to play over the web regardless of platform, but it is still in beta only and works only about 5% of the time."
4,3 year-old loves it,My grand-daughter loves this doll. She is into the hair thing and this is perfect for her. Even the adults who see this are fascinated by the changing hair color. Great buy!
3,Not as easy as advertised.,"I purchased this doll from Amazon as a Christmas present for my daughter. The commercials made the hair changing aspect appear easy enough. But it's not. I threw out the instructions and box, so I don't recall exactly how to reverse the hair color. I think it has to be wet or something. Also, only a small portion of the bangs change color. And the hair has to be pressed pretty firmly. So, unless your child is a Cabbage Patch fanatic, I'd stick with a regular one. It's not so simple for a 6 year old to use."
4,Lupin's Classroom from LEGO,"(...)If YOU'VE read the third HP book,you know who Lupin,Neville,and what a boggart is.This set is cool because youget a great setting for mini lego adventures.(I USE THE SKULLS TO MAKE EVIL ZOMBIE SOILDERS!!!)This set is great with The marauder's map set.See ya!!!"
5,i love all of it it is the BEST,i love it i think it is 1 of the best lego sets made it has new peaple has a lot of cool peaces and it has a good look 2 it u no i looks very cool up 2 he rest of all the harry potter legos and i have almost 90% of them!!!
5,Combination of Lego items,"I purchased, for a grandchild, two Lego kits: Lego Harry Potter Professor Lupin's Classroom - 4752 and Harry Potter Lego the Dueling Club Set 4733. My grandson was very pleased with them."
3,Not a set,"From the picture and the way it states ""these candles,"" I thought I was ordering a set, but I only got one candle. I'm not disappointed at all with the candle, and now, looking back, I can see on the page that this is only one candle; however, I thought I should leave a comment stating that this is only one candle to help clear up anyone else's confusion. Other than the fact that I was a little let down it was not a set, the candle is great. It is one of the strongest smelling candles I've ever had. You really don't even have to burn it if you just want subtle scent; you can just leave the lid off of the jar."
1,terrible,"as an alcoholic in early recovery, i have been buying many books that pertain to alcoholism over the past few months. hiding behind a pseudonym, the author prescribes a program of exercise, pharmaceuticals, and nutritional supplements as a way to turn alcoholics into 'normal' drinkers. i have no idea how this book even made it to print."
1,Don't bother....,"From what I know, one is either an alcoholic or not. Alcoholics will not benefit from this book (please go and attend AA), while alcohol-lovers, please see Weight Watchers. It's the same principle: nobody is going to supply you with the will power, just like dieting and losing weight: you are either determined to do it or not and no supplements/regimes in the world are going to achieve this for you. ""Backed by a physician"", as the title says...hell, I can have my method backed by a physician: ""drink/eat less and exercise more"". It's not easy, but it's simple and does not cost you a fortune."
5,My way out,Well written and to the point. A good alternative for those who have not embraced AA. Glad to have ordered it.
1,DO NOT BUY,This book is nothing but a short booklet telling you why you should buy her $500 hypnosis CD set. There is barely any inspirational story at all behind it! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
2,not likely to help,"Unfortunately, this book/site will work for very very few problem drinkers and or users. Some of the people on the blogs are drinking as they are typing.The problem is there is no way to tell if the people your ""typing"" to are real, and there is NO ACCOUNTABILITY!If this works for you then I say Great and Congrats, but people struggling to find help for themselves or loved ones will find this just does not work. Try AA or other LOCAL programs that are out there,"
1,Completely Irresponsible and dangerous!,"No wonder this woman used a pseudonym, she should be ashamed!I don't care if this so called ""program"" worked for her, it is NOTHING: just some prescription drugs and hypnosis.(she even tells the reader how to get ""iffy"" pharmaceuticals from India off of the internet )People die from this disease, she has the gall to offer this as a solution, and then follow up withthe grad finale of ""drinking in moderation"". Really??I can't even return it for a refund, I wouldn't want anyone else to read it.Into the fireplace..."
1,Made me feel ill,"I bought the drugs mentioned in this book from an indian pharmacy, there was no chance my GP would prescribe them. They do make you want to stop drinking but they make you feel even worse than you do if you down a bottle of vodka a night so what is the point. You are better off with Control Alcohol (Stop Drinking Now) by Craig Beck"
4,"Good, but not great","When Time FadesThe Silvery ImageSee my review of Suspyre's ""When Time Fades"". The CD's all come from the same cookie cutter, just with a slightly different shape."
3,Overdone,This is good power metal but it becomes a bit boring in places. Not because they perform the same chords over and over because they don't. This band tries to do the rock opera thing with power metal I believe and it doesn't turn out that great. The vocalist needs some work if he's to try a rock opera type CD again. The players are great. Maybe as a whole they'll do better in the future.
5,OKAY WOW!!!!!! NIGHTMARE RECORDS DID IT AGAIN,"Yes I am a big fan of Nightmare Records artist, and why????? They never fail to deliever the goods, and Suspyre now joins those ranks. Their new CD ""The Great Divide"" is in one word AWESOME!!!!!!!!! This, their sophomore effort is head and shoulders above any release so far for 2007, it combines the driving guitars and keys and melodic vocals that they are know for, but on a more professional level. Where can they go now??? If this is any indication then they have their whole future ahead of them. Buy this CD NOW you will not be disappointed at all."
1,heaven help us,"will this crap never go away? this song is VERY annoying, just like lady sov herself. save your money and ears by NOT buying this."
5,Excellent for Medical Transcriptionists,"I bought this book as a supplement to the education I received to become a medical transcriptionist. It was very useful as well while I was studying for my certification. The material is laid out in a clear and logical manner, and the glossary in the back is excellent. I found the CD to be good reenforcement of the material in the book."
4,Good for medical transcriptionists;All body systems complete,I used this book to learn medical terminology for my career in medical transcription. This book was excellent for that use. Fairfax Cty. Adult Ed. uses this as its text for Medical Terminolgy. The disks in the back are helpful too; assist a person with pronounciation of terms.
4,"CD not for Mac, but FABULOUS text!","I just purchased this book, and I am thus far thrilled with the natural flow of learning this terminology. The book is well organized. Unfortunately, I cannot get the CD to work, nor can I access the website listed. I have Mac OS X operating system, which is likely the problem. Otherwise, great book!P.S. I have used the software now on a PC, and it is wonderful! The quizzes and self-study guides are exactly what I needed to truly master the material, and it is fun!"
2,"Slow, slow, slow......","I have not finished this book yet. I have picked it up three times attempting to engross myself in it, but it is an extremely slow read. Therefore, I can not give it a high recommendation. I am disappointed in the book!"
2,Good while it lasted,The card worked great until it died. I'm super bummed because they are really hard to get help from once it dies. My computer is unusable now and they won't get back to me .Sad situation especially since the G5 tower only works with a few video cards.
2,Bad Description,"The product description does not tell you that this machine will not work with a water filtraton system. It has a water level probe that picks up on the impurities in the water to determine water level. As a result the machine will start by itself and will not shut off. Get the mop out, you will need it...Oh, and Bunn, Clark the distributor and webstaurantstore.com where I purchased the maker will not exchange it."
5,Vampire Knight volume 3,This is an awesome series that I just LOVE. Ages over 14. Can't wait to get the second series and I wish they would make more. It's just a awesome storyline with so many twists and turns! Great entertainment.
4,The real drama begins here,"As we continue one of the most popular serise in the world of anime, it is the 3rd vol. that the fears and secrets of Yuki, Zerro, and Kaname begin to unfold. The world of humans and vampires begins to spiral into a self procamed battle it seems, by the three individuals. but that was just how I seeemed to portray these episodes. I know im not making much sence but your best just getting it yourselves.I still refuse to watch the english version, even if I know the voice actors. They just don't fit the characters >( And as always, the characters are supper hot. All the same...I'm waiting to get payed so I may continue my collection."
2,Top open not closed as expected,Shipping and all that is fine.The top of the pick is open design and has some handle exposed at the top of it making that if you hit into rock it can split the handle. The handle at the neck is also very light and looks to be easily broken.I have not used this item yet and these are only observations of the product from first look.
4,good quality,Its a pick axe. Good quality. It works and is just like the photo. What more do you need to know. It did however take a while to be delivered (so that knocked off a star). Took about two weeks to get here under standard shipping. Usually my Amazon orders come much faster.
5,Pro Digger,I searched for a long time for a quality pick like this. I metal detect in Southern Illinois and the ground has been almost like concrete. The pick I had been useing had been broken and welded several times and just could not stand up to the soil conditions. This is the first pick that has stood up to all my digging requirements! I love it.[...]
1,Do not waste your money,There is no way of recording repeating events. Why would they even sell a radio recorder that you can't even schedule repeating radio programs? Then of course they make about four other programs that do almost the same thing. And of course one of their other programs does have a repetive scheduler. Give me a brake can't these software companies make one good program instead of ten lousy programs. The same crazy strategy that Magix uses. I have emailed them many times and have not gotten one response
2,Not what I expected,"This watch was definetly not what I expected. First, it was bigger and thicker than what I expected for a women's watch; Second, to heavy; Third to expensive for what you get in return."
4,Works for me - sorta,"I bought this watch several months ago. It worked for a while then stopped. So, it remained in the drawer for several months. I then took it to a watch repair shop. All it needed was a new battery. Since then, it's worked perfectly. I get comments on it all the time. It is slightly too big for my small wrist, but I just let it dangle just above my hand like a bracelet. Four stars because I'll have to get a link removed to get a snugger fit."
4,Supportive,"These lumbar support cushions are very supportive, it is a tried and true shape that still does what it should."
5,Just what I needed to learn more...,"In doing my Bible reading, I was amazed with the prophet Elisha and all of his God-given gifts. I wanted to learn more. So I went to Amazon and found this book. It was perfect in giving me what I was looking for and filling in the gaps of Elisha's life and his walk with God."
1,Dap is Worthless,"The package states that the sealant cures in 24 hours and can be exposed to water at that point. After applying this, I waited 36 hours before taking a shower. As the previous reviewer stated, the sealant turned to mush. I had to dig it all out again and start from scratch. This is the second Dap product I have bought for bathroom use, and they are both worthless. I am never buying a Dap product again.In my limited home-improvement experience, I have found that nothing compares to silicone for water resistance in the bathroom. Uncured silicone has a more liquid consistency than acrylic-based products, so it's a little harder to work with, but it dries on time and is durable. GE makes a fast-drying bath/shower silicone that works well. I used it to replace this Dap garbage."
1,Disappointing DAP Kwik Seal experience,I gave DAP Kwik Seal Kitchen & Bath Adhesive Caulk a 1 star rating only because there was no option for a lower rating. I had the same experience as others. There is nothing more frustrating than applying an expensive product according to instructions and having it turn to mush with the first shower. This product should be recalled by the company. It's worthless.
1,"Waste of time, money and effort!","I used this caulk between my tub and tile. After carefully scraping off all the old caulk, cleaning the area twiceand letting it dry before applying the caulk. I waited over 24 hours to let the caulk cure before using the shower and after a few uses of the shower the caulk was completely dissolved in some spots and mushy and soft where it remained.Only buy this product if you like doing jobs twice or if you never plan on using your tub/shower ever again.I recommend you go with GE silicone caulk. It was dry within 8 hours (as promised) and isn't dissolving with first contact with water."
1,Dap is Cr*p,"As other people had put it in my shower, followed the instructions and after one use it started coming off. What a mess! Customer support said to send it back, well that won't probably cover shipping and nothing for all my labor."
1,Wrong Item?,"I was expecting the item described which I thought would include 3 discs and vocal music but received ""Greatest Praise Songs of the Church Instrumental"" and only one disc."
3,Excelent cables slow delivery,"The quality of these cables is exemplary, I bought 2 for my new case and they run at 3gbs as advertised. The only problem I have is that Cyberguys Ships them by snail mail and with the cost you pay for shipping is too high for this for that cost they could have used UPS and I would have gotten them in a reasonable amount of time. That is why the 3 star rating. They took almost 2weeks to get here."
4,Locking clips!,"I bought this here instead of a computer part supplier because it was:A. CheapB. Has locking clips.That said, I want to state that I >HATE< the SATA design.Cheap plastic ends that wear out and wiggle loose, compared to a keyed 40 pin cable that NEVER comes loose?Come on! It's as if they DESIGNED sata to be garbage.Anyway, buy these cables so that some of the hassle and worry will be resolved.They work."
3,"Questionable fit, but it worked.","I had a little bit of trouble with it being loose in the socket. Once I finally made a connection and closed up the computer, I haven't had any problems."
5,Great book - really offers context - recommended for professionals,"This book is really for professionals; I wouldn't recommend my clients read it. I appreciate the perspective it brings to an often too politicized field. In addition, Dr. Gold does an excellent job of *not* blaming but rather using the available literature and the experience at his clinic to endorse ways to help our clients *move on* from their traumatic situations & contexts into a healthier and happier life."
1,Very Amateur DVD,Most of this production could be made in anyone's lounge by blocking off one corner and throwing down a mat on the floor. The models are very average and there seems to have been no direction to pose or perform. I bought this DVD because I already owned two 'Primal' DVDs that had been filmed in the wild outdoors and there is no comparrison in photographic quality. The models there were very hot too. This new DVD was for me a complete wast of time and money. Sorry.
4,I want more of this!,"I liked this!If I wanted to buy fake models faking doing porn, I'd find it free on-line. These are real models, models I've never seen doing porn!But this is nude and natural jocks showing off, just what I like to see. I don't go to school, so I'm not going to see these kind of jocks naked in showers anyway else other than to buy a DVD like this.I want more of this!"
4,Great for adventurous players,I bought this book out of curiosity about how playable an opening the Latvian Gambit is.The answer is:it's risky but worth trying.The book gives extremely in-depth analysis.The only minus is that some of the evaluations are a bit vague.
5,"Exercise your upperbody while feeling strong,sexy & feminine","Wonderful Workout !!! Great Fun!!! Have a Great Time while stengthening and toning your upper body and feel strong, sexy and feminine all at the same time !!! What a combination!!!! Dolphina is a lovely instructor and is NOT at all intimidating... This video is well made, the background is simple, cheery and pleasant and her costumes are lovely but NOT overwelming (you can actually see what she is doing... making it easier to follow ...) and the music has you feeling calm and relaxed all at the same time ;o)... But you can still feel the burn if you aren't tooo distracted by all the fun you are having ...I won't stick with an exercise program if it isn't fun (just being honest ;o) ... ) This one will definantly NOT lie arround collecting dust !! It is worth and the time money!!! I would recommend it! Get it and see for yourself !!!! ENJOY!!! ENJOY!! ENJOY!!!"
3,A good burn for your arms,"This is a nice video for working out your arms on days when you have only 25 minutes to spare. The veil work can easily be done with a light scarf or cloth. Dolphina includes a very brief routine towards the end.The video includes a warm up, two veil technique sections, a routine and a cool down. She shows you how to make an entrance with your veil, some moves that whirl the veil around, footwork to accompany the moves, turns and an arabesque. She assumes that you already know how to do hip circles, hip drops, and shimmies.I would recommend this video for people who are beginners who have some exposure to bellydance and want to add a few more steps to their workout or dance practice."
5,Great Fun Workout,"This video is such a fun and surprisingly good workout for the arms. I do weight training and I am in good shape, but this workout uses the muscles in a different way and I felt the burn! Some of the moves are challenging, and gave me a good laugh. But I must say that it was the most fun I ever had working out and the must fun workout prop I ever used."
1,Don't spend your money,"Besides the fact that Dolphina is clearly an inexperienced belly dancer (based on her other videos and the vague bio on her website) she isn't good at teaching. She will explain the move one way, demonstrate it, then when it's time to go full speed she does it a totally different way. If you're not interested in really learning veil work and just want to swish some fabric around in your living room, maybe this is for you. If you want clear instruction that will actually teach you something, look elsewhere. There are lots of other videos on Amazon that are made by actual belly dancers! Here are just a few:-Veil with Aziza Belly Dance Instruction DVD-Bellydance with Veil-Belly By Sandra Vol. 3: Classic Veil Intro (Bellydance Choreography Instructional)-Discover Bellydance: Mystic Dance"
2,Not packaged well,"I bought this cap ""NEW"" but when I opened the box it had no protection whatsoever. Cap was placed in the box and covered with carton paper. It got dirty and looked used."
5,Dicky boy is a liar,"I am Dj Danger, one of the 2 dj's that recorded this cd for dicky boy. We had an agreement as to a specific amount per cd sold. We made this cd 3 years ago, I got a sob story about how these cd's were not selling, crooked distribution agent, and so on. Now I just happen to find that it is for sell on Amazon.com . The previous review was factual, alot of good music on this cd, but why buy it and make a lying weasel some money. You can bet never again will I do ANY recording under the dicky boy label, otherwise known as dirty money."
3,It was ok.,"The product is exactly the same as the picture, really pretty, but after some days the foam becomes compressed. In my opinion, it should have more foam inside of it or one of better quality. Thanks"
3,not their finnest hour,"What is going on with the music industry in the last year? I will tell you what, ""It has gone down hill!"" This CD poves it. This CD is not terrible, it has a few good tracks, but compared to their other albums, it is sub-par. They took their band in a new direction, which is cool, i totally support expanding ones herizons. but i dont believe the new sound they were looking for was achieved, but every great band has had subpar attempts. So i will give them time and continue listening because i believe that the best music is still to come."
5,Great Album,"This is one of the best albums, I don't know why people don't think its good. I mean, it may be a little mellow but its still GREAT, and I'm sure the next album will be poppy too."
2,Not the Promise Ring i know and love,"I stumbled across this record at my local alternative record store. It surprised me to see it because it was not on Jade Tree records, but Epitaph. I hate to say it, but i think The Promise Ring has sold out. Davey sounds somewhat annoyed and desperate as he sings ""I've been the next big thing since i can remember me."" Gone are the simple, honest songs that sounded so refreshing on their previous albums. In their place are radio-friendly pop songs with everything from sring arrangements to a backing choir. Compared even to Very Emergency, it sounds over-produced and even hackneyed at times. What let me down the most about this album is its lack of the joy we heard on Very Emergency and the previous records. Having said all that, i could be wrong and just bitter that TPR has changed their sounds so dramatically, but this album makes me doubt Davey's intentions when he sings ""happiness is all the rage."""
2,rip PROMIsE RING,"It is always a sad day when a band that started a trend and could only be defined in themselves can suddenly draw comparisons from other bands. Wood Water is another album in the ever growing alt country genre. yes, this album sounds like a little wilco, a little ryan adams and so forth. Instead of creating a new music genre (nothing feels good), the promise ring have now limited themselves into a pre exixting one. And with woodwater, they dont even do anything interesting, just cliche' alt country. no, its not twangy country, but you certainly cant rock out to this record."
1,Really disappointing.,"I'm a big fan of their last few records, but not of this one. It's not poppy; it's not even emo. I guess the band are changing their sound but I loved their old sound. At least we have their old records. . ."
1,Sad but still good,"This is not one of my favorite albums by The Promise Ring, a matter of fact it is the only one i do not like, and I think that they really changed since Nothing Feels Good. There is only one song on the cd that i like and it is ""Get On The Floor."" I feel that they have goton to mellow but i am still going to love to see them open for Jimmy Eat World."
4,Stepping away from the emo stage,"In Wood/Water, the Promise Ring takes a step away from their distinctive emo-sound, resulting in the surfacing of a curious collection of unusual yet stunning music.Wood/Water is a unique mixture of rock/pop and indie music. Doesn't sound appealing? You better check it out before you make any assumptions.This CD is bursting with powerful songs which are full of dominating piano, acoustic guitar, and thoughtful lyrics. The mellow songs are generally calming and catchy, but occasional repetitive lyrics such as ""Hey, Hey, Hey,"" might cause you to fall into a sleepy trance.Overall, the way The Promise Ring has fashioned Wood/Water is a promising start of new-age psychedelic music."
2,lacking,"this album is the ""adult/mature"" version of the promise ring. it lacks previous PR energy which made them who they were and it's sad to see something like this happen to such a talented band. but we'll always have their older stuff which is where it's at..."
1,Too much like everything else,"How can a singer from Wisconsin suddenly develop a surfer-esque vocal style? These guys are trying too hard to sound like everyone else: Blink, Weezer, Green Day, etc.They are an okay live band, except when the singer makes fun of other bands (that have actually made it like Lynyrd Skynyrd). I wouldn't invest too much money in these guys. They may get their 15 minutes of fame, but as far as real staying power, they shouldn't quit their day jobs."
4,promises so much...and delivers,"Ok, first listen left me a little dissapointed - this record is NOT as immediate as previous TPR efforts, but equally as rewarding and enjoyable..given time..Much in the same way that the Get Up Kids new album is a step away from their 'punkier' roots, so Wood/Water demonstrates how the Promise Ring have grown whilst still retaining the honesty of their earlier efforts. Buy this album, put it on repeat and sit back and relax. the songs are great, just give them time..."
3,"Good information, but they're not story-tellers","This was a very interesting book about sleeze, corruption, culture clash, and outright fraud. From an informational point of view, it was excellent. If you are doing research on Bre-X and want facts, this is your book.However, this book was not written by story-tellers. There were two co-authors, and I don't think they read each other's material carefully, because there was a lot of unnecessary repitition. Also, the story read like a series of newspaper articles. (The authors are newspaper reporters.) There was no sense of the ""big-picture"" story until the very last chapter.So I recommend this book to someone who wants to learn about Bre-X. If you're just looking for an entertaining fraud story, I'm not sure this is the best choice."
3,Smaller than I thought,I didn't realize that this is a pocket dictionary. I thought that it would be more comprehensive.
2,If you want to test what you know this is the book for you.,It had the things you know mixed in with the things you wouldn't think of. The answers are things you would never think of. You really have to rack your brain to think of the right answer which I promise you is not totally impossible.
4,The Weigh to Win Rainbow Food Plan and Nutrition Guide,"The food plan is well balanced. I did lose weight on it when I followed the plan. I think it would be good to have a ""buddy"" to share the plan with and work together to encourage each other. Similar to other food plans that use portion control."
3,janis paige?,"where is the song ""stereophonic sound?"" wasn't that from this picture? and wasn't janis paige the second female lead in this picture? or was that ""funny face."" can somebody straigthen this out for me?"
5,Addicted! We can't seem to get enough.,"I can not express the delight this game has brought our family. We seriously play this game every night after dinner - 6 rounds! We had to put a limit on it somehow! Easy to play, we have played this game since child was 7 and still love it. Our game is in such poor condition from the over-use. Does anyone have one they don't want? Detailed info cards give fun facts about characters that are good for any Disney fan."
5,"The ""bible""...","Indeed, some call this little book the ""bible"" of non-euclidean geometry and for good reasons.Despite some cryptic parts, it's the only attempt -- and successful --to treat both hyperbolic geometry and, even more, elliptic geometry synthetically (no quaternions, tensors and al...) , something that even Coxeter could not achieve (see my review on his ""Non-Euclidean Geometry"")."
2,"Ultimately, No","This laptop stand ends up placing your monitor at a high angle. It is not comfortable to have to look up to your screen for an extended period of time, or over the course of many days. Also, the finish is more matte than gloss and doesn't clean well, and it can scuff or stick to surfaces. Purchasing this ultimately turned out to be a mistake."
4,Great way to start an outdoor kitchen,"The Weber side burner is a great way to start an outdoor kitchen. While it might not be enought for extreme BBQers it should be enough for the casual cooker.Depending on the installation, you might need to get a sleeve if your outdoor kitchen is made of combustible materials."
3,Useful to Study the Trojan War,"The most famous book about the Trojan War is definitely Homer's ""The Iliad"". It is very interesting, but not easy to read. And it doesn't describe the Trojan War from beginning to end. This book describes the whole aspects of the war concisely and plainly, from the dispute among three goddesses (Judgement of Paris) to the last part of the war that are not described in ""The Iliad"" (Achilleus's death, the Trojan Horse and the fall of Troy).This book is too concise to be exciting and/or touching. But it is a good reference to get a brief knowledge of the Trojan War, especially for a Non-Westerner who is not so familiar with the Greek Myths. And it is useful to prepare for and/or review ""The Iliad"". If this book interests you, I strongly recommend you to also read ""The Iliad"" that is much deeper and more fascinating."
1,i didn't like it,i didn't enjoy the book because it was boring and it as easy to get distracted. i won't recomend this book to anyone.
2,no illustrations in my edition,"I have not yet read this book- so my review is only based on my disappointment that I bought this book after reading about the wonderful illustrations. I have a much longer version of the Iliad, which I am reading to my children. I bought this so I could read it to them also, to give them more of an understanding of the Iliad. I read the wonderful reviews about the illustrations and thought the book sounded perfect. While the cover is beautiful, it is the ONLY illustration in the whole book. The older edition must be the one with the pictures, I will be checking into whether or not it is still available."
4,We rather liked it.,"I read this aloud to my 6 and 10 year olds, and we enjoyed it (as well as Sutcliffe's companion book on the Odyssey). I thought the illustrations were well suited to the text and added interest, and the story held my children's and my interest as well. I would recommend it."
5,Great way to introduce the classics and literature to boys,"I read ""Black Ships Before Troy"" and ""The Wanderings of Odysseus"" to my then 8-year-old son, who was enthralled by both. Rosemary Sutcliff's prose is rich and lyrical, and the illustrations in our copies (by Alan Lee) were beautiful."
4,Black Ships before Troy,"The ""Black Ships before Troy"" has amazing illustrations. It is very well written because the book explains the story very well. It starts out with the story of how the war got started, and slowly made it to the war. The only confusing part is all of the names. I am not used to the names and that makes it even harder to remember who is who. Overall this was a very good book, and I recommend reading it. I am in 6th grade and I think that it is a great book for someone my age."
2,Included only 1 movie,"I ordered this item primarily for the Secret Garden movie. When it came, it was still shrink-wrapped and looked complete, but only The Little Princess was included. Its a good movie and for the price, we just kept it. But now I need to go buy the Secret Garden again."
4,no widescreen,"The back of the cover said there was fullscreen and widescreen versions of the films and there was only fullscreen. That's my only complaint. I bought this for my sister to replace the VHS tapes she played throughout her childhood of both of these films and those were fullscreen, so she doesn't care. I always prefer to watch things in widescreen and now with widescreen televisions it just makes sense for films to be formatted in widescreen. It's an excellent value though."
5,Delightful movies; great price!,"These are such nice, enjoyable, and uplifting movies. Though their happy endings are predictable, that's not so bad, and they provide a beneficial break from the dismal political and economic world around us. Both were well produced and acted. And at such a low price--wow, what a deal!"
1,Pathetic!,This DVD was ordered because it said in the description that both full screen and widescreen versions were present. That is false representation. Only the widescreen version is present. The people look tall and thin and not only that the viewing is impossibly grainy. I think this DVD was placed on the disk by filming a TV viewing with a camera. Do not buy this double feature as it is a rip-off! Two great movies have been tarnished by misleading statements and terrible DVD production.
1,No widescreen version included,"Although a customer has already noted this in the ""Customer Discussion"" section, I want to call this to the attention of future buyers in the review section as well: despite the description on the box, there is no widescreen version. Luckily, I bought this in my town and can return it easily."
3,"Good Movies, but misleading","I love both of these movies, but I was quite disappointed because there is a very misleading print on the back that says there is both widescreen as well as fullscreen inside. I'm just glad that these aren't my all-time favorite movies, or I'd really be disappointed in the false advertising. So, heads up, they're both full screen and not wide. Otherwise, love the movies. The Secret Garden is one of my favorite stories."
1,Do not buy - total scam,"Love both of these movies and could not wait to get for my kids. However this is not a double feature, the Secret Garden does not exist on this DVD. I ordered one, complained to Amazon who acted like I was trying to scam them over a $5 item and they finally sent another one. Guess what, same thing, only Little Princess. Save yourself the headache and buy the 2 movies separately, there is no value/savings with this particular item."
1,Unhappy customer as incomplete order,It is not a good idea to buy this product as the title is misleading. Instead of there being two DVD disks in the box there is only one. It's a shame as our little girls has been waiting ages for these films and now she is disappointed.
3,"I liked one movie, but not the other.","I liked and really enjoyed The Secret Garden, but I did not enjoy The Little Princess as much. I just got kind-of so what with it."
2,It still worked...,... Although I pulled it out of its case all scratched up and looking like it had sat in water for days
5,Interesting,The movies were interesting and fun to watch. They keep you entertained and you can watch them many times and not become bored.
1,Technical Answer,"Let me make this clear right from the start. This is a 5 star DVD! The only reason I rated it 1 star was so that this would be read. One reviewer mentioned that the disc has no printing on it, and they only found one movie on it. Dont forget folks, that the disc is dual sided..just turn it over and the other film is on that side. I used to work at a DVD testing facility, so what I have figured out regarding the full screen/wide screen aspect problem is, it seems to be a player issue. Some players will read both aspects,and others won't. Don't give up if you cant view the 16x9 wide screen. Try it in another player or your laptop,because its definetly on there. Although if you cant play it in your living room, then perhaps return it, or consider a better quality dvd player. At any rate...whoever did the testing on this disc really dropped the ball because it should play in most players. But if the box says its wide screen...believe it...it is. Hope this helps."
5,Cute Book,"Cute book! My 16 month old daughter loves books, and enjoys flipping through the colorful pages of Elmo's 12 Days of Christmas"
2,Tried to read this book different times!,"Boring travelogue which I tried to read on 3 separate occasions, however I did enjoy Genghis Khan by Jack Weatherford. His account of the Silk Road is fascinating."
4,"Good, but only if you like travel writing","I have a soft spot in my heart for anyone who travels to Central Asia and writes about the region's people. If you intend to travel to this part of the world, this is a good book to buy if you like travel writing. Another great book is The Opportunists by Yohann de Silva. Its a fiction/thriller that presents modern day Uzbekistan through a really interesting page-turner. The story is fiction but the context is 100% accurate. Here's a link:The Opportunists: A Novel"
3,Something is not right....,Enjoyed the book. I am a big fan of Wilfred Thesiger's writing style so I found the author's language to be too elaborate. I've lived in Central Asia for a time and thought some of the descriptions to be a bit too generous. The effort put in to sound poetic was obvious.
3,So the Silk Road's not what it was.,"If Thubron had just written a history, or even a work of fiction, on the cultures his journey passes through, I would I suspect have enjoyed it much more. His tale of backpacking today along these endless grimy roads sadly contains little of equal interest. His encounters and conversations add more or less nothing that is not familiar from generic westerner-wandering-around-the-middle-east works and the logistics of travel are less interesting still.If the point of the book is to contrast a history, albeit romanticised, with a mundane present, I can't help but think that wasn't a particularly successful structure here.Fans of Mr Thubron might enjoy this part of his personal journey, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking to read about the silk road, or its component parts today."
4,A Shadow of its Former Glories,"Read with full engagement. Such is Thubron's elegant prose; the acute perceptions of his fellow travellers and of those inhabiting the areas through which he traverses. Dabblings of historic reference, sufficient to ground the reader, detain them in the area for about as long as Thubron is in the place himself. This isn't the first book I've read about the road. But it is the sweetest bit of writing. However, as a primer for emulating his journey, it's probably a deterrent. Even by his own admission, things in the various economies and social structures have deteriorated since his previous visit. The attractions of Isfahan, Samarkand, Bokara and the rest, in short, the reasons I might wish to go into these regions, seem far less aluring under the weight of contemporary developments. I might settle for a re-read, instead!"
2,Slogging along in the Shadows of the Silk Road,"Barren landscapes, indigenous people desperate to leave; temples and monuments crumbling in ruin and the author covers it all in three hundred and forty four pages of barren text leaving the reader desperate to leave the book. Traveling the Silk Road could have been a fascinating adventure but this book offers no insight, portrays no curiousity as to why things are they way they are and if you can make it to the end of the journey you have endured!There are numerous better sources of first hand accounts of adventure travel in these regions. It is simply too hard to find kind words, a compliment, or a recommendation for this book."
5,Vivid descriptions,"Colin Thubron vividly describes his experiences when he travelled the ""Silk Road"" - which we learn isn't really just one road, by the way. He tells about parts of the silk road that most of us will never have the stamina to visit. He made me feel as if I were there with him seeing it all and I never had to leave my comfortable chair to travel on a third class bus over bumpy roads thru frigid mountain regions. He masterfully weaves history and anthropology into the descriptions of what he sees and experiences."
4,AJ,"I bought these for a bikini competition. When they arrived, I couldn't get my swollen feet in them and started to panic! It then ocurred to me that they're plastic, so I was able to stretch the tops out a bit in order to get my feet in. Turns out, they fit better than any of my other competition shoes! They stayed on the whole day and looked pretty sassy up on stage."
2,TOO EXPENSIVE!!,Since when did the Harry Potter Lego series become so d*mn expensive?! $400 for 300 pcs?! That's evenm more than the Star Wars sets!
5,Excellent Portrayal of the Game,"Now, I'm not a big fan of reading books, but I have beaten this game many many times and figured I'd check it out. I was so surprised to see myself not want to put the book down.This book portrayed the game perfectly, it went from character to character, describing all of their events and what related to the game.It even added a little bit of background events and dialogue that wasn't in the game, such as Wesker's manipulation of Barry to get him on his side. Also Barry's thoughts about the whole situation and having to lead Jill to Wesker. There was also a meeting of the S.T.A.R.S. teams prior to leaving to investigate.If you're looking for a very detailed novel that includes blood, gore, and of course swearing, or maybe you're just a huge fan of the game like me, then I strongly suggest this book.It's not a waste of money."
5,It was the best book I ever read!--Jimmy Burne Massapequa NY,"The book was great. I was surprised that at the end!I played the game for Playstation and the computer and the book was even better, it had every turn, zombie, door, locks, ect... I have never read that much in my life, but I read this book in a few days and its 262 pages and I'm only 11. I loved it!!"
2,Should be under Young Teens,What a shame to give such a good idea to such an untalented writer. This could have been written by anyone who played the game and has never written a thing. It was a quick and pathetic read that should be placed in the young teen section of bookstores. Please don't waste your money on this book or they might hire the author for future installments. This is a good idea that should be done by good writers.
2,This book was a disappointment,"The game having poor acting does not account for this book's complete lack of writing skill. I was so inspired by this books stupidity that I wrote a report on it for English, pointing out its flaws. I could have exceeded the four pages that I used"
5,A Great Book,This book was A great book man I got the thing on a Friday and Finished it on Saterday. That Friday I stayed up till 2:30 reading it I just kept saying I'll read one more Chapter. All&All A great book the greatest book ever.
5,Itchy. Tasty. Again,"This book was totally a butt-kikin' zombie likin' taaaasty book. (that means good) I havn't read the other ones, but I doubt their this good. However, I think the ones that gave it like one star didnt play the game. But I, myself havnt played the first one much, but beat the second one, and I love it. The besst line in the book would be Chris sayin' ""Bite me."" (You'll see.) And to all the little ones out there that wanna read it, GO FOR IT! I'm not actally old enough to read it, infact, I'm extremely surprised the store clerk sold it to me. Dont have your parents read the fine print on the bottom on the back. Just tell 'em Its called ""Resident Non-evil. It worked for me. Well, I like the book, thats pretty much it. GO BUY IT! (all those who possess $[money] of course)"
5,IT FELT LIKE I WAS THERE!!,"If you love the video game or just want to know alittle more about it, buy this book. You will not be able to put it down, I read it in two days. The fights are intense and the character development is great. I didn't know anything about team Bravo tell I read this book. S.D. Perry did incredible job portraying the book to the game. If you love good fight, mysterys, and the compeling battle between good, Evil and zombes!"
5,Kick Ass!,This book was so cool. I began to read it and I got so into it that it only took my 2 hours to read. I found it eazy to get into. It tells you about the people before they became S.T.A.R.S. and why they ack the way they do. I sugjest you bye this book if you are a hard core Resident Evil fan then you should get it. I did. :)tguffy
4,Awesome!!!,"I have never played the games, but after talking to fans of the games and the books, I thought I would check out this book and I just couldn't put it down. I felt like the characters as they where in the Spencer Estate, trying to figure out how to get out of the nightmare!!!!I liked it so much that I want to get the first game and live the journey itself!!!"
5,This book was better than the game,"Umbrella conspiracy is one of the best (and shortest) books I've read in a long time. The whole story is expanded from the game so if fans read it there will be numerous questions answered,and as far as newcomers you're gonna love this book! Thats all there is to it. This book just blows every other sci-fi book away! This is also a good book for people who don't want to sit down and read for months to get a good story."
5,"SCARY, FUN AND A GREAT READ!","I HAVE READ AND RE-READ THIS BOOK THREE TIMES. THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS ARE DONE IN A COMPLETELY BELIEVABLE MANNER AND THE STORY PROGRESSES SMOOTHLY. IT'S ALSO SCARY AS HELL AND IN SOME PARTS, DISGUSTING ( LIKE WHEN THE ZOMBIES ARE DESCRIBED IN FULL DETAIL ) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AND THE SECOND IN THE SERIES, CALIBAN COVE, WAS JUST AS GOOD."
5,don't be scared it won't kill you,"ok we've played the game and we can read book, I mean come on do you realy want sit there and play the game for 3 hours or just read the book in less then one. I mean it's not as good as a dragonlance novel but it'll do."
3,it was OK...,"Well, all I can say is it was like reading about someone else playing a computer game. There was some cool action parts, especially at the beginning, but after that it went downhill. The end was very dissapointing, because of its total lack of originality. If you have a lot of spare time, then go ahead and read this book, but otherwise, there must be better ones out there, no matter what your interest."
5,A Great Tanslation!!!,"This is a great book that is pretty faithful to the original game. All of the characters resemble their game counterparts. It starts off slow, then really starts to pick up. This is a great collectable for Resident Evil fans. There where only two problems. One, they combined Jill and Chris's story together. That means ... I won't spoil it. Two, the Yawn battle was way too short, I mean they fit it on two pages, my god. A Great Buy!!! Nuff said!"
3,My daughter loved it...,"I did not read it, but my daughter did, so I am pleased. Hey, it is a book, not an APP or download. It is always great to feel the paper and the turning pages..."
5,Great buy,"Brand new book, never been read for a very low price. The shipping was more than this great book. The binding was still intact, so I was the first one to break it in."
4,A DECENT ADAPTATION OF THE GAME,"I WAS HOPING FOR VARIATION FROM THE GAME, BUT ONE NOT STRAYING TOO FAR FROM IT. AND I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW WELL MY EXPECTATIONS WERE REALIZED. PERRY DID A FAIRLY GOOD JOB OF MAKING THE GAME MAKE SENSE IN A REAL WORLD SETTING."
4,This is a Great Book!,"Although it didn't meet my expectations, I must say that this is one very suspense-filled book. It's true, once you start reading it, you can't put it down because you want to know what happens next. S.D. Perry talks about many of the monsters in great detail, and this is a must-read for all Resident Evil fans. If you love Resident Evil, then you'll love this book. I definitely recommend it."
5,Excellent Book!!!!!,While many may not like the gore of this book and the suspense it brings will be very familiar to video gamers who have played the game. While it is sort it is very enjoyable and you will not want to stop reading it.
2,Dissapointment,"I couldnt understand why this book was getting such good reviews. But then I realized that everyone says they played the game for like 15 mins or so. Ive played All The RE games and beat every one of them And in My opinion their was ALOT more Hapening in the games than what Perry had wrote. I was quite bored with it but i decided that ill read the whole collection before I critisize it I love the Game series And hoped that the books would get better.Half way thru Book 4 I gave up.There Was A big Scene in the game i was waitin to read but it never happened.I think Alot of the key elements of the story were cut out and replaced with the B.S. Like Jill Solving The Puzzle Of The Colored Paintings.If you want better Story That will actually scare you, Play the games. If you Suck at games Buy the Stratey Guide too."
5,Resident Evil #1 The Umbrella Conspiracy by S.D. Perry,"Excellent book. I always had trouble focusing while reading. I would read a page and then go back and read it again because I forgot what I read. Not after I read this book. I love horror stories and the book reads great. I have read all the books in the series, plus some Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance books after this. I also read Idoru, Gates of Fire, and the Human Comedy, and classics like Slaughterhouse Five, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and the Good Earth."
5,Sweet!,"The novel Resident Evil, the umbrella conspiracy was a really good book. It was scary in some parts. I never lost intrest in it at all. I am looking forward to reading the next novel. The writing in this one flowed and stayed on track. It is the scariest book i have ever read in my entire life so far."
4,This taste of Resident Evil will leave you itching for more!,"S.D. Perry's first Resident Evil novel is a straight forward adaptation of the first game, perhaps a bit too straight forward. The characters run through all the game's famous spooky and gruesome obstacles, but it lacks a certain dramatic punch. Too often Perry opts to simply describe a brief run in with each of the game's threats and/or puzzles and then just rush on to the next one without any attempt at exploiting it for optimum suspense with a more drawn out battle and/or mental legwork. Despite that sometimes irritating weakness, the book, like the game, is just too much fun of a ride to not recommend. In the book's favor, Perry sketches in details and background that fleshes out the setting and characters quite nicely, leaving this reader hungry for more. Good thing it's become a series, the book is as addictive as the game, I couldn't put it down. Required reading for all Resident Evil fans."
3,Good Book,"The book about the original game that started it all. This was in no way a bad book. It was a pretty good book, but it didn't seem all that exciting. Probably because I had already beaten the video game and knew the story and ending well. Regardless of that, this book is still a must buy for any reader who wants a suspenseful book or is a Resident Evil fan."
5,Great book,"I love the book and the game,the book gives more detail and lets you know what the other team members are/were doing when you played as Chis or Jill in the game, S.D. Perry is a good author and really brought out the flavor of the Game and brought it out in the book. If you like the games than read the books you will not be sorry."
5,As Good As The Game,"If you read this book before playing the game, all I can say is that it's as good as a cheat book. You find out how to find all the puzzle pieces, find out where the traps are and about the different kinds of monsters. Perry made a great attempt at creating an exciting, adventerous book and for those who love the resident evil games, they will love it even more. Perry gives the characters some depth and also works outside the game, giving it a unique quality. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys si-fi or just a good read. An excellent book, 5 stars."
4,The beginning,"Well S.D Perry you've done good! First of all I waould say its a great book. It's not as scary as reading Clive Barker or as tricky as reading Dean R Koontz. but I must say it's a great book. It wakes up old fright about being alone in a mansion.As for the People in the story they are very clever writer, and the story is easy to read. It is not a book full of surprise, but still it keeps the reader wanna to read more.If you have played the Game, you should really read it, because you have the rooms and the atmosphere in your mind. But if you never have played the game, please read the book, it's maybe I'm exaggeration a little but the story is cunning and scary.Well Have fun all.!!"
5,Resident evil the umbrella conspiracy,Awesome book I would recommend any resident evil book written by s.d. Perry to friends and family. Overall 5/5 solid book
5,Always a good read,I read this when it first came out and still enjoy reading now. It follows the game rather well but has different twists which is good.
3,stuck pretty close to the origal story.,"on the upside it was cool how they blended jill and chris's separate adventures into one story that made sense. on the downside, Wesker was not killed by the chimaera, he was slain by Tyrant. and they didnt have the battle between chris/jill and Tyrant in the lab."
5,A good novel out of a great video game.,"first off I want to comment on how well the auther novelized the game into the book, and how well he made you feel like your actually chris or Jill walking around inside the mansion. Second I want to say that the detail of the monsters and blood were intense. There were so intense that I had to put the book down for a few seconds to stop and catchmy breath cause my heart was pounding so hard and fast! The third thing I want to say about it is that there were a few dissapointments, like there was no colt magnum and no plant 42 battle, Oh! One other dissapointment, there wasn't a bazooka.Overall the intense details and the plot were so powerful that it made up for having no colt, plant42 battle or no bazooka. This is one of my favorite books and if your into science fiction and horror this is a book for you."
3,1st Movie Was Good. The 2nd Sucks,"The original Dennis the Menace was a pretty good movie. It was funny and I thought the acting was good. The second movie had a whole different set of actors that just did a horrible job. Not only that, but the plot to the second movie just stunk. There wasn't anything really funny or exciting about the second movie either.I would probably recommend this dvd for the first movie, but definitely not for the second. If you can buy the dvd with just the 1st movie for cheaper, I would recommend you do that."
2,Oh Mr. Wilsonnn......,"Dennis the Menace (1993) Hank Ketcham's comic strip character is brought to life as the latest attempt by John Hughes to cash in on his own Home Alone series. It's really too bad, because the film is so perfectly cast: Mason Gamble (Spy Hard) is an acceptable Dennis; Lea Thompson (Back to the Future) and Robert Stanton (Bob Roberts) couldn't be more likable as Dennis' parents; and Walter Matthau and Joan Plowright are absolutely perfect as Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. But the film, which starts off well, eventually slides directly into Home Alone territory, especially with the introduction of a thief character (Christopher Lloyd-Back to the Future) whom Dennis trips up in that painful ""Kevin vs Harry and Marv"" way. This one gets sooo painful, in fact, it's nearly unwatchable. Still, the kids are sure to love, so there will probably be a viewing in your future if you're a parent."
1,RIPPED OFF,"i ordered this ""new"" for my grandson for christmas the problem is there was only one movie on it he did not get strikes again and was very dissapointed i have contacted amazon and they have never answered me so i guess thats called being ripped off!"
3,I love the title song-the story and acting are so-so.,"The acting and actors do a credible job. Nothing great, but adequate. The title song makes up for it. The song is terrific, and I love the segments of the movie that include the song."
5,If I ever see you again,As a 10 year old I remember watching this on cable with my family and falling in love with the music. Now 20 yrs later I can still sing every song...they are all beautiful! Great sentimental movie and I can't wait to give it to my dad for his 70th...we've been talking about the movie for years...wish it had made it to video stores!
4,"A touching, sentimental romance.","It's many years since I saw this movie, yet I would purchase it in a moment if I could find it available on video. Anyone who has had an experience like the protagonists can relate to this story. Isn't it such a basic human reaction, expecially when young, to deal with rejection by resolving to do something great to win the love of the person who rejected you? Haven't we all dreamed of doing that? It's my supposition that Joe Brooks was telling a thinly fictionalized version of his own life - and it worked. Jaded, cynical critics may not have liked it, but anyone with a heart - and a romantic streak - will enjoy it."
2,Not the best movie I ever saw but a good love story,"This movie lacks acting, but has the plot of a good love story. I saw it once 20 years ago because my college marching band(the CCSC blue devils)including me, traveled to New York City to be in a small scene in the movie. I would love to get a copy for nastalgia sake. The music was great in it and one of the songs "" If ever I see you again"" went on to be a big hit for Debbie Boone. Hope the studio releases it sometime soon!"
5,If Ever I See You Again,"This is a romantic feel good movie about two people who are destined for each other and how fate brings them together. It was originally made back in the 70's. It is an excellent movie with an excellent soundtrack. The main couple seems fairly ordinary, but I think that is what gives the movie its charm. I am really surprised that it hasn't been remastered in dvd. When the movie first came out in the 70's, I watched it several times. I have the VHS format now and have watched it several more times. I never seem to grow tired of it. If you like romance, you will love it."
1,If Ever I See You Again - NOT LIKELY!,"Being a huge Shelley Hack fan, I was thrilled to finally locate a copy of this movie. What a MAJOR disappointment! Shelley's character had the warmth of frozen popsicle. But even much worse is the lead actor - who sounded and looked like he was reading off cue-cards constantly. Too bad the movie doesn't match the quality of the music score. Oh well . . . .."
2,"If ever he sees you again, RUN!","Dull, predictable and lifeless story about a widower who gets a second chance at love with an old flame after a chance meeting. Good thing his wife died, huh?Triple threat Joseph Brooks probably figured ""You Light Up My Life"" packed them in so why not build another film around another syrupy song? Sadly, the song is even worse than ""You Light Up My Life"" and Joseph Brooks doesn't exactly make for the best leading man. There's absolutely no chemistry with Shelley Hack and she looks bored throughout the film (in all fairness, she ALWAYS looks bored).You've been warned."
3,If only it were produced in 1999,"This is the type of movie that the studios should be filming NOW. Sure it leaves something to be desired in the acting ability of both Brooks and Hack but that is the charm,,, they come off normal, just like us. I could relate and I loved the movie and the soundtrack. I have the soundtrack on 33 lp and taped the movie from TV on betamax long ago. It still plays on my old beta but its very rough. I WOULD LOVE FOR THE STUDIO TO RELEASE THIS AGAIN,,,, Who do I write with a request? This movie should be seen by both young and old lovers. It will take you back to a time when you let that ONE IN A MILLION get away and wondered what would happen if you searched them out again. I think its delightful and heart warming. Just what we need today in the theater. I will be checking back OFTEN to see the status."
3,"Good for a beginner, but...","This is a reasonably good video for someone who has little or no Tai Chi experience. The instructor does an excellent job of describing the weight shifts, and subtle movements. The video is disappointing for the intermediate student. It is advertised as a demonstration/training video for the Yang LONG form, yet only addresses the first three sections - half of it. I was hoping for a detailed view of sections 4 through 6, which are not addressed."
2,Poor rendering of a good video,"Many years ago I bought the VHS version of Terry Dunn's Tai Chi for Health. As noted by other reviewers, the DVD is the same as the VHS; not an update, or even a remaster. Still, I figured that the DVD would be more convenient to learn from. I was wrong. The DVD has the basic lessons divided into small sections of roughly 30-45 seconds that repeat until you hit ""Next"". This means you have to do the form with a remote in your hand. Also, there is no way to start at the beginning, and go thru, eg. 5 sections, and then repeat that. At least with the VHS, I can do this. Although the video quality is good, I cannot recommend this DVD, especially if you already have the VHS. Too bad, as Terry Dunn is a good video teacher; I would recommend the VHS, if you can stand the quality."
3,you need an empty mirror (sic),"so many point out the mirror-image issue (left=right et al) but all you need to do is to position a mirror in front of the TV, and place yourself between TV and mirror, facing the mirror. Problem solved.Instruction is good but I miss details on the martial arts application. The full demonstration at the end is not very satisfying asyou often can't see the legs."
5,more than others,This is better than other Tai Chi DVDs because it has extensive warm-up exercises plus teaches the long form exercise
2,I don't see how anyone could learn tai chi from this video,"Although Terry Dunn is very pleasant to watch, it was impossible for me to follow his video instructions. Except for the warm up exercises, which he explained in a very step-by-step manner. After the warm-ups, he lost me . . . demonstrating movement after movement nonstop . . . whoa! Also I kept getting my left and right mixed up. sigh."
4,The best out there!!,"This is by far the best long form dvd out there, between class and other DVD's, this is the most informative and easy to follow. I gave it a 4 only because of the really tricky way in which they show you the new move. It will only go on if you hit your remote control next or forward buttons. Which is kinda incoven. if you want to just keep going. On the plus side you can see the move you are learning over and over again until you learn it. Get this and you won't be dissapointed!"
2,Like to be Frustrated?,"I am studying Shaolin Kung Fu and thought that it would be nice to complement my studies with T'ai Chi.The difficulty of following this tape is really dissapointing. Everything that you are looking at is opposite of what you need to execute. In other words, if Dunn turns left and tells you to turn left, since you are looking at a ""mirror"" image, it is very straining to execute the movement. If the tape had shown some of the instruction from another angle I would have given this tape a big thumbs up. Nevertheless, if you are not concerned about following the instruction due to the reasons I mentioned above then you might be able to get quite a bit out of this.The reason I gave it two stars is because the quality of the production was exemplary.Personally, I am looking for another source. Good luck, and MORE CHI!"
1,Much more bad than good,"I ordered this DVD on the basis of some of the reviews - it was a big mistake. While Terry Dunn is very relaxing to listen to and obviously knows his stuff, the quality of the DVD makes its all but useless as a training tool. The DVD does not permit selection of the section I want to perform. The section that introduces you to the basic forms is so washed out that you cannot tell what the foot and hand positions are supposed to be.Finally, in the last segment where Terry performs the complete form, the camera pans in too often so that you cannot actually see the form from start to finish.Sadly, I highly recommend you seek another source of knowledge for this wonderful art. I know I will be looking for something better."
5,Excellant demonstration in slow motion and regular speed,This vidio seems professionally done. I was very happy with the full demo in regular speed and then the instructor also took you through each motion slowly and with verbal detailed instruction. Highly recommend for the person who has no or little access to classroom instruction!
5,Very well produced,"This Yang Style Long form Tai Chi is well produced and structured in a way for easy learning. There are different sections that you can refer to and a bonus section with only three different techniques that are not complicated and can be done right away which left me with a feeling of relaxation. This is not something that you can rush through because it is a method that has to be memorized and practiced. I have another DVD by another Tai Chi practioner that is the ""short form"" but I wanted this one as well once I get to a higher level. The first 56 moves in this DVD is the short form with some variation to the other DVD that I have. So you don't have to try to learn all 102 movements to feel accomplished. The bonus section is worth the price. It will make you feel like David Carradine for those of you who remember the TV show - Kung Fu."
4,DVD is not a new production,"If you already own the VHS, you may be wondering whether this is a new production, especially since the cover photo appears to be a 40-year-old Dunn. Wouldn't you like to see the results of some 20 years of practice? Imagine, too, all the ideas Dunn must have had over the years of what he could have done better on the video. Well, sorry, it's the same production as on the VHS tape, the same 20-year-old Dunn, the same soundtrack, including the same minor errors in verbal instruction.There is, nevertheless, some advantage in the DVD format over the VHS, if you haven't learned the form yet. There is a menu, with the form broken down into about 50 short pieces, and it will cycle through a chosen short piece repeatedly until you select ""next"" -- or you can play straight through the entire form. If you're like me, you'll use that automatic repetition of short pieces quite a lot, on your way to learning the form."
5,Excellent Video,This is the best Tai Chi video on the market. I've been studying martial arts for 16 years and this is the 1st Tai Chi video that i have seen that teaches the correct form move for move. Excellent video for learning this form.
5,Excellent,"I purchased this, with much trepidation, based on one person's 5 star review BUT indeed this is a wonderful video. The music is very appropriate and peaceful, the instruction is clear enough for beginners but the instructor's expertise is clear and will provide learning for many, many hours to come, and the instructor is wonderful, no silly jokes that will get annoying, very to the point yet not dry, seems very genuine. I am very pleased."
4,Hard to follow unless you know what you are doing,The form is done against a plain background so it's almost impossible to tell what direction he's moving. This tape is most usefull when paired with a book that tells you what direction to face.
4,Excellent instruction and easy to follow.,I was impressed with Terry and the way he taught. There is warm up and then full instruction on the long form (Yang style.) I am practicing Wu style now but wanted to see variations in styles. I recommend this tape for any style of Tai Chi.
4,Nice alarm clock,"I have had one for over a year now (maybe, even two years - it's been a long time, I simply don't remember when I bought it). I like it, works fine. Looks great.The only slightly negative things I can say about it that the low sound setting is still too loud and scares me every morning, and that the ""alarm on"" indicator doesn't always come on when I turn the alarm on. The alarm still goes off in the morning, but sometimes I have to check whether I actually turned it on instead of just glancing at the ""screen"".I recently bought another one for my husband as well."
3,Inconvenient and unsrue of results.,i ahve taken this mineral for years in a chelated tablet form.this form is liquid; and really not sure its as effective.Also poor instructions as to how to take it - do I hold it in mouth for absorption or does that matter?Also cannot take it with me. No label on the glass bottle. had to make one with my labeler.
2,I was a fool--learn from my mistake,"I bought this audio book even after I read the many negative reviews. I saw a couple of positive reviews and thought it might not be that bad. Never have I been more mistaken. The didactic tone of the character Richard's ""speeches"" put me off. I became so frustrated that I literally fast-forwarded through an hour of Richard's diatribes. I thank Terry Goodkind for his amazing first few books and will cherish their memory, but somewhere along the way he lost the gift of story-telling. Buyer beware, you will regret this purchase."
1,Not for the serious student,"I found this video to be a waste of money if you want to learn zils. Now if you want to pretend you are a Goddess and repeat silly statements (like ""I am a belly dancer"" and ""I am ready for my massage"") to learn some patterns, this is the video for you. Personally, I found this video pretty funny. The problem, of course, is that this video is not supposed to be a comedy! I am sure her heart is in the right place but I wonder why more instructors can't put out instructional videos with substance (and while I am at it, REAL middle eastern music)."
1,Not worth the money,"If you have a teacher who has taught you beladi (""i am ready for my massage ....ugh""!!!!) then this video is not for you. I hesitate to say it is for beginners given how short it is."
1,'Isn't she pretty'?,"Unfortunately, I think that all of her bellydance tapes have been at such angles, that I couldn't learn how to do a certain part of ANY dance. I'm sure her husband, or someone who really likes her is the one taking the video, and doing the angle shots, because it may be 'pretty' for a guy to look at, but for us ladies who seriously are interested in learning, it's frustrating. Yes, she is pretty, but I won't be buying any more of her dvd's. Only gave her one star, so my message would go through, otherwise, even a star would give points down on these dvd's!"
2,This is NOT a Workout,"These moves are so easy that my 95-year-old arthritic grandmother could perform them without difficulty. I never broke a sweat or even warmed up. The cool-down is a total joke. There is nothing to cool down from. I gave it two stars because I did at least get to use my finger cymbals, which I enjoy."
3,Not bad if you just want an idea of how to do,"I am not a real fan of Dolphina although I have three of her videos. I purchased this because she does place things on an elementary level that doesn't cause you to back away. If anything the small phrases do help while learning the zills which I think is one of the hardest things to do when you are dancing. Yes, it seems funny strange but it's not a total turn off and gets you up to find more information on zills with at least the basic knowledge of zills. Not a Rabbit video but I do wish that it was about that cost."
2,"Great concept, but too short...","This is the first and last Dolphina DVD I plan on getting. My biggest gripe with it is that it is way too short. There is a total of about 25-30 minutes of actual instruction. Thats it. A DVD can hold so much more information than that. It seems overpriced to me. Other negative aspects of it are the annoying super happy/perky high school cheerleader attitude of the instructor. It seemed forced. Also, most bellydance videos/DVDs include a professional performance at the end where you can see things come together. This does not include that.The one positive aspect of this DVD is the way that she chooses to teach the rythms. She introduces catchy phrases as ways to memorize the zill rythms as opposed ot the ""dum-tek-a-dum"" nonsense seeming syllables that most instructors use. Dolphina's method is easier to remember at first and therefore easier to learn if you don't have a regular instructor that you take classes under."
1,"Forget about the $, not worth your time!","I actually was slightly embarrassed when watching this, thinking that someone might believe that this attempt to teach zils is an accurate representation of the artform. Maybe Dolphina's style is not my cup of tea but she seems all fluff and no substance."
1,If you are serious about learning zils - this is not for you!,This video was a joke and I will never buy another Dolphina product again! This video is made for someone who is just playing around with bellydancing; it is not for someone who wants to learn the different rhythms that are needed to learn in order to play the zils correctly.
1,Not worth it,"The candles don't smell very good and if they did it's not even a strong smell. Don't waste your time on these. Nice idea, but not what I expected."
4,Fun And Funny,"A very fun, easy read. Mr. Rossi's storytelling credentials equal that of his very impressive musical credentials. It's nice that Mr. Rossi had all these great experiences. It's a treat that he shared them with us. A delightful read for the musician and non-musician alike. We hope that he is considering a sequal."
4,Great gift item....,"There are a lot of enjoyable anecdotes here, with quite a substantial number of close encounters with celebrities. I got a copy for my parents (who are always difficult to shop for), as many of the encounters involve celebrities they are familiar with. Another nice feature of this book is that you can read it in one sitting or one or two anecdotes at a time. Rossi's writing style is conversational, and makes for pleasant reading.It's a fun book."
5,Sun Dial Press edition,I just bought this exact book on eBay for $20. The Sun Dial Press edition is not the 1st edition Scribner and Sons. Good luck trying to sell it for over $700 folks. Great book btw.
5,Good read about two extraordinary women,Became interested in the Cone sisters when attending an exhibit of their collection. I wanted to know more about these two extraordinary women. This book filled in a lot of the back story. It is well written and a joy to read. I missed reading about them every day when it was finished.
2,For frisbee collectors only,"Don't be fooled by the title, this is not the complete book of frisbee. Ultimate only rates a couple of pages, for starters. There is nothing to speak of on throwing technique. It is not particularly well edited, either - many assertions and heresay have slipped through the net. Lots of nice pictures of collectable discs, if that's what you're into. A bit of a disappointment given the dearth of books-in-print about throwing technique and ultimate."
4,Biased Opinion,"I would have bought this book even if I weren't a D&D; geek, because I am a rabid fan of the Black Company books. I read it cover to cover with the compulsive, sweaty-palmed fervor of a devotee, but I can see some problems for most normal people:The rules make some radical departures from standard 3.5 games, totally eliminating some staples of D&D; (clerics, for instance). This has an effect of many other aspects of the game (no clerics? no quick healing...no quick healing, much higher body count). I would not recommend this for the average Greyhawk or Forgotten Realms player. Personally, that's what attracted me to the books in the first place: no elves, no unpronounceable names, and a sword in the guts will kill even the most beloved characters.The editing is ugly in places but that's a quibble.Recommeded for Black Company fans and / or very open-minded d20 players in search of some gritty and grim action."
4,Gritty and Daring,Dark fantasy and gritty realism merge to form a world where you can almost smell the battle fields and seige engines. The classes are unique and the magic system is flexible but deep beyond first blush. I spent hours just figuring out the basic spells and was amazed at the effects possible and prices the mage would pay to create them. Fans of the Conan novels or Grey Mouser will find this a good fit where magic is terrible and great but not slick and quick like classic D&D. Glen Cook's novels are well studied and the detail is amazing.
4,We walk in the door to the smell of brown rice,"We're pretty happy with the rice cooker - we wanted to eat more brown rice, but the time it takes to cook means we never can do it on a work night (which for us is 6 days a week). Being able to throw it together on the way out the door and have it be ready when we come back in is fully worth the $$. Haven't tried anything but brown rice so far, but we're thrilled. My rating would go up if the instruction manual was a little better written - it was a bit vague and made it seem harder than it is. However, once you figure out how to do it, it's really simple, especially because it saves your 2 favorite times for rice to be finished."
5,What a cute rice cooker! It's easy to use!,"I bought this rice cooker, and once I see it in person, I was surprised with the cute size. It's so adorable. It is good for 2-3 people and works very well, there are options for brown rice, white rice and sushi rice etc. So it is easy to deal with cooking rice. I usually cook brown rice, usually 1 cup is enough for 2 people. sometimes I do 2 cups, but it is easy to cook so i DON'T care I cook rice often so we can have fresh rice."
5,Your Mother in an Appliance,Wake up to perfectly cooked cinnamon steel-cut oats and come home to perfectly cooked brown basmati rice. It's like having your own mother's meals ready for you when you get up or get home. I had a less expensive National rice cooker but it did not have the timer function and it was much harder to clean. I use this machine at least once a day and it is making sticking to a healthful diet much easier. I am very happy to recommend this product.
3,Rice Cooker Zojirushi,The supporting information does not indicate that quinoa does not cook well with this cooker. High heat and frequent inspections give about the sane results as a boiling pan on the stove. Does a nice job on different kinds of rice.
2,Customer Service is awful,"The rice cooker works fine until a month later I found there were steaming waters and foggy at the clock display area. I called their customer service dept and they told it needed to be repaired because computer chips could be damaged. So I asked them if it was under warranty since I only had for a month, they said no. They said it is not a manufacturing default. I asked them I cooked the rice according to the instruction, if it is not a manufacturing default, then what could that be? She said she had no answer, however she insisted on that was not the manufacturer's fault. I really don't understand her and don't understand her logic. I asked to talk to the manager, but only got the voice mail. I asked them to call me back but they never did. It is a very expensive product in terms of rice cooker. But they treat their customer like..... you are a sucker!"
5,Works awesome,I just got this rice maker and have to agree with all the other reviews.....This rice maker is awesome. I made jasmine rice yesterday and brown rice today. Perfect both times.Strongly recommend this machine to anyone looking for a great rice maker. The warmer keeps the rice warm for a very long time. No need to put in fridge and then reheat. I hope to make oatmeal and try some rice recipes very soon !
5,The best rice cooker i've ever owned!!,"I bought this rice cooker after trying others and nothing comes close to how this rice cooker makes rice. It's excellent. The rice comes out perfect everytime. Soft, fluffy, tender and just right.I bought the 3-cup rice cooker and if you serve the perfect portion it serves about 6 people (a spoon & 1/2).It's compact and easy to keep clean and store in any small space.I think this is the best rice cooker i've ever owned. I love it!!"
5,Great little rice cooker,The overall quality of this rice is pretty good.The functions are easy to use and the rice it cooks comes out nicely.
3,Good cooker bad seal,"I cook rice everyday. The cooker itself looks nice and it's great while the moisture seal is new and supple, but after a year or so this rubber seal tends to flatten. And then you won't be able to keep the rice warm too long before you have rice that is dry on top and soggy at the bottom. This is the 2nd zojirushi Microm i have owned with the same problem and yes the teflon on the bowl wears off too. Wish it was stainless instead."
4,Tiny!,"I knew it was a smaller rice cooker, but I didn't expect it to be that tiny! Its great though.. I love how it sings to you when you make rice, and sings when rice is done. You can change this, but I like it. Its perfect for my boyfriend and I.. but if you have more than 3 people to feed you'll need to make multiple pots of rice. I'd suggest the bigger size if you eat a lot or entertain a lot. I really like that it has a portable handle, and that it has a rubber rim that seals the rice in. The reason I give it 4 stars is because it isn't clear on how to make the different kinds of rice.If you use the 'fingertip' of water above the rice, like you do in most med. rice cookers.. it still works in this small one. I recommend!"
5,I love this machine!,I absolutely love rice. But I am the only one in my household who eats it and I never took the time to cook on stovetop just for myself. The only time I would ever eat rice would be at a restaurant (which is hardly ever). After reading all the favorable reviews I decided to splurge on myself and boy am I ever happy I did. Perfect - Perfect - Perfect every time. I have made white rice and steel cut oats and the results were awesome! I just purchased some whole grain brown rice and can't wait to try it. I would like to thank all previous reviewers because the information contained is very valuable for a new user. Lots of good tips about rice and the machine itself. You cannot go wrong buying this product. Very good gift idea as well!Update: Brown rice turned out great first try! Clean up really is a breeze!!
5,Amazing Little Rice Cooker,"This little gem is amazing. It is easy to clean, use and the end product is perfect every time. Be sure to read the instructions well before the first use for a great result. I love the timer feature. It is compact. The best purchase I have made for my kitchen this year."
5,Where have you been all of my life?,"Since living in Hawaii in the 1990's, I've always considered a rice cooker to be a required appliance in my kitchen. My old Aroma served me well until I started cooking exclusively with brown/whole grained rice. I grew tired of having to throw out the bottom ""crackly"" layer of rice whenever I cooked whole grain, and found this gem! I love the timer, which allows me to have my brown rice perfectly cooked by the time I arrive home from work, and I love the size, which is perfect for a 1-4 person household. I haven't yet tried the ""porridge"" feature to cook my steel-cut oats, but I am optimistic, having read other reviews. Well worth the money!"
4,Excellent for Rice Cook,"I just bought this rice cooker and I love it. It is so easy to cook rice. And I really love the taste, the rice tastes so soft. Also I use this to cook porridge nearly every evening. The only thing I am a little disappointed about this cooker is that it takes a long time to cook brown rice for about 2 hours. So if you want to have brown rice for lunch, you'd better cook it in the morning."
5,Great rice announced by happy song,I've yet to screw up making rice with this thing. Add water and rice then wait for the song.Keeps rice in a great state for hours. If you are quick after eating and have left overs you can switch to extended time mode and enjoy the rice the next day with out too much loss of awesome in the rice.Happy dinner time announced by a song. I love it.
4,Fantasic rice cooker!,Great rice cooker. Even cooking and perfectly done every time [brown and white rice]. When programming however there is some confusion as to whether or not the time entered is the time it starts cooking RATHER than the time the rice with be finished. KEY POINT!Small footprint and convenient size for 2 -3 adults.
5,for the inexperinced,"I am a neophyte rice maker. The NS-LAC05 is essentially foolproof. The instruction manual requires careful reading and some interpretation but is quite usable. I have had no problems at all and am very happy with the cooker. One word of caution. The term ""porridge"" does NOT refer to porridge as used in English but is a Japanese rice porridge. The ""porridge"" setting is usable but the timing is off for oatmeal."
5,It's a steel cut oat cooker!,"I chose the NS-LAC05 after a serious Google expedition. I chose Amazon for price, quick delivery AND the consumer reviews.After another serious review of consumer comments, I determined the ideal recipe to be 1 Zoji cup McCann's steel cut oats to 2 1/2 Zoji cups of water. I set the 'menu' to 'porridge.'61 minutes later, I had a perfect bowl of thick oats {I prefer my oats thick}.My second attempt was a disaster! I learned the cooker defaults to 'white rice' when you turn it off. It promptly boiled over spewing oat milk all over.So, the machine makes perfect thick creamy steel cut oats. Just remember to ALWAYS make sure the 'menu' is set to 'porridge' before pressing the 'cooking' button."
4,cute efficient small great rice cooker,"Very efficient very attractive . Rice cooked very well.But I could not find in the instruction book which came with it, that water will collect in top tray and then what to do with it and how to clean it. May be I missed itor ...."
3,Lasted 3 years,"It does make very good rice, but takes longer as others have stated. We are Asian and used it almost daily for close to 3 years and it is now broken...does not work. I think it may be because we were not too careful with cleaning it as I found burnt rice on the bottom of the cooker, so maybe it was due to that."
5,Great little rice cooker,"It cooks rice perfectly. One tip they don't point out in the directions: You measure the rice with the included cup, put the rice in the cooking bowl, THEN add the water to the line marked in the cooking bowl. It'll make mushy rice if you put the water in first!"
3,Works but has issues,"When reading this review, please note I only cook brown (whole grain) rice so I can't say if white rice would be different. First it take a long time to cook - about one and a half hours to cook 1/2 to 1 cup of brown rice. The rice is gummy not fluffy but maybe that is how brown rice is, I don't know. The rice does taste great though."
4,Great little rice cooker,I got this little rice cooker because I just could not make consistent rice in the microwave or on the stove top. This rice cooker produces perfect rice everytime from long grain to sushi rice. The quality is just as good as a larger rice maker but you can make rice for just one or two if you would like.I do find it annoying that the rice cup is not actually 1 cup.
4,"Works, but misleading capacity","The maximum capacity for any type of white rice is 2 cups only, 3 cups for other types. It seems to cook rice perfectly. We had a previous Zojirushi cooker (5-cup) which always appeared to need more water than the instructions requested. Adding extra water isn't such a good idea with this particular cooker.Notes: Plays ""Mary Had A Little Lamb"" when rice is done. I am not making this up.Displays time of day in military (24-hr) format.Has a retractable power cord that actually works."
5,Riceamus maximus,"Ok, this is an awful lot to pay for making rice. But be prepared to start throwing oatmeal at weddings after using this machine because rice will seem too good to just be throwing at people. My house smells like nutty popcorn each time I make a batch of brown rice. The rice has a nice sticky quality that makes using chop sticks a viable option since you can actually get mouthfuls instead of clamping one grain at a time. If you reduce the amount of water to a little less than recommended the rice will be tender but not mealy. The timer is incredible and allows you to wake up to or come home to clean and delicious rice if that is your carbo of choice. And it should be!"
1,Ad description VAGUE!,"As you can see in the description it says, ""...3-Cup (Uncooked) Rice Cooker ..."". Since so many rice cookers say the amount of cooked rice this led me to believe that one could put 3 cups of uncooked rice into the pot with an appropriate amount of water and turn it on. When I received the product and opened up the lid to look inside it had only a 3-Cup ""COOKED rice"" pot inside. It IS a 3-Cup (COOKED) Rice Cooker and Warmer, Not a 3 cup Uncooked Rice Cooker. Why they used the word ""Uncooked"" is beyond me. One star because of this. I don't know how well it works since I did not use it. People told me this brand is good and if 3 cups of ""COOKED"" rice is all you need then it's probably a good choice for you."
1,Deceptive Description,"This rice cooker advertises it is a 3 cup cooker, which is what I wanted, but no where in the descriptipn does it mention that it cooks ony 2 cups of WHITE rice, which is what I always use. It's hardly worth the effort & $$$ to cook 2 cups of rice, in a 3 cup cooker I might add. I found this out when reading the instructions that came with the product, but not from the Amazon description. I think this is deceptive & should be added to the online description."
1,I Must Have Missed The Memo...,"Somewhere in all the research I did I must have missed the part where they said this rice cooker was going to work well. We only cook whole grain rices and the brown rice I made was worse than wallpaper paste. Never seen such a gluey, nasty mess in my life. The directions for this are dodgy at best. Somewhere I also got the impression that this was going to be a fabulous improvement on cooking rice the regular way. No one mentioned that it takes twice as long. Maybe this is a good product if you are cooking white rice, but if you plan to use it for whole grains and brown rice don't waste your time. I'll be going back to my regular steamer with it's rice insert. That wasn't great either, but way better than this. On my way to return this now."
2,Rice steamer ok,This is a very nice steamer. But the cup measurement is NOT our cup measure so when it says steams 3 cups it actually does about 2 (maybe is asian cup size) so this is not a good size for an average family of 4.
3,good cooker bit two small,zojirushi makes great rice cookers but I found this one too small (family of two adults)I returned this and got the 5.5 cup size which works fine for 1 cup of rice and also works for lots of one dish meals)I would say go for the bigger one
