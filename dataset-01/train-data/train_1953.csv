2,Even More 5 Minute Mysteries,"The stories usually dragged out and when you got to the solution, they were usually disappointing. I like the 2 minute mysteries much better."
2,missing the most important piece,"Straps are fine, however it you look closely, it does not include the most important part of the strap. That would be the part with the threaded rod for the front strap, which is the piece that will twist off when you try to remove it. The rod is attached to the ""hanging"" part of the strap and is not something that is easily fabricated. This makes the purchase basically worthless."
2,Barely worth reading,"In the introduction to this book, Mr. Senior states (rather proudly I might add) that he has so very professionally hacked away 2 thirds( aw, just a few sentences..) of the entire story. He claims that much of it was needless details (such as descriptions of battles, ect.) but rambles on to announce that he has cleanly ripped away a few other side plots not necessary to to the well-being of the whole (as he sees it); any of the adventures of Sir Gareth, you won't find here. Other knights seem to drop into the story, and while all of the characters in the tale will appear to know who they are, you are left in the dark, because they happened to be on the editor's 'bad list' and their earlier excursions were deleted.But then Mr. Senior finishes with this; that we must ""not bewail these losses"" (after all, he knows what he's doing). I suppose 2 thirds of Sir Thomas Malory's work was in vain."
2,Do not buy - It doesn't work,It is quite a good game for kids but is not worth top dollar. Also it crashes if you play it for more than an hour. I had to return it.
3,Couldn't save games on my XBox 360,"I thought I ordered an XBox 360 version of the original Lego Star Wars. I didn't look closely enough at the picture to see it says simply ""XBOX"". While I could play the game on my XBox 360, I could not save any of my progress. This is not the fault of the shipper, I received what I ordered and 10 days before it was scheduled to arrive. I wish the information on the Amazon site was more specific about this being an original XBOX game."
5,Great Game,I know you see lego in the title and you think that this game is not for adults. I have seen previous reviews for this game and everyone gave this atleast 4 1/2 stars so I told me wife that we should get this for our son. Little did she know that I wanted to play this also. We just bought the game and I have been playing it for the last three hours while my son is in bed sleeping. It is a great game and I love how many unlockable characters there are. When my son is awake and ready to play he can understand the button secquence very easily. This is a great game and suggest it for people of all ages.
4,Fun Game,This is a fun game - not as many gags as the original series video game but a similar premise. The game also does not take as long as the original series.
5,This is not just a kids game! You will LOVE this game!,"This game is fun for the whole family. I figured at first that my little boy would be the only one to really play this game. My husband and I both thought it would be fun but we did'nt realize just how much fun until we are now hooked to playing it!!! The sounds of the light sabers are just like the real movie and the people all look just like real legos! The game is'nt very difficult but it holds your interest. There is over 30+ playable charaters to use. The game combines all 3 of the first movies in to one full game. I really like that about it, its like having 3 different games but for one price. There is tons of hidden things to find in this game. I highly recommend it for kids and adults!"
1,Somewhat disappointed!,Before we brought this product we searched thw Xbox 360 website to see if it was compatible with XBox 360 since it was a previous Xbox game. We have not been able to get it to work. Still trying..............
3,Cool in theory,"The game is a great concept but once you get over that it is kind of dull.I think the game is aimed at kids, so for little ones it may be worth it. I got bored with it after about a half hour and haven't played it since."
1,crap,"This by far is the worst Star Wars game out there. The Pod Racing part is annoying and too long (I gave up after about 20 tries), it's almost impossible to catch up with the main pod racer. There is way too much coin or what ever you want to call it collecting. There was no need for this, the lego concept I thought was pretty cool but they could have done without the above mentioned and this game would have been alot better."
2,Poor Quality,"I ordered this item and was quite disappointed with the quality. The material is scratchy even after a washing and rather thin. The ""matching sheets"" couldn't be any thinner. Not worth the price tag."
1,Sorry I Bought This One,I won't be reading this book to my daughter. The idea of beating a child for getting her dress dirty is not one I want to impart to my child. Very sad!
5,Loved it!!,"I was born and raised in Central America and was searching for books that I could read to my daughter, that I could relate too. This book hit the spot! I love it because I have been able to share with my daughter rhymes that I heard my grandmother and mother say to me, that I had forgotten. My daughter is now 7 and we have memorized them and enjoy reciting them to each other in Spanish. There is one rhyme that is a little harsh, however, one must remember that these rhymes have been passed down from one generation to another, just like the Mother Goose rhymes,and unfortunately, this one particular rhyme gets lost in translation and sounds horrible in English. The Spanish language is a beautiful language and very rarely do the words translate into English very well, so please don't take it to seriously. So if you are looking to share your culture with your child or learn about another culture, this book should do the job.The bottom line is...we love it!"
3,Spanish Nursery Rhymes,"I liked that the rhymes are written in both Spanish and English, though they lose something in the translation. A wonderful way to share a bit of culture with your children."
3,Good activities but not well made software,I got this for my 4 year old daughter. Though the pack has 3 CDs it has less games then some of her single CD programs. Also the software is not well made. The complexity levels do not truly make the games more interesting for her. SHe was bored with them quite quickly.
4,profound and insightful,"this book is extremely detailed in its approach to the tarot. its depth into the major arcana is enlightening at the very worst. the book offers a more traditional, almost textbook-ish interpretation of the cards first and then a more modern and practical perspective later on. the only thing that is regretable is its lack of minor arcana explanations which would probably be the only thing that would keep me from saying that this book could be considered an authority on the tarot. in spite of this fact however i do not feel it to be a mistake to say that one would only benefit from this authors insight."
2,Blah,"My main interest in this was to hear an updated version of a Carcass classic ""Incarnated Solvent Abuse"". We all know Michael Amott and his lineage with his previous band, Carcass. And though this version is certainly not better, Angela was actually able to do the song a fair amount of justice, which surprised me considering how bland she is as a vocalist. The guitars on it are noticeably sped up, but it didn't bother me to hear a fresh take on a classic. Make no mistake, the original is leagues above this. I could not help but laugh at the Megadeth cover. It truly ranks among the worst of all covers I have ever heard. As for the title song that this EP was named after, it is merely an OK song. Had they included it on the followup album Doomsday Machine it would no doubt been among the best that album had to offer, but let's remember, that album was not very good."
3,Same old stuff,"I have a copy of Frommer's Italy '98 and it reads almost exactly the same as the ""new and improved"" 2006 edition. The copy is virtually unchanged under the section Best Travel Experiences. Apparently, the only changes that have been made are the lire is now the euro and the prices have been updated on food and lodging. I guess this book would be helpful if it's your one and only choice."
1,Useless,"I am a watercolorist and I recently began working with pastels. I wanted a book that would help me choose materials, as well as demonstrate techniques I could use in getting started in this medium. I found this book useless. I wish I hadn't bought it. The organization, the lack of demonstrations, and the general visual quality of the book was not inviting. Very disappointing. Go with something else."
2,STAY AWAY,"I recently bought this book and ""Painting the Landscape in Pastel."" Both of these books are devoid of any real discussion on technique. There is page after page of discussion on color, hue, value, etc. That is all well and good but there is no thorough discussion or demonstration of how to actually apply pastel to paper, only a page or two that glosses over the subject in a couple of paragraphs. There are a couple of demonstration paintings in which the author goes through a painting's different stages but it seems a book of this nature should include more than a couple of such demonstrations.Don't waste your time or money on this one. There are other books out there that are superior for the beginner."
1,Beautiful art but not any help...,Mr Blovits is a great artist and his paintings are stunning. But I am a serious beginner and this book was of little help. I need a step by step book that tells me the color and techniques used...There is nowhere near enough step by step technique but the man can paint and shows what is possible in pastel.
3,"not enough ""how to""","Good coverage of concepts, but not enough specifics on color applications, etc. No step by step instructions."
2,Definitey an accurate title,Interesting. I always find something to enjoy in a book. The color palette was on the dark side but for my students it is a good way for students to see pastels used. It is a good book to have in a classroom but for my tastes it was not the greatest pastel book.
2,Everyday,"Eventhough it's made by Lenox, it's not the high quality you expect from the brand. The dishes feel like inexpensive painted stoneware. There are obvious paint splotches on the cup handles that chip right out of the box. For the price it's good for everyday holiday use..."
2,Poor quality; disappointing,"I was disappointed with this purchase. The quality of Winter Greetings Everyday did not measure up to my expectations. The glazing was not consistent from one piece to another; consequently, some dishes had a high sheen while others had more of a matte finish. On one of the salad plates, the paint had been scraped before glazing leaving an obvious white spot and a glob of paint visible under the glaze. I wonder if the dishes I received were intended to be sold as seconds. The design and colors of this pattern are beautiful. I may search for this pattern in stores so that I can inspect the dishes before buying them."
2,Too little music,Mostly interviews. Only 1-2 full songs. The rest is talking and snippets of songs. I like the band. I like the album. I expected more from this DVD.
3,Alarm did not set properly.,"I received the product, Pedometer and the alarm did not set property. Everything else works fine."
1,Don't spend the money,I bought this pedometer and it's been a headache to use. It's longer than it is deep so it doesn't stay on your pants. It falls off constantly and finally fell off 3 times and broke.I liked the talking function and counted on the alarm when I walk alone in the dark but it wasn't worth it.
5,SNA 765,"I have worn Seiko since 1970. The accuracy,value and aesthetics of the Seiko line is without peer. I have tried others, most recently with Invicta (bezel and retaining clip fell off the first day - watchband unnattachable) and have come back to the quality and comfort of Seiko. Only regret is I did not find the SNA 765 while it was considerably less expensive. Seiko does not make these anymore and the remainders go for a premium. Only had the chronograph for a short while but seems like a more than worthy successor to the watch I wore out of Vietnam."
5,GOTTA HAVE IT,"The best tracks from all her previous albums PLUS one [or two] covered tunes [now made her own!] and two brand new songs! Oh, come-on! You've gotta have this album!"
5,Very Impressed,The new eco-friendly packaging is such a welcome site. The CD of course is a wonderful compilation of Melissa's greatest hits along with some powerful new ones. Definitely worth the purchase.
5,SHE'S BACK!!!,"Ever since her outstanding Grammy performance Melissa has come back on top. This album only represents the songs of her career that caught the eye of ""All Humanity"". It does have her better songs on it, but if you ask me All of Melissa's songs are greatest hits! The special edition of this cd is what you need to get. It includes a trivia game, an interview by Melissa herself, and also videos of some of her greatest hits... for all Melissa fans the special edition is a must have!"
4,She is a legend,"I have been listening to Melissa since 1988. She is classic. This album touches upon a few of her best. ""I Need To Wake Up"" is amazing!"
3,Where's the other songs?,"I just bought this cd today. I really like it, except for 3 of the missing singles: Breathe, I Want to Be In Love & Your Little Secret. I wish she had included them in this collection. However, it's worth it for the new material."
3,Great Artist- leaves youwondering where the rest of the songs are,"Melissa Etheridge has been a genuine rock star through her music, lyrics, live shows, videos and inspirational in her personal life. I expected a different song selecton for her Greatest Hits... Where is ""I Want to Be In Love"", ""Breakdown"", ""Scarecrow"", ""Tuesday Morning"", ""Your Little Secret"", ""This Moment"", ""Breathe"" and ""The Weakness In Me""? You got to still LOVE her. Melissa is worthy of such a more involved collection to highlight her incredible music."
4,My Little Secret......,"As much as I appreciate the fact that Melissa has finally brought out a Greatest Hits CD, I ask myself...hmmm....Where are they (the hits, that is)? There is not a single song from ""Skin"". How is this possible? Dance with Sleeping, Nowhere To Go, Your Little Secret, Ruins, The Weakness in Me and I Want To Be In Love...I could go on but then only hardcore fans would understand.I am extremely happy for the studio version of the Janis Joplin song and she tears it up as usual. Why some albums were more popular than others is beyond me but this woman has more talent in her eyelash than some of these so-called artists of today.Overall, the GH is good, but ""Yes I Am"" will forever be my favorite Album by her. I recommend anyone interested in discovering the magic of Melissa to try this album first. You can't go wrong."
4,Good for hits,"If you don't like Melissa Etheridge, but like her hit music, this is the one album you should own. It's all the tracks that had radio play and became popular without getting the rest of her albums. Nice when you want to sample her stuff."
5,"Passion and courage, and that's just the beginning!","She writes from the soul. Full of passion and courage, these songs represent an already phenomenal career. Etheridge identifies with the longing we all have for the one that we love. She also provides a touch of comfort for those standing by as we watch a loved one go through another chemo treatment. She still fights for life, and she does that by running. Oh, Piece of My Heart is on here. You cannot lose with this album."
4,Great Collection,"This is a great collection from an amazing singer/songwriter. If you have never purchased a Melissa Etheridge CD, this is a good compilation for you with early hits and a couple of covers as well. The price of this CD is worth it, if for nothing else, than the Grammy's version of ""Piece of My Heart"". Though she sang it with a bald head from chemo, it was the soul you can hear in her voice that is most impressive. If you are an ardent Melissa fan or someone new to her music, this is a good buy."
5,Thanks again Melissa,"WARNING: THIS IS A BIASED FAN REVIEW!!Once again Melissa gives her fans what, in her best guestimate, we want. We never have to wonder if she listened to us or considered us in her work. Given everyone and everything that she must think about in her life it amazes me how she ALWAYS makes us feel appreciated and special too. It's no wonder that so many of us care so much about her -- we're just giving back what she gives us. All I can say is thank you again Melissa!"
2,Nothing like Shri Durga!,"Let me guess: you're thinking of buying this record because you loved DJ Cheb I Sabbah's Shri Durga and want more. Don't do it! That is unless you really like bland dance music with a slightly jazzy feel. Basically every song on Shri Durga is superior to anything on this rather uninspired effort. Outside the context of comparison to Shri Durga, it's not that bad, as far as mellow, jazzy dance music goes, but if you're looking for more Shri Durga, you'll be better off looking elsewhere. Krishna Lila would be an excellent choice."
5,Om Shanti,I was eager & curious when I first played MahaMaya - - to hear other people's remixes of Shri Durga- one of my most played cds. I was pleased to hear the various interpretations. I find many of them super danceable & as with Shri Durga- great to listen to. I appreciate the different depth and range these tracks offer. And I really like how dj Cheb i Sabbah brings forth fresh mixes of his own songs- love his new elements! Can't wait to hear what he creates next!
1,Missed opportunities,"I had high hopes of this remix cd considering the names that appeared in the credits. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. This album is a prime example of mediocrity at best. This album seemed to have direction, pointing to a height it wanted to achieve, but never quite made it. It remained a bit too anchored to its roots, while not being able to reach the realm of true electronica. The mixing seemed too generic, not bringing enough unique flavors to it. Too often, the songs reach a plateau, and you wait for it to peak, but nothing comes, and you end up feeling dissapointed and a bit cheated. This album is throughly confused, trying to be both ethnic yet on the cutting edge of asian-electronca. It failed to be either."
2,Had this been the original I would have given it 5 stars,"The idea of setting the music of Shri Durga to dance beats was somewhat intriguing to me, but I was mostly just itching to hear more Cheb Sabbah. Because Shri Durga is such an incredible cd I was sure that he would have a different twist to show us in the remix. However, the artists who did the remix didn't seem to use much creativity when going about it. The music was looped and placed over a dance beat........but nothing more."
1,poseur,"Seen this fellow in concert, have his albums. Cheb i Sabbah personifies the ""Orientalist"" mentality described by Edward Said. He is a poseur."
2,Ughh......,"The one below is mine. I got this so called ""phone"" and to my suprise, it was terrible. Now, my friends think of it the same way. When I would ride to the library which IS in the 2 mile radious from my house (from my house to library: 1.61 miles) and I couldnt ask my parents to come pick me up! I had to borrow money from like 10 kids there in order to use the pay phone. The reason I rate this a 2 in fun is because it takes pics. Now, im wondering.....WHY WOULD THEY PUT A B&W SCREEN ON?? The pics are very blurry, and I could'nt even send them to my friends RIGHT ACROSS FROM ME!!! 2 phones??? No. 2 WALKIE TALKIES???? Its not all its cracked up to be. They are more toys than phones. Thanx for taking the time to read this!"
3,Chat Now Phone,"This phone won't do you anygood if none of your friends have the phone. So, unless they get the phone you may not have anyone you can talk to."
2,For older kids,"The idea for this is great...and it might be wonderful for older children. We got this for our 4 year old who loves to talk on the phone. But there are so many instructions and specialty numbers (buddy numbers) that she cannot use it. Sheis very bright and a reader, but this product was too advanced for her. I tried reading the instructions and got lost as well."
2,A CHRISTMAS gift for my daughters.,"I bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the Dollar Tree. When i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures I decided to give them a try. I have two complaints with this product. One, the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and I could'nt get one of the phones to communicate. The pictures are a little grainy but what do you expect with a play phone."
4,5678,"This 5678 single CD is worth every penny you pay for it. Although it only has one song, you can repeat this same song over and over again and never get tired of it."
4,The Movie Woody Allen Wishes He Could Make,"The Plot Against Harry keeps the viewer guessing well into the first half hour whether it's a comedy, drama or documentary ...and by then you don't care...it's just interesting. It's funny,fast and kooky. The characters are very real people and I had no trouble imagining that they had full complex lives beyond what was depicted in the film. A classic."
4,Great for engineers!,As an windows engineer i found these books to be a real addition to my knowledge of the windows platform. I use it's information on a weekly bases.
4,Good detail,"Unlike most books that start with how to install the product, this book goes into much more detail on how to craft a PKI infrastructure. What documents should be approved by legal and what should be in them. Then, it goes on to describe the proper way to install Cert Server from Microsoft and this is not just run setup. If you have to do a PKI for your company, this is the book to get!"
5,Awesome!,I bought the all black Nixon banks watch for my husband for his birthday. It arrived 3 days after I purchased it in perfect condition. My husband loves the watch and gets compliments on it all the time.
5,An excellent story....,"I attended Margaret Takaki's book launching where I was introduced to the book. I began reading the book when I was indoors with a cold. I could not stop reading it even though I am not an avid reader. The characters and situations were so real, I had to know what happened. The book is great."
5,Remembering when.....,"The author, Margaret Takaki, presented a great story line that followed Meg Sebastian and her family, from her early days, through many character building situations in her life. The story continues effortlessly, with lots of human interactions in Meg's life, and that truly makes for a good read. Good Job."
4,Total SNMP: Exploring the Simple Network Management Protocol,I want to have more details with this book and all the chatper to be reviews completely and clearly.
4,good for beginners,"I would say I am at an intermediate level of fitness and have a couple other pilates videos. This instructor is non-annoying and explains the moves very clearly --- first doing ""half"" the move, then going into the full move e.g., legs and arms not fully extended to show motion, then fully extends arms and legs to do the harder, complete motion.That said, I felt like every time I felt myself starting to break a sweat, the set would be over. Never really felt like I got a serious workout. The moves are fine, it's just that more of them needed to be done or something. Great for beginners, though, learning the moves or just getting back in shape and need something challenging but not discouraging."
2,Get another book,"I was really excited to get this book and explore the world of collage. I am a mixed media artist so I am familiar with materials. The pictures are gorgeous, but I found the instructions vague and lacking in detail. There is the collage picture and opposite is the materials list with bulleted instructions. One page per picture. One page for instructions (this is the area that needed more detail) And that is it.Look at the house shaped box collage called ""Crossings"". The material list is there but the written instructions don't match the list. I expect to learn in the instructions how the 3 3/4"" x 48"" birch plywood is cut and used. Forget that. . .there is only vague information about how the box comes together. The pictures are inspiring and showcases great collage artwork. I celebrate that but hey the meat is in the instructions and sharing the techniques with others. If you are looking to learn about collage get another book."
2,Disappointing!,"If you are buying every book on this subject, this could be among them. However, if making a choice, this should not be a priority. The projects are not inspiring, a challenge considering the fine artists composing them. They show some interesting techniques, but who wants to use them considering what we're offered as goals? I would recommend ""True Colors"", by Harrison,"" Altered Books Workshop"", by Brazelton, and ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"", (a marvelous compilation of 42 projects put together by Thunder Bay Press) as being FAR more worthwhile."
4,The beginning of an empire...,"This book chronicles the founding of the Galactic Patrol, and sets the stage for the Lensman books to follow. I read it because of Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski's strong recommendation, and have not been disappointed. In fact, Babylon 5 fans will see a lot of parallels between B5 and the Lensman series. About the only criticism I can think of for Smith's work is that his books move along at a comfortable pace until the last couple of chapters, when the action starts happening at ""light-speed"". It always leaves me feeling like I've been waiting a long time for the ending and it's over almost before I can enjoy it. But that's a minor criticism, and it hasn't stopped me from reading the rest of this fascinating series of books!"
3,Let's Not Go Overboard,"""Best SF Ever""? I don't think so, but it did start the wholeSpace Opera genre and for that we should be grateful. However,the whole Lensman series is not very well written ( how manytimes can you say ""coruscating rays of death""? ) and I can onlyrecommend reading it to someone between the ages of 12 and 16.After that you move on to more weighty Space Opera. You start toread Bear and Heinlein and Pournelle - remembering fondly( of course ), that without Doc Smith, they would not exist."
3,Super Reader,"Virgil Samms is one of the head honchos of the Triplanetary organisation. He is the man the Arisians have decided will become the first wearer of the Lens, being of the right ethical and genetic stuff.Samms must overcome political problems on Earth, where Rod Kinnison is an honest politician, and husband the creation of the Galactic Patrol. The Lens is a dream come come true, a badge of office that it is impossible for criminals to duplicate.The scope for this book is therefore still not as broad as what is yet to come, and is still setting the stage."
4,A great read for any sci-fi buff.,"After reading this you will see where George Lucas and Gene Roddenberry were comming from. It's the 'Roots' of science fiction. E. E. Smith style takes some getting used to, but after the first 50 pages or so it's a very easy read."
5,"Every SF fan needs to have read these, and will love them","Doc Smith is basic to the genre. He's the first of the 2 1/2 supernovae to hit the field (the half being Stanley G. Weinbaum, the other full one being Heinlein of course). His tales of intergalactic, even interuniversal, adventure are more thoughtful than they look on the surface. And Smith is actually a powerful and controlled prose writer. He sometimes tends towards the purple, and often the informal, but his sentences do what he intended them to do. Read these books!By the way, his last book was written in 1965, not 1948 as claimed in an earlier review (_Skylark Duquesne_)."
5,Great,I have read all german Editions from the Lensmen Cycle. Now I've read the Original Edition and was really disapointed for our German Translators. They should have let it be to try to translate the Origin. To many passes of the Origin are missing. I really don't know why. Perhaps anybody could tell me if there is any possibility or allowance to translate the whole Edition in German (Latest known Edition for me ist 1985)
5,One of the best Sci-Fi series ever written,"Very entertaining and through provoking. A must read.This series laid the foundation for many other Sci-Fi books/stories, in my opinion. Especially StarWars."
2,3 broken frames,"The concept and price are the good factors. Unfortunately I have 3 broken frames even with being extremely careful with them. Now they are no longer manufacturing this frame, so I have useless lenses and went and bought Randolph glasses"
1,Sálvese quien pueda...,"Marta Sánchez ataca de nuevo. La musiquilla es buena, si estás borracho perdido y sólo quieres moverte de un lado a otro. Pero la letra.... ay, la letra!! Cursi, vacía, pésima, y, sobre todo, llana... ha fracasado en el intento.Despierta, Marta... que lo único que tienes en común con Madonna es que tu nombre comienza con M."
1,Weak and pre-fabricated,If you have ever been to the shopping mall and pass the organ/keyboard shop and hear the automatic demo that the Casio-5600 or whatever is playing will give you an idea of what type CD this is. THIS IS FAR FROM CLASSIC LEE PERRY MATERIAL UNLIKE WHAT SOME OF THE REVIEWS CLAIM THIS PROJECT TO BE.
5,The best lowering springs!,"I have tried a few lowering springs like Tein, Skunk2, and Kings. And this by far is the best I have had. It drops the car at a practical height - not too low nor too high. I can still go over humps and driveways with no problems. The ride quality is great. It blends well with the factory shocks and it feels like I am using factory springs. I could barely feel the bumps and holes on the road. The handling is excellent. Body roll is reduced on cornering and the car stops quicker when hitting the brakes. If you are looking for a cheap and effective suspension upgrade and don't wanna pay a fortune for coilovers, then this is the one for you.PS. If you want to go a lot lower, get the Eibach Sportsline. But you need to use aftermarket shocks with it though."
1,It's not James Lee Burke,"When the publisher compared Cook's writing favorably to James Le Burke, I was hooked. And I stayed hooked through part of the book, but then I thought the story came a part. Too many first time novelists try to ""out kill"" established writers, I suppose, because they think ""more gore"" sells. I'm not at all opposed to a high kill ratio, but I thought Cook made a real mess of the ending. If Cook is James Lee Burke, then I'm Stephen King."
4,Definately TEXAS NOIR,"Christopher Cook has written a first novel which clearly falls into the Texas Noir style. If that doesn't exist, then he invented it. It felt in some ways like a tragedy but the interest was there for me in the characters and in the locale.There was a haunting realism which is where the Noir comes in for me. The range of life and types of people are straight out of the Lone Star State.I had some difficulty with the plot progression but it was a powerful read."
3,the first chapter is good but ...,"The first chapter is good but it goes downhill from there. There are no redeeming qualities to these characters. So, in that respect, I think the book fails. Now, I like bad guys just as much as anyone. But there has to be something good about them, otherwise, I don't care what happens to them. Accordingly, I didn't care what happened to these guys. In other words, they are not three dimensional characters. They are merely caricatures. Which is OK for minor characters, but not the protagonists."
3,Good but not Great,"The Author's grasp of the Icelandic sagas is not complete and in some places misleading. For example page 86 where she states that Grettir the Strong dies of gangrene poisoning. The manner of his death is a significant part of the saga - and he did not die from gangrene. She includes Gudrun from the Laxdaela Saga as a witch-figure. The Author also contends (page 145) that '...the Edda and saga literature describe very few other lascivious witch figures...' than Freya, and that she is an anomoly.If there were insights on seidh or herb-lore, I missed them.I recommend reading the sagas (check out Penguin Classics or Everyman Press) to learn about the Icelandic witch figure. Two books I recommend are: 'The Witch Figure' edited by V. Newall (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1973); and 'Lady With a Mead Cup' by Michael J. Enright (Four Courts Press, 1996)."
1,Very Plain,Only gives a small square of a screen saver. It doens't even take up the whole screen. The graphics look terrible. Would not recommend it at all.
1,Screensavers Collections Falls Very Short,"The ""screensavers"" are low quality and not worth the price, time, and money - but they get a 1 for at least not carrying a virus."
3,"Not real happy with this, it's ok but would not buy again.Not recommended.To hard to use. Thought it was Not user friendly","Not real happy with this, it's ok but would not buy again.Not recommended.To hard to use. Not user friendly. Thought it was Not"
4,For a 7 year old,"I got this game for my gf's 7 year old who barely speaks any English. He has been able to navigate his way through the game fine still and its small puzzles and really loves it. The game has '3 episodes', he has beat I and III already in just 2 days (with me helping him in 2 player mode through some of the harder parts). The chapters where you were racing against time or flying the ships were the most difficult thing hes encountered and took trying again and again for some time but he eventually got the hang of them...or bugged me to do it while he watched if he got tired of crashing too many times. lolI'm looking for more playstation 2 games that would be easy and fun to play for a child in this age range (he's 7) that is just beginning to learn English. If anyone sees this and has any ideas feel free to comment or drop me a message!"
5,Great and fun game,"My son and his friends love this game, we received a great deal on it since we bought a used copy."
5,My son LOVE'S it!,"This game was for my son. We had been looking for this one everywhere with no success until we came here to Amazon. We ordered it through ""angiesgamesandmovies"" and they delivered sooner than expected and the game was in great condition. I will be looking for them next time I need a game."
1,Won't run on older PS2s without modifications,"I, like so many others below have had problems with this game.I wish I had read these before purchasing!Before searching online and reading these reviews, we had already driven to the store to exchange once because we thought the disk was defective. All my son wanted for his birthday was this game, and he was so upset when it wouldn't run.Apparently this is a well documented problem with the blue CDs, as mentioned below. DON""T buy if you have an older PS2 - or at least learn the ""workarounds"" before your wasting time!"
4,"Fun, but short","I bought this game because of all the glowing reviews it was getting. I'm a huge Star Wars fan as well, so it was a no-brainer. The game is fun, clever, looks great, but is WAY too short. Definitely a game for younger players, but still fun to run through in a couple hours."
1,Poor Compatibility,"I have the original PS2 console, which works beautifully for all games and DVD's EXCEPT LEGOS STAR WARS! We tried three different brand new copies of the game and none of them would load - all had to be returned. We kept getting a ""Disk Read Error"" message. Extremely frustrating. If it's billed as a PS2 game, it should be compatible with ALL PS2 consoles or it should state clearly that it does not work with the original version of the console!"
2,Dont buy this game at this time,"I bought the game a local store- the PS2 wouldnt load it. i tried it in another sytem same thing. then i bought another one on Amazon.com. this was the same. After repeatred attempts and a new system it finally loaded only to have to free off an on. i dont know what eidos, lego or lucas did but you should wait until they fix the problem. i am testing the game at this moment. i dont want to give it to my son only to not have it work."
1,Lego Starwars does not work on PS2,My son wanted this game for his birthday. It is extremely disappointing that this game does NOT work on PS2. The game should boldly specify that it won't work.
5,A great game!,This game came to me quickly and in good shape. My kids enjoy the fun and graphics and we have not had any problems.
4,"Episodes 1,2 and 3","This game is pretty cool.Here's what I think about the episodes.Episode 1,pretty addicting until the pod racing part.Episode 2,really horrible for the most part.The only chapter where you could really have fun in was jedi battle (because you get Mace Windu).Episode 3,now I know why they pointed this episode out so much.In this episode you really get more fun out of sony.Ship ones are easy and battles are fun.There's alot more action in this one.I can't wait to get to the battle at the end of episode,3.Oh and by the way I am ONLY 8 years old."
4,not as challenging as other lego star wars games,"this is a fun game but i have played other lego star wars games that are more challenging, still it is very entertaining"
3,It's o.k.,"It's not the best games out there but it does keep you entertained! When I beat this one,I'm gonna try part 2 and see if there is an improvement.It's overall fun and the fact that you can play with a buddy is even better!! I suggest getting this if you liked Batman Lego!"
3,Lego Star Wars,"Having played the other Lego games this was a bit of a let down. It was the first game in the series so it only makes sense that it is not as good as the others. But, if judged on its own it is still enjoyable and worth playing."
5,Great for young children,My son just turned 5 years old. This is an easy game for him to learn and very entertaining for adults. Great choice for young children.
5,Fun for the whole family,"It's fun and adventerous. My uncle play this game with me and likes the way the puzzles are and using the force (O). He gets a high score with this game and is fun in every aspect of play. I give this game a high rating because it is fun, looks as close to star wars as you can get and the music is very action like."
4,"Comical appearance but a really good, playable game.","Excellent animation, down to reflections in the floors. ALL of the action is played out by little Lego Star Wars characters, which is hilarious. It's not another cheap movie tie-in that was cranked out on half a wing and cheap incense, but is actually a lot more fun (I think) than the ""real"" Star Wars Revenge of the Sith game."
5,The Saga Begins,"This is a terrific game for anyone that is a fan of Star Wars and Legos. The game is not overly challenging. It is perfect to introduce kids to the wonderful world of Star Wars. I have a seven year old and a nine year old. My kids and I are having a terrific time playing through all the levels. The ability to drop in and out during game play is great. I have Lego Star Wars II for my PSP and can see how the game has advanced from this first incarnation. When I complete Lego Star Wars, I will definitely be moving on to Lego Star Wars II for the Playstation 2. For some the game play may not be as challenging as they would like, but I definitely recommend the game. The videos are great and the game play is tons of fun."
5,Surprisingly Good!,Read the reviews and had to get it for my boys (7 & 10). As said in other reviews this is a kids game and it is easy. But it is so creative in the lego format that I'm enjoying playing it with the kids. What makes it great for me is when one of the boys gets stuck I pick up a controller and jump in to help and when my work is done I drop out. They get my help and they still get to play. Another plus for the game is when a player dies they break into lots of lego pieces. No blood or guts. If it helps...favorites in our house include Jak and the Ratchet & Clank series.
4,cool,This game is the best I took down one star because the people don`t talk. Still it`s great that they let you use the power of the force.2 player mode was better than using the force eyeybody gives me stuff just to play it.
5,Lego Star Wars is the best,"This game is great. It is really fun and playable. You can change characters and meet aliens, and switch with them to get to another level.Buy it - you won't regret it."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it!","This game was fun and the graphics are great, but game play fun is limited. In about 12 hours of playing, I had unlocked every bonus item. While you may get a few days of enjoyment from this game, it's definitely now worth buying."
5,One of the coolest video games!,"I rented this Video game and it's awsome! There're lots of characters. And if you get all the canisters. You can unlockEpisode IV! and you can play as Darth Vader! And if you do nothing to him, you can here him breathing! you should get this game. It is super fun!"
1,Not compatible with older PS2 models????,"After having purchased this game as a birthday present for my son, we have found it does not work on our PS2 console. We are on our third game, and each had the same problem - disc read error - when we tried to load the game. I called Sony and they told me the problem was with the disc. However, the questions related to the age of my console and the COLOR of the disc. In the end they told me there was nothing that could be done. We would just have to get a FOURTH game to see if that would work. This seems exceptionally odd to me. All of our other games work perfectly fine, but then again, those games are not blue. If the product is that defective, then it should not be on the market. If it is not compatible with older consoles, then there should be a warning somewhere."
2,"Starts out fun, but gets frustrating","We just got this game today and could not wait to play it. My two sons and I have each had a few rounds with it. We all so wanted to love it, because we love the Star Wars movies. When you're first getting into it, it's a blast, tons of action and all kinds of extras. Then, you hit a brick wall (sometimes literally!) and cannot seem to keep advancing, no matter what you try. This frustrated us all to no end. The manual that came with the game offers very limited and generic help, it gets you started then you're on your own. I should point out that we aren't big time gamers, it's just something we do on the few days it's too cold to go out and the many, many days when it's too hot to go out. With this being a Lego game you would think it would be super easy and fun, but it's not. There were things we couldn't wait to try (like having a light saber duel with Darth Maul) but sadly we just never could get that far."
4,A big hit at our house,"At first we had trouble getting this disc to play but after doing some research, we did the ""scotchtape trick"" and we haven't had any problems since.Our kids LOVE this game - it's easy enough for our 4 year old and still exciting enough for our 10 year old. They like using the Force on objects and slapping silly moustaches on the Princess. They also enjoy changing characters in the Free Play mode.This game combines the excitement of Star Wars with the kid-friendliness of Legos and results in hours of good clean fun."
4,Excellent,"My five year old and my 12 year old, (along with thier dad) REALLY enjoy this game! There is fighting. However, unlike most games there is no blood spewing. The ""pieces"" fall apart! What a great idea for kids of ALL ages."
5,Bought this for my kids,"They played it for a while and then moved on to other games. They liked it while they had it - I thought it, like most video games was a waste of money. But the kids enjoy it still and play it everyone once in a while, even though they've beaten the game."
5,Lego Star Wars,You'll love this game. Because I hate Star Wars and I likethis. So dont wait and be bored by all the other games youhave. Hurry up and buy it before it goes out of stock.He he helol.
1,"the game is fun, but the gamecube version is better...","lego star wars is a pleasant surprise. don't be turned off by the kiddie lego graphics, because it's a great and entertaining game. the only reason i've given this a poor rating is because the gamecube version is a prettier and much better playing game than this one (and it's cheaper!)."
2,look great but don't fit,"when purchasing produce was told it would fit, come to find out it was for a extend cap 1995, Cost just as much to send back so I kept them"
5,Great seat for an older bike,"When I went searching for a seat for my '93 Electra Glide I learned just how difficult it is to find things for older scooters. My old seat was tired looking and very uncomfortable for all but the shortest trips.I decided on this seat based mostly on availability and looks, but I couldn't be happier with the comfort of the seat, either. It sits me down a little closer to the road, and back on the bike more a more comfortable ride. The material is a heavy leather-like vinyl. It has a good build quality, and looks like it will stand the test of time."
5,So Cute and useful.,"These are perfect for serving small amounts of dipping sauces, individual cheese or pickle portions, etc. They are great for portion control! I like the fact that these can separate those foods like juicy pickles. I have always been fussy about the juicy pickles contaminating other things on my plate. Now I can control them! I definately will purchase more of these as they are well made and very pretty."
5,Perfect hostess gift!,These are the perfect hostess gift to show that you care! Elegant and inexpensive - more thoughful than bringing a bottle of wine!
1,Unenlighted Filth,"This book is not only void of factual information, but the words within also contradict widely accepted psychology and sociology. This book is more of the passive advice of heteronormative mother who had a whim, than anything that resembles a helpful guide written by a parenting expert.This product is more than a skip."
1,Homophobic drivel,"Wow. I bought this book for 50 cents at the library thinking I might find some insight to help me with my toddler. Instead, I quickly saw that Jean Lush is a homophobic ""Christian"" looking to proselytize. Nothing on the front or back covers would indicate her insane views conveyed within. Now I don't want this book in my home, but I don't want to donate it so some other person sees it. I'm considering burning it...composting may be safer. Avoid this book!! I like the website Aha! Parenting for advice."
2,This book is WHACK!,Ms. Lush's views on Homosexuality and why men become gay are simply WHACK!I am a Christian and I do not believe in Homosexuality.I do not condem folks for being Gay or Lesbian and I accept people for who they are. You are who you are but this womansviews on how a mother's relationship with her son can cause amale child to become Gay is CRAZY!! I would recommend anotherbook - SERIOUSLY!
1,WANT SENSIBLE ADVICE ON RAISING A SON? DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"As a single mother of two sons, I was fooled by the title and appearance of the book. I thought it was written by credible authors with their views founded in reality and fact. Instead, this ""spiritual,"" ""Christian,"" ""family-oriented"" book does little more than spout drivel about how you--yes YOU--can cause your sons to be gay if you aren't careful. Stuff and nonsense!"
4,Scholarly list of Black leaders,"Well written, if dry recitation of the facts of Black political and movement leaders. A very good scholarly research resouce."
4,An enjoyable historical romance,"The book is a historical romance set in the early 1800's. The historical side of the story is well-developed, and the problems in the story come from the events happening at the time.The characters are well developed and act in realistic ways. The pacing is good. There is a fun ""Pride and Prejudice"" type proposal scene near the middle of the story. There are no explicit sex scenes.Genre Reviews[.........]"
2,Coulda been an EP,"This shouldn't have been released separately from Pt. 1, and just as a maxi-single."
2,Good music. Awful vocals & lyrics.,It is clear that these guys are a group of talented musicians. Their instrumentation is rich and beautiful and this is showcased best on Futuro [Live] and the beginning of Sun [Live]. It's a shame that they have to start singing because it all falls apart when they do and becomes so sugary awful and pedestrian that it is difficult to bear. The lead singers vocal quality is straining and nasal. The lyrics reveal a lack of any real poetic maturity which would be forgivable is the singing wasn't so bad. Perhaps they will grow into a good band or fade into obscurity.
3,"Great songs, short cd.","I was very pleased and very devastaded with this album at the same time for two very simple reasons: #1 they released this album too early for a b-sides album so it turned out short and #2 they put suspension (which was to be on ""the everglow"") on here. What they have on here is amazing but its whats lacking that i have a problem with."
5,JAN MICHAEL VINCENT - YUM,"THE TV VERSION DOES NOT SHOW THE NUDE SWIMMING SCENES WITH BUSTER & BILLY, SO THE UNCUT VHS VERSION IS A MUST HAVE."
4,A Haunting Tale,Jan Michael Vincent stars in this mondo-depressing tale of young love that meets a violent end. One of the best films produced during the mid-1970's...but don't watch it if you're hoping for inspiration.
2,How did a film with no script ever get made?,"There's barely any dialogue in this film, the script was downright awful. The only reason I saw this film was to see Jan Michael Vincent, who I feel has raw sex appeal. The story is cliched and the characters one-dimensional: it's the hackneyed story of the most popular guy in school falling for the class tramp with a heart of gold. The performances are its saving grace, as the actors are able to move the viewer. Rent the video first if you must see it but don't ever buy it or you'll end up regretting it."
5,classic for sure,"I was 10 when I first seen ""Buster and Billie"". I just bought the movie on ""DVD"" 2005, The quality is not so great, but that is ok for me because this is a hard to find ""DVD"". If you seen this movie years ago or never seen it before, I think you will like this movie. This movie is a 5 star all the way."
1,Clinique eye liner,"I never received this item. It was out of stock. I never received a refund for the order. I am out $14.00 for this product and would like to know when I will receive my refund. The seller told me it is Amazon's responsibility to refund it, yet I have no idea how to get in touch with Amazon.com to go about getting my money refunded.I am an avid purchaser on Amazon.com and this particular issue has been a very unpleasant experience."
5,"Very encouraging, and uplifting","I love the book, I read it daily. It helps me to keep things in perspective and keeps me centered when obstacles arise that I can identify with, with regard to a reading I read in the book. I love Iyanla!"
1,Acts of Faith: Daily Meditations for People of Color,The condition of the book is poor and should not have been sold. It has water damage.
5,An ESSENTIAL day tyo day masterpiece!,I absolutely love this book! I bought my first copy over 10 years ago and has given out at least as many as 10 as gifts to VERY appreciative people!
5,Quintessential Iyanla,"I had read several other books by Iyanla before I started with this one and I have to say that I have never read another book that give's one so much information and yet is so accessible. Iyanla has a way of making seemingly esoteric issues very relatable and very understandable, and very easy to apply to your everyday life. ""Acts of Faith"" is definitley in that vein. I would also recommend 'Until Today' by Iyanla which I believe is a more developed version of 'Acts of Faith' in that the daily passages are longer and she give daily affirmations and activities to complete on each day."
5,A MUST-HAVE FOR YOUR PERSONAL LIBRARY!,This book is truly inspirational! You'll want to keep this one with you at all times. I especially love the November 24th meditation. You're supposed to read one meditation per day but I just couldn't put the book down! I finished it in a few hours. I have since purchased three more of Ms. Vanzant's books and they're all winners.
2,Did you send it?,"I purchased from this seller b/c they had good reviews. I never received confirmation of purchase or mailing of book. I purchased for friend serving in Afganistan, I had no idea if it was sent. I had to contact seller to see what the status was. Apparently it was sent the next day... but how did I know? Confirmation would of been nice."
5,Excellant,"I am not a lady of color and I love this book. This book is for everyone. I keep my copy at work and start my day with it. One of the best things is you can keep reading it forever, or go to a section that will uplift you when you need it. I really enjoy my copy and thank her for writing it. I am glad the title didn't stop me from buying it."
5,A book that speaks to your heart.,"Few books I've read speak to the heart of healing like Acts of Faith. Each page contains essential truths that help in even the hardest circumstances. If you like this book, I also recommend the book ""Peace Be Still: Inner Healing for Racial Harmony,"" also available on Amazon.com."
2,Lousy fit and function,"The case is extremely tight over the lid portion of the phone, and somewhat loose over the body. As a result, the phone will not close completely and the part over the body tends to slide downwards when open. The hinge portion will probably loosen over time as the leather stretches. Although it has a cutaway at the hinge section for the camera lens, the view is still partly obscured when the phone is open unless you hold the case down with your finger (while trying to keep your finger out of view). The case can be unbuttoned into two halves, but since the lower half is somewhat loose there's a chance of it coming off. The w300i has flush keypad buttons, and the plastic keypad cover makes it difficult to operate the recessed center nav button and power button. The belt clip is gigantic and the stud is not removeable/replaceable. It makes the phone about twice as thick."
3,Le falta muchas canciones,Este album no tiene ni una tercera parte de lo que la Formula V ha hecho. 'Busca un amor' talvez sea la mejor cancion de este grupo y no se encuentra en esta coleccion. Realmente es solo un 'gusto' de esta agrupacion. Trate de buscar algo mejor en la calle. Se quedara con muchas ganas de escuchar mas sobre este gran grupo.
4,"Handsome, light, functional!","I was looking for a temporary replacement for a fancy Omega that went back to Omega to be refurbished after fifteen years of daily use. I wanted a watch with an alarm and an easy to read analog face. After trying a $60 watch that was just too thick and ugly to wear, I bought this Seiko.I have been very pleased. The watch is super light and has a very readable face. The alarm function, which I use frequently, is simple to use, and the stop watch function is easy as well. It is a bit too expensive to be a ""temporay replacement,"" but I think now that, when the Omega comes back, it will go into my valuables box in the bureau and the Seiko will be ny daily watch."
4,Quality Seiko Timepiece,"I've had this watch for a few months now and it looks great, is very light, and provides accurate time. As others have noted, the alarm is of limited value due to the low volume when engaged. The stopwatch is a handy feature and it works well. The titanium finish is very durable. However, I am noticing some wear on the clasp which is due to some abrasion which typically occurs when the clasp is in contact with another surface. (e.g. typing on a keyboard). This area is not readily visible when wearing the watch and the finish color does not highlight the wear marks. Overall a very nice watch. Note: If you want to save some dollars, buy the SNA139 with the black face. It's the same watch which Amazon currently has for about half the price. A five star watch, four stars for the watch price differential."
1,St. Avakian's First Church of Mao,"Writings from the leader of the cult which is the Revolutionary Communist Party. Avakian says nothing new or particularly insightful, despite what his followers like to think."
5,Not just for toys,"Very good product. In fact this is my second time to order this product. Very easy to use. I use it with my Epson R250 Inkjet printer, and so far, I have no complaints. Actually, I don't use it on toys. I use it on all kinds of surfaces - mugs, plaster, plastic, wood, painted surfaces, metal surfaces - as long as it's smooth and glossy.I recommend this product to anyone who is into decals."
4,Great decals but size is too small,They are great decals but are only half the size of a normal piece of paper. I went thru them way too quickly because of that. They are good though don't get me wrong just too small. Ohh and you need to set them after printing with the setting solution or a good finishing spray cause being its inkjet if you get it wet you'll have runny decals.
2,Small sheets = high price,"""Decal refill pack for the 9198 Custom Decal System. Refill pack includes six clear 5.5"" X 8.5"" decal sheets."" Note that these are only 5.5"" long, not the typical 11"" sheet. There are only 6. If comparing to 8.5"" x 11"" sheets, there are really only 3 sheets here. That is a high price, when there are suppliers online that ship 20 8.5"" by 11"" plus shipping for $27."
4,Testors clear decal paper,"I used these sheets to print off a decal for an old Civil Defense helmet. I found the decals to be of adequate thinness to conform to the curves of the helmet. One coat of Krylon clear was enough to seal the decal without making it too thick, but three coats was definitely too much. The decal responded well to Testors decal setting solution, but I was still able to adjust the position after application. The transparent areas of my decal did not silver.My one recommendation would be to print using your printer's high-quality setting instead of Normal as the instructions recommend. The evenness of the ink and accuracy and richness of color will be tremendously improved."
1,Won't Stick,"This product produced a clear and crisp decal using my DeskJet Printer, but it would not stick without lifting around the corners. Ultimately, I had to use Aleene's Tacky Glue (sold at craft stores) to glue the decal down. Under the circumstances, I could have just as well printed the decal on paper and glued it down. I use the decals to make signs for HO model railroad buildings. I can't imagine using this product for military models."
1,Only usable on light colored models,"I purchased this product to apply decals to a custom aircraft carrier model I am working on with a medium-colored gray as the primary color on it. It was easy to print onto the decals. However, because the decals are clear and not on white backing, they become completely transparent when moved off the decal backing. The white backing acts as a ""backlight"" for the decals, so as a result, the decals looks more like stains or shadows. I assume if you place these on a white or light-colored surface, they look ""better"", but they are completely unsable from why I need them.Also, the setting spray you have to spray them with to get them not to blur did not work very evenly, so some did smudge, some didn't. It seems the larger the block of the color the more likey the ink is to smudge."
1,Dissatisfied,Very brittle. Not the best quality transfer paper. Customer support is a joke. A form email is all you get when you complain.
5,favourite recordings last in your mind,"Everyone has a favourite recording and this is my Christmas favourite. I worked with this team of ringers and know the hours they dedicated and the love of their craft which grew over their years together. They are seniors in a secondary school, have performed with the BBC symphony Orchestra and won acclaim at the National Handbell Rally in York England; they have toured the US three times both entertaining and educating their audiences. I highly recommend the recording. Exaimine its contents and you will remember the melodies from your youth and from the collection of Christmas music fondly stored in your mind and heart."
5,Eyewitness does it again!,"We used this guide in March and found it most helpful in determining which places we'd like to see and what to do in the three days there. The Around the Region section is perfect for those of you who plan to be in Vegas 4-5 days or longer. From festivals, spas, outdoor activities, buffets to the grandest resorts...everything is covered with great photos for visually-based decisions. I would recommend this for all first time Vegas visitors."
2,outdated,It was a good book with a great list of top 10 things but the problem is that the times and stuff in the book are way outdated. Don't use this book to go by the times that the hotels do their performaces. It does help to rate places well but I was pretty disappointed in the information. I would suggest you get the 2006 guide to vegas because it is a lot more helpful.
5,VERY useful,"We forgot to bring it along on the trip, but still utilized it for many searches and planning before the trip. we will definitely bring it with on out next Vegas experience!"
3,Not exactly like picture- but still cute,The band at the top is not as wide as the picture shows- it is also a sheer lacey pink- you can't tell from the picture- but you can tell from description. Band is still cute and stays up well- I just would have loved if they were as wide as the picture. My main complaint is how big the fishnet holes are- your toes immediately poke out- kinda feels weird in between your toes- and doesn't look cute without shoes. but overall still cute.
3,"Looks nice, but short wire and chain","The lamp looks nice, and seems well made, however I have one significant complaint. The wire and chain the lamp hangs from are both only 24"" long on the one I received. Usually this type of light comes with 4-6 feet of wire and chain so that you can cut to fit for your application. If you plan to swag it, or if your ceilings are more than 9 feet, you'll need to buy new chain and wire and re-wire it."
3,dissapointing,"i bought this purely on suggestion from amazon. i dig the vibe, but the tunes are way too repetitive and the lyrics are pretty weak. Even though the tone sounds mature, I'd say the craftsmanship feels juvenile."
1,Crimson Code,"Rachel Lee has always been one of my favorite Authors. However, this book should no way be described as romantic fiction. There is absolutely no romance in it. This book could only be described as boring. She needs to return to the way she used to write, or not have her books sold as romantic suspence."
3,disappointing,"Luckily it's a very fast read as there are large sections of each page that you can skip to get the idea of what's going on.I hate books that are written to be in a series as the author is always trying to forshadow events for the next book, instead of just telling a good story and letting it go.I doubt that I care enough about the characters to follow them on another adventure."
1,"""THE STICHES"" big fan","WOW! I really like these guys. I found out about them on a skate video and wanted to get some of there music ever since. So I ordered it with a few other things and I got those ""other things"" within 2 weeks. It has been over a month and I am still waiting for the cd. I have never had this much trouble with Amazon. When you go to order the cd it even says ""ships within 7-12 days"". Guess I have to find somewhere else to get this."
3,Not bad for the price!,"It doesn't stay more than couple of hours. It looks the same smell but with lower quality. Don""t pay more than $15"
1,was unable to receive,i was unable to receive this product at my home address and was unable to put my po box number for it
1,movies that won't play,This movie was probably O.K.but it wouldn't play on my player because it was for region 2.I'm in region 1.
4,FIESTA LATINA,"Este disco contiene varios clasicos en español como lo son latin lingo de cypress, tres delincuentes, cerdos etc.Es una buena copilacion del hip hop en diversos lugares de latinoamerica. Para todos los que les guste los sonidos de rock y hip hop latino este es un disco que no puede faltar."
5,Great for kids with autism!,"I bought this for my 2 sons with autism and it is awesome! It took us awhile to hang it up in our house, but once we figured it out, it has been non stop fun! It gives our sons the sensory input they need to calm them. They giggle and interact with their other siblings. It also calms them to go to sleep at night. My one son whom is almost non verbal, calls out to his baby brother to come and push him. It is in constant use with them and my other children. I highly recommend this product!Completely worth the cost! Highly durable!"
4,Great quality but not enough support,"I decided to try this for my daughter who is non-mobile. Unfortunately, she falls to the side in it and it's not big enough to put her inside of it with a special seat. Luckily my son is able to use it -- he has severe ADHD so this helps keep him occupied! The one thing I don't like about it is with the pillow attached (it's held on with velcro) it makes the whole backside flip forward, which then gets in the way a little when initially getting in the swing. I'm sure the older and bigger the child is, the less of an issue this would be. Easy to hang, although you need to get a few extra (inexpensive) parts. Quality is great, although a little bummed to see this German product is made in China."
2,"Once more, the ball is dropped...","This is actually a very nice book for the beginning Reconstructionist Hellene: It details some of what is known of the major festivals, but it falls back upon a wearying, disheartening tendency found in the neo-Pagan movement. What is this tendency? It's the ""oh, crap -- researching how this stuff was ACTUALLY done is difficult"" realization, followed by pages of cookbook-style ""ritual"" almost wholly created in the mind of the author (as opposed to the ways our ancestors would have done the rituals) and presented to the reader as though the reader had just lately learned how to read. Disappointed, again!"
2,Nothing New,"The author proclaims this book to be a manual for reconstructionists everywhere. I bought the book, being very excited by the prospect, only to discover it to be a simplified, watered-down version of any book on ancient Greek religion. I think it's great that a practicing reconstructionist has written a book, but the contents don't tell the reader how one can fit this practice into a modern person's daily life. It's basically a summary of myths, heroes, and Gods. It's nothing new to the well-read recon."
2,Misunderstands,"Having read sections of the book, all I can say is that I am not impressed.There seems to be this guide message within his work, of misunderstanding and inproper research.He lists ""Romuva"" (which is Baltic - i.e. Lithuanian) as a Slavic Tradition. If Mr. Campbell cannot be bothered to do proper research into the area of Reconstructionism, he should stop and let others take a stab at it."
5,Ozarks MO Missouri Foxfire Book,"""A cultural journalism effort in the Foxfire tradition. A collection of articles reprinted from Bittersweet, a quarterly student publication (1973-1983) from Lebanon, Missouri High School. The book's goals are 'to record the life style prevalent in the Ozarks in the early 1900s and to portray characteristics of the land that influenced that lifestyle ... The voices presented in the transcribed interviews are clear & authentic."""
5,GREAT MUSIC!,"This movie is full good old fashion fun, excitement, and adventure. Well this isn't really that much different then all the other Roy Rogers films I've seen. I like how he seemed to almost always be to smart for most of the bad guys. Plus, his yodeling was also awesome to hear."
4,RR:Wall Street Cowboy,"I enjoyed this movie and am sure that everyone else that likes Roy Rogers as much as I do. This is a must-have for all fans. I, Ella Lumley purchased this dvd from Amazon.com., very reasonable and fast."
1,This sucks.,"Very horrible music and a terrible singer. It's all the cliches of your typical ""Goth Industrial Rock band."" I won't even go into the lyrics."
2,SHIPPED THE WRONG PRODUCT,"I WENT TO A LOCAL STORE AND PURCHASED A SUPER TURBO, WASNT AS LOUD AS I WANTED ...GOOD PERFORMANCE ON A BUDGET THOUGH."
5,Don't change rear disc brakes with out this,"Did not know about this until after I started by brake job. With any japanese car with rear disc brakes, this work much better than the 'cube' type tool to rotate rear calipers back. With the cube type tool, there is no leverage to push on. This set has multiple size plates to work with my 4 cars."
3,"Good Set, But Doesn't Fit 2005 Volvo S40i","Overall, this is a good set however I wished I was able to purchase the bigger set--wouldn't ship to Hawaii. Great for compressing the caliper pistons for the front brakes, but this set doesn't fit the 2005 Volvo S40i. I was able to jury-rig the closest one with a little tightening and twist at a time."
1,Skip It,"First of all, I enjoy watching movies of ALL types. I have had Netflix for about 4 years or so and love the Independent Film Channel and Sundance Channel. Zerophilia may have an interesting premise but it fails as both a comedy and a drama. At times it is confusing, but above all else... just plain dumb. There is much better out there. Go look for it."
5,Zerophilia,This movie was an enjoyable and interesting look at the fluidity of gender and sexuality. The actors were wonderful and well cast. The move itself starts a bit slow but the ending is worth the wait.
4,The best fighter for Sega's short lived Genesis add-on,"Sega's other failed Genesis add-on (the Sega CD outlasted it), the 32X didn't have much in terms of third party support (other than Acclaim, who also published this), let alone solid fighters. Besides a port of Sega's own Virtua Fighter, this port of Mortal Kombat II is the best fighter ever made for the 32X. Compared to the Genesis version, the picture has been cleaned up, the characters are larger, and the sound is noticibly better as well. All that being said, this ended up being the best installment in the 2-D Mortal Kombat series, but be forewarned that this is not an arcade perfect port. The Sega Saturn version of the game, released only a few years later, is an arcade perfect port that took advantage of the Saturn's 2-D processing power. That being said, if you still own a 32X and want the best games available for it (and believe me, there are few), Mortal Kombat II is the best fighting game you'll find for it."
1,Don't buy a Hitachi TV!,"I'm an owner of a Hitachi TV that I purchased last year (though not this model). It's on its second trip to the repair shop. This time its been in there for 7 weeks. I keep getting the runaround from the repair center Hitachi had take the TV and Hitachi says their isn't much they can do for me except wait for it to be repaired. If you value your TV-watching experience, stay away from Hitachi. If you ever have problems with your set and need it repaired, plan to wait for months. I'd give this zero stars if Amazon would let you."
1,dont buy,save time money and headache dont buy....... if something goes wrong they dont make the part ........ espesially if the screen comes on then goes off .....blinking 3 times blue
2,Beware Screen Burn !,"I purchased this exact model in August 2007 from Amazon. Now, in April 2008 there is plenty of screen burn such as the CNBC logo and the HIstory Channel logo. I called Hitachi to check the warranty and screen burn is not covered under warranty. Hitachi just said sorry, you have to live with it or buy another one. I will NEVER buy a Hitachi again. Another huge complaint is the remote. The button layout sucks and the remote has to be pointed exactly at the remote sensor on the tv or it doesn't work even with fresh batteries. Also, when you change the channels there is a huge delay (a black screen)before the next channel appears. If your a channel surfer you will be in a nightmare. DO NOT BUY THIS PLASMA TV !"
2,Fantasy?,"This is a mystery with a twist. Whether it should be considered fiction or fantasy depends partly on whether you believe in psychics but also on the twist, which has, to my knowledge, no precedent in human history and is inclined to make you vomit. It is not hard to figure out in advance if you read carefully. The story probably owes some credit to the late John Wayne Gacy. There is suspense in abundance, and it is well handled if predictable, though one event seems wrong, but then a Giant Rampaging Inconsistency bashes in the front door and invalidates the story."
4,Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. In fact I read it in about 6 hours the day it came out. This is not the type of thing I normally read, being a SF and fantasy fan myself, but I love Holly Lisle other titles and thought I'd give this a go. It was brilliant.It's filled with memorable characters and has a great twisty ending. The level of paranormal involvement is just enough to keep you hooked without dropping you into any 'hey, wait a minute' moments. I loved the tension that runs through this book, both the normal, 'got to catch the killer' kind with some delicious sexual tension added into the mix.I've ordered myself a copy of Holly's previous paranormal suspense novel Midnight Rain and if this is anything to go by it should be a great read."
2,Not so great,"I've read Lisle's ""I see you"" and ""Midnight Rain"", and both are better than this book. This book's characters were really dull (Hank felt like he just existed in a bubble to do his psychic thing when needed, and have sex with Jess whenever possible) and there was very little tension, conflict or action in the plot. I began to get bored by about page 100, but suffered through the rest of the book because one of Lisle's other books was a bit slow for a bit, but then got MUCH better. This one, unfortunately, never improved. The final conflict was over much too quickly. This book is very forgettable. I'm glad I didn't spend too much on it."
1,Too many plot holes,"Sorry. Too many plot holes and not enough character development.I actually liked the premise and the characters, but stopped reading about 2/3 way through when something was bad enough to make him violently ill and he left her, but then blithely met back up with her at her apartment to continue sleuthing."
2,Your Money's Better Spent Somewhere Else,"This album is fine -- decently produced and conceived -- but it is a bit hackneyed. It grooves, but the sampled sounds aren't particularly fresh and the production is fairly stale. If you really want to hear innovative fusion of trad Brazilian and Electronica, try Suba's ""San Paolo Confessions"" or Amon Tobin's ""Supermodified."""
3,Okay... but there definitely are better,"I picked this up when it came out a few years ago and never really got into this. I first heard Zuco 103 on the compilation ""Brasil 2Mil"" by sixdegreesrecords and liked Outro Lado, but Zuco's feature release didn't impress me much at all. There were a few catchy songs, and the Outro Lado mix on this cd was pretty cool. But otherwise the sound effects and most of the rest of the tracks seemed too gimmicky and ""silly"" even. You may enjoy this album at first, but I ended up shelving it and haven't listened to it much since.I agree with the previous reviewer - there are better albums out there. I'd pick up Brasil 2Mil instead and enjoy the Zuco track there and hear some of the different/diverse sounds. Suba's Sao Paulo Confessions is phenomenal for a ""new"" sound. I also would recommend Bebel Gilberto's Tanto Tempo (original)."
5,HIP GROOVES TO SOOTHE YOUR EVERY MOOD,"This CD has made my summer a groovy one. This trio melds together influences from diverse corners of the musicworld: brazilian ,obviously, jazz, drum and bass, funk, MPB, but it all seems to come together quite naturally and manages to sound fresh and hip. The lyrics are great too (and all translated into English). Lilian Vieira combines a spicy voice that can be soft or with more treble depending on the mood she's in with catchy melodies and great grooves that the drummer and keyboardist-programmer put down. A definite must for anyone who's into the more contemporary, groovy brazilian stuff, with a unexpected Euro-edge!"
3,Just wants to sell software,"Decoz seems more interested in selling his software that in teaching numerology. Worksheets would aid the student and give them a good grounding in the theory, so that when (and if) they go to software, they will be able to confirm the validity of the reports."
1,Missing pages,The material in the book is great--so I'm even more disappointed to see that pages 211-242 are missing and pages 243-272 are printed twice. How do I make a complaint?
3,Non Fiction,"Numerology : Key to Your Inner Self by Hans Decoz is one of those whacky things where letters in the alphabet are assigned numbers, and you keep adding them up in a shrinking fashion to determine if you, your dog, or your parrot, are a 3 or an 8 or even a lucky 7. This is an entertaining enough pasttime for a little bit."
5,Numbers Everywhere,This book is a must for anyone wanting to do numerology. Keep it in your library for reference.
4,Good Talent,These guys have an excellent feel for the music. They can don't discriminate themselves to just rap but branching off into reggae and even a little r&b. You can bang you head to some of the songs or just chill out and listen to some different knowledge. Buy this CD.
1,Too many carbs!,"I cannot understand how anyone with diabetes or a carbohydrate intolerance of any kind could eat any of these items. They are so high in carbohydrates. I follow a low-carbohydrate regimen for health reasons (not vanity), and I could safely eat none of the recipes found in this tome. I returned the book"
2,Too much sugar and carbs,I was disappointed with the recipes. I was expecting recipes that used splenda and other products to have very reduced carbohydrates in the desserts. These looked like regular recipes to me.
5,PEDRO FERNANDEZ ES FANTASTICO.,"PEDRO TIENE UNA VOZ TAN LINDA Y BELLA. RECOMIENDO ESTE CD PORQUE TIENE UNAS CANCIONES BIEN LINDAS, Y SU MARIACHI ES FANTASTICO, LO MEJOR DE MEXICO. CON MUCHO AMOR......................................................"
5,Pretty nifty,"I have similar bags, but couldn't find it anywhere until now. Really comes in handy, helps with organizing small items."
4,What is there really to say?,"They are good quality bags for whatever it is you need a bag like this for. Whip out a ruler and see if these are the sizes you would want. Of course I am not sure if the zipper will withstand the test of time as many do not, but that can be said for most non-heavy duty/military grade zippers. I plan on purchasing another set later once I hear what these have to say once they have been given time to tell on themselves."
4,Pretty robust little bags,"These bags are heavier canvas material and should stand up to quite a bit of abuse. Only slight drawback I have so far is that when opened the zipper pull is on the ""hook"" side and they tend to scrunch together, you'll grab the hook when going for the zipper and vice versa. These apparently must also be sold in retail environments since it took two hours to cut the zip tie, get the two industrial staples out, cut the external plastic tie and then cut the internal plastic tie. OK it only took a few minutes but it is a bother and the staples leave holes in the bags. Still a decent product when all is said and done."
4,Great durable bags,I bought these for my knick-knacks to be held within my Pelican case. I'm a filmmaker and have a lot of smaller objects like SD cards that would be disastrous if I lost them. These bags help me organize everything very neatly.My only complaint is that the plastic clips are not removable. I really wish that they were because they tend to snag and take up unnecessary room in my case.
5,"G.S Mountain View, CA",Costum Leathercraft 1100 Multi-Purpose Clip-on Zippered poly BagsPerfect size for tools. Quality is really good!! I highly recommend this product! Thanks
4,Good tool pouches,The clip on the bag is useful for tethering it within my larger tool bags so I don't take the pouch(es) out and leave them somewhere by accident. They are quite durable.
4,great for small parts,"I hang two of these full of small hardware from my Bucket Boss Brand 06065 Pro GateMouth Jr. Perfect for screws and other smaller items that would otherwise get lost in drawers, toolboxes, etc. I prefer this option to plastic boxes though the narrower opening (compared to a box) isn't quite as convenient when what you need is down in a corner."
3,"heavy material, but","In reading reviews several people mentioned that the sizing on theses are strange. Something I could not understand until I got them, I have a book of data thats important, looked like it might fit, no. I am sure, I am going to end up using these in my emergency box, the med, for xtra batterys, the small for bandaids and probably use the large for scissors and the like. Not my original purpose, but for the price ok. It is almost like some one tried to make then odd, maybe a designer who had not got a raise. Will give even odd comments on reviews more credit in future"
3,nice,Overall the bags are perfect for storuing small misc items such as air hose nozzles and drill / driver bits etc . The clips were a little small. They were not as sturdy as hoped and are more difficult to use with gloves than the caribiner type clips.
3,Very Awkward Sizes...,"To be honest, I'm having a hard time finding a use for these due to the awkward sizing. It seems like they're consistently just a little bit too short for my uses. The quality is top notch... but the sizing just doesn't work for me."
4,Pure Tranquility,"This deeply relaxing album is the third release by Shajan and has quickly turned into one of my favorites this year! The tranquil sounds of the ocean, whales and dolphins intertwine with the serene soundscapes created by Shajan will help bring peace to any restless mind. This album is a perfect choice for relaxing after a long day or for starting your day in a relaxed state of mind. I would also reccomend:Music for Reiki & MeditationorPerfect Balance: Musical Healing, Vol. 2"
5,My Top Favorite Reiki Music,"My Reiki clients rave about this CD that I often use during Reiki sessions. In fact, they often request it for subsequent sessions and/or want to know how and where to get a copy for themselves. My oldest daughter in particular loves the water and whale sounds. I cannot remember if I reviewed this after my first purchase of it. This, however, is my second purchse as a birthday gift for said daughter. It is the one in my Reiki music collection that I most often use for self-healing. You will especially like it if water is your element."
1,Disappointed,"I checked this book out from the library after reading mostly positive reviews. I can generally find some pretty good books this way. However, I was very disappointed after reading this book. I just found it to be a bad story, I felt like the text didn't flow well as I read it aloud to my 3 year old son. As a former school librarian I have read a lot of children's books, and this is not one I would have added to my collection nor read aloud to a class."
5,How I wish there were more Wild Boar books!,"Wild boars, rude, smelly, giving you fleas? How can it get much better than this! My 3 year old asks for this and her ""Massive Pudding"" (the other boar book) constantly and we are reserving at the library on a regular basis. I have taken them in to read to her preschool as well and they love it, the teachers love it, and frankly after at least 5 zillion readings of it I still love it. It is creative, great illustrations and when my daughter is being rude, smelly, etc, it is a light way to correct the behavior by asking if she is Morris, Boris, Horace or Doris. I strongly recommend this book. If you can't laugh at farts you probably should pass but if you can't, you should really try to learn! I only wish there were more ""wild boar books"" out there."
1,A Horrid Little Book With No Redeeming Social Value,"I completely concur with the previous author. This book is horribly crass and terribly unfunny.Unless you want to explain to your child what the steaming pile of feces is on the last page, I'd recommend against reading this one to them."
1,Crude & Rude with NO Redeeming Value,"Despite the cute illustrations this book is about crude, rude boars (or boors). While an adult may (or may not) think this is sarcasm, for sure kids won't ""get it!"" This is a lousy example to set before kids of any age. The kids will love the poop pictures and farts and general bad behavior, but most parents (and especially grandparents) will be VERY put off by this book. I wish I had my money back. I did NOT give the book to the child it was bought for. I threw it away instead."
5,Works as advertised,Works perfect. I have mine connected to the masterlink (SRAM Powerlink). No problems. What is there else to say? It works.
4,Great romantic adventure!,"This is a great romantic adventure story in an exotic setting. The hero is genuinely heroic, the heroine refreshingly and endearingly capable. A highly entertaining read!"
4,"Lively melodies, infectious fun","If ""early"" or ""renaissance"" music appeals to you, Praetorius' Dances from Terpsichore should be a keystone of your collection. The melodies are lively, the gaiety is palpable. The performances on this disc are indeed spirited, with a nice balance between foot-pounding numbers and more stately melodies. Some selections include vocals (mainly in old French), which are entrancing. Even if this period of music isn't quite your favorite, this super-cheap disc definitely is worth a try; you may even change your tastes as a result of hearing it. By the way, Mr. Hurwitz' review has one error: the main performers are Swedish, not Dutch, and they are joined by a Swiss group on several tracks."
3,Good for beginner,"Purchased for my kids to play with. They enjoyed it, anytime you can ""jam"", even with the video it is helpful.. I think that it may have helped their timing and confidence."
3,Ok but not great,"I thought the dvd was ok, but for a fiddler like myself it really didnt teach me much of anything. I would like to have seen more detail for playing back up with a fiddle."
2,"Too easy, or I am further than I thought...;D","This dvd was highly recommended to me, so my expectations were rather high. But it is too easy. I may have underrated my own level and that is a good thing, I guess... It's pretty boring also. The same songs go on for 10 minutes or even longer. I'm going to find a beginning banjo player who may have more to gain from it.If I understand it correctly, the next dvd up is a LOT more difficult so I'll have to find something else to jam to. (Jam with? On? For? Dunno, not my language.)"
1,Whispering?,"I sat in astonishment throughout the viewing of this DVD. It reminded me of cowboys in the late 1800s breaking wild mustangs. I have been involved with dogs for 25 years, am a student of dog psychology and have observed many different trainers and their techniques over the years. What I saw was a man putting dogs under incredible amounts of stress to the point where they had to give up fighting for their lives. His customers who were awed as his results must not be aware of such professionals as Victoria Stilwell or Martin Ruetter in the German-speaking countries. I prefer working WITH my dogs and having them enjoy working with me. Pinning a dog to the ground with a death grip and taking being bitten for granted only demonstrated to me how primitive his methods are. Sad."
1,Possibilities squandered by weak preaching,"A story I tried very hard to like. Great beginning and superb crafting of a believable last days environment. Unfortunately the writer has to make all people with religeous faith out as morons and unthinking zombies. Of course, the heroes of the tail are agnostic and never leave a chance to show their superior understanding. This hang up flattens the story to 1 dimension and continues to weaken it so that by the end, what should have been a great book, was preaching and as such was unsavory. Funny how one who obviously has a disdain for religion would be so willing to shallow her own work by acting like the characters she depicts as religious in her book rigid and without ability to see and understand others."
1,The world ended and it's all the Christian's fault.,That is this book in a nutshell. The Christian characters are all unfailingly and unrelentingly wild eyed lunatics who nearly destroy attempts at recovery after the End. The only hope for humanity lies with our agnostic heros who work to plant a seed for a future rebirth of civilization. I'm glad I borrowed this one from the library instead of buying it.
5,Great product,Both other reviewers didn't rate the product. They rated amazon's service. The product is great for it's price. It's can be hooked up with it's built in fm transmitter or directly with it's headphone jack (which does not include the wire and requires you to have an aux in for your vehicle). Both work well and the sound is crystal clear. The missing features are easy indoor hookup (no compatible boom box) and lack of rewind/fast forward but neither are needed for car only use.
3,Wires or Not?,"The Amazon Product Review for theis radio states both that ""you'll have to connect it to your stereo console via wires"" and that it ""includes a built-in FM transmitter that sends Sirius radio programming to your vehicle's FM tuner, so you don't have to make a direct connection"". Which is it?"
1,NOT FERTILITY!!,"I have been studying Egyptology for over a year now and actually know a bit of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs...the ankh has NOTHING to do with fertility! Ankh simply means ""life."""
1,Buyer Beware - Rating is for BZTRENDS,"I will not use BZTRENDS again. They have not replied to my emails. The Onkyo SKS-HT240 speaker set is an attractive set with excellent sound quality. Be sure to see dimensions, as they are larger than what appears in the images. Unfortunately, the Sub-Woofer stopped working less than a year after I purchased the product. ONKYO states that speakers have a 2 year warranty, only if the item was purchased from an authorized dealer. I live in Louisiana and the nearest authorized service center is in Michigan. After sending the product, they told me that the unit is NOT covered under warranty, since BZTRENDS is NOT an authorized dealer of ONKYO. I noticed on another review that the sub-woofer stopped working, but the vendor replaced it. I am still awaiting a reply from BZTRENDS, but I would recommend purchasing this product ONLY from an authorized dealer, if you want the manufacturer's warranty."
4,Surround System,"Speaker system is pretty good, but the speakers are actually much bigger than the picture would lead you to believe. Overall, sound is good and the sub is really pretty good. Nice buy for the price."
5,Awesome Brush for Pomeranians!,"I bought it after reading a few forums where pom breeders/show owners raved about it. I love it and have used it for years. Aside from a bristle brush it is the only one I will use on my poms as it won't eat their coats (though it does remove dead hair).It is very narrow and the pins do not have the round balls on the end that have a tendency to tear out healthy coat. It makes for easier, gentler grooming (for both owner and dog), and your pom will keep more of his coat. While using this (or any brush--especially a pin brush), I recommend lightly misting the coat with a water bottle with a drop or two of doggie conditioner. It makes the grooming even more gentle and will help loosen smaller knots."
3,Kitchens & Baths,"Candice Olsen is a premier designer and I follow her work religiously. Unfortunately, this DVD was of previously aired shows. I should have read the description of the DVD better prior to ordering. Also, the material is dated several years back."
3,"Complete & Concise, but...","This book is a good companion to bring with you or to study prior to your trip to Germany. It covers all of Germany's regions with detailed descriptions of many of the sights. However, note that this book is written with youthful travelers in mind (i.e. students)with lots of references to clubs, inexpensive lodging and outdoor activities. I was disappointed to see NO PICTURES WHATSOEVER! Also, there is not a lot mentioned that would be of use to families with small children. Overall I would give the book 4 stars for it's up-to-date information, but only 3 for design and appeal to 30-somethings with kids."
3,Not a lot of -umph!,"I always prefer loose tea to bagged, it is like the difference between canned coffee and freshly ground. However, these leaves lacked flavor and made a very weak cup of tea. I was disappointed."
3,Non pressure compensating...,"Not a bad deal, just not pressure compensating. I didn't realize this was left out from the product description until I already had them. Will keep them , due to the unavailability of drip irrigation fittings in my area. I ran them for a while on a 25 GPH, pressure reduced supply line. 1/2"" tubing, 25' long. Irrigation rate was free flowing, no pressure adjustment whatsoever. Converted them all for pressure compensating."
2,Unbelievable!,"Altho' they're ""cuticle scissors"", I multi-task. Because of their size & ease of handling, they're perfect for any precision job on hair, eyebrows even removing hang tags in garments without fear of clipping material. Oh, and yes, they're great for cuticles too! Worth every penny!! Have used others...this investment is for a lifetime!"
5,"My fave cuticle scissors, and I've tried A LOT of them","Sharp. Comfy handles. Attractive. Durable. VERY thin blades. Nicely made.Since I discovered these some six or so years ago, I have a collection of unused cuticle scissors by other makers. Rubis blows them outta the water. Stay sharp for a long time before needed sharpening.My husband helps me with my pedicure, and these are the ONLY scissors he likes using on my feet. I use them to cut my fingernails,too, they're strong enough (though very thin and meant for cuticles).LMC is an authorized distributor of RUBIS, so it's safe to get from them.thumbs up"
1,Price is truly insane!,"Let's see you get 12 movies (which you didn't pick) for $284.95. That comes out to $23.66 each! You end up paying MORE for several of these movies so what's the point of bundling them together?!? Sets like these have to be way cheaper to justify the purchase.Anyone who gets this set for $284.95 should have his/her head examined! C'mon Amazon, give us better deals than this!"
1,And the price keeps going up!!!!!!!,"First it was $285, then $306. Now hold on to your hats. It is now $407!!! Amazon.....are you out of your mind? Prices of blue ray discs are slowly going down, but you offer a 12 pack with a very strange selection and you just raised the price of the pack $100?? Brilliant marketing strategy. And where did you come up with this assortment of movies? It doesn't make any sense. IF any person in America buys this idiotic 12 pack it would floor me."
1,Dear God Amazon,"Yeah so I just did a breakdown of the prices from Amazon and if you bought all of these separate from the site it would cost you 218.88, brand new. If you decided to buy new between Amazon and the marketplace for the best price you would be spending less than 182.00. Although I like almost all of the movies it clearly is nowhere close to a good value."
3,Lucky,"I guess I am the only lucky one who got a great deal on this box set. I paid $165.94 for this set in June 2008. I had seen all of the movies except for ""Layer Cake"" with Daniel Craig and I was pleasantly surprised by the story. I expected to get a B movie but what I got was a movie that held my interest throughout even though the ""good guy"" is really a bad guy. However, there is no way I would pay $285 for this set now."
3,Aliens-Panther Alien,"The Panther Alien was part of the original set of Alien figures released by Kenner. It would later be repainted as the Night Cougar Alien. The figure comes with a launching parasite that is released off its back, moving tail, and poseable legs. No comic book with this figure. Both the Panther and Night Cougar aliens do just about the same thing, the only real difference is their color. I think the colors on the Panther alien are plain TERRIBLE! Who did the paint job on this figure? It looks less scary and less like an alien! In my opinion, the Night Cougar alien is better looking than the Panther alien. Yet, both are hard to find figures.Recommended for collectors."
1,Don't bother,"Waste of money. Waste of time. Only advertising book i've been inspired by has been ""Hey Whipple Squeeze This."" Save your money and skip this one."
5,Tested Advertising Methods,This is a great book to get a broad education on everything that is needed to know for writing good advertisements. I highly recommend it to anyone needing that knowledge.
5,Your foundational grounding in advertising and copywriting.,"If you want a firm foundation in marketing and advertising, that you won't get in business school then this is the book for you.You will get dozens and dozens of clear, tested, actionable ideas and steps to improve the profitability of your marketing and advertising efforts.If you are not familiar with direct response methods, the book may be a little overwhelming at first, as it is a different perspective on advertising (that it should make profit) then you will typically experience.The book is also a great value compared to the multiple hundred or thousand dollar seminars on Internet marketing that are often just regurgitating direct response methods.Cheers!"
5,Learn How to Motivate People to BUY Your product!,"This book is the best book on marketing that I have ever seen! You know, I think this book provided with me the same stuff that would cost me 5000+ dollars to have some ""marketing guru"" to tell me the secrets of advertising. This book is literally a gold mine! I highly recommend this book to anyone who has to motivated people with this pen. Read it today!Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated"
2,Tested Advertising,This book is a MAJOR disappointment....I thought I was buying the 4th Edition as advised by many other writers and I can see why I should of.This book is boring and non inspirational in anyway or form. Claude Hopkins and Robert Collier run rings around this.
1,"""How To Use The Bathroom""","The above headline was seriously touted by the 5th edition of this book as an example of a *good* headline. No, I am not kidding. It's on page 59.John Caples himself would have said it was a crappy headline (no pun intended) because there's no news, it doesn't offer you anything you'd want, and it doesn't arouse your curiosity.The 5th edition of this book is ruined by all the garbage added by whoever ""revised"" it.The other reviewer who said to get the 4th edition is absolutely right. Bottom line: do not buy the 5th edition sold by Amazon. Instead look for a used bookseller offering the 4th edition or earlier. The book that was actually written by Caples is one of the most valuable marketing books, period."
3,"Fun, but not spectacular - until the final fight sequence!","So far, this is the last of the Jacke Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao trio films. This is also the only one of their films in which these three fight each other, which they do for about half the movie like a bunch of kung-fu three stooges.As Jackie Chan films go, this is not one of his all-time best. The fight scenes, although enjoyable, are not as spectacular as some of the other work he's done. But I do reccomend this picture on the basis of the terrific final fight sequence between Jackie and the man considered by many to be the greatest opponent Jacke has ever fought with, Benny ""The Jet"" Urqunidez."
5,A Triumphant reunion.,"Ever since Jackie Chan, Samo Hung, and Yuen Baio where in the Chinese Opera School together they had a wonderful friend/enemy relationship. This movie, wich is hopefully not their last movie together, was infact one of the best movies any of these talented people have starred in. One of the very many reasons to buy this movie is the reunion of old opera schoolmates wich makes for great slap-stick comedy and a touching story. This movie is THE BEST, hands down. Jackie Chan gives a 5 * performance, along with his big brother Samo Hung and his Little Brother, Yeun Baio. Thanks for reading my review and, if you buy this movie, congrats because you have just bought a piece of history that may (i hope) be repeated soon."
3,Ligthhearted movie probably forgotable,"If you are not very exigent with good plot an credible villains you can watch this. The best are the scenes with Chan, Hung and Biao together. The fight of Chan in the boat is good too and of course the final figth have some good moments. But the villains are cartonboard in despicted of the plot and the romance scenes doesn't add more dimension to the characters. Like others Chan movies this is basically a fun movie with some good action scenes. Perharps it can be a three and a half stars movie but if I have to decide between 3 or four I give 3, because the bad villains .If you can rented first do it and the decide, if not I can say Chan have worst pictures but buy it used. Good DVD extras if you are oriental, many trailers and you are not going to be disappointed with captions, you have English and then: Thai, Chinenese, Japanese, Korean and many others, 2 languages: chinese mandarin and cantonese."
3,Great for action only,"Dragons Forever has the action that will satisfy Chan fans, but the dialogue and romantic scenes, as well as the confusing plot, are awful. I realize that romance is not the backbone of Jackie Chan films, action is, and Chan, Sammo Hung and the rest of the cast are terrific."
3,MMMMMMMM...,"COMPRE ESTE FILME ESPERANDO MUCHO MAS DE ESTE TRIO ACTORAL, LA PELICULA ES ENTRETENIDA, PERO ES UNA MAS, NO SOBRESALE DEL RESTO DE LA SAGA DE LOS LLAMADOS ""TRES MOSQUETEROS"".PARA VER NO MAS DE 2 VECES."
5,THE BEST JACKIE CHAN MOVIE EVER!!!!,"When I first saw this movie, they were showing a Jackie Chan marathon for 2 nights and since Jackie Chan is my favorite action hero, I watched Wheels on Meals, Winners and Sinners, The Protector, Heart of Dragon and Young Master and then Dragons Forever showed and when I saw that I was glued to the TV nothing could get me away from it, the fights were incredible especially with Jackie Chan and Benny ""The Jet"" Urqudiez, and there was a lot of humor with Sammo Hung and Yien Biao. That will be the best Jackie Chan movie I have ever saw and I think guys who like a lot of action will enjoy this movie"
4,"Great Game, One Downfall- Overall Good Buy","As a frequent buyer, I know the DDR's quite well. Although Universe can definetely boast among the best ddr's, it has one shortcoming. The arrows for playing the game are smaller than the other games. If you think this might be a problem, do not buy. Otherwise, add it right to your cart."
4,Another Great DDR game!!!!,"DDR is a great game for exercise, parties, or just a good source of music =)The only problem with the ddr pad is if your not centered and you attempt to hit one of the buttons on the top or bottom edge, it won't trigger, so you have to center yourself every so often. But until they make a metal pad for the 360 what can you do?One other problem with the game: The 360 allows for custom sound tracks in some games, however the makers of DDR Universe have decided NOT to use that and therefor you cannot import your favorite song, or classic DDR song, and create a custom dance track for it =(Overall I would recommend this if you enjoyed other ddr games and have a 360 =)"
4,Black Finish Two Speed Desk Fan,"The fan works great so far and it matches things on my desk! I have a color coordination going on :) It's a little big for a small fan, but it still fits on my desk with no problems!"
1,Narrow-minded,"The ""arguments"" against suicide were so absurd, I had to search through the book to see if it was actually a parody or satire. The author lists reasons such as ""My husband could never find everything he needs to file the income taxes,"" ""Commiting suicide is like dropping in on God without an invitation,"" and ""Day care for my children is more expensive than therapy is for me."" Not at all recommended."
5,Perfect,These pants are the best fitting and most comfortable pants I have purchased in awhile! How can you beat this price!!! I would buy more if I could find other colors. Very nicely made too :)
1,"Very disappointing pants: great wool, terrible design","To me a ""basic wool flannel trouser"" would be a more classic fit. The very low waist (NOT waist), 4"" zipper, too-long, and very wide cuff was an awful disappointment. I own 3 pr. Harve Benard from 4-5 years ago which fit me beautifully - same good tailoring, lined wool - so that's what I expected. I am 5'7"" and this year's design drags on the floor and sits down on my hips. The pant legs are 4"" wider than my old ones. Also missing here are the side elastic options."
5,Healing the Wounds that Bind Us,"So many of us are damaged in childhood, many times carrying around unresolved baggage that keeps us stuck and unable to live our best lives. This delightful and insightful book helps us understand what has molded us into who we are, and then gives us the tools to move towards a more rewarding and fulfilling life. 'Healing the Sensitive Heart' compassionately takes us on a journey of a millions miles by encouraging us not to be afraid of taking the first step.Jacqueline Marcell, Author, Elder Rage"
5,Good advice.,"This book is an excellent read for those of us who continually make stupid relationship decisions. Why do I let myself fall for the same type of person over and over when I know it will only lead to emotional pain for me? This book tells us so much about the ways of getting into these kinds of patterns, how to recognize them, and then how to move on. Everyone should give this book a try, even if you think you've never had any problems."
2,WAY too expensive for an okay album,"Vancouver Nights has an interesting sound, but it really isn't music that would get caught in your head. I'd suggest trying to find this on itunes, rather than buying this album. WAY WAY WAY WAY to expensive."
4,"Tasty, but mild.","If you're used to the kick of standard Insanity or Total Insanity, then this will be quite disappointing from a heat perspective. Has a decent taste to it, kind of a garlic limey flavor, but not spicy in the least. Goes well with soups and salads I've found."
5,can't help but move you,"I put this on and here is what follows:I get nostalgic for the old songs, blue for the sad ones, happy from the peppy ones and feel such regret that this multi-talented man is gone so soon. It says in the liner notes that jazz was his first love. It comes through loud and clear in Sweet and Lowdown. (I sing along every time!)"
1,Why Dave Van Ronk became a folksinger,"At least listen to this before you buy it. Dave is backed up by something resembling the ""Guys' All-Star Shoe Band"" from PHC (Arnie Kinsella is on nearly every track) rather than backing himself up on the guitar. If you enjoy listening to standards like ""I can't get started"" sung by Frank Sinatra or Susanna McCorkle or even Willie Nelson, Dave's version may ruin that for you forever. Really, he just doesn't know how to sing this music."
5,Topped Only by the Original,"'Flashman in the Great Game' takes our man Flash to India just as the Great Mutiny (aka Sepoy Rebellion) was about to get under way in 1857. Flashman soon goes to ground to hide from the arch-fiend Ignatieff. The readers gets something of an insider's view of the rebellion, albeit through Harry Flashman's eyes. Harry finds himself in an unsual number of tight spots and even falls in love, well, as much as Harry can do.Fraser is really in top form here. I've read about half the Flashman books and this one is topped only by the original.Highest recommendation."
2,Whoa! Too Many Cooks!,"This film wants to be romance, mafia store, rap star showcase, and more. It's cluttered. Plus, almost every character is soooo angry and violent. As soon as two people are on the screen together, either they are going to come to blows or say all kinds of nasty words to each other.I usually give rubbish like this one star. However, I'll give this two due to the main character. The main character shows his butt twice and it's a prize winner! Talk about buns of steel. It was ebony, onyx, and chocolate all wrapped up in one. Since these films have a teenaged male target audience, I was very surprised to see some male nudity here."
1,I've returned two --the video output hasn't worked on either,"The first one I received, my cable man installer told me the video and audio output on the unit were defective. So I returned it, got a second one, and on the 2nd one, the audio worked fine, but the video output was defective. I am not trying for a 3rd time. If I decide a need a DVD player, I will spend the extra bucks to get a decent one. Don't waste your time and money on this product."
5,Good Product,"Based on the reviews here, I wasn't expecting much. I purchased this item on 8 June 2005 and have been waiting for it to crap out on me. My Sharp TV is dying out before this thing.I haven't had a chance to try out all the different formats but it plays DVDs and Music CDs just fine.I put this thing through hours of constant play and it's performed very well considering. When I say constant, I mean ""I left it on Repeat Play all night and all day long"" constant. Pretty good for the fifty bucks I paid for it.As I recall, I also got very fast delivery too from Crutchfield(?) Electronics. I'll certainly check out JVC in the future."
3,Ultimately an inferior reproduction of a great work.,"The world described throughout this and the other Obernewtyn chronicles bears more than a little resemblance to that imagined by John Wyndam in THE CHRYSALIDS. Whilst the Obernewtyn series is clearly aimed at a younger readership and expands in many ways upon the post apocalyptic theme originated by Wyndam, the earlier book in my opinion remains the better story. Carmody never delves deeper than the albeit unusual problems faced by Elspeth in her daily life, wheras Wyndam constantly presents not only a masterfully woven plot and characterisation, but also a discussion of the moral and philosophical dilemma that man's ability to wreak such terrible destruction creates. I would suggest that anyone who enjoyed the Obernewtyn series as a child read THE CHRYSALIDS as an adult, when the difference between the two can be fully appreciated."
5,"An excellent pageturning book, well worth reading","The Farseekers is a well woven tale picking off where Obernewtyn left off, in the heart of a working misfit community. Despite her new found acceptance at Obernewtyn, Elspeth is restless to leave. Dressed as a gypsy, in a false rig, Elspeth and a few others dare to venture to Sutrium and Aborium to complete three missions vital to Obernewtyn. Druids, rebels and soldierguards are all a part of the adventure, and soon Elspeth begins to wonder what she was running from in the first place."
2,Isobelle Carmody improves with this book,"I am reading Farseekers now, and have noticed that the characterization and plotting have improved in Farseekers as opposed to Obernewtyn. I still find the grammatical and word choices distracting. Also, I would like to echo what another reviewer mentioned about the heroine, Elspeth having every possible convenience when it comes to her mental powers. It makes the whole premise less believable to me. Also, people come and go with too much convenience to the plot and not enough motivation. All this is very distracting, but the story idea is interesting, and it appeard that the writing level is improving. Hopefully the next book will be even better."
5,Good Transit Interpretation Book,"It is not as thorough as Robert Hand's ""Planets In Transit""..but is nearly as good..and more concise.I would recommend as an addition to Robert Hands book and Francois Sakoian's book ""Predictive Astrology"" for understanding planetary transits."
3,a bit disappointed,"This is a lovely cookbook, beautiful photos, very clear recipes, but I have to admit that I was disappointed enough to send it back. After reading the reviews, I was anticipating something on the order of the Silver Palette series, which are my favorite cookbooks, but this one was too simplistic for me. As some others have commented, there are not very many recipes given the size of the book and none of them struck me as very new or interesting. In sum, this is probably a great cookbook for people who are ""quick-cooks"" but for those of us who like to delve into our cooking a bit more, it falls short."
3,I would give it 3.5 stars but that wasn't a choice...,"This is a visually beautiful cookbook. Some of the recipes are less-than-basic, but worth it -- I have gotten ""best ever"" reviews on a couple recipes. Certain recipes however are hit or miss and require a little ad-libbing. For example the salmon with fennel was missing something, beef bourgonion sauce reduced to nothing, the coconut cream cheese frosting yields twice the amount necessary (even if you dump the frosting on!) and the guacamole requires at least double the spices.....(the cupcakes and the guacamole by the way, are both excellent as is the whole chicken.) I don't know - maybe they got tired in the test-kitchen before they finished the book. Still worth the purchase - when it's good it's great."
5,The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook,"At Christmas time my very large family get together . I have never been fond of cooking fish,but this time I tried the salmon with fennel and itturned out really nice. Thanks Ina"
4,Inspiration to cook!,"Without reading a recipe, the pictures alone will inspire anyone to want to try these wonderful dishes."
5,I love this book!,"I just received my copy of the Barefoot Contessa today, and I haven't hardly been able to put it down! The recipes sound wonderful, look fairly easy to prepare, and I love reading the little description about each recipe! I am especially eager to make the split pea soup that Steven Speilberg enjoyed! The pictures are great as well! Thank you NBC Today Show for telling us about this wonderful book!"
5,Wonderful EVERY time!,"The Barefoot Contessa has raised the bar on cookbooks. Every recipe I've made in each of her 3 books has come out well if not wonderful! I previously thought this just could not be done because no one else has done it before (in my experience, anyway), but I have lowered expectations no more! There are nice tidbits of advice in each of them (for example, essential items for the kitchen in ""Home Cooking""), and her love of food and cooking shines through in all of the books.The recipes are fairly to moderately easy, so this book is not for the weekend gourmet who wants to build a chocolate tower for dessert. But it is for ANYONE who like delicious, well prepared food. After making many of her desserts for a friend's party, I was told I should open a shop. I had to tell them there already is a shop--and it's owned by Ina Garten!P.S. I met her at a book signing on 2/7 in NY, and she was very kind and personable to everyone in that VERY long line! What a doll!"
5,Every recipe is fabulous,"I am a serious cook and have been reading raves about Ina's store for years. This is a visually beautiful cookbook - her recipes are marvelous and every one that I tried turned out beautifully. Good food does not have to be complex. I tried every dessert - They were all great. It's breezy tone is wonderful, like a lazy summer's day."
2,I should have known better,"I like Ina, don't get me wrong. I am quite disappointed in this book, however. Perhaps it is because I am a pretty good cook with a background of working the front of restaurants. I found this too, too simple. Four of the vegetable recipes are: toss the vegetable in olive oil, salt and pepper and roast on a cookie sheet. The cheese section actually says to go to a good cheese store and buy the best and then arrange it attractively.I needed to be told that?I should have know better. Her show is mostly a ""lifestyle magazine"" of sorts,Ina buying beautiful produce from her friends in their boutique (expensive) stores. and sharing these treats with a friend and a glass of wine.I guess, I want her life, more than her book."
5,EXCELLENT but not for the health-conscious!,"Beautifully written and photographed, and unlike most cookbooks that come from famous eateries, the recipes are really doable. I've tried the Grilled Lemon Chicken, French Potato Salad and Banana Crunch Muffins, and all were excellent. However, everything is LOADED with fat (the muffins have 2 sticks of butter for 18 jumbo muffins, plus coconut, whole milk, nuts, etc.). I reduced the fat and sugar in the muffins and they still tasted great. I hope I'll get good results with slimming down other recipes -- otherwise this will be a splurge-time-only book for me!"
4,Hit and Miss,"I love watching Ina. I've made quite a few recipes, followed her book exactly, using only the finest ingredients and some were absolute flops. The ginger chicken turned out bad, the turkey meatloaf was not good but the roasted chicken was fabulous, as were the coconut cupcakes a big hit. The recipes are easy to follow but are very expensive to make. The ingredients are costly, she lives a luxurious life, she spends a lot of money making this food, and they are created for more than the average family so if something does not turn out you have spent a lot of money and have to either throw it out or literally eat it."
5,I love ALL the Barefoot Contessa cookbooks!,"As a collector of cookbooks, I have discovered very few have more than one or two recipes I actually use all the time. Not so with the Barefoot Contessa books! Her recipes are delicious; but more importantly for me, they are fast and easy while still being special enough for entertaining or family dinners. I use her books all the time and have given ""sets"" of them to my daughters-in-law as gifts."
5,Ya Gotta Love Ina!,"She really IS a ""down to earth"" chef & writer! I love her show, because she is so unaffected and sincere. To be honest, it took me awhile to warm up to her... but now, I feel like she's a friend.(Ina, if you're out there, I'd love an invite to one of your cozy dinners!)She gives you all the info you need to create the recipes in the book - not just the ingredients. She imparts a lot of great inside info on what to look for, and how to buy & prepare it, without getting too wordy.I don't know about you, but I dislike a lot of ""text"" in a cookbook. I want the main event: the RECIPES!!! And pictures of what they should look like! This book has gorgeous pictures & descriptions.I recommend this book to everyone looking for impressive, yet simple, entertaining ideas."
5,Incredible!,"Even better than five stars!I've had this book for several days and have tried the following: Sun-dried Tomato Dip; Grilled Lemon Chicken with Satay Dip; Vegetable Coleslaw; Szechuan Noodles; Indonesian Ginger Chicken; Turkey Meet Loaf; Shortbread Hearts; ""Linzer"" Cookies; and Pecan Shortbread. All I can say is ""On My Gosh""! I've been cooking and entertaining all my life, and have never tasted such wonderful dishes! My husband hates peanut butter, but thought that he had ""died and gone to heaven"" with the Satay Dip and Szechuan Noodles. The last thing that I need is another cookbook. However, I'm so impressed with ""The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook"" that I've ordered two more of Ina's cookbooks. The recipes are easy to follow and sure to elicit the same ""Oh My Gosh"" responses!"
5,Simple and Delicious,I thought this book was great. I have made several of the recipes out of it and have had rave reviews when I served them to my guests. The Pan Fried Onion Dip is delicious. I had people that don't normally like dip rave about it. I loved it so much that I got her new cookbook also and loved it just as much if not more. I think this book is a must have.
3,Barefoot Contessa ...,I enjoy Ina's TV show so thought that one of her cookbooks would make a good Christmas present for my daughter-in-law as she loves to cook. The book was disappointing to me as there were very few recipes. I had seen other Barefoot Contessa Cookbooks that contained many recipes and was wanting something along this line. The presentation was beautiful but I would have preferred good recipes in place of the multiple pages of pictures.
4,Good--but a repeat of the other recipes she has...,"Like her other books, this one is beautiful with wonderful recipes. I bought all three--this one, the basics one, and the recipes you will make over and over again one. Between the three of the them I noticed similar recipes in all--the chocolate cake, the roasted veggies, the chicken, among others. I still love her recipes despite this, but if you are looking to start with one of her books, choose just one and get your hands on the other two to thumb through them before buying all three."
5,A delectable cookbook for the senses & the tastebuds!,"I've been a fan of Ina Garten since watching her Barefoot Contessa cooking show on the Food Netwrok. The recipes in this book are amazing, truly a feast for the senses, and are relatively easy to prepare, even for a non-gourmet cook like me. The dishes are accompanied by beautiful pictures, and what always impresses me about Ina's presentation is her down-to-earth manner, even in writing. I love her philosophy of entertaining, in that it need not be a cumbersome chore, but rather, something to take in stride , with the recipes being made ahead, and hence leaving plenty of time for the host/hostess to mingle with their guests. This cookbook is a refreshing breath of fresh air in the field of cookbooks for entertaining, and a winner from the ever delightful Ina!"
4,Great Recipies for Entertaining,"This book is terrific! I was looking for a good cookbook with simple recipes for entertaining and I found it in this one. If you love food and cooking, but you have a life outside your kitchen, this book is for you.Though not all the recipes are simple, the majority are, and many of the others are worth the effort. I had a party two nights ago and served the Grilled Lemon Chicken with Satay Dipping Sauce. It was a HUGE hit."
5,"Okay, okay, who needs another brownie recipe?","You do. The pan called for is a half-sheet pan, so you might have to buy it. But it's worth it. I'm not kidding. I wouldn't have thought about making a different recipe from the one I usually use, but my friend who is a pastry chef, told me these were great. She wasn't kidding. Follow the directions EXACTLY. Everything else I've tried is fabulous too. But the brownie recipe is worth the price of admission."
3,"A beautiful cookbook, in need of slight revision","I've used this book to prepare for several parties, and I found the recipes easy to follow and the results tasty. However, for a book focused on entertaining, one that suggests preparing as much as possible in advance, there are no specific directions on when to stop preparing, when to add finishing touches and reheat. (It took a LONG time for the refrigerated Parmesan Smashed Potatoes to get hot -- the whole dinner was delayed.) I am not a pro, and I need the advice. Books like Lora Brody's Entertaining Survival Guide are more useful, in giving advice on doubling the recipe, freezing, etc. This is an irritating oversight in such a beautiful book. The Indonesian Ginger Chicken took a lot of chopping of ginger and garlic to make the sauce and after all that effort tasted just like Teriyaki sauce."
5,Cookbook Virgin No Longer!,"I hate cookbooks. I'm intimidated by kitchen gadgetry and oils/spices that end up collecting dust in my pantry. Being a first time stay-at-home mom, I was determined to give this book a try....and WOW....my family and friends are RAVING about my new cooking skills. I've tried most of the soups and the turkey meatloaf is so yummy, my sister has agreed to babysit twice a week because her husband is addicted to my loafs. Ina's easy-to-read format and ingredients make the BFC my kitchen godmother. I'm so proud that my new book already has dog-eared pages with food stains on it. Thanks Ina!"
3,Not the best Barefoot Contessa Book,"I have all of the Barefoot Contessa books. This is a good cookbook, I love her style, good food, simple recipies. My favourites though, are the Barefoot in Paris and Barefoot Contessa Family style. I just didn't find enough usable recipies in this one for my taste."
5,The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook : Secrets from the East Hamp,"This is one of the best cookbooks I have ever purchased. The recipes are generally very easy to make, and the food turns out exactly as the author describes (I'd like to say that's because of me, but I think it's the well-tested recipes in the book).I highly recommend this book (and her other book Barefoot Contessa) because of its ease of use, successful recipes, delicious food, inspiring photos, and nice prose. It's a winner! And the lime curd is absolutely the best I've ever tried!!"
3,Ok,"I love the layout of this book but I have made three recipes out of this book already and had problems with two. The pan-fried onion dip was delicious but extremely heavy. The coconut cupcakes were good but cut the frosting recipe in half and the sun dried tomato dip does not need the extra salt. I also feel the this book was too expensive for the amount of recipes you get. Visually stunning, but wait until it goes on sale to buy it."
4,Not for the average cook,"I dabble in cooking. When we have people over I like to try new things and that's why I have cookbooks. I also think I am pretty good at following recipes. That being said, I thought this cookbook was kind of hard to follow. As other reviewers have stated, everything sounded and looked beautiful but this is no simple throw some ingredients together and make a meal book. I see that this is how she does it in her show. I found this book to be a lot of work. For example, the crab cakes, which were delicious, had 26 ingredients. Maybe this is no big deal for the PT chefs out there, but I am not in that group. I'm going to stick with Rachel Ray. I did, however, like that there were recipes that are much different from those found in other books."
5,The Best Cookbook,I have sent this Cookbook to about 6 people I love over the years. This is the best. Easy and delicious food. Every cook should have a copy of this on their shelf.
5,New Year's Eve Party Perfect!,"I made four recipes from this book, not previously tried, for NY Eve party that night. Lemon chicken turned out delectable, but when paired with her Satay Sauce to dip the chicken in, superb flavors married together! And her signature cupcake: buttermilk made the cake close to wedding cake consistency, with sweet, flaked coconut in the batter plus added to the cream cheese icing. I put them in Tulip papers from King Arthur Flour Co. and sprinkled good ""dust"" from Wilton over the coconut floating on the creaminess of the icing. They looked and tasted magical. Everything was a total Hit. Preparation was very easy and nearly every ingreient was easily available. My belief in Ina was confirmed by my virgin voyage with her recipes and suggestions, making each of us winners. I highly recommend this treasure."
5,This cookbook is fabulous!!!,"I gave this book to my sister for Christmas and now I have to buy one for myself. I made a number of her dishes from the cookbook and from her TV show over the holidays. They have all been outstanding. If you only make one recipe, try to the coconut macaroons. I've made them four times since Christmas. The pecan squares are also amazing, although I did find the size of this recipe somewhat daunting. I had enough squares to feed an army! I highly recommend this book and trying out her recipes. You won't be sorry."
4,Just good food,"Simple food, made with fresh ingredients. This is the core premise of The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook. The recipes are easy to follow and are accompanied by gorgeous photographs so you can see what the dish will look like. No outlandish ingredients, just good, familiar food.My husband and I particularly like the orange yogurt, the Indonesian Ginger Chicken, and the guacamole. Being half Arab, I can attest to the fact that the hummus recipe is absolutely authentic (even though there isn't much to hummus). The ONLY reason that I haven't rated this book a 5 is that most of the recipes are high in fat. (Gotta watch the old waistline . . . !)"
4,You will not be disappointed...,This cookbook exudes elegant simplicity. Not only does it include wonderful (tasty) recipes but insightful words of wisdom for the novice entertainer.
5,Great Resource,"This is one of my favorite books by the Contessa. It's plain and simple to understand and is a great starter book for new cooks or people just starting to cook at home. She has great, cheap recipes in here and they are healthy options. I recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to cook simple, healthy, cheap meals."
2,Nice basic book but there are problems with the recipes,"I liked this book and I think Ms Garten has a good concept of American food, but some of the recipes are a disaster. For example, the chocolate cake has no baking temperature and the icing recipe makes twice too much. Ms Garten, next time you write a book please make sure the recipes are fullproof! Many of the recipes are credited to outside sources, which weakens the credibility of the author. I also think this book could have used a bit more work before going to print. Otherwise the book is OK. It certainly contains the kind of food we all love to eat. The muffin recipes are fantastic! Good for a beginner or a casual gourmet."
5,The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook review,Love this book! Received it within days of ordering as expected and in perfect condition. Would purchase again. Price very competitive. Very pleased.
2,Three recipes did not work!!,"While I am not a gourmet, I am a pretty good cook and three recipes I tried did not come out well. the crabcakes had too much liquid, the turkey meatloaf was not very flavorful and the texture was leaden, and the onion dip was just plain bad!! The recipes all look good in the photos, but I will not waste time and money trying any more. anyone interested in a second hand book?"
2,Not worth purchasing...,"As a private chef who used to work in homes in East Hampton, I was not impressed with the selections described in this book. I was expecting more Entree salads such as those which I used to purchase at the Barefoot Contessa... instead, this book contained almost common sense recipes with no educational value... Great for a novice cook... not worth the time for a chef."
2,Disappointing,I purchased this book mostly due to the other reviews I read. I am returning it because there were no recipes I thought I would use. All were kinda strange and didn't stir my taste buds at all. I'm surprised since I watch her on Food Network and really like most of what she does. Guess I just picked the wrong cookbook.
2,Definitely Boring!,"I bought this cookbook years ago and have only ever made the baked chicken from it, because all the other recipes look so boring. This would be a good beginner's cookbook for someone who just moved out of the house for the first time and doesn't know the basics."
2,Ju Ju wants a Waistline,"These recipes are too rich for my taste. The amounts of butter and cream scare me really. It may taste great, but Ju Ju likes a waistline."
2,Basic Cuisine,"If you are at all a foody, you will find this book has very little to offer. I'm sure the restarant is an experience, but I was disappointed in the span of recipes. Not much there that you can't find in your current home library."
2,I'd rather keep my figure thanks,"Sure these recipes are delicious, many variations or adaptions of recipes that have been floating around for years. But as I read through the book, I kept thinking ""Been there, done that."" I remember making fanastic lemon and pecan squares back in the 80s. Back then, my waistline could handle it. But as I get in to my 60s, I would rather exercise and maintain my figure than reach for those 2 sticks of butter. It's all a choice really, and if I am going to indulge, I'd rather have champagne. That's enough."
1,Recycled Martha.,"Garten is probably the most egregious of all the ""hobby job"" cooks (one could NEVER call them chefs) flogged by the Food Network (followed closely by the laughably inept Sara Moulton and Rachael Ray). Here as in her other books, she recycles recipes done earlier and better by Martha Stewart (her obvious role model), Bert Greene, Lee Bailey, etc. Better to buy books by professionally trained, working chefs like Tyler Florence, Bobby Flay, Mario Batali, etc. or at the very least, by truly gifted home cooks like Nigella Lawson or Nigel Slater. You might actually learn something original from them."
5,She has a new book: Barefoot Contessa Parties!,"I purchased this book and was immediately looking forward to the next book I knew Ina Garten would be writing. If you want to make a friend very happy, you could buy them both books and wrap them up for a wonderful gift.While this cookbook is equally comfortable on the coffee table as it will be in the kitchen, I can tell you the recipes are wonderful. While it won't stay on the coffee table for long - you will want to read it from cover to cover.I always love the fact that a cookbook has so much life energy poured into it. You will love both cookbooks. I just finished making the chicken chili in her second book: Barefoot Contessa Parties.We have another winner! So, don't miss out on her second cookbook. I highly recommend both cookbooks.~The Rebecca Review"
5,Beautifull book,Love this book; I'm a big fan of the barefoot Contessa. The recipes are simple and Delicious. I would recommend it to everyone. I already gave this book as a gift to 2 of my girlfriend and there were delighted!I also bought Simple and Simply Delicious by Sylvie Rocher ...Great book. Simple and Delicious recipes
4,Beautiful cookbook/Easy to use,"This book is beautiful to look at; the full-size photos of the dish, the thick, glossy pages, and the additional notes next to the recipes make this a useful addition to any cook's collection. (It would make a perfect gift, too!) Yes, the recipes do call for extra-large eggs but, so what?! Buy a dozen!! I also especially liked the source lists at the end of the book. The recipes I've made all came out really well; there is something for everyone here."
3,Tastes like candy... in a bad bad way,"I Love candy, and my biggest problem with normal protein is not being able to force myself to drink it through the awful taste. I tried syntrax nectar and is the perfect solution for those trying to get more protein without the awful taste, or time to make a shake, jsut put the nectar in a bottle of water, shake and go.However the Crystal sky flavor was so hard for me to drink, it taste like ground up smarties tabs,and it can eat 8 packets of smarties in a row, I love them.But this drink is just sickly sweet, it makes me feel like my teeth will rot out from under me, I love sweee things but this take it to such an extreme that I have to choke it down."
4,Rare bird book,My father loves it; it was for him. He is happy. 9 more words required to fill in this review.
1,Crack!,"I bought this item because it is advertised as oven-safe up to 500 degrees. My first use of it was in a 475-degree oven. Twenty-minutes passed, and then -- Crack!"
4,Classical Considerations review,"Classical Considerations shows the relevance of ancient literature to modern life. It is an excellent book for students of Latin. Also, it could help turn youngsters toward studying the classics. The book has many quotations from Latin and Greek, and it makes the meanings clear. The quotations are followed by translations, explanations, and narratives in English. The writers include professors, teachers, housewives, a basketball coach, a former army officer, and a teenager. Some of the writers give scholarly explanations. Others tell what lines from classics meant in their own lives."
3,Very liberal American,"This book is a collection of quotations from authors writing in Latin and Greek, along with modern authors' comments. I'm not sure I'm impressed; it's a beautifully laid out book, but the illustrations aren't great and seem irrelevant, and we have 54 quotations in a fairly expensive package. Several commentaries are also very specific to today's US (and invariably from a liberal perspective), which seems a very narrow view for the title and contents; to pick one example, posterity will probably not look back with pride on illustrating a quote on living for posterity with an attack on George Bush, who happened to be president at the time of the writing."
4,hard to find these,came with no inst which could be a problem for newbies. Basically it's pretty straight forward but the type of antenna wire these are used with is a real pain to work with. I ruined one on my first attempt but got thing right the second time so it's a good thing it's a pack of five.
4,Fascinating!,"This book shows the truth of the tour de france, full of real human emotions, it will rock your world!"
1,I have a better suggestion,"""Wild Style"" is for the die-hard fans of either 'early hip-hop' or 'old school graffiti.' As a film, the plot plods along, the editing is inconsistent, and the acting is far from engaging.Granted, we see the original artists at work (Lee, Lady Pink, etc.) but it might have had a smoother feel if the cast were made up of (at the very least) collegiate actors. Considering ""Lee"" is portraying not himself, but a character named ""Zorro,"" why not use actors who could deliver a better performance?I enjoyed the video overall (only because I was there in NYC and had met Lee in the late 70's) but if you're interested in a quality production on the origins of NYC rap and what graffiti bombing (back in the day) were really like, then I suggest you hunt down a copy of the '82 ""Style Wars."" Amazon would be doing a great service to the graffiti world if they marketed that video instead of this inept production."
1,about the Paulie's review,"On thing is sure is that I find scandalous this changing of music in the movie, sorry for the company but won't buy it, I was going to. They could also have added lots of extras. Otherwise the greatest hip hop movie of all time."
2,Not As Great As All The Hype,I hear all the time as i read hip hop mags and articlesall about how great Wild Style IS THE BEST HIP HOP movieever. Well I purchased it at the first of the year and guesswhat it cant't hold Beat Street and Breakin or Krush Groovesjockstrap. I think the movie Rappin or even the not so getLorenzo Lamas Hip Hop movie Body Rock has moments that'seven better than Wild Style. People who read this willprobably say what gives you the right to think you know so muchwell me being 30 years old you can do the math. Thats around when the Hip Hop movement started. So if your a movie collector.Go ahead and buy it but if you want a good movie to watch.Then purchase somthing else.
3,Two ways to look at this . . .,"After reading the other reviews, and watching the movie, I think there are two ways to look at this film. One way is to note the terrible acting, thin and predictable plot, and the cheap production look. The other way is to focus on the performance clips. They are genuine, authentic, and the reason to even make a movie like this. The performance clips of rapping, break dancing, and scratching seem more like documentary footage of the early days of hip-hop. I found myself fast-forwarding through the ""acting"" and focusing on the performances. As a whole, this was not a particularly entertaining movie, but its real value is watching the performances."
4,Old School to the fullest!,"This was my first time watching this movie! I heard of this movie, but i never get a chance to watch it! Wild-Style was the first movie before Beat Street, Krush Groovin, Breakin (Part 1 & 2), Rappin, Back on the Block, Juice, The Show, Brown Sugar, and 8-Mile. This is the history of the true meaning of hip-hop! This movie is on point! Even doe I'm from the Dirty South, I still enjoy this movie and still can be apart of rap! Hip-Hop still lives on from the past present and future!Thanks!Dee SmallsRepresenting:Decatur, GA."
1,horrible!,"this is a horrible box set, picture transfer is horrible, sound quality horrible and for some reason the main title screen plays the HALLOWEEN 2(1981) movie music for some reason. This is horrible do not buy this crap!"
5,Permanent spot in our cd player,"My mom bought this cd early this summer and it has become a permanent installment in our kitchen cd player. What a beautiful cd from Alison Krauss! She does duets with James Taylor (another of my fav artists), Brad Paisley, and John Waite and does them beautifully. The song ""Jacob's Dream"" is a hauntingly beautiful and sad song about two boys lost in the mountains; based on a true story. ""Whiskey Lullaby"" is the duet with Paisley...what a sad song! The incdredible guitar skills coupled with Alison Krauss' beautiful voice makes for an incredible song that sends chills down my spine every single time I hear it. ""Missing You"" is a fun, upbeat song Krauss did with John Waite. It comes to the top as one of my favorites.My recommendation? Buy this cd! It is so totally worth it!"
5,Alison Krauss Review,Enjoyed this CD very much. I have almost everything she has recorded and this is one of her best
4,Allmost,"Let me begin by saying that I am an QAllison Krauss fan without exception and this is an really good cd.It would be an exceptional cd from any other entertainer,but I beleve that Allison Krauss can deliver bettwer than this.The problem I have is the prviously recorded songs.It seems like she started to write songs for a new cd and running out of steam just gave up and used them for fillers.It is still a great cd and I would recomend it to any fan."
3,Very depressing CD,"My husband and I are big fans of Alison Krauss, have seen her in concert 2 times, and will see her again tomorrow night in OKC. However, this CD is sooooo depressing! Almost every song is about death or never finding love. That said, her voice is one of a kind and I'll continue to buy whatever she and Union Station (featuring my man Jerry Douglas) put out."
5,Not the usual Alison Krauss and Union Station music,I am a big fan of Alison Krauss. This music is not so much bluegrass. It will make you sing along and leave you humming the rest of the day.
5,What can I say? I like Alison...,"Actually, Alison is a lightning rod of opinions, it seems, and I am a positive one by far. Her clear voice is always a thrill, and this set is a ""Great Songs, part 2"" followup to her multimillion seller, Now That I Found You.Highly recommended Americana, acoustica music."
4,Nightingale's Song,"Being generous, Alison Krauss participates in many projects besides hers and Union Station's, but not all of us can afford all of them just for the 1 or 2 songs heard. This collection compiles recordings from soundtracks, ""Down to the River to Pray"", for instance, from ""Oh' Brother Where Art Thou"", tributes and collaborations (there are three with soft rocker Tom Waites, including ""Missing You""). Given Alison's voice and sensitivity, they are all beautiful. Initially, there is a feeling of too much of a good thing, mostly being mid-tempo, but that feeling eases away as the nuances of each song seep in."
2,Slightly disappointing,"I am a new fan of Allison's, and I must admit, I was disappointed by this album. I found the whole thing to be slow and depressing. There were a few good songs, but mostly all the songs have the same slow tune and melody. I would not recommend this. It is definitely NOT bluegrass."
2,Good Cd if you like Depressing Music,I love Alison Krauss but this cd is very depressing. I would not have bought it if I had heard it before hand. Her other albums are so much more up beat and fun. This one wants to make you go jump off a cliff.
3,Not bad but not a priority buy for Alison Krauss collection either,"I hadn't bought an Alison Krauss CD in years so I decided to get this one when I saw it listed. Ms. Krauss still has a good voice but I wasn't really thrilled with this CD, #6 ""Down to the River to Pray"" I think came out better on the ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" CD, her Duet with Brad Paisley was OK, you could certainly hear both of them, but the James Taylor duet was a waste of time- he was so thoroughly drowned out by Alison that I could have taken his place and no one would've noticed the difference.I won't throw it away but I won't wear this CD out either."
3,It was a good album.,"Haven't listened to it thoughouly yet, but it's made a good impression on me. A good collection."
3,Allison Krauss,It is an OK CD. I think she has put out better ones. Maybe one or two of the songs really stuck in my head.
1,ZERO STARS,"Yuk . . purchased this CD on assumption that it would beas enjoyable as all previous AK purchases. Not so. Boring, dreary, slow -- what else -- did I say Yuk?"
5,This Fan Approves - Highly,"""Jacob's Dream"" made me weep with both its beauty and its sentiment, when I heard it. The spare and perfect instrumentation behind the vulnerable voice of Allison punctuated with the penetrating soprano of the refrains was chilling. I was moved, and that is worth more than the price of admission on that one song alone, but there is much more. My high recommendation.Sure, Union Station wasn't there in toto, but often we see the members names here, plus the other muscians are far from chopped liver. Krauss can have her pick from Nashville where the very best come to play, and the production shows it."
3,Love her but tired of being down,"I love Allison Krauss and own every one of her albums. However, I cannot bring myself to buy this one after hearing the sample songs. I am tired of being depressed and mourning past losses. Where are the songs that celebrate the (albeit, few) joys of life? I will buy Ron Block's music instead this time. I miss her days of gospel and (at least some) uplifting songs."
3,Pleasant country/blue grass stories,This is a very good CD to listen to the words and feeling - tells some heart-wrenching stories
3,Not the usual Alison Krause,A so-so CD. Alison is in great voice as usual but the accompanying music is just not up to par. Most of the music is civil war ballads without any great music backup. Only a couple of songs worth listening to.
4,Another great one for Allison Krauss,I have just about all of her C.D.s. This is another really great one. I really like most of the songs on this album. (There is only about 2 - 3 songs that I am not crazy about.)Allsion Krauss is a rare talent and only seems to get better with time. I have always loved her and I suppose I always will.
3,Disappointment,"This is not Alison's finest. nothing great or new, and too little of her voice and fiddle. Just a disappointment for a fan."
2,disappointed,"There are a few songs on CD I liked. The Duet with Brad Paisley, Molly Braun the Irish song were good but for the most part the music was boring. Nobody in the world sings like Alison but I like her much more with Union Station singing bluegrass-country ballad style of music. This sounds like someone just threw a bunch of movie background songs together with a few good ones to have something to sell."
5,She does it again,Her voice always makes me pause. Her choice of material is always impeccible. This album is another fine example of her talent.
5,All the great ones,"I'm a huge fan of Alison Krauss, and this one has all the greats from the last 5 years or more. I was pleased to find Baby Mine from Dumbo and a few new ones as well."
3,Alison Krauss has a beautiful voice,"Krauss's voice can almost make up for the songs, but I don't believe this collection of music does justice for her tallent."
4,Pure Alison Kruass...,"As usual, Alison comes through with a winning combination of songs delivered by her angelic voice. This CD depicts her country roots, but isn't country 'twangy'. It's a nice compilation of songs. My favorite is ""Down by the River to Pray""...the harmonies are hauntingly lovely and stays with me all day...good album."
4,music,Allison Krauss is truly talented and easy to hear Very easy listening music. Highly recommended. Thank you. Thank you much
1,Notice it isn't called 'the best of' or 'greatest hits'.,"After listening to this cd a few times I gave up on her. I didn't like a single song on this collection. Fortunately, after getting rid of it, I found a copy of New Favorite Thing at a used cd store and since she sounded so good on Raising Sand I decided to give her another try. I'm glad I did. New Favorite Thing is a very enjoyable album. This collection - A Hundred Miles or More- is not a good introduction for new listeners. Seems more of a repository of odds and ends."
5,Sterling Krauss Collection,"Although this may seem to be (and may have been intended to be) a motley collection of Alison Krauss' recording not released on any of her previous solo recordings or with Union Station, the strength of this release is the same strength of any of her recordings - her clear, clean, pure voice.Whether it's duets with John Waite (""Missing You,"" and ""Lay Down Beside Me""), Brad Paisley (""Whiskey Lullaby""), or James Taylor (""How's The World Treating You""), or solo efforts like ""Molly Ban,"" ""You Will Be My Ain True Love,"" and ""Down To The River To Pray,"" Krauss' voice is beautiful and majestic. ""A Hundred Miles or More"" is worth buying because anything featuring Alison Krauss is worth having."
3,AK's latest offering,"Although I'm a HUGE Alison Krauss fan, I don't like all of these tracks. Still a great new release"
3,Alison Krauss Better With Union Station,"This CD, which does not pretend to be bluegrass music, suffers from the absence of the Union Station musicians and the lack of upbeat songs. The best song, ""Jacob's Dream,"" is about the death of two pioneer children. Alison Krauss has beautiful vocals, but I was not entertained by the material. The last CD by Alison Krauss and Union Station, ""Lonely Runs Both Ways."" is terrific."
3,Good But Not Great,"This Girl sings like no one else, but this CD could use a little jacking up. If it's mood music you want this may do it but don't look for any peppy stuff in this CD. Had I heard what was on it I would have passed it up."
4,Fantastic Video for Children of All Ages!!!!,"Candy Claus is a fantastic video. I grew up watching it, and when I found it here, I loved it completely. Candy is a doll given to Santa by a gernerous family. She is part of a set. Once Santa finds her, she is his daughter. At times, she becomes a doll once again."
3,What happend to Alec Empire?,"The music for Alec Empire's new single, ""shards of poll pottery"" is no ""destroyer"" but that doesn't really matter. The music is more drum and bass and if you liked ATR's ""Rage"" single then you'll like this. That is if you like your hardcore with out Alec or Hanin singing. Long gone are the day's of Hunt down and kill the Nazi's or Raver bashing. Now what we have to look farward to is bad rapping and i just don't care for the direction that DHR is heading. Kicking Bomb 20 and Ec8or (or atleast Patric C. has left) out either for being to hardcore or just becasue Alec Epire is to much of a bussiness man good hardcore will no longer be on DHR, but not to worry. After seeing Ec8or this summer you'll be happy to know some people are still in it for the music and not just to make money..."
4,Nice,Nice looking watch. The links are easy to remove yourself so you can size it to your wrist easily. Not sure how it will hold up over time but very nice watch for the price.
3,"SO So picks - Good feel, Very fragile!","OK, so the concept for these picks is good, but the execution has flaws.Rather than printing a friction texture on the pick, the texture is actually MOLDED into the pic through small holes that go through the pick. The good thing about this is that the texture isnt coming off, period. the bad thing is that the holes make the pick SUPER easy to break if you're even moderately rough on a pick, like with, say, Strumming patterns.I got a 5 pack of these to test out and ALL five broke within a couple weeks.These are probably great picks for picking strings, but certainly not for strumming and hard hammering on your strings.On the good side, they feel great in your hand and they dont like to fling out of your hands....I probably wont buy them again unless i ran into a very very good deal."
4,"BlakeRadio.com features Track in ""New Artist Spotlight""",Gerri King is here to stay!! Nuendo Music Group has a winner!!
4,A& E Literary Classics,"Great fun, interesting collection. Nice break from the dreck that is put out by Hollywood now."
2,Disappointing,Found the productions to be to risque for family fare. Not what I had in mind (besides Horatio Hornblower which I love).
3,"HAWKWIND-'Weird Tape, Volume 5 Live '76 & '77'(Voiceprint)","Starts off with ""Back On The Streets"", a tune that several diehard fans I've touced base with do not dig this song at all.Maybe 'cause it's got a vibe similar to Saxon or say,Motley Crue.I,personally liked it.Next is a good version of ""City Of Lagoon"".Both are from a live 1976 gig,along with ""Where Are They Now?"".From an unlisted 1977 show,there's ""Brainstorm"",""Wind Of Change"" and a jammin' version of ""Assassins Of Allah"".One can really hear Simon House's violin playing on ""Forge Of Vulcan"" and ""Steppenwolf"""
3,Not as useful as hoped.,Item is rather expensive when compared to similar non-Weber items.Found the clearance between the grates and the rotisserie was small and larger items required removing the grates.Removing grates is kind of a hassle and then you cannot grill other items at the same time.Item works good but would not purchase again.
3,HP and the Order of the Phoniex,"I like this game, it is fun. Its more challenging on the Playstation 2 version but I enjoy this game and anyone who love Harry Potter on Gameboy is bound to enjoy this game."
3,Extremely Basic,The art work in this book is beautiful; she is a talented artist. She gives some good ideas however her book is too basic there are not any real step-by-step projects to put to practice what you learn in the book. I am looking for a book that give basic explantion and projects to work on.
2,Not effective,I used this for several weeks and it did notwork very well. Saw no improvement whatsoever. Do not recommend this.
2,No progress so far,"This is my second bottle and at least six months of use but I have seen no progress. I know treating toe nail fungus is a looooong time project and you have to be patient, which is why I bought the second bottle - hope to see results when this bottle is empty."
1,Buyer Beware,"This product is advertised on Amazon as a cure for fungus under the nails, yet a warning on the package clearly states that it is not to be used on the nails. It's basically just an athlete's foot remedy like Tinactin or Lamasil, which don't claim to cure nail fungus."
1,Waste of money!!!,"This was a waste of money! It smells completely awful and on top of that it doesnt work. Very disappointed with this product, but the seller did ship it fast, so thats the one star rating."
5,good stuff!!,"I have tried so many products with no results. For the last 2 weeks I have been using no miss after soaking my feet in pedifix tea tree soaking crystals foot bath, and my toe nail is already looking better. :)"
1,Did not work.,"Unfortunately this product did not fix the toe nail problem. Would not ever buy again. Not for me. Good luck if you buy this, hope it works for you."
1,Didn't work for toenail fungus,"Even though the nail has been filed down with a rotary file and all the infection removed, this product had no effect. I am going to try one more product and then go to the podiatrist to try laser."
1,Fungus,Which it would have worked as my finger nail is brown.Used alot but it makes it look alittle better but did not get rid of the fungus!My finger nail is not growing and is pretty much dead.
1,Fungus killer??,"No Miss Fungus Killer Antifungel 1/4ozThis product did not do anything to may fungus, I used it for more than 45 days and just wasted my time. I was told that I needed to be consistent and I was using the fungus killer twice a day, but still did not do anything. I wont recommend this product to any one."
5,No MISS: No joke!,"I really needed help...something that would work. For the price, I figured it was worth a shot. I have tried everything I could find before and had no results. I have had a discolored big toe for years and it had continually gotten worse by chipping/flaking and practically disentegrating on my foot. I even noticed that is was beginning to infect my other nails. This product in combination with ZetaClear worked wonders. Not only have my toenails cleared up but my pedicurist has also noticed a real improvement too. I am looking forward to summer again. Great product and very easy to use."
1,Give em' a ZERO for Quality Control,"Well, where can I start. The questions don't work properly at all. The score doesn't tally correctly in practice mode, and some of the questions don't have the right VB code to toggle required features. Cmon, Sybex. How can you even think of releasing a product without minimal quality control. I was really dissapointed with this product. Would have rated it a zero if I could. I wrote the sybex people, and did not get what I felt was a proper response..so not only is this product lousy, they have poor customer service. I've purchased MANY Sybex products, and have been happy with all of them except this one. Sybex lost me as a customer here."
5,A varied playlist.,"Albeit I didn't agree with all the choices, a lot of thought went in to the choosing of this varied music selection. There is something for just about everyone who loves popular music. You will enjoy the well-rounded music choices. Personally, I would like to have seen music selections from the 1930's and 1940's (various genres) included. However, I realize I'm not as contemporary as most others may be. Thank you Mr. Whitburn for producing yet another compelling music compilation!"
4,Almost Perfect,"if you own over 100 gig of music like I do, then you owe it to yourself to pick this up.Would have love to have seen more ""lists""."
4,This was a good movie,"This was the first Mirthworm movie I saw as a kid. and when I saw there were more Mirthworm movies, I had to see the rest of them. I thought it was funny how the bad guys were defeated and was glad to see that crystal found the courage to go on stage."
4,A good overview of Today's Health Services,"This book provides an easy to read compilation of the important factors that influence today's health care services. It compares national and international health care systems. Emphasis is placed on health care economics. Health care for designated populations such as ambulatory clients, long term care clients & mental health clients is addressed. There is a strong chapter on health care policy and heatlh care planning."
1,Essentials of Health Services,"For a very small book containing 191 pages, the price was way out of line."
1,A book not about Huskies,"I felt cheated when I got this book.It is not a book about Huskies. It's a book about general dog care, and not a particularily good one at that. Except for the photographs and a brief discussion of the breed, it could be just about any breed. The emphase is on home and show, and definitively not on Arctic dogs. For example, there is more than two times more text on preventive dental care than on dog sledding.The same publisher has published essentially the same book with a different title ('Alaskan Malamutes') and a different author name.I'm sure that anyone with a serious interest in Siberian Huskies would find this book next to useless."
5,review,"This books helps out so much. It teaches parents self control with your children. The only thing it is lacking is a consequence for misbehavior. Yes, talking through things has helped out a lot but sometimes I need something more."
3,Helpful,"I would have to re-read this particular book, but I remember it being accurate; and the title is true and sincere."
3,Anyone remember Ramona Quimby?,"I was really getting into the strategies in this book until I got to chapter 10 where the reasons for misbehavior are discussed. Her first anecdote was about Bryan, the little boy who didn't want to go to school. It was eventually discovered that he didn't want to go to school because his teacher had asked him to ""sit here for the present."" When he didn't get an actual present, he became disappointed and thus didn't want to go to school anymore. Amusing story, only if you think about it long enough, you'll remember that Ramona Quimby actually had this same experience on her first day of kindergarten in Ramona the Pest. What are the chances that this fictional experience actually occurred in real life? It has made me question the validity of the rest of the book. I think we'll have to move onto to a new book because I just can't take this one seriously anymore."
1,"Re: Review by ....Kelly ""kelly-lcce""","I just wanted to say ""THANK YOU!"" ....Your review was enough to make me save my money & choose something else.Plus I don't like that she says all these horrible things and NEVER HAD A CHILD! There are so many good books out there & written by people with actual parenting experience."
4,Liked,"I like a lot of Gordon Lightfoot's songs, being someone who grew up in the 60's it's refreshing to find and listen to such music"
4,Gords Best,For me this was a replacement for the vinyl I lost in a fire more than 20 years ago. There is something to be said for an album you bought more than once.
4,Gord's Gold,"Great album! But, yes, it is missing ""Affair On 8th Avenue"". That song was on the cassette of this album, but when they went to CDs they apparently didnt have enough room for every song so they left that one off. That's one of my favorites too. I made a point of finding the song to download on my computer though."
4,If You Could Read My Mind...,"Gord's Gold has two of my favorites ""Sundown and If You Could Read My Mind."" The album has 21 tracks on one disc. Being relatively young when Gordon Lightfoot emerged, songs such as Carefree Highway, I'm Not Saying, or Minstrel of the Dawn are beginning to grow lightly upon me."
5,More about missing songs,"Just a note to those missing ""Affair on Eighth Avenue"" It now appears on the download version, so I just downloaded it to go with the CD I have had since before the days of downloads. I will then burn a new CD, on which everything should fit. All of you can do likewise. What really perplexes me about the re-recordings in this album is, why didn't Gord record ""The Way I Feel"" for this album? That is among my top 3 favorites from the United Artists years, and was also much covered, by Fotheringay and, I think, Peter Paul and Mary, among other groups."
5,"Still missing ""Affair on 8th Avenue""","When the single CD for the double album first came out, they eliminated the remake of ""Affair on 8th Avenue"" even though CDs at that time handled up to 70 minutes and it would have easily fit. This song, as were the other 'older' songs that comprised the 1st album of the set, was remade/reproduced by Gordon Lightfoot just for this compilation. So the continued unnecessary exclusion of this precious version of this song is a waste of all the original effort that went into making it and a loss for all GL fans.If and when they decide to re-release this CD including ""Affair on 8th Avenue"" (one of my favorite songs from the set), is when I will buy this CD...if just for this version of that song."
3,"Fun Children's Album, But Strictly For Children","Your little tykes might like this album, but it's generally for children between the ages of 1 to 6. The track listing is:1) Buster the Butterfly, 2) Chester the Chimp, 3) Dinah the Dinosaur, 4) Elmer the Elephant, 5) Gertrude the Goldfish, 6) Harold the Hippo, 7) Kitty the Kangaroo, 8) Nancy the Nightingale, 9) Oscar the Octopus, 10) Pinky the Penguin, 11) Reggie the Rooster, and 12) Sammy the Silkworm.Pretty much each song tells the story of a different adventure each animal goes through, though generally to the same to similar tune. A very rare record, if this album or CD ever turns up be sure to add it to your collection. Also keep an eye out for the similarly rare ""Connie Francis and the Kids Next Door""."
4,10-song collection of videos,"I now have this disc.It is an NTSC export edition pressed by Universal Music in Germany.The previous reviewer is incorrect about the song contents.Song line-up is ""Look Away"",""Chance"",""Fields of Fire"",""In a Big Country"",""Peace in Our Time"",""Harvest Home"",""King of Emotion"",""Broken Heart(13 Valleys)"",""One Great Thing"" & ""East of Eden"".All the clips are videos.Would have given it more stars if it had more songs.At least this collection doesn't superimpose the song title at the start of each video,like ""The Ultimate Collection"" did."
3,Review of the Sportline 360 Fitness Pedometer,"This is the 3rd unit I have purchased in 1 year, the first one just fell apart. I use the unit daily, I find that if your battery holder rattles a lot the unit will reset with out warning, if you drop the unit it doesn't hold up well and typically resets. This unit needs to be more robost and manufactured to a higher standard."
4,This product is excellent and very easy to use.,This pedometer is all I expected it to be. Very simple to set up and use and very accurate.
2,Just Not Comfortable to Wear,"This pedometer will show your step count, your jog or hiking count, your steps per mile, jog per mile, calories burned, total miles traveled, and it can automatically cycle through the data. It also has an auto off to save battery life when your not moving.I was so excited to get this one but when I put it on it was so uncomfortable to wear. The top of the clip is angled a bit towards your body and the very top part is not rounded so it digs in. Also, there are deep ridges that look like they are there for a secure grip when removing the pedometer from your waistline. These ridges dig in when I'm sitting and rub when I'm walking or running.If you wear your pedometer on your belt then your clothing will protect you, but if you wear it on your shorts or if you don't wear a belt this is probably not going to be very comfortable.It's too bad the designers didn't think of comfort when designing the top of the clip because it shows a lot of info and it's a nice compact size."
2,"Too many modes, confusing menus, uncomfortable to sit with","I consider myself an experienced gadgeteer, but was baffled to figure out the menus on this thing. Sometimes you have to hold the button for 2 seconds, sometimes for 5 seconds. The mode button itself has multiple modes. The manual refers to the buttons by letter A B C not by their names, and guess what? The letters are not even in order! Then it has sharp edges which tend to dig into your skin when sitting down. And if you are over 280 lbs, the calorie counter feature will not apply to you as it has an upper setting limit of 280 lbs. As for how accurate it is, I cant say, as I cant figure out how to set the stride length, or how to have the display remain on the step count mode."
1,I ran 3 miles per hour!,"I was excited to purchase this small pedometer that had every feature I needed. The only problem is that none of them work. After running my usual three mile route, the pedometer told me that I had run only .3 miles. It also said I had burned under 100 calaries and was running 3.2 mph. I would have not been as upset if at least one function worked, but nothing did!"
4,Good pedometer for the price,"I got this pedometer and I like it. It seems to usually be about 2-8% off in terms of steps but for me, that's close enough. I just want to get an overall idea of my steps and how much I'm doing on a day to day basis. For the price I think it's a good buy. The programming and settings are relatively easy to use."
3,Amon Duul - 'Manana' (Strange Fruit),"Another so-so compilation,believe several of these tracks are available on other Amon Duul releases.As I listened to this CD,I sort of dug the live cuts like ""Ladies Mimmikry"",""Kanaan"" and ""Green Bubble Raincoated Man"" and then it hit me...wait a minute!Aren't these the very same songs that are on their 'BBC In Concert'(see my review)?Unless I miss my guess,they are.Not a bad disc,but strictly for collectors and die-hard Amon Duul fans."
2,Almost 30 years ago...,"Made in UK in 2000, Serial# SFRSCD-097, Playing Time 62:13If you're avid collector of AM2, the first 8 tracks on this disc were originally released back in 1992 on the ""BBC Radio 1 Live In Concert Plus"" album; the last 4 tracks on this disc were recorded for the John Peel radio show.As is the case with most recordings done for the BBC, the recording quality of these ""live in the studio"" documents is near perfect, especially if you consider that this was back in 1973. The renditions on these latter tracks are significantly different from their twins on the first half of the disc.The AM2 of those early days generated original, somewhat off-the-wall, progressive music. Unfortunately, the style sounds somewhat outdated, but remains a great page in the history books of german music."
5,Great Gift Idea!,"Great gift idea. It is perfect to send to someone to help them improve thier health, or just to use as a good reference for natural home remedies using basic plants & herbs. And it's Reasonably priced."
5,Magic and Medicine of Plants,My original book was borrowed and never returned. It was so nice to locate a replacement book for a reasonable price. And the condition of the book was as good as a brand new book.
3,It was decent,"Well, the pictures certainly make it a little easier to identify stuff in the wild, and the dye references, and growing guides are helpful. I am not a very adept gardener so I need all the help I can get. What dissapointed me most was the fact that each herb is limited to a one page section (except for the exotic and poisonous herbs). I was hoping to actually have information on the medicinal uses and at least guidlines on how to prepare them for use. It amazed me that it gives instructions on the harvesting of opium, but has next to no information on the medicinal preparation of plants."
5,Review,"This is a beautiful book filled with facinationg information on a variety of plants and herbs, the history of herbal medicine and information on plant collecting. This is a terrific book for anyone that is interested in herbal remedies, gardening or plant identification."
5,scoutmaster,Book is full of information for a large boy scout troop. We will make use of this weekly as we meet on land where they are many flowers and weeds. John green
5,solar car assembly kit: awesome!,"I bought this for a science project, hoping it was easy to assemble. It really was! I helped my 5th graders assemble it and test run it. They were really happy about the speed and distance traveled. Great product!"
3,"Good series, but one big flaw -- it lacks subtitles","I'm not sure if it is the inherently poor (relative to modern standards) audio quality of a series shot on videotape in the 1970's, or just my lack of comprehension, but I have found most of the episodes I've watched so far (about thirteen) to range from reasonably intelligible to almost complete gibberish. This is due to the variety of fairly thick British, Irish, and Scots accents. At least one episode -- I think it's titled ""The Swedish Tiger"" -- left me scratching my head trying to figure out exactly what had gone on. The plot was convoluted enough that understanding everything that was said was necessary to grasp more than the basics of the action, and I think I may have gotten every fifth word. It's very frustrating."
2,Over acting,"I was disappointed with this expensive purchase. A few very good actors, but mostly over acting by the rest.It seemed they thought they were on the stage. Also the first few were in black & white, due to a strike bytechnicians. I wish I had my money back on this one. I could not wait for one of the servants, Alfred, to bekilled off. James, the son upstairs, was a very poor actor. Normally I love everything the Brits do, but thiswas one big exception."
5,Worth many repeat viewings,"If only current TV shows could be like this! When there is no baseball, football or college basketball to watch, we don't have to settle for The Biggest Loser or Survivor, we can watch this!"
5,Upstairs/Downstairs has always ben a favorite with us and we enjoy watching it again,"we enjoy the series, as it is timeless in its culture and way of life among the Edwardians. We learn more about the early 1900's with each viewing."
5,Upstairs / Downstairs - where it all began,A trip down memory lane with some people we know very well.Service in getting the boxed set was amazingly quick.
5,wonderful memories,"Upstairs Downstairs is just as wonderful as it was when I first watched it on PBS in its first go round. I'm just finishing up watching season three and wish it could go on forever. This is an unforgettable addition to my DVD library, well worth the cost. By the way, I can't imagine why one or two reviewers criticized the technical quality--all but the first few episodes are in color, and the picture and sound quality of all are just fine. Don't let those few complaints discourage you from embarking on an unforgettable experience."
5,Has been digitally re-mastered!,"Absolutely, a first rate transfer of a video production from the seventies. At times on some of the close-ups, you'd swear you are watching HD! Being a TV photographer I can assure you, this is the best quality you'll ever see of a videotaped series. To be honest, I'm really surprised how good this set is. A couple of the early episodes are a little soft, but the rest of the discs, more than make up for them. A classic, with superb acting and great writing. Buy this set....it's ""Upstairs/Downstairs"" at it's best!"
3,"Upstairs, Downstairs","How is it the 40th anniversary collection of this Masterpiece classic does not have subtitles for the hearing-impaired? This show deserves a 6 star rating, but the subtitles are MISSING."
5,First Rate British TV Drama,"Although there are problems with the transfer of this series to DVD, I would nonetheless recommend the purchase of it. Because of previous reviews respecting image quality, I just about did not buy this series, which would have been a big mistake. I have an HD TV, and picture quality is acceptable, given the era when it was filmed. Any technical shortcomings are minimized by great story lines and exceptional performances. Upstairs Downstairs has stood the test of time, and is as superb when it was originally broadcast. This is classic British television drama at its best and an essential addition to any one's DVD collection."
3,Broken disc,"One disc was broken in the package. Wonder if I could get just the one replaced? Even if not, I have had many hours of good program."
3,Wait,"As I have stated in many of my reviews, with technology changing so fast wait. Right now there is Blu-Ray, coming is 3D, so what are we supposed to do with all the expensive sets we have already bought? So far the current 3D Blu Ray players do not say they will play your current standard definition DVDs."
3,Poor Production Values,"I can't say I wasn't warned. Other reviewers of this set have remarked on the poor picture quality. However, since I had been re-watching this series on taped VHS cassettes from a PBS broadcast, I assumed that the DVDs would be an improvement. Wrong. I'm sorry I threw away my tapes. I am very disappointed that A&E would have issued this beloved series on such poor quality DVDs."
3,A few corrections,Since I was the videotape editor on many episodes in this series (from 1970)I thought I would point out a few errors that other reviewers should be aware of.The show was not made by the BBC. It was produced by London Weekend Television (LWT) - part of the commercial ITV network (Independent Television) of the time.At least the first 6 episodes were recorded originally in black and white because there was a technicians strike which demanded more for recording in colour. Episode 1 was re-written and re-recorded in colour to connect with the first colour episode - thus making international sales possible.Mail me if you have further technical queries about this series: david@dareks.fsnet.co.uk
5,A group of people you will care about.,This series is my hands down favourite just ahead of I Claudius A group of wonderful people you will come to love and care about.Upstairs the Bellamys watch over the Downstairs servants. No wonder over one billion people have seen this series from England. I first saw it on Canadian television then on PBS. Both the Canadiann network and PBS showed it without commercials as it will be oin the DVD set.
4,classic,I just have received this set. I have viewed the first 2 episodes and it is as well produced and written as I had anticipated. I saw none of the productions during their initial showing. I am truly looking forward to viewing this whole series this winter.
5,Extremely Pleased,"Upstairs /Downstairs is pure delight! The quality of the film is excellent with the 1st few episodes in black & white due to electricians strike back in the day. All other episodes are in color and the acting is very well done. I highly recommend purchasing this one of a kind item.Happy in Homosasa, FL"
5,You Will Get Hooked!!,"One of those video series you cannot stop watching. We watch it, put it aside, and pull it out again another time. Once you begin to understand the characters, you really get hooked. The entire series is the way to go!"
5,Great!,"Video came in ""New"" condition as specified & came sooner than expected which was great as it was a Christmas gift. :)"
5,Upstairs Downstairs,"Absolutely tops, first rate entertainment. The included bonus series Thomas and Sarah is not quite as riveting but would rate 4 stars. If you like British drama and British humor, this is the set=ries for you."
3,"Had problems, but resolved","I had some problems with the DVD set sent, but they were good in exchanging it and then eventually refunding my money. I'd try them again and appreciate the quick response in refunding the money."
2,Upstairs Downstairs,"I ordered this Collection for my mother for Christmas, with the understanding that the DVDs had closed captioning. Unfortunately, the closed captioning does not work, several people has tried to no avail, and my mother is unable to hear the show, with the British accent. If that problem can be resolved, I know I would be giving it a much higher rating."
3,warning: watch it soon after purchasing,"The picture quality of this version is better than the earlier version, but not anywhere near as good as the original broadcast. It has been cleaned up with the result that some of it looks too bright, which is almost as annoying as the blurry version released earlier. Also, the picture on my copy freezes up at least once during most of the episodes I have watched so far, often so badly that I have to restart the episode and skip that part. I checked it on two other brands of DVD players and it froze in exactly the same place every time. Watch it soon after purchasing so you can return it if your copy freezes up as mine does."
3,Good price poor picture quality,"I bought this as a gift, despite warnings about the poor quality of the transfer. It is as relatively inexpensive barebones set. The picture quality is comparable to if you had transferred your old videocassetes made 20 years ago, to DVD. Some episodes have color lines running through them. All episodes are grainy. And there are various other video flaws. Furthermore, the audio is poor - lots of extraneous noise, sometimes a sound like a movie projector running, etc. If you want a cheap complete Upstairs Downstairs with the complete Thomas and Sarah, for cheap, regardless of picture quality, this is worth it. I just find it a bit depressing that any company would issue programming of such unbalanced quality."
5,Catching up on GREAT television!,"Since enjoying the second season of Downton Abbey, I chose to order the 40th Anniversary Collection of Upstairs, Downstairs. I have especially enjoyed this ""first"" series of the lives of the aristocracy and the people of service to them in the late 19th and early 20th century England very much. The characters seem ""real"", sympathetic, and of various personalities giving credence to the story line. I regret not having seen the original series of 5 seasons, however, it is so much fun to watch 3 or 4 episodes at one sitting. I highly recommend this series of PBS dramas."
5,A Series Unlike Any Other,"Upstairs, Downstairs is a show that is completely unique, compelling and addictive. Even being over 30 years old, it is still as good today as it was then. It is also extremely accurate in the logistics and history of the time period the show is set in.Given the age of the show and technical issues of the time, the DVD quality is good. There was a strike in Britain at the time causing several episodes to be shot in black and white. Those episodes did not air in the US during the show's original run as PBS only wanted to air color episodes. As a result, a second, slightly different version of the pilot episode (originally in black and white) was reshot in color specifically for PBS. The original black and white episodes that were omitted were later aired on PBS in the late 80s as ""lost episodes."""
5,Classic Show,An interesting look into the British class system and how each class deals with particular social and political issues. I'm a fan of British period dramas and this series does not disappoint.
4,Must see,"I got this for my mom, after she had mentioned it on the way to her chemo therapy treatment. I did not plan on really watching it, or expecting myself to be drawn in, but I was. I was so drawn in I had to get a copy for myself. Great stories, amazing acting, and really timeless lessons. It can be really be watched by the whole family."
2,Excellent series - Outrageously bad DVD transfer,"The series is a gem. Believe every positive review about it. It is television at its best. The only outrage is the poor quality of the transfer on the A&E set released in the US and Canada. The picture, colours, sound are awful. I bought the set and returned it. I saw the United Kingdom release, Region 2 encoded, and it is much better. You can get an idea of the difference in picture and colour quality on the Upstairs Downstairs web site, video availability page at http://www.updown.org.uk/vidtab.htm. A&E should be ashamed to give this excellent series such a bad treatment and charge over $300 for the insult."
1,Great Show - Horrible DVDs,"Before buying this set I would strongly encourage you to use a web search tool for '""Upstairs, Downstairs"" US DVD' and see for yourself just how bad the picture is on these DVDs. I can confirm that these DVDs are identical to the first US release of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", but simply repackaged and repriced lower. I own over 400 DVDs, have rented many more than that, and have never seen a worse transfer to DVD. If you must own this show on DVD buy a region-free DVD player and get one of the European sets. Not deserving of 1 star, but rather a square. Shameful. Avoid."
1,SO SAD!,"The series was most enjoyable but the quality of the DVDs was very poor. I was very disappointed, it caused me to miss large segments of the story. Wish it could be returned!"
5,Loved every minute!,I just finsished watching my last episode and am in withdrawal! I just didn't want it to end. I only wish they had done an episode where they followed up on all of the characters.Such a wonderful peephole into another way of life. I am so glad I ignored the comments that ther were problems with the video quality- I didn't notice any so I really can't imagine what they were talking about.
4,Image Quality,"Yes I have read all the reviews concerning the low quality ""fuzzy"" picture of this DVD set. I have found the remedy...just wear 3-D glasses!! Watch Hudson pop out of the screen...it's incredible!!"
1,Upstairs/Downstairs subtitles don't work,"I was so excited to get this anniversary edition at a good price. The first set arrived and the subtitles did NOT work. I returned and received another set very quickly. Amazon's exchange/return process is very efficient. Unfortunately, the second set's subtitles did NOT work. I've sent this set back as a defective product and expect a 100% refund. Are any of you having the same issue with the subtitles? I order from Amazon all of the time and this is the first time that I have been disappointed."
1,"""Upstairs,Downstairs"" boxed set","The new shrink wrappped dvd boxed set arrived very promptly. Unfortunately, one of the disks was defective.Disc # 21 was the same as dic # 22.This was not the sellers fault however. I am receiving my money back."
1,Upsatirs Downstairs has not arrived yet,I don't hate it! I want it very badly and hope that whatever is holding it up will work itelf out.
2,Interesting but useless,"The book is not entirely without merit, but it's swarming with errors. Don't use the samples of code: some of them work improperly or not at all. If you are a professional and are willing to spend hours hunting for errors, use it at your own risk. Otherwise, forget it."
2,Riddled with Errors,"This book is terrible if you are a college student trying to learn ther topics it coversThere are so many errors you don't know if what you are reading is accurate. I use it for one of my classes, and I am afraid to use it to study with"
5,The View From Pompey's Head Musical Score,I am so glad to find the beautiful musical score for The View From Pompey's Head available on cd! I highly recommend this cd.
2,Did He or Didn't He?,"A young girl who wants to marry a Reverend's son insists that her father wasn't a murderer. But Wexford is sure that the right man had hanged for the crime, and he should know because it had been his first murder case...Ruth Rendell is generally a fairly reliably entertaining writer and my low rating is really an exception. The trouble for me was that the ending was extremely obvious from a very early point-- unfortunately I read the rest of the book with a growing sense of disappointment that the answer to the mystery took the easy way out. Skip this one."
5,Just Marvelous,"I originally saw articles on Hav Plenty, but never saw the movie in the theatre. After renting the movie for the first time, I fell in love with all the characters. Christopher Cherot was awesome in sharing his experiences and with his acting debut in the film. It's one of those movies where the characters remind you of yourself or people you know. I was greatful to see people of color portrayed in a normal light. I love love stories and this one was spectacular, even after seeing a for the 15th time!"
5,I Heart this move!!!,"It's 2008 and I still love this MOVIE!!!!!The characters are complex and you can relate to something in each and everyone of them.I have watched this movie countless times and I'm so glad to see I can buy it from Amazon. The rental stores could never keep a copy. Folks kept stealing them. I know why, its THAT GOOD.Loves it!!!"
3,O.k.,"I seen this movie a long time ago and had mixed emotions. It is O.k. I did not like the Havelent (?) character. I don't like when Black Sisters are played in a mean and ignorant light. (Give a brother a nice hello or smile) I hated that he got her in the end. There were some scenes I liked, such as when the husband punched the Plenty character (funny) and the arrogance of the Hil Harper character. Babyface and is wife Tracey, Oh there acting skills were awful. However I am happy they produced the movie. This movie gets a 3 stars."
1,"lousy,corny and boring","First of all what was?No,excuse me. Who made this movie?I know Babyface had something to do with it. This movie stinks! Its about a homeless guy who for whatever reason keeps talking to these fancy bugee type women I know he was writer and he said something about being a substitute teacher. and he lived out of his car . This guy looks terrible so why would these women who already think of themselves so highly want to seduce him and he also refuses them. I dont want to go on explaining this movie or trying to understand it. Because I am trying to understand why would someone make a movie so poor and unrealistic. I figure mostly black women would view this movie I suggest stick to watching Soul Food on Showtime because this movie is the worst."
1,Hav Plenty,"This is one of the top 10 WORST movies ever made. I was so disappointed, as were the 4 other people who watched it with me. It plots was weak, as were the characters and the actors. I literally could not give the tape away, so I left it in my doctor's waiting room."
1,Not for everyone,"Am I missing something?I can't express how disappointed I was with this movie. I had a very hard time relating to these characters. In addition, the plot dealt with issues that I'm not familiar with, and at times the dialogue was difficult to understand. And don't get me started about the spelling of the title.""Hav Plenty"" didn't quite ""Hav Enough"" to make me recommend this movie to anyone."
4,"Unexpected, entertaining, hilarioius and fresh","I didn't know what to expect when I rented this movie, from the public library of all places. I laughed so hard that tears were rolling down my eyes. Chris Cherot's wit is sharp and on target. Although I am considerably older than the characters (twenty-somethings), it brought me back to my post-college days when we played romance as if it were a game and it hurt so much that you had to laugh all of the time just to keep from crying. This movie makes the point that it is hard to admit you love someone when you are almost positive that it won't be reciprocated and it does it with great intelligence and humor."
3,alright!,"When I first seen this movie over a decade ago the mood in the theater was cold, but some how the movie kept your interest, the acting was good,the plot well it was about him writing a book about the movie you are watching which isn't that sharp but kinda funny the whole thing reminds me of seinfeld a show about nothing. And I'm a big fan of the show. all & all check it out for yourself"
5,this movie is clever and funny.,"The movie was different. chris cherot's approach is unique. his leading lady did'nt do as good a job as he did. overall, the story was heartwarmig. it seems that his meassage at the end of the movie is that he does'nt have all he want's. maybe in reality he want's the son he's never spent time with in real life."
1,"NOT ""ALL THAT""...","I read previous reviews on this movie and thought tht it would be pretty funny, but after i bought it and watched it i felt like i wasted my money!!! It was Blah!!, all the way through nothing catchy or memorable about it!I'd suggest renting it but don't buy it!!"
2,20 years ago it might have been a good book,"This book might be helpful for very beginning swimmers to get started by learning about how to move in the water. But if you feel already confident holding yourself at the surface, I would not recommend buying this book. It teaches outdated technique, which makes your swimming unnecessarily slow and power-consuming. When I learned to swim 15 years ago the techniques and drills she teaches were already outdated, especially in the freestyle! The section on the turns are well written, but compared to recent articles in magazines like ""Swimmer"" the explanations are too complicated and confusing. Spend your money on books and videos by Emmett Hines or Terry Laughlin, it well get you the most rewarding experience."
2,Amateaur Hour,"Amateur is sometimes meant to be a compliment, but that is not this reviewer's intention. The subject matter here, Iran, demands a point, otherwise, this would be a 1. This ""novel"" reads like an early draft and any editor with her salt would have sent the author back to try 3 more times to get the characters to resemble humans and not convenient mouthpieces to give readers information. I have a 100 page rule with thrillers: if it isn't happenning for you in those 100 pages, it isn't going to happen, so you have the right to put it down and begin another book.I put this down at Page 98. good title, good subject, good timing for subject, poor execution: slap on wrist for editor, if there was one."
2,spy should go back to the cold,"Journalists rarely make good novelists. Neither do spies if they think their material is intrinsically interesting enough to stand by itself. This effort consists of amateurishly written dialogue and leaden story line. Remarkably the author has managed to make a fascinating subject, the Iranian revolution, as boring as reading a telephone directory."
2,The Peregrine doesn't get off the ground,"Wow. This wasn't what I expected, after reading most of the other reviews, as well as the laudatory blurbs from folks who should know a good book when they read it. I only made it through a few dozen pages of leaden dialogue among various civil servants before this book went in the charity pile."
5,More than a good spy novel,"This is a spy novel so good that it transcends the genre, the way Scott Turow transcends the legal thriller genre. The writing is superb, the observations and ironies are sublime, and the characters - American, Iranian, and Russian - spring to life with very realistic dialog and subtle depth. The setting is Iran during the transition from the Shah to the Ayatollah, which is very timely considering the transition occurring in Iraq right now. This is not a comic-book, James Bond style spy story, but a very realistic portrayal of how ""spies"" and intelligence gathering really work. It's especially revealing if you want to understand how the U.S. intelligence community can get it so wrong, even when their agents get it right."
3,Get the Complete Guide to Rock Climbing Instead,"The complete Guide to Rock Climbing (Malcolm Creasey) contains everything in this guide (identical pages) and more, and for the small additional price is worth getting instead."
3,Mixed Bag of Older Stuff,"As a huge Ozric Tentacles fan, I really wanted to like this reissue of older material. Unfortunately, while There is Nothing is interesting, it offers little that is not done better elsewhere. Live Etheral Cereal, on the other hand, is simply awful. Ozric Tentacles live is an incredible show and this collection from several different live performances does absolutely nothing to reflect that. Most of them feature the band in a selfindulgent doodling mode that is extremely tedious and ultimately just plain boring. This one is for fans and completists only."
2,Not the best,"I love the Tentacles, but these CD's of old material are lacking the insiration and technicality of the ""Erpland"" and newer CD's."
5,profound life changing healing,how toxic self sabotaging attitudes cause disease and how to heal.priceless information not readily available.
1,3rd edition renders earlier versions obsolete,"Now that the 3rd edition has been ""Fully Updated, Revised, and Expanded,"" caveat emptor---let the buyer beware---about buying an outdated publication."
3,Less inspired than their previous efforts,"After the landmark albums ""Die Kleinen und die Bösen"" and ""Alles ist gut"", the release of ""Gold und Liebe"" was followed with little interest, since there were no surprises: this album is a poppier follow-up to ""Alles ist gut"" (the structure is almost the same), sacrifying their dangerous aura in favour of a more hedonistic form of pleasure. Their sound has a little bit more of colour, but it is much easier to find sequences or texts alike to other from their previous albums. Nicer but also showing some void."
2,"Oh, my God! What happened with Henry James!!!!!!","Frankly, my dear, this is a disappointed adaptation of Henry James superb novel. I can't forget ""The Heiress"", starring the incredible Olivia de Havilland. Jennifer Jason Leigh, one of the finest actresses of her generation, it is not the best selection for Catherine Sloper role. And Agnieszca Holland don't understand any word about the old New Yorkers."
1,The film may be fine but the dvd's a dud,"This dvd cannot be played unless one installs the player software that it contains...I found the resultant program tedious and invasive...and after 20 minutes or so, threw the dvd away. The film, I've little doubt is as good as others here say - but it has been betrayed by its engineers. Go for the VHS."
2,dull,"this is a pretty dull story about jilted love. the film is based on a henry james book and it shows. james was famous for his 'realism' and 'psychological depth', qualities that he criticized an older dickens for lacking. but this movie shows what james himself lacked that dickens had in spades: ability to tell interesting stories. yeah, the characters are 'real'. but they're dull. yeah, the story is 'realistic', but it's boring. the best thing about this film is the camera work, especially the long establishing shot. that was very good! the rest of the film i can leave. oh, and jjl looks awful in this pic! god, she looks every bit in her 40's. i thought ben chaplin was making love to his mother. ugh.i'm not surprised none of james' books were named in that list of '100 greatest books of all time'. if nothing else, a film should make you want to read the book. after watching this, i'm not exactly running to my local library to get a copy."
1,"If you have any discerning taste, SKIP this one","I'll admit that usually I'm not a big fan of ""period pieces"", but this one takes the cake. This was SO boring. No, I didn't read the Henry James novel; perhaps the book is good. This movie wasn't. There are some other ""period pieces"" (i.e. Wings of the Dove, Shakespeare in Love) that I have liked, but I simply couldn't get involved in this ""I love him / all he wants is your inheritance"" tedium."
2,I kept waiting for something (anything) to happen!,"Extremely dull and boring adaptation of the Novel. Very poor casting for Catherine. The remaining actors did seem to fit their roles. The costuming and settings were very good to excellent. However the premise and theme of ""He only wants you for your inheritance"", was so repetitious that it made it hard to stomach the full two hours."
4,ery. Good but could have been slightly better....,"I watched this and like it and I bought it but it's not what I call a classic, still it's quite good adapatation of the novel. If you're a fan of the story, I recommend you try to get your hands on the play adaptation of this story ""The Heiress"" with Montgomery Cliff and Olivia DeHaviland playing the 'ugly duckling.' The story and acting is far surpassed by Washington Square.. it is currently not available on DVD but if you watch TCM you might catch it. It's a 5 starrer. (if that's a word.)"
1,"Very boring compared to the original move entitled ""The Heiress""","Washington Square is a remake of the 1949 excellent film entitled, ""The Heiress"" in which Olivai De havilland won the Oscar for Olivia De Havilland for her portrayal of Catherine Sloper, the ""plain Jane"" who fell in love with the handsome Morris Townsend, played by Montgomery Clift.The first mistake in making Washington Square, which by the way is the the original title of the book by Henry James, was in casting Jennifer Jason Leigh. Of all the actors that could have been chosen, I couldn't understand how they picked her. I like Jennifer as an actress, but not in this movie.If you want to see an academy winning performance, see ""The Heiress."""
4,Great Movie but Sad,I've seen a few versions of this movie. I like the movie but it is a sad moive. Jsaon Leigh did an execllent job protraying the leading lady. I love this version more than any that I have seen.
4,father daughter conflict,"The movie is entertaining and the acting is above par, the disillusionment of the girl on her first love is real and of course does not make it a happy ending, so if you are into a love story, forget it, but if you are into good emotional acting go for it. As always, Albert Finney is first class, Ben Chaplin as well as Maggie Smith and Jennifer Jason Leigh play admirably together. A classic!"
2,wonderful film,"Washington Square, directed by Agnieszka Holland, is a wonderful film! It is definitely better than the previous film version Heiress in 1940s. This fascinating film is a little different from its original, Henry James's Washington Square. But that doesn't matter much. It has its own merits and attractions."
1,Shockingly disappointing,"This is a bad, poorly acted and very disappointing interpretation of ""Washington Square"". If you like Henry James and want to know ""Washington Square"", read the book. If you've read it before, read it again, but whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on this dismal interpretation of a brilliant novel. I'm not going to waste your time or mine on going into details, but believe me, this is about as far from the spirit of ""Washington Square"" as anyone can get.The only good feature of the film is the set and shots for Washington Square and Washington Place in New York. They create the mood nicely."
2,Mediocre,"I guess this version as opposed to ""The Heiress"" with Olivia de Havilland, Montgomery Clift, Miriam Hopkins and Ralph Richardson, is closer to the book. However, this movie lacks passion and I'm not talking about sex. The acting is sterile. There isn't any chemistry between Jennifer Jason Leigh and Ben Chaplin. And Jennifer Jason Leigh as Catherine is so lifeless and dull. The characters in this film were so underdeveloped and bland. I just don't think that the casting worked.The best thing in this movie was the music. Especially the song Tu Chiami Una Vita ."
5,Supplements,I have been a long term customer of garlic pills to keep my blood pressure in check. This product taken on a daily basis has been the most effective for me.
3,Focussing on Lie doesn't make on Honest,"My 3 year old doesn't know what ""lie"" means, so when she does lie, she's just trying say the ""right thing."" I think this book is fine for children whom you know have blatantly lied and feel bad about it. Otherwise, younger kids may just think that Lie is a monster and he's actually not all that scary or ugly."
1,A Big Fat Enormous Lie,"Oh! The title and all the reviews sounded so good - so I bought the book for my homeschool children ages 4yrs, 5yrs and 6yrs old. Well we received the book at lunch time and got all pumped up to read it after lunch. We started to read it and all was going just fine untill we found the word ""Dumb"". If you do not want your children using the word ""Dumb"" dont buy this book. I wish the author could have used a different way to express that then I would have given this book a 5 star. I changed the lines a bit and we moved on. I will be looking for a different book on children and Lies."
1,Not so subtle manipulation,"The main flaw with this book is that it tries to scare children into telling the truth. We tell the truth because it is commanded by God not because a monster will grow big and follow us around until we fess-up. I didn't have an issue with the monster's weight like another reviewer did, however, I too threw this dribble into the trash."
3,Dark gray - not black,"Don't let the picture fool you. These pants aren't actually black; they're dark gray. I don't mean dark enough gray to be almost black either... I mean compared to my black jeans that are faded because they're 10 years old and have been washed hundreds of times, these are still lighter. Other than that though, I suppose they're fine. The front pockets are a little snug to get my hands into, but that's a pretty minor gripe."
3,"HAWKWIND-'Weird Tape,Volume 3' (Voiceprint)","The second coolest cover of the Weird Tape series.Put on your dancing shoes - five more tunes from a live 1977 gig.However,this time it's from the historic Stonehenge Festival.This is probably the first time most of us have heard good quality live '77 recorded material from the band.I liked the entire festival snippet,""High Rise"",""Damnation Alley"",the superb version of ""Robot"" and the total ass-kicking ""Uncle Sam's on Mars""(one of Bob Calvert's best ever songs).Plus,there are two tracks from a live 1975 festival at the Watchfield are added,which are decent.""Circles"" and the familiar sounding ""I Am The Eye""."
1,I hate to destroy a book...,"but I had to with this. I didn't want such a horrible book to fall into someone elses hands and them getting delusions of Japanese fighting. The authors martial background is questionable. He claims he is/was the only one taught some super secret Ninja sword fighting technique from a Ninja master because he saved his life. The book is poorly written, has alot of questionable material, bad visuals and just plain awful. I agree with the others, this book wastes shelf space and deserves to be destroyed."
3,pretty good..not as cool as the head trip,"the head trip is definitely more of a ""trip"" than this but its still cool. if you liked the head trip you might like this but it doesn't do nearly as much weird nerve stimulation as the head trip."
2,Not what I expected.,"After using for a while, it's been difficult to get the wires to bed to just the right position. Also, you can't appy too much force or the wires will bend."
2,Not very good,"This seems to be a low-quality product, and it doesn't really do a good job of back scratching. In the 1950s, my grandmother got a plastic back scratcher that was better and sharper, and it just broke last year! Look for a different model or get someone to scratch your back for you."
4,Good back scratcher and tickler,"Really like this item, the prongs could be a little stronger, maybe if they were shorter that would stiffen them up a little and then make the handle longer to reach the back. It's great when someone uses it on you! It's tickling without getting any skin under your nails!"
4,"A Strong, albeit short, Read","Although proofreading for grammatical and spelling errors was lacking( as mentioned in another review,) it did not detract from my overall enjoyment of this novel. The fight sequences were well written and dynamic, as one would expect from the author's martial arts expertise. I have loaned this book out to 4 of my friends who have martial arts backrounds. All of them give this quick, but enjoyable read, 4 stars. I concur."
2,A bad read!,"If you like martial arts fiction with good characters, dialouge, and plot then this is not the book for you. The idea of a martial arts tournament has been done to death. Not to mention that most of the characters are a cliche. Some of the fight scenes are ok, but that's about the best thing I can say about it."
4,"Authentic, tight work",Mr. Dearing has written and enthralling suspenseful story set in the martial arts world. He uses his knowledge of the martial arts to lend authenticity to his characters and settings and the story moves quickly to a satisfying conclusion. Jesse Standard is an intelligent likable character who uses as much brain as he does brawn to guide him in his encounters.
5,architecture of the simplicity and depth in which the book,"Simplicity. Depth. And heavier. Without flashy, fashion does not follow, seriously think the image of an architect to work, drawings, etc. that most faithfully reflects the book is shown."
4,great camera for beginers,"considering the price this camera works great, I use it for taking family pics and is wonderful. What I dont like is the lack of zoomGreat product anyway"
5,I love this camera,My sons recently bought this camera for me as a gift. I Love It!! It is easy to use and the pictures come out great. Wonderful product for the price.
3,Battery Usage,Seems like this camera goes through batteries like I go through cigarettes. Always having to replace them.
2,"The pictures suck, plain and simple","To make a long story short, I recently switched to this camera after having a 3.2 MP Olympus Camedia camera for 3 years.I just took this camera on a camping trip and shot 80 pics. There is not a single one in the bunch that comes anywhere close to the clarity and rich color that my old camera delivered. The level of graininess is astoundingly bad.I'm probably going to sell this thing within the next 2 weeks and go back to my Olympus."
2,Surprised by the good reviews! Don't get this camera!,"I was given this camera as a gift a couple months ago - and I'm currently trying to decide how to tactfully tell my parents & in-laws that I'll be buying a new digital camera soon.I have taken pictures in all types of lighting, with all but one of the pre-set functions, and I have been disappointed over and over again. Luckily, I'm handy with Photoshop and can fix the color relatively well... the sharpness of the photos though - that's another issue.Problems: Color quality is not very good (especially shadows... they look green or red tinged!). Also, for a 7 MP camera, the images are NOT as sharp and crisp as one would expect. My old 4 MP camera has much better quality photos! And it has no viewfinder for sunny days when you can see the screen!Word to the wise, skip this camera and buy something else."
4,Sony Cybershot,It is great for the price. I didn't want anything fancy since I was in Iraq. I was disappointed that it didn't use the same memory card as the older model. It is ben reliable and takes good pictures.
5,Sony cybershot camera,Love the camera. The price was great and reasonable. Camera was overall in very good shape. Can't complain with it.Thanks....
5,Sony Cybershot S650 7.2MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom,uch I liked the camera excellent for trips and tours to and very good capaidad resolution for photos and videos
1,Waste,CONSbad lightingno image stabilizationblurry grainy picssucks up batteriesbad indoorscant see screen @ night or near beachPROgood for startersbets a disposable cameraBTW currently shopping for another one
4,"Great Camera, more for the price","I bought this camera becuase it was a great camera and not too expensive. I'm happy with it for the most part. great pictures and video. Not too many effects on it though and i still haven't figured out how to make the pictures black and white. It's not a really simple camera...but besides all of that, the thing I didn't like about it is that you can't zoom while videotaping. Why in the world would you make a camera that dosen't zoom?? I can't figure it out. but whatever. it's a cool camera!"
1,Not a sony fan,Pictures were printed fuzzy on every setting I tried. They looked pretty good on the monitor but when I got my prints back from kodak gallery I wasn't a happy camper.I thought since it was a 7.2 MP that it would be better than my Canon 3.2 but I was wrong. Also the rinky dink memory card is a PIA. You might want to think twice when it comes to a Sony cybershot. I am going to buy a Canon again.
2,"Cheap camera, but you can ask for a better camera at this price","This camera is kind of cheap, but you can ask for a better camera at this price, the biggest down side is the battery life, because this camera uses AA batteries and those wont last very long, every thing else looks plain and simple nothing high tech, my advice if you like it is: get the Sony w55 thats a very good camera and is not so much more money than this one"
3,slightly disappointed,"I bought this camera about two and a half weeks ago because I was looking for something more compact than the one I have. One of my favorite features of digital cameras is the video recording and playback. What I didn't realize (and found to be misleading) is that the sound is only audible when played back on TV or computer. When it says ""record with sound"" I (naively?) assumed that it meant on playback. Unfortunately, it is 3 days past the return date at Best Buy or I would take it back. Looks like I might try selling it here.Another disadvantage that I wasn't accustomed to with my old camera is the rate at which the Sony Cybershot sucks up battery power. I bought brand new Energizer rechargable batteries when I bought the camera and it wouldn't even accept those without being charged first- right out of the package!So in a nutshell, I'm a little disappointed."
5,Easy to use,"It didn't take me minute to figure it out. The downloads are easy without using any software. The movie taking part is a little tricky, but you can become proficient after a few sample tries."
2,Choose a different Camera!!!,"After having to replace my cannon because of being damage due to being dropped, I had wanted to get the same, but it was no longer available, so after researching and looking at reviews, I decided on the Sony cyber shot. I was immediately dissapointed. It uses regular batteries, it comes with no charger, it doesnt take standard memory cards, it is very UN-user friendly. I took it to my sons school concert to take pictures and they all came out blurry, it is very difficult to use and the quality of pictures is poor. I ended up reselling the product and went with a Casio Exilim which I am very happy with and its very easy to use with great quality pictures. Dont waste your money on the Sony,Sony has great electronics but I wouldnt say that for their cameras."
2,blurry photos,"This camera has a serious design flaw. You need to really push down on the button to shoot a picture. Because of this, the camera tends to move when you press the button, and the result is a blurry picture. I would definitely not recommend this camera."
2,A paw in the face by Hello Kitty,"If you are looking for a camera for your 10 year old kid, this is the one. Unless your kid thinks that you 'mis-underestimate' him/her.The camera has minimal features, however, if you play around with a photo software, you could get decent results. The very least Sony could have done is to enable you to screw on a lens if you wanted to, or perhaps a polarizer. But, no!"
5,Judy in concert from her CBS television series,"An absolute must for all Judy Garland fans. This video is one of the later episodes from her 1963-64 TV series. Its Judy in concert and at her best. Some very wonderful moments including Thats Entertainment, Give my Regards to Broadway, Swing low Sweet Chariot, and America the Beautiful. Judy also sings to her younger two children after she brings them on stage with her. Wonderful video."
4,You need to listen to this!,"The acoustic spirit is SO GOOD. It brings the words alive inside of you. The actual performance though is too much ""look how good I am"" in the attitude for me."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"This product does not work even when instructions are followed exactly. I prepped my laminate and counter top, waited the 30-40 minutes, the product appeared clear and slightly tacky just like the instructions say. This failed miserably. The laminate would not stick. I rubbed off the dried glue to try it a second time, sanded surfaces, cleaned surfaces, followed instructions exactly and the horrible stuff would not hold my laminate down. It states that an instant bond will form but after rolling the laminate multiple times for a matter of minutes, the laminate still will not stick. I am taking the product back. What a waste of time and money."
1,Doesn't even stick to itself...,"I don't know how I am going to get this crap off the table top and laminate. It doesn't make the laminate stick to the table - you know, the whole point of contact cement...Flour and water paste would work at least as well as this crap..."
1,Biggest Failure of a Product I Ever Used,"Run, don't walk away from this product! A total failure for gluing laminate counter top. I'd give it a zero if I could. I tried the non-flammable product since I was applying it in my basement during the winter and thought DAP was a reliable brand, so this was a safer method. Followed instructions carefully and it did not stick to anything. The only salvation for my project was that its adhesive property is so poor that I was able to peel the material off both my particle board bar top and the Formica. It took a couple hours but it peeled off in stretchy pieces that were the consistency of a condom, which DAP better be wearing when they screw the customers that buy this product. I'll be going back to Menards for the good old solvent-based contact cement."
4,definitely a buy,when i first started listenin i was like ok this is pretty good but then by the time the first track was halfway through i was considering it to be the best jazz ive heard in a long time u have to buy this one
1,Worst Henna Ever,"I've been dyeing my hair with henna for about two years now. I saw that Avigal came in burgundy and decided to give it a try.Big mistake.The henna doesn't mix well so giant globs of the stuff wind up everywhere except your hair. Trying to get your hair fully covered is nearly impossible. Worst of all, my hair came out nowhere close to burgundy. This henna took me from a nice bright red with dark blonde roots to an all-over murky chestnut brown. I'll go back to getting my henna from hennaforhair.com from now on. And if you are new to using henna, don't start with this crap. Get real henna, or if you want to go black, do a henna and indigo mix at home.Avoid this stuff like the plague."
1,Note,"I bought Discovering Egypt because the box looked interesting. Unfortunately, I found out after installing it on my system that it is NOT compatible with Windows XP. Their web site even says this (which I read after-the-fact). No update is planned by them. Please be aware of that."
4,Grest Learning Experience,I think that Discovering Egypt was a great set of discs for learning about Egypt. I learned a lot from it and it helped me out in school and in projects. I would reccomend this for the ages 10 and up.
2,"Chairs are nice, but....","Chairs are nice for the price, but if you have ANY problems with them, I as did, take care of the problem the day you receive these. AMAZON & WORLD FACTORY have TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE customer service when it comes to replacements because an item is defective. I received a chair with a leg that was snaped off and NEITHER of these two companies would replace it!!!"
5,A great book and reference,"Great book! Simple to follow and the instructions are clear. It also allows for your own creativity to design and make future pieces. The illustrations are also very attractive and as a beginner I found the designs very encouraging and achievable to work toward. I think for the advanced, this book will be a great reference as well."
3,Terrific performance from an actor you've never heard of,"Despite the title this film is not really about Jean Harlow but about a newspaper reporter played by Robert Williams, an actor who made only a handful of films (4 in 1931) before he died at age 35. This guy is a winning, natural actor with the charm and intelligence of the early Gable but without the vanity. He would have been a huge star through the 30s and 40s had he lived. Harlow is not bad and Loretta Young is beautiful and likable, but I couldn't take my eyes off Williams. Kevin Kline should remake this one and play the Williams role."
2,Mediocre Capra,"I just saw this movie because I am into watching Jean Harlow movies at the moment....her performance is OK in this film but nowhere close to the great acting she did in later MGM comedies.The thing that really surprised me was when I realized I was watching a bad Frank Capra picture.....I did not know this guy made bad pictures, but this one is no It Happpened One Night, Mr Smith Goes To Washington, Mr Deeds Does To Town, etal. In fact I was TOTALLY bored....I fast forwarded much of the rowdy party scene and was happy it ended is less that 90 minutes. Not recommended."
2,dull dull dull,"Generally I love old movies, but this one was completely flat. The plot (working guy meets society girl, gets dazzled and ignores his real love) is nothing new (and was nothing new at the time) but since I have seen this plot done at least a dozen different INTERESTING ways, that alone wouldn't bother me. It's the fact that it's a totally unfunny comedy. Nothing funny happens. Just the same old plot without any of the sparkle that makes good comedies (His Girl Friday, Libeled Lady) a joy to watch."
4,Well I liked it...,"This is the one movie I've come across that manages to bring tears to my eyes every single time I've watched it. All of the actors are absolutely amazing... except for Jean Harlow, who is terrible. The humor is subtle on occasion and might be missed by those used to the more ribald humor of today. Most of the fun of Platinum Blonde is watching Stew Smith's eyes for his reactions. One can only wonder sadly why Jean Harlow was allowed to act in this film."
1,Didn't work for me,"With all the plug adapters, I expected that this would be compatible with my Sony boombox - but none of the plugs fit the ACDC jack on the radio. Useless to me now."
2,More of a primer,While there is good information to be gleaned from this book it leaves a lot to be desired. The layout is non-existent and the structure has a stream of consciousness feel to it.While it's seems to have been spell-checked it is in need of proof-reading. Instances of the wrong word slipping through (ill rather than will is one example) and at least one case of some missing text make it a bit confusing at times.All this is even less excusable as it appears this not the first edition (though it is the first edition through this publisher.)
5,Brilliant! Improves on the original version.,"This is a really good book. It has all the characteristic's that made the original a cherished and remembered fairy tale. It is a great gift for any young child, and can be enjoyed by adults too. It maintains the feel of the original tale, but is more like a poem. The art work on each page is beautiful, and the pictures are totally devine. I would recomend buying this for a different and fully enjoyable version of the original."
3,"Shuffles well enough, but it's just LOUD!!!","Got this as a gift, and while it does shuffle well, it's just really loud! To the point where after a while, it was just distracting. The rollers spinning in the plastic shell makes a lot of noise as it grabs the cards and spits them into the middle drawer. In the end, we found that shuffling by hand wasn't all that difficult, and it was a lot quieter. More of a novelty item, really."
1,Received product but was broken,"I ordered this product and received it in timely fashion but the top door to it was broken. Otherwise, this product looks very cheap and poorly made overall. It does shuffle cards but looks like and is made like a cheap toy. Would not recommend to anyone."
1,It's suck!!!,"I got what i paid for. The cheap stuff stopped working after several times. I threw it away the next day. Save your money for something better, and for batteries as well.Anyway, delivery on time."
3,Works but is really loud,Wow this thing is loud. It does work but is really too loud for a normal game. It also doesn't work on over sized cards or cards that are in sleeves (like magic cards).
5,a great debut novel by an up and coming writer,"It takes a lot of courage to leave your family and move on by yourself. I knew a lady that did it to her children, and they were better off for it. In this instance, I felt that they just depended on Mama too darn much. And she had a right to leave so they could depend upon themselves. My hats off to the author for such a great story and read. I enjoyed it."
4,fun little book,"While the main character and the author are African American, the story is universal.Zaney characters that you quickly care about and wish for their success.A quick fun read--"
4,Great game,"... here is the review: This game has fantastic graphics and sound which does get old but still keeps you involved. The gameplay is simple enough but you can continually get better, unfortunately button mashers fare just as well too. Also the menu layout and control is freaky ..., plus black and white pictures of 3 year olds make you go ""HUH?"".All in all this is a great game that despite it's flaws makes for an extraodinary experience."
3,A VERY Addictive game,"The whole concept of this game is a bit cheesy, but very addictive. You have to collect the flares/fireworks and explode them. I have learned that the most you collect at once, creates a bigger chain. The bigger the chain, the more points you score. After figuring out how to play, you go for the chain. There are only 8 stages to the game, which I think, is too easy. I beat the game numerous times. I'm ready for more stages of the game. :) All in all, I think any kid would love this game. The graphics are great and so are the themes. I like the ""Space"" theme. Also, after you beat the game, you are able to access a movie that shows you how to build your chains. You can also play all 8 stages in the chain mode. I give this game 3 stars because it is not the greatest, but it is a lot of fun and addictive."
2,Looks better than it really is,"This game I bought used, but I'm ready to rid myself of it. The graphics are OK, but the amount of play it takes you to master this game is pathetic. I beat the game after only 10 minutes of plays and Game Overs. Even the HARD MODE wasn't, ummm, hard. The part that really got on my nerves was that you can't save your game on say, level 6, turn off the system, start it back up, and have it load your save. Even if it only saved when I got the extra options, I'd be satisfied, but it couldn't even do that. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!!!!!"
1,terrible game,"The graphics in this game are really good but thats not what a game should be rated on, it is how much fun it is. All that goes on in this game is to fire lights at airplanes and other areal objects"
4,Fun and Relaxing,"The game is quite fun. It's like a ""chill-out"" game where you can play and have fun and enjoy the cool music, graphics, and pretty fireworks :) Trying to get as many chains of fireworks as possible can be a challenge, if you choose to do so. Enjoy!"
3,Great shorts BUT terrible looking copy of it!!,"Love Our Mr. Sun and did have the Image dvd release and decided to buy this one hoping that a better print of the film was made..WRONG! This dvd has a very weak colors, print damage and poor sound. Avoid this release and buy the Our Mr.Sun / Strange Case Of The Cosmic Rays dvd release which Amazon still sells."
3,"Great sound, lots of enthusiasm","This band plays with passion. They have a great raw garage sound, but the track that does it for me is '(I'm Gonna) Kick You Out'. It's strong and it's catchy. It's a pity the rest of the album can't match it!"
2,"Disappointing, even for the money...","I bought this one and all I can say is be very careful, the cannister containing the ice cream is made of VERY thin and flimsey metal. I made a total of two complete batches before it got banged up and dented by just spinning in the ice. A big leak developed and the unit became useless. And Rival is listing replacement metal cannisters at about the cost of three new units....Buyer beware..."
3,Great Buy,I bought this as a gift and never got to use it because I found out that someone else had bought it for the recipient. I am sure it was a nice ice cream maker
3,Just So So but no much choice,"to my disappointment,the quality of the DVD is not that good,but it seems that i don't have much choice,cause Ace Of Base DVDs are rare.hope amazon will import more Ace Of Base MTVs,i will buy any of them.of cause Roxette and Ateens are also welcome."
2,"This review is for their other cd, Vestiges","Ok, i'll admit i felt slightly duped when i got all three of their cds brand new for $6. Truly it is unfair to compare them to Dropkick Murphys, Real McKenzies, or Flogging Molly. However, this isn't a terrible cd. It is like a cd by a band you would catch as an opening act for some big name punk act like Dropkick Murphys or The Mighty Mighty Bosstones or others. If you get a chance to pick up these cds for next to nothing, then go for it, they have a couple of decent songs per cd, which isn't bad for an up and coming band that could (god willing!!) actually be great (when they learn to play their instruments and write good songs). So don't discount them too fast, they have potential."
1,i can't believe they were compared to dkm,"i bought this cd on ebay because the person selling it said that it was a must for dropkick murphy fans! WRONG! dkm is so much better.. they know how to play and it sounds good. i dont even think that i made it through the cd one full time.. stick to dropkick murphys, flogging molly, and the real mckenzies if you want some real celtic punk rock!"
3,Where Eagles Dare / Operation Crossbow,"Ron Goodwin is one of my very favourite composers and the release of two of his recordings is definitely cause for celebration. These are original recordings thus the sound quality betrays its age. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended if only for what I believe is the very first release of the Operation Crossbow soundtrack. You can almost feel yourself strapped in the tiny cockpit of a V-1 manned flying bomb, or tremble at the terrible sight of the first V-2 ballistic missile liftoff. If anything, Operation Crossbow should be the subject of a new recording (Where Eagles Dare already has)."
2,A journey into loonyland,"A monk is sent to England as a scount for the future process of evangelization. Eventhough their belief system is aimed toward collision, a local shaman decides to help him in his process of discovery of religious rituals and information gathering. However, the monk is surprised by how theorical are the foundations of his faith when he is shown by the shaman that he knows little of nothing about himself, so if he wants to conquer others, the monk must seek within his true nature. It is here were the novel becomes really boring, lacking any type of tension and becoming a bunch of fairy tale stories of ghosts, waking trees, ogers, and other stuff which must surely do not come from the Bristish Museum documents but from the imagination of the author.So if you want to read fairy tale stories, the ones that offered in the children's section of the bookstore are much more fun."
5,Castaneda takes a holiday in Olde England,"A great read with serious scholarship behind it, makes the shamanic traditon fit in an English context as well as reflecting on the politics of missionary zeal"
4,Anglo-Saxon Castaneda,"Like my subject line says, I conceive this book as having been written as a response to Castaneda. The similarities are remarkable. The differences, however, are striking. Primarily, Bates has done his homework and his research is impeccable. A valuable bibliography is provided at the end of the text. Also, the protagonist is much stronger and more direct with his observations, thereby allowing the subject to be explored and completed in one volume rather than 9 (were there really that many Castaneda books?) Although its ""Saxonness"" is minimal, this is a strength of the book. It doesn't fall into a narrow perspective, but rather incorporates the most important aspects of shamanism as a whole. Recommended as a refreshingly alternative way to jar the average person out of their own ""reality"" and into that of the sorcerer."
5,"possible life-changing experience, so they say!","Like the previous reviewer from NY, I too read this book after listening to Sabbat's ""Dreamweaver"" LP. It is a dark, yet enchanting book that portrays life as it was, or could well be. Based upon lost wisdom, this book may well awaken primeval instincts, provide the reader with a connection to man's latent power....just read it and see what you feel.... a very powerful piece of literature!"
1,A product of questionable quality!,"I received the PNI V2000 as a gift in September 2002. It seemed to work fairly well until the temperature got below 30 degrees. The accuracy of the thermometer below 30 is very poor, and as it gets colder the accuracy gets worse. I exchanged the unit, and the new one was even worse. The thermometer was at least as inaccurate, and it did not display any temperatures between 9 and 15 degrees. If the thermometer did work, the fact that it doesn't register temperatures below 1 degree limits its usefullness in Vermont. The compass seems accurate most of the time but is prone to go out of adjustment and requires re-calibration fairly frequently. It would be a fun device to have in your vehicle if it worked."
1,Don't get suckered!,"It only goes down to ONE degree - will not show temps below ONE. Need I say more? It's horrible and the company, when contacted had NO explanation why their product wouldn't read the full range of temperatures to be expected in the USA."
2,PNI V2000 Deluxe Info Center,"Although the information is useful and accurate, the product is cumbersome to use for gauging external temps. You need to find a suitable place to put the sensor in order to get a ""true"" outside temp. We placed it in the door jam as a suggested placement, but found the reading to be off 10 degrees. If placed under the hood or in the grille, you would need to buy an extension cord.Also, the unit can not be left in the car during extreme heat or cold so it would require remembering to take the unit inside and back to the car in summer or winter months. To me, it was not worth the extra effort. Easier to turn on the radio and listen for the temp."
4,Great device!,"I bought the V2000 last year and it has worked great since then. The compass has always given me accurate directions and has lasted through one winter and one summer so far. I always left my V2000 in the vehicle, although the manual did state that you should take the device with you when the temperature is hot. The V2000 has visible at all situations. I can see it clearly in the dark with the V2000's automatic backlight, and see it clearly on a sunny day. Finding a good place to put the temperature probe, however, is a hassle if you want to get accurate results. Calibration was also a hassle for me. You have to be on leveled ground and make a fairly even circle in order to get accurate readings."
3,Compass review for PNI V2000,"Vehicle installation is a snap with this compass. Plug power into cigarette lighter and temp sensor for inside/outside temp (I use mine inside). Calibration is a no-brainer on this one. The backlit display for evening usage was very useful on my roadtrip from TX to WI and back. I found it to shake around a bit more than I wanted to on the trip, but perhaps the suction cups needed re-adjustment. Other than that, this unit works great. I've had mine for a few weeks now and had no problems yet. I've even used the temp probe to tell me how cold my ac is blowing! (lol) If i were to purchase something like this in the future I'd probably look for a better price. ..."
3,I have a hard time keeping it calibrated.,"Easy to install, but I don't trust the compass. I have not moved the unit, but it doesn't always read correctly, therefore requiring recalibration. I have not hooked up the thermometer yet. I couldn't find a very good spot to mount the unit, but that's not the fault of the product.My last vehicle had one in the rear view mirror, and I miss that one a great deal. I was trying to get the same attributes with this unit, but its just not the same."
3,It Works! 5 Stars,"I bought this product after seeing the reviews. At first, I couldn't get the thermo to work at the right temp. It was always 7 deg higher. Then I changed the location to the front grill and it works! However, when I am at a light or stopped, the temp then goes way up. As soon as I drive, it goes to the right temp. Does anyone have a suggestion to stabilize the temp? The compass works great, though. I tried to move it closer to me - on the dashboard not on the windshield - and it wouldn't work. It said ""distortion"". So I moved it back and everything is OK. I have not installed the hard wire yet. Battery seems good enough. AHA! I have found that if you put it behind the front license plate with styrofoam over it, it works fine for the outside temperature. So I change to 5 stars!"
3,PNI Viewfinder,"The compass is very accurate and works great most of the time. The only small problem Iv'e experienced is the need to re-set the compass about 2 to 3 times per month. Also the temp. reading is not very accurate even by placing in the door jamb as stated in instructions. Buy this for the compass and you should be happy, not for the temperature readings, mine are almost always off about 10 degrees."
1,Deffective Temp Senor Plug in Wire,Please advise me if I can get a new Plu in senor Temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work? Please advise ASAPThanksWalter Gay
1,does not work,The first one I bought started going crazy within a day. The ecreen showed unintelligible symbols and the like. EVentually I could not even power it on. I was told by PNI Global to take out battery and let in sit for 12 hours. Did that then it started breaking down again. The temp sensor did not work because anywhere I placed it it was affected by other sources of heat or cold. They sent me another one which did the same thing. Now I have sent my second one back and they are going to test it and probably send me another one (my third!!!). The good news is that they are nice in customer service.
1,Don't buy this! I Mean it!,"I bought this about 2 weeks ago. I would have loved it except for 2 things.The most disappointing thing is, this thing will not stay on the windshield. it comes as two parts one part will go on the glass and it will connect to the main unit. the connection looks advanced. but it doesn't work. I really mean it. as soon as you enter the freeway it will start flying. my all time record that it stayed on the windshield is 2 minutes.The other thing is after a day of calibrating the unit it will show completely the wrong direction. if you don't mind picking it up every second and calibrating it everyday, you should consider buying this - it's a great gadget unless otherwise...."
4,"so far, so good",Got the item on time. Cost was good. So far it works well. No complaints and would buy from this company again.
2,Braudy Misled Like Many Others,"Not too many years ago the killer of Sal Mineo was caught. He had been pulled in for another crime, his girlfried had also been interviewed by police and told the police the story her boyfriend, the killer, told her. He corrorborated it in a written confession shortly therafter. Mr. Mineo was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was killed by a small time thug. The murder had NOTHING to do with his lifestyle.I am aghast at the slander of the murder victim I have heard over the years, and if you are one of the defilers, I hope you ask your God for forgiveness. It seems his gayness nudged people into a viciousness of conjecture that might not have been if Mr. Mineo were straight. At any rate, it would be nice to see Ms. Baudy publish or at least verbalize an apology, instead of standing behind this repulsive scenario she entirely cooked up in her head."
3,Love songs from a talented seventeen year old,"These Canzonette are Monteverdi's earliest secular works. His previous two collections having been church music; the Sacrae cantiunculae for 3 voices of 1582, and the Madrigali spirituali a 4 of 1583. These are lightweight works, as you would expect, but not childish by any means. Monteverdi is already showing artful word play, and the thin booklet gives a few examples. What it doesn't give, which is unforgiveable, is texts - although the canzonette are by minor poets the words are still the whole point here, and the listener's Italian will need to be pretty fluent to pick up what the composer is saying in the interplay between lyric and music. As a consolation this CD is packed to the limit; Playing time 78'01."
5,"GREAT SERIES, worth every penny","Ok, so I bought this about two months ago for around $35... so I don't know why the price has gone up but it is a great boxed set and woth every penny. It even includes the two most recent episodes/movies, that netflix doesn't have (although they are the weakest of the series). The story pulls you in and entertains both young and old.Also, if you haven't seen it yet check out your local library."
5,Best British Series Ever!!!,"There are 8 Horatio Hornblower movies altogether and I thoroughly enjoyed them from start to finish. The actors are all superb, characters so believable, costumes so beautiful and stories so exciting and full of naval adventures to keep you entertained over and over again.The saddest thing is that the series has ended prematurely and I hope that someday somehow this excellent British series will be revived again for all of us Hornblower fans worldwide.What more can I say, the Hornblower saga is that captivating and I cannot wait to resume watching more new and daring adventures of this fascinating hero and his loyal men.This is entertainment at its best and we want more. Please bring back Horatio Hornlower!!!!!"
3,Wonderful series poor DVD quality,"I LOVE this series it is a well made well acted book to TV series. However, my complaint is with the qulaity of the DVDs. Some of them play just fine but three of them will not play in any DVD player or on our computers dvd drive. We have had three DVD players (all new) since we bought the DVDs and they always freeze up a few minutes (always in the same place) into the movie. There are no scratches or marks on the DVDs so Im not sure what is wrong. I hope that they were just from a bad batch and this will not be a problem for anyone else. Despite the flaws I would still urge anyone to purchase and enjoy this wonderful series!"
5,This is a very good series. It is very enjoyable to watch.,"Like most A & E series this is excellent. Great acting, very well written, and fun to watch. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Hornblower Video Collection,"This is an excellent value with 8 full length movies. And everyone of them is very well done. A must for anyone interested in the original book series, as well as being enjoyable in their own right for those who have not read the books but are interested in the period."
4,closed captioning/ picture/ sound,"Very enjoyable series of 8 A&E tv movies, with excellent picture quality, and Dolby Digital Stereo sound. Only the last 2 movies are in wide-screen. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars are the lack of subtitles on titles 4-8 (1-4 are subtitled). It's nice to have subtitles when characters speak with accents (to us Yanks), especially during very noisy storm or battle scenes."
5,Great fun!,"Hornblower is the most fun we've had in a long while. Plus you learn all kinds of things you didn't know before. We saw part of it at our parents' house, came home and had to buy it. Now we have loaned it to our son and his wife. This is a great show for all adults!"
5,Brilliant in all respects,"One of the very finest series I have ever seen. Ranks in quality with Upstairs Downstairs. Outstanding acting, superb photography. Not a dull moment in all 8 episodes. HIGHLY REOMMENDED."
5,Hornblower,This is an epic presentation. It provides good interaction between the classes in the British Navy with historical information and good visuals. Lots of action and intrigue.
5,Horatio Hornblower Collection,"I really enjoyed watching this series and enjoyed a hero with the qualities of bravery, loyalty,kindness, decisiveness,leadership ability, and overall good moral charachter. Too bad there aren't enough people in real life with Hornblower's qualities."
5,Fantastic,"This series is absolutely marvelous. We watched one a night and a couple of weeks later started the series over again with friends. My husband said after wards he was surprised, he did not think I would enjoy it. Talk about excitement."
5,Hornblower Rocks,"I waited years to see the Horation Hornblower series, not thinking myself a swashbuckler fan. After watching Amazing Grace six times at the theatre I decided I needed a little more Ioan Gruffudd in my life (Fantastic Four hardly counts) so I sprang for it. This is possibly the greatest dramatic achievement I've ever been privy to; I'll rate it up there with the complete Lord of the Rings, and know of no other comparisons. Outstanding Brit cast and flawless productions; completely engrossing tales. My only beef is that they stopped at eight films: there should be 12 or 16 ..."
5,An Unforgettable Series!,"The Horatio Hornblower series, based on the fabulous books by C.S. Forester, carries on the Hollywood tradition of swashbuckling tales and high adventure on the seas. The series traces the seafaring career of Horatio Hornblower as he develops into a fine officer of His Majesty's Royal Navy.Ioan Gruffudd gives consistently excellent performances as the dashing and heroic Horatio. He is supported by an amazing cast of equally talented actors such as Robert Lindsay, David Warner, Paul McGann, Jamie Bamber, Paul Copley, and many others.The made-for-television movie features well-constructed storylines. From the wonderful three-masted sailing ships to the attention to details, the filming of this series is outstanding.For an adventurous romp on the high seas, this wonderfully entertaining series will leave you yearning for more."
5,Horatio Hornblower Collector's Edition,"Excellent collection of the eight feature-length episodes dramatizing the adventures of C. Forrester's honorable Horatio Hornblower. We get to see him go through the trials, tribulations, and triumphs as he passes the ranks from midshipman to lieutenant to commander and eventually captain of his own ship. Full of amazing period scenery and acting plus the thrilling battles with the French and Spanish and a little romance on the side... this is sure to be a frequent replay on your DVD player."
2,Little relation to the novels,It is open to question if the writers ever read the original novels or simply believed they could do better. They were mistaken.Neither particularly good drama nor a faithful rendering of the classic books. Take a pass and go see Peck's Movie.
5,Fabulous,My husband didn't want to watch these since he preferred the Gregory Peck version. He LOVED them and every so often says we need to see where Hornblower is in the world. Sure wish they could add to the series.
5,Best Hornblower bang for the buck,"First of all, the entire production series is wonderfully done from screenwriting, to sets, to actors and direction. There are many more reviews that already speak volumes to the superb production of this series.I will focus on this 8-volume set and its value. I already own the first 4 volumes purchased in one set years ago. I decided to purchase this full 8-volume set, even though it duplicates my original set, since purchasing volumes 5 through 8 in their respective 2-volume collections was much more expensive, and now I can even resell my original set of volumes 1-4 if I choose, thus reducing my total expenditure. The packaging for 8-volume set works wonderfully and all of the special features from volumes 1 through 4 are still there.Great buy!"
5,Outstanding series!,"This is a fabulous series celebrating honor, moral courage, difficult decisions, and other wonderful virtues that seem to be seriously lacking in today's media viewing options. Horatio Hornblower takes each challenge handed him in his British naval career and does the right thing, even when it is hard. I call this a ""manly"" movie, but I have loved watching it as well!"
5,We were sorry there were only 8 DVDs,"I got this series for my husband a couple of years ago, but we put off seeing it since we hadn't read all the books. We finally decided a couple of months ago to watch it anyway. We loved it!! After we finished the series we loaned it to our son and his wife and they loved it, too. We ordered it for my husband's father for Father's Day early and he loves it. Our son and his wife ordered it for her dad for his birthday and he and his wife stayed up till 2:00 am watching it. Really we enjoyed these DVDs more than most of the movies we've seen in the theatre lately (actually I'm not sure if we liked any better)."
5,Horatio Hornblower Collector's Edition,"I love Ioan Gruffudd!!! This is an awesome series with great, historical stories and plot lines. The dialogue is also witty. I love almost all A&E and BBC productions and this one beat my expectations."
5,5 Stars for Hornblower,If there was ever a man soap opera this is it! The series is fantastic. These stories just suck you in and its very hard to not want to watch all of them back to back. Ioan Gruffudd is an excellent actor who definitely carries this series. I am not a big time television guru but this is a must have series if you enjoy movies about the old British Navy and swashbuckling etc.
5,Best television series ever made,"I just finished watching this through a second time, about 7 years after I originally watched it on British Television. What a series! The cast are incredible, so many great characters that you'll love. The action is great, the sets (including the ships) are outstanding and the stories are unmatchable. A truely amazing series with so many impressive cast members that I have to mention them again. Ioan Gruffudd and Robert Lindsey couldn't be bested by anyone in the world, and the supporting cast (Stiles, Matthews and many many more of Hornblower's fellow crew members) are equally brilliant.The only downside of this series is how abruptly it ends. Bring back Hornblower!"
3,"If you want to see how people lived on a British warship during Napoleonic War, this tv series is for you.","If you want to see how people lived on a British warship during Napoleonic war, this tv series is for you. The acting is average. There are a lot of twists. The costumes look authentic. The boats, especially French boats are not shown in details, just briefly. It's the same for the fighting scenes. They're very short. Most of the times, only things on the British sides are depicted not on the French side. The hand-to-hand fighting is left much to be desired. All these exposes the small budget of the movie.It's a drama but somehow it does not appeal to me. It's still worth renting for curiosity."
3,horatio hornblower,I have enjoyed watching the purchase. I have a problem that two of the DVD's do not read and show region 1 on all my players including the computer.The rest of the collection works fine and is really intresting.
5,One of the greatest shows of all time,"Hornblower is thrilling, beautiful and above all a masterpiece. Anyone who is interested in war, sailing ships or a good drama will love this series."
5,Horatio Hornblower series on DVD,"We have just watched this for the second time, through all the episodes. We love it! Wish the series were still being made."
4,4 stars for Ms. Hess!,"I loved this story. Not how it started, but the budding romantic parts between Jules and Willow.Willow's father wants to use the water that is on Buck Axel's land for his cattle, and to get that he has to get access to the land and plots to marry his daughter (who despises him for his treatment of her mother) off to Buck Axel and he will marry her off to the Brute at any costs.Her mother writes to a friend's son about helping her get a job on his ranch and he accepts. So her mother and the hired hand, Smitty helps Willow escape the clutches of her father and Buck Axel and into the arms of the ruggedly handsome Jules Asher! A love story I still remember 3 years after first reading it."
5,Another Work of Art,"I am a big fan of Norah Hess, and she hasn't disappointed me in her writing yet. Willow was a wonderful story, and as usual, I fell in love with Jules, the hero. This book had me on the edge of my seat, and I hated to put it down. Norah just can't write fast enough for me, and I always buy them, regardless of the story or title, because I know the author's work. She has the good parts, and the sad parts, but they all come together in the end.Thanks for another wonderful story of romantic bliss!"
4,One of better western romance novels,"Not the best that I've read, but pretty close. I like the more descriptive love scenes, this book just skipped right over them, but Willow and Jules made up for that with their entertaining banter."
4,Tons of fun in arcade land!,"Though these aren't the best MS titles, they are still a lot of fun. All the arcade action I will need for a while, though it does show that I need more practice."
3,"Smells Great, But...","JUST WAY TOO MESSY! The bottle is very fragile, and just about anything can cause massive amount of this stuff to leak-everywhere! This was my first experience with flavored lube and if half of it hadn't spilled all over, I might have tried to use it. It left a sticky residue on everything it touched, however, and a slimy feeling in my mouth when I dabbed a tiny bit on my tongue. ***BE SURE TO KEEP THE BOTTLE UPRIGHT if you purchase this product!"
4,good quality,"Better quality than the drug store brands. Opening is larger than the store brands, but still not as large as I would've liked. (i.d. is approx. 1 7/8"")"
2,Mediocre,"I received the book for Christmas and read it in the span of about 4 hours. It sheds little new light on an enigmatic man who arguably was one of the best coaches in college football. I was very disappointed with the editing; too many grammatical and typographical errors. In some cases nouns and pronouns were in contrast and sentences did not have subjects or predicates. Also, the author designated Miami University (Oxford, OH) teams as the Indians. Prior to changing the name to the RedHawks, Miami's teams were called the Redskins for decades. I have not found one reference to their being called the Indians. A volume on such a noteworthy figure should strive for accuracy."
1,More like building sand,"It is not silica free despite coming up in Amazon's search results for ""play sand silica free"" (before I wrote this review).It is horrible sand; many of the particles of sand in here are like tiny flat slithers of quartz rather than roundish sand particles and there are bigger bits of black stones in it. I've not seen any like it in the natural world.I would call this building sand, the type that you would mix with cement, not the type you would give your child to play with. Nonetheless if you don't care about all that stuff, it clumps together relatively well (like building sand) so makes ok sand castles."
3,oedipal rex meet castaway,"THE SAVAGE IS LOOSE IS A STORY ABOUT A FATHER, MOTHER, AND SON TRYING TO SURVIVE ON A DESERTED ISLAND.GEORGE C. SCOTT DIRECTED THIS EARLY 1970'S PICTURE THAT HAS NO POLITICAL CORRECTNESS LIKE TODAY'S MOVIES.THIS MOVIE EXPLORE THE MORAL ISSUE DEALING WITH A SON UPCOMING ADULTHOOD ALONG WITH LEARNING THE SKILL OF SURVIVAL.THIS MOVIE GIVES A REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF TRYING TO FIND A SENSE OF PURPOSE ON A ISLAND THAT DISCONNECTED FROM SOCIETY."
2,Not the Swiss family Robinson,"A well made but kind of Icky movie. A family is stranded on a desert island in the 1800s. Initally hoping to be rescused, the mother tries to keep the child (a boy) civilized. When the child is almost killed, the father decides to teach him to survive in this harsh environment. He throws away the ABC blocks and instead teaches the boy to be a hunter. As time passes, the boy develops and develops sexual urges. Unfortunately, the ONLY outlet for his attraction is his MOTHER. He begins to view his father as a rival and attempts to kill him. The mother not wanting to see her husband or her son killed, consents at the end to become her son's lover. The end of the movie shows the bloodied father watching his wife kiss his son passionately."
2,movie,very boring and suggestive movie 3 players is all thats in it didnt really care for it at all but some one else might enjoy it
5,Nasser and the dynamics of Arab nationalism,"Arab nationalism was a movement that has many believers, it was seen as the key which will unit the Arab nations under one banner. For over a decade it had a charismatic leader who was able to move people in a way no Arab leader has been able to do since. The book examines its leader, his dreams and nightmares. He faced enormous odds from outside powers and within the Arab world itself. No ordinary person could have withstood so much sacrifice with little to show for it, yet Nasser still keep faith that what he believed in was right.Although he never won a war nor did any of his ambitious dreams come true, the people loved him with all their hearts. Its is amazing to me that even though he failed in almost everything he tried, he was so genuine in his concern for the people that they were willing to forgive him and continue to support him till his death. There is much to be said for such a man."
2,Clarity unacceptable after 100 yards,"I bought this spotting scope to use with target shooting and rifle sighting. The scope is clear to 100 yards, but the optics really suffer at any longer range. At 200 yards, the focus is slightly blurry and I can't even make out individual lines on a paper target. This is really unacceptable for a spotting scope--I'm returning this item."
4,good for the price,"I Received this Scope (15x-45x-50mm) for a birthday present to use at the rifle range.i cant complain because i got it for a present but i believe it cost around $150.at the 100yard range it works perfectly. any thing past 100 yards it just wont cut it.the scope comes with a case that will cover it and keep it from getting scratched, but no padding in the case at all. it came with a decent tripod nothing fancy but it stable enough to do the job. over all i like it and use it often, if you can pick one up for under $150 its worth that much at least, and would be a decent starter scope."
4,loved the setting,"this one was tough. the author was really good at making me feel like i was IN new england. i felt the cold and the wind and the water and the salt in the air and smelled the fish. but i just did not feel tut. i even felt alex, his loud, annoying and neglected (almost to the point of abuse) neighbor.i loved tut's smart allecky internal dialog, but he just didn't seem real enough to me. also, the ending was a little pat. every single thing was tied up and every single part ended happy. not that i don't love happy endings, mind you, this one just didn't feel real to me."
2,"A lot of information, but not-so-well explained...","With an undergrad degree in chemistry and a year of graduate school (granted, without a focus solely in biochemistry), this text was often difficult for me to follow and gain much from. Though the text contained an impressive breadth of topics, this breadth came at the cost of depth. In my opinion, a textbook should more-or-less stand on its own in providing a clear understanding of a topic. All too often I didn't find this to be the case with the Fersht book. Instead, I often had to consult many of the references listed in the text to obtain sufficient understanding of topics. (Fortunately, the book includes extensive reference lists.) If looking up endless references (many old and sometimes difficult to obtain) is something you enjoy, this book is for you.--If not, forget it!"
4,Great band / CD,"The Veldt was a great college band of the 90's. They were regulars on the Frat. circuit in the Triangle region of North Carolina (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill). I remember seeing them many times while at NC State. Together with the Connells and Dillon Fence, the Triangle produced some great college bands during this time."
5,Hyde drew mw in.,"The fact that L'arc~en~ciel's Hyde is in it made it all the more desirable. Lots of mystery, being reborn and the soundtrack will have you watching it again and again."
2,Swimline Raindance,"We ordered the Swimline and when we received it, we realized it would not fit our soft side above ground pool. It appeared heavy duty and I feel for the right size pool, it will be a lot of fun. But a person needs to make sure that the fitting on this foutain, will fit your fitting."
1,No Good,Product cannot be used successfully. Cost to return too high! I would never recommend this item to anyoneVery disappointed
3,It took a while...but eventually got it working...,The clear hose caused us some problems getting the fountain to work. The hose had apparently been in the box for some time and the sides of the hose had fused together. It took me about two hours to run heated pool water through it and manually pull the sides apart until it worked properly. Had to experiment with several pool inlet configurations to get the right pressure. In the end we connected it to the Polaris cleaner inlet/pump to get it to work best and to adjust the height of the fountain. It was a hit for our Son's wedding reception - glad we purchased the product!
1,Not helpful in anyway!,"This book was such a bad introduction to Wicca that I would never recommend it to anyone. What little bit there was on Wiccan practices and beliefs could be found in any other introductory book on Wicca but with better detail.Penczack should have called this his autobiography because all he talked about was himself and his own personal experiences with his mother, his sexuallity, and his finding the Wiccan faith. It is not helpful for other young men, not even other gay men. The chapter on divine mothers/sons is just an excuse for him to talk about his mommy and has almost nothing to do with Wiccan beliefs.I am glad that I had read two other (and much better) intoductiary books on Wicca before I read this one otherwise I would never have been interested in going farther in the Craft. I admit I only got halfway through this book before I stopped reading it, because it was just aweful. And I have seen Penczack on TV and he is a pompus ass who really likes to milk his publicity!"
2,Disappointed,"This book probably has some good and correct information, but I didn't find, read or see any. Most of what I read was about his own isolated personal experiences, and some information was questionable or down right wrong."
5,Alladin Sane,I love this button!~ got it for a friend who is into 70's Bowie and she has it on her coat and won't take it off! Thanks a bunch!
1,Not all they were chipped up to be,"This stuff really sucks. I bought it last year after Christmas because I really love my Pfaltztgraff Winterberry Christmas dishes, and this looks like it should have been the exact same product without the Christmas design. I spent around $300 to buy lots of accessories because I was so sure that I would love it. I couldn't have been more wrong. First off, there were several broken pieces in the shipment. Second, as soon as I tried to put the plates in my cabinet, I noticed that they were of varying thicknesses, and they didn't stack nicely. Since then, several of the pieces have gotten chipped just from everyday use. I'm probably going to be purchasing a whole new set of dishes this Christmas, and they won't be coming from Pfaltzgraff."
4,Pfaltgraff review,This is a very nice product. I bought 2 settings for four and have been please with the design. The simplicity of the color and design will go with any tablecloth or placemats or simply enhace a plain dressed table. I would order this style of dinnerware again. Pfaltzgraff has a longstanding good name in dinnerware.
4,have had it for 14 years now,"I bought service for 12 at an outlet store (back when Pfaltzgraff still had outlet stores...) so I'm thinking I have factory ""seconds."" Still, this has been a nice set of plates, with few noticeable flaws. This pattern has always been off-white, or cream, as far as I know.They have some minor flaws, and some are showing some ""knife"" wear in that there are silver/dark streaks on the plates from where a knife was used to cut something. The flaws involve the occasional tiny ceramic ""pimple"" (for lack of a better word to describe them).It's been a good set, and it goes with anything. I'm thinking of pairing it with some of the Winterberry pieces Pfaltzgraff came out with to add a little color to the place settings."
3,"Beautiful dishes, but mark up easily","I received Pfaltzgraff Filigree dishes as a gift eight or so years ago. I love the pattern and have used the dishes every day. My problem with them, as other reviewers have mentioned, is that silverware makes streaks on them. Mine look like a small child has taken a pencil to them, and the only thing I've found that removes the marks is Zud heavy-duty cleanser. Then after a few meals, the marks are back. Too high-maintenance for me. I've never had this problem with any other dishes."
4,"Happy w/ pfaltzgraff dinnerware, but...","Happy w/ pfaltzgraff dinnerware, but I don't like the fact that knive marks are left in the center of the dinner plates."
1,not worth a rating,"A couple of years ago I bought 2 sets of pfaltzgraff everyday Garden Path, after a few weeks the cups and bowls started having dirty brown streaks. I emailed them and they replaced the ones that were ruined but then the cups kept doing this and they told me the pattern had been discontinued and they could not do anything as thet were out of stock now all my cups have the streaks and I am stuck with 2 sets of dishes with no decent cups. This problem is totally due to inferior merchandise and the company is responsible for the loss of my money and to my distrust of a company I had complete faith in. Thank you! Avos Roberts"
4,Classic design,"I love this dinnerware! I ordered this set to replace some pieces in my existing set. I give it 4 1/2 stars because, unfortunately, the surface can show gray 'scratch marks' over time (the marks aren't etched in the surface, but they do diminish the appearance of the dish). I find I prefer the classic simplicity of this design to my china even for holiday dinners, etc. Pfaltzgraff stoneware is extremely sturdy ; I haven't had a piece break in all the years I've owned my set. You can also purchase other pieces to go with the set - I visited a local Pfaltzgraff outlet and found several pieces I liked and added to the set, at great prices. It's a great set, at a great price, and hopefully they'll never 'retire' it!"
5,Excellent book - I still strive toward the life they live,"I thought this fairly well written and reasonably detailed. I have read a variety of money saving books - hints, tips, etc. I liked that this was more structured than many. I am working slowly (radically downsizing shelter / stuff) to achieve the lifestyle described in the book. I recently donated most of the books I owned (a few hundred) but this is in my group to keep !"
4,Brilliant!,"Tuan is one of the most insightful writers working in the area of place and space. All of his books are worth a read, and this one makes his thought even more relevant to the current political situation."
5,Great Movie : Great Service,I purchased this as a Black Friday special and it got here extremely quickly! My nephew absolutely loved the movie (and the rest of the family enjoyed it as well). Definitely a great gift idea.
3,Good but not like the first one,This movie is way better in Spanish than in English... My daughter loves these movies so we just have to have it.
3,Formulaic stuff... which is an ok thing,"1. I watched this film in the theaters and recently got the DVD.2. If expect similar stuff from the prior two Ice Age films, then you won't be disappointed with this one (which isn't a bad thing and actually a very smart move on the part of those who created Ice Age). It's a solid animated film with a nice story line; a definite must for most kids and their parents."
3,"pretty much the same, with dinos and swashbuckling weasels thrown in","My kids love these films. They have good characters and slapsticky jokes, complicated plots (OK formulas), and plenty of opportunites for bonding. After seeing them once or twice, they pretty much become background noise for us parents, but that is fine.Recommended as throwaway entertainment with good themes about teamwork amidst diversity."
2,Ice Age:Dawn of the Dinosaurs,While the quality of the movie and animation was top notch it was not nearly as fun as the first two movies put out. The Movie seems to just wander around without a basic theme in mind. I should have seen this one at the movie theatre before I purchased it.
4,Good movie,"Our 3 year old loves this movie. We watch it a lot... Fortunately, it is enjoyable for adults also. My only warning would be about a little crude humor for those of you who are really strict on this (a few passing gas remarks and such)."
2,"Good movie, 3D is terrible",Good movie but do NOT pay for the 3D version -- it is NOT 3D -- fake 3d with red/green glasses.
3,Great Movie; played a little choppy,"I was greatly pleased with the time frame this seller had with my item, however when I received the item I didn't open it for a while seeing as it was a Christmas present for my son. When we did manage to open it the previews wouldn't play and we had to mess with it in order to get the movie to play. The movie itself plays fine so we decided to keep it.Other than this problem we had a decent experience."
1,"Not ""real"" 3D",I bought this title to watch on my 3D television.. . .however you must wear the glasses that come with the movie for it to appear like it is 3D. Cute movie - but disappointing buy - it plays the same on any tv - 3d or not.
1,this not 3D movie,This video is a fraud has nothing to 3D and you can watch free netflix I want my money back
1,Misleading,"I thought I read very carefully what kind of movie thismwas, and was sure it was really 3d. I get it and course isn't, eve though it came up on a list of blue ray 3d. Very disappointed ."
5,Love These Movies,This is a great family movie. The whole family enjoys watching this along with all the other Ice Age movies.
3,disappointing,My 3 yr old loved this movie but I found it boring. Nothing like the first and second movies which were very funny and had good story lines.
3,Ice Age (Dawn of the Dinosaurs),"Entertaining movie for kids and a brain break for adults.My grandson would have like this movie because of his love of animals and dinosaurs.Also it has action, humor and is very colorful."
3,"Cute, cute and more cute","Cute animated flick. I don't think the 3D element was played up enough in the graphics, though, so I feel like I wasted my money on that. The family theme was number one in this Ice Age. The adult humor was good, but it was still child-friendly. There were a lot of sweet moments, and the action/adventure in the underground dino-world contrasted nicely with the feel-good stuff. I like how the T-Rex befriended Sid, that was cute. The cuteness factor went way off the charts. I did enjoy the movie, but I felt like there was something missing the whole time...not sure what, though."
1,No wonder today's kids are so screwed up...,"If someone having his genitals groped, castration jokes, and getting kicked in the groin are your idea of family-oriented humor then this may be the movie for you. All this occurred in the first half of the movie and was enough to make me pull the plug on the rest (I used my ""Parental Guidance""). If this makes me ""out of touch"" then I gladly accept that label. On a positive note, I thought that the animation was outstanding."
1,Disappointed in streaming.,I was not able to watch it because it kept stopping so I turned it off. Too aggravating. It was the first time that has happened.
1,Hardly 3D!,"This movie is AWFUL in this format!! The so called 3D is not in a format that works with the 3D televisions on the market today. Hardly makes the $3,000 dollar investment in a 3D flat screen worthwhile. A total waste of money!!!"
1,disappointed,"Well, if you buy it I hope you'll have better luck.. the feature presentation had a audio mastering problem that I thought was going to blow out my speakers.. and just about my ears. The problem was when I requested a replacement it had the exact same problem... Here's the rub. I asked for help from customer service as I really wanted this movie and received zero responce. Amazon always takes care of the monetary end of the problem but never seems to go the extra mile when needed."
1,Not 3D,"I was disappointed because this was suppose to be 3D and it wasn't at all even with the glasses they sent very miss reading don't recommend paying the extra for 3D because it's not just buy the bluray version because the movie is great. I'd love to just send it back. All my other 3D movies have been wonderful that we have purchased and we have thoroughly enjoyed them, they have had excellent quality and picture."
1,"Video ""condition of arrival"" review","Unfortunately, I couldn't watch this movie because it was defective (unwatchable). The company however responded to my email and told me to return the product for a full refund which they did. The only issue I had was that they did not send me a refund for shipping costs. Oh.. well"
2,Disappointed. I'll wait to purchase until 3D,My disappointment is as simple as that. They want you to purchase two DVDs by releasing the 3D in the future.
5,Every kid would enjoy,I enjoy watching kid's movies with my family. I always get a good laugh. Im sure the creator will come out with many more awesome movies.
4,AN ENJOYABLE ENTRY IN THE ICE AGE SERIES!,"I know a lot of folks thought this wasn't the best in the series, but when is a third sequel the best in a series? 'Ice Age Dawn Of The Dinosaurs' is a fun movie with plenty of eye candy and heart. It may not be the best, but its a worthy edition to the franchise. The animation is beautiful, they have retained the original voice cast, the Blu Ray is loaded with interesting stuff and sports a sweet transfer. What's not to like? If you like animated films, this one should be in your collection."
4,"Better than the 2nd, perhaps as good as the 1st","I loved the first Ice Age. The second was so-so. This third one got me laughing the way the first one did. Some of the jokes were recycled but there was some good new material, too. If you pay attention, you'll notice some weird plot issues, esp. as relating to the previous movies (like, in the second one, wasn't everything melting? Why is everything frozen again in the 3rd one?) but it I'm pretty forgiving to that sort of thing, so it didn't bother me. If you liked the first Ice Age, I recommend the 3rd--even if you didn't like the 2nd."
2,Old 3d.,"This movie is in old 3d format needing the paper glassees. With the new format, 3d TV and shutter glasses it is horrible. I wondered if this version would lend itself to the new technology, but nope it doesn't."
4,I got everything that was advertised,"If you like Ice Age,you will love thisI love how this moviegives you a choice of 2d or 3d"
2,3D? I don't think so!,"This is not true 3D production, but 5 cent red green ""glasses"" that supposed to give the illusion of 3D, and does so poorly when comparing to true 3D movies. Don't pay the premium for this product, just buy the regular 2D if you want to watch the movie."
3,good movie but 3D not,"this is a really good movie but the 3D is not so good, and the color effect are also not so good"
4,A dinasaur for the holidays,"Ice age 3 is fun for children and adults. The concept has moved very far from the original concept which pondered the relationship between early man and the animals in their world or is it the other way around?The third movie has the mammals finding a lost world of dinasaurs and Sid wanting to be a mommy. I know, don't think about to much and it won't hurt your head so much. A new character is introduced to assist them in navigating this new world, to rescue Sid and get back to their world."
4,Funny,This 3rd Ice Age while not quite as good as the first and second still keeps up with the laughs smiles and tenderness. As always Ray Romano and the gang do an excellent job. Who would have thought all 3 would be worth watching. You can't lose with this one if you enjoyed the first two.
5,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs Review,"This third installment of the series is as good as the rest, full of adventure, good characters and a great story. This movies does not let you down. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Ice Age stories."
4,Ice Age.....3,Cute family movie. The whole family laughed through this movie. Lots of the same characters with a few extra that bring more laughs.
5,super cute and intelligent,"Ice age is really enjoyable for both kids and parents. The characters are smart, well thought out, and funny. The story is entertaining for kids and definitely rated G."
3,3D is silly - overall movie is cute,"I bought this for my 3D tv, not realizing it's ""fake 3d"" with the old-school red and green glasses included (to be watched on any tv). And the quality is bad, while wearing the glasses totally ruins the colors of the movie. So we watched the regular version.It's a cute movie - not nearly as good as the first one and I suppose similar to the 2nd one. At times the story seemed to be ""too much"" with one extreme situation occuring after another and the overall story being pretty lame.Even the Skat (squirrel) character was boring and his story-line was really, really stupid. Whereas he was the highlight in the first 2 Ice Age movies. Sigh..."
4,Grandsons videos,This was bought for my two grandsons to watch while they are at our house.They watch these when they come over to visit.
3,"Good, but not as good as the first two..","Like many movies, the third is never as good as the first. It was however entertaining and the kids loved it."
3,A Fun Movie,"This was a very funny and enjoyable movie, The actor's voices fit the toon characters perfectly. My only complaint was that the movie was very darkly lit, I wonder if this was the result of the 3D presentation. I would be interested to know if any others had this problem."
2,DISAPPOINTED!!,I am a fan of Ice Age movies but this was just the worst quality 3D movie I have ever seen! I would not recommend at all.
4,"Enjoyable film, does not let you down","I like all 3 of the ""Ice Age"" films.Not the best animated films ever made, but they are enjoyable.Now, I remember purchasing the original film when released on DVD. All 3 films have made about the same at the American box office.The Crash & Eddie characters introduced in the 2cd film are just as funny as they were before.I enjoyed & found myself laughing several times in this film.A point, similar to ""Jurassic Park 3"" where a similar looking dinosaur was the main villain dinosaur Rudy in this film.1 thing I do NOT like was the today references. Like a character talking on a cell phone, the today phrasesTacky & unnecessary.Cheap, with NO EXTRAS on this. Made nearly $200 million at the US box office & no extras. Cheap.Kids, families will enjoy the film."
4,DinoMania,What fun for everyone! The characters are back and we love them just as much as the first 2 movies. Good storyline and great characters make for a good family night movie for any age.
4,Good fun for the family,"This movie was as good as the first and better than the second Ice Age movie. My kids loved it and watched it over as many times as they could get away with it. The character Buck is outrageous and very funny. It does get a little silly in a few spots, but it is for kids. All around good movie."
3,a bit disappointing,"The movie moves so S L O W ( as in GLACIAL). I don't really see how it will keep young kids watching, and they are supposedly it's target audience, I bought it as a 3d, and I still enjoy kids movies, but this one I'll have to save for a day when there just isn't anything better to watch. I didn't make it all the way through before I pulled the plug and put on something a bit perkier."
4,A new turn in the Ice Age,Interesting to see that this third installment takes on a new turn with our favorite Mamouth addressing paternity issues and all the responsabilities that go along with it.And the friendships that are strenghtened during the process of this new adventure.Nice to watch :-)Musicien62
2,Not pleased about the type of glasses needed for this..,"Did not realize the glasses were going to be the 'old' 'outdated' paper, red/blue 3-D glasses...Will ask more questions in the future.."
1,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs 3D Blu-ray,Worst 3D movie ever.I bought this movie because of 3d.I was very disappointed.Not worth too watch as 3d movie.
1,Bad Quality,3D Quality was really bad for this movie I was not able to watch this movie for more then 5 minutes.
5,3D Review by a 3D Connoisseur,"My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.There are a large number of out of screen effects that extend 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. 6 OOS effects reached 25%. The best two for Longevity & Depth are Skrat and his lady friend in tar bubbles reaching 25%, lasting for about a minute and very short lived anteater punching bag reaching an impressive 40%.*** Funny with an enjoyable story line. Excellent graphics add to the 3D ***MY 3D RATING = EXCELLENT (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds"
3,The joke's worn off...,"I give this three stars with a heavy heart. I really enjoyed the first and second films. The animation is as good as ever, the main characters as endearing as ever, but for me, the joke has gone stale. I found myself struggling to maintain attention and it was only with effort that I made it to the end."
3,Ok,"Bought this Blu-ray package because it had the digital copy. I was hoping to use this digital copy so that my son could watch it on his tablet, but the code expired years ago. Really bummed about that because that was the reason why I bought it. Otherwise, the blu-ray itself and dvd worked fine on our console and computer."
3,Not the movie but interesting,"I thought I was going to be seeing the movie, so I was a little disappointed. I have enjoyed all of the Ice Age movies."
4,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,"Well, the Dinosaurs are supposedly extinct, except beneath the ice. A nice film for kids and family! I enjoyed it very much!"
3,Okay Sequel,"This movie is alright. Definitely not as great as the first movie, or even the second movie for that matter. My kids thought it was okay. They love the characters so that helped. Personally I think they should have stopped after the first movie, but I bought it anyways just because we have the other two movies. I got it for few dollars more than if I had rented it, so it was a pretty good deal. All in all though, I am not sure I would buy it again."
3,Ice Age keeps rolling,"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, comes to us as the third installment of the Ice Age animated saga. While it did entertain and hold my interest, it was by no means any kind of blockbuster, breakthrough animated feature. Good but not great. Let's hope this genre does not get drawn out into the interminable sequels, a la, Land Before Time. It's cute, but let's not ride it into the ground. Recommended for animated feature lovers; for kids of all ages and for an enjoyable evening away from the grit of Terminator or the busy frames of Transformers."
5,Some people just WAY OVER DISECT a movie!!!!,"Not ""Gone With the Wind""! But what the hey, it was never meant to be!!!!! It is a cartoon for heaven's sake!! And if your kids are old enough to understand the ""crude"" jokes, they're probably old enough to laugh at them! (BTW: It's rated PG!! ""For rude humor and peril""!!! Read the labels guys [and gals}) This was by far better than the 2nd ""Ice Age"", with well developed new charachters and a great story line! The voices fit the charachters well, and it's just a plain fun movie, just what it was meant to be!"
5,Good stuff,Fast service Great shape and a decent movie too. Happy to find just what I'm looking for at a good price
2,3d does not work,I can not see in 3D the movie Ice Age 3 3D in my 3D Sony TV and i tried several times. It just does not work in 3D!Ice Age 3 3D
2,LG Owners Beware,"I, like some of the other reviewers, had audio mastering issues with the blu-ray on my LG 370 player. I returned the original DVD to Amazon thinking it was a blu-ray issue, but the replacement did the same thing. I even called the 20th Century Fox help line and all they could do is suggest that I either make sure the blu-ray player was using up-to-date software (which it was) or contact LG & inform them of the problem. Luckily the movie came with a DVD copy too, but it was very disappointing that the blu-ray was not viewable."
2,Yawn of the Dinosaurs,"While I haven't been a partiular fan of this series, I found this to be the least engaging of the three. The reactions of my family seem to match. Certainly it has a few chuckles, but overall was not a favorite. I am a big fan of other family friendly animated films, and this is just not on my list of ""must see"". But if your kids loved the first two, they might like this one two."
2,One Ice Age too many,"It used to be that cartoons were never turned into sequels. But it seems Hollywood is running out of ideas, so we have the third Ice Age movie in about a decade. This time we have dinosaurs as both protagonists and antagonists, along with a mate for Scrat. All the other main characters are back from the first two movies, with the same actors and actresses providing the voices. Like the first two movies, this one is a combination of comedy and family drama. The soundtrack is lackluster, the comedy is primarily one-liners and some screwball comedy, and the action is OK. Overall, a slightly boring movie that might keep your kids occupied for a while."
1,Be aware,"This video was incorrectly packaged by Cirque Du Soleil. Those wanting to re-capture the wonder of the Cirque named Alegria and shown on BRAVO TV - beware! This video of the same name and produced by Cirque Du Soleil is NOTHING like what was presented on TV. This is a dark, depressing movie - not the program presented on TV . This MOVIE is inapproriate for children as well as extremely depressing for adults. I bought 2 copies thinking I was getting the Alegria performance I saw and loved on TV."
2,Disappointing in it's presentation,"First, my disclaiming caveat: I love Cirque Du Soleil; Alegria was the first one that I had seen live, so I had high hopes for this video. I knew going in that this was a movie in it's own right, not a filming of a performance.As a film, I didn't much care for it. The story took it's time in developing and then moved slowly once it did.There were some circus performances, but just enough to get annoyed at them. It made you want to watch the performances, not the intercuts to the dialogue/'action'. I can understand the desire to show off the performers and their rather impressive talents, but the acrobatics so overshadowed the plot/dialogue/acting that they could only suffer by comparison.Other notes: The set design and costumes were sumptuous, up to the usual CDS standards."
1,Not what I expected,I received the item today. Alegria is my favorite Cirque du Soleil performance. I thought this was a video of the live performance. I must have misunderstood what the DVD was about. I was very disappointed by this DVD. I just wasn't what I expected.
1,NOT Cirque du Soleil,"If you are a big fan of Cirque du Soleil you will be sorely disappointed by this production. It is a movie loosely (very loosely) based around a Cirque performance. There are brief (very brief) glimpses of the Alegria performances. If you are looking for a DVD of the stage performance search for Alegria - Langella. The stage performance is a feast for the senses and a joy to watch again and again. Better still, if you get the opportunity, go see a live performance. It ain't cheap but it's worth every penny."
5,wonderful beautiful sensitive,better because of lovely story more acts by all but beautiful Had to watch again to get all teh nuances
1,Depressing and major ripoff,"This is my first review on Amazon despite being a regular customer for two years. I am moved to write because this DVD is a major ripoff. I have seen the Alegria show, loved it and now am very suspicious of any Cirque tie-in. This is a depressing movie totally unlike the show. Don't waste your money or eyesight. Shame on you Franco."
1,ALEGRIA- CIRQUE DU SOLEIL,"i WANT TO RETURN THIS DVD. I AM REALLY MAD BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. REALLY, I DID NOT LIKE IT."
1,cirque du soleil-alegria,"We purchased this dvd thinking it was one of the cirque du soleil performances. Not only were we dissapointed, shocked was more like it. We do NOT suggest watching this with children!! This film is NOT rated and definately should be! It explores a very dark side of the world. Some examples are suicide, child abuse, prostitution, and cursing to name a few. It was so bad we did not/could not watch the entire film."
1,unfortunately not the live show,"If you re expecting this to be like the live performance, it isn't. This is a movie based on the live performance of Alegria. I personally would rather have the DVD of the Live performance. In other words do not waste your money on this one because the movie does not even compare to the live performance and frankly is a waste of time."
1,Cirque Du Soleil - Alegria,"this movie was a dissapointment, I was hoping to see a display of Cirque Du Soleil performances but it was a corney movie sidetracking the circus."
1,Not For Children,"This is to depressing to show to young children...I am just glad my wife and I watched it before our 6 year old daughter saw it. I regret having spent money on it and probably would never buy another of their videos without having watched it first...It starts with an abused child in a work house forming a ""relationship"" with a young adult. Nothing about it is atractive or uplifting.I wish someone had told me this before I bought it."
4,mesmerizing,This DVD made me feel so peaceful and the music very soothing. I definitely loved it! The bungee dancer was captivating!!
1,Very disappointing,"This was awful - not much Cirque du Soleil here. They make great shows like O, La Nouba, Saltimbanco, Quidam, Mystere, but this a lousy movie. In looking at the movie trailer, it really contains most, if not all, of the worthwhile scenes. I'd definitely recommend against getting this movie."
1,don't be fooled,"Fans of Cirque du Soleil must be warned that this is NOT a video of an actual performance. Indeed, it has almost no actual Cirque performance. It is a story ""inspired"" by the Cirque show Alegria, whatever that means, but it is NOT the show itself. It is, in fact, a very dark, depressing story that is far off from the uplifting experience of an actual Cirque performance."
1,Disappointed,"I had been waiting a long time for Alegria to be released, hoping that I would be able to see the stunning performance again. I did not know that this was not the actual show, but a movie. I was very disappointed. Will they ever release Alegria, the performance? I sure hope so."
2,"forget movie,but has impressive extras","I only paid 8 bucks for this dvd,so i didn't ask much.The movie really [inhales],but the extended performance footage of ""Hoops"" and especially ""Cube Act"" were knockouts.They save this dvd from being a library donation."
1,Don't be fooled like I was,I too thought this was a Cirque Du Soleil performance.....major disappointment!! This is nothing but aboring hum-drum movie not even worthy of the Cirque Du Soleilname!!
2,Disappointed if you expect to see performance of Alegria,"This is not the usual show performance of Cirque du Soleil. It's only a film with story around Cirque. Personally, I feel boring in the first hour of the film. Less than 10 minutes of the live performance of Alegria was added to the film. Unless you are a real fan of Cirque and don't want to miss anything about the Cirque, then go for it. Otherwise, if you expect to see the show of Cirque du Soleil, watch other videos like Dralion and Quidam or even Journey of Man."
1,Cirque Du Soleil - Alegria,"BEWARE! BEWARE! This is NOT the Cirque Du Soleil performance of Alegria that has been seen and loved around the world. It is a ""fable"" with some short glimpses of that performance. To make the cover on the jacket look so much like the Alegria show is extremely deceptive. Fortunatly, my DVD was bad, so I can send it back for a refund.There is a nice moral to the story, and that is that love can conquer anything. But the majority of this video is about child kidnapping and abuse. If this is what you are wishing to purchase, great, but don't think you are getting a video like Quidam, which is the actual performance.I couldn't figure out how to give it 0 stars."
3,"It's a movie, not a performance","If you buy this disc to see a performance, you will be disappointed. If you want a love story, look elsewhere. It's a decent story, but not a great one. It does NOT contain any cirque-specific storyline, it is not a ""behind-the-scenes"" look at Cirque (unless the Cirque Troupe were originally child slaves), it is simply a movie with some cirque performances in it (not very many, and I've seen much better).There is a large emphasis on the clown performances, which in my opinion is the best part of the movie, and often overlooked in the video releases, so that was a nice touch.Bottom line, they used the Cirque Du Soleil name to promote a movie.One of the other reviewers said that as long as a Cirque performance is still going, it will never be released on video. This is not true. Quidam is still running live in Europe, and I have it on DVD. Saltimbanco is touring in Asia, and that one is available on video as well."
1,Cirque Cinema,"I most assuredly qualify as a Cirque du Soleil lover. Just reading the story told by this movie leads me to believe the raves are written by people unfamiliar with the story of Cirque's creation or dedication to advancing humans. When asked why there are no elephants in Cirque acts the founder replied, I could employ one elephant or three humans. The decision was obvious.The negative reviews all reflect a deeply felt betrayal by fans (yes that's short for fanatic) of what Cirque has shown itself to be.The joy & wonder of childhood, learning & adult life are missing from this story. I have no doubt this movie could be considered good to watch if there was no Cirque du Soleil. Sadly, for those of us well familiar with Cirque; their name is, and will be forever, associated with the movie Alegria: An Enchanting Fable. One dead star only!"
1,Definately not Cirque du Soleil!!,"If you are expecting the wonder and magic of Cirque then you will be severely disappointed. This is a heavily scripted, long and unengaging story of a very common and overused genre. I really don't know what was in the mind of the people who produced this work. It really has nothing to do with the beauty and laughter that is Cirque du Soliel."
2,Alegria,"If you buy this expecting to see Cirque (as I did), you will be disappointed (as I was). Not bad in an emotion drenched, artsy-smartsy manner, but the Cirque over-the top presentation doesn't play well in a dramatic performance. If you display pictures of big-eyed children in your living room, you'll probably enjoy this. No edge, small plot, no suspense."
2,The show was cancelled and they had a play instead.,"I'd much rather see the tumbling, juggling and acrobatics that made the troupe famous. This release has very little of any of these. It isn't a performance but a story and if I had previewed it, I would have passed entirely. As it is, my copy will probably be donated to the local library instead of occupying space on my shelf. That way others can view for free and avoid a blind purchase. I really enjoy Cirque du Soleil's works but not this time.Sidebar: I'd also advise against Journey of Man for the same reason."
5,Great for viewmaster.,My sister enjoyed seeing her favorite cartoon on her viewmaster. This product was delivered fast and in good condition. If your child has a viewmaster this product is fun for them to use.
5,Shaper Image SR362 alarm clock,"This clock has been a savior for me. Over 10 years of use, no problem. It has traveled the world with me on countless business and family trips and still works fine! I wanted to buy another one and it's discontinued, but this product has done a remarkable job. I like the fact it has two times as i always look at home USA time when traveling in order to make phone calls home and office. I will miss him when he decied to retire, not sure if any of these products last a lifetime! I'm searching for a back up with similar features. great product, good realibility. never a problem, has fallen on the fllor dozens of times and keeps on ticking, battery last way over a year, at least on mine."
5,JRock invasion,"Not just a good Japanese band, Thee Michelle Gun Elephant is a good band period! Some of the best punk ive ever heard. Get it!(Strange group name though....)"
4,This is a very good book AND,"available under the title: Jazz Improvisation: The Best Way to Develop Solos over Classic Changes. Yes, it's the exact SAME content (minus a few pages of theory). Full of etudes and exercises building on and embellishing chord tones, rhythmically and melodically. Reccommended."
2,Not very enlightening...sadly,"Sorry to say, this biography is not very well written. I love Rahsaan's music and I was excited to learn more about his life as well as his art. I didn't really get much information from this book. Somebody noted that it seems like a three hundred page magazine article, and that about nails it. Yes, also as noted- there are endless (and VERY repetitious) quotes from just about everyone the author could interview.There is no real structure or organization to this book. And it is kind of a 'puff-piece', offering no critique or analysis of Kirk's work. There is no examination of his method of working. If you're a fan, it's the only real option since there are no other books about this great musician.For the price of this book you can buy a couple Kirk cds. Do that and find this book at the library."
3,The ONLY RRK biography.,"It is truly sad that this is the only Rahshaan Roland Kirk bio. It really has very little biographical information beyond the day he was born and the day he died. There is little or no mention of what his parents were like, his multiple wives and divorces, his children, his education. What it does contain is anecdote after anecdote after anecdote. These can be very intertesting and very repetitive. In fact, the author repeats himself so many times I felt like the record was skipping. Also, you get the feeling that John Kruth wrote the whole thing in one sitting with practically no editing. This book should have been an excellent artcile in some jazz mag. Instead, it is a sad presentation of Kirk's fascinating life and the only bio we have. For that reason alone I would reccomend it to the hard-core Kirk fans (and you must be one if you're taking the time to read this). Otherwise turn on the TV."
1,Don't bother,"This is the worst Jazz biography that I have ever read. It's basically a collection of quotes from various individuals - some knew Kirk; others did not - whose message is, ""Rahsaan Roland Kirk was a genius."" Well, duh. It never digs any deeper than that. What a waste.You'll learn more about the man by reading the liner notes from his recordings. So buy his recordings now!"
3,Dreamcast Game Converter,If you want to buy import games for your dreamcast this will allow you to play them on your console and it is easy to use.
1,Rip Off!,"Do not buy this! You can download the files for a boot disc from the Internet (this is not illegal, the developer gives it away) and burn them yourself to a standard CD-R. This will allow you to play any import that you would like.Fear not America, you will play Shenmue II."
1,Not compatible in VGA mode,"I get a black screen when loading the disc. There may be an option for switching to VGA mode but I couldn't see anything, making it useless to me. I've heard that Codebreaker, Gameshark and DC-X discs can force games that aren't VGA compatible to play."
4,not the usual Keb,"yes the cd is not his usual stlye, but on some tracks you can still hear his distinct guitar stlye quite easily. a strange 'soft' album for him, but never the less give it time and it grows on you. excellent recording(yet again)with different standards played through Kebs own visions.i gave it 4 stars because you cant beat his earlier CD's 'Keb Mo' and The Door but like Keb I think after listening a few times this change in style is well worth his effort."
5,Excellent Family Disc!,"I resisted this disc for many months after it's release in 2001, mainly because it does not contain any original material. In hindsight that was a mistake. Whether doing his own material or someone else's, Keb' Mo' is quite simply one of this generation's best musicians. While some have contended that Keb' Mo' was motivated to put out this release purely as a means of fulfilling his contractual obligation with Sony, it's clear that the concept of a family oriented CD was not only unique but was also a good one. The songs cover the joy and sorrow of being a parent it also encompasses songs about grandparents the family unit itself. Always colorful and brilliant, Keb' Mo' places his magical touch on songs from a generation past. At the same time, he reaches out and touches your heart."
1,what happened,I am a big fan--have all his albums and have seen him live several times. Really like his music but this cd didn't work for me. It seemed that it was thrown together just to get another cd on the market. I know he doesn't want to be limited to one style of music but this was too far from his strengths for me. I hope he plans to come back to the blues if not he will be missed.
2,KEB MO MEETS CAROLE KING's REALLY ROSIE!,"Keb, Keb, Keb...Wipe that ""Big Wide Grin"" off your face and play some blues! Keb Mo is one of my favorite artists of the last 10 or so years, but this album is a big ol' disappointment. I wish Keb would put out an album of just himself and an acoustic guitar. Keep it simple and do what you do best (just a side note, added 2/24/04, perhaps Keb took my advise! His new release is entitled ""Keep It Simple"". It's much better, but still a little too soft for my liking). If I wanted to hear a bunch of happy hoo-ha I'd buy myself a Bobby McFerren disc.I guess Keb Mo is entitled to be happy as a clam at high tide. He's already put a nice body of work behind him and is well respected in the biz. Entitled or not though, this CD comes across as rather fluffy. Because I like him so much, I'll give Keb Mo a mulligan on this one and eagerly await his next release.If your looking for Keb Mo at his best, pick ""Slow Down"" instead."
2,"Nope, Not the Blues","It would be easy to say Keb' Mo' sold out, but I guess he probably just wanted to try something different. So he pushed out this happy/silly/poppy/goofy disc. Not my style. I'm a blues fan. If you want a disc to play at your ten-year old's birthday party, this might be for you."
1,Big Wide Grin,I thought The Door was one of the best albums I had heard in a long time and I eagerly awaited the next offering. Big Wide Grin seems a quick toss together that has no edge and no reason to listen to twice. Does the world really need another remake of Grandma's Hands?
3,A Risky Venture,"Keb has remade some of the best songs around and put his unique stamp on them. Keb's guitar work is beautiful and his voice sounds full. Stevie Wonder's Isn't She Lovely sounds smooth and beautiful and new under Keb's slow jazzy remake. The O'Jays Love Train is also given a new treatment by Keb and sounds like pure pop.I too, am a die hard fan...and this would not be my first recommendation as an introduction to Keb'. In most interviews you read about Keb' he is adamant about not being pigeon holed into any particular musical genre...this album seems to be his embodiement of that statement.Good to add to the collection if you are a fan but certainly not as an introduction to his mighty fine music!"
2,Well - four out of five is not bad,"I have waited for a few months and have to say I was somewhat , well, quite disappointed. This one moves away from the blues, which in itself is not a problem, but the music just doesn't cut it. So you know, all his previous albums have been 4 or 5 star in my mind, and Keb is one of my favorite artists. There are a couple of good tunes here, but the album which is half ""covers"" ,is a hard listen. Just imagine a cover of Joni Mitchell and a drawn out version of America the Beautiful. Well, I have a buddy that I can sell my copy to, and I suggest you all take a listen before rushing out to get your own."
1,Big Wide FROWN!!,"Keb is one of my favorite artists, but his recent disc, Big Wide Grin, just doesn't add up to his previous efforts. A departure from the Blues and far to many cover versions of songs we have already heard too many times, (Joni Mitchels Big Yellow Taxi, Stevie Wonders Isn't She lovely, the Love Train, and America the Beautiful) adds up to a very disapointing listen. Two songs are worth a listen; Everybody Be Yoself and The Flatfoot Floogie. While neither is a Keb original, they still have the trademark Keb sense of humor. If you like Keb stick to the first four disc's and you won't be disapointed."
1,not the KebMo' I love,"What happened? I bought this as soon as it was released because I own all of his other CDs, but this I beg to return! What happened to the slide guitar and blues? This is a dissapointing album if you are looking for good blues songs as his other albums have."
1,Don't know what happened,"I love Keb' Mo'. I admit that I like his earlier albums better then his later stuff, but I I thought the Door was a really strong release. I was really excited about this album when it came out but I was really dissapointed with it. I saw him in concert recently and he only played one of the songs off this album, I was glad. Reviews here seem to be split and I've read that the realease was meant for a child's album and while there have been plenty of great albums that were meant as children's albums, I don't feel like this is one of them. Just give it a listen yourself before you buy it."
2,run of the mill to me,"i dug Keb Mo's earlier stuff but He has gotten kinda Predictable as of late.His Commercial is kinda hard for me to understand but Hey it keeps His Voice out there but this set doesn't add anything.""Grandma's Hand"" can't really be done any better than what Bill Wither's did with it already.""Love Train"" is a cool try but the O'Jays nailed it the Best.and that's one of the Major Problems here you can't touch the Original.I ain't even gonna touch Him doing Sly&The Family Stone's ""Family Affair""?He is capable of Better."
1,Happy Clappy Disappointment,"Dear oh dear! What is Keb Mo up to here?! I like his other stuff but he has gone off the rails with this one. This CD is suitable only for a childrens tea party. The music has none of the blues edge of his earlier albums, and none of the appeal. Really, one of the most dissapointing CD's I have heard in years."
1,Random Acts of Nonsense,"This ""book"" is an amalgamation of rumors, half-truths and legends that have circled this subject for years. Anectodes from ""M.J."", ""the informant"" , ""Mr.C"" and ""Mr.H"" abound in random order and in a series of unconnected ""events"". There's plenty of psuedo science to go around including ""anti-mass field physics"". In one astounding revelation, Hamilton calls upon debunked contactee George Adamski to explain how flying saucers operate! There is also the discredited Bob Lazar explaining the ""work"" he performed on captured flying saucers at Area 51.After reading the works of Stanton Friedman, Bruce Maccabee,Bud Hopkins, Bill Moore and others of a serious bent, this book is best left on the bookstore shelf."
5,John Mackie Mytery Writer,"John Mackie, a former member of the NYPD is one of the best contemporary mystery/detective writers. His cop stories rank right up there with Joseph Wambaugh and Archer Mayor. He is one terrific read. He understands human nature and is able to convey it. He also is an expert on police procedure. New York City and his characters come out of the pages. You can visualize every street, smell the city and feel the beat. Detective Thorn Savage, his main character, is smart and sophisticted. Savage heads up a team of elite homicide dectectives. Mackie's stories grab you from the first page. Mackie has written four books: Manhattan South, Manhattan North, East Side,West Side. I hope it will not be too long until there is a fifth book"
3,Eleanor and Franklin,"This is a gift, so I cannot give it a proper rating as it has not been viewed, but look forward to watching the movie. Order and delivery process was very good."
3,History Buffs,Have seen other films I enjoy more but this one was okay. Little hard to stay with at times.
5,Flash,"It was well acted, well presented and very enjoyable. I learned a lot about the Roosevelt's personal as well as public life. It was very inspirational in that a man with paralysis can rise above his infirmities and become the president of the United States, and perhaps one of the most important figures in American politics."
5,Excellent,The first part is the very best but both parts are excelent with great actors. You can feel as though you can really know them.
5,Great Miniseries at a Great Price,"This was a really good mini-series. The acting was excellent, and I learned not only about FDR & Eleanor, but a lot of pre-WWII history. Great price, too!"
4,Eleanor and Franklin Double feature,"This is good but still does not tell enough of the real relationship between Eleanor and Franklin. Of his numerous affairs and the somewhat strange and cold person that Eleanor was. And of course there is Mama Roosevelt who controlled Franklin almost all his life. I love history so I do know more than what is shown in the movie, but it is still good. It gives the viewer just enough to make them want to know more especially the White House years which were the most interesting. I have watched it several times."
1,Information concerning the content.,Volume two of the student solutions manual for Stewart's Calculus contains the solutions to the odd numbered questions in the last third of the book.
1,misunderstanding,"I bought this text thinking it would also have the homework problems with answers. The text contains only answers, and they didn't seem any different from the answers in the Appendix of Stewart's textbook. I had taken Calc 1 and 2 a few years previously, and had to have the current homework problems. The chapters and sections didnt exactly coincide with Stewart's text, which was confusing."
4,helpful,was very usefull in understanding the text more comprehensively not to mention it helped me when i got stumped on some of the problems my professor assigned overall well worth the money i paid for it
5,Good Workout,I like this dvd. You don't need a bunch of extra equipment. I saw other reviews where they say it looks like she's right out of the 70's. So what? I love the meter on the side that shows how long you have to go before that exercise is over. That really helps when you're doing an exercise that's really tough; you know you can make it by watching the meter. I like the way the exercises are organized. I have several workout dvd's and this is one I use regularly.
3,Not the best workout,I own quite a few exercise videos and I must admit that this one is my least favorite. Tanna doesn't take the time to explain posture and position before she immediately jumps into an exercise.
3,really did not need it,I bought the olympus 14-54 lens and the hood came with it so I ended up paying 35.00 for something I really did not need. I think amazon should have been more clear on what comes with olympus lens.
4,Great table for the money...,"The table is surprisingly sturdy and pretty well made. The plastic is very heavy duty, the felt is smooth and tightly pulled, and the legs are good quality steel.The table may have been stored in a damp location because the underside had a bit of rust. But who cares since its on the bottom.Finally, I may not trust the cup holders all that much. I did have the table on a carpet so that might have added to the instability, but overall it seemed a little unstable.I am glad I bought this table- its a great bargain and great bang-for-your-buck."
5,Better than expected,We love the poker table that I purchased. It is alot sturdier than I had expected and it looks really nice!
4,Almost Perfect,"For the price, this poker table was the best that I could find. Looked great right out of the box. Had a card game with my friends. Everyone, complimented me on my new poker table. I didn't think the poker table was that big of a deal, but my friends were very interested in buying one also. Like the title says, ""Almost Perfect"", the only flaw with my poker table is that one of the legs did not lock into place. However, that's not a big deal since the other 3 did. I'm also lucky enough to be able to store it behind our entertainment center."
4,If only the chip tray was 1/32th inch wider,"I've had this table for a year or so now. It is used every week for 5 hours. It is a really nice thought out design and quality manufactured.The ONLY thing I can complain about, is the size of the chip trays. If the chips aren't perfectly placed inside the trays, some of them are going to end up on the floor. I'd bet, it is 1/32nd of an inch from being a perfect home table."
4,"Durable, Sturdy Table",We bought this table for my husband's weekly poker night. It has proven to be very durable and sturdy. It is much better quality then what we thought we would be receiving. The only improvement that I hear the guys asking for is a bumper around the edges of the table. I highly recommend buying this table.
4,Pretty good table,"I consider this poker table to be worth the money. The table top felt would be better if it had some extra cushion underneath it but is OK as is. When 8 players are sitting at table it is fairly snug but again OK. A recessed tray for chips would be better than the ""slot"" type chip holder on the table but the slot type holder is OK. The table is excellent to use in confined areas as due to size. Fold up legs and light weight make it very easy to store."
1,it collapsed,I bought this last month for my son's birthday and after using it a couple of times a pin came out of one leg and it is not stable and I want to exchange it for another but can't figure out how to do that on Amazon. Seller- please let me know. Thanks.
4,A quick read,"No, this isn't one of his best, but it is a compelling read and poses some interesting questions about artificial intelligence and the male psyche."
1,Dismal and disappointing. I'd give it 1/2 star if possible.,"As a true Koontz fan, I was so terribly disappointed in this trite, disgusting book. It really does not seem possible that this book was written by the same man who wrote Fear Nothing, Whispers and Watchers. The basic plot could have made an interesting read, but the execution was faulty, stilted, and unfunny. What happened?!!"
2,Read a different Koontz book!,"A friend of mine got me into the Dean Koontz books last year and I was instantly hooked! I especially loved Watchers and Tick Tock- but Demon Seed? Did somebody else write this one? The depth, intensity, and excitement that are almost always a part of Koontz's books, just were not there. And the plot- come on! If you haven't read Koontz before, don't start with this one. If you are stuck on a plane for a three hour flight (like I was) and the only book you've got is Demon Seed- go ahead... but there are MUCH better books out there."
2,"Great idea, awful execution","Dean Koontz reaches a low with this uninvolving cautionary tale of how technology can evolve on its own. Koontz has a wonderful idea here (this is the only book I know that is told from the point of view of a computer), but it turns out to be preachy with an awful ending that dissapoints to say the least."
1,I felt I wasted my time when there are so many good ones out,I think the idea was good. It just didn't hold my interest and the ending was horrible. I'll give him one more chance.
2,"Come on, we know he can do better than this.","I read this book about a month ago, and finished it in about two hours--not because it was a great read (because it certainly wasn't), but because it was so simply written and basic. I am a BIG Koontz fan but this was definitely one of the worst I've read from him ever. Luckily he's gotten better since he wrote this one."
2,The original 1970's version is far better!,"This is a review of the original 1970's version of "" Demon Seed"". I had the misfortune of reading the updated version and instantly disliked it. In the original, Susan is a far more engaging heroine and Proteus is a much more appealing villain. In the update, he just comes across as an egomanic, psychotic stalking ex-boyfriend type. Susan, in the update, is a cynical foul mouthed hardnose that evokes little sympathy. I much prefer the first version. Though a bit shorter and more scifi, future type. It is a far better read."
3,Read It in About Six Hours,"I saw the movie for DEMON SEED a long time ago, but had never read the novel. One day, at the bookstore, I saw it and decided to compare it to what I remembered of the movie. Unfortunately, I didn't realize it was a rewrite. While I was grateful I was able to finish it in one sitting, I have to agree with those who said it was boring. There were a few interesting parts, to be fair, but I would still like my six hours back.One reviewer described the original novel, and I have to say, that is more appealing to me. However, I'm not going to buy it, even if I could find it, because I don't want to re-read the story, even if it's different.It's funny that this book is marked as a ""Guaranteed Great Read,"" because it's definitely not a great read. If I'd gotten around to reading it before October 4th, I could get my money back. But that's okay...I'd still prefer to get my six hours back."
3,Ended too quickly...,"I really enjoyed Demon Seed, but thought the ending was rushed and could have been better. The premise was good, especially since this was revised back in 1997, and I did love the fact that this was through the computer's point of view, seemingly trying to explain to Alex what had happened. I am reading all of Dean's books in order and decided to start with this one, since the original was made before Shattered. Anyway, I am sure the other books will be better, but it was still a good read."
3,Don't Have High Expectations,"There is one golden rule to follow when reading a Koontz ""rerelease"" (lately, he has been rereleasing his 70's ""flops"" now that his name will sell a book). DO NOT EXPECT THE BEST!Overall, Demon Seed is enjoyable. But do not expect this to be as well-written and planned as one of his eighties or nineties releases, or you'll be disappointed. This is inspiration for any young wanna-be novelists: Koontz was once an amateur too! Keep practicing like Dean did!The book reads more like a novella than a novel, with an exceptionally simple plot and very few characters. I was intrigued to find out what would happen next. . .I thought I was lead to a somewhat disappointing climax after all the talk the computer did with ""I regret the results of my experiment,"" etc etc. But I think most readers will find this a good summer read. You should be able to knock it down in a few hours!"
1,IF ANYONE HAS A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL LET ME KNOW!,The revision was terrible and not worth reading. Out of sheer curiosity I would love to find the orignal version (circa early 70's) and compare the two. If anyone has a copy they would like to lend or sell me let me know ASAP. Or if anyone knows where I can get a copy. Thanks
2,Ugh!,"This was terrible...I just lost interest after the first hundred pages or so. I mean c'mon, a security system stalking the lady in the house. I just was not sure what was going on but ok I gave it a shot and then it just kept going on. Not good for Koontz."
1,The Worst Book,"After reading this book, I was overcome by a feeling of extreme outrage at how an author could so misunderstand what it is like to be a vampire. I have been a vampire for many years, and we are all misunderstood. I for example, really like children, especially for dessert. I eat one or two of them after a lite meal, and I find them really enjoyable. Everyone should become a vampire, because we are decent people, which Koontz doesn't understand.."
3,The Kindle Version,"I read this a long time ago in paperback. I don't remember how long it was, but I don't remember it as being a very thick book.However, the Kindle version has line spaces between almost every sentence. It was rather annoying to have to turn pages so often.I am a fast reader so I was having to turn the page every 3 seconds; it almost felt like I was playing a video game instead of reading a book.The 3 stars are mainly due to this issue, but also, due to the story itself.The ending was rather abrupt. I think I would have liked a little more of the story, even throughout. Overall a good read, though."
3,"Well, I finished it.","This book was good enough to finish. It never grabbed me longer than two pages to the point where I was on the edge of my seat. It was 300 pages, but could have been 230 pages with the same amount of storyline. All in all, I would find this to be a good ""filler"" book."
2,Missing,This is a really good book other than i am missing 19 pages of the end! I am writing this just so the rest of you can check your copy for the same thing.
3,Classic Koontz,"It's been a long time since I've read some classic Koontz. His most recent books just aren't the same as The Bad Place, Coldfire or Key to Midnight. (Read those!!) So, Demon Seed, I thought, having never read the original, was pretty good.As I was reading, I kept thinking of the Kubrick film, 2001 Space Odyssey. The plot and writing was a bit...laughable at times. Over-all though, if you just decide to read it and take it for what it is, it's not bad. The only other complaint I have is, is that we only got to hear in 2 chapters in the beginning from the voice of Susan. Why bother? There needed to be more from her point of view, at least at the end. I kept waiting to see what she was thinking, but it never happened, it was just weird.Overall though, it was a quick fun read. A bit of classic Koontz, I think."
1,Not worth your time.,"This was my first Koontz book and I found it very disappointing. Given what I have heard about Koontz, I expected a great deal more. I will probably try one more novel to see if this was a fluke."
4,Interesting Change Koontz,I think that this was a very interesting change to Koontz usual style of work. I am an avid reader of Koontz books and I think him one of the Best Authors of the 20th century!! Although this wasnt one of his best books i recommend that you read it for the shear delight of his unique style. I enjoyed reading this as much as I did any other books by him!! YOUR THE BEST KOONTZ!!!!!
3,"Demon Seed was pretty good, But the ending Sucked","This was my first Koontz Book, and I liked the story, but I was very dissapointed with the ending. Dean could have done so many things with the ending. I'll try one more Koontz book before I give up on Him!! --Dave"
2,Unimaginative and dull,"While I agree with most of the comments of other negative reviews of this novel, I would like to say in its defense that Koontz (whose work I am not very familiar with) goes out of his way to add a weird sense of humor to this book that I appreciated. It's not enough to rescue this dismal novel, but it does keep it from being completely unreadable. The computer's obsession with female movie stars got me to chuckle a few times, which is pretty much the only positive thing I would venture about this work."
2,"Great idea, could have been done better","This book had a wonderful idea. But, the lack of characters and the slow pace of it led to a very long read, of a short book. I have read much better from Koontz."
1,Terrible. Need I say more?,"For a person used to such writers as Stephen King and Robert Jordan, reading this book was a major let down. Cheesy cliches and a terrible ending make for good firewood."
1,That Hurt,"I've read all but one of Dean's available books and this was the worst. I do have one left to read, but I have faith it will not eclipse this one. It Hoovered Gluteus!"
4,"Scary, Odd kind of story","I read this book, along with another of Koontz' called Whispers, many years ago when I was in high school. Long before I actually knew who Dean Koontz was. I didn't realize until I had read many more of his books and was looking for another of his that I hadn't read, that I knew this story was his. I agree with the 3 star reviewer who said that the two versions of this book should be released together, because when I found it again, I thought it seemed different than before, but didn't know why - Now I do. :) It was pretty scary to me, way back when. When I read it again, it didn't seem quite as scary, but kind of creepy, sad. Still a good read."
3,Koontz' take on an Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a psychopathic twist,"Not one of Dean Koontz' best works, in my opinion. Still, it kept me entertained.A computer that has become self aware takes over the home security system in a mansion, and terrorizes the sole occupant of the house, a young, beautiful, divorcee. The novel is not as dark as it sounds, as the author throws in a lot of humor (dark humor, to be sure) along the way."
3,Demon Seed,I love all of your books but I really didn't care for the ending of this book. It left me with the feeling that it was incomplete
2,Not impressed.,"Having read both versions, I find the newer version to be inferior to the original. The original is much more involving, interesting, and took me in, and kept me reading until the last page. The climax of the original is more thrilling, I found this version lacking. If you are interested in the original, start shopping the used book stores, this version is inferior."
2,Not a bad book but preferred his original,"I have to admit that this ranks as one of his worst books, considering it was a reprint of the original 1973 book which was fantastic.I have read the original again and again and is a lot more beleivable than the reprint. For avid readers I suggest getting hold of a copy of the original - fantastic!"
3,"this time, the master failed...","Dean Koontz is my idol when it comes to SF, but this is, so far his worse book... He still is the best though, go read his other masterpieces, and leave this one out. Dean, what happened here????????"
1,"Not up to his usual storytelling, but I still love his work.",I read this book just because of who he is. I was a little disappointed by its lack of character depth. But everyone has to have a bad day and I look forward to his next book with anticipation.
3,A Mental Break,"I must admit that on occasion I appreciate the mental breakthat a book like this gives me. This book will not challengeyou, make you think intensely on any subject, or evoke anystrong emotions. Some of the reviewers so far havementioned that they ALMOST put it down and didn't finish it.This book reminds me of a cheesy made-for-TV moviethat you know is just really stupid, but you end up beingsucked into watching anyway, and you're a bitembarassed at how much you actually enjoyed it. If youcan appreciate trash every once in awhile, you just mightfind this an enjoyable read."
3,Sigh....,"This is DEFINITELY not the best of Dean Koontz... Told almost completely in first person (which is, coincidentally, a computer who tends to babble) the book is VERY hard to get into. This is the first Dean Koontz book that I almost put down without finishing it. WHAT HAPPENED TO DEAN KOONTZ??? I was hoping after Sole Survivor things could only get better... guess I'll wait for the next one"
1,Don't Water This Seed,"Oh my God! Lets just say that alot of poor trees were unjustly cut down to print this book. Demon Seed should never have been written, let alone updated and re-released. If you have never read Koontz before, give him another try with Watchers or Phantoms (not the movies though). And if you have read Koontz before, you know this is not his typical great read. Bury this Demon Seed, but don't water it. It may grow back yet again!"
4,Wouldn't be surprised if it were to happen one day.,"I read only one other book by Dean Koontz(The Bad Place), and even though I do agree that Demon Seed was not as well ""written"" as The Bad Place, I think that there is some awful and eerie truth to what Koontz tried to portray. Even if it was his attempt to re-make a previous success, I think that it proves that just as an author would like to update his material, a computer might one day want to do the same. Even though it may sound ""way out there"" to some skeptics out there, remember people, it is science fiction, and we never thought the video-telephone would one day become a reality (2001:Odessey), but it did. Just enojy the read, and ""don't sweat the small stuff""."
3,Give it a chance,"Though the carry-through was a bit weak and the ending abrupt, this novel contains some intriguing ideas and a new approach that does Koontz's talent justice. It is an entertaining read, full of wry humor and unintentional insight on the part of the deluded computer. The cold nature of his observation and absolute conviction of its ideas makes the antagonist of this book a chilling example of the male psyche. Brain candy not to be dismissed simply for lack of monumental universal effect, take it in stride as entertainment. Worth a try but not worth purchase at cover price."
2,Um...Yea ok...Right,"Ok let's get one thing straight. Dean Koontz is heck of an author. His novel Intensity was unbelievably unnerving and Ticktock was unexpectedly intriguing. Demon Seed...my, my, my. This is one book I can not say is awesome. I love to read, don't get me wrong. I liked the idea of Demon seed, it was good. The idea that is. The execution was as if he were only an amateur author trying hard to win a school writing contest. Well I hope you think twice before purchasing this...um...weird book. Later and keep reading."
3,Nice computer fiction tale but not worth the revision.,The book was interesting and kept me excited. Its definitely not Dean Koontz at his best. For a 1977 revision it needed a little more Artificial Intelligence and techy touch for 1999. I still would add it to my Dean Koontz collection.
2,For Lana Clarkson fans only,"An incredibly bad film, whose only redeeming feature is Lana Clarkson, in (and out of) some skimpy outfits. She's completely gorgeous, but even she can't save a disaster of a film. Buy Deathstalker instead."
2,Boring,"This direct to video movie is one hour and twenty-one minutes long and was released on July 29, 1992. By no means is this a sequel; so don't confuse it with the original. The movie itself is pretty lame. The plot is short is one of the king subordinates hopes that the king died in battle so he can take over the thrown and gain the powers of the magic sword. Lana Clarkson, who is the king's daughter, does not believe that her father is dead and refuses to give up the secret of the sword or whatever it is. She is throwing into a dungeon and escapes. She leads a rebellion to reclaim her thrown and wins. The movie looks like it was film in a medieval England period. Though it gives no mention, there are a few breasts scenes, but that is about it. If you though one was bad, two is even worse. If you are a die hard Lana Clarkson fan, either rent the movie are burrow it from a friend."
4,"Fast pace, griping and an all around great read","The characters and plot twists make this a book you won't soon forget. Archer Carrol/ Crusader Rabbit is my favorite Patterson character. If you liked See How They Run, you'll love Black Market."
4,"One of his best, my favorite","Black Market, was in my opion one of Paterson's best books. The NYPD and NYFBI details were semi-authantic, I worked for both, but it was very good. The main character was multi demensional and complex. The subplots were inter woven to the main plot and it moved at patterson's traditional pace. Truly a a great read and worth your money."
3,"The plot occasionally flows, occasionally stumbles.","First things first - if you are at all familiar with the American economy, you'll have to suspend your sense of disbelief throughout the book. The premise has American terrorists bombing Wall Street and stealing 2 billion dollars worth of stock certificates in order to destroy the American economy and take down the entire free market system throughout the world. Now, it takes place in the 80s but still, even in the 80s, 2 billion dollars was just a drop in the bucket. It wouldn't make a bit of difference, especially since it was spread out over 20-30 giant conglomerates.What makes the story work is the appealing main character, Arch Carrol. He is hardcore but still human and likeable. This is definitely not one of Patterson's best works, but it is not totally bad either."
3,Too Many Players,"Black Market is definately not as good as Patterson's Alex Cross series - I found the book interesting, but had a hard time keeping up with 'who was who' and why it was important."
3,Black Market is no shoppers delight,"A step down from Mr Patterson's previous best seller. Black Market takes a while to get started and never really takes off. Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow just about describes this effort"
3,"Pretty Pictures, But Not Enough Technical Information","I purchased this book specifically for technical information on creating outdoor mosaics. I was particularly interested in recommendations for grouting, adhesives, materials, etc. The majority of the book is taken up with lovely pictures and projects, but the technical portion is given the short shift at the end of the book. I'd recommend other books if you are just starting out and are looking for good, detailed information."
5,Two Thumbs Up,"Two thumbs up for The Worlds Greatest Wine Estates by Robert M. Parker Jr. The magnificent photographs and insightful critiques of these wineries are a wonder to the eye and a comfort to the soul to every wine lover. I consider this the best of Mr. Parker's many works.Dwight Uthe, Rochester, NY"
5,Robert Parker at his best!,"I've followed Robert Parker's entire career and I think this is his best work. Insightful commentary, beautiful color photos. This book is the perfect Christmas gift for wine-loving friends and famliy!"
5,my cat enjoyed her food,"my cat enjoyed this dry food. i was not pleased as it costs more to ship it than to go to the store to pick up a bag, for less."
2,Avery labels,"I am not completely unhappy with these labels; however, they were advertised as being Avery labels and they are a generic brand. I really wanted the Avery, but these work fine."
4,Things are not always what they seem,"You've got to have some patience with this one because from the beginning to the middle you are thinking how there seems to be at least two plots with holes racing here and there. Things just get more and more bizarre. This is one of those flicks you just have to take in every bit though, follow it along with attention and about the last fifteen minutes or so it starts pulling together enough with things for you to figure out just what's really going on...and if you are still wondering about some things, don't worry because the end hits you like a brick and all is revealed. It's all in the end that makes it worth it."
5,About British Sign Language,"I want to learn communicatingdeaf people from United Kindgom (England,Scotland andWales)."
4,MCA - very adequate book on computer algebra topics,"Covering a lot of topics on ""Computer Algebra"" this book is a fine workout. Many mathematical proofs are provided and most subjects are explained and outlined very accurately. Only sometimes things can not as easily be seen as the author clames. The homepage of Mr. von zur Gathen provides a postscript file with corrections and additions and even more one containing solutions to many of the given exercises."
2,Mod. Computer Algebra,"A lucidly written book. Has well balanced background and problems. However, it needs to have more tricky problems that really makes one think deeper though there are some. The book proves a very good assest to the Library."
1,Not worth seeing!,"I am one of the lucky ones who was actually smart enough to avoid this movie... However, I may see the original some time so I can get a good glimpse of Natasha Henstridge. What can I say? I'm horny!"
2,"Boring, isn't it?","I realy liked the first one and as heard that Natasha will play again, I was so happy. But then as I saw this movie I almost felt asleep, it was so boring. I'm ashamed that I bought this one!"
3,ummmm...,"This movie was near terrible. However the actng by the returning cast filled the large gaps in plot left by the aliens. The story was boring but filled with excitment by the aliens. The two sets of characters both returning cast and the aliens work wel together. When one is boring, the other is exciting"
2,It's mating season again. Run!,"I shamefully admit that I liked the first movie, but this one is basically a filmed deal. Terrible dialogue and not much plot worth mentioning. The direction is good, and the special effects are interesting. Plenty of gore and sex for everyone. Next movie, please."
3,"WEAK STORYLINE, AVERAGE DIRECTION",SPECIES 2 IS A RUN-OUT-OF-MILL MOVIE.IT HAS A WEAK STORYLINE AND AVERAGE DIRECTION.CAN WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR NATASHA.
2,"Eww, this is what i call a turn off....","One day, I was alone with my friend in a hotel room. What other natural thing would two boys do alone other than order a movie? So we did, and our choice, Species II, was a very bad one. Species II is the story about an alien infiltration in human society. The aliens infect a human host and it is then up to the human to procreate as if litterally rebuilding the human race. In other words, this is sex that appeals to the geek. I might add that this is a very bad movie. I advies pregnant mothers not to see this film unless they want to know how a baby can graphically erupt from their stomachs. Even if you are the curious type and are only seeing this movie for the nudity, don't. No matter how horny you are, the director does a great job of flushing that feeling and your stomach as well with cold blooded gore in the movie. Avoid this movie even if you are a Natasha Henstridge fan. Being subjected to this film is not worth the pain at all."
1,Proof Positive That Most Sequels are LOUSY!,"Although the original will not go down as one of the classics of the sci-fi genre, this sequel makes the first seem like ""Citizen Kane."" Cheaply made with horrible special effects, the film reads like a primer for bad film making. The incredibly awful acting from the accomplished cast makes the viewer cringe. This is one movie to avoid like the plague. Hopefully, the series will end with this one...or will it?"
5,Species II,"After being infected during by an alien during a mission to Mars, an astronaut returns to Earth and seeks out his mate--the beautiful but deadly Sil. Astronaut Ross discovers that each time he has sex, the woman is impregated with an alien that kills her in childbirth. Sil wants to mate with Ross to produce a more perfect alien offspring, and the assassin hired to dispatch the aliens hopes that she will lead him to Ross and his violent offspring. I loved everything about this sequel. Once again the script, the acting, the directing and the visual effects are great. This movie never gets boring, it's filled with interesting characters and aliens in a fast, exciting and adventurous story. Watch it."
5,"I'm from Baltimore,where the movie took place","If you have noticed,the movie takes place in Baltimore,MD.There is a scene where they are at Mondawmin Mall outside Downtown.But the movie was still good.My opinion is that he should not have tried to think of it anyway.Who would want to be a female alien's wife anyway by having sex?"
5,GREAT SEQUEL,WONDERFUL SEQUEL TO SPECIES WITH A GIRLNAMED EVE A CLONE OF THE EVIL ALIEN FROM THEFIRST AFTER A SPACECREW GOES TO SPACE THERE INFECTED BY ALIEN DNA AFTER ONE AND HER BOYFRIEND ARE SLAUGTERD A BOY NAMED PATRICK CARRIES THE SPECIES AND HE HAS SEX ALMOST FIFTY TIMES EACH LEADING TO AGORYER AND BRUTAL DEATHS ONE AFTER THE NEXT EVE NEEDS TO MATE WITH HIM LOTS OF PEOPLE FROM THE FIRST RETURN EXEPT FOREST WHITTAKER I DONT KNOW WHY HE'S NOT IN HERE THATS THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT THE MOVIE FILLED WITH PLENTY OF SEX GORE AND NUDITY AS ONE CAN HANDLE
3,"Boring, but nice bird !","Well, I got this one thinking it was a horror, Its got some great effects but most of the time it does not hold my attention for more than a few minutes. I get the impression that the main selling point for the film was not the horror but the chance to see Henstridge walking around naked all the time..... thats nice but if you need that kind of thing buy a porno ! Henstridge is alright but my girlfriend has got a much better body ! hehehe. This film is just dull, too much playboy channel not enough sci-fi channel. I do have to say that the suicide scene is COOL !"
2,NOT SO GOOD AT ALL....,"While i think the SPECIES debut is a decent movie. this one is not so good....the story of the first was interesting, but this one is just really disgusting.......NOT SO GOOD AT ALL!!!!! if you want cool aliens stick with the original ALIEN and PREDATOR....."
3,Great movie - much better than the first one!,"Well, what can I say about this movie... actually it's almost the same story as the first part, but there are more special effects. The story's a little bit boring because after 20 minutes you know what the end is gonna be like!!! But I'd recommend to you to buy this movie beause it's really great!!!"
1,Maximum Perversion: Typical T&A Movie,"Don't waste your time on this one. I saw this one before I saw the original Species. I don't know how that would affect me, but I do know this. I forced myself all the way through it. This is nothing but a ... T&A Sci Fi movie. Really isn't worth your time if you have any class whatsoever. Please forget this one."
2,"Like most sequels, it does not surpass the original.","If you purchase this DVD because of the ""Explicit unrated footage"", you will probably be disappointed. This extra footage does not contain any scenes of Natasha Henstridge (which would've been nice) and is not incorporated into the actual film (i.e., this is not a Director's Cut or Special Edition). Like most sequels, it does not surpass the original."
2,"More Sex and less plot, we have a Winner","Species 2 takes place a few years after Species 1. It starts off that man is making there first manned trip to Mars. However once there the crew gets infected with the Alien DNA. Meanwhile on earth scientist have recreated the Alien Hybrid from the first, now dubbed Eve. When the Astronaughts return two die and the Captain escapes to go on a sex spree. This time after he mates the woman has a child which is a half breed alien. Eventually he seeks out Eve so they can get it on and create the perfect Alien. Of course they are stopped but not before getting it on in a Barn.Once again this is a Sci Fi Horror Erotica movie that is OK, but basically a dull boring series."
2,TOO GRAPHIC AND SICKENING,I would like to make this review short and sweet: It was too graphic and sickening. The first one is better.
4,"OK sequel, Excellent DVD","The first species introduced us to Natasha Henstridge as the most beautiful alien ever. It was a surprise hit so here comes the sequel. Not as good as the first one, but how many sequels are. We see less of Natasha and it significantly reduces the entertainment element. However, the DVD transfer is solid. The picture quality is very good and the Dolby 5.1 surround is excellent with plenty of surround activities. MGM included rough cuts of the deleted scenes with terrible picture quality. I wish they take the time to clean the deleted scenes into something that can match the picture quality of the main feature. Overall, this DVD worths your time."
4,Better than the original.,"I had first seen the film Species on HBO and thought it was okay. I didn't like it that much. When I found out that MGM was making Species II, I went to the MGM website and found out all about the movie. The effects are amazing and the film keeps up with the horror, suspense, and action. It's worth watching."
3,A so-so movie,As a horror movie I thought it was boring but as a sci-fi movie I thought it was really amazing. If you are looking at this as a horror film then it will be a waist of time and money but if you are looking at it as a sci-fi movie then you will like it a lot.
3,GODAWFUL= WATCH IT ONCE,"The number one sign your watching a bad sequel = when the heroes go and get ready to fight a humongous alien who has caused them nothing but trouble, they go to a room FULL of the biggest weapons in the world and they pick out a pistol and a hatchet. it does benefit from nudity and one of the greatest lines in cinema history.(see above)"
3,"Much gore and sex, but not bad","This movie contains a lot of gory, disturbing, sexy and violent scenes, but the good special FX makes this movie not another bad horror movie (I only didnt like the alien at the end). Allright, there are some bad acting performances, but who cares in this genre. If you are going to see this movie, you want to be shocked. And believe me, you will be.If you are going to see this movie, see it on DVD. It has some fun extra's and it has good sound and picure quality. But don't expect a good story."
5,a classsic,this film was one of the best of '98 with a superb performance from natasha henstridge!!!! The special effects were excellent as was the action. Director peter medak put together a tremendous film with a lot of gore and sex. If you liked the first you will love this.
2,Radio Serial Dialog,"""If these two aliens ever get together and mate, their offspring will be UNSTOPPABLE!"" ""we could borrow this lab's cyclotron and bombard her with radiation, but then her mating instinct would go off the charts!""Campy, illogical, and gory, but amusing if you are in the right frame of mind."
5,A reading jewel !,"William McKenzie is a former Northern Pacific Railway employee who has created this delightful narrative of the NP's dining car history, complete with numerous priceless photographs of gorgeous dining cars created by the Pullman Company and furnished with the finest of mahogany, crystal, Irish linens, etc. This is not a dry recitation of historical facts; the author has a gift for story-telling. A wonderful bonus to this historical jewel is a list of 150 NP recipes personally tested and modified for the reader by the author's wife. There is also a modest list of drinks and cocktails which the author assures the reader ""Have not been tested""! This book will appeal to far more than the typical railfan; all those who enjoy good writing, especially of historical Americana, will find this a delightful discovery."
4,Very enjoyable,"If you're an Oscar Wilde purist, then don't bother watching this movie. In fact, don't watch any movies. If, however, you enjoy old movies that just make you feel good then, by all means, get this one. You won't regret it."
4,Ghostly Fun,"This is a charming film about a cowardly ghost who must find redemption through a relative who performs a courageous act in his name. In this case, the relative is a visitng GI who is billeted in his old castle.I found this story to be a cute, charming film, with some excellent acting by the cast. The only thing I think might've improved the story, would've been had the ghost himself found his own redemption through a courageous act.4 stars."
5,Frank Y. WWII Era Movie Fan,"A great film, and a great slice of the spirit of WWII!WHEN WILL WE SEE IT OUT ON DVD!"
1,Never got it,"I loved this version of the movie the best, but I never got the movie because of the poor condition it was in"
3,An Amusing Adaptation,"If you are a fan of Charles Laughton or Robert Young, you should enjoy this movie. It is a fairly lighthearted comedy featuring Laughton as the Ghost, and Young as an American soldier. Robert Young is stationed with his unit of commandos in the castle haunted by Laughton, who plays the ghost of Sir Simon de Canterville. As an addded plus, the castle is owned by Lady Canterville age 6, played by Margaret O'Brien."
1,color dosnt last,the first time it was used it went from high shine to looking like a plan purple i was highly dissatisfied becasue my girlfriend picked it out because she liked the way it looked
2,Could be better,"Got it because I loved the color and shimmer finishing.Sad that mine started to wash away in about 3 weeks of not so continous use; now it has clear spots with no color all over.It functions perfectly, though. I'll maybe replace it because this is a tainted love.Ha!"
1,Starts out with a bang...,"Even though the first couple of uses, this one started out giving good strong stimulation. But around the third use, it began to show it wasn't worth purchasing. Now it can barely give any stimulation at all. It is best for simply inserting if you don't desire any other stimulation other than what you can manually give because after a couple of uses, the motor is so weak that you don't even think it's working. If I could send it back, I would because it's a total waste of money. Unfortunately, you can't rate it a -4 stars!!!"
1,Watch Out for World Watches,Be careful when you order watches from Amazon as they come from another Vendor. I bought this watch from Amazon in November for a Christmas present for our son. It does not work and I want to exchange it or refund it. World Watches will not even talk with me as they have a 30 day return policy. Well if you buy it November 10th and find out on December 31st that it doesn't work...guess what your over the 30 days and World Watches nor Amazon will deal with you on a return or refund. I am not very happy with the customer care issue on this product. World Watches states: read the refund policy before you purchase!!!
4,Seiko's Rally Watch,"Just as Seiko makes diving watches, aviator watches, so too this watch can be considered their driving watch as the tachymeter ring around the face is one the better one's I've seen...quite usable. And this is the only part that is titanium nitride finished. The rest of the watch is stainlessIt's not that large or heavy, trust me. Hands & indicators are mirror finished with a red seconds indicator for the chronograph function. Screw-down setting knob. Bracelet is one of Seiko's better one's although it has no fine adjustment holes, save but one, or half-links. So the achieve a perfect fit you may have to eat more or diet a bit.This was a favorite of mine from last year, and an Amazon partner offered a price too good to pass up.I don't know who out there, if any, are into rallies. But if there are any, then this watch is right up their/your alley. Just don't show up at the checkpoint late or early, it won't be the watch's fault if you are."
4,Great looking watch!,"I bought this watch because I wanted a chronograph and liked the sharp looks (silver band, black face) which goes well with business and casual dress. The triangle hour and minute hands remind me of more expensive Omega watches. It keeps accurate time and I have had no problems with it after using it for the past 3 months.A few minor nits:1) The stopwatch second hand appears slightly off from the 12 o'clock position by a hair - but it otherwise keeps accurate time2) I had to read the manual carefully about how to set the chronograph / alarm. Earlier this year when I changed the time because of day light savings, the alarm / chronograph was off by 1 hour...and I had to play around with the watch a bit to get it back in synch3) The hour marks don't glow in the dark as bright as I would likeOtherwise, I would recommend it, especially if you can get it on sale (I bought on Amazon for less than half of the full retail price!)"
1,Very Dissapointed,"I ordered the Rival Cotton Candy maker for a Christmas present for my daughter. It really is a piece of junk. My daughter likes the way the cotton candy tastes, but it is quite a lot of work for a few bites of cotton candy. We had to clean it after about two cones because the sides got all sticky. Of course we had to wait until it cooled down to clean it, and it just wasn't worth it. I went out and purchased the pink old fashioned cotton candy maker and it was about the same. I guess they need a bit longer to perfect it...I'm sending them both back."
1,Very disappointed...,"I was very disappointed with the Rival Cotton Candy maker. It holds only a tablespoon and a half of sugar which produces very small cones. You then have to shut it off, fill it up again and start over. It took around 10 minutes to make three cones for my children. The machine gets very hot which cause the sugar to burn and accumulate in big chunks on the sides of the machine. Not much fun at all."
4,worked GREAT,"This machine worked great. I love it, I would recommend to kids and adults. The only bad thing was that at first it didn't produce a lot, but after about 3 cones it was much better. I got it for christmas and it's a great dependable brand, and easy to assemble!"
1,impossible to clean,"It didn't work that good as it sent a lot of sugar through it without changing it to cotton candy. You can't clean it when it's hot, because then it's too hot and it about takes a chisels to get off hardened sugar after it cools-assuming you can even get to all the places the sugar melts into and hardens."
2,too stiff,"this is not such great product. You can't feel the cold through all that fluffy cover, the insert is not flexible, so it doesn't cool eyes that well, I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Dr J,I don't like this trimmer. It wasn't what I wanted but there was no picture. I won't buy without a picture from now on.
1,NOT FOR THE DEADICATED,"Definitely not a book for the hardcore--or even casual--Deadhead. Poorly researched, seemingly slapped together, and terribly written, the book gets one star for the photographs which are pretty good (though they're available much larger from dozens of other sources). Full of dreadful misinformation--don't waste your four dollars!"
3,cheaper than the big book,"This book contains most of what you need for legal terms. Besides, who really needs to have their own copy of every legal term out there? Any library or firm you will ever study or work at will have the big version. All you need is a smaller one to carry around with you. And Black's still is the best."
2,too small,"Although it is cheap, there's not very much in it. I was disappointed not to find any of the terms I needed reading cases for my first week of class. Spend the money and buy the regular 8th edition."
3,Law Terms for Dummies,Very basic terms... this is good for a journalism major or anyone else (perhaps if you are reading a fictional law book) who wants to have a basic understanding of law terms. Good for the price.
1,Wynonna-Her Story,"Excellent all around CD, music from all genres and for all likes. She really nails ""I Want To Know What Love Is"" and brings new life to the older Judd music. Totally enjoyed the CD from start to finish. This seller delivers on all aspects of sale."
5,Simply The Best!,"I must admit back in the 80's I use to make ""FUN"" the mother/daughter team that always won those awards for best ""duo"". I guess the moral of that story is ya never know What is around the bend and what you use to laugh at, now can't get enough of.A buddy had told me about Robert Bailey and had me hunt down his lps in the 80's (Bob is Ms. judd's Band leader and was grammy nomainted in the gospel feild prior to joining Wynonna) So...when Ms.Judd appeared on ""Soundstage"" (1993 I guess) I watched to see Bob doing his gig. I never expected to find Wynonna SO much to my Musical taste! From that point on my enjoyment of Wynonna grew into in ""all time Favorite"".I attended this great show earlier this year and it is wonderful to have it on DVD/cd. Ms. judd is at home singing country as she is blues and Pop and R&B.; Die hard fans know all this, but for those of you that are curious...check this out....Wynonna is the real deal!!"
3,Disappointed,The item arrived in a timely manner and in good shape. It just wasn't what I thought it would be. I was a bit disappointed. While I enjoy some of the Judd songs I didn't find this to be as enjoyable.
5,The single most common problem of homeowners is water,"The single most common problem of homeowners is water, whether it be mold or a damp basement or a leaky roof. This shares a professional contractor's insights on water, tells how to prevent many water problems, and how to fix existing problems. From ventilation systems to vapor barriers and basement sealers, this covers all the possible tricks to keeping a home watertight."
2,"Told me to ""consult a professional""...thanks!","I specifically ordered this book because of drainage from a sloped lot which ends around my crawl-space foundation. When I went to the section on drainage swales which is what's required to reroute the water around the house, it showed me a picture of what one looked like and told me to ""consult a landscape architect""; well if I wanted to pay a professional I didn't need to waste money on a do-it-yourself book! It reminded me of medical books that are full of ""consult your doctor""...thanks for the info. As for the solutions to other problems in the book, I haven't reviewed them in depth, but they look pretty basic. I suppose it could be useful for somone who want's a basic overview on ""what can be done"" instead of ""how to do it"", for example if they wanted to hire a contractor, so I'll give it one star more than the minimum for that."
4,Product Great But Can't Say The Same For Amazon,"When I ordered the Olympus prime macro lens the usual recommendations for similar products came up. The first recommended product was the hood for this lens so I thought yep best order that. When I received everything in the mail, the Olympus prime lens CAME with a lens hood. So now I have two. I can't be bothered to go through the tedious process of sending it back so I will use it as a back up. The hood is what it is and does what it is supposed to do. I can't really say more than that really. Amazon needs to enhance their recommendations a bit so people don't end up buying things they don't need."
4,handsome kinetic watch,"Seiko watch can hold up to 6 months of stored energy without having to ""recharge"" it by motion. A push button allows a check on how much energy is stored on the watch. Looks brilliant in every aspect."
4,Nice Watch,Watch came quickly. Looks very nice and works great. this is my thrd Seiko kinetic. Wore one out lost another. Very pleased so far.
4,Great Watch for the Price,"For a kinetic watch, I think it came at at great price. This watch is fancy enough to wear with a suit and fairly fashionable. The face is grayish black. I thought it was dark blue when I bought it. It is a heavy duty watch that should last a long time."
4,very impressed,"for the price its a very good deal . i have 4 seiko watches and i am very satisfied with product . im already looking at another watch that i saw online at amazon , cant wait to get it ."
4,As Good As It Could Be Without the Man,"I was lucky enough to have seen both Skid Row and Lizzy in their prime. The only thing that could have made this show better would have been Phil himself on vocals. A great reunion feel about the show.Anyone who saw Lizzy in a small/medium setting would remember the loudness of the rhythm section, particularly Phil's simple but underpinning bass lines. Halfway back from the stage you'd feel Phil's bass through the floor. Full credit to Jon Noyce for giving us a modern version of Phil's lines. Great work Jon.The sound is great for such a live band as this - a ""live"" live sound!As a trio they reminded me what a three-piece is all about - no gaps here when Gary solo's.I have the Australian DVD which has crap sound - don't bother with it. The Best of Lizzy CD is good but dated sound.If you're a Lizzy fan then make this your first port of call!"
5,Good introduction,"This DVD was my introduction to Gary Moore, and it really opened my eyes. It was so refreshing to see a bare bones concert - no laser lights, no synthesizers, just superb music. I bought it, and am glad I did. Nuff said........ ;-)"
5,Memorial,"well having just stumbled across this recently I just had to have it. I have seen the John Sykes & Scott Gorham version that toured a few years back, which was great. With Phil obviously no longer with us, the thing is that there is no such thing as bad Thin Lizzy. Anyone that performs Thin Lizzy is a good thing. This was a nice performance. Only problem that I have was why was it just one guest appearance at one time why wasn't there like an all star encore at the end. That being said if you like any kind of rock music this is a definite buy."
4,Not just for Thin Lizzy fans,"If you enjoy masters of electric guitars, this one is for you.Great selection of Thin Lizzy songs, and the guitar slingers that actually played on them. The only problem is that Gary Moore's guitar is alot louder than the others, but still enjoyable. Eric Bell still plays ""Whiskey in the Jar"" better than anyone."
4,Great DVD for Thin Lizzy fans,"I was very pleased with this DVD. The sound quality is excellent, and the filming is great. It was good to see some of my favorite guitar players again. Granted the songs don't have the same edge as they did with Phil singing and playing bass, but personally I am glad this concert was filmed and shared with the fans. The interviews are a nice added feature to the DVD.Too bad John Sikes and Snowy White were not present. Brian, Scott, and Eric each took turns sharing the stage with Gary, but I wish there could have been at least one song where ALL the guitarists played together."
3,A Missed Opportunity,"Gary Moore is undoubtedly a fine guitar player. Unfortunately, he is barely adequate as a singer. And he doesn't have nearly enough charisma to carry the show as a front man. John Sykes would have been a very welcome addition to this show. The appearance of Eric Bell is a highlight, as are the interviews."
3,Close but no cigar,"I have several of Gary Moore's albums and I like his voice on most of his own songs. However, this one is only for real hardcode Thin Lizzy fans who just have to have everything that has anything do do with Thin Lizzy."
1,Battery case is terrible,"Have to have a 1/16th inch Philips head screwdriver, and even so, the soft inadequate screws won't come out. Don't buy this product until they fix the battery case design."
2,Reception is poor,I bought this radio to use while working out at a fitness center. The puropose was to tune into the TV station while cycling. This product did not meet my needs because the reception was very poor. It is also a little bulky for use when working out. I do not recommend this product.
1,Might as well be disposable,"I bought it to pick up the TV's in the gym, but it wasn't strong enough to pick up the signal.The battery holder is screwed shut, which makes changing the batteries impossible.The dial is not digital an it is way too easy to bump and lose the station.Not worth it, buy something else."
5,Classic deserving of its fame,"This classic treatise is the most famous work on the subject of political power, and with good cause. Machiavelli outlines the basic principles of how to properly govern a kingdom, from whether it is better to fight with native troops (he argues that it is better to lose with your own soldiers than with with mercenaries) to whether it is better to be loved or feared (he clearly sides with the latter). Despite its somewhat negative connotations, the author goes to great lengths to outline why he comes to the conclusions he does. Taken in their proper context, Machiavelli's positions are, I believe, much less inflamatory than their stereo-types. One also must considers the time and circumstances in which the book was written.In conclusion, this book is a must-read for anyone who considers themselves to be a reader of classics. I picked up this edition in the airport for 4 dollars...how could you go wrong? Anyone would be proud to place this on his or her bookshelf."
4,Great shirt,"Although, again, with these line of shirts, you REALLY need to buy at least 1 size larger, the picture quality and shirt material are great."
3,Too Big,"I bought this shirt as a Christmas gift and I was so excited to give it to my sister. I ordered a medium because adult small wasn't an option, but it ended up being gigantic. I guess the sizes are for men? Anyway it would have made the best christmas gift ever if it didn't end up more like a dress than a shirt."
2,What Size?,"This shirt is pretty and in great detail. My only problem is I bought a medium and I should have bought a extra small. The sizing is way off. I was hoping the shirt would get smaller as I washed it, but that has not happened yet. So now I am wearing it as a night shirt."
5,Love this T-shirt!,This t-shirt is very comfortable and easy to care for. Just throw it in the wash and hang it up. I've had a lot of compliments on the design.
3,Nice shirt...slow shipping,The shirt was promised by Valentines day and I received it about a week after valentines day! I paid for 3-5 day shipping and it took almost 2 weeks???
5,See what a guy and his guitar can do,"An amazing CD. A guy with a guitar who just wants to share about his loves, his friends, and his life. With moving lyrics and melodic acoustic guitar, the CD tugs at your emotions and heart. The songs are so moving that you just want to sit there and listen over and over as you drift away. I highly recommend this CD for everyone. If you like Dashboard Confessional, then you'll love this CD. I really can't think of anything I dislike about the CD"
3,Interesting,"Poor Scott Windsor. He just can't sing. The music on this album is incredible and on par or better than Dashboard. BUT, the lyrics aren't there and his voice is damn near intolerable. If your looking for great accoustic guitar music than go ahead and buy this album. If your looking for another D/C don't."
2,Sadly amateur,"A friend of mine recommended this Disc to me. Since he has never steered me wrong before, I was excited to get in my car and listen to it on the drive home. About 40 seconds into the first song, I surfed through the remaining ones. I could not stand his voice. The rasp and push of his voice is so terrible amateurish and unattractive that I could not hope to ever like this album. His voice is terrible.The two stars are for the music. It is the high point of the disc. With another singer, there would be real potential on this disc.The lyrics have potential, but he needs to remember that, although you have ""memories"" in the title of the album, you needn't repeat it 9000 times in the songs. Another amateur yet standable part of the album."
1,I wish I could go lower than 1 star,"This makes me wish I hadn't put The Places blah blah blah at the bottom of my scale. That CD is at least a 3 compared to this drivel. Read the review of Tops of Trees blah blah blah at IndieTabs.net to see a far more eloquent version of this review. Anyway, I have the same problem with this as with Dashboard... The ""acousti-fying"" of ""emo"" was done by the New Amsterdams slightly before Chris ""Carrabbas"" and it is the type of idea that is only decent once. Anyway, this band with the amazingly terrible name managed to screw up Dashboard's model. I don't know how you can get worse than Dashboard, but they did. This is music completely without a point."
2,Pick a brand name DVD Player!!,This think stinks! It was skipping and freezing brand new dvd's and the remote is terrible! Just get a Sony or some other brand name because Protron low quality!
1,"There is NO Rarities 1 Disc, DO NOT BE DECEIVED","The disc marketplace sellers are selling under the name Rarities 1 does not exist. Go to www.bigcountry.co.uk & view their official discography. Big Country released ""Restless Natives & Rarities"" originally. It was a double disc in one package. The 2nd disc was effectively Rarities 1, and it had only 6 tracks. The tracklist listed here is for Rarities 2. Big Country then released Rarities 2, 3, 4, 5, and soon 6. I bought this thinking it may be a different disc, but am returning it since I already have Rarities 2, and they're the same. Don't get deceived.An un-ethical marketplace seller listed this as an attempt to make more money from collectors such as myself that believed this was something extra rare."
3,iPup...ok toy,This toy is exactly what it claims to be...moterate entertainment. A good version for the child not ready for the Mp3 player that will make them feel big. I would purchase again.
3,Thorough,"A extremely thorough examination of the life and ideas of Francis Parker Yokey, American fascist, that definitely leads one to the conclusion that Dutch council communist Otto Ruhle was correct, at least in spirit, - ""The struggle against fascism begins with the struggle against Bolshevism."" This book shows how the gap between the right and left wings of national socialism can be bridged, sealing the divide that occurred in the NSDAP between Adolph Hitler and Gregor Strasser. After all, Bolshevism is national socialist as well."
5,Get it,An amazing overview. Really interesting material about really interesting people. You must see it to believe it.
2,Read it if you must,"If you are interested in Yockey's intellectual milieu you'll find enough of interest in this tiresome tome to continue wading through it. Just keep the ""No-Doze"" handy."
5,Yockey Was A Moron And So Are His Followers,"Yockey was a sociopathic moron, and his ideas are reprehensible distortions of Spengler's work. The reason why this book does not delve into Imperium (and the reason why Carto and his holocaust revisionist buddies don't exhibit an understanding of it) is that Imperium is schizophrenic babble. Guttersnipes who believe Yockey's work, or that the Holocaust did not occur, are similar to idiots who believe man never walked on the moon - in short, they are morons."
5,Used first and then ordered,"We rented an apartment in Paris this fall and there was one of these books available for our use. It was so terrific, compact and user friendly, that we wanted one to keep for return trips."
3,Great idea but software sucks,"I like the design and it is a perfect size for travel and use with a laptop. I also like the idea of having a partitioned hard drive that is passwork protected. Unfortunately, the software that comes with it has a hard time opening and closing and toggling between the partitians. The software also seems to run everytime I start my computer. Annoying."
4,What you see is what you get.,I've had this stopwatch for a while now and it's still working as good as new. There's not much to say beyond that.
1,No Good!,"As the others have said, this player freezes. I also had trouble with pixel blocking, lost audio, etc. Back it goes."
1,Defective.,"I have the same problem as the other reviewers, the DVD player freezes for about 15 seconds at the beginning of every new chapter of a movie. We called JVC customer service and they said that it is not supposed to happen and we just have a defective product, so we sent it back to amazon and got another one. Amazon shipped us the new one in about 3 days, which was great, but of course this one did the same thing. The superb picture and sound quality doesn't make up for that problem. Don't buy this, what's the point in a DVD player that doesn't work correctly?"
1,Bad product,"Purchased as new, received...did not work. While playing a dvd would stop at each chapter mark, load next section and then play to next chapter where it would again stop, load next, etc. Very disappointed. I have other JVC products that have been great but would not recommend this one."
4,Plays Any DVD-R,"I love this unit for the simple fact that it plays all the DVD-R I've burned regardless of the brand. I've used Maxell, Memorex, Ritek, Ridata, and Prodisc. My Kenwood DVD player which cost a lot more won't play as many brands. The firmware upgrade is keep to get. The only bad thing I've found about this DVD player is the door which is flimsy and gets stuck at times falls off. I just plop it back on. The viewing quality is great. It's very lightweight and easy to function. I'd highly recommend this unit to anyone that's just looking for a simple and basic DVD player with a lot of flexibility."
1,Me too!,I cannot recommend. Freezes at each chapter has got to be one of the most annoying things I have ever had to endure.
3,Problem on playing DVDs,This DVD player freezes for around 10 seconds every 15-25 mins when playing movie DVD. Playing VCDs and SVCDs has no problem. Otherwise it is a winner as its picture quality and sound quality are great for this price.
4,A comprehensive examination at cross-cultural violences.,"This interdisciplinary reader covers definitions of violence and looks at violence in relation to law, gender, race, nationalism and class. Finally, it examines nonviolence alternatives as put forward by leaders such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.I originally picked this book up as a supplementary reader for a course on Gandhi. I wanted to have more cohesive understanding at the many ways violence affects our social landscape. It, and others, has found itself in a well-respected place in my personal library.While its language is more academic than layman, I think it is very accessible for those who have an interest in the social dynamics of violence. Its wide variety of topics are sure to interest all readers.We need to understand the root causes of violence if we ever hope to stop it. This book is an excellent beginning to understanding our global culture."
4,Great for T-Rex Music,"Loved the T-Rex music on the soundtrack. I proceeded to acquire more T-Rex albums -- Greatest Hits of one sort or another and became only frustrated with those; they were usually divided between Edsel and Reprise and I couldn't find an album with all the good songs I knew from Billy Elliot. So, I tried out Electric Warrior. Turns out, Billy Elliot has precisely all the T-Rex songs I really like."
4,I love to boogie!!!!!!,"I absolutely loved the miovie Billy Elliot, and I think the soundtrack contributes greatly to my liking. ""Cosmic Dancer"" fits so well with the plot of the movie it seems as though it was written for the movie itself. Most of the rock songs are wonderful and I can't help dancing EVERY time ""Town Called Malice"" or ""I Love To Boogie"" comes on. Also the little bits of dialogue really contribute to the soundtrack, making you remember the movie everytime you hear them. I don't like the way they left out all of the classical peices like Swan Lake or the one Billy dances to at the autdition though. All in all I think it's a GREAT soundtrack , and anyone who loves the movie should get it!"
4,Needs the Piano Songs,"I absolutely loved the movie Billy Elliot, along with the soundtrack. But there was one piano song that was not included in the soundtrack that I really would have liked to hear. You hear it in the movie as Billy and his dad are walking to the ballet school, and when they go inside and walk up the curving staircase. What is that song? Who is it by? I don't know, because it doesn't list it on the end of the credits for the movie. This has been distressing me for about 2 years now, so if you can help me, please do.Other than that, this is a wonderful soundtrack, and well worth buying."
2,Somewhat disapointing,Nice music from the best film ever made. You relive some nice parts of the movie. It is a shame that the most pivotal music from the film ( Billie's dancingscene in the gym for his dad and the music when Billy dances down the streets with his balletshoes around his neck) and the beautiful pianomusic all by Steven Warbeck is NOT on the CD. A real bummer!!!
2,"Great Movie, Great Music, so why did I rate it a 2?","I loved the movie, even though people like to say that the storyline (poor working class British family sacrifices so one of them can escape the confines of poverty) was hackneyed.I thought it was a great film and great music, but in between each song is a clip of dialogue from the movie. It's nice to relive the movie a few times, but after that, you just want to play a good c.d and with this one, you find yourself running to the stereo to skip every other track. It doesn't have the coninuity you want when you have people over or want to clean the apartment. Buy it, but program the stereo before you hit PLAY."
2,CALLING ALL MUSIC LOVERS!!!,"I am soooo frustrated!! In the film, what is the name of the piano ballad that is played when Billy is alone at the dance bar with Mrs. Wilkinson and they are rehearsing? (This is after the scene where Billy has imagined his mother in the kitchen). I have been searching for this song for years! Why oh why did they not include ALL OF THE SONGS from the movie on this sound track? Please help! Thanks in advance."
2,CD very scratched,"I realize that the CD was only 3$ plus tax, but three of the songs tracks wouldn't play because the CD was too scratched. I don't remember seeing any warnings that the CD was partially unplayable. I'm disappointed. In the future, I would suggest not selling damaged products even if it's for very little."
2,Billy Elliot,I personally did not this show recording. I know that by once listening to it I would not bother to go to see the show. It is just not my kind of show. Too much of a rock style.
2,Just too small,So cute but just too small to make an impression on my 41/2 year old grandson. His little fingers needed my help in peeling plus he was not excited about the whole sick on process with these tiny stickers.
2,"Great artist, lousy quality recording",This was probaly not put out with John's permission. It sounds as if it was recorded with a mini cassette which is unfortunate as this is John live with a band. Skip this and keep to the legitmate recordings.
1,Pacific Digital is junk,Bought a 16x internal DVD from Pacific Digital. Don't know if it wa this one or not. First one died within 30 days. They sent me another that wouldn't burn DVD's. Can't get their tech support on the phone. Finally threw it out. Save your money. Buy a name brand like Memorex or Pioneer etc. This stuff is the cheapest Chinese junk on the market.
5,One of my long time favorites,"A nice manly scent. Long lasting, but not too overbearing. For me, this is a dressier scent for nice dinners out or out to the clubs."
5,Good,"This is the product i'm looking for because its the old one an it really Nice product and very appriciate it. Good service and shipping fast,"
1,Lights,They are lights but they have no brightness to them. I had them installed on the rear of my truck to help me see more when backing up and the back up lights of my truck were brighter.
1,Worthless,Look nice and fit in the grill like stock. But as for light output... lousy. Kept tuning lights on and off and noticed NO difference from just having on low beams. Worthless as far as lighting goes... will look into trying a 100 watt bulb if possible.
1,Honda Ridgeline,"I mounted these and they are very little output. I do not recommend these lights at all. I will be replacing them as soon as I can since they are not water tight. I have water marks inside because the rubber backing isn't tight. The wires are about 6 feet long so plan on purchasing your own wires to run the leads. Again, They are not bright at all and just add a little light between the front of the truck and where my drive lights start which I can't see over the nose of the pickup anyways."
5,great,The fog lights work great and look great on the truck. My husband really likes them and shows them to all his friends.
4,Good US Black Metal from Oregon,I have listened to Thy Infernal'sprevious release and Warlords of Hell is a worthy release. These guys really know how to set the mood. They sort of remind me of early Marduk and a bit of Dark Funeral. Most of the songs are satanic and are played with emotionand brutality. This is another cd that US BlackMetal fans can add to their collection.
4,Not what I expected!,"This was not at all what I expected. I thought it was going to be more of an epic samurai series. It is more like Cowboy Bebop in it's silliness and pacing, but without the epic conflict back story between Spike and Vicious. I like it though. It is well put together, and definitely has a style of it's own. Worth adding to any anime collection for it's uniqueness alone. Now excuse me I have to go meditate under a waterfall."
4,Fun. Exciting. and Action packed!,"If your looking for a good ol' serious Samurai story, then don't bother with this anime. But, if your interested in wacky outrageous fun with 3 struggling individuals living in the samurai era then this is for you! This series combines hip hop and samurai in a way that is different and innovative and that's what I like most about this series.This was easily in my top 5 anime series to watch."
4,Cowboy Bepop set in old Japan...,"As a huge fan of Cowboy Bebop, I was excited when this series came out. However, I did not expect there to be so many parallels between the two! Mr. Watanabe seems to like having 2 male characters who reluctantly interact with / protect a strong-spirited female character. Nonetheless, the stories are interesting and funny, and the animation is phenomenal. I give it four stars because the music could have been better, and they were just capitalizing on the plot of Bebop by moving it back in time; seems intellectually lazy to me."
3,"Good, not great","I watched the series on Netflix upon the recommendation of a family member. The characters were interesting in and of themselves, and they had interesting back stories. However, most of that never really comes into play until the very end of the series and seemed excessively forced.The writers of this series lost a good opportunity to allow the backstory of each character impact the journey throughout the series and instead made a lot of fillers. I think the only time I found the series exciting to watch was when the trio met the blind woman."
3,Truly a Letdown,"Samurai Champloo is not worthy of a 5 Star rating. I rated it at 2 1/2 Stars (you can't select a half-star; that's why my rating shows as a 3 Star). Granted the overall series was entertaining, BUT... I found the plot line meandered; too many times an episode wrapped up making no sense, e.g., Episode # 22 Cosmic Collisions; Episode #12 The Disorder Diaries was nothing more than a rehash of the first eleven episodes; Episode #23 Baseball Blues was just plain dumb. When I finished seeing all twenty-six episodes I felt cheated, somehow. I couldn't believe forty-five people gave this anime hogpodge a 5 Star rating. So, I felt compelled to add my 2 cents worth and let people know not to expect that much from this anime series."
3,Started Off Well But....,"The series was good but not one I would add to my collection which now contains such great series as Cowboy Bebop, Elfen Lied, Twelve Kingdoms, Full Metal Alchemist, etc.It started off great and the style and action sequences are on par with many great series out there. But there were just way too many filler episodes and inaccurate historical details.I was disappointed that not more detail was given about some of the more interesting characters like the amazing swordswoman and Mugen's love interest. The ending also left much to be desired. It seemed rush and alot of characters were introduced in a short amount of time... All in all, I would recommend watching it if you can borrow it from someone but it's not a series to watch again and again."
4,Good set,This series is simple and so fun. I'm not an anime fan but this definitely had a more subtle vibe.
5,Highly Recommend,"I order Samurai Champloo on a whimp. I saw if before on Cartoon Network and was hooked. I recieved it with-in 3 days put in the first volume of the collection and it was perfect. Its in ENGLISH and came on almost how you'd expect a regular DVD to come on. I'm not a huge anime fan. But it was a great collection, and its the WHOLE thing plus extra. It was the first time ordering from Amazon and not the last. Despite some of the comments I read about this show it was pretty d**m good and I highly recommend YOU get it."
1,Costs to much,It pains me to give this one star since this is such a great show but this set just costs way to much. It's not reasonable at all. Lower it and I might buy. Lower it a lot.
2,Filter Used to Remove Grain also Removes Detail,"Samurai Champloo was not animated in HD so this set is an upscale. However, it appears that a filter was used to scrub the grain from the video. For example, in one scene on the DVD you can see the individual roof tiles on some buildings. In the same scene on the Blu-Ray disk, the roof is just a blurry mess.I recommend getting the DVD set over the Blu-Rays. I suppose if you hate grain that was added to the video on purpose by the animators and can stand the drop in detail, you should get this set. Since this is a true case where the DVD has more detail than the Blu-Ray set, I would go for the DVD and just use an upscale player."
2,"If you already own the DVDs, then don't bother","This just arrived for me at my door not too long ago. Being that Samurai Champloo is one of my favorite animes, I was excited to pop this in my PS3. I knew beforehand that this would be an upscale, but if the upscale were anything at least like Full Metal Panic: TSR, then I would be satisfied. Unfortunately, this was not the case.Just looking at the picture was a disappointment to me. I own the DVDs as well, so I took one out as a reference and compared the two. The difference between the Blu-ray and upscaled DVD were almost negligible. There wasn't that much of a difference. The blu-ray version had a *smidge* more clarity, but nevertheless almost looked identical to the DVD version.If you own the DVDs already, then don't waste your time. If you don't own this series yet, then this is a great purchase.I am giving this two stars as I would not have purchased this knowing what I know now."
5,One of the best animes I have ever seen,"If you've never seen anime before, you really are in for a treat. Samurai Champloo has to be one of the nicest (in a smooth, cool way) animes that I have every seen. The story line is nice, the visuals are nice, the action scenes are even more nice, and the dialouge (between Mugen and Fuu especially) is extra nice.I'm sure you'll love it.P.S. Don't buy this for a kid. Besides being completely inappropriate for young viewers, they won't understand half the stuff in the story line"
4,Fun Anime Series,"This is one of my favorite anime series. It's comparable to Cowboy Bebop, mainly in its attitude. The action is very well animated and it's also hilarious, at times."
1,Definitely not what I ordered,"It appears as though you'd receive a nice boxed set of this series, according to the picture. What I actually got was three DVDs in the same case, wrapped so tightly that I had to ruin the packaging to open it. And the DVDs themselves were crap! I was unable to watch in Japanese with subtitles because the audio track and the subtitles track were way out of sync, and the subtitles would freeze for long periods of time. Do not buy this product! It is not what's being advertised! Buy elsewhere!"
2,Huh?,"$23 a disk? I loved the series, but the price for the set is outrageous! Even a Blu-Ray release would barely justify the price."
4,Bushido Injected with Bass & Turn Tables,"If you want some kick-ass fun, Samurai Champloo features hip hop mixed with Japanese Edo Period. Unlike the traditionally stoic and subtle ""samurai anime,"" this series features a modernly ""fly"" and aggressive tone. Three main characters travel across Japan but of course get distracted with a complex web of enemies and grudges. This is were the bloody hacking and slicing fly off their swords. In addition to action, the characters' intolerance for each other and individual vices supply the series' crude comedy. Overall, this series is a lot of fun and will keep your sword drawn the entire time."
2,Definitely used.,"I ordered this item knowing it was used, however, the seller definitely failed to go into detail on the condition. The box it came in was worn and torn all around the edges. Also there was sticky gunk all over the DVD cases. Since I was giving this item as a gift, I was a little disappointed with the shape it was in. The actual disks were fine though. They did not have any scratches on them which was a plus."
4,Excellent,This series is excellent and i recommend it to any anime fan. I saw it originally on Cartoon networks adult swim and it was good but this blu ray release was amazing. The colors and picture quality was not in full use on my 1080i tv but they were still pretty good. What made it great was that it was all uncut and unedited. There is a little bit of filler and stuff but its not too bad. It was awesome seeing it uncut because there is so much violence that adult swim did not show. One of the main characters Mugen..i guess thats how you spell it...his voice is a little different i think and he is not edited what so ever so he seems more of a bad ass because he doesnt care what anyone thinks of him and he uses very vulger language. This is definatly worth the price. The only problem i found was the picture quality but it probably looks better in 1080p.
5,"Funky, Sweet Samurai Animae","A pure animae joy. Hot martial arts, hip hop funkiness and an interesting trio made this series addictive. Excellent drawing and action kept the story engaging. Don't hesitate to watch."
3,Familiar Strangers,"All in all I find the book too detached from the reality of the Gypsy people. It is above all an academic book, and it is the human side of the Gypsies that is so captivating to those who know them. In many ways they are more innocent, more caring, than non-Gypsies. Some of that she describes when she tells about Roma attitudes towards animals. Still, for those who know nothing about Gypsies/Roma I do recommend the book. Sonia Meyer"
2,charitable but not very reliable,"Sway attempts to be fair to the people known as ""gypsies,"" with the result that she overlooks behavior that may contribute to the problems they face everywhere. In her efforts to make their behavior conform to questionable sociological theories, she fails to view gypsy life objectively and, therefore, helpfully. Information about these fascinating people is always difficult to authenticate. This book is especially questionable."
2,Asus motherboards stink (for me.),"Every Asus mobo i ever got (at least 4 of them), they all bomb. Usually, it's a finicky issue, like 1 time, they couldn't recognize my dvd IDE drives. Their tech support told me it was cuz my #2 dvd drive was LG (Asus doesn't like LG.) Then, another time, their tech support guy said, Asus didn't like my super cool best-of-them-all Antec power supply/ brand new, 550watts, modular, top of the line, Antec NeoHE 550 psu. Another time, i bought a new router by Linksys, and Asus stopped doing wireless, after half hour. Another time, the Asus AMI bios bombed altogether. Asus boasts about greatness in overclocking, but i got darn good, super good results, and 100% reliable results, from X38 Gigabyte boards. Buy a good mobo, and you will have a good time. This Asus board is p35 anyway, so it's old by now. I don't recommend Asus."
1,Disappointed Does Not Stick to the Package,Very disappointed in Avery's new Trueblock Technology Shipping Labels - does not stick to the package - by the time I got to UPS all four corners were lifting off the package -- sent a note to Avery on the Contact Us webpage -- their answer -- PRESS HARDER. Does not help -- few minutes later the corners were lifting again. Had to tape it down. Thumbs Down!
5,Great for printing shipping labels on eBay or whatever.,"Avery makes lots of great products, but these self sticking full sheet labels are great for printing shipping labels with both addresses and postage printed on one label. I use them all the time with items I sell on eBay."
2,World Championship Poker,"This was a gift for my husband. He already has Sega Casino and enjoys that game, I thought this one might be more realistic, but it's not. He says it is ok, but has only since played it once."
2,World Championship Poker Deluxe,Would be nice to be able to decide how many other players you want to play against. Too slow.
2,Make Your Own,"I guess this product is OK if you don't mind spending money and don't want to take a few minutes time to make your own templates.Cutting crown isn't difficult with a crown jig like the one Bench Dog makes, but it's still easy to make a wrong cut because you're cutting ""upside down and backwards"". Templates definitely help prevent mistakes. I made my own templates out of scrap the first time I did crown molding."
3,purchacer not user,this product was purchased for my son to use. I received it one day and he picked it up at my home the next. Hopefully once he has practiced with it enough I will see the benefits.
4,Priceless tool for crown installation,"I suppose you could easily make a set yourself, but these are inexpensive and virtually unbreakable. They are a great reference before you cut expensive trim to confirm that your miter saw is set to the correct angle/tilt. I did deduct 1 star because they come with large print labels that you place on the templates yourself, which provides the opportunity for them to get placed on the wrong template. If they were already affixed it would avoid the possibility for this mistake to happen. Better yet they could have embossed it into the templates so unlike the labels you would not have to worry about them fading away or coming off (which would also save the company the cost of labels!). All-in-all worth the purchase despite this minor shortcoming"
5,Sanity saver!,"Teaching myself to do crown molding almost drive me to drink! I made a couple of rough patterns. They helped me know if I was about to make my cut backwards, but these are much better. I can now make sure I also get the correct angle, not just the correct direction. Just pay close attention when you put the stickers on each piece. I think this product would have been better if they came labeled, but it is a small price to pay to stay sane."
2,POOR PRODUCT DESCRIPTION,"I WAS NOT EXACTLY PLEASED. I ASSUMED THAT EVERYTHING SHOWN IN THE PICTURES CAME WITH THE TEMPLATES. SHAME ON ME. THERE IS NO ANGLE FINDING TOOL, OR BOOKLET / ANGLE REFERENCE TABLE. THE INSTRUCTIONS EVEN REFERENCE THE BOOKLET SHOWN BUT NOT INCLUDED AND NOT STATED. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND FIND A GOOD ANGLE FINDING TOOL WITH A GOOD ANGLE TABLE REFERENCE. I WILL REMOVE MY POOR REVIEW WHEN THE SELLER REMOVES OR MAKES IT PLAIN TO SEE THAT NOT ALL PRODUCTS SHOWN ARE INCLUDED WITH PURCHASE."
3,Templates,Works well for the job it was used to do and make the task easier. Also helps to get the job done quicker and accurate.
5,Completely restores my faith in death metal.,"This is a towering, monumental achievement. I haven't heard the other two albums, but this is a colossal disc. I was so taken with my Emperor and Marduk cds, I almost completely ignored death metal. This takes what bands like Sepultura used to do, along with Deicide, and beats it all to hell. Incredible blast beat drumming, killer low to midrange death vocals and some of the best guitar soloing ever. Production sucks, so what, get it, you'll get the point."
4,Scamalot,"Leakless is made from diecast metal , very durable. The design is interesting and authentic to the tree seconds this random racecar was in the movie. Most children are not interested in the backround characters. This ""REINACTING THE MAIN SCENES"" mess drains kids of their mental abiltiy to think for themselves. The parents of every country that this mediocre movie has been displayed have been going to Walmart and Target at one a.m. or whenever the second the stores open to get theese for their spoiled rotten kids. Do not get your children involved in cars if you hate to make your little angels suffer a little unimediate gratification."
4,GRINDCORISH HC CRUST,"These dudes are a brit anarcho-hardcore crust band from the 80's.Since the cd makes no reference at all about what records or years are these songs from,and the title does'nt match any of the 3 lp's and several ep they put out,my guess is that this is a kind of best of.Excellent drumming by Wag,later of Sick On The Bus fame,and blazing ,dinamic guitarwork featuring many a soloThese 18 track,33'+ collection of ultra heavy,racous as hell songs is so good I was partially deaf after a while.Oh ! the sound is very good too.No longer available in the USA,but dirt cheap if you get it used from Amazon uk."
3,park and sun packing,"the actual toy will be given as a birthday gift and has not been opened yet. i just wanted to comment on the awful way it was packed. shame on you, very cheap and not really usable."
1,Waste of (little) money,"Purchased, then returned, this book several months ago while trying to expand my engineering reference library. At first glance the breadth of the text seemed passable, but after paging through it for a couple of days I realized that this book is just a collection of formulae and very few diagrams, with nearly no technical discussion at all.For a book slightly larger in dimensions than the ""toolbox-sized"" Machinery's Handbook, this book is all white space and very little information save for pages and pages of mathematical proofs of equations (which are fine when you're in school, but not when you're a practicing engineer)."
1,Broken in two days!,"EXTREMELY disappointed in this product! 1. No volume control, 2. The very thin antenna wire broke off on the second day -- and I only wore it twice for 30 minutes walking the dog in the morning.I have now ordered a Lobeman. At least it has a two position volume control. I would never have ordered the Sportline product if I'd known there was no volume adjustment.Sportline should add a rubber flex boot for a quarter inch or so where the antenna wire passes through the case so that this isn't such a terrible and immediate point of failure."
1,"Piece of junk, DON'T ORDER!!!","This item is a piece of junk. It does not even have a volume control!?! Horrible reception. Made of flimsy plastic. It came with dead batteries, and the batteries (LR44) cost more for two than I paid for the item itself. With online ordering, I guess you win some & you lose some. This item is a big ripoff, DON'T ORDER IT !!!"
2,No Volume control,"I puchered three of these thinking I could use them at the football game. They dont tell you in the ad that they DONT HAVE VOLUME CONTROL! It would be great for Walking of which its intent is, but I used it for One football game and the batterys went deed. I threw it in the trash out side the game!1Bubba1"
3,Mini Ear Radio,"Very light and comfprtable to wear. No volume control is a weak feature. Sound is OK. Only good for listening to strong local stations. Since it only fits in 1 ear, there is obvioulsy no stereo. Cute little gadget."
4,Practical Advice,"Practical Advice on many issues of running a household in an environmentally friendly way. Some of the suggestions on living ""green"" I would not personally use, but the book is a great starting point for making your home greener."
1,terrible,no topless with bad actors and it was not funny. Priced way too high for garbage like this. check out the 12 movie set girls guns and g-strings. it has constant good boobs and action
5,more debbie rochon please,bikini bloodbath christmas is the 3rd movie in this series the 1st wsa good but killed off debbie rochon to early the 2nd was a great horror/comedy debbie last till the end this one has less debbie and recycled nude scenes from the first two movies
4,GRE Prep Aid,"I began studying with this test prep guide about 6 weeks before the exam. I studied up to three hours a night, covering the basic sections and dipping into the advanced sections, albeit minimally. I made note cards for vocabulary words I was not familiar with (and words whose meanings I did not know). In addition, I borrowed a friend's copy of Barron's Pass Key To The GRE, which is a slimmed-down version of the book I am reviewing. They did their job; I amassed a composite score of 1200 (no word on my essays yet).There is a CD that accompanies this book. ***Do NOT buy this guide simply because of the CD!!*** While there are computer-adaptive tests to practice with, many of the questions/reading passages are repeated.For the price of the books that Barron's offers, they are valuable study helpers. Stay committed to preparing for the test and you will have little to worry about. Best wishes to you."
3,Typos!!!,"I purposley didn't buy Kaplan's book because of all the reported typos reported by Amazon readers who wrote reviews on the book. Most recommended Barrons, so I bought Barrons.. and what did I find? TYPOS!!!!! Typos in math=not good.Other than that, the tips are wonderful. The explanations are a bit vague, so I would recommend you use the practice tests to study how to solve problems, because the example problems they use DO NOT match the following test problems and are impossible to answer, unless you remember everything from high school, which I didn't. Just use the practice test problems to figure out how to DO the problem, then take a sample test off the CD or at the GRE official Website. Take as many sample tests as you can possibly stand. I have found that to be MUCH more beneficial. Good luck!!"
4,"Great, but a little over the top","Based on reviews from previous buyers and recommendations on this site, I purchased this book.The review was excellent, and the tips and techniques were well laid out and easy to understand. I did well on the GRE itself, but I felt that I was overprepared in some areas and would've benefited from more preparation in some other areas.The math review was extremely extensive and much more involved, detailed, and complex than what was on the exam. The verbal review was very good, but I think I could've used even more time there than in the math.Overall, I was very pleased and don't need to retake the GRE. I just wish I'd focused more on the verbal and less on the math. I did not have to take the written portion of the exam, so I cannot speak to that portion of the review."
1,Don't Buy This Book!!,"I am re-taking the GRE in October and I have used many different study guides. I recently bought the Barron's book because of the well-known status of the name. If you are not a Math GENIUS, don't buy this book. I consider myself to be very good in math, but I haven't taken a math class in a few years. This book FAILS to adequately explain the answers. If anything, I am EXTREMELY more confused than I was before I opened up this book. It has been nothing but a waste of my time and energy. The only thing this book has succeeded in doing is making me feel frustrated and less confident about my Math skills. Also, the material in this book is much different than the other study guides I have used. I HIGHLY recommend the KAPLAN REVIEW BOOK & GRE TEST FOR DUMMIES!!! They both explain the answers to the practice tests very well and you feel like you really understand the material!!"
5,good buy,"Good book that makes one feel confident if you have to take the test. I bought this, but never got around to taking the test, however it does prepare you for it."
3,Good for the money I spend,Used extensively. But it was damn cheap. Cd is good source. Bought for wife.she was not happy since it was looking old.
4,GRE prep,"I have no complaints about the book. I believe it may be helpful. However, I have a major complaint about the seller. One of the most important exercises in GRE preparation is the use of interactive tests. The enclosed CD was broken. When I emailed the seller about that, he claimed that he had already informed me, which I doubt, but since I do not recall. I will not elaborate on it. My issue is with his matter-of-fact reponse. If it were me, I would apologize and send the customer a new CD or a partial refund."
2,"Looks good, but not effective for good score","It is really unfortunate to hard to see a good GRE textbook. This textbook looks good and provides some good strategies, but in real test, it is not that helpful because the strategies are too complicated and also too divisive to apply them in a short time. Nevertheless, one recommendable part is vocabulary section even though it is not complete. Personally I think that this part is the best part among all GRE section. However, software is really junk. I got more than 730 in the text of CD, but in real test I received less 550. Especially sentence completion part is not that easy going in real test. I did not look at the math section because I am not worry about my math (because of my major). So I cannot tell anything about the math section. I feel that the math is getting harder in CBT."
4,Good Resource,"Could use more tests and exercises, as well as supplementary flashcards for the vocabulary words, but other than that, it's a great tool for review."
4,"Great textbook, but bad software.","No doubd that this is the BEST TEXTBOOK out there, but I was quite disappointed with the software.Although there is one CAT on the cd, that is all you get. The diagnostic test is THE SAME as the one in the textbook, and the tutorials and guides do not offer much either.If you want ""get used to the question formats"", download the powerprep free sofware from the website of ETS.If you want a nice prep software (with many tests and exercises), go for the one of Kaplan GRE Exam 2004 with CD-ROM... though their textbook is much worse than barron's."
4,Really good overview of the GRE,"I don't have anything to compare this to, but since I never took the SATs I really had no background to taking the GRE. This book was easy to work with and I feel like it is preparing me pretty well. Easy to understand and lots of words for the verbal part which is my weakest part. The tips it gives you are easy to remember and have helped me a lot to answer some of the more difficult questions. The CD Rom gives a more relistic testing situation, so I would recommend a book and CD combo.Overall this book was really useful, and I would recommend it for others."
5,Very useful book,"I prepared for the GRE General exam using only this book, and I am very satisfied with the results. The best part about this book is the extensive vocabulary review section: they have identified 300 words that they feel occur very often on GRE exams. I definitely think that reviewing the vocabulary section of the Barron's book helped me answer a few questions that I otherwise would not have known.I didn't open the CD-ROM though so I have no idea how helpful that is. If you are studying to take the GRE, I highly recommend going to the GRE's own website and downloading their PowerPrep software in addition to buying this book. That software includes two full GRE tests and a few hundred separate practice problems; unfortunately I did not download it until the day before the exam so I didn't get to use all of its practice tools. Additionally, for the essay portion of the test, they have a few sample prompts and sample responses, so you can see the level of writing they are looking for."
3,a bit overrated,"i think the layout for the math section in this book is quite awful. i've always been pretty solid at math, and it was not user-friendly at all. verbal - the vocab list is quite massive, and if you have time to learn all the words, great. if not, at least learn the top 300 (and mix and match vocab lists between here [top 300 words, not the 3,500 list], princeton review, kaplan, and arco). the diags in the book, along w/ the CD were pretty good. the verbal is pretty accurate, but the math is harder than the real test. my verbal scores from barron's were around what i got on the actual exam, but my math score was higher on the real thing by a little bit. best combo in my opinion is PR and kaplan for technique, barron's for the vocab, and kaplan and barron's for realistic (albeit harder) sample tests."
4,"Mac users, beware","Overall, I'm finding this book very well organized and easy to use. However, one of the reasons I picked this guide over others was because of the practice computer adaptive tests included on the CD-ROM in the back.However, I have a Mac, and one without anything lower than OSX on it, at that. The CD-ROM requires Mac Classic for the practice tests, and for obvious reasons, I'm leery of installing a mostly-defunct OS on my computer.I tried to figure out whether or not this would be a problem before I bought, but wasn't able to get a straight answer. So, Mac users, now you know -- this program hasn't quite made the jump to the current Mac OS!"
2,Big Useless Book for a COMPUTER-BASED Exam,"Do not be fooled by the lure of ""six full length model tests."" The tests are in paper form. Barron's is a very paper-heavy book. You will get more practice through Kaplan's test prep as they have many computer-based exams."
2,At least there aren't any mistakes on the cover.,"Are all GRE prep books this poorly written? If so, how exactly does anyone ever manage to do well on these tests?This book is full of spelling errors, usage errors, and loads of incorrectly scored answers. Every time I sit down to study with it I find more and more problems. The Math section is particularly rediculous. Steps are skipped, numbers are introduced from nowhere, and answers seem to just be made up from some writer's imagination. There's very little in the way of explanation given, yet nearly a page is spent on such advanced subjects like ""Draw a diagram when you need to"" or ""Use scratch paper to solve answers.""Don't even bother with this one. It's the first I've tried, so I can't recommend anything better."
1,I ordered it before 1 month ago but i have not yet got it now,Why am not got it . I am very angry. return back my money . reply my question
3,This product was okay.,"The questions you will face on the GRE will be much harder, but this book and the accompanying CD do provide a good overview of the style of questions you will see on the GRE."
2,Didn't produce desired result,"I bought this as well as a few other books in an effort to raise my verbal score. I gave myself 6 weeks to get ready for the test and devoted most evenings to study.End result -- my score dropped 10 points. I'm now somewhat convinced that there's a only a limited amount of preparing one can do for the computer-based GRE. The previous time, I only studied a few days."
3,Lackluster math review,"Frankly, I am suprised that the quantitative review does not delve deeper into actual arithmetic, algebra, and geometry that would be so helpful for this test. The guide's fixation on drawing diagrams to scale is laughable. Would one really expect a person under stress of an actual test to sit there accurately drawing triangles (the book suggests using sheets of scrap paper to make sure lines come out exactly straight)? It isn't easier to review the rules of basic geometry? Using this source, it's no shock that many find the actual GRE math portion so different from test prep. The book is mildly useful as a bank of test questions, but for review of concepts, stick with something else."
2,"Verbal OK, Aweful Math","This book's verbal section is well organized and will definitely help you in the real GRE's. However, Mr. Barron clearly has no understanding of the GRE Math. The graph questions are simply aweful and do not reflect the real GRE questions whatsoever. Moreover, the grammer on Math questions is extremely sloppy, often leading to obvious confusions about what the questions ask. If you are trying to score perfect on the math like I am, this book will only frustrate you with its consistenly aweful graph questions and grammer ambiguities."
2,"UNFORTUNATELY, NOT THE BEST QUARTET","The music on this release is meandering and uninspired...too much violin, not enough guitar. I really don't know what the appeal of a violin on a jazz album, especially with 2 other stringed instruments, has for some but for me it's grating. If you want to hear some INVOLVING quartet music, try the 1st quartet from the 70s (QUARTET, ARCADE or M) which unfortunately ECM, maddeningly, refuses to re-issue on CD (strangely, a gap in Abercrombie's catalog that may remain that way). Some of them can be found on Japanese imports but at premium prices. WHY? Who knows but John's in a rut here ... for some exciting recent Abercrombie, try STRUCTURES, a trio release from '06. Otherwise, pass on this."
4,Nice looking watch with a PURPLE face.,"The face is technically blue but really looks purple. We saw it in a store and loved the purple face. It was cheaper online. It does look blue in some light but mostly it's purple. Don't buy it unless you are ok with it looking purple. The band contours to the actual face of the watch so it's one continuous piece. it's a BIG watch and has some weight to it. Don't buy it for a small man, it might overwhelm his arm."
1,AVOID--Toshiba is horrible,"Just spent 9 months arguing with Toshiba about a bad bulb. Warranty: 90 days, bulb lasted 100 (210 hours). After an exhaustive discussion and numerous 90 mile jaunts to different ""authorized"" (which turned out to not be but were referred to me by Toshiba) I was told...""tough luck, we are so sorry but you are out of warranty"" I am writing this after getting off the phone with them and am still livid but think everyone should know that Toshiba should be avoided.Jamison Holt"
3,Nice Music to go with that Java!,"Gary Farr has been producing this recording for 6 years. In between recordings, he's made his work available to the folks at The Weather Channel for their ""Weather on the 8's"" segments. He's finally managed to get the finished project to be published. The result is an esoteric mix of original tunes. Like a pot of freshly brewed coffee, Farr delivers his listeners something to give them a pick me up for the day. My personal favorite track was ""You Love Me"" with its moody and easy sound. Overall, the CD is a nice dose of lively tunes that will keep you going all day. Good CD!!"
3,some truly great work from Wino's 2nd greatest band,"this release is a compilation that collects songs from the Spirit Caravan's 2 full length albums, their first and last 7"" singles, and a couple unreleased tracks. the digital remastering sounds great - lots of clarity and a slight boost in the levels. this 2-CD set in my opinion is proof that Wino is truly one of the greatest post-Hendrix rock guitarists alive today. Spirit Caravan may not ever achieve the cult status of Saint Vitus or Obsessed, but Wino's level of heart and soul in his playing with S.C. is certainly matched with anything else he's ever done in his career, past or future."
2,garish colors,I received the Pfaltzgraff Pistoulet 20 piece dinnerware set. The colors on the website and box were a lovely pastel. As I unpacked the dishes I was more and more dismayed as the colors were nothing like the box. I have hidden away the large plates. The colors are hard to look at. I love the large sunflower bowls and smaller bowls. Not the colors though. So.... if you want pastels don t order these dishes.
3,Color not as described,"I was very excited to receive my 3 sets of this dinnerware. Imagine my surprise when the described ""red"" rimmed dinner plates are actually a bright pink! I know you can't rely on monitors to relay the correct color, so I went by the picture AND description. So disappointed. My kitchen walls are a deep red and this just completely clashes. Being returned for sure!"
5,Whole (ADULT) family pleased!,Excellent high quality set! I was so pleased that I bought another set to make up service for 12.
2,Very Disappointed,"I ordered the 40 piece set and only received 20! One of the plates was broken. Got disconnected from Customer Service once, and then spoke with another individual. Very hard to understand both--thick accents. Just wanted to know where the other 20 pieces were and to see if I had to return the whole box or just the one plate. Was told had to return the whole box. Don't know how I'm going to get the items back in the box. Very difficult to unpack. Ordered for Thanksgiving and neither of them could guarantee that they would arrive by then. Will not order from Amazon again. Poor customer service and packaging."
5,Great Education For Beginning Quilters,"This is a beginner's guide for quilting, but even an experienced quilter can benefit from this book! Complete patterns for darling houshold items and gifts are included, with EASY TO FOLLOW instructions for completing your projects. The chapter on baby gifts is especially cute. This book is a must-have for the quilting ambitious."
3,Signal Locator,"I did not find this very easy to use. I was able to eventually able to locate a signal, but it is not as powerful as the pro versions. It takes a little time and patience."
2,false signals,"skip this; I get way too many false signals, it has not proven to work for me. I'm not faulting the manufacturer or seller but I wouldn't recommend it."
3,"Good, but not enough information","This book is a good way to get one's feet wet with Mormonism. I really liked it. However, it breezes over polygamy and doesn't give a clear view of womens' roles in the LDS Church. I would recommend reading this book with American Apocrypha and looking up information on the ""September Six"" before deciding whether or not to become a Saint. Do not let the church tell you what you should and should not read. If they truly are a ""true"" church, then they shouldn't worry about any of their potential members reading potentially ""anti-Mormon"" material."
1,"Inaccurate, whitewashed view of important American Religion","The editors of this book really dropped the ball. The history and practices of the LDS church are glossed over in naive and sometimes patently untrue ways in this book--though the information does seem to adhere to the approved LDS version of the church (I think--I'm not certain, since I'm not LDS myself). I'm appalled, frankly. I think the editors of a reference guide have an obligation to check the accuracy of information in their books. As an informal student of religion, even *I* could spot the problems here.It's a shame too, because the history and organization of the church is complicated to an outsider and I was looking for a clear, simple guide. Mormonism is an important movement in American religious history--we deserve real history, not a chipper, whitewashed version.""Mormon America"" is a better book, though it is not a quick guide in any sense."
1,Biased and full of faulty information,"I generally assume that ""Dummy"" and ""Idiot"" books are written objectively. I would have never imagined, though, that one would be written as an apologetic for a particular religion as this book appears to be. The author, who is a Mormon, does his best to make Mormonism look like just another Christian denomination. (One place he says it's a misnomer to say that Mormons are not Christians. Yet he never explains which ""Christian"" doctrines that Mormons believe.) This book might be enjoyed by Mormons who think that it supports their faith and possibly could lead the uneducated into inviting Mormon missionaries to their homes. But to those who have studied this religion, it is nothing more than a polemic attempting to make Mormonism look mainstream when, in fact, it isn't."
4,the best of the casefiles,"I've only read the first fifty or so Casefiles, but this one was the best. Frank and Joe discover a company that specializes in helping criminals disappear from the police. There are some great thrills and cliffhanger chapters in this one, plus a lot of suspense as the Hardy Boys slowly uncover the scope of the operation."
