2,Question,"What is that song that's playing in the background of the preview? It's like ""breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out"" and I think it mentioned Timbaland..not sure though. Couldn't ifnd it on teh soundtrack. Thanks."
4,very helpful! full of great ideas.,I thumbed through this book at my mom's house and knew I wanted to buy it. It's full of helpful hints and great ideas. It's very interesting!
4,Good for the price,"These knobs are great and very shiny and nice; however, I was surprised by how thin they were. They definitely add a polished modern look to plain cabinets though for a very small price."
1,Not a very good shovel.,"The metal strip on this shovel catches on the brushed sidewalk concrete, and the shovel itself is too flimsy. So every time the metal blade catches, the shovel flexes and all progress halts. The angle of attack seems all wrong. I'm not tall, but I find myself lowering the handle to try to get the blade to work.Don't be lured in by price point. Choose a different shovel and you won't dread the snow."
4,Great shovel for the price,"I was a little hesitant when purchasing this shovel since the only other review was negative. However, given that it only cost $9 plus free shipping I had to give it a try (besides there have not been any snow shovels in our area for a while). I was pleasantly surprised and it definitely gets the job done! It seems to be high quality. I have smooth asphalt so the edge of the blade getting stuck on the pavement is not an issues. It is definitely better than some of the shovels I have been borrowing from neighbors and the next most inexpensive shovel on Amazon was about $24 when you included shipping."
1,WORST SNOW SHOVEL I'VE EVER HAD,"I'll be short and to the point. This is the worst shovel I've ever purchased. After using it a handful of times, the metal edge on the end of the shovel began to peel off. Without this strip, the shovel will not work as it gets stuck to the surface, sidewalk, driveway, etc. You actually have to lift the shovel up in order to remove any snow or ice and it won't pick up what's left. Its like jabbing the shovel directly into the concrete and not going anywhere. Without this metal strip, the shovel is worthless. In addition, I purchased it at PEP Boys and I just noticed on my receipt it cannot be returned. At $13.99 plus tax its not expensive but it isn't worth the money or aggravation either. Its a nice looking shovel but the looks are deceiving. If you can find one, get a more reliable shovel even if you have to pay a little more."
2,Cute but short on believability,"This was a cute book but by no means was it ""great literature."" The book kept switching tenses which made me feel like I had multiple personalities. The plot was thin but was okay if you want fluff. The Count in the story was not a man I would dream of for a knight in shining armor...more like rusted creaky armor. He was shallow and not well developed at all. I would not suggest this book as a must read, should read, or might read. However, it's okay as a ""Put me to sleep at night"" read."
1,Save your money,"The CD function stopped working after a few months and the tuner is an absolute hair trigger - hitting it by accident closing the shower curtain this morning moved it more than 3MHz!To avoid the problem the other reviewer notes concerning it falling, I untied one end of the rope that allows it to hang. I looped that around the shower curtain and retied it. That lets the cord act as a safety line for when the suction fails."
5,Works Great!,My son really enjoys this product. He was always ruining portable cd players in the bathroom and this isn't getting ruined.
5,So cute!,"We have a whale themed nursery and I just had to have this lamp when I saw it! It's even cuter in person. I was a little worried the yellow of the shade would be too bright, but it's actually a yellow and white gingham pattern (which I couldn't tell on my computer) and looks softer in person to me. Love it!"
3,Good Lot.,"It had a lot of mixed jewelry, and it was good for the price. However quite a few of the rings were too small for my lip D:Still a good buy, and I got a bar, 2 captive ball rings, belly piercing, a few studs. Love the stud that changes color in the light and had a spiked end!"
4,Nice product...but unknown gauges,"The jewelry itself seems clean and nicely kept. My only problem is that the ""Mixed Lot"" literally means the pieces are mixed. You get the kind shown...but they don't tell you a gauge. I sent a message asking them, and all they could tell me was that the lot was selected at random, so they didn't know the gauge... =/4 out of 5 because fast shipping and nice responce to message, minus 1 for selling unknown gauge of jewelry."
1,Mix body piercing jewelry,This item was so cheep I will never buy this agin the belly button ring was miss the jewel as well
1,Do NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!,"This is possibly the WORST compilation I have ever purchased. As a long time City Boy fan I am disgusted by the exclusions of such classics as ""Mr. Shoes"", ""Summer in the Schoolyard"", ""Moving in Circles"", ""Machines"", ""Cigarrettes"", ""Mama's Boy"", ""The Man Who Ate His Car"" just to name a few!!!!! The liner notes are completely wrong from the albums the songs came from to the personell on each album. I wonder if the band even knows about this release. The cover isn't even new. It's the ""Young Men Gone west"" artwork. Don't waste your money on this poor excuse for a City Boy ""Anthology"".....you can't call this poor representation of one of the greatest bands to come out of the '70's an anthology. Call it a ripoff!!!"
2,different strokes for different folks,"There is (generally) a reason why bands do not get famous... they were simply not that good to begin with!I saw City Boy warm up for UFO, it was not a good pairing. I did not care for them and teh UFO crowd did not give them a warm welcome.5-7-0-5 did get a decent amount of airplay (at least where I grew up in Chicago) in the 1970's. The song was okay.I bought this purely for the nostalgic aspect of being able to hear a song from my youth. I do not care for the other songs.If City Boy was a favorite of yours then you were definelty in the minority. During their heyday, I did not see a lot of black rock concert t-shirts with ""City Boy"" on them!"
3,Obsolete,"I was silly and bought this for my DSLR. Obviously, you don't need this when shooting digital, as you can directly work with the color channels in post. Gave it the stars because its Nikon and its well made, but I haven't touched a film camera in years so I can't really say how it works in any practical sense. I'm sure it's just fine, but again, no need in the digital world."
5,Aquarium Sheer Fun - No Work,"Often we need a relaxing respite with no personal effort involved, just for a break from the hectic routine. I found it in this video. I remember how relaxing it once was to watch the fish in our tank when we were able to maintain an aquarium in our living room. Now, there's no time for that. But this video allows us the relaxation without the work or the worry of taking care of the fish. Oh, the music is great. We are enjoying it!"
5,soothing seascapes is like an environmental massage,My grandmother is in a nursing home with lots of sadness surrounding her. She is always anxious. I brought her this DVD and she loves it. She said it makes her feel calm and relaxed. So I think of it as an environmental massage. I will certainly think of The Soothing Seacapes DVD as a great gift to those in Rehab or in a nursing home. It is so serene and full of God's beautiful creations of nature. Thanks so much for such great photography.I would recommend this DVD to all who love nature and need a way to relax.Soothing Seascapes from The Florida Aquarium
2,Disjointed writing by academics who are not educators,You have to get to page 99 to find an explanation of how to implement the algorithm. That explanation is much like the preceding material. A meandering outpouring of facts without much regard for consistency or clarity and an unnecessary tendency to over complicate. Caters to the research community at the expense of clarity to the student.The authors need to explain the algorithm first in clear and simple terms - then they can talk about optimizations!!! There is no point telling me how to optimize something you haven't fully explained.The consequence of the approach in this book is that finding out useful practical information becomes ordeal by treasure hunt. For example. Try finding an explanation for the derivation of the parameter for pheromome update. There's a nice greek symbol for it and it's between 0 and 1 but er..... thats it.If these guys are professors I pity their students.
4,Great Case,"I really adore this case. Its a beautiful red that cleans fairly easily. My RAZR fits in snugly and is very secure if dropped (which I do pretty often). The only drawback is that the corners of the RAZR may take a little damage if dropped. Otherwise, an excellent buy!"
5,Great CD player for cars,"I got this CD player as a gift from my Dad and he installed it for me too, I loved it very much.Very good quality. I enjoed having it veru much until it was stolen from my car, although you can remove the face and put it in a special box that comes with it but I didn't use it. Now I'm going to buy it for myself this time.[...]"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,Unfortunately I purchased this item From NetGift and it arrived all dusty and the sails had fallen off. It took me 2 hrs to clean the inside with tweezers and Cotton. This item is not worth one cent considering the aggravation that you will go through in the end.
4,Quality matches price,Nice decoration. It will look nice on a mantle or bookshelf. It is not modeled after any particular ship. Quality of product is to be expected based on price. Shipped promptly.
3,"Melodramatic, Bizzare, Trashy, but Funny","The characters in these two movies are all strange and revolting people. Each scene gets progressively more foul, but never fails to stop surprising you. For some reason, the ""out-there"", obscene humor will make you let out a few belly laughs. After watching both of these movies, which is enough to make your genitalia shrivel and your mind ill, I questioned if there was anything actually redeeming in these films. The answer was no. But the damage was done: some of these horrors stick in your head for a long while.Oh yeah-- don't expect to take anything away from these movies-- except some visual images of fat crossdressers shoving T-Bones in their cooches."
1,Cult it is NOT!!,"So, in a nutshell...don't bother wasting your time like I did. To make a movie about bad taste and think that it will eventually become a cult is about as dumb as voting for G W Bush and thinking that he will usher in the second coming of Christ. Yeh, right! Left or Right....there are better things to do with your time."
4,a movie brimming with cinematic firsts !,"A guy, a girl , a chicken & a toolshed. Sounds like a deranged version of ""Three's company"". After watching this movie, Jerry Springer will seem like wholesome entertainment. How much you enjoy this may depend on your mood & what you had for supper.Of course, the guy with the flexible sphincter in the party scene still makes me cringe. I would like to play this movie at a nun convention & see what happens :) Excellent soundtrack !!!"
1,"DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME","This game takes horrible to a new level! On a 1-5 scale I give it a -9999999. The graphics are bad, spiderman's and everyone else's moves are limited, the sound effects are....(lets not even go there) and the game is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. You would get frustrated, you would be ripping your hair out......... basically your life will get miserable. You will keep loosing no matter how hard you try. Even if you use a game genie. WHO THE HELL DESIGNED THIS VIDEO GAME? I WOULD LOVE TO KNOCK THEM OUT!!!!!!!!!"
1,Big Ben Baby Crown,"This clock is junk. Just try to turn the alarm on or off. I purchased this clock expecting to get the historical ""Baby Ben/Big Ben"" quality."
5,Haunting,"I watched this film a couple of months ago and it is still on my mind. It was riveting, I didn't want it to end.So many issues were touched upon. It is a must for all who care about rescue regardless of what country we live in. My heart goes out to the people interviewed. The trauma of their experiences will stay with them for the rest of their lives."
3,Great Intro book --- Great book if your first of second the topic,"I've read a lot of books and material on these topics. This books seems right on and well written, and I would recommend it to anyone starting out. But, it didn't grab me -- probably more due to having read more than enough on these topics and my interests being elsewhere. Once again, great book for getting started on taking responsibility for your own health."
4,footwear,"Not exactly as i expected down to the last detail but, I am very much satisfied. The delivery was on time, the fit was amazingly accurate and best of all the product was very much impressive. It could even pass as the MRAP of the shoe world!"
5,These Docs Rock!!,I've always loved wearing Doc Martens for the simple reason that they are very comfortable and are have a great longevity without wearing out. I've worn these actual doc marten oxfords to paintaball warzones and they felt like I was wearing steeltoe sneakers. Truely the best brand of shoes worldwide.
2,Didn't last,"After going through a few pairs of cheaper ""Oxford"" style shoe, I decided to spend the money on these for work. I am a manager at a factory, about 50/50 desk vs. on the floor. When I'm on the floor I want oil resistant and steel toe. In the office, something that doesn't look like a workboot. These fit the build, until I wore them every day for the last 6 months. I bought them in July 2011.Right around Thanksgiving, I had to replace the insoles with Dr. Scholls. Not a big deal, I'm a big guy and usually replace insoles at least once. Now it's January, and the shoes are breaking down. Inside on the sole base, are cracks and wrinkles where the shoe flexes when I walk. I can feel this through the insoles and the shoes are becoming uncomfortable.The tread is about 60% worn and the leather and lace both seem to be holding up, but the basic construction of the sole is just not what I expected out of a pair of Docs."
1,SOOOO Heavy,"I previously had Dr. Marten oxford shoes and loved them. Decided to try these and it was a huge disappointment. Its really heavy and bulky. Co-workers complimented on how badass they look but its super heavy. The material they used also rips very easy, I had several cuts around the toe area with only 1 month of use."
5,Perfect for Warehouse Work,"My occupation required that I wear these steel toes when I am on the warehouse floor. Instead of getting a cheap pair at Sears, I opted to purchase these Doc Martens. What a great decision I made! Theses shoes are extremely comfortable and double as a great casual work shoe when in the offices. Be mindful these are heavy and have at least an inch of rubber for a foundation. Therefore, people will hear you clunk around a typical office floor. If you are in the business of looking for steel toes, these are hands down the pair you should wear. I can say that after having at least 3 pairs that were incredibly uncomfortable."
4,Heavy,"This pre-seasoned skillet is perfect size for a couple of eggs or a piece of french toast. It works well as a non-stick alternative as long as you use some butter or oil to provide the lubricant. Otherwise, it will not perform like a teflon coated pan. It heats up quickly and stays warm. The handle is longer than most cast iron cookware but still gets hot if what you're cooking takes more than 15 minutes or so. The pan is heavy and probably best suited for a gas range. Although we use it on a glass top, some care needs to be taken because of the weight and rough finish of the pan."
4,An important book for everyone to read,"Feldt does an excellent job of showing how the pro-life/anti-choice agenda is not just about abortion, but is actually part of a broader plan to control reproduction according to extreme religious views. I was absolutely shocked to learn about some of the blatantly health hazardous actions the Bush administration has taken, affecting women and famililes in the U.S. and around the world very negatively. A must read for 2004."
1,Wish I could give this 0 stars,"I'm pro-choice, and thought this book would be interesting, but this woman comes across as an idiot. Feminism has really fallen on hard times if someone like this is supposed to be a spokesperson for women."
1,Unsafe item,"Item has aluminum vs. brass tabs and overheats, causing tabs to fuse to electrical receptacle and creating a serious fire hazard. Avoid at all cost."
5,Groovy jazz guitar,"Aleady here in 1990 one can say without any exxageration that Whitfield was a true groove master with no real technical restrictions and with what Wes Montgomery use to say.""a very nice definition"" in his single note lines.Whitfield is mostly using ""down picking"" that is what gives this nice definition..you can hear every note clearly even hwn he plays at the ""speed of lightning"".It refreshing to hear how Whitfield constructs his lines...like when he start of the dom 7th scale on the 6 th..it gives a nice lyrical touch to his playing.Even though Whitfield at times can be perceived as a ""speed demon"" he clearly comes out of the Grant Green-George Benson school"" where groove and swing was the essential thing, quite different to more modern players of today.Otherwise I ref to the very insightful review below by Tyler Smith."
5,Nephews Loved It,"This was a Christmas present so I didn't watch it but my nephews loved it. So, if they are happy, I am happy."
5,All in One Favorites for kids!,"This was a Christmas gift for my 3 year old grandaughter. She loves these T.V. shows & she learns a lot from them (she can count up to 10, knows all of her shapes & colors, knows the letters of the alphabet, can understand & speak some -a fairly good amount of- Spanish, her vocabulary is way above the level of a 3 year old, and she can read some words in books). She amazes a lot of people & they always ask where she learns these things. We feel she enjoys herself learning from her ""friends"" on T.V. She also has their books. I have a DVD player in my car & I have a selection of these shows on separate DVDs which she loves. Now she can see them all on 1 DVD (we use the DVD player in town & it's not always convenient to change a DVD when driving). This DVD will be especially good for the long trips we take (over 2 hours). Anyone with little ones will know how much education kids can absorb while watching something they enjoy! I highly recommend this DVD."
5,If you are interested in Religion this is for you,Beautifully written as all the works form Taylor Caldwell an unbelieviblyinspired. Apparently it was dictated to Taylor by Archangel Darios. I don't know but is the kind of dialogue that you cannot miss if you are interested in Religion
5,Just as described and shipped promptly,"I was please to find this hard to track down book. It was in perfect condition when I received it, still even having a protective plastic wrap on the book!"
4,Things that make you go Hmmmmm,"An unsettling novel which really gets your mental gears moving....it also provides an interesting framework for viewing events in the world today and forces you to ask yourself whether compromise is the best solution in some cases or whether such compromises lead to ""slippery slopes"" of unintended negative consequences which were brought about through good intentions."
1,Poor product....,"I needed a computer desk so after many hours of shopping online I though I found the perfect desk.... I read review of this product in ""[...]"" and it seemed that this was a descent product but....[...]2. Difficult assembly: I enjoy assembling furniture but this was no fun. Some of the screws don't even go into the holes, some of the screws are very small that it's difficult to place them in the holes; also as screws go in the pain comes off from the furniture.3. The rolling keyboard tray and the draw do not roll back smoothly. They need extra push to go in and make noise while moving.I do not recommend this product.This product is not worth the money."
3,Less than Mobile Computer Desk,"When I purchased this desk I believed that it came with four wheels. Only the back of the has wheels the front is fixed legs. So I'm not sure how they can call it mobile. Even empty it is not easy to move. Further part of the desk appears to have been previously used. The packaging was fine but the surfaces have many fine scratches in them. Durability is about what you would expect. The opening for the monitor appears to be only large enough for a 19inch. The drawer arrived with one of the slides broken, unrepairable. I have yet to go out and buy a replacement drawer glide. Overall it's not a bad desk, just not mobile as we need."
5,Great!,"Great desk for an older gentleman, placing all necessary components within reach. Assembly was easy and took less than an hour."
3,Techni-mobili desk,"Just so others know.Printer shelf is only big enough for the small printer shown in the pictures.a 22in. monitor will not fit under the printer with the wire rack installed.keyboard tray height will not fit an ergo split keyboard.with a standard PC on the side as shown, any addition weight on that side causes the whole unit to tilt over to the right!"
3,This book was pretty cool,"Although this is classified as an ""adult"" novel, I read it when I was 14 (Now I'm 15), and I understood it just fine. The plot is twisted, which gives it its charm. I found it entertaining mainly because it was unpredictable. This was not my favourite Christopher Pike book (I like the 1st ""Remember Me"" and the ""Final Friends"" books better), but I would still say that this book is better than books by any other author."
5,The Season of Passage,"This book was the best that I have ever read. I know the people reading this are getting sick of hearing "" Oh, it's sooo exellent. I loved the part where ... and then ... "" But, it's true. There is no way that you can understand how great this novel is until you've read it for yourself. Christopher Pike makes you fall in love with all of the characters, especially Jenny, Gary, Jim and Lauren. By the end of the book you will not be the same. The characters that Pike creates you will not want to let go. So, there's my review. If I still haven't convinced you that it's the best book that's ever written, read it for yourself and you'll know that I wasn't lying."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"This is one of the best books I,ve ever read. I can't say that it is the best because I hated Jennifer Wagner(Chaneen) and I think that she should've died insted of Lauren Wagner(Janier?). I think that it was her fault that Lauren and Janier died and the Sastra became mortals. Jennifer even say it while talking to Terry on the phone.(""From the beginning,"" she said sadly, ""it was my fault.""). I still loved this book even if the ending was a disaster."
2,Good story with mediocre writing,"I used to love Christopher Pike when I was in junior high, and read Chain Letter and Remeber Me and all his classics. So when someone told me he wrote adult fiction, I was quite excited.I really enjoyed the story; it was definitely a page turner. But otherwise the book was a disappointing, mostly from a writing standpoint. The dialogue was completely unbelieveable and the characters were underdeveloped and mostly two-dimensional. After a while, I had to suspend my writing critique and just read for the story, to find out what happened.One bonus is that despite its length, the book is a quick read. All told, it's not bad if you want a quick poolside- or beach- read, or if you just want to get absorbed in a novel for a few days."
1,The author is seriously ill.,"Everyone gets hurt or dies violently in Christopher Pikes books. I'm in high school, but if I had teens, I wouldn't encourage them to read this stuff. Books that make sense to me are HOLES by Louis Sachar, or The CHOCOLATE WARS, or SIGHTS by Susanna Vance. They have excitement without gore."
5,Unbelievable Storytelling,"I too, have grown up with Pike's books. This, by far is his best book. The way the story is so interwoven and complex is amazing. It truly invoked feelings of terror, heartbreak, suspense, and wonder as i turned the pages. I've read this book many times, and every time i read it, i can always find more details i never noticed. I would definately recommend it to anyone who is drawn to mystery, space, and legends."
5,This book is a wonderful work of art!,"The season of passage is the best book I have read in years. At first the book was complicated with all of the ""ins and outs"", but when I got near the mid point I was hooked.This is a terrific book! I give it two extreamly entusiastic thumbs up!"
5,"Seasons change, but the worthiness of this book never will.","I have been quite a collector of Christopher Pike over the years. This has remained my favorite book, not just by Christopher Pike, but for all time. Mr. Pike's incorporation of drama, fantasy, and horror all combine to make the reader a believer. I still get the chills any time someone mentions the possibility of traveling to Mars during our lifetime. I love the way that Mr. Pike always seems to have two seemingly unrelated tales within his books, but always has them combine in such a way that you can scarcely believe it. It's two incredible stories for the price of one. Read this book. enjoy it, and keep it close to your heart."
3,Falls Short of Pike's Best,"I heart Chris Pike. One of my favorite authors. But...Man, was this book slow. Two hundred pages in and nothing was happening - & the character development not original enough to merit that space. Stephen King can get away with it, usually. But it's a tough sell. Didn't think the separate storylines hung together too gracefully, either.THE SEASON OF PASSAGE should have been 1/2 the length, and more should have been left to the imagination. The vampires aren't scary. The voices in the heads aren't scary - they try way too hard.Pike's strong suit is atmosphere, which the book has in spades, but the effect is dulled by the tedious length, and there are other books where he plays the atmosphere up much better. His YA thriller MONSTER traversed similar territory to sharper effect."
5,repeating the others,"Having looked at some of the other reviews, I too have must say that this is perhaps one of the most complex and amazing books I have ever read. I always handed out my well worn paperback copy of the book or purchased it for friends who like Vampire stories. And like many of the others, I had to get a second copy, this time on hardcover, to make sure I had a decent one around the house. I only wish Christopher Pike would write more adult novels. I read his YA as a child and loved them. This book shows what extreme talent he has. Read it!"
5,"Impressive coming from Pike, he matured","I read Chrisopher Pike's books years ago, around the ages of seven or eight, and then I kind of grew out of them. Season of Passage was still sitting on my shelf, unread, because I couldn't wade through the plot development at that age. But a few years later I picked it up once again and when I finished it I realized that it'd had a profound effect on me. It was a very powerful story, my favorite that Christopher Pike has ever written. (Although I still really enjoy Remember Me"
1,Awful smell,"I bought 3 of these and when I got them , they all didn't smell like candies cologne.... Waiste of money don't bother buying this item off of here ... Going to try another seller"
3,Basic recipes for a beginner cook,"This cookbook would be a good buy for someone newly cooking for him or her self - a good gift for a college student. It has a range of easy vegetarian dishes, shopping and vegetable prep tips, and recipes scaled to serve one or two people. It's really a book for the neophyte cook, someone looking to save money, make themselves dinner, and not go to extra trouble or expense.More experienced folks looking for innovation will likely find it too basic and repetitive. Someone looking for an encyclopedic vegetarian equivalent to ""The Joy of Cooking"" would do well to seek out Deborah Madison's ""Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone."""
2,Nothing too inventive here - Might be good for beginner,"I purchased this book from ... and then returned it. It wasn't that I felt the recipes were bad, just not imaginative. The author spent many pages on very basic things like things to add to a green salad, but nothing seemed all that diferent or inventive. I was hoping for a few more recipes that showed some unique touches and instead got scaled back basics. In the future I will just make 1/2 of my favorite recipes from other vegetarian cookbooks I own.This book may be good for a new vegetarian or someone trying to become vegetarian since the smaller recipes let you try different things with fewer leftovers (in case you don't like it!), or for someone who entertains and sometimes has a mixture of veg & non-veg guests. It would allow them to make a separate entree for the veg guests."
1,High price for lowest quality,The Vaultz CD storage cabinets have potential for being a great product. It is unfortunate that they are almost non-functional. It took exceptional force to open the drawers. It was then impossible to close them again. The front panel of the drawer is too large to fit in the drawer opening.
4,cd is good.....,"The product is great. However don't waste money on expedited shipping. I waited 2 weeks to get my ""overnight"" package."
4,Something for everyone,"This is a 2-disc effort showcasing two very different sets from DJ Dan. Being a devoted rave music fan, I have to dismiss CD 1 and say its probably a tasty treat for the club kids and those who adore vocals throughout their electronica. Its not for me. Disc 2 is more suited to my taste--it opens with a pop opera, very catchy tune filled with funky vocals, but then takes you on a beautiful journey, building with techno and funky house sounds with some acid lines building the tempo, peaks masterfully and then smooths down into some trancey stuff and lets you off the ride elated with a big grin. DJ Dan remains a master DJ."
4,"Birds, Bees and Babies '94","THE BEST MISTAKE by Nora RobertsZoe Fleming wasn't looking for a lover, or a husband, or a father for her young son. She just wanted a tenant. But when sexy, single J. Cooper McKinnon turned up, Zoe needed to figure out - had one of the biggest, or one of the best mistakes of her life just walked in the door.THE BABY MACHINE by Ann MajorKate Karlington desperately wanted a baby. All her potential daddy candidates, though, were preoccupied with her wealth. Then there was sexy, single dad Jim Keith Jones - who was just plain interested in Kate. He'd be her ""baby machine,"" if Kate agreed to his price...CULLEN'S CHILD by Dallas SchulzeThe last thing live-in lovers Cullen Roberts and Darcy Logan ever dreamed of was that they'd become instant parents. But that was what happened when Cullen gained custody of his young niece. Trouble was, while Cullen adored the child, Darcy hardened her heart. Would Darcy ever admit the secret pain that kept her from loving this little girl?"
1,Not one of the best documentary on this subject,"Apart from revealing the identity of the famous informer of the Washington Post, in the Watergate investigation, this is not a very good documentary. The narrative style is somehow superficial, lacking a real insight in the matter, almost exclusively concentrating on the character of ""deep throat"" as if we were looking at a Hollywood star biography, rather than a simple piece of a more complicated and important plot. In the end the documentary focuses on an important yet secondary character of the story. Putting ""deep throat"" in the center of your ""solar system"" instead of President Nixon, alters the whole balance of the narration, loosing the proper perspective and therefore the necessary historical depth, making this account of Watergate a sideshow of a sideshow."
3,A time capsule,Molloy's original Woman's Dress for Success Book is well written and full of information for women entering the work force in the 1970's and early 80's. It shows what the first professional working women had to go thru to establish themselves in a man's world. But not much of the book is relevant to the year 2000. I hope Molloy pulls up a chair to his computer soon and gives us an edition for the new millenium
3,Dressing for Work,Smart womem dress to get better jobs and better pay. Mr. Molloy tells you what to wear and why.
5,Creepshow 2 - Kicks Arse!,"Yesssss, they don't make 'em like this too often. This movie is truly bone-chilling! I love all 3 stories on here, the best one is definitely The Raft, followed by The Hitchhiker, and last but not least The Indian story. Rent this baby, or better let, just buy the freakin' tape, watch it super duper late, and sit back and embrace True horror! This one is alot better than the 1st one. The Raft story alone is worth buying, have the pleasure of viewing this enormous-grotesque looking blue blob that floats in the water, and is in desperate need of some fresh blood! The 4 scared teens have to escape this death trap somehow... Some other movies worth checking out are... Necronomicon:Book of The Dead, Bodybags. Creepshow 2 rules!"
1,"a truely ""creepless"" show","this sequel in name only is the low end of horror anthologys and the bottom of the river as far as scares. all the fun of the first is gone and what we are left with is this at 90mins.,much to long movie that just sits there and goes nowhere. no stars for this junk!!!!!!"
1,CHEAP LOOKING CREEP,"Not once has anyone ever seen such a collection of low-budget wierdness. You can't blame the actors; they are pretty good. Blame the lame storylines, lousy music, and stupid props.Just trust me. Not scary, not thrilling, not worth the time. The only thing great here was the cute topless girl, to be honest."
4,Creepshow 2 stands the test of time,"I love films that consist of a few short stories and Creepshow 2 is one of the best out there. The first time I saw it I was very young a remeber it being so enjoyable being creepy and fun at the same time. I decided to check it out to see if it was still as good, and luckily it was.The film consists of three short stories;""Chief WoodNHead"" A story about a shop owners wooden Indian that comes to life for the evening to exact revenge. (Probably my favorite one)""The Raft"" A story involving some kids who decide to take a swim out to a raft in the middle of the lake only to find a man eating substance stands in their way.""The Hitchhiker"" A story of an unfaithful wife who runs down a hitchhiker and finds that she can't quite get rid of him.I would definately recommend checking out Creepshow 2 if you haven't already. It's really a classic horror flick."
3,unique film,"this movie is pretty good considering its uniqueness. it's diffrent than your regular horror film. it's not scary but the story's are pretty good. there's 3 stories in this dvd and some cool animation. the first story is about a wooden indian who comes to life and gets revenge for his people. theres some funny parts in this story and its not really scary but the thought of the wooden indian coming to life is pretty scary. this story is about a 7 from 1-10 on scariness. and the second story is about a some sort of killer blob that eats people. its about a 7 on 1-10 scariness, its a pretty good story and the third story is about a hitchiker coming back from the dead. this one isnt scary at all, its a little lame but its about a 5 on 1-10 level. overall , its a ok dvd. theres not that many extra's but its a unique film, worth buying."
4,"should be in your collection, if you call yourself an 80's horror movie fan...","Creepshow 2 contains-1.)three cost effective stories, first is mediocre, but the other two are great.2.)an EXCELLENT animated wraparound featuring the creep, a weird kid, and his run-in with some bullies. reminds you of late eighties saturday morning cartoons. my favorite part of the movie.3.)cool/cheesy music.4.) good acting for such a low budget movie.5.) great locations. really convincing.you see a desert town, a mountain lake, and the icy highways of Maine.6.) good monster effects in the raft sequence and a great mutilated corpse in the hitch hiker.They did really well with such a small budget. the oil slick is scary. don't believe what the detractors say.but....1.) this deluxe edition's commentary and bonus documentary are lame. I thought they made this movie look bad but....................Creepshow 2 is a great movie. Recommended."
2,Dissapointment,"This film was a great dissapointment for me, primarily because the first Creepshow was pretty good. None of the 3 stories were very scary and the Hitchhiker was just plain silly. I have to agree ""The Raft"" was the best of the three but stupidity and bad acting kept it kind of lame- especially at the end. I wont ruin it for you, but you'll see what I'm talking about -if you want to waste your time."
1,Not the scariest movie ensemble ever created !,My DVD player does not want to play this to begin with. I've seen it before so buying it was a mistake - truly.
2,Not Great At All,"Creepshow 2 was made on a budget that was less than half of its predecessor's, and it shows. There are only three stories compared to the first film's five. As a result, the pacing is slowed considerably in each tale and you get the sense that the movie is just killing time.The budget shortfalls really show in the film's main antagonists. The original creepshow featured scary Zombies, a human plant, and a ferocious looking ape-like beast who jumps out of a crate and eats people.The best that Creepshow 2 can come up with is a floating tarpaulin in a lake that melts peoples' skin off their bones.The creep is no longer a three-dimensional animatronic creation. He is sometimes a cartoon, and other times he's a guy walking around in a funny looking prosthetic mask."
2,"mediocre, dull, and uninspired","not as good as the first one and pretty forgetable....it has none of the ""living comic book"" charm that I loved in the first one. that and there are only three stories and more animation. only the blob in the water one was worth watching. If you see it, watch for the joint that the blonde guy pulls out of nowhere after swimming to the raft in a speedo! funny. Romero and King seemed to not be as enthused as they were when making the first one.I just didnt like it...skip it and get the first one"
2,lame as hell,"3 short films?!?!? thats it?? i feel severly ripped off even after i picked this up used! it feels like the skits that didnt make creephow 1 were mushed together onto this. chief wooden head isnt scary at all. if you think that is scary, you are easily frightened. the raft is defiantely the best on here by far. that blob thing does creep me out i shall admit. especially the ending to it!! the hitchhiker is so stupid i felt moronic for viewing this. there is nothing scary or funny about a bloody zombie that says ""thanks for the ride lady"" over and over. i just want to know why anchor bay released a stellar edition if this heap of scrap when they could have done creepshow 1 instead. that one is better.two stars for ""the raft""if only they all held up like that story..."
3,A mostly entertaining anthology.,"Three tales of terror abound in this sequel to the popular original anthology. They include a story about a statue coming to life, a group of teens stuck on a raft with something in the water picking them off, and a hitchhiker who just won't stay dead. The first story is completely routine and lacking in any sense of menace or fun, but The Raft is a surprisingly scary segment (And the best of both Creepshows) and The Hitchhiker is pretty suspenseful, too. Kinda cheesy at times, but this is an enjoyable anthology."
4,"Not better than the first,but good","Like most of the reviews I've read on here it seems that the second story ""THE RAFT"" would be the most popular.I agree also.this one can scare the living s==t out of kids who like to swim..(it's also very funny..To me anyway..and that's the point of C1 and C2) The first story is predictable and slow...""We all know what's gonna happen"". The third is a lot better and a hell of a lot funnier... ""I wonder if she would have said """"you're welcome"""" he would have left her alone...lol..Good stuff,worth seeing."
3,Thanks for the Ride Lady!,This Movie Had some very Remeberable parts in it! It's not as good as the first one but it is entertaining. This Video has several different stories in one. There's this one story about a woman who picks up a hitchhiker unwillingly and can't get rid of him. Even after Death! Heh! THANKS FOR THE RIDE LADY! To understand you must SEE! You won't regret this purchase!
3,Not as original as the first but entertaining!!!,"The tag line for the original was THE MOST FUN YOU'LL HAVE BEING SCARED. In this second installment the tagline should have been NOT AS MUCH FUN AND NOT AS SCARY. The Wooden Indian story had me feeling really down, those poor store owners!! But it was fun to see the Wooden Indian come to life and gets some revenge (2 out of 5). The Raft story was spooky. The tar pit was a good idea, I felt they really could have made this one work more (4 out of 5). The ""Potential"" Hitch-hiker story isn't really much of anything. So A woman hits a guy and won't die. Not much thought there (2 out of 4). An average of about 3 but the quality of the DVD will make me want to buy it. Doesn't look like there will be a lot of extras though."
3,Amusing,"I have two main complaints with this movie. The first is the length. It's simply too short. The three stories could have been more elaborate, or they could have added one or two additional stories. The second complaint is about the third story. I'm glad the Hitchiker was short, it was a sad attempt at comedy or just deserts for an adulterer. Old Chief Wooden Head and the Raft were entertaining. The Raft was pretty scary, it shows the damage a slick can do. Like what an oil slick does to wildlife, but worse."
4,Hello Boils and Ghouls!,This is a great collection of short stories. Chief wooden head being my favourite! It is definately worth buying.
4,Good follow up but not as good as the 1st!,"Let me start off by saying that I loved creepshow, I was somewhat dissapointed with this one. I bought a box set called 3 from the mind of Stephen King, just for this one. But I figured out that the other two (children of the corn and maximum overdrive) where alot better! anyways, the first story starts of with a wooden indian coming to life and seeking revenge. this story is called Ol' chief woodenhead. then next story is ""the raft"" this one is probably my favorite one of them all. its about four friends whose vacation to a lake turns into a nightmare! and the last story is about a lady who runs over a hitchiker and he comes back to life and haunts her. and by the way the creep looks nothing like he did in the first! Rated R for horror violence, language, and some nudity."
2,"Allright, but not as good as the first.","This is far from Romero's best. The predictable stories include a wooden indian coming to life, a hitchhiker who dies and torments a driver, etc. The nudity in this film is pointless and unneeded. see it for ""the raft"" which is the only decent story."
2,The Raft was the Only Thing Worth Watching in This Pile of Crap.,"Viewed: 11/03, 10/04, 3/06Rate: 43/06: Two stories of Creepshow 2, Ol' Chief Wooden Head and The Hitchhiker, were crap, so forget them. The middle story is The Raft, which deserves a credit as a great horror story. The set up, the atmosphere, the story, the idea of it, and the direction of it were just right. It meets all the criteria of a real horror short story. I loved the ending, just brilliant. Moreover, the cartoon supplied as an extra, the same idea as Tales From the Crypt would do to open and close the show, is great as well, and I enjoyed that one. Sadly, the rest wasn't up to the same because of the extremely, I mean extremely, boring stories and poorly directed. Nice to see the aged Dorothy Lamour, famed for teaming up with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in the Road to... series."
2,Not close to the first,"While it has its moments, this sequal doesn't even compare to the first one. The cartoons between the stories are embarrassingly lame, and the Indian story is awful. The Raft is pretty creepy, and I think the hitchhiker story is the only one that comes close to anything from the original."
3,Letters To The President,"A good Chistian pop-punk band off the much underrated Tooth & Nail label. There's nothing really sparkling about this album. Anything but mature, but for its genre, this is actually a pretty good album for younger ears just getting into ""rock"" music. Decent melodies, lyrics do have present a message, and hey they're young so there's a lot of room for improvement.Standout tracks are ""Things We Go Through"", ""From Underneath"", and the introspective piano ballad about the drama that goes with touring ""36 Days"".For fans of Simple Plan, Relient K's old stuff, and Sanctus Real"
4,Very Good Debut-A Little Shallow on the Lyrics Side of Things,"Well, as Hawk Nelson's first album, I'd have to say it's VERY good. The songs are catchy, fast, and for the most part a good comfortable rock sound that most people should enjoy almost upon putting it in.The only complaint I have about this CD is the lyrics. While they are fun, and sometimes deeply meaningful, I'm still dissapointed with the lack of God's name in lots of these songs. I would say, (lyric wise) your best bet in Christian ""punk"" is Stellar Kart, but these lyrics are definately deeper than just about any of Reliant K's ""another Christian ""punk"" band"" albums, and for that reason, I think you could do MUCH worse than picking up Letters to the President, as it is a lot of fun."
4,Redundance,I like the characters in Debbie's books but she is redundant in her descriptions of the characters very chapter or two.
4,Welcome back...,"Cedar Cove is the the fictional town that Debbie Macomber has created for this series and 44 Cranberry Point centers around the mystery of the death that occurred one rainy night at the Thyme and Tide Bed and Breakfast that is owned by town residents Bob and Peggy.As in the previous books in this series, you will also get the chance to meet up with all the past towns people that have been highlighted. Just to name a few you have....Ian and Cecilia from 16 Lighthouse RoadGrace Sherman from 204 Rosewood LaneandRosie and Zach Cox from 311 Pelican CourtI would never say that this series should be considered literary classics, but they are an enjoyment to read and I am looking forward to 50 Harbor Street that comes out in September 2005."
2,Good...until the end!,"I know that a lot of books will have a next installment in the series, but at least they will usually try to tie up loose ends in some sort of fashion. This book just left you hanging. I thought, ""Is that really the end?!?"" I liked it otherwise."
5,Clever Mystery,Currently reading and am very happy with the book. It was delivered in a timely manner and in excellent condition. I have enjoyed all of Debbie Macomber books that I ordered and plan on ordering more in the future.
4,Macomber fan,"I've really enjoyed this whole series, It's light reading and i really enjoy the characters and the small town of Cedar Cove,"
3,44 Cranberry Point,"I really didn't like the ending. There were too many lose ends. I know many of her books are really published in a series, but..I will try another title."
3,A fast simply we read,The story line is an old time soap opera. Multiple story lines keeps things interesting...left with cliff hangers to encourage the next instalment.
3,Not what I expected,"It was a little hard getting into this book, but once I did it was good. The most confusing part was keeping track of the three or more couples/subplots. It's like the book includes several books overlapping."
3,44 Cranberry Point,"I purchased all six in this series. I read all six and a 7th one comes out the fall of 2007. I enjoyed the pleasant story of a small town but after six books I felt the pattern of the writing got very repetative. Most of the following books spent time filling you in on the events that took place earlier and repeated who was related to who. After awhile, this detracted from the light plot to the point of becoming annoying. If you want a fast, lazy summer read at least the first three books are good just for fun."
2,SO SO,"This book overly repeats and gives indepth explanations for things that are self exclamatory...In my opinion it's not a good book, it's just ok.I get very annoyed with the reader and a lot of the story line(which is very slow and boring). I am really just passing the time with this book. I have skipped parts without really missing anything so I wouldn't recommend this as a good read, this book is just so so."
3,Never A Dull Moment in Cedar Cove,"This is the fourth installment of the Cedar Cove series. It is like visiting a favorite vacation spot and catching up with friends you've been missing and wanting to get together with.I gave it three stars because it seems to be a bit lacking in zippy dialogue and personality....However,it is a warm family atmosphere Ms. Macomber always offers up and I so appreciate her wholesomeness and values that come through in her stories.I will wait to read the next installment and know the residents of Cedar Cove will love and support each other in very interesting ways~!"
5,Love this little town,"I was so excited to get the book from the library. I sat down in one seating and read it. I want to move to Cedar Grove, Washington. But I love the stories about the small town. I would highly recommend it especially if you have liked the other books in the series."
5,Great Series!!,This is a wonderful series by Debbie. It's hard waiting for the next one to come out. This series is a great escape while reading it.
3,Just OK,This is not one of Macombers best but the story line does carry you through. I was not really thrilled with it and don't know if I will continue to follow this series.
5,A great product as advertised.,Much of the content of the picture frames I photograph is encased in reflective glass. This filter does a great job of removing a lot of the interfering reflections.
3,"Great filter, but know what you're buying!","If you read the description of this item, you may believe that you are buying the S-HMC (Super Hoya Multi-Coated)filter, but, in fact, you are only getting the HMC one.As far as filters go, I have been very impressed with how nice and thin it is, and it does a wonderful job reducing the reflections off of water! Overall, I'd say that this is a great product, and the only reason I'm not rating it higher is because of the misleading description. As a product I do understand that this is not necessarily fair, but if the description and main picture of this were to change, I would be more than happy to update the rating higher!"
2,Misleading item title.,"The title of this item when I purchased it lead me to believe this was the more expensive digital multicoated Hoya filter. I think this was probably done intentionally since the vendor on this item seems to change names often.However, it did arrive in good condition and in good time and I still like the filter. While I saved a few bucks, it just wasn't the great deal that it appeared to be."
4,good for a child with sensitive gums,Bought this for my daughter (9 years old) who has very sensitive gums and she can use it. It doesn't have floride in it (please double check that) and it doesn't make her gums red like regular toothpaste does. She likes the flavor too. Only complaint I have is it is awfully sweet and sticky but hey its toothpaste!
4,Lutheranism by Gritsch and Jenson,"This was used as a textbook for a diakonia class. It helped explain and put into context the various documents in the Book of Concord. I like how it noted which sections of which documents were covered by each chapter; however, the referenced titles of the sections/articles for these documents did not always match what was used in my edition of the Book of Concord."
5,wonderful product,"The hat is more than I had hoped for. It is very well made, fits great, looks great, and is comfortable. It arrived in two days with regular shipping. It is well worth the price."
4,The temporary death of Vegeta.,"This is a great DVD and you'd be missing out on some huge storyline if you didn't see this. Goku is rejuvinated and Frieza kills Vegeta. First it starts off with Vegeta trying to blast Frieza but Frieza is way too fast for Vegeta and Vegeta realizes he can't do anything to Frieza and stops fighting. Frieza then beats Vegeta up almost to death. Goku comes into the scene, but Frieza fires a finishing blast through Vegeta. This part is very exciting. Goku then begins to fight Frieza and that got a little boring. This is definitely worth getting."
5,How sad.,"I don't usually cry but this made me tear up a little. Waa how sad. Vegeta is the best character and really cool. He shouldn't die. Freeza should die. Oh wait, he does. Oh yeah..."
3,Death Of A Prince,"Well, I got this dvd in the mail today. Aside from Funimation's hilarious attempt to put a good quality dvd with their ""extras"" which aren't even extras and their below average quality dub, the dvd was good, no eyecatchers or intro/endings for each episode yet, but the original version makes up for that, and they do translate perfectly nowadays. The only other thing that would be nice, besides what I've mentioned, would be more episodes per disc."
5,Farewell sweet prince,"When I first found out that Vegeta was going to die,I knew Ihad to see this movie.Vegeta is one of my favorite characters.It was one of the sadest deaths on the series.When Vegeta started to tell Goku his story of abuse and humiliation,especially when Vegeta began to cry,I cried.This was one of the best DBZ movies that I have ever seen.If you are a true DBZ fan,then you don't want to miss out on this one!THE BEST!"
5,Great Video,"This is a great video. I felt bad for Vegeta. One thing though, is that you really don't need to buy it, because these episodes were just shown on Cartoon Network in English. But this one is a must have for all DBZ fans."
1,DBZ is awful,"DBZ, GAG! don't waste your money on anything with the title Dragon Ball Z. Go spend your money on a decent series like Trigun or Cowboy Bebop. I only gave it one star because it didn't have a zero stars option."
2,trap,this is a trap! It shows sinitta's first album cover and it's the second album you listen! Very poor recording quality! buy the english one instead!
2,"great price, but does not connect to shop vacuum",This sander is easy to use. It does not connect to a shop vac. The saw dust collector has a small rectangular outlet.
1,Piece of Crap,"I wouldn't wish this belt sander on my worst enemy. I bought one and the dust collector plugged up in a couple of hours. Shortly after that the thing stopped working entirely. I brought it back to the store and they let me exchange it for a new one, which plugged up even faster. I can't figure out how to unjam the dust collector without taking the whole thing apart. While it was working, it was nearly impossible to keep the belt straight, it wanders in and out like crazy."
3,It's Ok. Should've spent the extra money though...,...because I can tell that I will just end up going back and getting a better brand and higher end model in the next year or two. This one does an OK job for must of the around the house / weekend warrior stuff. The ergonomics of the moveable handle as well as the fwd piece that moves up to allow tight spot sanding are very nice options. And I would have to say that for under $100 you would be hard pressed to find a better sander. But this sander will not stand up to a Porter Cable or DeWalt model that runs roughly $150. You would be better off shelling out the money... cause you always get what you pay for when talking about these companies.
2,Black& Decker model DS321 Sander,"I purchased this sander because I liked the features of the product. The sander has a very low profile that allows the user to get close the edge of a floor or another area where there is a right angle. However, during my first use I was disapointed to find that the lever that compresses the tension spring for the belt failed. I had to return the sander to a service center for repair the first day it was in use. It seems to me that the lever is made of poor quality material. Hopefully, the replacement will be made better. I think the design is great for a homeowner's basic needs."
3,Black & Decker dragster belt sander,"A pure consumer product that falls short of producing professional results. Important to experiment matching the sandpaper grit to the work. Hint: fine doesn't produce the result one expects from a belt sander. Relatively light, easy to use, but left me wishing I had paid more to get a stronger machine."
2,The little sander that couldn't,"I needed a sander for a single project (an oak table), so I didn't want to commit to a more expensive tool that would never be used again. This little thing is weak to the point that after 2-3 hours of sanding at 60 grit I still wasn't finished. The belt will always veer to one side and it makes a terrible high-pitched noise. I'm selling it for anything I can get and waiting for something more powerful on craigslist."
1,No good... Now I have to get a real one,"Looks good and feels good, but the belt walks so much you end up with more shavings from the belt than the wood. No matter what you do, you can't keep the belt from traveling off track. Not worth it, even for the occasional user such as me. Spend a little more the first time, that's what I'm going to have to do now."
4,real good little sander,"i have owned this for about 2 yrs now and i have put it through a darn good workout and it has performed very much better than expected. i am a tool freak and own a roofing and remodeling business. we are hard on tools and trucks. this sander is a great performer, especially for the money. have not had the least troube from it. actually performed better than an industrial sander that i used before. easy to control, tracks real good, i was amazed at how good it has performed. others complained about certain things but i guess they just got a lemon. i have been really impressed by this sander, especially when considering the price.we have even used it for a lot of things that it was not designed for and were pleasantly surprised at the performance and quality and quantity of work it has produced. would give a five except that i won't even give snap-on or proto, craftsman that high rating."
2,Poorly Conceived or Executed Design,"I purchased the sander to sand an oak table and gouged it up. I returned it.1) One of the roller bearings howls loudly.2) The sander left gouges in the wood I was sanding with 150 G belt.Given my experience along with these reviews, Black and Decker should take this sander off the market."
5,Upside Down,"They don't really tell you but unlike high-end sanders, you can stick two finishing nails in the bench top and put it over them upside down. Now its a bench sander, and you can grind huge, complex shapes in metal, wood or plastic. Freehand, it makes surfboards or hardwood floors.Be sure to wear a dustmask and face shield, and ear protectors. This is a really cool tool."
2,Great concept. Poor execution.,"I bought one of these at Home Depot two days ago and spent a good chunk of yesterday sanding studs with it to remove mold. Up until the last belt change I was in love. It was cheap, lightweight, it worked, and the cutesy front wheel really does provide great access into tight spaces. Then for some reason the belt tensioner stopped working. After less than one day's use it was broken. Needless to say it went back to Home Depot and today I'm shopping Amazon for something a little sturdier."
3,Good for small projects,"Never owned and belt sander before, so I just picked the one that looked the coolest... Good for simple projects around the house, I can't imagine it would be of any real use to a serious wood worker. Haven't had the squeak that other reviews mention, but have only put about 2 hours on it so far. A few non-performance related gripes... because of it's odd shape, a case would have been nice, so it can be stored with my other tools. Other gripe is the dust bag. Would have been great if you could attach a shop vac, but you can't. I scoured B&D's website, hoping there was some sort of attachment, but no dice. All in all... nice, easy to use sander for small DIY'er type projects, but probably not a good idea for bigger projects."
4,Not a bad tool for DIY,"I'm constantly getting myself into DIY projects, and I picked up this sander to help in stripping my front door. I've used more traditional belt sanders in the past, and if needed a quality belt sander for daily use, this would not be the tool I'd select. However, I expect to ues the tool a few times a year, and the unique belt path on this model is really nice for use in tight spaces. So for me, given my light usage, the ability to get into tighter spaces, and the low price point, this was a good buy."
2,A cheap disposable sander,Bought this sander after I had burned through a $160 DeWalt sander. Needed something quick to get a job done and purchased this sander. I really like the design of this sander it is pretty versatile. At a fraction of the weight of my last DeWalt it was easier to maneuver and sits upside down nicely. I don't use belt sanders frequently and this sander did the job when I needed it. It lasted 15 or so hours and went through 10 high quality belts before biting the dust. My last two belt sanders were DeWalt sanders and only lasted a bit longer than this much cheaper Black & Decker sander. After the failure of the second DeWalt I picked up one of these cheap Black & Decker sanders because it used the same belts. With the limitations of the DeWalt and their short lifetimes I can easily buy 3 of these sanders and not feel too bad about tossing these after a few hours of use. A cheap disposable sander I'll buy it again.
4,Great product,"There are numerous reviews that are negative on this product. If you use the sander according to the directions. The sander is lightweight, easy to handle, and makes quick work of any sanding project. I am usually sanding down scrap lumber I get from construction sites and the sander is far superior than the heavier pricy models. Yes you do adjust the tracking whenever you put a new sanding belt on, and when pushing down to hard and going side to side with the sander...which is not the way to use this sander. For the price this product is great and I just bought a replacement because of user error...the power cord became stuck in the sander and fried the motor before I could turn it off...see all my fault."
4,Pretty good,I have the 7 amp version of this sander and I really like it. The tracking was sketchy at first but it finally settled down. Now I really only have to fiddle with it about 1 time per every hour of sanding.Really nice little unit. Craftsman does offer the same sander w/different colors but you would be better off finding a Black and Decker outlet and picking up a reconditioned unit for around $40.
1,Worthless,Power is very poor. Belt nearly stops with even moderate pressure. Evenness of sanding is horrible. I can't recall having been so disappointed in a product.
1,Don't be fooled by the sexy design,Never have I had a tool go south so fast. Belt tracking is a joke. good luck getting it to track straight after you start sanding. It runs extremely hot after only a few minutes and then the rear roller comes off! I spent a couple hours with my brand new sander sanding a table top and the sander was ready for the trash bin. I am steaming and this is the last Black and Decker product I will ever purchase. Spend the money on something else!
3,Noisy,This sander does a good job of removing stock rapidly but it tends to leave deep grooves if you stop the travel anywhere on the board itself and don't complete the stroke off the end of the board. It is also quite loud and could benefit from a variable speed control.
4,Suncatcher,I got this as a gift and I have it hanging up in my classroom on the wall so I am not clear how well it looks on the window pane however I like the colors and craftmanship.
2,a little too much explanation,"Kyle works hard at making dancing as simple as possible, but I found the pace much too slow. You shouldn't have time to explain things between steps 1 and 2. Despite the ultra-slow breakdown, I didn't get a good feel for any steps before he moved on."
2,"Invitation to Dance - Ballroom Walts, Rumba, Cha Cha","The dance is casual and informal. It doesn't show much stylistic difference between Rumba and Cha Cha that the international style stresses. A more informative Editorial Review on the back cover should have mentioned this.Less oral explanation and more demonstration would make the two tapes more appealing.If you like the casual style, the package worths the price."
4,"Good, swinging, clean fun","This CD gives me yet another reason to wonder why Robbie Williams has never made it in the US the way he has elsewhere. While this is without a doubt very different from his other CDs, it's also an undoubted success. The duets with Nicole Kidman, Jon Lovitz and Rupert Everett are reason enough to buy it (who knew Jon Lovitz had such a smooth, sweet voice?), and the songs he does on his own are quite charming. As with all of Robbie's albums, there is a hidden track at the end, this one featuring outtakes from the recording sessions. On this CD, Robbie proves (as if we had a doubt) that he really can sing, and his phrasing on some of the songs is just lovely."
5,What a great find,"I heard ""Beyond The Sea"" on the ""Finding Nemo"" DVD. I thought it was fantastic; at first I thought it might've been Harry Connick Jr., but when I saw it was someone named Robbie Williams, whom I never had heard of, I went to the internet to do some research. Found out that he was in a UK boy band and was a little wary, but I bought the CD (Import) and was blown away. Hope he does more of this type of music."
5,One of the biggest Robbie Williams Fan,Robbie Williams is a great singer. I love how he takes his music and adds humor. This cd is a great cd. I have all of his cd's and I would say this is one of the best one.
5,The Greatest European Entertainer !,"Mister Robbie Williams dares singing American standards.Well, he does it his way and it is just perfect. The DVD of his show at the Albert Hall is also great : Robbie is a true entertainer and Americans just love that. He knows how to talk to the audience, to play along with them, to invote co-stars on stage .."
1,Just another Over Confidence guy want to sing Sinatra,"Tell Robby,, dont be overconfidence, Everybody can do that stuff..even this should not worth any star"
1,zero talent - we are in a new age,"I don't know why people cannot see through this guy with his weak, reedy, nasal, karaoke voice making massacre of swing tunes.This guy is possessed of lesser talent than Liam Gallagher (and that IS saying something).Anyone who know's the kid's tale - 'Emperor's New Clothes' - see the similarity - that is mr. williams- shame that I canot give this -5000"
5,the best 2001 year swing disc,"This disc is a rare case of good taste, better swings standards and a unique oportunity for enjoy with the the work of a mature artist. A tribute for 50's crooners MUCH better professionals than a plenty of todays artists.A gem.Please listen Ain't that a kick in the head, Mr. Bojangles or me and my shadow and yo will anderstand."
2,Why buy it?,"Robbie didn't do a bad job. The vocals aren't bad. But why buy this CD when you can buy the originals. The originals are much better. Robbie Williams isn't a bad singer but he isn't a Frank Sinatra. Don't buy it, buy Frank's album instead as there is no comparison."
2,oh robbie,"robbie williams is a fantastic singer and has a great future ahead of him but this album to me was a real set back for him. he took on the roll of a jazzy pop singer and it unfortunatly was not, in my eyes, a good look for the robster. a good album but for robbie's voice it was not the best look for this man. sorry."
4,Robbie takes a risk and wins,"After ""Sing when you're winning"" (something of a breakthrough album for him), Robbie decided to take on his riskiest project: a cover of standards from the 40s, 50s and 60s. To everyone surprise, he succeeded. The album is wonderful to listen. The hit single of the album was Somethin' Stupid (a cover of Frank and Nancy Sinatra's hit by Robbie and Nicole Kidman - yes, she can sing), but the album has a lot of other great songs - Mack the Knife, Well did you Evah (a duet with Jon Lovitz!), Mr. Bojangles, the wonderful Things (a duet with Jane Horrocks), Ain't that a Kick in the Head, They can't Take that Away from Me (a duet with Rupert Everett!), and finally, to me the best song in the album, Beyond the Sea (originally a french song, but made famous by Bobby Darin in the 1960s)."
5,A classy Album by a raunchy Brit,"A good jazzy, swinging album ala Michael Buble. If you liked Buble's Cd along with Josh Groban, You'll like what Robbie Williams does here. Great with a bunch of duets with Nicole Kidman, Rupert Evrett and others."
5,Excellent,Robbie shows here that he can master whatever he wants to sing. I just loved the way he signs these songs.
3,"A Lovely, Lovely Book","Arbor is a Frenchman now living in America who owns a restaurant. One of the pleasures of this book is that it contains many, many recipes. But that is certainly not the only pleasure.And that's what this book is all about: Pleasures. Simple pleasures. The pleasures that French people find in their every day lives. Preparing food. Eating. Spending time with their families. Spending time with their friends.A lovely, lovely book. I want to see this way of life at work (and, hopefully, I will...in two weeks!) and I want to bring it back home with me to my town."
4,Deliciously inspiring,"For something quick to read and to be inspired and swept away at the same time, I recommend Joie de Vivre. Robert Arbor is a restaurateur who knows his stuff when it comes to what constitutes an enjoyable meal and good times spent with family and friends. There are no frills or expensive equipment used here; he shows you his own kitchen with it's low tech range and rustic charm. His recipes for good, wholesome and satisfying meals are simple for just about anyone to make and add to their own repertoire. Roast chicken, croque monsieur, perfect hot chocolate and good coffee. Make them, savor them and be transported to a little French village somewhere warm and fragrant with lavender."
3,French Kitchen Tips,"Nice, but focused on a few perfect recipes, and the ""French Life"" as seen from the kitchen. If you are a fan of ""Encore Provence"" but found it over-the-top, this is for you. More homey and real life."
3,Interesting in a Subtle Way,Author's reflections on ways that Americans could enrich their lives by appreciating and cultivating domestic delights. Lots of recipes initially led me to believe that the book was mostly fluff; my husband had the same reaction. I did read the whole book and found it to be sweet and gently inspiring.
5,Terrific book on how to enjoy life to the fullest.,This book is full of ideas on how to enjoy life. The pop-corn pan is the best idea ever. Somethings in life should be easy. Put your effort into enjoying your family & friends. He has many great ideas and suggestions on how to do spend your time wisely. One of the many books that has subtly changed my life.
2,Lacking,"I was a little surprised that being this was a hardcover that more of a budget wasn't put into this book for simple things. A copy editor, and a real photographer would have been nice. Espresso is referred to as ""expresso"" throughout the book save for once, and it takes him 2 pages to say what could be conveyed in a paragraph. The photos are horrible; these are all snapshots, where nothing is lit properly, and I would have thought a book like this would have some gorgeous photography. The recipes are all fine and dandy, and the author does the usual pontification about Americans needing to slow down and have a nice coffee. It's escapist, but being that's the nature of the book itself, I wish the publisher could have tried harder. The book ""Stealing Magnolias"", which is about New Orleans, does a much better job with better images, writing, and is more succinct. I assumed this book would be similar. Oh well."
2,IT'S A FANTASY!,"A pleasant read, but not hardly the French way of life.The urban French have no more time to linger over morning coffee, take daily shopping strolls, dally in their gardens, than we here do."
1,Total waste of time,"I can't believe only one other person gave this a poor rating. Maybe the others didn't even bother. I picked up this book at the library, thankfully, so I can return it.This book provides nothing more than a look at the insipid life of a man with a hyphenated identity, but claims to be only French. Most of the images in this book are of his home, friends and kids. It's like a family newsletter made thick and glossy. I honestly don't care to know so much about him.Sure, it's charming to have a home in the French countryside. If you want to read some escapist travelogue, which can be fun, there are lots of those around. If you're looking for a cookbook, find one of those. And if you're looking to improve your life, then head to self-help. This book is none of these. It's just plain dumb."
5,My birthday present to myself,"I don't know whether everything in this book is true. I've never been to France. However, I know that I want it to be true, because what Mr. Arbor has written is so incredibly beautiful and inviting. When he describes how the French approach life with more deliberation and less haste, I sighed. I want that for myself. I want intimate dinners of well cooked food with well chosen friends. I want to cook a few things well, and be able to linger at the table, comfortable in the knowledge that, though the fare may be simple, it is pleasurable. Life in our country can be incredibly stressful. Borrowing a few pages from Joie de Vivre can only enhance my life, and it really is a lovely read. Sigh, I love beautiful books."
4,Lovely to read although idealized,"As long as you accept this as a coffee-table book, it's very nice and relaxing to read. Mr. Arbor's writing style is enchanting and his love of food and (the typically French) enjoyment of small everyday things takes you to another world...away from the stress and blandness.It is quite a bit idealized, however - as one reviewer mentioned, Mr. Arbor's living style (restaurant owner, lives in France and in the US) is probably not typical. Some of the generalizations are rather endearing: ""I've never met anyone who doesn't like roast chicken."" Cooking seems to take a solid 3-4 hours every day in the French people's lives...sometimes you wonder - when do these people actually work? But then you begin to enjoy this book for what it is. The recipes are lovely and not too complicated - they add a way for the reader to actually participate in Mr. Arbor's presentation of French life."
2,Great Toy,"We ordered two of these sets for our little great grand daughter to use in her doll house. They arrived quickly and in good order. A small amount of assembly was required, but it was done easily and quickly. She loves the people--especially the dog and the stroller.Well worth the price."
4,Nikkor Lense Protector,"This was the first Nikkor filter i have purchased to give added lense protection. I was a little surprised in that it easily got cross threaded when it was place on the lense, compared to other non Nikkor filters I have used in the past. Aside from that it works great, and has been easy to clean."
5,Works well,Optically clear and low profile for use with wide lenses. I'm very happy with it. I don't have much more to say.
3,Slight discloration,"The first thing I did once I received this was to place it against a white background and check for discoloration. To my surprise, I found that it DOES introduce a (very) light brownish shade. It is a very light shade, but noticable to the naked eye.I have used the Nikon NC filter from a friend and it does not introduce ANY discoloration - that leads me to believe that I probably got a bad piece - or that the quality has dropped (I assume that Adorama doesn't sell fake Nikon filters)Anyway, other than this slight discoloration, there is no visible distortion introduced by this filter. If you purchase this, do test it against a white background to make sure that you got a good one."
3,The Filter is fine but...,"I usually buy all my photo stuff from BH as when they list it as new it is ALWAYS new and not reboxed. I have bought a lot of Nikon Filters and the first thing I do is check for cleanliness, every one of them has been so perfectly clean out of the box you could not tell there was any glass there at all. Except this one. It had lots of dust and other larger particles all over the glass. Problem with Amazon (sometimes) is you don't always know where the stuff is coming from. In this case it came from Focus Camera and I feel it was returned and sold as new. So the filter itself is great but I had to clean off all the crud that somehow got on there before I could use it."
4,ervin on blue note,"the sound and playng style of booker ervin seems different to me on this recording compared to the 'book' releases on prestige. less aggressive sound or less bending of notes. maybe it's the difference in sound studios, this being a blue note session. sure is great to hear him with the one and only woody shaw. shaw so smooth and selective, along with ervin's confident, urgent style compliment each other well. they sound great together when playing in unison. there is nothing more beautiful than trumpet and tenor played in unison, by two masters of their instruments. very nice solos throughout including kenny barron's solo piano on track four. just focusing on billy higgins drums is rewarding in itself. this is definitely a blue note recording and a good one at that. mz"
4,Great intro to law text,"As an MBA student, this text was a great introduction to business law. The actual cases proved to be quite interesting and illustrative of the topics discussed throughout the text. You must go through the text before reading the cases or you may be confused, but the terms are so well laid out that once familiar with them, the cases are quite easy to understand and you are able to brief them yourself! Will serve as an excellent reference and I have decided to keep it in my library."
1,"Unresponsive, and Uncooperative","I am completely dissatisfied. I ordered the book, which was advertised to be the 13th edition I needed for the course I am taking. However, when I received the book it was the 12th edition and I am unable to use it for my class. When I made a request for a return, the seller said ""I'm stumped...maybe you should try to resell it online."" He made no attempt to figure how to do a return, since that was his reason for not returning the book-HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW!! I made a suggestion to him to send me a check and he refused to return my email. I have not heard from him since and I am now stuck with a book I do not need and cannot use, and must purchase another book for my class."
1,Never received the book,"It has been way passed the delivery window and I haven't received the book, which is sort of a problem because I need the book for a class that I started several weeks ago."
2,wrong one,"book arrived timely fashion but was wrong book. Could not tell from description that this was a study guide and I needed ""real"" book!"
1,poorly implemented,"Plastic refracts the light over the screen to make it hard to read when going out doors, or glancing down at it in my car.Very easy to scratch your ipod since it's a slide in case.At least for me, the bottom cap that is supposed to secure the ipod in place never really fit right when the ipod was in, only when I took the ipod out did it fit correctly.It traps dust underneath the case, especially surrounding the scroll wheel, which requires consistent cleaning.Area around the top also allowed dust into the case, especially the back, which contributed to the scratching on my ipod.Their plastic sheath they provide does not do an effective job of protecting the ipod from scratching, especially since it gets caught on the lip of the case.Decent design, but very poor implentation."
1,Scratches your IPod screen - Beware!!!,"After purchasing the Agent 18 Clickshield case for my new 4G 20g IPod, I needed a case that had a belt clip for when at the gym. After reading most all of the reviews here and on Apple.com, I felt confident that the Contour ISee would work well for me. So I received this case today. I take out the protective shield and after carefully trying to get it on the IPod, it ripped at the seam. I then tried to put the IPod in the case with the plastic shield wrapped around it the best I could. I did not get the IPod in the case as it was too tight and just not the right fit. End result? This little task caused a vertical scratch on my only one week old Ipod screen! My advice? Stay away from this lousy case. If you don't need a belt clip, the Agent 18 ClickShield (which I have) is very nice and clear and stylish. Now I likely will buy some cheesy neoprene case just for the gym use..."
1,Inconvenient to use,I received this product and am planning to return it. It's incredibly cumbersome to use. The side tabs for releasing the bottom from the rest of the case are impossibly difficult to press at the same time. Not at all what I had in mind.
3,Contour Design ISee IPod case,"The case is great to see but the plastic scratched immediately inside my Tune Belt. The protective sleeve provided would take Houdini to get it on but this would not affect the outside scratching problem. On the positive side, access to the dock connector is neat and the top is open allowing access to the headphone jack and lock control. I think it is worth the price."
3,Contraddctions,"How is it possible there are so many different opinions about its fitness? I don't understand. Or it fits properly, or it doesn't at all. I think it is not possible that an iPod fits fine, and someone else's SAME model gets completely different results. So, what's the point? How does it work?"
3,"Ok, I guess","It's not easy to get the ipod with the included sleeve into the iSee case with out making the screen hard to read. The design is a little too tight. otherwise it's a fine product, once you get it together."
1,Don't Buy at any Price,"I read all of the earlier reviews on this iPod case and figured I'd give it a try even though many said it was a poor design - particularily the plastic ""sleeve"".The UPS man brought mine today and it is truly one of the worst designs I have ever seen for something with such a simple purpose (protect the iPod). As others have indicated, the plastic sleeve does not fit the unit (4th Gen 20GB iPOD) and is quite fragile.I ended up using the packing film that covered the screen when the iPod was shipped and scrapping the plastic sleeve (after it ripped).What a piece of junk!!!"
4,Great case,"I like how this case isn't bulky, very secure, and it looks great. The only minor complaint is that the inner protective sleeve bunches up a little when I push the ipod into the plastic case."
1,Cheap case,It Shattered the first time it hit the floor. get one that has some rubber around the edges.
3,Not perfect..,"Well this product doesn't come with a decent manual or guide. Just a couple of flimsy sheets of ""instructions"".It was a pain getting my iPod into the case and all the time I was fretting I would break it. Now that it sits inside the case the plastic casing has been shifted from its ideal position and my iPod is literally STUCK! There is no way I can get it out now... without cracking open the case that is!!Look around for a better case.... although this case is sturdy and will hopefully keep your ipod safe!"
2,half-assed design,What you don't see from the pictures is that you first have to put your ipod in this filmsy cellophane condom wrap before inserting it into the plastic case. It seems like a last minute fix for a major design flaw (without the wrap your ipod will get damaged by dirt and dust).The cellophane condom makes it difficult to get your ipod in the case. The condom doesn't lay totally flat. It gets wrinkles and looks silly inside the case. Go back to the drawing board Contour Designyou have to be able to do better then this.
4,LIVE,"This cd is by a different kind of power trio. They can pull off a blend of trip-hop, house/disco, DnB that is quite remarkable. This is a Live album and should be appreciated as such. This is not pure techno but more like organica. This is what the next age of jam/dance music by live musicians is going to sound like and I can dig it. If Drum and Bass is more your Flava and you aren't disgusted by living breathing musicians I'd also recomend Lake Trout's ALONE AT LAST ....with DJ WHO. Keep it movin'"
2,Millionare Secrets,Nothing Secret about it. Get if you just want to re-educate yourself on industry facts.
5,A jewel of a book.,"I would hastily like to correct a wrong impression given by a reviewer from China. My understanding is that Don Miguel is very pleased with the book and well he should be! This is a very lovely and inspiring work which can be appreciated by readers of the Four Agreements as well as by readers coming to Don Miguel's work for the first time. I have given many as gifts and some have preferred it even to the Four Agreements, probably because of the beautiful presentation given it by Council Oaks Books. I would urge readers to buy them both! This is authentic and visionary Ruiz, based on material in an earlier book but not, as the other reviewer suggested, Being in Vibration which is by Joseph Rael. Definitely a 21st century visionary classic."
5,Must read!,"This is the book I've been looking for; I've read many, and this has the answers. It's an easy read and so insightful. For those who've been searching, search no more...read this book! Read all of his books"
4,Insightful,This book is simple in verbage and yet the ideas expressed are complex in the way that they are as deep as your own personal perception.Definately recommend this book to those who have read reread and truly comprehend the message of Don Miguels other literature. Otherwise some of the subtleties may seem nonsensical.
1,"Oh, the disappointment!","If you are looking for an audio work in the same caliber as the BBC's Lord of the Rings DO NOT BUY THIS!! The audio quality is poor (obviously not remastered for the CD version), the characterization weak, and the first person recounting terrible. I have listened to the BBC's LOTR several times going to and from work and had eagerly anticipated listening to the BBC's Hobbit, but could only stand a minute or two once I actually got it!"
3,Not a reading of the text,"This is a dramatization, like listening to a movie but not seeing the pictures. It is not a word for word reading of the book text. The dramatization might be hard to follow if you haven't read the book. If you know the story well, the dramatization is entertaining."
1,BBC Hobbit tough to listen to,"We were looking forward to a long Christmas drive with our new recording of The Hobbit. Unfortunately, this BBC recording is very difficult to listen to for two reasons. First, the actors talk very quickly in their British accents. Secondly, the range of volumes is quite broad, making it almost inaudible at times. We listened eagerly for about 10 minutes and then gave up."
1,Totally makes fun of Tolkien,I got this out hoping it would be like The Lord of the Rings dramas by BBC. Boy was I wrong! The music was horrendous. Gandalf didn't sound old or wise like he should. He sounds like most of the dwarves!! (and they don't husky voice like they should.) Some of the names weren't pronounce right. Thorin was Toreen and Gollum was Golloom. BBC where did you go wrong!! And LOTR was the earlier one. Stick to that and listen to the Rob Inglis reading of this book!
1,Not the best Audio CD of Tolkien's Hobbit,"First of all, there are two other Audio books I've listened to. The first is the unabridged reading by one speaker and the other is the abridged production by 5 or 6 UK voice actors, which is the best of all 3. Second, the style of this production (being reviewed) can be annoying. It's almost like the Audio CD of a play instead of a book -- not many Audio Plays on the market, are there? Third, the voice casting doesn't at all match what we've come to expect. After more than 50 years, we have movies, cartoons, video games, and other sources that have shaped our constructs and expectations for these classics to such an extent that we need confirmation of what we already know. Even so, I wouldn't recommend this audio book to anyone, not a new Hobbit reader, and not even to someone lacking all the previously formed expectations. It's just not one of the better Audio Books you might find on the Hobbit."
2,BBC Radio Presents The Hobbit,"This is a disappointing offering from the usually stellar BBC Radio Presents series. The sound effects are so overbearing that they interfere with the dialogue. There is not enough distinction among the voices of the characters - thereby making the story tough to follow. Our family (ages 40 + and 6 and 9 ) were displeased by this present from ""Santa."" NOTE: This is a review of the BBC audio version only and not the always-wonderful classic story."
2,Hard to follow...,"This telling of the classic story seems to have had good intentions, however the attempt to bring the action to life through the use of actors portraying elves, dwarfs etc. leaves the listener confused as to who is saying what and exactly what is going on in the story. Having not read to book I found myself having to listen and re-listen to certain portions to prevent losing the plot in all the ruckus and jabbering voices. Additionally, many of the main charactor voices sounded so similar that it was hard to know who was speaking. For fans already familiar with the story or children who may enjoy the sound effects this could be a good option, but for those wanting to hear the plot unfold unencumbered the classic reading would definitely be a better choice."
2,An audio blunder,"If you are a fan of ""The lord of the rings"" audio version by the BBC, BE ADVISED THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THAT! This version of The Hobbit sounds like a group of elementarry children put it together.I realize that the hobbits are little,but the way their voices are on this version is similar to the lollipop guild from the wizard of oz. Very irritating. This is truly a version for children."
3,It was somewhat helpful,Very difficult book to read however it was helpful as an adoptive parent to understand the point of view of the adopted child
1,Nothing more than a Journal,"This book was a horrible waste of time. It is nothing more than a journal for the author in his quest for a PPL - and a poorly written one to boot. It is full of typos and editorial glitches and the style is horribly tedious. I had to force myself to read it to the end hoping that there was some grain of use in the book - I didn't find one. There are no remarkable insights at all and everything in the author's documented experiences were so completely obvious to anyone in the same situation that it made me wonder why anyone would bother publishing this nonsense. Ask any pilot about their learning experiences and you will get much more valuable insights, useful information and more interestsing commentary than anything in this book."
5,percussive thrills,"Earl Harvin is a master drummer who creates pure magic on the stage and in the studio. It's amazing to me that he seems to know exactly when to kick in the drumming and then when to slide back to let the other instruments be heard. His mastery of the drums is evident in his ability to make the most incredible sounds come out of them. He doesn't just play: he seems to take the instrument on a joy ride from jazz to rock and everywhere in between. He playfully re-arranges the neural connections in your head until you feel high! The high lasts a long time.The overall sound of this accomplished disc is very, very pleasing. I'd agree with the other reviewer who pontificated on the genius of the live show. You really must see it to believe it."
1,Disappointing content,"This book really tells one nothing that cannot be easily gleaned from any number of truly fine books on woody plants (can anyone spell ""Dirr"", after whom the purchase of this book is nearly pointless). I bought this book hoping it would be a fine, narrowly focused tome. But it tells me nothing I did not already know, and suggested nothing that I had not already been made aware of by other truly splendid books. Do not waste your money."
1,Required computer program is ancient,"This is a HUGE disappointment. All the kids love snap circuits and the oldest was excited to move up to the 750. But to do the projects requires the computer disk and the program, and it wouldn't load. So we pulled a directory of files on the disk--and the .exe file is dated 1997! It wants Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0. Give me a break! No way in earth this thing is going to work with Windows 7. All the files are dated 1997 - 2004."
3,Plain Designs,"This book has mostly amazingly simple designs along with few more involved ones.It consists of the four seasons and has around one dozen patterns of flowers and an alphabet for each season. Each page has only one design on it along with its size and number of colors needed which can range from as low as 10 to as high as 250 depending on the complexity of the design. The charts are all placed at the end of the book,are in black and white and are very clear to follow. The designs are not very original,one can find similar designs easily in other cross-stitch books."
2,Very disappointing...not at all what I had expected.,"Maybe I misunderstood what this book was all about before I bought it, but it was a big disappointment. I'm a therapist who tries to encorporate humor in my work, and I had thought this book would help by providing ideas for how to do this in the form of case vignettes, etc. While the author does provide short case examples at times, overall, the book is much more philosophical/theoretical. Very little time is spent addressing how humor is used in therapy; rather, the book looks at the history of humor and how humor develops in individuals. If you are a therapist looking for a book to assist with your work, you are unlikely to find this book helpful."
5,Young's Best Album of the 1990s,"Ragged Glory is Neil Young's best album since ""Rust Never Sleeps,"" and not coincidentially the most rockin'. That a bunch of forty-ish hippies who should have followed Young's advice and burned out long ago could produce a guitar dominated album of such intensity is simply astonishing. Most surprisingly, tucked amid the walls of guitar fury are some of the prettiest melodies Young has ever written. Standout tracks include ""Over and Over,"" ""Country Home,"" and ""Days That Used to Be"" An absolute classic."
2,Left me Flat,I don't know. I consider myself a pretty big Neil Young fan but this record is just plain boring. Nothing to really discerne one song from the next. Similar tempo throughout. Meandering guitar solos that really go nowhere. Truth is I might even like some of these songs if they were half as long. Disappointing in my opinion. Noy sure what all the hype is about on this one.
2,Ralph Molina is the world's worst drummer,"His constant banging on the cymbals is so annoying. Neil should have gotten rid of him 40 years ago. People need to believe me. If you don't believe me, just listen to the sample Amazon provided of ""Love and Only Love"". The cymbals are awful (listen before you write some knee jerk comment).Start listening for the cymbals in songs and you will soon agree with me that any drummer who bangs on the cymbals with every beat is annoying, uncreative and stinks out loud. If Neil weren't so great on guitar, Ralph would have reduced every song they made together to an unlistenable mass of clanging."
1,Edited stuff,"I'm 15. I'm a guy. I'm an american. AND I ADMIT DBZ IN AMERICA IS NOT AS GOOD AS DBZ IN JAPAN. Good, I've got that out of the way. I've rated other videos, and I've given five stars because they deserved five stars! The problem with American DBZ, is a lot of stuff is dubbed. That is why I only rate uncut versions, with the exception of this one. Yeah, cut versions stink. No doubt about that, but the people who watch them, that's their choice. I watch uncut because I can't find subtitles and I like DBZ pure."
3,No biggee,"This protective filter is a necessity for an expensive lens so why don't they make it part of the lens purchase? Because they know we will have to purchase it anyway and that is more dollars in their till. So so ... no biggee. Amazon did their job well. Merchant did their job well. I just wish manufacturers would quit charging an arm and a leg for a mass produced ""in China"" items that should be included in the price of the item."
4,Nikon quality and price.,"I always use a neutral or UV filter on all my lenses for protection. It's just common sense and relatively inexpensive protection. Good, typical Nikon build quality, arrived well packed and on time. If it were a bit less pricey, I would have given it 5 stars."
5,A hot jazz instrumental recording,"This is a very sharp recording of some great jazz standards by Ruby Braff and George Barnes. They are both not as well known (and underrated) to many jazz fans, but their style is distinct, crisp, and very fun. Its like sitting in a jam session with some great musicians. These guys know their music and instruments well, and it comes through on this CD. If you really enjoy jazz guitar (a la Barney Kessel) this is the album for you."
4,Reviewing Live at the New School,"This is a good CD especially if your a George Barnes fan. He demeonstrates some great interplay with Ruby Braff and Mr Braff's solos are lyrical and wonderful. This isn't my favorite of the George Barnes material that's out there however. If I had to choose one recording of George's that I came across on Amazon than that would have to be ""Gems"" with Joe Venuti. His playing sounds more lively than on this recording. That being said, the tune choices are great. I love thier versions of ""There Will Never BE Another You', 'Sunny Side of Street', and 'Cheek to Cheek."" If you play guitar like me then there are a lot of great licks to ""cop"" but if you only have enough bucks for one CD then get ""Gems"" instead."
1,Little to do with liviing abroad,"I couldn't have been more disappointed by this book. It was 95% basic finance topics and 5% dealing with finances for living abroad. And the 5% was so basic that it was barely worthwhile. Not only was the book mistitled for it's content, but the style was condescending and repetitive. It's the first time that I'll be returning a book to Amazon.com"
1,Not about living overseas at all!,"I am seconding the earlier review posted which made the point that this book contains largely generic financial advice, with almost nothing related to living overseas. A _big_ disappointment."
1,Deceptive Title,A better title might be: Basics of Personal FinanceI did not find this book helpful at all with regards to the financial considerations of moving and living abroad.
5,The Best Candy Ever,This is my favorite all time candy ever. It has all the best characteristics I ever would want soft chewy and sour. This is a must buy if your in love with these kinds of food like I am.
4,"Great Game, but...","This game is awesome, everything I was expecting, but I think the WII version was more challenging and more interactive. In the WII version you can choose your location of your home, choose where you hunt, fish, harvest, etc. In this game, well, it's a game. Like a platform version where every detail of your castaway journey is already mapped out for you and you just follow the bread crumbs to the end. There is only one way of playing and it's kind of repetitive. It's fun although, but I wish my daughter never broke my WII. This is just as good...kind of."
2,Not the Best...,"I love Sims games, but this one didn't do it for me especially on the DS. I was disappointed because the only part I enjoyed was to squish the bugs with my stylus. I would not recommend this game to Sim fans because it might change their opinion on Sims."
3,Okay at first...,"I was really excited about getting this game after reading the enthusiastic reviews about it. I was not disapointed at first. The game had an incredible story to go along with it, and you learned to survive. But it was very annoying how you had to constantly fill your needs at the same time. Also, almost all the foods had a downside to them. For example, the food could increase your stomach but decrease your hygiene.I had expected much moer from this game, and it could be much better."
2,Not so fun.,"I love puzzles and I love Sims so from what I gathered from other reviewers (on Amazon and elsewhere), I figured this would be something I'd enjoy--despite some of the reviews being bad.At first it was kind of fun, but then it became tediously boring. I will confess that I'm usually really bad about beating games: I think I've actually beat four or five in my lifetime--and I spent months (Zelda LTTP and OoT). I finished this game in about a day and a half and felt totally unsatisfied. It was really, very boring.Fortunately, I sold mine in the marketplace and have since purchased the Zelda game--which has been very entertaining."
4,Lots of fun!,"Entertaining, engrossing, and fun. It's so much fun, in fact, that even though I've found the ship that will let me leave the island, I'm not taking it yet. I want to stick around and play more!"
4,Good Game!,"The graphics aren't the best but its fun...really really fun to me anyway. But at this moment I am stumped, it is for maybe 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders?? I enjoy it though."
3,So So,This one is not so fun. It's hard to collect the things you need to craft the tools. Not to mention trying to figure out what the conversations are that the characters are having with each other.
4,"OK, I'm hooked.","This is my favorite DS game.After doing all of the quests for my fellow castaways, I got off the island, but couldn't resist going back to see if I could find %100 percent of the island items.I couldn't put it down."
5,Addictive Survivor Sims,"This is my favourite Nintendo DS game. It's really addictive because there's so much to do - fulfilling quests for other stranded sims, trying to improve your tools, your hut, your clothes, your food supply. I like how it makes you think ""now how do I get that?"" It's challenging and stimulating and although it can be frustrating trying to find some of the rare items, it's such a buzz when you finally get them and can accomplish your task. The minigames are great and take some practise to master. I like the fishing best - each type of fish has its own personality. It has great replayability value as well."
4,A terrific Nintendo DS game!,"Purchased for my daughter for her birthday, The Sims 2: Castaway has been hours of fun for her. The complexity of the Sims game means it doesn't get old. This game is better for older kids, as it requires strategy and persistence to raise your level and do well at the game. A wonderful game!"
4,Cool!,"This game is really fun. There's always something to do whether you need to find food, make new objects and clothing, and overall exploring the island. I was addicted to this game when I got it. I've had it for a few months and i still have'nt completed the game or gotten bored of it. Some games i've gotten for my ds were too easy and i'd be done in a few days, but the sims 2 castaway keeps you busy. I've also had the sims 2 apartment pets and got bored pretty quickly. You just do the same thing over and over but this sims game is really fun and challenging. I would recommend this to anyone that likes the sims and a good challenging game."
3,"Cheep, But You Get What You Pay For","This is far from the best dance video I have bought. Kyle Webb tries to do too much, and yet accomplishes little. The video tries to teach three styles of swing dance (Jitter Bug, East and West Coast), and does a fair job introducing each. But the video lacked any true depth and so moves were repeated between two styles so the students learn even less. This video covers about as much material as a 30 minute introductory class that you can take before almost any dance. There are better videos from amazon."
2,Cheaply made,I was so excited and I thought it was a middle price..it appeared to get ok reviews for over 30.00 you think it would at least get the job done. It looked like it was splitting in half..the black part the lense falls off/not attached. Don't know what to order next that is affordable.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"This product was prompt in getting here however, I found it to be a bit lacking in what I had intended to use it for at first but by working with the size of the pictures intended to be enlarged it did work out pretty well."
3,Fair for the price,It is not the perfect solution but it gets the job done.I had to really move both the canvas I was drawing on as well as the Tracer to get it to really focus.
2,meh.,"you get what you pay for on this one. i don't think its a piece of junk, but it's not super great either. i used it to transfer a chevron image onto a wall, then to paint over. its hard to move this and get the exact image again."
3,projector,this item will do small jobs...your picture has to be small or you can't get the whole thing onto the wall...i tried it on a picture that was 5 inches...and i thought that by doing it in increments that it would work...but because it would not project the whole picture on the wall it made it hard for me to see that by doing it in stages the picture was too big for the piece of paper that i had chosen to use....there for i had to do the project twice to achieve the right results....okay for children
4,Worked Very Well!,"I bought this to help me with my christmas decor. I found the pictures that I wanted on the internet and then used the tracer to increase the size from 4 inches to 4 feet and trace the images onto coroplast. I worked very well. You can see the results for your self at my website... www.cereschristmastreelane.com/Coroplast.htmlI was surprised that it used a CFL. I thought that this was kinda nice since the heat produced by a CFL is much less than incandescent. But you must remember that the CFL when first turned on is fairly dim and takes a while to get to full brightness. Still, I found that I needed to get the ambient light down to a minimum in order to use this effectively."
4,Small but works great,"This is a great little projector for the price. Works well but tends to get a little hot on papers underneath, could use a little stand to sit on we used an old tile. Grand Children loved it. Given as Christmas present, for use as drawing of book covers and art projects. Worth the money. Julia in NC"
3,Does the job... if it's small...,Smaller than anticipated. Had to piece together a standard 8.5x11 picture to get it up on the canvas.
4,Does its job,I bought this as a way to speed my painting hobby along and it does its job. Room has to be pitch dark to see everything but for the price I'll deal!
2,disappointing,"The quality of this video was very mixed, some quite old and very poor.Some of the episodes were very superficial and hardly told you anythingabout the towns being shown. Would not have purchased it if I had seen itbefore purchase."
1,What audacity! Don't listen to this man.,"As an African American, I am offended that a man who was convicted by the SEC of recording illusory profits and deceiving his firm would have the nerve to advise other blacks about anything. This man's principle talent is remaining a megalomanic in spite of all kinds of evidence that he is a unprincipled charleton. Mr. Jett, I have some news for you, you are not the only black to have ever gone to an ivy league school, traveled the world and made lots of money. Some of us are just modest about it and more focused on helping others than on self-aggrandizement."
4,Good storage,"This bowls are excellent for storage.. the lids dont come off, and they are sooo easy to put on and get off.. unlike some other items. They clean up so much easier than other plastic types. I have 2 sets of these, there an excellent buy."
3,"oops,","product came broken, but amazon was good to work with. they replaced it promptly. the set of storage containers matches the set perfectly, very pleased with the purchase."
3,Lid doesn't fit properly,"The plastic lids are a useless feature because they don't fit. Other than that, the product is fine."
5,"Cook, cover, carry or store.",These are great for baking the lid then makes them terrific if you are taking the food for a dinner. Lids fit and bowls are heavy. I have not burned anything because of the thick bowls. Clean up is a breeze.
5,Easy N-draft upgrade,"I recently upgraded to an N-draft wireless router. Unfortunately my HP 2710p tablet notebook came equipped with a G wireless card. The new N-Draft provides 2x's the wireless speed over G.Rather than purchase an external wireless network card for my HP2710p tablet notebook, I simply ordered the Intel wireless WifI mini card, carefully opened my the bottom cover of the 2710p, removed (2 screws and two push on wires) the old wifi card and installed the new card. I then went to the HP site and downloaded the current Intel wifi drivers. I selected the Intel card because it is approved by HP so the 2701p's BIOS would recognize it. This is very important.Easy upgrade, if you're comfortable taking things apart, for about 1/2 the price of an external wifi adapter. I like the built in design."
1,Wireless Wifi Link Mini Card,"An expensive overrated product.Problems experienced with wireless signal constantly dropping. Unable to view available wireless networks within range. Both of these of were regardless of location. Resorted to using a USB based competitor product, which worked flawlessly first time, every time.IMO, would not recommend anyone wasting the time or expense on this product."
5,"wam,bam, thank you","very easy install, seems to work just fine. I installed it in a Dell 1705 inspiron notebook with vista. Vista failed to install the drivers automatically but the CD worked and I was connected. I went to the web site and updated the drivers. 10 minutes, max!"
1,Intel hopes buyers are too dumb to tell the difference.,"I just bought 2x 4965AGN's and both were Model:4965AGN but Version:4965AG_ In short, it's 802.11G with multiple antennas, not 802.11N (specifically, according to Intel, N is hardware disabled). Since multiple antennas is the most prominent feature of 802.11N, Intel thought they'd just go and peddle these off to the unsuspecting buyers as if it were true 802.11N. BEWARE! Read the label or find out from the buyer first.Version 4965AG_ MM1 is not 802.11N!!Per Intel: 4965AG_ (supports 802.11a/b/g with Draft-N functionality disabled)http://www.intel.com/network/connectivity/resources/doc_library/tech_brief/316286.pdf"
4,Description should say this does NOT work in Lenovo/IBM laptops in the specs,"Purchased this hoping to help my T61 with transfer rates. However, upon opening the package found a disclaimer stating this will not work on any Lenovo/IBM laptops!! Would've been very helpful if this information was in the initial description. I ended up using it a Dell that I have and found the speed to be only half of what is promised. Installation was easy enough if you know your way around the slots."
5,"The real deal, and WELL worth the price!","Having seen the various Intel wireless-n cards with 802.11n actually disabled, I was as skeptical about this product as some other reviewers, but the seller responded quickly with his confirmation that these cards are in fact completely functional. It took significant tweaking of the settings of my router (D-Link DIR-655) to connect to the card (in my Dell XPS M1210), but the effort was well worth it. I now have tripled my wireless read/write performance, without adding yet another external widget to my laptop. Thanks for Paul for offering a great product at a reasonable price and standing firmly behind it with his support!"
3,largely outdated; mostly for those interested in history,"This book was published in 1976 by IEEE and consists of approximately 40 articles published in various journals on the topics of physics and design of silicon and compound semiconductor solar cells. The original publication dates of these articles range between 1954 and 1973. Some of them are ""classical"" publications in which first working solar cells were reported, or first studies of the impact of various parameters of semiconductors, such as bandgap or temperature, on cell performace. The technology of solar cells has progressed enormously since these works (and this book) were published. Therefore, it is no longer a good reference for scholars in the PV area. Nonetheless, it is a great resource for those who are interested in the history of photovoltaics, or those who want to trace the developments in solar cell technology back to their roots."
4,What You Need is What You Need if You're Just a Beginning Fan.,"I began listening to INXS in my early 20s, but this is my first video collection. I will say that the title isn't misleading. You get exactly what it says: the video hits. I will have to check out the DVD the other reviewers have recommended here, because I was hoping for a bit more myself.In any case, if you're a newcomer to the band, you will quickly come to realize just how badly missed lead vocalist Michael Hutchence is because his presence was just that strong. The man oozes pure sex appeal, and I still maintain after 16 years that he would have made a better Jim Morrison in the Doors movie than Val Kilmer (No, I'm not knocking Val, because he was good!). You will also observe a band who delivered very solid videos, but their music was the kind that stood on its own. As a first video, it's a substantial place to start, but now I'm curious about the Only Looking DVD. Hoping this one is your stepping stone as well."
1,inxs what you need,It would be nice to reveiw this product if it had the right area code so i could play it is there a chance to get one that does have the right area code please there was no problem with the other onelive baby liveThank You
4,My mother loved it!,It was just what my mother wanted -- something easy to read and use. And it came with a special pen. Good gift for anyone!
4,Nice big book - ample writing space and pages for my 82 year old mother,My mother has 5 or 6 different address books going and was wanting to get one that she could combine all of them into one. This is a nice big book. Lots of quality pages. Lots of space for writing. The spiral binding is nice - makes it much easier when Mom is writing in the names and addresses.
3,Big Print,BIG print!!! Lots of space for addresses. It does look like a visual aid book but since I couldn't see a picture of the page online I took my chances.
1,Joni Jame Platinum and Gold hits,This album is a misrepresentation. Only 4 selections are gold hits.Since I have all her songs and albums. The rest of her selections on the CD are from obscure recordings of hits done by other people. It is too bad all her good orginal hits are not on the CD.
4,Very Good But .....,"A very good collection would have been even better if so many of Joni's Top 30 hits had not been omitted. The CD opens with her first smash hit, ""Why Don't You Believe Me?"" which again reminds us why Ms. James made such a impact upon the music scene in the Early 50s."
5,"Wild, absurd, relentless fun!!","If the boys in this show have sought to make viewers envious of their characters' carefree, reckless lifestyle that favors weed and beer and partying over anything resembling responsible behavior, then mission accomplished. As I watch this hilarious show, I am left with a void, knowing I will never be able to lift weights while on the clock, make a fort in my cubicle (I actually don't even work in a cubicle), run down my boss in my car, surf for porn, set up a sting operation for a pedophile, and constantly frame and prank my co-workers. Ridiculous, offensive, moronic. Wonderful!"
5,Still torqued.,"I got on this show about five episodes into the season, and it was so good i actually got a Hulu Plus account just so I could watch the first couple episodes i missed. It's outrageous and insane and everything comedy should be. The commentary is hilarious too. They crack beers and drink right through the season. It'd be a good idea for you to do the same."
5,great!!,great show... i don't think it could get much more hilarious than this!no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!
3,What about the music?!,"Upon opening my package, I found a sticker attached to the front of the box which said, ""Includes download code for 3 free songs from The Wizards 'Purple Magic'."" I was pretty excited about it until I opened the case and found that there was no code card. The DVDs are there, but where's my free music?!"
3,Wtf?,"I was so excited to receive this. I got it out of the mailbox, ready to pop in that first disc, and what did I find? The 2 disc edition of Finding Nemo. I still give them 3 stars, only because I love Finding Nemo."
5,Tight butthole.,"This series came from a unicorn's tears. I suggest watching this series to anyone that has a mildly crude sense of humor, it's amazing. POOP DOLLA'"
4,Overall great show.,"Funny show, its one of my favorites but I thought that I was getting some free Wizard music videos with a code and there was not code in the package."
5,Hillarious,"Love the show- I am addicted to it, it is too funny. Will definately be buying the season!!! There is no other show like it"
2,"I couldn't get into it, at all!","I thought this would be so funny, but I'd just fall asleep and let my boyfriend watch it. He didn't think it was funny, either. The timing just wasn't right, but the premises seemed like they SHOULD have been hilarious."
5,Classic,"One of my all time favourite albums, finally wore out my cassette, had to go digital. Truly an great album from a great artist."
5,great cd,"I bought this cd for my dad as a gift. He had this album on a cassette tape, but had lost it. He loves the quality of sound on the cd and listens to it often."
5,"Was realy pleased with lay out, and the style of the music.",This has to be one of my favorite CD's. I wore out my first copy and am working on number two! I can't praise this album enough!
5,Just a super album,"I have had this CD for over a year. Every time I listen to it, I just love it. Obviously, this is a genre that he loves and it shows. Just a throughly nice album."
4,Cowboy Songs,"I would have given this guy 5 stars if he hadn't knocked me out of my Red River gig many years ago. But anyway, these are classic cowboy tunes, tastfully redone. In a word--great.Jim M."
5,Overlooked in other reviews,"One thing that I noticed was overlooked in the posted reviews was the seamless performance of the band. If you have a chance to hear this CD, but especially if you have the chance to see the PBS video you will see what I am saying. The fiddle performance is absolutley awesome. Some of the best bowing that can be found today in terms of smoothness. And the chord shifts are really, really, good. And the seldome used accordion (in todays bands) is a hit addition as many of the simplier groups used such an instrument through the 30's to the 60's. Tops! All are on the same scale as the Grammy winning performers of Asleep at the Wheel. Enjoy the music!"
4,Ordinary Diff. Equations book,Got the book I requested in a timely fashion. Can't ask for better than that.
5,A smashing good war story coupled with mythos goodness...,"an excellent speculative work into the most enigmatic of mythos races, the Great Race. Well worth the read for any die hard Lovecraft fans."
4,very entertaining,A very entertaining story that is well written and captures the lovecraftian theme well.While there are a few tings that could be improved it kept me entertained and had a few very interesting twists.
3,Great Plot But....,"It would perhaps have been nice if the book was actually proof read before publication. Full of typing and grammatical errors not to mention a few historical inaccuracies (so we British were using pound coins in 1943....?) Given the prices that these types of work command due to limited print runs and the intense following of the genre I would expect a little more care and attention to be put in before publishing. That said, a wonderful plot and a fine augmentation to the DELTA GREEN role playing game."
2,How to ruin a good read,"What could otherwise have been an entertaining and useful additional to the Delta Green back-story is simply ruined by poor research, obvious stereotyping, and horrendous punctuation ! I know this may seem a bit petty, but it is frankly impossible to lose yourself in the storyline (of the Nazis' search for legendary Thule and the efforts of the Allied OSS to thwart them) when you are constantly being jarred back to reality by basic factual mistakes (Whitby isn't across the Channel from France !) and some pretty poor typos and chronic punctuation.Don't get me wrong ; I am not sorry I bought and read this book, as its look at the newly formed OSS, the Karotechia and the machinations of the Great Race across time have their place in the otherwise excellent Delta Green ""mini-Mythos"", but when you are just waiting for the next editorial blunder or slack bit of proof-reading, the whole thing just becomes a chore."
4,Quietly interesting,"The Bottom Line:A World Apart focuses on apartheid by looking at a very narrow, child's eye view of the topic; though this precludes the film from being a definitive or comprehensive look at South Africa's most heinous chapter, it doesn't change the fact that this is an engrossing and successful motion picture that manages to be quietly powerful and moving without being manipulative.3/4"
2,Are you a Jerome Karbe Fan?,"I bought this to see Jerome, and guess what, he is in it for 5 minutes.Sorry I bought it."
3,The perfect example of how cameramen/women can destroy a great concert!,"I must write this review. I am so tired and fed-up with poor camera work at concerts. Please take note this review is a critique of the visual and not the audio of this show. Examples: Fiddle solo but camera on Tony Rice looking like he wants to say, ""Hello, like ah, I play guitar and there is a fiddle solo going on over there."" I don't know about you but, I really do not want to see the side of the Mandolin player while Tony is tearing up a superb solo. There are dozens of examples like the ones I mentioned above. What really gets up my nose is that this gig was filmed at Merlefest and I would think they have enough experience to know better. But, I guess not! To be fair here Tony and fellow Musos are all playing extremely well. I just feel the whole show is ruined by lame camera people."
4,Rice & Friends deliver awesome bluegrass musicianship,"Tony Rice and a varied lie up of top bluegrass exponents go all out on this 62 minute concert video. Notable contributors include: Jerry Douglas, Sam Bush, Ricky Scaggs, David Grisman and Mark O'Connor. While the production and sound may not be perfect the enjoyment that these guys have in producing quality bluegrass and the shear effortless musicianship are wonderous to behold. Fans of Tony Rice will marvel at his flatpicking technique and clear vocals. Pleasant variation is provided with the Tony Rice Unit treatment of Lightfoot and other numbers. A must for bluegrass fans."
5,Virtuoso pianist,Dick Wellstood was a virtuoso pianist and a monster musician with a great sense of humor. This album shows him off to great advantage in beautiful duets with Kenny Davern. Basically traditional jazz but it transcends styles. Music to make you smile!
3,worked well until it conked out,"Great shave(the vibration thing really works well) for as long as it worked. I got this for traveling, and don't know what happened, just defective I guess, but after a month it would not turn on anymore. I replaced the battery, but that didn't help. I have another one of these I've used at home every day for several years, and that one still works like new."
3,Very disappointed,I've used the older version of this razor for many years. Decided to get a new one and put in RV. I've used the new razor for about 3 months. It works but the blade part keeps coming off of handle. Wish I could find who sold it to me through Amazon. Definitely needs to be replaced.
4,"Dry, monotonous, but essential if you are trying to make sense of it all...","It reads like ones medical records. Very analytical. But still, if you are trying to get past all of the ""emotional"" writing that's out there, this will clarify some of the confusion (or simply cement the notion that both scenes were horribly confusing, and to highlight just how bad it can get during one of these incidents).There is a lot of writing regarding the local citizen's groups and the Russian news' attempts to discover the government's involvement in the outcomes (particularly Beslan) and to lay blame for what precipitated the violent outcomes. If you are looking for conspiracy theorists, it's all here.A decent primer to go along with ""Beslan: 3 days in September"", probably one of the best docu-treatments of this subject-Beslan (available only on ebay or other CD/DVD sales sites as it was only ""released"" on an ""for your consideration"" Academy DVD in '05-'06 or so) with another movie on the ""b"" side)."
4,Awesome,"I come from Scotch-Irish decent and am very white/ red/ pink. I am more red than I am white. This product is by far the best I've ever tried. Doesn't look fake at all.. Only problem is under direct open sunlight it can kind of shimmer and look a little orange. As always, self tanners are difficult to keep from staining the palms of your hands and at the same time apply to the top of your hands. And are difficult to spread over the entire body without help for your back. But those are universal problems and not unique to this product. It's the most legit looking color I've ever seen for fair skin. Great product. Does have the common self tanner smell , not very strongly but it's there"
1,HORRIBLE!,"I love this product; but DO NOT buy from deals for less ny inc.-the prouduct was not 'lotion' consistency but clearly had water mixed with it and did not smell as the prior lotion I'd ordered of the same brand and type, when I contacted the seller regarding this I got no return email or assistance. Love the product but choose a different seller."
2,Eleni's accont of Madam Bovary,"I thought this book was slow, dull, and all toghter non-entertaining. Madam bovary was a one sided person and through away the important things in life. Very poor novel. Only read it for its very detailed account of French provincial life."
5,Great movie deserving of a DVD,"I look for this movie all the time, and never can find it :( so a friend suggested Amazon and all I can find is a used VHS version of the movie. This movie had some award nominations I think, and it's well acted by everyone in it. So I beg please put it on DVD."
5,only when I laugh,"I so enjoyed this movie from my youth. It is so hard now days to find a drama with such a great cast. I really enjoyed the twenty four hour availability when viewing this feature film. I watched it twice by myself an invited friends over for the third viewing. I would recommend this picture to all those that want a really good drama, one might see a little of ones self in the characters. love it, love it ,love it."
5,RELEASE THIS ON DVD!!!,"This is one of my favorites of all time and like many other reviewers here, I cannot understand why it has not been released on DVD. Marsha Mason, Joan Hackett, and James Coco were all nominated for Academy Awards for this film. Kristy McNichol was not nominated but should have been - the entire cast is perfect. One small quibble that I have always had with the script is that Georgia never goes to an A.A. meeting when she gets out of rehab, which I only realized years later from seeing loved ones is a necessary part of staying sober (not everything in movies can be entirely reality based). The movie is 5 stars and makes me laugh and cry EVERY time I see it. RELEASE THIS ON DVD...please."
5,IT ONLY HURTS WHEN I LAUGH!,"Only When I Laugh [VHS] is a realistic portrait of addiction and recovery.Marsha Mason shines as the actress who struggles with alcohol dependency and sabotages her long-awaited reunion with her teenage daughter (played by Kristy McNichol) by relapsing in a very public, humiliating way.Warmth and humor are the constants in what could otherwise be a very depressing film. But Marsha Mason and Kristy McNichol can be counted on to bring us these elements.We can also rely on James Coco and Joan Hackett to add drama to this poignant tale as the enabling friends who keep the addiction going.I watched this film several times when it first came out, and then had to have the tape. Now I'm hoping it will soon come out on DVD."
4,Why isn't this on DVD,"There are certain movies that I like to buy and watch again and again. This is one of them. Great story, great performances. I'm not sure why it's not on DVD but it should be. I'd buy it."
4,good jigsaw with some flaws,"I got this saw about a month ago and for the most part it seems to be built well and it works very well. The main gripe that I have is when I was cutting some light board the blade would jump off its position to the left of the slots it is supposed to sit in and actually bend it. I adjusted the slot and ended up bending 3 bosch t shank blades. For whatever reason the blade would just cut to the left and ruin my cut even if I went slow. After screwing with it some more it just started cutting fine, and I was using the right blades for the job. As long as it keeps cutting like it is now I give it 4 stars, oh and the case is hard to close unless the cord is perfectly wrapped."
1,Not satisfied,Black and Decker should be ashamed of themselves. To let a product leave the factory damaged as is product was.
4,B&D jigsaw,Saw cuts very easy and smooth thru all types of wood. Wish that bottom plate had better markings for bevel cuts .
3,"Great tv, but lamps don't last","This tv has a great picture quality and the sound is not the greatest but it's ok, now... in 4 years of use I'm going on my 4th lamp. The 1st was $109.00, second was $89.00, and the one I'm about to buy is $59.00. I think I'm getting rid of it and getting an LCD or LED to replace it..."
1,the WOW won't last,"as most of your were i was thrilled with my tv purchase. in 4 years i am on my 4th bulb. but just wait until you start getting the white spots all over your screen, they grow at a rate of 2-3 MORE every couple of days. this is from the color wheel going bad. and how 'bout around a grand to fix that. i've had my MITSUBISHI WD57733 as i said for 4 years, unfortunatley, i paid closer to 2K for it. I CAN NOT STRESS ENOUGH,.............DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
1,Sucks,"The picture is great, but we've spent hundreds of dollars on replacement lamplights because they keep going out every few months.It's getting expensive to keep this tv and honestly, the hassle is more than a little annoying. I wish we'd read reviews and bought a different (better!) brand before jumping the gun on this one."
2,$250 bulb replacement cost. DO NOT EVER BUY,"Ok, so ask the salesman about your warranty on this tv set. I bought mine in September 2008 for $1199 plus $375 for the 5 year warranty (which I found out the hard way does NOT cover bulb replacement). The blew out in 15 months, which I guess is common within 1.5 to 2 years. However, the replacement bulbs for this set are $249. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SPEND A FEW EXTRA BUCKS ON A PLASMA OR LCD, you will thank me later."
1,Know before you buy,"I have a WD52528 which is basiclly the same set. In two years I had the Store, where I bought it and in warranty, replace the light engin and mirror. Less than another year I replace the lamp, that one was my cost. What I see is if this set is not in a VERY CLEAN enviroment, you will have problems with things like dust, cooking, etc. It will become a very expensive set to maintain and keep the origional picture quality that you start with. I fyou buy it get a life time warranty!"
4,"Great TV, but...","Happy with the TV, however, I am a ""noise-person"". The littlest noises can drive me crazy, and this TV made a low hum from the day we bought it. Actually tried to bring it back, but through many problems with Conn's (don't shop there!), we ended up keeping it. Did some looking around on the internet and apparently this hum is common with Mitsubishi TVs. It has something to do with the color wheel technology they use. Anyways, I can zone the hum out when watching shows, so I can live with it. Some people don't even notice the noise until it's pointed out. Besides, the picture quality is great, and it was very inexpensive for such a large size. If you think you may have a problem with the low hum, make sure you know about the return policy wherever you buy it from... including any restocking fees."
5,"OUTSTANDING T.V., Great Value","I purchased the Mitsubishi WD-57733 T.V. on December 11, 2007. I can only say one word to describe it, (OUTSTANDING). Setup was a breeze. The picture is just out of this world. My biggest surprise was the built in sound system, a real delight to my ears. Connections galore. I have not purchased a high-definition DVR yet. I just used my progressive scan Yamaha DVR to watch Polar Express and WOW, I felt like I was actually there. Mitsubishi really got it right with this T.V. I highly recommend this item."
3,"Good Technothriller, not-too-beleivable-ending","A Good technothriller from the days of the cold war, this book will keep the reader interested. Not Unlike Melville's Moby Dick, the captain of a U.S. Navy Destroyer plays a cold war game of cat-and-mouse with a Soviet submarine resulting in a tragic climax. It is a real page turner and my only problems with the book were the character of the journalist Munceford, who is too peripheral to the story and a little too annoying (see Sidney Poitier's performance in the movie for a better depiction); and the ending was not terribly believable considering the circumstances (again, see the movie for a better ending) Overall, I would recommend this book, but there are other, better titles that should be read first: Fail Safe; On The Beach; Trinity's Child and Viper Three"
4,Great re-telling of Moby Dick,"This book is a great re-telling of Moby Dick, set in the 1960's cold war era. The story concerns a destroyer in the North Atlantic whose mission is to seek out Russian submarines, and force them to surface. Once the submarines surface, they are photographed, and the game starts again. The problem occures when one Russian submarine proves to be too ellusive, and the Captain of the American destroyer takes it personally, as his own white whale. If you enjoy Tom Clanncy's techo-thrillers, this is an early example of the genre. If you have any Navy experience, I think you'd enjoy this book."
4,Saved me from embarassment!,"Because I write a lot of technical materials, I totally misinterpreted what an agent told me about sending in an outline. If I had not gotten this book I wouldn't have known that outlines for novels are very different from technical outlines. I verified this with people ""in the know"" and have started redoing my novel outline in the RIGHT format."
3,One of the most bizarre books I have ever encountered!,"This book is an explanation of ""difficult points in learning Chinese"" but it is WRITTEN IN CHINESE! Granted, the Chinese is mostly elementary, but I cannot figure out who the audience for this book would be. I suppose this is most appropriate for native Chinese speakers to help them teach Chinese as a second language. It is NOT appropriate for beginners struggling to learn these points on their own. Best of luck."
4,Interesting book,"Similar to other wealth thinking books, Siebold offers a view inside the minds of how the rich think and their attitudes on life."
3,Not a lot new here,"It's a good reminder and a handy reference on how to keep on doing what you need to, but I didn't find a whole lot new in this book."
5,177 Mental Toughness,This book is very informative and definitely worth looking at. I enjoy the read and put it to everyday use. Great READ!!!
5,"a must read, don't look back","this book is a must. any more in this world one must be mentally tough. the world is not always pretty there will be some obstacles. Like I say "" this is just a hill for a mountain climber"". I recently started with a new company ""world financial group"" which has a lot of great leaders in it from Ed Mylett to Eric Olsen to Paul Hart and Gabby Beltran to Elan Micheals to Manny Valle there are a lot of great people who want for people to be successful in life. Its amazing what one can do with the right association life. My company wanted for us to get this book to read it for self development. What other company out there has the employees get books for self development. Remember we can always do better some way shape or form. Before I go I wanted to give special thanks to my lady Crystal Elsea."
1,A pedestrian history,"Mannix's book is not a serious work of history. It can be read as interesting diversion, but should not be understood as an accomplished work of scholarship. In fact, there are some quite implausible claims made throughout. For example, Mannix claims that the end of judicial torture in the 18th-century could be attributed primarily to Beccaria's humanistic tracts! This is simplistic to say the least. After the work of Langbein, however (see Torture and the Law of Proof), this claim is simply undefensible. Moreover, Mannix fails to adequately distinguish the different theaters of torture, leading to far too many general claims (on punitive torture, one cannot do better than Foucault's Discipline and Punish, his hyperbole not withstanding).An accurate portrayel of the complex judicial and punitive changes that led to the previous abolition of legalized torture requires much more nuance--let alone attention to detail and source documents!"
1,Chilton's Mazda Trucks 1987-93 Repair Manual (Includes Mazda,The book is written poorly. It is very difficult to find what your looking for. It caters mostly to the latest vehicles. The book is nowhere near the asking price. The book belongs in a junkyard.
3,Mazda MPV Chiltons,"Try to get the Haynes version.This Chiltons book is poorly laid out, on poor quality paper and I suspect that the writer(s) have not totally stripped down the Mazda MPV in order to write this book"
4,"real cool, but not all piano boogie woogie","This is another collection of cool 30's & 40s blues, but more big-band blues than per-se piano boogie woogie. Quality is similar to, or superior to, Membran's supercheap box sets. This has plenty of notes, but they're all in German. Not that much overlap with the 10 CD ""Boogie Woogie"" on Membran.Boogie Woogie (10 Cd Box Set) 200 Songs- Original MastersWell worth the bargain price. Obviously, sourced from fairly rare and often battered 78's."
4,Great introduction to a brilliant and tortured mind,"This short, potent, megalomaniacal rant is probably the best introduction to the thinking of Freud's most brilliant and mercurial disciple.At 120 pages, copiously and vividly illustrated by William Steig, it can be read in a brief sitting.Though it was written after Reich's fateful turn down the dead-end hall of orgone research, it contains the most important insights of his earlier psychotherapeutic work, and is a compelling critique of the mass-psychology of life under mature capitalism.Those whose interest is piqued by this salvo would do well to investigate Reich's more measured and focused contributions such as his early writings in ""Character Analysis"" and ""Sex-Pol""."
5,This is a must-have!,"This recording has been my current favorite for over a year, and I have hundreds of classic jazz recordings colelcted over 37 years. I got it because of Vic Dickenson, and soon realized there were many stellar performances here. My dad with 30 years more jazz appreciation experience considered the keyboard work from Dave McKenna to be the stellar feature and I'd say it is deserving of equal billing with Hackett and Dickenson. Sugar (by Maceo Pinkard) and Struttin' (by Louis Armstrong) are unreplicatable masterpieces! This recording from 1970 is a must-have."
1,Abandon should ber abandoned,"I give this one star because there is no lower mark. As an avid reader, this has to be an all time low of the all time lows in my 70 years of reading! It escapes me how any reader could find something in this novel to enable a movie to be written. Makes one wonder if Desmond had some pull in the movie industry before he wrote this horrendous tome.If there were anyone I truly despised, I would recommend this book to them. A perfect waste of one's time~"
5,Great Book ...,"...I truly enjoyed the novel; it makes you work to put the story together, and the author throws in twists and turns every step of the way. If you enjoy movies like: American Beauty, American Psycho, eXistenZ, Johnny Darko, Seven, or other movies that don't provide a straight forward, easy to digest message and challenge you to create your own - then you will enjoy this novel. I cannot think of a single novel to compare it to.... and it provides hours of discussion because it is so interesting to work through as you try to pull together what did or may have happened. Is there a ghost? Is the story a lie? Who is the narrator? Who died? Did they really die? It is a dark novel, but it is fun."
1,Abandon...hope all ye who pick up this novel,"Abandon sounded promising. I was prepared for a quick, scary read. But what I got was neither.I'm normally a very quick reader, flying through books. So I knew there was something wrong when it took me a week to read Abandon. The problem wasn't me, it was the book. Almost nothing happens in the novel. It's slow moving and, quite frankly, boring. Much of the narrative is repetitive, focusing on the inner turmoil a narrator we don't know enough about to care. Characters are poorly developed, the action isn't well plotted and the entire book moves in fits and starts. And as our narrator describes his ""descent into hell"" things only get more confused and more boring.Desmond's attempt to write a more literary horror novel fails in almost every respect. By the time I reached the last page, I just didn't care anymore. The verdict: don't bother."
1,Cracked,"I might have given this product more stars, however it came broken. Much smaller than I would have liked. They need to work on adding additional packing to prevent breaking."

5,"By far, the best dballz episode i've ever seen so far.",This was the episode which I spent at least an entire month waiting to see. I was very pleased when Goku transformed into what Vegeta so desperately wanted to become. It was very clear that Freeza didn't stand a chance after super saiyan goku emerged. I'm ready to see Freeza pay for what he did to my boy vegeta.
4,Lovers of Heroic Fantasy will enjoy this book!,"Jirel of Joiry is a haunting, powerful fantasy that takes place back in Dark Age France sometime after the fall of Rome. Jirel, with her red hair and two-handed longsword, is the literary ancestor of such present day swordwomen as Red Sonja. The stories are vibrant and bold, depicting their settings very realisticly. In alot of ways, the stories are every bit as good as Howard's Conan stories. My only reservation is that the stories have a very 30's pulp feel to them (probably because that was when they were written). All in all an excellent read."
4,Classic Science Fiction,From the rear cover:These are the classic tales of blood and honor that catapulted C. L. Moore into legendary ranks of such acclaimed writers as Robert E. Howard and Edgar Rice Burroughs in the golden age of sword and sorcery. First published in the magazine Weird Tales in the 1930's.
2,A good story needs characters . . .,"I picked this book up at a Salvation Army store for about 50 cents, and I'm glad that's all I paid. I have no problem with strong female warrior types, but Jirel does not do them justice. As the editorial review notes, Jirel is a little stupid, and it is often her uncontrolled emotions rather than her courage or her bravery that get her out of sticky situations. As a heroin, I just couldn't bring myself to root for her to win. My biggest complaint, however, is the lack of other characters in most of the stories, especially the Black God stories. Moore undoubtedly spent a great deal of time writing 30 pages of description of strange alien worlds, but after the first 10 pages they get a little boring. A good story needs more than one character to keep up the reader's interest. In this respect, the final story in this collection, Hellsgarde, was a pretty good story, and much easier to read because there were several interesting characters."
3,Rod Stewart regaining his strenght,"It doesn't come close to the magnificent ""Every Picture Tells A Story"", but compared to Rod Stewart's awful 80s output, ""Vagabond Heart"" is actually a pretty strong and quite diverse album.The production is a bit slick, but Stewart's performance is soulful and sincere, and ""Vagabond Heart"" includes a great cover of Runrig's ""Rhythm Of My Heart"", a couple of very good originals (""Rebel Heart"", ""When A Man's In Love""), the radio-friendly duet with Tina Turner, ""It Takes Two"", a fine rendition of Van Morrison's beautiful ballad ""Have I Told You Lately"", and a swinging rendition of Larry John McNally's ""The Motown Song"".""Vagabond Heart"" is quite heavily influenced by soul music (and less by disco, fortunately), and even though it contains a lot of ""filler"", there are also several really good songs here.Worth picking up for Rod Stewart-fans (unless they're only fans of his disco-period in the 80s).3 1/2 stars."
2,Just bad.,"I picked this up because I've really enjoyed several other novels by this author. But this book was just painful to work through. The characters were just insufferable, each one more so than the last. Kayla is needy and pathetic, Val is selfish and a total stereotype and Antoinette is so incredibly off putting and selfish that the ""friendship"" between the three is just painful to read about. The plot is convoluted. Honestly, the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because I did finish it. If you're interested in this author I would recommend Summer People."
3,Beach Read,"Not a lot of substance but a good beach or plane read. Writer does get you to want to finish the book, and sometimes this is not the case."
3,SEE YOU LATER,"This story is perfect for a quick read. If the characters had been fleshed out more, their motives clearer, it could have had more of an impact. Three women form a friendship on Nantucket that they maintain through the years, but they have little in common. On of them acts deceitfully, drawing the other two into a nasty situation, basically because they're distracted, trying for perfection in their very different lives. The last third of the book seems to have been written hurridly, stretching compassion to a doubtful conclusion."
3,predicatable but satisfying,"No worries, everybody's happy at the end. Pure escapism without a moral or plot twist in sight. Just a good beach read."
2,Nantucket Nights,I'm sorry to write this review but I really didn't like this book. I read half of it then sat it down for several weeks because I lost interest. I came back to it because I don't like to leave a book unfinished and found I was really enjoying the story again. Until the ending! In my view I thought it was awful. As long as you're going to write a book with some chapters going into detail about a specific character at least tie the ends together for the characters instead of finishing of with a quick half--- ending
3,Predictable Format,"Unfortunately, the author continues to use a predictable format. Her novels provide a trip to Nantucket with a good sense of the local scenery, places of interest, etc.; but the emphasis on teenage drinking and sex gets a bit stale after you have read two or three of her novels."
5,Fist Elin Hilderbrand book read but not the last!!,"This is the first Elin Hilderbrand book I have ever read. I was in need of a book to get me until other book order arrived. I really enjoyed this story, couldn't put it down. I loved the way many characters had a chapter or more to get the story from several different views. As soon as I finished this book I ordered another of her books and hope to be as satisfied with the new one as I was with this one."
5,Summer read,Another great read from this author. It would be fun to be a character in one of Elin's books! Please don't stop writing. I can't remember when I have enjoyed reading as much as I have since I discovered this author.
4,Wonderful Summer read,I have read almost all of Elin Hilderbrand's books since being introduced to her a year ago. I find all of her books to be great summer reads full of friendship and love. Nantucket nights was a great book and literally I could not put the book down. Highly recommend and do not believe anyone will be disappointed. ENJOY
1,Not worth the time,"This book was extremely disappointing, the characters are not fully developed, the ""mysterious disappearance"" is cliche and predictable, and the ending is completely unbelievable. The first chapter seemed promising but went downhill fast. Don't waste your time."
4,love her!,I loved this book. I got to around 30% (on my kindle) I couldn't stop! Its engrossing! I follow this author and read everything sure does.
3,Nantucket Nights,"Very, very easy reading! Fun if you have visited Nantucket, as there are lots of place references that you will recognise. A good beach read."
5,A Must Read,"I've read most of Elin Hilderbrand's books and I consider this one to be the best! To the community Kayla Montero seems like the perfect wife, mother and friend. Kayla and 2 other women who she has known for 20 years meet yearly on the Friday night before Labor Day. They call themselves the Night Swimmers. Something happens on the night of their 20th meeting. Over the course of the next 24 hours Kayla's life is completely altered along with that of her husband, Raoul's, and those they are close to or thought they were.This book includes in-depth character studies of Kayla, Raoul, Antoinette and Theo.An absolute must read for summer or for anytime of the year!"
4,Easy read,"I love all of her books. She has wonderful, deep characters that you either love or hate. I also enjoy her description of food."
2,Condition of Book not as Expected!,"Story was wonderful, after all it is an Elin Hilderbrand novel and if based solely on the novel itself, my rating would have been a solid 5 stars. However, this review is also taking in to consideration the ""experience"" of having purchased this product from an on-line source, which is why my rating is so low. I purchased the book from a 2nd party vendor which advertised the book as new and charged the ""new"" price plus a ridiculous shipping fee. But I really wanted to add this book to my collection and couldn't wait to get it. But, upon receiving the book, it was obvious that it was USED; jacket cover was scratched, interior pages were yellow and corners of some pages had ""dog-eared"" indentations that had been folded back. Shame on the seller for advertising NEW and misrepresenting a product that would have most likely brought $1 had she sold it in a yard sale..."
1,Skip this book,I was between books when I picked this up. What I should have done was go to store and buy another book. The story is absurd and the characters are ridiculous. I didn't even bother with the last page and a half. Just a really bad book.
4,Horrible Ending,"I enjoyed this book...until the ending. There were character flaws & some scenes didn't make sense, but that's Ok. It's what reading a novel is: losing yourself in someone else's world. I was ready to recommend this to people, until I found myself quickly approaching the end...& the resolution was not going to be satisfying -or logical. All in all, the majority of the book is good. But the final pages ruined the whole thing."
1,underdeveloped,"This book had too many loose ends and didn't seem finished. The ending was abrupt, disjointed, and incomplete. I didn't like this book and am sorry I wasted my money. The first chapter that I got as a sample was the only good part."
2,There was no ending,"I would hate to give the ending away on any book, but in this case there was no ending. It was like she got tired of writing and just quit! I am normally a big fan, but this book has left me very upset and unsatisfied. I know that the books don't always have an open and shut ending, but this one left way to many unanswered questions for me. I really felt like giving this 1 star, but since I am a fan of the writer and the book held my attention til the end, I went with two. I would not recommend anyone spending money on this book"
2,NOT WORTH THE READING TIME IT TOOK!,"Not my favorite book at all. I didn't find any of the characters likeable. Therefore, their circumstances they brought onto themselves. A missing friend, destruction of a few marriages, destruction of a child's innocence, and the loss of a super job."
1,Incestual!,"To quote one of the characters from the book as they described a key plot in this book; disgusting. I couldn't believe it, you kept reading and it kept getting worse and worse and worse! It was all so sorted and predictable. What a waste!!"
3,Rushed conclusion.,"I agree with a few other reviewers; the end was unstatifying, unrealistic and abrupt. It kept my interest for sure but the Antoinette character is a selfish jerk. (Boy, that's harsh isn't it?) :)"
2,Not one of the author's better books,I was so excited to get another one of Elin's books but was let down by the rather ridiculous plot and the characters. Just could not get into the story line but managed to read the entire book anyway.Wonderful author but this was definitely not one of her best.
3,Not my favorite,"This book was okay. The characters were not that likable, which made it hard to sympathize with any problems they were having, but it was still enjoyable. I like the setting and the writing style of Elin Hilderbrand, the book is a very easy summer read."
2,"Typos, typos, typos.","This book is fairly entertaining, if pretty unbelievable. But the number of typos was so aggravating. Do any publishers use editors anymore, or do they just skate by with spellcheck?"
3,Okay - Not As Good as Some of the Author's Later Novels,"I've read several of Ms. Hilderbrand's later novels and have enjoyed all of them. This earlier novel, not so much. The lead character, Kayla, comes across to me as weak, naive, and not very smart. I believe the writing was supposed to garner sympathy for Kayla and her family for what they were going through, but the only people I felt sorry for in the book were Kayla's three youngest children. I wouldn't recommend this book to friends of mine. The ending was anti-climatic and shows that Kayla didn't learn anything at all about the damage that keeping secrets can do."
3,Nantucket Nights... don't read @ night,"Nantucket Nights took me SEVERAL nights to get through. I didn't like this book very much. I will admit that I finished it... therefore, it wasn't horrible. I had never read this author's work before. I bought 3 of her books and didn't love any of them. However, this was the best of the 3. I probably won't read any of her other work. I typically read Jodi Picolt, Kristin Hannah, and Janet Evanavich; I thought I would give EH a try. I am sad to admit that I wasn't impressed. I am a fast reader, but this book took me DAYS. It never grabbed my attention."
3,Somewhat Predictable,"While I enjoyed reading this book, it definitely left me wanting for more. More character development, chapters on Val and Antoinette, even one on Lindsey. If these three gals are such great friends, why treat each other so deplorably? Let's face it, the plot was rather stupid. What could have been a 'better read' was mediocre...I give it 3.5 stars. The title was one of the more favorable attributes this book had to offer."
4,Gave me the Nantucket Homesick Blues,"As a former resident of Nantucket and not so enthusiastic reader of the author^'s previous book, I opened this one skeptically but surprised myself when I couldn't put it down! This one I thought was fascinating and the characters much more true to the people I knew on the island. Now the only problem is waiting two years for the next book!"
5,Wonderful Nantucket,Excellent Read - My wife and I go to Nantucket every summer and we can't wait to get there and read Ellen's newest book while we are there.
2,Language,"I did not like this book from the very beginning. It had too much of the ""F"" word and talked about smoking weed and having affairs etc. I only read two chapters and tossed it aside. There are too any really good books to read that don't use bad language."
2,I would not have read this book to my daughter,"This is not a book that I would have read to my daughter when she was young. Although the Bobby character possesses a great deal of imagination, it is expressed as direct opposition to parental authority. When his mother calls ""Bobby!"" he refuses to acknowledge the call and pretends to be many things other than the referenced child known as Bobby. The calls from his mother grow more intense and shrill, yet he continues to ignore them. At the end, Bobby grows hungry so he imagines that he is a lion as he walks back into the house. His last statements are ""And they better let me watch TV. Or I'll eat them.""While imagination and inventiveness are always to be encouraged in children, the expression of defiance is an inappropriate one, both in running away and then making threats to the parents. For these reasons, I was not impressed with the book."
1,Not appropriate preschoolers,"I bought this book because I loved Bark, George! I was very disappointed. ""I'm not Bobby!"" is an angry and sometimes violent book. The illustrations exude frustration and the character has malicious thoughts. I bought it expecting a cute story where a boy would decide his parents weren't so bad after all when he got hungry, but even the last page has the main character threatening to eat his parents. Though I imagine first and second graders would like this, it is definitely not right for my preschooler."
2,a bit disappointing,"I loved these adventures when I was younger, but I had a sense that this compilation weren't the originals, that they were either re-written or shortened or something was missing"
5,Love it!,I do not know why I waited so long to buy this skillet. I also bought the 10 inch. We almost exclusively use these skillets. They are great!
5,Excellent pan but the seasoning isn't.,"Luckily there were reviews to warn about the so-so seasoning. I tried mine with the factory seasoning, & food stuck.Don't let this discourage you. After washing it, I seasoned it twice, & it's been working great. 2 things I'd like to share for those who are contemplating cast iron: 1. Use plant based dish soap because it's not as harsh as petroleum based soap. Look for Seventh Generation brand or similar. 2. I seasoned mine with olive oil. After painting the pan with olive oil & a pastry brush, I baked it upside down @ 250 degrees for 2 hours, then applied another seasoning while heating it on the stovetop. FYI: it's going to smoke so ventilate while seasoning. It's really not a chore to do this, & the rewards are well worth it. I use this pan daily with a Lodge grill press to reheat sandwiches, & I'm kicking myself for all those times I used the microwave oven. Like anything else, a little time & effort makes all the difference. I hope this pan outlasts me."
5,Best nonstick skillet you can buy!,The Lodge Pro-Logic Pre-Seasoned 12-Inch Skillet provides a healthy way to saute food without having it stick to your pan. It is well-made and easy to handle even though it is heavy. I recommend it highly!
3,Bottm rusted other than this its great4,"Bottom rusted this kind of strange only used couple times and never leave wet dry with paper towel after each use. Now the bottom might have rusted from scratches over stove, but its large area and also inside lodge pinted label telling me its just rusted because coating was not great. I might reseason it myself.EDIT: i never gave up on this cookware, i seasoned it with vgetable oil, canola, olive i seasoned it like 2 times day for many hours at 400-500F and it still keep rusting every second or thrd time you cook in it.So seasoned it 10 times total still rusts.When something burns to it you cannot clean it without abrasive sponge no matter how many times you boil water in it and coating goes off when you do it so you have to reseason it. And putting oil on it after every use is mandatory or it will rust right away with nasty yellow rust in your food.It might rust while you cook too so avoid this product."
3,QC Issue,"I've used this as my primary skillet for a while now. I'm still shocked at how heavy it is.My skillet has a small chunk of metal in the middle of the skillet. I would need to grind it off to have a smooth surface. Its not a deal breaker, but I expected a smooth interior. I've purchased more lodge logic items since purchasing this skillet and have not had the same problem. Docking 2 stars as this is a quality control issue.I do enjoy cooking with cast iron. I think the ""non stick"" hype is over blown, but the heat retention is worth it.If I were to purchase this again, I'd get a smaller size or a different shape. Trying to slide food from the skillet to a plate is actually a chore with 1 hand."
5,Get this pan!,"I have used this 12 inch pan for over a year now. It is the best cookware I have ever owned. I am retired chef of 40 years so I have some experience with saute' pans! It is heavy so it takes a little more strength to flip stuff but it is not too difficult. I recommend what an earlier reviewer suggested: sanding the pan smooth before use. I did that with this pan and the smaller one and it really made a difference. It only took a few minutes with a sanding mouse to do it. Also, I went and bought a metal spatula to use with it as some stuff sticks a little but it peels right off with the metal spat. You don't have to worry about scratching it, it doesn't matter! After cooking just rinse it out, use a tuffy or green pad while it is still warm (no soap or detergent) then dry it and spray with non-stick spray and store in the oven. I use much less oil with this pan. While I would have worn out two or more teflon coated pans by now this pan continues to get better!"
3,Old school cast iron pan is better,I bought one of these before I had any real experience with cast iron. Now I learned my lesson. This pan is no where close to an old school Wagner traditional cast iron pan. This pan is way heavier. It does not have a grease pouring spout. It does not have a polished surface which makes food stick less. The sides seem too shallow and does not prevent splatter as good as a traditional design. I never reach for this pan anymore. I always go for my Wagner.
2,Mediocrity Not Kept at Bay,"I realize I'm swimming against the tide here and that I will soon have more negative votes than a porcupine has quills. But I dislike ""Magic Time"" a great deal. Simply put, listening to it seems to take too much time and not provide enough magic.Between the harmonica-infused songs that smack of Parchman Farm, the cheesy strings that zap life out of the arrangements on others, the lackadaisical covers, and redone do-wop dullness that permeates several others, little remains to praise other than say Evening Train.Van Morrison has the right, certainly, to make any kind of recording he damn well pleases, but once he set the bar on ""Poetic Champions Compose"" it's a shame he didn't follow the advice he dispenses in the third track here, Keep Mediocrity at Bay."
2,Van mailed this one in,"Two good songs and a lot of junk. Van's not keeping mediocrity at bay, he's producing it."
3,Overrated,"I heard a lot of good things about this release, but it really did not stand up. There are some nice tunes and it's very pleasant sounding, but I would rate it average overall, and below average for Van Morrison. Granted, I don't have a lot of recent releases for Van the Man, so I can't compare to those.Terence Smyth"
3,standard van morrison fare. nothing wrong with that.,"3 and 1/2 stars i would say. this is an enjoyable set, absolutely. there is not really a bad van morrison recording out there (heck, i even get enjoyment from ""a period of transition""), but let's face it: van is not trying very hard here. this is the kind of recording he is so used to making that he could call it in on the phone from home. a little r & b, plenty of mid-tempo stuff with nice tame saxophone, standard blues harmonica and some gentle string arrangement stuff. all nice, all predictable. none of it classic (listen to ""astral weeks,"" or ""veedon fleece,"" for the classic stuff). the only tune here that's close to outstanding is ""gypsy in my soul,"" which is very, very strong. lots of the rest has an almost cheesy las vegas feel to it. and hey, nothing wrong with that; i find it enjoyable, myself. it's just not great. it doesn't even try for great. it is what it is: an easy to listen to piece of entertainment. fine by me."
5,Van Morrison = Greatness,"I use to think that Van would never top his old stuff, but each album is better than the next. I especially love ""Celtic New Year"". Probably my all time favorite song. This whole album is amazing."
3,Better choices out there,"I'm a huge Van ""The Man"" Morrison fan. I've enjoyed his more recent releases...from late 1990s until present day. This one was a little too heavy on the jazz sound than I like from Van. Don't get me wrong...he sounds great. I just prefer a more diverse mix of ballads that takes him across the wide spectrum of different musical sounds and tempos. After about 6-12 plays, you get the feeling that he was just going through the motions on this one. Do I think there are better choices out there...yes. Buy it? Only if it's under $12."
4,Don't Sell Him Out,"Just wanted to disagree with some reviews in that I thought 'They Sold Me Out' is one of the stand out tracks, maybe not for the recurring theme of his record industry history, more for the feel of the song and the 'People get ready' intro. As someone who listens to 90% Soul Music I would say this song is the second most soulful tune on the record after Stranded. A great album and a return to form for Van the Man."
4,Van's on a roll... pay attention.,"Just about everybody on the planet at least knows the name Van Morrison. Who hasn't heard Moondance and Brown Eyed Girl a thousand times over the years? Unfortunately, there is a universe of incredible material this guy has released over the past 30+ years that is largely overlooked.After some real hit and miss releases in the '90s, Van started to click again with his 1999 release ""Back On Top"". His 2003 release ""What's Wrong With This Picture?"" was perhaps one of his best in over a decade, but in retrospect was just laying the groundwork for this record.Magic Time puts the rest of the pieces from ""What's Wrong"" together. Van sounds more comfortable on this album and his voice is as commanding as it has ever been. With this release, the rubber has finally hit the road. Let's hope the ride is just beginning again."
4,Cranky is as Cranky does!,"Van has always had one of the best R&B and Soulful voices around,all the more unique since he is Irish!Celtic New Year is worth the price alone,but his takes on Sinatra and Como make Rod Stewart sound like a hack. My only complaint is that I really do not think Van has had such a hard time with the music business.He is certainly rewarded well and I think he just wants people to say "" poor Mr. Morrison,the record companies sure treat him badly!! Greg"
2,Waiting For The Man,"I keep hoping very hard that the real Van Morrison will someday stand up again. I have been hoping for this for about the last 6 or 7 Van albums. As for Magic Time....well, where is the magic? I don't hear it or feel it coming from this recording either. I won't give up waiting though and even if Van never delivers the shivers again, I still have a vast treasure of older masterpeices to plug into. So for now, I will just keep my ears on the horizon searching and hoping for a possible full force gale."
1,Couldn't keep mediocrity at bay,"I'm one of those die hard Van fans and own 25+ of his cd's. I saw the good reviews on this one and bought it and was very disappointed. See the review by Michael A. Padilla to get the gist of my complaints. I just wanted to add another negative review to hopefully save other fans from making the mistake I did. Van is still one of the greatest and I expect more great music from him but except for Celtic New Year this cd wasn't it. My all time favorite Van cd is ""A Night in San Francisco"" which is a phenomenal live album.I'm changing my review after listening to the album for a while (actually there's only a few songs I listen to on it). I think this cd is one of those enigmas that Van comes out with: Celtic New Year is one his most listenable songs ever and Stranded, Gypsy in My Soul and Just Like Greta are enjoyable but some of the others are just horrible. Amazon let's you edit your review but it doesn't let you change the # of stars otherwise I'd make this a 3."
3,Nice Enough,"Van is soulful, tuneful, in tune, and always easy on the ears. He's been a lot more than that, though, and if you haven't heard his two really, really 5-star albums, Astral Weeks and Veedon Fleece, or his many 4-star albums (Moondance, Tupelo Honey, Into the Music, Hard Nose the Highway among them), then by all means start there instead."
3,Not such a magic time but enjoyable!,"There have been quite a diverse range of reviews for ""Magic Time"" they can be divided up easily between amazon reviews vs. the music media. I feel that the music media wins hands down!I have been a huge fan for a long time but as with many patient fans we are constantly waiting for the magic of the 70's & 80's to come back.The problem here is that this is an artist that has exceedingly high standards with his music that his fans are on the same level.I have listen to this CD many times and the highlight is without doubt ""Celtic New Year"" which is truly beautiful and stands up there with some of his best tunes. Further highights include Just like Greta, Lion This Time and the the title track Magic Time. On the down side there is some lazy stuff which is why I gave it the 3 star rating.Van will continue to put out quality albums I am sure but I suppose that we all have to adjust our level of expectation to a more realistic one."
5,"An eclectic mix of soul, jazz and blues","Van Morrison never fails to put across an intimate feel with his music. It seems to place you in a smoke filled juke joint somewhere in middle america, or in an upscale jazz club in some big city the moment you listen to it. His distinctive vocals always deliver the heart of the piece he is performing. This collection is exceptionally good, not one track you will likely skip during playtime. Well done..."
5,Brimming,"This cat tosses off rockin' soulful jazz like everyone else makes a cuppa' coffeeBrilliant fun, deep feeling."
5,On First Listening,"I'm blown away. Nobody can phrase a song like Van Morrison; and nobody has that voice, steeped in pain, cigarettes, and whiskey. I thought ""What's Wrong With This Picture?"" was mesmerizing. Here, Van has better material, better backup, and better production. A joy and a gem in the overwhelming, derivative slop of most popular music."
1,Van Morrison Has A Great Musical History!,"This man has really made many classic albums!Listen to Astral Weeks, Moondance and Irish Heartbeat which are must-buy for all Van Morrison fans.This man is a very skillful player, compositor and performer!Unfornately, Magic Time is the worst record this man has ever cut. Maybe he his losing his creativity and he should soon stop his awesome musical career. Every artist has their own house of holy and Van Morrison has made his own!"
3,Only cause its Van.....,"I purchased this, as a friend was listening to it. He didn't say it was good (lol, thanks Tom) but I took his listening as a thumbs up. Not so.I'd say skip this one..."
4,Great Action Scenes,"Gregory Peck is solid as usual as a British Naval captain who mixes it up with the Spanish and French, wins the love of a beautiful lady, and earns the respect of his crew through both his leadership at sea and his strength of character. Virginia Mayo is the beautiful lady he falls in love with. The action sequences as ships battle it out are exciting and very well filmed, which is to be expected in a film directed by Raoul Walsh. The sight of the great boats attacking and manoeuvering around is a highlight of the film. The rest of the film moves along well, although for me, it's the fighting and action that make this picture memorable."
5,Widescreen??,"This wonderful movie was produced in 1951, before the advent of ""Widescreen"".Its' original aspect ratio was 1/37/1 or slightly wider than ""full screen"" (1/33/1). This DVD preserves the original aspect ratio of the film.Source: IMDB"
5,Bully for CHH,"A super semi-historical movie about the British navy,it's customs and it's personnel.Great cast-well performed and technologically excellent.Boy lose girl-boy get girl plot for romance.Action--galore.."
4,A Good Sea Tale,"A good adaptation of a Forester novel. Not surprising considering he wrote the screenplay. Peck & Mayo's non-British perfomance is a little jarring, but if you can get past it (not hard for a yank like me), the movie works very well."
3,Its ok..,"I had to watch it for a college paper. Its an ok movie, the battle between the Natividad and Lydia is very good, pretty accurate depection of weapons and tactics. The first half of the movie is quiet enjoyable. Once hornblower returns to England and gets a new ship, things get kind hokey. Let's just say satan himself would envy this guys luck. Still, the acting is good, the plot is good in a historical context of the napeolinic wars, and the first ship battle is worth watching. The love story seems tacked on, but hey, you gotta have a love story i supose."
2,Kids only,"Amazing how Walsh, after having filmed such great classics, could have fallen so low. This is a film for young TV audiences. If you have absolutely nothing to do on any given afternoon you may find it tolerable too. Predictible dialogues, exaggerated stereotypes... Plays better with the sound off."
5,Fantastic Movie,"This is a great movie. I cannot tell you if it is 100% faithful to the book because I've only read synopsis on the book and scene the other Horatio Horblower movies, but it appears to be along similar lines as what I've seen from those. From a ""family movie"" perspective, this is pretty decent (actually cleaner than what the book appears to be)."
5,Gregery Peck at his best!,Wonderful story with lots of intelegent action. Great script well acted by Peck and Mayo. A truely great navel story.
5,Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail.,24 Oct 09 Saturday: This is one of Gregory Pecks best films!!!!!! He always gives a great historial performance!!!!!!!!! Naval warfare in the age of sail was a bloody business!!!! I want to thank Amazon.dvd for excellent customer service. Best/Wishes Charles in So. California...
4,"Hornblower, the movie","Great action classic, from an amazing novel. Some naval scenes are clearly made with painted sets, but very well done for the time. Wonderful the British TV series (prequel)."
4,Realistic Battle scenes,"A bit sappy plot so as to highlight Virginia Mayo, but I found the battle scenes very realistic. Peck is quite believeable in his role. Overall good escape movie."
5,They don't make movies like this anymore,"My favorite Genre is high seas adventures, pirate movies and naval warfare movies. If you like tall ships, cannon broadsides and these type of films this one will satisfy you. The film seems fairly historically accurate with a few flaws...but it's a movie not a history book. Gregory Peck is great. The costumes and ships are great. I especially liked how the Captain's uniform at times is worn and tattered...nice effect. I judge all these movies not on sword fighting, but ship to ship fighting. This movie, Damn the Defiant, The Sea Hawk and Master and Commander are the best in this regard. I just ordered the Horatio Hornblower 8 DVD A & E / BBC series. Please email me if I am missing another flick that fits this bill."
5,Captain Horatio Hornblower,"The quality of this film was awesome considering it's an old movie digitized. My husband loves this classic. VERY classic though, old fashioned for sure if it's your style you'll love it."
3,Nothing like the book,"This movie was absolutely nothing like the book its based on. If you want some REAL action, read the book. Freestanding, it isn't bad (so long as you ignore the idiotic romance tale). But if you're looking for Hornblower, you won't find him."
4,Swashbuckling Technicolor fun,"A fun, uncomplicated pirate film starring Gregory Peck as the restrained, capable Captain Horatio Hornblower, hero of the popular novels by C. S. Forester. Starts on an action-packed note, then slows down a bit for a long romantic interlude, then picks up steam again as cannons burst and swords clash in the big climactic battles of the end. Good old-fashioned fun, with a brisk script and plenty of great character actors and snazzy Technicolor cinematography. Recommended!"
4,The artists are...,1. Motorhead2. Flotsam and Jetsam3. Prong4. Death Angel5. Joe Lynn Turner6. Clutch7. Testament8. Ugly Kid Joe9. Life After Death10. Dark Angel
4,"""Murder in yer Bed...""","Worth the cost of admission for Lemmy & Co's version of 'Whiplash' complete w/ slightly customized lyrics.The reason I didn't give this the full 5 stars is because most of these guys aren't covering the songs, they're just playing them as Metallica does. What I want from a cover is a reinterpretation. Like mediocre band Faster Pussycat's version of 'You're So Vain' (seriously, go watch it on Youtube) or like Metallica's cover of B.O.C's 'Astronomy' putting your own twist on a tune is what covering it is supposed to be about. Have you honestly ever heard Dylan's version of ""All Along the Watchtower""? Probably not, and you shouldn't, because that'd be one more time you could've listened to the Hendrix version instead.\m/_ Lemmy! _\m/"
5,A Must Have!,"I love Metallica, so I'm biased as to say, even if they're all renditions of some of their greatest songs, this is a great collection! If you're a Metallica fan, I bet you caught yourself thinking any given time: ""If they had done this or that in this particular song, it would have sounded even cooler!"" Here it is! From Motörhead's neck-breaking 'Whiplash' through Dark Angel's awesome 'Creeping Death', you'll find yourself headbanging the entire audition! Highlights: Flotsam & Jetsam's 'Damage, Inc.' & Death Angel's 'Trapped Under Ice'. They almost beat the hell outta Metallica themselves! A Must-Have to all true Four Horsemen aficionado!"
5,Turn it on (and turn it up)!,"Pure Dwight, perhaps just a notch below ""This Time"", but still great. ""Heart That You Own"" is perhaps (IMHO) the greatest country song ever recorded by a ""modern"" artist - this cut alone is worth owning the CD for, at least you'll never wear the song out as I surely would have by now if this was an album.""Turn It On..."" is another classic, and one that you will want to ""turn up"". I'm not one for playing music at high volumes but it's hard to resist not bumping this song up a couple of notches. Of course, all the songwriting/lyrics are superb...just par for the course for Mr. Yoakam.Too many other strong cuts to mention. A must have for any country collection, particularly in the honky-tonk style."
5,Great Box Set,This set won't disappoint any Frank lover.The songs chosen are great.The third disc alone makes it worth the price.Fantastic!
5,Very good collection for a good price,"This is a great value if you are looking for the many highlights of Frank in the Reprise years. This will give you many (not all) of his great recordings. This will save you much time and money vs. trying to find many of these songs individually.In short: gives you alot of songs for the money. However, there is much more out there during the Reprise years to discover."
4,A GOOD CROSS SECTION,"If u want a rich sampler, go and get this one. If u want a small sampler go for the VERY GOOD YEARS. For hardcore fans, get the COMPLETE REPRISE box.I purchased this in 1990 and have enjoyed it. However, had I known that REPRISE was subsequently going to release so many albums (the way they came out) on individual CDs, I would have passed this one up. I simply prefer to purchase Sinatra the way he intented it: THEME ALBUMS."
4,Classic,If you like the original you will love the second Bubble Bobble too. My kid enjoyed it as well. Good game.
3,Bubble Bobble,"If it wasn't for douche bags stealing my NES copy, i wouldn't need this one!!!! But good game, even better on NES, loses some quality on gameboy"
4,My kid loves this!,My daughter spends hours playing this game and says it is her favorite Wii activity!
3,Fun with a bit of disapointment,"The Sims are always fun and this was a cute twist to their lives, but I was disapointed that you can't have more than one game saved and that they can't have babies."
2,What am I suppose to do?,Maybe I just don't know how to play but all I did with this game is wondering around on the beach eating coconuts and then I died.
4,Pretty good!,"This game was really fun and interesting. There are a lot of different plants to discover, new goals at each island. It keeps you busy! Only thing was, even though there were a lot of things to go through before you beat the game, I beat in in about three days. I wish they had made each task a little harder. Still a really fun game though! I recommend it! :)"
3,Good and bad,"I like this game, but it is really only good for one person to play at a time. You have to make your way through the challenges and remember where you found items. There is not an option for another player to have a game going to save their own progress. It is fun, but would prefer to have multiple profiles to play with."
2,Don't be fooled,I bought Sims 2 Castaway with my X-mas $ in January. I was so excited after reading all of these great reviews. After about a week I was bored of it and just started playing the old games again. Sims 2 Castaway is a good game until you acctually start playing it a lot. You have to keep all of your Sim's stats up AND make friends. This game makes it seem like YOU are stranded on the deserted island. You get so bored. You can only play pn it for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time or you'll see what I mean.
3,Ok game,"I love the Sims games. This game was fun until I beat it and got off the island. Then I just lost interest in it. It is a really cool game, maybe my attention span is just too short."
5,Great Game!,"This is a great, interactive game. I LOVE IT! Any Sims lover will definitely have this in their collection!!!"
3,Failure analysis Case Studies III,The case studies are reprints from the Elsevier journal Engineering Failure Analysis published 2000-2002. Most are interesting enough though I wouldn't have chosen all of them myself. I'm not into finite element analysis so the firewall breakup of the Piper Alpha didn't do much for me. I was disappointed with the reproduction quality of the photographic images. Most have lost contrast and detail is lost. For me this is a very annoying feature and is the reason why I didn't rate the volume higher. My opinion of Elsevier is diminished.
4,Freddie King Rocks!,"I am a huge Freddie King fan, therefore I loved this DVD. It's funny with all the go-go girls and the sixties look, but Freddie still rocks it! I wouldn't recommend this for someone new to Freddie King, but if you're a fan then you should have this in your library."
1,Lining Fell Apart,"At first, I loved my Bike Cube. In fact, I bought the red one as a gift. But, my delight was short lived. The bag lining deteriorated into little bits and pieces getting into all of my gear.The bag became unusable. The same thing happened to the larger red one."
4,Spell binder!,"Ken Currie is a master at plot and character development. Half-way through, I couldn't put it down! A year and a half ago, most people would not have believed the story. Today, it takes on an eerie sense of reality as the writer puts you behind the scenes in Washington DC while the military and other agencies try to piece together clues about an attack on a U.S. military cargo ship. What they uncover has much broader and immediate implications for the civilian community at large. I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to gain a better understanding of today's real-world challenge of ""connecting the dots"" to prevent terrorist actions."
5,This is one of my favorite Christmas albums.,"""Merry Christmas from Joni"" is a traditional Christmas album, with beautiful orchestrations and a choir accompanying Ms. James' sweet and sincere vocals. The highlights are ""I'll Be Home for Christmas,"" ""White Christmas,"" ""The First Noel,"" ""Nina-Non,"" ""Christmas and You,"" and a rendition of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" that ranks with Judy Garland's version. These selections are my favorites on this album, but I like them all. ""Merry Christmas from Joni"" is a must for year-end holiday listening. ""Give Us This Day"" is an inspirational album that is good for listening throughout the year, and has a similar orchestral style to the Christmas album. I am especially fond of the songs ""Give Us This Day,"" ""Bless This House,"" ""I Believe,"" ""Count Your Blessings,"" and ""Ave Maria."""
2,Disappointing,"I've read Unofficial Guides series before (e.g. Disney) and loved them...so I was disappointed when I got this one and it was not good at all. It is poorly organized for one thing. Instead of separating the sections by island, it has everything together. For example, if you want to find a good restaurant in Kauai, you have to look at the entire restaurant section and try to find ones that are in Kauai. The other books I'v read have a Kauai section and then you just turn to the restaurant portion of that section. Unless you are going to visit all the islands of Hawaii on your trip, then you are going to waste a lot of time reading stuff that doesn't apply to your trip. I was also disappointed in the level of detail provided."
1,Do not order from this company,"I ordered item through Old Glory. Called 8/6/07 to let them know I never received it, they assured me it would be at my house the next day. I waited 2 extra days before I called them again. Was told it was shipped out on 7/26/2007, they offered me a refund or if I wanted to buy something else. I do not believe it was ever sent out. They lie and mislead the customers. If it was ever sent they would have informed me to return. DO NOT BUY THROUGH THIS COMPANY."
5,Truly Beautiful Harmony,Superb recording of a truly talented group. If this doesn't get you in the mood for Christmas then you must be a card carrying Scrooge!! The Dale Warland Singers were a multi-talented group and the quality of the recording is excellent. The same is also true of the volume 0ne of their Christmas music. I haven't heard a group of this caliber since Musica Sacra. I am only sorry that they disbanded a few years ago.
5,Heavenly City,"Beautiful book, delivered in a very timely fashion in the condition it was promised and.....the book came from someone in my own home town, Wilmette. Pretty amazing! Mary"
1,I'm embarassed for Honeywell,"This clock is difficult to setup and operate. In an age where we have iPods, iPhones and Wiis, I can't believe Honeywell would manufacture and sell something that is so non-intuitive, clunky and stupid. The other folks who criticized this item are correct - it tells the time and everything else is hard to use, non-adjustable and clunky. Honeywell - why don't you hire some interface designers to make something suitable for this decade instead of the 1970s?"
2,Threw it out after months of trying to work with it,"The temperature sensor never worked right. The alarm eventually stopped working. Too easy to hit ""touch sensitive"" buttons and change major settings (like the alarm). Nice looking, but too much of the functionality just fails. I threw it in the trash. I tried for months to like it."
1,Ripoff,Projection failed after one year. Have had Oregon Scientific which I paid $20. for for 5 years. No problem.
2,LCD broke after 9 months: garbled projection,"I bought the identical looking Model PCR11ELW without the weather feature.I got it to work and was satisfied.After 8 or 9 months several sections of the LCD gave up resulting in a garbled useless display. Bad quality - and I did not register the deviceand did not kep the box with the UPC - out of luck with 1 year warranty.I trusted the Honeywell name - probably a mistake.I have had one other projection clock for 5 years - another brand and cheaper, that still works fine (I bought it in Europe)."
2,Will not project,It fell off the dresser one time onto the carpet floor and now will not project. I would say it is poor quality to fall only 2 feet onto plush carpet and break!!! Call customer care and they did not help at all.....I am screwed!!!I love the style the the dark red for night vision but afraid to buy another one if they are make cheap!
4,Excellent product,The clock works very well once you get it set up and synchronized with the atomic clock. Display is very accurate and easy to read even in total darkness. The only improvement they need on this product is to make the set up instructions more clear and easier to follow.
2,CCould not get the projection to work,Seems like a great product but could never get the projection feature to work properly. Finally gave up and use it as a clock in our TV room.
3,lots o' fun,Laugh at all the rednecks you know and love with this dead-on parody of Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol. Helton and Yow's jokes and gags are perfectly illustrated by David Boyd.
2,A Fire That Resists Extinguishing,"I really, really liked the cover. As for the words inside, talk about complex and yes, improbable, it was difficult to take seriously. Being from Chicago I liked references to the city. And the cover, again, was Wow, very nice!"
2,Complete Idiots Guide to Skiing,A very elementary introduction to skiing. Only good for the very beginners.
1,Worst I have experienced of this type,Total waste of money. The sponge and all caps leak soap. 3m should be embarrassed to put this product on the market.
5,Dishwand,I purchased a 3M #550-12 Scotch Brite Dishwand. I am totally satisfied with the product and was very glad I could still get this product. I had searched in several retail stores and could not find the product. I do hope it will be sold on line for some time to come. It really works well on pans and stuck on food on plates.
1,Stay away,"The useless button leaks and falls off. This thing wastes soap, is messy, and very annoying. The scrub pad things would be OK if not for the leaking button thing."
1,soap leaks out,I bought one of these and the soap leaked out of the push button within a day or two. Bought another and the same thing happened. Serious design flaws in this model. Do not waste your time and money.
4,Not in France,"Bonjour,Remarquable outil pour la vaisselle en mode solo.Malheureusement pas disponible en France.Un effort Monsieur 3M"
1,LEAKS Constantly,"From the moment I got it, this item has leaked large amounts of dish soap, sometimes up to half its contents all over my sink. I have tried storing it in every possible position and this still occurs. This is the second one I've tried with this problem. I've thrown it away and will never buy another. Awful mess."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS TERRIBLE,"My husband brought one of these home and said that he liked it better since it had a scrub brush and not just a sponge. The first one we had within the top knob designed for controlling the amount of soap you use came off. I had to dig it out of my garbage disposal.....enough said. I was convince that it had to be a defect in that dishwand, WRONG, I bought another one and within one day it fell off. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT IS TERRIBLE!!! I hope this review saves someone the aggrevation."
2,Scotch Brite Dishwand not worth it,"I used one for almost a year with no problems, but when I moved and bought a new one, the stupid blue button got pushed in immediately and I couldn't get it out, so I bought another one. First time using it I noticed a slit right in the blue button that opened when I pushed on it.They always leaked, but I dealt with it. The blue botton is the worst idea yet. I give up on it."
1,Poor Design and Poorly Made,"I bought one of these from a store (not Amazon) and like others have reported, the button pump leaked from the beginning and wastes soap. It's more of a marketing gimmick than a good idea. When you use the pump too much soap goes into the sponge and wastes more soap; enough soap goes into the sponge without using the pump. Soap also leaks from the cap. Shortly after realizing these leak issues, I would only fill the wand with enough soap to cover the valve above the sponge, way below the cap and pump button, and stand it up on the sponge with the handle pointing up. This worked well, but less than a year later the handle cracked open at the cap and water leaked in when washing dishes. I had a cheaper wand made by a company not as big as 3M that worked for years before it cracked. 3M usually makes excellent products. It's hard to believe they'd release a product like this one."
1,The blue pump button sucks,"This new design is terrible. We've bought 3 of them and they all leak like crazy and the blue pump button is a stupid design. The button doesn't fit very tightly into the wand so air gets in, thus causing a lot of soap to just leak out. On several occasions I've had the blue button get pushed into the wand and I've had to dig it out. All three wands have these problems. Go back to the old design WITHOUT THE BLUE BUTTON. We had 2 of those that lasted for years before they finally died. The old design was much better."
1,Everything went wrong,"I was trying to replace a no-name wand I had for 8 years. I thought Scotch-Brite was a good name and they had the green scrubber on the sponge. Within 2 weeks, the ""button"" that lets you squirt more soap on started falling out. Plus, the screw cap leaked dishwasher soap in my holder, so there was always soap running down the handle. The button finally gave up the ghost, wouldn't stay in the hole, so the wand would no longer even poorly hold soap. Threw it in the garbage and took back the extra sponges. Pitiful."
1,Product has changed,"I used to love the dishwand by scotch brite but what is pictured and what you may have gotten in the past is not what you will get now. The overall shape of the product has changed...now it's shorter and stubbier and holds less detergent. The plastic cap and button is now white. Most importantly, the button seems to be made of a harder and less flexible plastic. I'm not confident that it has the same quality of construction that the dishwant that I had grown to love had."
1,Waste of money it sucks,"Just to reiterate the other reviews, the button leaks and won't stay in. Worthless. I found a buttonless one, much better."
4,una buena seleccion de musica nordestina brasilera,"este ritmo tipico del norte de brasil es absolutamente diferente de lo que usualmente conocemos como ""musica de brasil "" (samba,bossa nova,etc). Su cadencia ritmica es distinta y la base instrumental tambien lo es. Hecha esta salvedad, es un ritmo con mucho encanto y muy alegre en sus melodias. La seleccion presentada aqui, como toda seleccion, tiene sus ausencias, y algunas presencias no tan merecidas o correctas, pero es una muy buena forma de conocer una ""nueva"" forma de musica del brasil, diferente, pero tan rica como las otras expresiones musicales de ese pais"
4,An excellent way to get started in this music,"David Byrne's Luaka-bob series on Brazilian music are some of the very best world-music compilations around. Volume 1 (""Beleza Tropical"") is definitely the place to get started -- it's so enchanting you will have to keep going. By the time you get to this one, Vol. 3, hopefully you'll be hooked. This is Brazilian music with a ""country"" feel, a bit more rural and rough and thus a very spicy addition to the series. Buy this if you liked the others in the series."
5,beautiful album,"I love this album. All of the songs are interesting, and the CD flows well from one song to the next. I like the Trader Horne song and was obsessed with ""Graveyard"" for a long while. Now I tend to listen to the album as a whole, rather than one or two songs at a time."
5,Perfect case for me,"I chose this case over a similar one that used different colors for each day. This case received much better reviews. While it may be a little difficult to open the compartments, these shouldn't open that easily anyway. The compartments do fit all of my pills. I've fit about 3 large pills in each compartment to test it out. I'm very happy i chose this. I sits up very nicely on my desk and is easy to travel with."
2,Save Your Money,"After Strausbaugh very early makes the obvious point that the Stones USED to be good but NOW are bad the book is a rehashing of this tired truism.You almost feel bad for the guy writing about has-beens at this point in his life instead of discovering new music. Also, anyone who uses the band ""Furious George"" as a cultural signifier is a joke. Their lead singer writes for the same weekly Strausbaugh works for and once wrote a VERY ugly piece on why women should not be rock musicians.Use your money to buy the new ""White Stripes"" or ""Oneida"""
4,Like being there!,I really enjoyed the DVD. It looked very hot in Cain's Ballroom but everyone looked to enjoy the event. I hope Cody & the Boys from Oklahoma record another live DVD soon.
2,"These are only for FLAT, Smooth surfaces!","Be sure you have a very flat, smooth surface for these bumper cars. There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car. Our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway. We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface. These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court."
4,a longlasting gift from the heart,"FROM YOUR VALENTINE: Valentines from the Past is a labor of love & a treasure trove of the history of cultural art - little farmer boys, little misses, children dressing up, courting couples. We can see the changing styles in clothing, toys & furniture - from the middle of the 1800s clear up to the 1950s.If you have ever wondered how Valentine's Day evolved & if you're looking for an enduring gift with no calories to offer the ones you love, then FROM YOUR VALENTINE will fit the bill!"
1,No what I was expecting,"In my opinion the author is not familiar with the subject, the book is more like a general thermodynamics' overview of the chilled water process without touching the mechanical part of it, if you are looking for an in-depth technical explanation about different chillers types keep on looking, this is not your book."
4,Good entry level book for chillers and cooling towers,"I liked Marcell's book quite a bit. He is good at explaining many of the facets of chiller operation, selection and application along with cooling tower applications. I wish he would use more formulas in a future edition of the book. Overall it was a good entry level book and I would recommend it to entry level through 2 year controls and mechanical engineers needing to know more about chilled water generation."
5,Great Book for HVAC Information,I bought this as a Christmas present for my son who is a HVAC Technician. He was very happy and surprised when I gave him the book for Christmas. If you are into HVAC this would be an excellent book to have.
1,More kiddie krap.,"This game has issues. The graphics are way dark and we are left with can't-see-sh!t camera angles, and a game that is absolute he11 to play. Since this ""game"" is intended for kids, I tried to clean up the profanity, but this game is one of the worst I have ever played."
2,6GB Pocket Drive,Repeatedly gives CRC (cyclical redundancy check) error when moving several files to drive.
5,Wish they still had these!,"I got this item a long time ago and love it. The size is perfect (about as big around as, but a bit thinner than a hockey puck), color is great, charity is absolutely worthy and it is so easy to quickly put away when you are done. Everybody asks me where I got it and I know they could sell a lot more if they got them in stock. Of course maybe make the new ones with more memory."
4,Excellent..!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Very I am satisfied with the product, is small, versatile, comfortable, I recommend it..."
5,nom nom nom,"Zotz are delicious! I can't find them anywhere close by so instead of paying double at the gas station or having to go a party store, I figured I'd just get out fix on Amazon. Great deal - good price, lot of zotz. Should last us a while. If you like sour and/or fizz, this is the candy for you. However, I don't think they're sour."
1,This is an ILLEGAL BOOTLEG,"Some Russian company is putting this album out and is not affiliated with Virgin or Enigma.The tracks here can all be found here on Amazon. Most of the tracks are by Mythos (album ""Mythos""). Flatlands is by Delerium (""Semantic Spaces""), and Cang Ding is by Celestial (""Spirit House""). The only track I couldn't identify is Close to Heaven. It sounds like Enigma's work (but don't hold me to that).The track ordering I have is different from the one here, and several others I've seen on the Internet, though the track titles are consistant and match the original artist's.The music in this collection is fantastic work (4 stars), but please, support the original artists -- Mythos, Delerium, Celestial, Enigma. I also reccomend Deep Forest and Adiemus. D-Emotion does not exist except in illegal bootleg form."
5,Best Pan I Own!,"I love this pan! It is the best pan I've ever owned. My other pans are stainless steel but can't hold a candle to this one. It makes the best omelets and is the best nonstick pan. Just make sure your pan is well heated before cooking and follow the care instructions. You will have no problem. Before I bought this pan I really didn't know anything about them. I didn't know a seasoned pan from an unseasoned pan. There is no need to season this pan as I have read many people do. It works great just as it is right out the box. For those of you who are contemplating buying this pan, just buy it and I guarantee you'll love it!"
3,I like cast iron but this still needs upkeep,"Yes cast iron can be great, blah blah. It still requires upkeep and i sort of hate it. I use my stainless steel way more than cast iron. I just hate cleaning it."
2,I've had no luck on non-stick,"I seasoned it per instructions, fried bacon and other fatty foods, found meat, eggs stuck. Re-seasoned per other instructions, fried only fatty foods, etc. Never used soap, oiled a bit after use. After a month,I'm resigned to spraying with PAM for anything that isn't fatty. The only things I find it better at than my non-stick pans is searing meat."
1,"Too small, not declared size","While outer size is, indeed, 10 inches, the frying surface itself is barely 8 inches. Uses too much space for its actual size. Had to send it back."
5,"Pro Logic 10"" CI skillet","I just got this skillet today & used it right away. I have arthritis in my hands & had no problem with it's weight bcs the handle fits comfortably & balances the pan. I did use the assist handle. I set the hot pan on a trivet on my counter ... Little suspecting how cast iron holds heat. It melted the trivet into a puddle stuck to the bottom of the pan. Words fail me. But cast iron is virtually indestructible and after it cooled enough to touch, that cheap old trivet peeled right off. the pan's good as new- well, it IS new. the adventure continues."
4,Great Skillet to take camping,What a great skillet to take camping. Took this up into the Smoky Mountains National Park and it was by far the best piece of cooking equipment we packed. It's a little heavy but worth it !
5,"Ettore 14100 Shower Sweep, Bath Squeege",This makes a clean sweep of residual water from shower tile and glass. The separate suction hook does not hold so the squeege must stand upright. An excellent product and a good size. This was a replacement for the same brand squeege purchased about 10 years ago.
5,Being a part of real life struggles,"Marx once wrote to a friend that he did not feel his contribution was the discovery of the material underpinnings of politics nor the existence of class conflict but rather identifying the central role that the working class was to play in the struggle toward socialism. Luxemburg felt that the role of a party was to support the spontaneous movement of the working class toward that goal. For her spontaneous did not mean impulsive as in unplanned but rather organic, beyond the capacity of a party to predict, but which a party must engage, educate, and support. A quick and good read."
4,CL220,"Excellent price and delivery. I bought this for the 2013 pool season and it's replacing a chlorine-worn CL220 that I got about five years out of. This product keeps my pool chlorinated all season as long as I remember to add chlorine pucks every two weeks or so.I will say that the controls become gummed up with chlorine residue over time and the gasket for the top needs to be changed every four months. However, if you clean it regularly and change gaskets, this is a worry-free addition to any pool system. Our water is always very clear."
4,Hayward 220,"Good product, but dont expect more than 3-4yrs of use. Direct sunlight, hot temps, and chemicals eventually warp the lid. This will cause it not to seal and feed chlorine. If your lid becomes hard to open and close don't bother replacing the ring buy new and keep a float as a back up!"
1,Scam. Not a Hayward 220 chlorinator.,"Scam. This is not a Hayward model 220 chlorinator. I received an extremely poorly packed model off-brand chlorinator purportedly branded ""VB"", model ""70168A"", ""originating"" in the Chinese port of Ningbo [...]Scam."
3,MISSING PARTS,This is exactly the item I requested to replace the salt system for my pool. Everything with the exception of the tubing was included. The tubing was an addtional expense of $10 and a week's delay for installation of chlorinator.
4,My Second One.,I had one for a few years which worked okay until the lid got hard to remove and put back on. I just hope that this one will work better and longer.
3,Disappointing,"I'm a fan of both Evan Hunter and his alter ego, Ed McBain, and I must say 'The Chisholms' didn't read as though it was written by either. It was more like a pilot for a TV show which didn't get aired. The characters and the premise - a family forced to cross dangerous territory - were not well developed, and when I reached the end I found myself looking for a note explaining that I ought to have bought the second in the series! The blurb talks up the story, and I had been looking forward to a different genre from a favourite author, but overall this was one big disappointment."
3,"Expensive, but....","Whether this is worth the money depends upon how you'd view this information: This book contains rare photos of a cloistered nun in the early era of photography who became a saint (then died at age 24). So of course there are only a handful of photos, several with other nuns in which her face is very small and blurry. The couple of good existing close-up photos are reproduced throughout the pages in various ways (cropped, enlarged, etc.) to make a large enough book to warrant its price. Still, she is Therese of Lisieux!"
5,Wonderful views of a wonderful person,"We should be thankful that Therese's sister Celine, who was with her in the Carmelite convent, was a photographer. It was Celine's interest and ability that provides the images. It is quite obvious that Celine knew that her little sister was someone very special, and very worth 'publicizing'."
4,One Arm Hero,"In this third and final film of the exciting Martial Arts Trilogy, Sam The iron Bridge is now Governor of Canto. When the raiding pirates threaten to take over the Southern border, Sam and his trusted fighters must confront the enemies in a fierce battle to the death. One Arm Hero is a powerful and satisfying conclusion to the epic saga."
4,Wonderful,This was done in the 1980s and was great then and I love it now! For anyone who loves harmony.
4,Good bushings,"I replaced the bushing in my 70 Chevelle and these fit right in and made a very noticable difference in my car's ride and handling.The main down side is none of the metal hardware is included with the A-body kit and you have to re-use your old shells, or go hunt down news stuff.I was able to media blast, phosphate and then paint most of my old bushings, and then fabricated new ones out of some conduit and washers to replace the two that were heavily corroded. I then bought all new bolts.The second downside is the way energy suspension just bags every kind of bushing possible in the kit so it will fit either the small shell, or big shell bushing cars so you end up with a bunch of stuff you don't need and are paying for.If I had to do it again I'd bought the poly kit that OPG offers that has all new hardware included, and I highly suggest that path for anyone who doesn't have the tools, or inclination, to save the old bushing shells."
4,Remnants of a legend,"Forget about Photon the book, or the books. Where is Photon the TV show? Where is the deluxe 18-disc leatherbound autographed special edition DVD set of this legendary show that only the few and the cool can recall?Where is the jaw-dropping, I-can't-believe-I-just-watched-that TV show, where the bad guys used to do impressive back flips after being shot with the Photon gun? How did an 80s light-gun game with that chunky helmet birth a TV show and spin-off tie-in books, no less? Why has Bhodi Li not reappeared in one of the newer Star Wars movies?Why hasn't the soundtrack appeared on a 2-CD set? With that action-scene music and the background vocals going 'Photon...photon...photonphoton' [dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun]I remain confident that Photon will see the light of day on DVD, and should, in fact, be put in a space capsule and launched out of the earth so that our legacy as humans can be known to all."
5,Intelligent writing for intelligent readers,"I agree with two other reviewers' comments, but I like to add just one more: I thought Ms. Walker has done a tremendous job on the characterization developments. She has divided story fair equally among the three heroines: their feelings, realizations, and growth developments. There were no real villains, but imperfections and misunderstanding of one another's intentions. The book was kind of long for Regency Romance paperbacks, but it was such a well-written story that I felt any less pages might jeopardize the success of the book.The only complaint is: who was the lady that was portrayed on the book cover? None of the three heroines was brunette, not for the sub-characters either. In fact, the main character among the three heroines was a striking blond, apparently neither artist nor editor has noticed. So far-off."
4,A very good Numerical Analysis book but with small mistakes.,"I have been using this book since the first edition in 1970. I have just bought the last edition, from Amazon, and found three errors in the first chapter. It should be corrected. In figure 1.2 (pag 4), the end of l1 is not right.In the same page the third formula is not right, as it should show sqr(sin) instead of sin. In page 41, the first digit (d1) would always be 1, so IEEE 754 changed a little what is presented.Even so I want to repit that this is very good book and I recommend it firmly.Raymundo de Oliveira"
2,Numerous errors in text,"Have to agree with earlier post, book looks nice and clear but numerous errors make actually using (vs. just browsing) the material very difficult. 7th edition ADI section has numerous mislabed equations, incorrect data values, unfortunate. Suggest look elsewhere for a numerical analysis book."
5,Ali at her best.,"To be quite honest, I got this because Ali is in it, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise, with a great story line and it was well acted and well written. I won't give anything away because if you like Ali MacGraw, then you need to see this."
3,Meh...,"Does what it is supposed to do for about three days, after which it is necessary to restart the computer it is attached to in order to use the drive. Not surprising considering the price. The inclusion of a power supply is quite nice though... TANSTAAFL"
4,It's great!,"My 2 month old daughter loves this swing!!! I am so glad we chose this one because of the 2 swinging options. She defintely prefers the side to side swinging.The only negative thing I can say about it is that the music/sounds and mobile stop working first when the batteries get low, but the swinging is still going strong. So you either have to use the swing with no music or mobile until the batteries run out, or throw away the batteries that are not quite dead yet. I think the music/mobile should have a second compartment for batteries."
3,Ok...but some drawbacks,"I really love the aquarium series! So when I got a different swing for my baby shower, I ran right back down to Babies R Us and got my aquarium swing!Unfortunately, I have some negative points:1) The first setting on the swing is SO FAST that we cannot use it for my newborn. It looks like it will launch him across the room. This is particularly a pain in the butt because you have to walk over and push them every min or so to keep them soothed.2) The music and lights will only play for about 5 mins. So you have to run over there every 5 mins and restart the music. That's the most annoying thing.Other than that..it looks great?"
2,Just OKAY,The Lower speed is malfunctioned. The next speed for the swing is entirely too fast for a week old infant.
4,The old design was so much cuter!,"I have the older model for my 8 month old and it was a lifesaver when he was a newborn. After he was done nursing this swing always got him back to sleep and entertained him while we ate dinner, its a must have for every new parent."
5,THE BEST! LOVE IT!,This was the BEST swing ever! My son slept in it his first few months. He had reflux and the cradle of the swing was perfect for him to sleep comfortably in. Plus he loved the sounds and movement. This was a lifesaver. It was worth the money. We tried travel swings also and they didn't work at all - just this one. He still likes the swing at 8 months but now is getting a bit big for it. I can't rave about this enough!
1,swings much too hard,"We are returning the swing because it swings much too hard, even in the lowest setting, for our two-month-old baby. The instructions suggest attaching a dangling blanket if it swings too hard, but a) that didn't really help and b) if it's a common enough problem that they suggest a remedy then why not manufacture a chair with a lower setting?"
1,Frustrated with the product,"The swing is too fast for newborns. The motor is loud. The buttons are difficult to discern. I have no idea what the circle inside the circle means. I feel the mobile is too far away from the seat, the baby has no idea its there. Also, it is very difficult to determine if the legs are far enough apart to stabalize the swing."
2,Very odd squished seat...Not very comfy!,My son is 18 1/2 pounds and it's too small for him. The formation of the seat is very squished and I don't know why. There's no room to move or stretch or anything! Once the baby is in there he/she is stuck until someone takes him out. Kind of like a taco! The mobile toys are too low as my baby is always trying to reach up to them where as w/ another swing I have he just looks and enjoys. It's very difficult to adjust the seat positioning and my mom (who has this swing) has to turn the entire swing upside down to do it. Luckily we got this for $30 at a thrift store in brand new condition so even though it won't last much longer for my boy it won't be a total loss like it would if we had paid full price.
1,Not a good buy,"We have this swing. It worked for a couple of weeks, and now it wont swing and the mobile/dome doesnt work. This swing is a piece of junk. I have tried new batteries, it still didnt work.Also, the legs are unstable and when not sepearated completely to the max, the whole thing rocks as I push it. And I am not pushing it hard.I shouldnt even have to push it! Its a SWING its supposed to swing when turned on.How annoying."
2,Mobile quit working then Swing quit working,"I received this product for my baby shower in mid Nov, and baby was born end of Dec. About mid Jan the mobile quit working and now (mid June) the swing quit working. When we opened it up there was a disconnected wire. I am overall unhappy with this product, and don't recommned it to anyone."
4,Great....Almost,"I love this swing except for the fact that the sounds stop after 10- 15 minutes. Our baby falls asleep to the water sounds, and then wakes as soon as they go off. I have to stand near the swing and push reset several times so baby doesn't wake. That is the only thing I dislike about it, otherwise great!"
4,Peaceful rocking for baby,"The swing was very easy to put together (I did it myself at 34wks pg). It rocks very silently. The only issue I have with it, is that the lowest rocking setting goes too fast for my 35 wkr baby (preemie). We are waiting for him to get a little bigger before using it more."
4,Good swing but flaw in the mobile,The flaw isn't a safety issue but both myself and my nextdoor neighbor had the same thing occur. The motor for the fish mobile started making horrendous noises and just stopped working. For both of us this happened within 3 months of owning the swing. If it had just happened to me I would have thought it was a fluke. Other than this flaw - we loved the swing because of it's ability to swing two ways. One other gripe - why the heck don't they offer an AC/DC power input for these things. We literally went through 4 batteries a week (but my daughter had horrible acid reflux and would not sleep ANY other way but in this swing for a few months so it was worth it to us at the time.).
2,Noisy swing operation,"I had to rate this swing as a 2, because the motorized swing mechanism made a clicking noise that was so loud. Before purchasing the unit in October 2005, I tried to operate the display model at Target, but the batteries were dead. The swing had a nice fit and finish once assembled at home, but after putting batteries into the swing and turning it on, my wife and I couldn't believe the racket that the swing made. Before purchasing this unit, make sure that you actually listen to one operate at the store before purchasing it. After returning the unit to Target, we tried a display model Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing at BABYSRUS and it made the same noise as the one we returned.We ended up purchasing a Graco swing at BABYSRUS and are happier with it."
4,Great because of unique feature,"I really like this swing because it swings side to side (which is how my son likes it) as well as forward and back. I can put my 3-month old in it and he'll be calm and delighted for about an hour (which is a long time for a little baby). He actually didn't like being in the swing at all until after he reached 2 months, so don't be discouraged if your newborn at first does not take to it.I do agree though with some of the other reviews about it taking up alot of space, and it going too fast for little ones even in the lowest setting. But the feature mentioned above, along with the different sounds and settings make up for the 2 drawbacks."
4,near perfect,"We just bought this swing today and already know it's was a great investment. Our 8 week old son is totally relaxed almost instantly in the comfortable seat. He focuses in on the mobile right away because of the motion and colors. He suffers from bouts of colic and the different rocking motions calm his tummy. The only reasons we can come up with as to why this swing is not perfect are the speed and the music. Our son was 4 weeks premature. We would have not been able to use it until now because the swing motion is a little too fast for a newborn yet alone a preemie. The music is a little too ""high pitched"" for our tastes. All in all, we recommend this swing to everyone as it has given our child peace and comfort in just one day."
4,Great product for a younger baby,"This is a great product to help your baby go to sleep when you're having trouble. Naps or nighttime - if I was in a bind, this was the trick. There is a dome up above with soothing lights and fish. You can choose from music, nature sounds, or my favorite...white noise. I'm not sure if it truly makes a difference that you can let the baby swing front to back AND side to side, but it seems like if one isn't doing the trick, the other sometimes does."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT,"We have had this for 4 months now and I just can not say enough great things about it! Easy essembly, sturdy, safe, fun, entertaining, useful, I can go on and on. Yes, as it says in other reviews, it can be a bit loud, but the gentle clicks actually help put/keep my little guy asleep. He has refulx in a major way and this swing has helped him SOOO much. He talks to ""his fish, seahorse, and crab"" all the time, the lights put him to sleep when the music isn't playing. The plug in feature save so much $ and having the batteries in it helps a lot when the power goes out (very often here in Germany). BTW it doesn't mention it but it is DUAL VOLTAGE for those like us that don't want to have a bunch of converters around the house. Just pop on an adapter and you are all good! This is a total MUST have in my book!"
3,"Nice swing, needs lots of floor space","Having the option to swing front to back or side to side is a nice option on this swing, and the price is reasonable. On the downside, I wouldn't recommend this swing IF you do no have a lot of room. The legs on the swing take up a ton of space. I think the music is pretty lame, but it seems to calm the baby which is what counts. It is on a timer though,and I have to press the reset button all the time. I have used the swing for a month now and have not had to change the batteries yet. Also, I haven't had any trouble with loud motor noise as some people cited in their reviews. All in all, this is a nice swing for the price and I would recommend it as long as you have plenty of floor space."
5,Miracle swing,This is the best gift i ever got for baby shower. My little boy LOVES it. He has another swing that has all the bells and whistles but he hates it. This swing immediately puts him to sleep. He also enjoys looking at the mobile and lights above him. The only negative thing about this swing is that the music stays on for a very short time and I have to constantly turn it back on. But that's nothing compared to the time this swing gives me to take showers and tidy up around the house
5,can't live without it,"Our son sleeps so well in it. I will be sad when he's too big for it, which will be soon (8 months old). We use it every day for naps and we change the batteries every couple of months."
5,THE BEST ANYONE CAN HAVE!,"WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THESE SWING, I WASN'T SURE IF I SHOULD BUY IT BUT WHEN I LOOKED IT UP AND SAW IT, I KNEW MY DAUGHTER WOULD LOVE IT. I HAD A SWING ALREADY THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND, BUT YOU HAD TO ALWAYS WIND IT UP. BUT THESE AQUARIUM SWING CAN GO ON AND ON UNTIL YOU SHUT IT OFF OR THE BATTERY GOES OUT. MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT! IN THE DAY SHE GETS FUSSY SO I PUT HER IN IT AND THAT'S IT. AT NIGHT WHEN SHE WEAKS UP AND EATS AFTER SHES SATISFIED WE PUT HER IN THE SWING AND IN TEN MINUTES THAT'S IT SHES ASLEEP. MY HUSBAND AND I ARE SO PLEASED WITH IT THAT WE WOULD NOT CHANGE IT FOR ANYTHING."
5,Great Swing!,"This swing has been so helpful to me! My 3 month old loves the bright fish mobile as well as the ""glow ball"". She laughs and smiles at her ""fish friends"" often. I plan to pick up more Fisher Price Aquarium toys- they're definitely a hit! It is great to have a secure place to place her when I am doing housework or need a shower. Also, our daughter has reflux and needs to be upright for 30 min. after she eats. The seat is at a good angle for her, in the reclined position. The two options for movement are another nice bonus. This swing appears a bit larger than most- but you get more with this swing than you do with other models. Highly recommended."
4,Excellent swing...a real life saver!,"My daughter has adored this swing from the moment we got it for her at about one month. She loves the fish and when she was smaller (she is 5 months and 20 pounds now) she loved to doze off in it if it was in cradle swing mode. Now that she is bigger, she loves the traditional swinging. The only problem that I have had with it is that is sucks up batteries more than any other product that we have, but perhaps it is because it is so wonderful that we just use it all the time! I would recommend it to anyone. A definate must have."
4,Has been a lifesave for us!,"My daughter just turned a month old and at first we didn't set the swing up because a lot of reviewers said it goes too fast for a newborn. We set it up a week ago and it's been a lifesaver for us! Its one of the few ways we can get her to calm down. The swing is very cute and easy to use. You can do a combinaton of music/sounds and features- mobile on and water globe off, water globe on and mobile off, music on or off, and the music has a volume switch.The one downside is that it drains batteries pretty fast. I wish it had an adapter to it that plugs in. Fisher Price has great customer service though, we received the swing in August and after a week of use for some reason our mobile stopped working. I called them up today and after explaining the problem the operator said a new moter unit is being shipped out to me today! He also told us that if we have any more issues feel free to call back since the swing is under warrenty and they want their customers to be satisfied."
3,"Not bad, but has its faults","This swing is really attractive looking, and i love the way that it can easily be changed to swing from side to side, to forward and backwards. The motor is loud, as everyone says, so if I had this in my bedroom, I wouldn't be able to sleep with it while the baby was using it. Also, the biggest problem with it is that it is way too fast. Even on the lowest setting, it's faster than an enjoyable speed, especially for younger babies (newborns). I never even tried the higher speeds, because my baby can't adjust to the low speed. But I do use the swing for her to sit in when it's not moving (which i guess defeats the purpose i bought it for - to swing). She loves the hanging fishes."
3,"Good swing, but BE CAREFUL!!","I've had this swing since September 2006. Excellent swing for music, lights, entertainment, etc. HOWEVER--BE CAREFUL. There is a lock nut that attaches the tube from the cradle seat to the top of the globe. The ""lock nut"" on ours hasn't locked and today I found the washer in the cradle seat where my son could of easily picked it up and put it in his mouth and choked. Luckilly, I found the washer before anything tragic happend.I called Fisher Price to report this. They said that the washer should ""lock"" onto the screw and it shouldn't happen. Well, it did. I think after repetitive movement and weight from the swing the washer came loose.If you own this swing make sure the rounded part of the washer is faced out and the flat part of the washer is flat on the metal tube."
2,Defective Motor on two seperate swings.,"This is a great swing. My daughter bought it for her first baby. The baby loved the music. Close to a month after getting, the music started dragging. She changed the batteries a couple of times, but this didn't help. Finally returned to the store and got another one. Got home, and the music and mobile did not work right from the beginning. Ended up getting a different swing. Evidently this was just a bad batch, but not good for us."
4,Overpriced for the performance,"My baby never cared that much for this swing, which I had bought having read all the reviews. When he was smaller, around 2-3 months old, he would occasionally fall asleep there, but I would have to remove him, because to let a baby sleep there is a disservice to him: the seat is curved, so the baby is crumped there, and you can not straighten it up. ""Ocean wonders"" and fish did not entertain him at all ( unlike Fisher Price mobile). So, I would say the swing is way overpriced."
2,TOO FAST,"I bought this because a swing was essential when my little sister was a baby...however I was disappointed that the lowest speed setting is extremely fast for my son. He loves the bright colors and lights of the aquarium mobile, but the swing simply goes too fast to calm him down. Moreover, I don't feel that he's safe when the swing is turned on."
4,Good swing with speed problems,"This is a very nice product, however, the speed levels are not working properly. Speed 1 starts slowly but then the speed increases. We have to constantly have to turn off/turn on the swing to make sure it slows down to a comfortable level. Also, it's a bit difficult to sit the baby in and take the baby out of the swing without hitting the aquarium water globe - it's too low."
2,3-Point Harness Inadequate for a Swing!,"We used this swing until my daughter was about 6 months, because she couldn't pull herself up at all. But really, a swing should have a 5-point harness. It's crazy to me they would make one, like this one, with a 3-point harness that in any event is impossible to adequately tighten due to design. As soon as my daughter showed signs of enough strength to lift herself up, we were done with it. She did like it, though. But it needs a better restraint!The notion that you could use this until the child is 2, or even 25 pounds, is ludicrous. Without a 5-point harness, the child will try to climb out and may seriously injure him/herself."
5,best swing ever,"I bought this swing because it was the same as the bouncer i have and i loved the bouncer, plus this swing is so high tech! It has a light on the mobile that really grabs my sons attention. He just recently started grabbing for the fish. It was so adorable once he started recognizing the mobile and stuff he was in total awe. This is so great that the swing can swing both ways and when i put my son in it he can sleep for hours. I can actually get a little done around the house or get dressed for work. if he wakes up he stares at the mobile until he is rocked back to sleep! I left this review 5 years ago, I am pregnant again and I really regret selling this thing! This swing was way ahead of its time and I can't believe that it is still for sale after 5 years! I am going to have to buy another one!"
4,Great for my boys!,"I got this with my second boy and he loved it. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because of the motor, but the sound of the motor is comforting for baby. Now we have another baby boy on the way and I almost got rid of it since it wasn't being used but I didn't and our 3rd boy will recieve enjoyment out of it as well. The regular swings I didn't really like how my son could stop it by just grapping the side pole."
3,Decent Swing,We got this swing for our son and it worked great for the first few months. The battery life is rather good and our son seems to like it. The only con's I have are the songs gets old very quickly and my major complaint is sometimes it creeks which wakes my son up. As you all know just getting your child to sleep and having them woken up by a creeky swing can be very frustraiting.
5,Another Great Fisher-Price item,"My friends bought this as a shower gift for me, let me tell you it was the best thing ever! Our newborn won't sleep laying flat on his back, the swing had just enough elevation for his head and movement that would rock him to sleep. Now at 3 months he sleeps in his crib, but still loves to nap in his swing!"
4,An Absolute MUST,"We got this as a gift at our shower. It quickly became my families first choice. From the beginning it was great to help our daughter sleep when she is fussy. She loves to swing. We bring it with us when ever we travel. Of all the choices of things to entertain our daughter this one continutes to be No. 1.I love all the options that this swing has: different sounds, lights, swing directions, speeds, etc.I cannot say enough great things about this swing. The only downside is that the mobile stopped rotating. I wish that the purchaser had gotten the protection plan..."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!,"I have never written a review for a product before but this one deserves it. This swing saved our sanity. We had a colicky baby who would not sleep at night- unless he was in this swing. The side to side cradle motion was a life safer. We didn't use the ""music box"" but he did enjoy the wave sounds which sounded like rolling white noise. I have read other reviews complaining about it being loud, tipping over and bolts falling out... we had NONE of these problems. I would highly recommend this swing to all new parents. My son is almost 4 months old and it still works like a charm! It is worth every penny! I don't know what I would have done without it!!!!!"
5,Perfect!,"This was a first baby gift for us and we used in frequently even now with our second baby. Its very adaptable with three different speeds (for different ages/stages), upright and laid back seating positions as well as three way turning. Yes, its battery operated but seems to get its money worth and in between my two children we loaned it to four different friends and its still in great condition (removable/washable cover). SO its a KEEPER!"
5,Couldn't live without this,"AMAZING swing. My daughter has reflux and cannot lie down to sleep, so she naps in this swing all day...I'd use it at night also if it weren't too big to haul up my stairs. The recline is perfect and the music is beautiful--much more pleasant and Zen than most other products (no creepy kiddie singing!!). Only drawback is that the slowest speed is way too fast for my preemie...but she's almost 8 lb.s now and I think in a few weeks she'll be able to hang with the first speed. Also, the motor is sort of noisy, but I'm not giving this swing 4/5 stars for either reason, since I honestly don't know what I would do without this swing. A MUST HAVE for new parents."
5,Great Product Couldnt live without it,This swing is a lifesaver!! My daughter always slept in it. She preffered that rather than her bed most of the time. She loved the mobile it kept her occupied for a long time. We love all of the ocean wonders stuff but this is my favorite item they make. In order to preserve our pocketbooks to save money on batteries we actually hardwired it so we would plug it in and not use batteries.
3,Great to swing. Soothing music not a good accessory,We found this swing very comfortable for my daughter. She just looked so snug. The swing seems to like hug her. The problem we found was that 1. The music and the rotating mobile doesnt last long. You have to keep getting up to reset it. 2. The batteries dont last long either. You cannot even let the batteries get low because the music gets all warped and pitchy. What I did is put the Oceans Aquirium Crib Soother next to the swing and played that music instead. The music lasts longer and you dont have to change the batteries as often.
5,Fantastic Product,"It took our baby awhile to warm up to her swing. She wasn't wild about it for her first month, but ever since then she has loved it. The ""cradle"" shaped seat is wonderful for young infants....much better than your standard swings without head support. At four months she uses it often. It's great for rocking her to sleep for a nap. In fact, it's so useful that I have to remind myself to get her out of there for hands-on play more often! My only criticism...I wish there was an option to extend the time that the music plays. The automatic shut-off happens too soon."
5,AMAZING!!!!!,"we recieved this swing as a shower present for my son, who is now 2 1/2. he loved it, and would sit in the swing and watch everything for 20 minutes at a time, at least! he didnt even have to be moving, he just loved to be in the swing watching everything! my daughter, however, did not care for the swing much at all, the colors alone were too overwhelming for her, not too mention that she would freak out when i would turn the globe, mobile or music on. i still give it 5 stars, because the experience i had with my son was so amazing! it saved my sanity and helped him to relax!"
3,Save your money,"I have 4 month old twins and ended up with one Ocean Wonders Swing and one of the ""Jungle"" swings which cost $20 less - both babies are totally unimpressed by the water and light feature - only once when the power went out and all the lights were off did my son even notice the lights on the ""aquarium"". Plus the lights seem to make this swing eatup batteries twice as fast as the other swing"
3,A few drawbacks...,"Overall, a nice swing. However, the motor is quite loud (clicks with each swing) and there doesn't seem to be much speed control-- wish there was a slower, gentler swing speed-- way too fast for a new born. The adjustable swing direction is a nice feature, although when my son was young, I found that with the cradle (front to back) motion, his head would lean forward and then tip back."
3,"Great swing, but squeaky!","When my daughter was born she slept in her swing a lot, but it didn't have anything to keep her entertained while she was awake. Seeing as I'm a stay at home mom, I need somewhere to set her down while I make dinner and she was just bored to tears in the plain, no bells and whistles, swing. She LOVES the mobile on this swing, as well as the water globe and nature sounds. The swing itself is pretty nice. The only drawback is that after ONE week in this swing, it started to make this squeaky creaky sound. OMG, it's awful. I'm listening to it right now and it literally sounds like it might fall apart. I think it really bothers my daughter because she now has a hard time napping in it. She is only 12lbs too, so FAR below the weight limit on the swing. She's not even two months old, and I'm sad to say that we'll probably be breaking out the old no frills swing before she outgrows this one. I don't think WD-40 will work on plastic! I am so frustrated."
2,"too fast, and too short","This swing is nice for babies aged 4 months, perhaps. My daughter at 7 months could grab the mobile, and she couldn't ""fit"" into it until maybe 2-3 months. It swings insanely fast (unless the batteries are weak), and the corners will actually will lift up off the ground at times. Now, at 8 months and 15.5 pounds, if I put my daughter in it, it moans and creaks like she is too heavy. The first swing I bought was LOUD, and I brought it back to the store, this one is better, but I think there are better ones, and worse ones out there."
4,Awesome while you can!,"Well, we bought this swing and the crying stopped! WOW! The only problem is that it was short lived joy we experienced. Within a short period of time (a few months) our little girl no longer wanted to be in it. :( Maybe we bought it when she was too old already? (3 months) I am really not too sure. But when #2 comes along, I know what to use ;)"
3,"Great in the beginning, but then outgrew fast","THis swing was great when my son was a few weeks old. He was picky and sometimes did not want to swing front to back so this was great because of being able to swing side to side. Many times this helped him settle down and go to sleep when nothing else would.The swing goes too fast though. We always used the lowest setting and had to tuck a blanket under him to hit the floor to slow it down.And it says its good till they are 25 pounds. NOT TRUE! My son is currently 19 pounds and this swing stopped swinging with him in it a few weeks ago. WHen I take him out and turn it on, its fine but will not swing anymore. Thats a bummer because he loves it still but I cant put him in it unless its just to sit in."
3,Too fast on lowest setting!,"The swing has six speed settings, but what use are they if even the lowest setting is too fast?!! My baby is 3 months old now and weighs 13 pounds, and we can finally use the swing, although it is still a little faster than I'd like. The manual that comes with the swing acknowledges the problem in its troubleshooting section, but says it's ""normal operation."" It suggests tucking a blanket under the baby and letting it drag on the floor to slow the swing down. That's ridiculous! They should have the lowest speed setting be appropriate for small babies and the higher speed settings for bigger babies.I would give the swing an even lower rating, except that my baby likes it now. She falls asleep reliably in it after about 10 minutes of swinging, at which point I turn it off and let her nap in it. The seat is very soft and comfortable for her."
5,"Great swing, would buy again if I had to do it over again!","Great design, my son loved it! However, he's a big boy and grew out of it very soon. I found that the closer to the max weight he got that the swing would stop swinging. The batteries burn out quickly too. I felt like a slave to diapers and batteries. Which seemed a little premature to me since he was only 4 months and couldn't play with toys yet. ;o)"
3,Waste of money,This is a great swing if you want to put new batteries in every week. It is well worth the extra $10 to get another swing that can plug into an outlet. It also has a timer in it so it will shut off the music and mobile after to many minuites. You have to go over and push the reset button everytime this happens. 4 size D batteries every couple of weeks adds up fast. The plug in swings never shut off unless you shut them off. Much better buy.
2,Missing Parts,"Problems weren't with product itself, but with seller. Amazon and it's sub-sellers are so interwoven, I have no idea who I actually bought it from. Judging from the tape job on the box, product was more than likely another client's return, and nobody had taken time to ensure that all parts were included... which they were not. I'm way too busy to deal with the hassle of a return, and, forturnately, the missing parts were decorative (the dangling stuffed fish for the mobile), so we just made do by adding in some after-market ornamentation."
2,Buy Another Swing !!!!,I received this swing from a gift from my mother. She got this swing because all of the great reviews on this swing. In two weeks the motor stopped working. I returned it to the store (thank god I got the insurance). One week later the music stopped and then the motor again. I going to return the swing again to the store and find something else. The motor is loud (It's bad when you are trying to sleep). A lot of people said the swing is too fast however my baby enjoys it.If you decide to buy any swing buy the insurance with it. You might have a similar problem.
4,She Loves to Swing!,"My little girl loved this swing! Mommy and Daddy loved this swing! The only problem with it is we wore it out... it still swings just fine and the light works but the sounds and the mobile don't work any more... when they did work they were great, no annoying sounds to drive a frazzled parent up the wall and the fish mobile really caught my little girls attention (she still likes looking at them... the light is really soothing and not too bright...she almost always fell asleep by the time the sound turned off... we also loved that you were able to turn the swing to go side to side, when she was very little this worked the best for us... all in all a great ""must have"" for us!"
3,My son likes it,"This is a good swing compared to most, but it has a lot of faults, too. If you put it on a faster setting (which my son loves) it rocks a lot and the feet can come up off the floor a bit. I've tried spreading the feet farther apart and this still happens. It also EATS batteries. I've been using mine for about five months and we have to change the batteries every other week. I don't even want to think about how much money that is. When the batteries start to slow down, the swing is really really slow.. which makes my son mad. :/ Overall this is a good swing, just be prepared to buy tons of batteries or get rechargeable ones."
4,"very engaging, even for a 7-week old","My husband and I bought this for our nephew when he was 7 weeks old and he loves it! It was amazing to see him zero in and focus on the fish swirling about in the mobile and the bright happy colors of the fabric side panel. He was completely entranced!My brother and hubby said it was fairly easy to assemble, though none of these things is really easy. I think they got it done in about 20 minutes.It has a relatively large footprint. When using the swing in the back-to-front swing direction, the right leg tends to lift slightly off the floor (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but I don't think there's any way it could tip or be unstable. I haven't seen it used in the side-to-side cradle mode yet. I do think the large footprint adds to the stability.After seeing how much my nephew (and his parents) enjoy this swing, my husband and I changed our registry from the Papasan swing to this one. Less money and more features? Yeah, that's the way to go!"
5,Super Swing!,This swing is fabulous! My daughter is 5 weeks old and we have been using the swing for the past few weeks. She is mesmerized by the fish on the mobile and is content to swing in it for as long as we'll let her. I'm happy that she has a fun and safe place to be while I get stuff done around the house. She giggles her head off in this swing -- it's a great investment!
4,Great swing for a very happy baby!,"My son loved this swing since he was born. Of course, in the beginning he wasn't interested in the mobile, all he wanted to do was relax and sleep. And boy did he sleep in this swing!! He could not get enough of it. He loved the soothing music and the rocking motion- front to back and side to side - of the swing together. Around a month and a half, he started getting interested in the mobile, and would not stop gazing and staring at the little fishes! He still loves it now that he is nearly three months old and although he doesn't sleep as much, it keeps him entertained for hours. The only drawback is that now that he is a little heavier - 12 pounds - I need to put the swing on the highest setting, and it burns the 4D batteries really quickly... but overall, this swing rocks!!!"
5,A Must-Have!,"I bought this two years ago for my first son and now using it for my second son. They both love this, especially when it has a horizontal swing motion and the rotating fishes with lighting. The sounds are helpful too. My second son would rather be in his swing than be carried all the time. Would definitely buy this again if I had to. Btw, my first son used this until he was 1.5 yo. even when his head would touch the pole because he was too tall for it. He loved it."
3,Works great... but mobile does not lift.,"This swing is wonderful and we have had it about a year, but it's not as convenient as our rainforest swing was with our first child. The Ocean Wonders swing does not have the option for the mobile to lift up while placing baby in or taking out of the crib. I actually miss that feature a lot. My only other complaint is that it's a bit on the noisy side compared to other swings. Our second baby actually does better with lots of noise, but this swing would not have worked with our sound-sensitive toddler when she was a newborn!"
3,Nice and cozy but,"even on the lowest speed its to fast for infants under 10 pounds. Looking forward to seeing if my daughter likes it as she grows into it better. She's 8 weeks, and right now its too much for her."
2,Runs through batteries!,"The swing is cute with its design etc,...Takes up alot of floor room. This swing goes through D batteries every 2 weeks, gets expensive. I suggest getting a swing that will plug directly into a outlet. I found that the mobile on the swing to be a real pain, when you are getting the baby in and out. Bop the babies head on the mobile. Sold ours on craigslist and purchased a plug in swing."
5,"The 3 SSS's Swinging, Swaddling ,Sucking=Happy Baby!","Finally, my husband bought me a swing for our last baby and let me tell you it was worth every penny!!! Swinging does mimick the motion that your baby happily experienced in your belly and she was soothed. By the time they are too big to be in the swing they don't really want to be in it anymore because they are busy exploring. My daughter loved the lights and the fish, the music was an added bonus. The swing cleaned up very well so I was able to pass it on to the next person although it was difficult!"
5,Loved it!!,"This swing was a life saver. I received the swing as a shower gift and we used it until our son outgrew it. I highly recommend this to any parent or grandparent. At first I thought it was a bit pricey, but was well worth the money. I hated to see it go."
5,Would buy it again,We got this for our first child over 2 years ago and have now used it for 8 months so far with our 2nd child. I don't know what I would have done without this swing for both kids. It really helped both of the them with naps (swinging or not) and since our 2nd child rolled over constantly from age 4 months and on we often had him in it for sleeping to keep him safer than tummy sleeping. My husband rigged it up to a A/C adapter so we didn't have to use any batteries (that would be the only thing I'd change is to have the manufacturer include that). I really liked that you could turn the swing 2 different ways. I do think that maybe the mobile turning was a bit loud but is didn't seem to bother either child. Would buy it again.
4,Darn D Batteries!!!,"Like many others, I think that the swing is terrific. The biggest downfall is that it takes 4 Alkaline D Batteries & there is no AC/DC Adapter for the thing. Then there is the timer issue about the lights, mobile and noises. They time out about every 5-7 min. Fisher Price, you should have made an AC ADAPTER!!! I even went to far as to see if my husband could fiddle with the swing to make our own AC Adaptor, however he was afraid that it would blow the mechanics. Now I am on the search for a battery charger that will charge 4 D batteries all at once...wish me luck!Overall...I would have to say I like the swing, and hate Fisher Prices' dicision making abilities!"
4,Great swing!!,"This is a great swing, and I do not regret getting it at all. My son loves it!! He loves looking up at the lights and the fish above him and reaching for the toy fish hanging over his head. It keeps him very entertained, and it gives him a little bit of change from going in one motion being that you can turn it to the side. It's very comfortable for him and has great padding and he goes right to sleep in this swing. The only drawback is the batteries. I have gone through more batteries then I thought I would. But its worth it for my sons comfort!"
4,Love Fisher-Price,We love this swing. The side to side swinging is great for younger babies. My son and the baby I nanny for both nap in this swing every day. We did have a problem when the motor started acting funny after a couple months but we called Fisher-Price and they sent us a new top piece right away. I don't know what we'd do without this swing.
5,Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!!,Of course it makes noise -- get used to it...with a baby - noise will be a constant part of life!! What is more important...the baby getting used to having a bit of noise around and you getting some sleep...or quiet???
1,Swing only lasted 9 months!,This swing only lasted 9 months. The music would still play but the swing would not swing and my daughter is small for her age. She is 18 months old now and only weighs 20 lbs. You would do better to buy the Aquarium travel swing. We used it more than the big swing because our daughter preferred it. It has held up very well.
5,Ocean Wonders vs. Rainforest,"I had initially owned the Fisher-Price 'Rainforest' swing. At first, it worked awesome and my baby seemed to enjoy it. After only 2 months of using it, the motor started sounding awful! Even on the highest setting, it failed to move my 14 pound baby (the maximum weight limit is 25!). I returned that swing and purchased this one. So far, I have absolutely no complaints with it. I would actually recommend this one over the 'Rainforest' swing for many reasons. A big plus is the added space you get below this swing; the 'Rainforest' swing seems to be bigger and lower to the ground. It also is very quieter and seems to a better job at entertaining the baby, with more toys to look and interact with."
2,Good But Costly,My six month old loved this swing. We thought it was great but then we realized that the swing was going through 4 d batteries a week. We have only had the swing for 5 1/2 months and to top it all off the motor went out. My review is based on our swing. I was just disappointed about the motor.
3,Lock,"I did not like the swing that much, I would say it was ok. now that my daughter is 8 months and crawls we had to put it back in its box and take it into the attic. The reason: it does not have a lock, my daughter keeps holding it to stand up and for sure she will fall. Consider that when buy one! I can't use it anymore."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I've been using this swing for 2 months now. At first I liked it. But as my child gets older [almost 3mos] I am liking it less and less. The bar behind the head makes it more likely that you will bang their head puting them in and out of the swing. Also, I have never seen the difference between all the speeds and after changing batteries twice in the last month, the swing barely moves no mater what speed it is set to."
3,you pay for bells and whistles,"I will not argue, this is a good swing. however, my daughter was 4 months before she began to enjoy the fish and lights, etc. it was very useful for naps and putting her down for a minute. i got it as a gift so it wasnt a problem, but a plain swing with a mobil would do just as well. also, the tray is a pain to use, we took it off and just buckled her in.as far as safety is concernd - pretty stable on lower speeds, less stable on higher ones. it rocked back and forth, alternatley lifting one leg or the other, off the floor. not enough to cause concern, but enough to notice.We bought rechargeable batteries - the music and lights are what zapp the batteries of their juice, so we often just put the swing on and play a lullby CD..works just as well, and saves the battery juice.I wouldnt pay this much money on my own, but if someone wants to buy it, great."
4,"Great swing, gives you a little sanity","We purchased this swing (along with the entire ocean wonders product line) and are very happy with it. Since this is our 1st child all of our friends told us to get a swing. I'm glad we took their advice. Our daughter loves the mobile and music and always falls asleep in it.CONS: The motor is pretty loud, we thought ours was defective until seeing everyone else's comments on that same issue. Also, it is a pain to always hit that reset button to make the music turn back on. I'm sure it saves on batteries in the long run, but I'd rather have that as an option.Overall, we love our swing. It has a lot of options for the money, and our daughter couldn't be happier."
5,GOD BLESS FISHER PRICE!,"That's what my husband and I nick-named this swing. Just like most other reviewers, we cannot sleep without it some nights. Our daughter was a preemie (34 weeks) and has loved this swing from the moment she came home a week after birth. The mobile is not ""too loud"" like other reviewers said...and the fishies really keep baby entertained. I couldn't have survived the first 3 months without this swing.The best advice I can give new or expecting parents...DEFINITELY BUY THIS SWING!!!"
1,THIS SWING STINKS!!!!,"I bought this swing for my first son and this swing was loud and rocked too hard. Well, 1 yr. later the motor burnt out and fisher price sent me a new one-very nice of them too. :-), but this swing requrires so many batteries. When will they learn to make a plug in swing? That would be smart. I give it one star, cuz both of my boys liked to sleep in it."
1,GREAT WHILE IT LASTED,"MY SON LOVED THIS SWING AND SO DID I, I COULD LET HIM SWING EVERY MORNING WHILE I CLEANED THE HOUSE WELL THATS OVER MY SON WILL BE 4 MONTHES SOON AND THE SWING MOTOR JUST STOPPED WORKING IT LASTED ONLY ALMOST 4 MONTHS GOOD THING I BOUGHT THE OCEAN WONDERS TAKE ALONG SWING ALSO HE NEVER LIKED IT AS MUCH AS HIS BIG SWING BUT IT IS SAVING THE DAY FOR ME,SO THE BIG ONE IS IN THE GARBAGE AND MY SON IS USING THE SMALLER VERTION I LOVED THIS SWING MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS IT WAS A BATTERY EATER AND IT DIED AFTER 4 MONTHS ONLY"
2,Should have listened to all reviews,"We purchased this item fully knowing all of the problems we could encounter. Our baby at three months old was 16lbs, he has just turned 4 months and is almost 19 lbs, yet this product's swing on the lowest setting is so fast we can not turn it above the first setting and we have to slow it down by adding heavy blankets to it. When our son came home from the hospital at 7lbs 10 oz, it almost catapulted him across the room. I am so glad it has a waist harness. After 3 months of use the fish no longer rotate. We have changed out the batteries per the instructions and they still do not work. I am going to contact fisher price and see what they can do for us. So we have a reckless swing that does not function correctly. Otherwise the concept is nice and we use it as a great place for our son to nap on a still setting while we are doing housework in the room with him. Hmmm, should have just stuck with my bouncer."
5,OUR SWING IS NOT LOUD AT ALL!,"Maybe they have improved it? I'm not sure, but this swing has been a lifesaver! Our son (12weeks old yesterday) currently sleeps all night in his swing. We originally were putting him in his papasan chair, because he woke so frequently in his crib, but after watching the ""HAPPIEST BABY ON THE BLOCK"" DVD by Dr. Harvey Karp (also worth every penny!) we took his suggestion and put our son in the swing. HE HAS SLEPT THRU THE NIGHT EVER SINCE!!! Thank you Fisher Price!"
4,WOW,"I have recently purchased this item. I have not yet had the baby, but my brother and sister-in-law just had a little girl. We have put her in it and to our surprise she loved it. She slept in it for at least 3 to 4 hours with no whines or cries. I think this purchase is going to be a very good thing for me when I have my baby. I highly recommend it to all of you. One little problem the music does shut off after one tune is played this has to be my biggest down fall about it. If your a patient parent it won't be a problem to push reset. Kassikat Houston,TX"
5,LOVE this swing!!!,Since my son was born he has loved this swing. After a couple weeks he learned to watch the lights and the fish on the mobile. I can do things around the house and feel comforted that he's enjoying himself and comfortable. The seat cover is easy to wash and the swing is easy to take apart and put away if needed. I love the look of this and he absolutely enjoys it!
4,Good swing...,"I put my baby in this from the start. It does go rather fast though, so I would sit and slow it down by hand. She looked lost in it at first (she was 5 lbs. at birth) but she grew into it. For some reason, my baby is really attracted to fish (will lay and look at Finding Nemo), so the theme is great. She is four months now and seems to be frustrated at times that she cannot reach up and get the fish. And she seems to want to sit upright, so end up taking her out. I will say that it will eat up batteries. I am on my 3rd set. I also find that it is a bit larger than the older type swings. I love it though, and even though she seems to want to get up and go, it does put her to sleep when all else fails."
4,Daughter LOVES her swing,"My daughter loves this swing. We are able to change the position to give her different views of the room and the recline position is perfect.The fish on our swing stopped rotating after having the swing for 4 months, I called Fisher Price and they sent us a replacement via UPS free of charge. Great customer service!!"
3,"good, mostly","For the most part the swing is good. My daughter likes it, when it works. We have had to replace the motor housing 3 times. It's frustrating because we have spent the money on an item that doesn't work, and we have to keep waiting to recieve the part. I have heard this has happened to others as well."
4,"Great Swing, but they need to fix the motor defect!","We started using this swing immediately after my daughter was born. It was a little too fast for her at first but she just loved looking at the fish and it always seemed to soothe her. If it had continued to work as great as it did when we first bought it, I would have given it 5 stars. However, after just a couple months we had to start replacing the batteries every couple weeks. The music sounded like it was dying and you would have to physically push the swing to get it going. I finally called Fisher Price and they were great about it. I guess mine has a defective motor. I will say that my mom and sister both bought the same one for their houses and have never had problems."
5,Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"Absolutely LOVE this swing. We also have a regular Graco three speed open top and a portable swing. Of the three, this one takes the cake. Our little guy will swing in it for hours. The cradle swing is great for the smaller baby and easily converts to a regular front swing. He loves to watch the fish in the aquarium up above. The music plays for 7 minutes... a lot of people made comments about wishing it were longer, it's simple to turn back on... Also read reviews about the motor being loud - we hesitated to buy due to that review however we made ToysRus put batteries in the swing so we could hear it and it's not loud at all. Have no negative comments on this item, would highly recommend to all. I would buy again!!! Love the entire Ocean Wonders line! Well worth the money!"
3,"It's nice, could be better","I got this for my grandson and I was a little disappointed. The music and lights are just OK. Not really loud enough or bright enough and not enough variety. The batteries don't last very long, a couple weeks. When my girls were little we had ones you could wind up and they'd run 30 minutes or longer, no batteries needed. You can adjust this to swing either side to side or front to back, but I think it's over priced for what you get."
4,This swing rocks!,"Yes, pun intended. My son loves it. I love it. Everyone is happy. The only complaint I have is that the music and little fish mobile turn off automatically and the change in noise wakes up my VERY light sleeper. If your baby is a deep sleeper it's probably not a problem."
3,"Loved it w/ the 1st baby, didnt last for the 2nd.","I used this swing for my 1st baby, lent it to my sister for her's where her hubby rigged it up to take an adpter, which is great but the motor burnt out when I got it back to use it for the new baby. He was able to order a new motor and it's working great, but just today one of the light bulbs burnt out in the overhead globe so now I'm searching for a replacement for that. I agree, it is a bit fast for a small baby, but my 2nd baby was born at 11 lbs, so it seemed to weigh it down a little more. I think there are better swings out there to purchase, but my children really loved the fishies and the lights on this one..."
5,great cradle swing,"I love this swing! My 4.5 month-old twin babies love to sleep in it. I have two complaints: 1. The batteries run out fast. I had to invest in rechargeable batteries. 2. The weight limit is 25lbs. If you have a big baby like my son (he is 20+ lbs at 4.5 months), he would outgrow it soon."
4,Overall Best Thing We Bought For Our Son,"This swing was a LIFE SAVER!!! With minor draw backs. Our son loved it from the first time we put him in it (4 weeks). This is the only place we could get him to sleep for awhile. He also loved the mobile. The swing was soothing yet stimulated him when he wasn't sleeping. He loves the ""wave"" sound it makes although it didn't ever last long enough for him(automatic switch off). Another draw back is the way it goes through batteries!!! We had to replace them about every 2 weeks. Also as my son got heavier, at about 3 months, the swing always had to be on the 6th swing setting, it wouldn't even move at any other setting. But like I said minor draw backs, my son is now 5 months and doesn't use it anymore, as he has learned to fall asleep on his own."
5,babylove23,"This swing is woth its weight in gold. We were attracted to the versatility of the side-to-side or front-back motion. Unlike traditional swings, it's very hard for your child to fall out or for the swing to tip over because of inverted V position of the frame. In addition to music, it also plays ocean waves, babbling brook and rain shower noises, which seemed to calm our son more than the music. Though the music/sounds and the fish mobile stop after 10 minutes or so, the swing can go for hours - our son slept in it all night a few times. The swing does move pretty fast for a newborn because there isn't enough body weight to slow it down but just add a blanket as they recommend."
3,NOT FOR NEWBORN,"My 6 wk old sleeps well in this swing, but it's a little too much power & space for my comfort. In no way should this swing be listed ""from birth"".There are many great things about this swing so I gave it a 3-star, but I'd suggest keeping a close eye on baby.CONSNo neck supt. My boy has a pretty strong neck at 6-wks, but there is no supt so when I turn around his head crimps down towards his shoulders. We now use our infant car seat neck wings to hold his head straight.The seat does not lean back far enough. His head literally falls forward & hits his mouth on the tray. This is 100% unacceptable for this to be able to happen.The swing is WAY TO FAST! We don't put him in the swing after eating cause we're worried he'll throw up from swinging so fast.The lowest speed is the same speed as the highest speed.Hope this helps."
3,pretty good swing but with some negatives,"My son enjoys spending time in this swing. It's comfortable and has lots of features. The batteries last a long time as well. However, it does have a few drawbacks. For example, the motor is very loud, it takes up a fair amount of space, and the music stops after only a few minutes making it necessary to keep hitting ""reset."""
2,Baby loved it while it worked,"The two swinging motions are great. My baby loved the side to side. She didn't seem to interested with the lights and water globe though. This swing broke after about 1 month of light to moderate use. It just stopped swinging. New batteries did not fix the problem. I returned it, under Babies r Us great return policy, and purchased the Nature's Touch Baby Papasan Cradle Swing. So far so good with the new swing. It has much better sounds, a mirror instead of a water globe, and the seat has at least 2 times as much padding, probably more. Check out both before purchasing. The Nature's Touch is about $30 more. If it lasts it will definately be worth it for me."
5,Good for older babies - not newborns,My baby was 8 weeks old before she started enjoying this. It was too big for her before hand
4,Daughter Didn't Like It,"In all fairness, my daughter just didn't like to swing but this swing really is a nice one. It eats the batteries pretty quick but I think that this is one of the best swings on the market."
4,A great swing until baby gets too heavy...,"This swing is great because different babies prefer different swinging directions -- and some like both! The music is very soothing and peaceful, as are the nature sounds, and the volume control is great. Unlike many other Fisher Price products that only have two settings (too quiet and too loud), this product has a dial so you can set it at exactly the volume you like.When my daughter was very small, she would sleep in this swing, and now at 5 months, she likes to play with the toys on the tray and watch the fish mobile above. (No chance of her sleeping in it now when there is so much to look at!) The only downside I've found so far is that the heavier she gets, the slower the swing goes, and even on the highest speed it's extremely slow now (even with brand new batteries). She's only 15 pounds and the swing is supposed to go up to 25 pounds (I think) so by then, it probably won't even budge!"
5,My Son Loved This!!,"This was great. It was not only cute- but it made my son happy. It was often the only way he would take long naps. He loved the fish that moved around, the light up globe and the music. We had no complaints- except that he eventually grew out of it. My husband wished there was one for him as well.We were very happy with this swing."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!!!","We recived the Cradle Swing as a gift for our 5 week old daughter and she loves it. I don't know what we would do without this swing. Before we would hold our daughter all day since she would only take 20 minute naps here and there. I love how you don't have to have everything going on at once, just what you need. It's quiet when in motion, none of that click click noise. It took me about 20 minutes to put it together it was really easy. I probably love it even more than she does as it lets me cook dinner, do laundry, or just relax. If you only splurge on one item for your baby this is definitely THE ONE, it is worth every penny!"
3,Defective swing???,"At first, we loved this swing.It was the only thing that would calm our baby down when she was crying incessantly.We had the same batteries in it for some time.Suddenly,the musical sounds would play when we had it on the water sounds,the music would turn off if we turned the mobile on,or the swing would stop moving once the music stopped(it is on a timer).We replaced the old batteries with brand new ones,but it's still acting up.Now it won't even turn on and the new batteries have only been in it for a day.We are taking it back to exchange it at Toys R Us tonight for the same product.Hopefully we won't have the same issue.We have only been using it for 7 weeks! Update-after being told at the store that others had the same problem,we upgraded to the Nature Swing.I now have a review under that product on this site."
4,"Baby loved it, but hardware kept falling out.","My son LOVED this swing. When he refused to go to bed at night it was the only thing that gave us any peace. The lights and colors, the music, the ability to change directions and speeds -- all were wonderful! Our only complaint is that the hardware that held the swing in place (kept it from tilting) kept falling out and was eventually lost. I know you can reorder parts from Fisher Price (for a fee) and we plan to do that with baby #2. Still, this piece falling out creates a safety issue and I feel they should be willing to at least replace the part for free if they weren't willing to repair whatever is causing it to fall out in the first place. It's only a few dollars, but it's irritating."
5,HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF IT SWINGING TOO FAST FOR SMALL BABIES,I just saw a review that mentioned that this swings too fast for little babies. We used this for my son that was a preemie--4 1/2 pounds. His doctor recommended one like this that swings side to side. We slowed down the swinging by hanging a blanket off the seat and letting it drag on the ground. It slowed it down enough to make it gentle for a tiny baby.This swing was wonderful--he loved it!! He used it right up until he reached the weight limit. Sometimes it was the only way to get him to nap.It has our highest recommendation!!!
3,"Great features, but did I get a lemon?","When I bought this swing I felt it had the most baby-distracting features that I could find. It was perfect for occupying my son and helping him fall asleep when he was really little. The music could be better, but the other sound effects were pretty good, esp. the ocean waves.Only problem: the rotating mobile kept getting stuck in one spot and after a while it wouldn't move at all.FYI, we did not feel it wasted batteries.One last comment: it seems Fisher Price tries to have good features in their toys but they have quality issues. We also have the Ocean Wonders aquarium, which many babies love, and again, the fish get stuck while moving around. Is it that hard to get it right? It seems like they've put less TLC into making their products than they used to."
3,Cute but broke within 2 months!,"We initially loved this swing for our twins but found that as the babies got older, the swing movement slowed down. This seemed to irritate our babies. We were also using the Papasan Cradle Swing at the same time and our babies preferred that one. The chair on the Ocean Wonders was not as comfortable as the Papasan Swing. Our babies rarely fell asleep in the Aquarium Swing but they always did in the other. They did enjoy the lights and the fishes on the mobile. Unfortunately, the swing just stopped working last night and it gave us just under two months of use.Update: I spoke with Fisher-Price Customer Service this morning and they are replacing the motor housing which will arrive in 7 to 10 days. It was a very easy process to contact the company and I was off the phone within five minutes! With that type of response, I would now rate the product at 4 Stars!!"
3,"If you buy this swing, buy the insurance!","My son loves this swing. We got it for him when he was two months old and he loved being in it and watching the lights and mobile. The mobile stopped working after only one month. I have continually tried contacting fisher price, but the hold time is to long and when you contact them via their website they never call you back. I regret not buying the insurance on this product. Other than that problem I really liked this swing."
2,"good swing, quality of question","I have read multiple excellent reviews on this swing, but the motor on our swing broke within 3 months. Maybe we were just one of the unlucky ones but my sister in law bought the same swing and their swing has to be returned too. Otherwise my twins loved the fish mobile and the music!!!"
5,LIFE SAVER!,This swing is absolutley awesome. I don't think we could get by without it. It takes no longer than 10 minutes to put my son right to sleep even when he is already fussy. I recomend buying a battery charger and rechargable batteries though because you will save a lot of money that way. Also if you have hard wood floors beware...this thing likes to move about the room. But other than that its GREAT!
3,Its great but..,"We got this as a gift and at first it worked quite well.The safety harness is easy to use. And it even doubled as a feeding chair for our little one.The only thing is that eventually although you can hear the motor running, it no longer swings the baby. Other parents we spoke to who own this model had the same comment.Also, I wish that there was an option to power it from the mains instead of just batteries. Rechargeable batteries don't do very well in it.If there is a model which can be powered from the mains I'd recommend it over this one."
4,one i am glad to have!!,"i got this for my grandson,he loves being in the swing and watching the lights and fish thumbs up on this one"
3,"Nice, but is large, uses excessive batteries and broke","I got this item as a gift from my employees at work. My husband chose this for our registry. Anyway, it is really nice and cute, but is really large for a smaller room, uses 4 d batteries almost every other week with use, and now the entire motor unit is broken after only 3 months of use. Fortunatly, the wonderful people at fisher price are replacing the unit at no charge to us!! There is a date code on the unit and I guess that proved that the item did not hold up. I personally would have liked something a little smaller and maybe something that would have a little less battery use. Also, like many reviews I read, this item does swing a little fast for my infant."
5,The Magic Sleep Machine,"If I had had this swing earlier instead of the one I bought originally, life would have been a lot easier! My four and a half month old does not sleep long hours at night, and he does not really nap either. This swing has helped us establish a daytime nap routine, and it rescues us when our baby decides it is time to play for an an hour at 3:30 a.m. and at 5:30 a.m. Into the swing for baby and then off to dreamland for the whole family!! We put it together one morning at 4: a.m., and I spent the whole next day looking at it lovingly as I watched my baby nap, nap, nap. Buy it!!!"
5,LIFESAVER!,"The motor is a bit on the loud side and the sideways swinging back and forth was too fast for my little one at first, but at about 2 months of age, he began LOVING it. He was born 6 weeks early and I was concerned that he was so little in it, but the padding is great and he was fine and didn't slump. At first he didn't care about the mobile and lights, but the swinging helped him sleep and I was able to get a shower every day!! Now he LOVES the mobile and lights, too. In fact, he likes them enough that even when he isn't sleepy, he will sit quietly and watch them while I grab my shower, put away laundry, etc. It does take up a fair amount of space and I only use it upstairs in my Master Suite's sitting room. I am considering moving it downstairs, but the lights won't be prominent if I do. We received this as a gift from his grandparents - I just wish he wouldn't outgrow it since it costs so much."
5,Love this swing!!,This swing got our family through two babies with colic. I can't believe it hasn't broken down from all the use. Can't tell you how great it is. Highly recommended!!
3,"To Fast, To Bulky, To Loud","The Ocean Wonders Aquarium swing has a huge price tag for not coming with an a/c adapter. We were replacing the batteries every two weeks. The motor on the swing is so loud it drowns out the music and ocean sounds:o(The speed is so fast not even the recommended extra blanket weight slowed it down:o( The time out feature for the music and mobile aren't long enough, we had to repeatedly walk over and restart them or my pumpkin would wake up or get upset. If you are going to buy this swing wait till you child is at least 6mos old or over 13lbs. it's just to big and doesn't have the support for a new born.The swing is pretty heavy and not easy to move around so, have a space designated for the swing. You wont want to be lugging it up and down stairs thats for sure. I would say calling it a Cradle Swing is a stretch! We are going to try the Fisher Price Rain Forest one that comes with the a/c adaptor and see if we have any better luck."
2,doesn't last! motor was replaced and broke again!!!,"I loved this swing with my daughter. She slept in it for naps and overnight. Batteries didn't last long, but I didn't expect them too because we were using it so much.When my son was born, we used it with him and he got used to sleeping in it too. Then one day, the motor just quit! Even with new batteries in it, it wouldn't swing. I called the company and even though I was ""past the waranty period"", they made a ""one-time exception"" and sent me out a new motor. It only worked for about a week. My friend has had the same problem. It doesn't seem to be able to handle the weight it is advertised to. I think it says up to 25 lbs but my son was only ~15 lbs when it quit working! I would not buy it again if I had the choice!"
5,ANOTHER MUST HAVE!,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!We have had no issues with this swing! We have used this with two of our children and we just love it!The music and the lights and the ability to change positions is FANTASTIC!
5,Best swing ever!,"Our baby loves this swing...If he gets bored of going front-to-back swinging, he enjoys going side-to-side. He loves to watch the fish and listen to the music. I would NOT buy any other swing! STOCK UP ON BATTERIES THOUGH!!!"
1,Poor quality & horrible customer service,"Tonight, my son fell out of his swing this afternoon when the seat tipped over. The bolts were not loose, nor were they stripped. The CSR that I spoke to at Mattel basically told me that it was my fault (in a nutshell) and told me to buy a new one. She said that they no longer make the repair parts for this particular swing. PLEASE check your Fisher Price swings and make sure the seat is not loose. Also, double check the seat belts. Because those came loose as well.This was a secondhand gift, however, I would expect expensive baby items like this SHOULD last more than a few years and through more than one child.In terms of this swing, the motor makes a very loud noise and is sucks batteries like no tomorrow. The seat is wobbly and not safe. My son fell out of this swing face first onto the floor tonight and has a huge bruise on his head from it. FP refused to do anything about it, they didn't even apologize.I give this ZERO stars."
4,got alot of use!,"i have the older version and i used this swing alot with my son! he loved sleeping in it and just sitting and playing. he really liked the dome on the top that lights up. i didn't give it 5 stars for a few reasons: i often had to adjust the legs to just the right spots so it was balenced right, it would sometimes make loud poping like noises, batteries go fast as with most child items, and sometimes the swing controls would act weird like not turning off/on but when you tried it again it was fine."
5,Love it! Love it! Love it! My son does too!!!,"This swing has been my saving grace! God must have put a little work into this swing to help all those babies out there that needed a little extra soothing. My son's acid reflux started at 2 weeks old...ooooooh talk about a crying, upset baby. This swing has really helped us all out. He loves the side to side motion and he loves all the different soothing noises that it makes (waves especially). He is now 4 months old and although we have a much better handle on his reflux, he still loves this swing. He will sit in it for hours and talk a up a storm. Whenever he gets tired and starts to get a little cranky, I put him in the swing on high, start the waves and little man is in dreamland! Thank you Fisher Price...for all of your Ocean Wonders products!"
4,Great Purchase,"Assembly was easy although tray piece was broken when product arrived (I still have not figured out how to return item or contact someone at Amazon). Swing has lots of options, music is great, mobile is great and adjustable seat is very padded. The swing does teeter a bit if legs are not spaced apart. Overall great purchase."
5,A Must Have !!!,"I never write reviews, but wanted other new moms to know what a life saver this swing has been. I had heard from about 4 of my girlfriends with babies that this swing was a must. Boy were they right! My 3 week old son loves it. It gives you time to get some things done and they just fall asleep. Hes a little too young to be able to follow the mobile, but he loves to stare at the fishes. He loves the side to side motion. I would recommend this swing to everyone."
5,"MAURA O'CONNELL: A VOICE WITH ""IT""!","I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM FOR THE UNIQUE TRIBUTE TO IRELAND SUNG BY MAURA O'CONNELL AND WAS CHARMED BY HER VOICE THROUGHOUT. IT HAS THAT ""IT"" QUALITY THAT GREAT SINGERS HAVE, A UNIQUE SOMETHING YOU CAN'T QUITE PUT YOUR FINGER ON, BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HEAR IT, A ""CATCHINESS"" OF A KIND THAT YOU HEAR WHEN YOU LISTEN TO WOMEN SINGERS FROM ELLA FITZGERALD AND PEGGY LEE TO JANIS JOPLIN AND BONNIE RIATT. SMALL WONDER THAT MAURA O'CONNELL IS NOMINATED FOR A GRAMMY THIS YEAR!!!"
3,It works but....,"I got this lens about year ago and use it on my A100.It is a cheap lens and the image is also cheap. In the wide end you need to stopped down to ~f6.3 or your image will be soft in the corner. In the tele end, even you stopped down to f11, the image still looks very soft even in the center, not mention it will defocus near the corner, too. The other problem of this lens is its weight. It is a huge and heavy lens. So if you want to bring it as the second lens, it will take a lot of space in your bag...Overall, If you only have $100 budget for the lens, and want to have a wide to tele lens. It is the one you can have. If you care and want to have a sharp picture. Save your money and fine something else."
1,It has interior scratches that blurr images,I noticed that my photos had common spots on all of my photos in the same areas. I inspected my lens to see if for some reason I had any visible scratches on the exterior lens filter or the lens. It turn out to be that it had some interior scratches or bubbles inside the lens. I would like a exchange or get my money back.
1,...,im taking physics 2 now. took 1 last semester. used serway for both classes. its absolutely horrible. they go over in the text 1/10 of the stuff they ask you questions about at the end of each chapter. there are virtually NO significant worked out problems (they leave that to you to do) and sometimes they leave entire equations out because of printing mistakes. its absolutely horrible...
2,Frustrating Book,This is my first experience with this author/book and I am not impressed. I have used other physics books in the past that were far better than this one. There are not too many worked out example problems and the level of understanding in the book is set pretty high.
1,Suffering Physics Student,"I have suffered through two semesters of study with Serway texts. The explanation of electric potential energy, potential difference and voltage was tortured, convoluated and nearly unintelligible. Our instructor mercifully supplied his own summary of the topic. Also miserable, was the book's presentation of the magnetic torque on a current loop. The diagrams were so confusing, I had to throw up my hands. Lastly, but definitely not the least infuriating, was Serway's use of a term in the middle of the text without a previous definition or explanation. He does this with ""focal length"" in his section on geometric optics. I had to buy alternative physics texts, at some expense, just to get through the semesters. Thank goodness the courses, otherwise, interesting and useful, are over."
4,Pretty good,"It is pretty good, and serves well as a protector for my lens. Doesn't distort pictures, and the price is quite reasonable."
3,As expected,Exactly what I expected it to be. I needed the book to reference for my job. JCL and I go way back.
5,ATMOSPHERIC ANGELO AND LYNCH !!!,"Twin Peaks. The most amazing TV program ever was built with an original and loving soundtrack composed by Angelo and Lynch with help from amazing singer, Julee Cruise. Some of my favourite Musical pieces are on this CD. Please, don't hesitate. If you loved the TV show, the album is all you need to listen to. So you can enter your own strange wonderous world of the Lodge...."
5,"Fantastic music, perfectly suited for the show- very funky!","This album will strike many people as being full of strange, moody, slightly spooky music. They're right, because that's the type of show it was written for.Nonetheless, the music probably has wider appeal than the show did- David Lynch is kind of a weird dude. But the music is an album that you'll want to listen to over and over from time to time.If you're at all into fun funky stuff, or like jazz, or just want something evocative to listen to, buy this album!Paul"
5,True to its source: Haunting and strange,"Twin Peaks, an example of television at its most provacative, is amply served by this intriguing soundtrack. The haunting, jazz inflections of Angelo Baldamenti's melodies, are quite a match for the offbeat nature of this series and they stand alone well as examples of a type of music that is reminiscent of things past, but at the same moment, timeless. Julie Cruise's voice blends into this slow tranquil mix as well as any vocalist could; and the cryptic lyrics also reflect the nature of the show. Very few TV shows have soundtracks worth having; this one is probably the best of them all."
3,Not a good representation of all the music,"I LOVE Twin Peaks, but there are so many songs missing from this soundtrack, that it upsets me. Why do I need to hear 3 different orchestrations of Audrey's theme? And why are both Rock Back Inside My Heart and As The World Spins are left out? These songs are, in my opinion, two of the best songs from the series. I still listen to this cd a lot, but when it gets time for the last 3 songs (All previously represented on the cd), it's a rare time when I do not end my listening session right there."
3,Dual heights,"3 1/2Though sandwiched with a little too much finger-snapping detective repetition, esoteric ambiance bookends what would become one of modern sight and sound's most thrilling couples."
4,Self-conscious schmaltz--done right,It's OK to love schmaltz. Especially if it's self-conscious schmaltz. And if you're going to be alternately cloying and derivitive then you better be fun at the same time. And a quirky TV show sound track is the best place to do it. 3 cheers and 3 cheers more for Angelo Badalamenti.
5,how wonderful to relive this incredible piece of music...,"how wonderful to relive this incredible piece of haunting and suspenseful music created for this series..what a gem!!!!!so moving as if you were really there again!!........thinking again, ""who killed Laura Palmer?""...Twin Peaks: All New Season Two Music"
3,Too small,This item is a waste of your money. I'd suggest you purchase something with a little more power and large grip...
1,contradictory description,B&D; Mouse. At the top of the page this tool is described as 5 AMP so it should be up to heavy duty work. One review said it is not for heavy duty work.Later on in the product description the tool is described as 0.5 AMP not something you would want for continuous and heavy duty work.I wonder which description is correct? 5 AMPS or 0.5 AMPS.
3,Accessories tough to find,"I bought this to refinish/finish some furniture that I am working on. It works fairly well for light duty sanding. The main problem I ran into was trying to find the sandpaper/accessories I needed. Black & Decker doesn't make low grit sandpapers, so you have to buy 3rd party. Not always easy to find. The other problem I had was trying to find replacement steel wool pads. None of the hardware/megastores in my town have them. If I had to do this over again, I would probably purchase sander that used standard sandpaper sheets.Update: I have recently found more third-party sheets that work with this sander. That may bump the rating to 3.5 or 4. I still can't find replacement steel wool sheets, so no 5 stars."
5,Sandman,This is what I should have bought first instead of the Mega-Mouse. I'll probably never use my Mega-Mouse again. Bigger is not always better.
4,Easy to use and versatile,"As age creeps up on us, we tend to look for easier less difficult ways to do the jobs we once took no notice of. This product allows me to do that."
1,junk,"Please, be smarter than me...don't buy this sander. It will die on you after only a limited amount of use. the ""Mouse"" will start varying speeds up and down, and finally it just stops..I was dumb enough to buy two...don't make the same mistake I did, find another brand and purchase it."
3,An ok sander.,"I have one of these for sanding corners and smaller work pieces. It works ok, but mine vibrates more than I would like. Until something better comes along, I would buy another."
2,Worked well before it puked,"I used this to refinish a dining room set. Worked decent until after I finished the chairs the thing broke. 3 thin plastic pieces hold the sander to the body and they won't hold up to extended use. I wasn't rough with this thing either.-Don't buy the name brand sanding pads. They don't last and fail quickly all around the removable diamond and are more expensive. 1 sheets work just fine.-The detail sanding pieces are a good idea, but these fail pretty quickly as the plastic velcro melts off rendering them useless (the sandpaper stays stationary because the pieces won't grip) This is after about 10 min of use.Gel pads don't really add anything but price.Have to get another sander to finish. Too pricey for what you get. If you're looking to do a lot of sanding than invest in a more durable sander."
2,Some nice features but.................,"Purchased this product for an occasional odd job. Worked fine for a few months but then the on/off switch failed. Returned it and got another one but after only several uses, experienced the same problem. Unfortunately, it's out of warrantee. The quality is not there!!"
3,1/2 Amp not 5 Amps - Big Difference!,This detail sander is rated at .5 Amps by Black and Decker and not 5 Amps as numerous reviewers have mistakenly stated. I wish it were 5 Amps.
5,Great music,The smooth trumpet from Jonah Jones is honey for your nerves. Sit down and listen. Only too bad that no record company have send more CD's on the market with this wonderful artist
5,"Inspiring, and interesting","Although I am one of the people interviewed in the book, reading about all the other people interviewed, and how they contribute to society, really inspires me.I enjoy helping others to do more with their life, and I think this book really gets that message across. This book helped me to realize that there are others who like to help inspire."
5,Too Cute!,I searched high and low for a really cool skull lunch sack and I finally found it! I get compliments on this all the time.
4,Brutal Metal From CANADA?????,"Canada is known around the hard rock scene for bands like nickelback and default, not this. I guess THREAT SIGNAL can prove everybody wrong about Canada. This is brutally melodic metal people, and this band is very talented. Their sound is kinda a mixture of SOILWORK,IN FLAMES, with a little FEAR FACTORY thrown in for good measure. These guys also throw in some amazing solos that just add to the greatness of their music. SOLOS ARE NOT EVIL PEOPLE!!!!!!!!! Sorry, I just get tired of people bashing the fine art of soloing. Anyways, this is a great album and if you are a fan of the bands I mentioned, definately check this one out. These guys have the chance to take metal in a new direction along with the other young guns out there, but they need our support. Buy the album people, you won't be sorry."
5,Journey to the Heart of the Cabala,This book/deck set is one of the best I have ever used. The artist/author uses both Jungian psychology and symbolism to help guide the reader on a spiritual journey. I have used this book/deck set often and found it to be most useful in helping clients understand their lives more deeply. The paintings are also very beautiful. Each card is rich with symbolism that helps to support the message that the card delivers. I highly recommend this book/deck set to anyone interested in a more esoteric Tarot based on the Hermetic Cabala.
4,Julia is a true Tarot Master,"The tarot deck I purchased first, the book came out later. I have been a tarot reader for many years, and while the non traditional decks (such as this one) creat an opportunity for a more intuitiver reading, at that time I will admit I wasn't too geared for that. However, that has changed over the years, I have become more and more interested in Kabballa and it's symbolism in conjunction to tarot is obvious. julia with her unique artwork got me interested (for the first time) in the kabballa, and it's cornerstone to the systems of magick I have explored have made this a must have.The book shows you the artists interpretation of the Major arcana, the court cards, the pips and how on the tree of life they relate to each of us and to each other.While I don't think I would recommend this if you are just learning tarot, I have to say that it is a necesssary addition to any serious tarot practioner's collection."
4,High Quality Material,Great quality. Easy to work with and easy to cut. I also cleans fairly easy. The paint shows clear without smearing.
5,"It's good, BUT Lodge is better","This is a GOOD pan, which is why I gave it 5 stars. It serves its purpose not only to make crisp, hot pizza, but also to cook or reheat just about anything in the oven. Not only that, it doubles as a large griddle, either on the stovetop, or on the BBQ grill.However, I also own the Lodge pizza pan, which does cost more, and I find that pizza pan to be overall better quality.If you don't want to spend as much, then this pan is a GOOD pan, and serves its purpose. But if you don't mind spending a little more for a better quality pan, then go with Lodge."
4,"Nice even heat, nice iron, slow heatup time!","Another great piece of cast iron cookware, this pizza pan is really great. Its just deep enough to make it great for a thicker crust pizza and its wide enough to give you big slices if you want 'em. It heats really evenly and I've found that with a little seasoning in the oven, is really nonstick compared to some other pizza pans I've used. The only downside is that it takes a little longer to heat-up the pan, so the top of your pizza is going to cook faster than the bottom. This can be re-mediated by either warming the pan up in the over slightly, then transferring the pizza on, or just letting what will be, be. I love this pan, and you will too!"
4,Seems to be good quality but hard to be sure,"Nice, heavy, quality pan. However, I didn't realize it was made in China, and this made me really concerned about the quality of the seasoning (who know what they used to pre-season it). The box looked really cheesy and cheap and had a typo right on it (unlike my Lodge cast iron, which was impressive in every way). The Sante website is pretty vague as well. I did call the company to inquire about the seasoning and they seemed to have good customer service and assured me that it was a vegetable oil based seasoning. Overall I think this pan is adequate and produced a nice pizza crust, but I would recommend another American-made brand first like Lodge."
1,Paint Coming Off of Pan,There is black paint coming off of the handles and when I oil the pan there is black coming off onto the paper towel. It doesn't seem right that paint should be chipping off of cast iron. It doesn't seem safe to cook in. I think i will return this pan.
1,Don't even THINK about it!!,"Wow, I don't think that I have ever been this disappointed by a mail order item before. The case is really poorly constructed. It is two thick pieces of plastic. I couldn't get the two parts to stay together. It is really was low-rent compared to the very nice iPod itself. It reminded me more like product packaging than an actual product. This probably costs $1 to manufacture. I bought a lovely iSkin at a local Apple store. Which is an excellent alternative."
4,Almost perfect,"First off I hate soft cases, so when I saw this I was overjoyed. Unfortunately I procrastinated in buy this case and my mini got a giant scratch on the screen. Determined to not let this happen again i bought a liquid scratch repair kit, which did absolutely nothing, and this case which has been great in protecting my ipod. I can get it on and off very easily and I have gotten many comments about how cool it looks. Unfortunately this case scratches like nothing else. After only keeping this in my pocket for about a week the entire thing is scratched, but I guess it's better than having my mini scratched. So overall it is a great case, which I will never regret buying."
3,jUST GOOD LOOKING!,"the thing with this case its that doenst cover the wheel.. so,, its gets very very dirty,., BLACK!!!. and besides its very hard,. and if it falls, the case broke.. so.. i think its only the looking.. but..its ok.. just for a month!! because besides your ipod gets very heavy and thick and gets a little incomfortable!... its better the one with rubber.. or the whole case like a cell phone.."
2,Impossible to remove,This thing is impossible to remove. Debris has since worked it's way in between the screen and the mini and is a thousand times worse than a scratch.
4,"Best case i've had, tight fit","Just got this item about 15 minutes ago. I have to agree with everyone else in that there is an extremely tight fit, but it's worth it. Seems like it will protect it very well. Kind of got stuck when I first tried putting it on, but I got it. I had the jam jacket soft case for my ipod before this one, and that was horrible. I've had many cases, and I don't reccommend soft cases to anyone."
3,Sets off security alarms,"I thought this product was absolutely fantastic until I started setting off store alarms as I entered or exited a store. It's a really strange phenomenon but the plastic case seems to trigger something with some store alarms. I tested the theory many, many times. I'd walk through with the case on the iPod mini, with it next to the iPod mini, and in opposite hands--and the alarms would go off. The next day I'd walk through the same stores, leaving the case at home and I would be fine.Strangest thing. It's a good case, easy to remove, keeps the iPod protected, but a big pain if you want to walk in stores with it."
1,Please do NOT purchase,"I purchased the case before reading the reviews which was a mistake. The negative reviews of the case being extrememly difficult to remove were very true. Also most importantly, this case SCRATCHES your ipod mini. In order to put the case on, the plastic case rubs against my ipod and scratched my brand new ipod mini. Removing also added more scratches. Lastly, particles can get stuck between the case and the screen and scratch the screen especially upon removal."
1,Scratches your mini,I got this about two monthes ago. It was alright for the first few weeks but after that dirt started to get stuck to the case and wouldn't come off. When i would put the case on my ipod it would just put the dirt into the screen and won't come out. It also does the same for the metal part too. I would only put it in the case whenever I would use it besides that it was off.
2,Disappointed,"This cover is very stylish and is light. However, they said it would fit with most of the common ipod accessories, but when I tried to dock my mini into its dock, it would not fit. It is a huge hastle to keep taking the cover on and off. Also, the cover easily gets scratched when taking it off the ipod. Since the cover is clear plastic, you can see all the scratches, especially the scratches over the ipod screen. This gets very annoying. Overall, not a very good cover for protecting your ipod."
1,Please... Avoid This Item...,"To start this off... THIS IS THE WORST BUY OF MY ENTIRE LIFE! I've bought this all right.. My first mistake. It's horrible. The case get slippery and sticky if you hold it too long, it scrathes so so easily, plus, it hurts your ipod itself! Mine all torn and scratcheds up cause of this piece of crap. I'd rate it a 0 if I could. It's horrible. The click wheel is messed up. I avoid hard cases now. Try and find soft cases. Nothing's good about this. The click wheel doesn't work properly anymore. since there's a tight opening, the whole click wheel is black and it's outlined in white! (Outlined in white because part of the click wheel is on the inside.) Adding all of this up...Pros: Nothing at all.Cons: Every single little thing.Don't think I'm negative. Don't say this other guy said it sucked, he's an idiot. I actually bought the product ok? I'm not lying. If you don't believe me... Buy it. You'll find out."
3,Improvements welcome,"This book was a disappointment. He begins by stating that women had a controlling role in the domestication of man, a politically correct notion that belies the fact that women were treated as property for most of history. Durant also uses a lot of filler. He quotes at length from ancient texts, poetry and the bible. We can find these sources if we have a desire to read them. What we want from him is his interpretation. The book would be shorter but more readable if these passages were removed."
5,History as a sumptuous dessert.,"This highly readable book of history is a group of essays written by renowned historian Will Durant. This book is more than a synopsis of his earlier, well-known series written with his wife Ariel.This makes excellent reading for the would-be history-buff or for someone who wants to understand how the human race has gotten to the point it's at today.I cannot emphasize enough how easy-to-read this text is and, yet, the details that bring history alive have not been boiled down into pablum."
4,This book was a little light but fun,"I enjoyed this book but I'm only giving it 4 stars because I felt that it lacked any kind of depth of at all. SO if you haven't read much history this book is really good, but if you've read more in depth books then this book will seem a bit thin."
5,Advice you can put to use!,"""Following Through: a Revolutionary New Model For Finishing Whatever You Start"" is filled with extraordinary information that can be used every day. Helped me understand how to motivate myself to achieve my goals and get things done. Interesting insight to what motivates people!"
5,One of the most useful books I have read,"The authors are so smart, because they are dealing pragmatically with how humans really do things, not just how we intend to do them. And they provide a large compendium of practical suggestions to help guide our primitive instincts towards the intentions set by our better nature.I have ready many self-help books, and this is perhaps the most practical one I have ever seen. It should be a best-seller, and it should revolutionize the way people think about putting intention into action. It is brilliant."
3,"An interesting, yet shallow book!","This book is extremely interesting in the format that it presents its theories on human behavior. However, when it came to developing the skills necessary to implement its program on ""following through,"" I found it to be shallow and lacking concrete ways to implement its program. I have given it three stars, because althought it provides interesting cases on how the system has worked, when you deeply analyze the program you realize that it is impractical, specialy if you want to find the core reasons of your behavior."
1,Readable and forgettable.,"I ordered the book since one of the authors was interviewed in the NY Times. He sounded interesting.I found the book had a few uplifting anecdotes. It promised techniques: One of the featured techniques involved buying a recommended product, the MotivAider, the $48.95 gizmo which appears on ""the customers who bought this item also bought this"" row below the book on Amazon. I cut my losses, perhaps someone had a great increase in personal productivity with the MotivAider; a vibrating reminder is not for me. I will not go on; I've got things to do."
1,Simplistic mumbo jumbo!,"This book which is based on incredibly suspicious evolutionary theory is simplistic and outlandish. The authors make a big deal out of saying that we have two forces warring against each other with one side wanting short-term pleasure and the other wanting long-term benefits. Well, duh! We all already know that. This warring is supposed to occur because we have not completely evolved out of our ""primitve guidance systems"" (PGS for short)! Their solution to this evolutionary flaw is even worse -- create enrironments of critical situations that force you to act. Haven't we all been trying to bully ourselves into doing what we need to do for long enough? These authors now want us to invite others to do it for us!I would highly recommend a book called The Now Habit by Neal Fiore if you really want to know why you procrastinate. Read that book first and I'm sure you'll agree it's the only one you'll need."
1,I never finished the book,I got about halfway through this book. What I read was fairly mundane and prosaic. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know.
4,"A solid book, but not magic","If you are pretty good at following through already, then you are probably using many of the suggestions in this book without realizing it. If you have follow through problems, then this is probably a useful investment. The authors do a very good job of communicating their message clearly with many examples. I would say the book could be summarized by two messages: (1) Each of us has a conflict between our short term desires and long term goals. We would prefer to eat that donut now and yet we worry about the heart attack we might get in 20 years. (2) To resolve these conflicts and achieve our goals, we need to alter our environment (in creative ways) so our desires and goals are aligned. The first message is important because it provides a useful way to understand our failings without piling on a lot of regrets. The second message provides the tools to achieve our goals."
2,Guinea Pigs by Playmobile,I was unhappy that the item was so teeny. Small parts that could be swallowed. But I was satisfied when the company (Growing Tree) returned my money because I was not happy with it. So in the end I give the company 5 stars but the product 2.
5,Great second album Mr Glasper,"Managed to catch a review for this album recently on michaelvalentinestudio site and thought it would be a good chance buy. I was right. Took a little getting used too, but knew it would grow on me. Great pianist and composer with a bouncy feel to his stride. Almost Herbie Hancockish in places I thought. Great sublime vocals by Bilal and wonderful inclusion of his mother's voice on the last track."
4,Trojan 7 review.,"This books doesn't exactly follow the pattern of the previous ones, and is not what you expected to read. The writer delays the main character experiences as to extending the chain of books on the topic. Yet the book pulls your attention to the end, and includes a ""soap opera"" part with the beautiful romantic part of the weird, but normal feeling that both ""time-travelers"" experience with the sister of Jesus, Rachel.The last chapter was the one that I like the most, very spiritual, reveals the spiritual bias (beliefs) of the writer.It's a wonderful chapter, though, in this series, and opens your apetite for more."
4,Caballo de Troya 7 (Nahum) (Caballode Troya),"The book is interesting. A must if you have been reading the previous volumes ( 1 to 6). Not as good as the first one, but still, it is giving a lot of interesting facts (if you believe on it) about the unknown life of Jesus. I try to skip the foot notes, because, even if they give me a lot of information, most of the times it has nothing to do with the core issue. As a whole, I consider the book a good purchase."
5,Baby Blanket Sunscreen,This sunscreen works great!!! I used it all last summer and my daughter did not burn once. She has sensitive skin and it is very gentle and rubs in so it doesn't look white.
1,Seems like a knockoff,I returned this instantly after comparing it to my other Hoya filter of the exact same kind. The coating was a different color and the labeling was different.
1,Run Away!,"After ordering a new 52mm Hoya filter, I was quite surprised to receive a 72 mm Tiffen filter attached to a broken Hoya case with a rubber band. The Tiffen filter was too big and did not come close to fitting in the Hoya case (hence the rubber band I suppose). After taking some terrific pictures of this atrocity with my DSLR using an unfiltered lens, I returned it to Amazon for a refund. I told the guy at Amazon that it would be cheaper for me to toss it in the trash for him but if he wanted it back, he could have it! My only praise is that Amazon did refund my money without a problem but this was beyond ridiculous. You are better off buying a cheap filter at your local Best Buy than to even consider purchasing something from ""eDirectPhoto Inc."" I generally have a great experience at Amazon but this was a big disappointment."
4,Good filter,I got this mainly as a lens protector and am pleased with the quality. No glare with this filter.
4,Awesome filter,Probably one of my best filters. I bought this for my Tamron 55-200mm lens and it fits perfectly. This is a lot better than the 1-10 filters.
4,Works...,I bought these to compliment a nikon d3100 18-55 and 55-200 camera kit. they seem to do a decent job protecting the lens but are a little difficult to clean. Overall I'd say they are are a good value compared to what you would find at a big box retailer.
5,"Does what it promises, I am happy","Hoya Multi Coated filters are renowned for their manufacturing excellence and great quality glass. This is a slim filter that can help protect my 50mm F1.8 lens. The front thread will also help me to attach more glass on top of the filter. I am happy with the filter and overall shopping experience. Do remember, ""multi-coated"" are better optics, than normal ones, and you may consider this or better to do justice to the sharpest 50 mm F1.8 or F1.4 or F 1.2 lens you have."
5,"Protects my lens, clear with no artifacts","I bought this to protect my lens from my clumsy hands. I've put many fingerprints on it, thinking I had my lens cap on when I didn't... so I figure it's been a good investment so far. I'm no expert, but I don't see any weird lighting effects or colorations, so I assume it's not affecting my picture quality.I have a Nikon D40 with the stock 18-55 lens."
5,Transformational insights relayed through women's stories,The Authors provide a forum for the telling of individual hispanic women's stories about aspects of theological principles which cut across the various U.S. Latino populations.These women's stories provide transformational insights regarding: the feminine face of God:liberation vs equality in relationships;and leadership styles driven by the common good rather than individual gain.
2,"If you order full sheets, MEASURE THEM WHEN THEY ARRIVE","I have had the same weird problem with two sets of this and and one of another model of Pinzon sheets. The package and both sheets are all labeled ""full"" but are really ""queen"" size--much too big for a double bed.Measure yours when they arrive and return them as defective. (Amazon is pretty good about that.)I think what may be happening is that, like many manufacturers, Pinzon is just not making full sheets any more. Unlike others, they are sticking ""full"" labels on queen size sheets and passing them off.Otherwise, these seem to be of acceptable quality. The fabric is thinner than I would like, but would appear to be sturdy enough. If only I could use them. (I'm waiting to hear from Amazon if I'm ever going to get a set I can use.)"
4,"Decent sheets, unbeatable price","These organic sheets are cheaper than most non-organic sheets, which is why I bought them. The fabric is very decent, certainly not high-end luxury sheets, but just below it in terms of softness (certainly not the rougher sheets my penny-pinching family used to buy when I was a kid or the incredibly rough, scratchy sheets of institutions). The only not-as-high-quality attribute is the stitching. It holds fine, so no problems there. But it is very plain stitching, not the slightly nicer stitching you find on most high quality sheets. Since they're organic I guess they had to save money somewhere, and it doesn't bother me one bit! But for someone who likes their bed to look really nice, they might be disappointed."
4,"INITIALLY disappointing, but now I love them","I ordered these sheets to give as a present but after they arrived I realized that they would make a poor gift. The packaging was awful and made the set look like I bought it at a dollar store. It didn't say organic anywhere on the outside, nor did it state the thread count. A tag on the sheet said organic, but . . . the whole packaging thing made me feel less than secure about that.I kept the sheets myself and found them to be reasonably comfortable but kind of ugly and not at all fun. I wouldn't buy them again.THREE YEARS LATER: I don't know if they still have the packaging problem that makes these sheets a poor gift option, but now that I have been sleeping on them for 3 years, I have to say that they are wonderful sheets!!! Very soft and reasonably durable. I'm going to have to change them from two stars to four -- the product would be a five, but the packaging was really bad."
1,Bimbos wallow in mudd and so does the director,This film is a complete ripoff of DECENT. Not a good rip-off either. It contains some of the worst dialogue ever put on film. Kind of scary that films like this continue to get released to the viewing public. zero stars if there was an option.
5,Wow what talent,"I bought this dvd because after watching them on the Gaither family video,wow can they sing. I have seen so much talent watching Bill dvd,s. The Hoppers can belt out a song better than anyone I have heard. They are a family that,s been with the Gaithers forever. They have fun and a lot of joy performing together.I love the way Bill did this dvd,its from several different home coming reuinion gatherings. Good viewing ..."
3,irritated,"My favorite group has spoiled this wonderful collection by the addition of a very silly Jingle Bells, which would be inappropriate at a regular rhythm but absolutely inane at the rapid speed, which is supposed to be amusing I guess, but I find irritating. Shame on you."
5,Great Cap and that will certainly keep your head warm.,Great product well worth the buy. Don't wear it in the summer though. You head will bake. Great in the cooler months for keeping your head warm.
2,Such is Quality from Pakistan,"I don't know what ""leather"" is in Pakistan, but the quality was so-so. The fabric that created the purple flames was stain on the one I received. But it was $2.99. Shipping was more than the product.I guess I'll live.I wouldn't buy their stuff again."
2,Plastic flame insert means I won't wear it,"I don't see how I can wear this under my helmet. My helmet doesn't fit particularly tight, but the plastic flame insert are like sew on embroidery patches you'd put on a shirt, so it take up a lot of room. Plus, I ordered blue flame - it came in yellow. For you lucky no-helmet law residents, it might be all right in the winter, but I agree with another reviewer you can't wear this in the summer - too plastic and thick."
2,Poor taste compared to other premium dark chocolate,"I was disappointed with the taste of the chocolate. For it's price, I was expecting more. Spend a few extra dollars and go for the higher grade cacao brands."
2,Eww! Save Your Money,"Bought these from K-Mart because I wanted them for my new office. After replacing my Zenith 5"" two-way speakers, these were not any better; I was disappointed. Having worked in electronics retail in the past, KLH used to be pretty good. Not so anymore. The construction quality of these is poor. I listened to classic rock, easy listening, & guitar.....all of which sounded 'hollow' from these speakers; like the singer was singing into a tube. Save your money & get JBL or Sony for the same price range. If you must have these, get them on the internet somewhere else for cheaper. For me, I'm going back to JBL."
4,Beautifully designed but pre-seasoning is faulty,"I asked for this four-quart dutch oven for Christmas because I wanted it for no-knead bread baking. I chose this pot because of its handsome design, and I am pleased with its looks and its ease of use: it is nicely proportioned, with an indentation for the lid handle and large easily-grabbed side handles. The interior is smoothly sloped. I was not pleased with the quality of the pre-seasoning; like other buyers, I needed to thoroughly scrub off the residues and re-season the pot and lid. Having done that, I am happy to have this pot for bread baking. My bread does not stick at all to the pot, and I can just wipe it out with an oiled paper towel to clean it. The surface both inside and out is a bit rough, but it seems to work fine. I prefer plain cast iron to enameled cast iron because I need not worry about scratching or chipping it. The pot should last forever, improving as it is used."
4,"I would buy it again, but","First, this a great piece of kitchen equipment to have. I love cast iron, and will buy more from this company. But the inside of this pot is a little rough and I think I might sand it down. The preseasoning seemed fine to me. I baked a dutch baby in it this morning and it came right out, no sticking whatsoever. I love the way it looks, with the curved handles. I also think these are better than the enameled versions, which always chip. This is a big dutch oven, big enough for a whole chicken I think."
4,Almost awesome,"Memo from Turner is one the best Stones song ever. Mots of the other songs are great, but some are just weird synthesizer-type sounds. The best parts, though, are second to none"
2,Crummy comes to mind,"I'm not a contractor but I am an intermediate level DIY'er. I tend to use a cordless screwdriver in most things I do. For some tools, I don't spend the money for the top of the line stuff. In most cases, that is OK. But in this case, the screwdriver let me down. After only two months of light use, it started to fall apart around the neck of the screwdriver where you adjust the torque. The case started to split too and I could see the plastic gears, cheap stuff. The battery life was OK for what I used it for. I think I'll try the Dewalt 920."
2,Deceptively small,"I order this, figuring it would be large enough for a couple of steaks, chops, or paninis. Though this is a 10 inch pan, the actual grill area is only big enough for one moderate sized sandwich.Also, the seasoning doesn't seem as good. The 12 inch skillet I bought was well seasoned and deep black (I wish Lodge made a round Pro Logic grill this size). This pan is very ashy, though I am sure it will season up after some use."
1,If you like broken pans,The pan arrived broken in pieces. Must be pretty poor worknmanship in casting.
1,Bad Quality,"All Lodge cast iron pots and pans are TERRIBLE!!! Even pre-seasoned ones don`t have smooth surface, it`s all rough and uneven and food sticks no matter how hot the pan and oil get. After it sticks you have to clean them thorouhgly and seasoning comes off... then you have to season them all over again - almost each time. Cast iron MUST have smooth surface - and also it doesn`t have to be that heavy to be good. I used to have cast iron pans, and they were so much better - not that heavy and rough... Very bad quality!"
5,Ashamed,"Although this happened before I was born, it makes me ashamed to be ""WHITE"".Does the color of my skin make me any ""BETTER"" than thous that are not? NO! it does not."
3,a brief overview...,"A breif overview of how different ethnic groups approcah the Church and it's activities, but mostly focused on logistical concerns and not on worship style, faith, male vs. female perspectives, etc. within the different churches (ethnic groups). However, goo dfor group discussion."
3,Mixed Reviews,"This video is well done. But, on the other hand, I was ""very"" disappointed that the dances that were taught were not the same ones listed on the cover of the video. The dances taught were: Black Velvet, Wild Wild West, Tulsa, Kentucky Chug, Reggae Cowboy, and Tumble Weed (sometimes referred to as Rolling Bushes). Some of these dances are really more advanced."
2,line dance,"The steps are a little hard to follow, would be easier if you could see the back view as well. Thought there would be more than just a few dances on this video."
5,5 Stars for Clapton Fans,"This is probably Eric Clapton's best live set before he laid back into a more acoustic and bluesy mode. Recommended for great playing, and crackling energy. Part of the resurgence at this time was due to Eric Clapton's more commercial direction in the 80s and 90s - with Behind the Sun and Journeyman. Clapton's playing was always better live and this album captures a good cross section of his best work at the time. Every song works and gels well and establishes Eric as the rock / blues force he has always been. Absent are Layla, and Forever Man, etc - but you don't really miss them.I have always felt that Clapton became a little more subdued as he aged - although the recent Clapton / Winwood set is a nice return to form as well and worth getting."
3,"""Badge"" is terrible; so are most of the other songs","Some dissapointments I had with the CD was the OBVIOUS mediocre version of ""Badge""....""Badge"" is my favourite song, but the solo is BAD! Clapton goes for speed instead of passion...Go Back and listen to the ""Crossroads 2: Live in the '70s"" solo that's a WHOPPING 10 minutes long! CLAPTON WAS TRULY BETTER IN THE '70S!"
2,Plastic bag for a shipper??,"Of course the album (CD) is great, but the case is destroyed. How can you ship a jewel case in a plastic wrapper with no padding. I buy the physical product so I can present it. Pity."
5,24 NIGHTS 2-LP'S ERIC CLAPTON,THIS IS A LIVE PERFORMANCE RECORDING.UNBELIEVEABLE. THIS LP IS A RARE FIND.ESPECIALLY IN MINT CONDITION.IF YOU ARE A CLAPTON FAN THIS SHOULDN'T BE A DISAPPOINTMENT TO YOUR EARS.
5,quality,"There I was, at three in the morning in Sri Lanka, formerly known as Sri lAnka, I had to fill a brandy glass with a thousand brown m&m's or Ozzy wouldn't go on stage. Just then Jeff Beck poped his head round tha corner, and mentioned a little sweet shop on the edge of town. I arrived at the candy shop to find that it was guarded by a bloomin' bengal tiger. I disposed of the tiger alright me self, but the shopkeeper and his son were an entirely different story all together... I had to beat them to death with their own shoes. But we got the m$m's and Ozzy went on stage and did a great show."
4,AUA Course,"This is a great workbook besides the fact that I cannot find the reference book that goes hand and hand with it. If you want to learn Thai script and the alphabet this book is good, but like I said the referene book is a big part of it."
5,Miraculous testimony of a Holocaust survivor,"Each chapter illustrates the hand of God working powerfully through the remarkable life of Zvi, who boldly witnesses for Jesus the Messiah in the land of Israel. Zvi, a Holocaust survivor and veteran of 4 Israeli wars, is always ready with a reason for his faith and with clear answers to tough questions. The Best of Zvi is a wonderful tool for sharing the gospel with Jewish friends and acquaintances. Zvi ventures through all segments of society as a sheep among wolves to offer food for thought and truth for the souls of God's chosen people. Every page is an inspiration for the believer and an opportunity for the truth seeker."
2,HE WAS A ONE MAN BAND!!!!!,"The Songs on this cd show the scope of Wilbert Harrison's career. The ""Kansas City"" cut is the one that almost everyone is familiar with and is the original FURY recording. The rest of the cuts on this cd were taken from various other companies that Wilbert recorded for from 1960 thru 1972. The cuts that are not included are his FURY/FIRE and SSS International Cuts. If you're looking for the best WILBERT HARRISON package, this is not the one."
5,Wow...What a knife,Wow...What a knife. This is as fine a feeling knife as I've ever held. The edge is awesome. The balance is perfect and it cuts great. Quality. What more can you say.
5,Superb sharpness & balance.,"The new Wusthof edge technology really is sharper. I don't use Asian knives so I can't compare to those, but these are much sharper than all my other western style knives despite the fact that I regularly sharpen those and steel them before use. Also beautifully balanced. Truly precision instruments. I find this the perfect size... The 8"" is too big for many things and the 6"" a little small. These knives are measured in metric, really, so are often a bit off their stated English sizes-I find they trend a bit large.These are the first ones I grab from the drawer and they give me a lot of pleasure. What else is there to say about a knife?"
5,The perfect knife for every kitchen,"It was said that Wusthof and Henckels make the best knives and this couldn't have been a better testament to their quality. I'm amazed everyday how sharp it's edge is - at least my fingers are - and expect it to hold up just as long as I keep honing its sharpness.I admit I was afraid of the price but most people need to realize that when they buy items this high quality, they will buy items that will last them a lifetime. Please, don't be afraid of the price and get this knife if you want the best."
5,Beautifully balanced knife,"Extremely well-made, balanced knife. Makes kitchen chores so much easier! A great value! Would recommend it to any cook, whether novice or professional."
4,Quality Product,"I bought this about a month ago and couldn't be happier with it. It cuts through everything smoothly and balanced perfectly in my hand. I ended up buying a 3.5"" paring knife as well and a salmon slicer from Wusthof. Now I just need the homer to keep the edge straight. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."
5,Perfect knife,"Sharp, comfortable to hold and use, just the right size for me but I have rather small hands. I would recommend this knife as a basic must-have."
5,Love it!,"This knife is far superior to my Henkell International chef's knife that I've been using for years. It's very sharp, well weighted well crafted. I knew when I picked wusthof I wouldn't be disapointed."
3,Works well for occasional use,The plastic ridges on the drum ware out quickly. It lasted about 6 months grinding about 25 capsules/pills a week.
3,Not what I expected,"Before I bought this item, I was using a plastic baggie with a hammer to crush ten pills at a time for my horse. It was quick, but jagged pieces of pills would cut the baggie as you were hammering and medicine would be all over the countertop. Thus, I bought this little device. Although it takes a lot longer to crush the pills, there is no mess. My hand did cramp by the fifth pill and I was really annoyed by the tenth pill. However, the average user probably wouldn't crush ten pills for a dose.Overall, decent product if you only have to crush one or two pills. I would not recommend it for crushing an equine dose of medicine."
2,Joy was short lived,"This product is a good design made with poor material. When it was new it worked well. Much better than the ""container/crusher"" style crushers. It was an effortless joy to crush pills. After a few months, the crank broke off one day without warning. I drilled a hole through the spool and inserted a steel rod to crank with. That worked for awhile but then the grinding lugs eventually wore smooth. So it was totally worthless in less than a year. If this were made of a better material, it would last long enough to be worthwhile."
2,Not a good solution,"This pill crusher does not work well! Instead of crushing the pills into a powder, it shaves them into small chunks that have to be further crushed in a traditional pill crusher. What a waste of time."
2,NOT HOW I REMEMBERED THEM,"For their ""comeback"" album, there are only 2 original members. The original vocalist supposedly sings background vocals, but they make no impact.The classic Leatherwolf guitar sound is intact through most of the songs. The songwriting as a whole, however, is not up to par. Gone are the memorable harmonies and power background vocals that made this band so special with ""Leatherwolf"" and ""Street Ready"". The new vocalist sounds a little like Mark Slaughter, but with bad songs to sing.To be fair, I'm not sure this band even wants to embrace their past, but over-zelous record executives are quick to slap stickers on CDs such as this that get consumers to wax nostalgic about ""The Return of the Los Angeles Power-Metal Band"". Such a statement promises nothing, but hints at a lot.Without knowing the band's past, this is very passable power metal, but nothing special or different from the many bands out there right now."
2,Yet Another Version to Choose From of the Same Bad CD!,"This European version must be special, because it costs more than the other Euopean version for sale (but less than the Japanese version). It doesn't matter which one you buy, you'll be getting the same generic power metal that doesn't do the band justice. If you liked the original singer, you won't like this one. If you liked the bands power-background vocals, you'll find little to like here, as they have all but disappeared. If you have never heard of Leatherwolf before.......do you really want to pay an import price to experiment? Didn't think so."
2,Misleading title,"When I buy a DVD that suggests its contents are probably about walking and scenic areas, it is rather disappointing to find that at least half the filming has absolutely nothing to do with walking. I may as well have bought a series called Scenic Wonders of the World - but I can borrow those from my local library for free.It is also disappointing that the contents of the first disc list a walk thru the beautiful Tongariro National Park in New Zealand's North Island, but what you actually get is the Hollyford Track in the South Island, so not much attention to editorial detail there.I must say that the contents and filming of the real walks was very well done. It's just a pity there was so little of it. I had been really looking forward to some brisk armchair walking, and feel quite let down that I didn't get much exercise at all."
3,Some good and some not so good,The first several volumes were really good. You are taken through hikes through different areas of the world as advertised. The last several volumes are too touristy and go away from the walking themes. The video quality on the last several volumes also are not as good as the first volumes.
4,Depends on your situation,"I actually liked this book. If you have in mind building your own motorcycle and have never done it before, this book lets you know what you are going to have to think about. It's not going to tell you exactly everything you are going to do step by step because every custom bike is different. But it does put in order the things you need to do once you decide what you want.Maybe the other reviewers didn't realize that they would have to come up with their own ideas about what they wanted to end up with. This book is not about building a particular motorcycle, it is about building YOUR dream motorcycle, whatever style that may be.I recommend this book to anyone who is considering building a motorcycle, who hasn't done it before and who has a pretty good idea of what they want to end up with. It will help you get your stuff together."
1,Bad experience,"The Instrument arrived on time for the Holidays. However, we could play it out till the new school year. The F Key does not play properly. I contacted the vendor (Austin Bazaar) and they said the 30 day warranty had passed so they would not address it. I contacted Amazon and they pretty were unhelpful in resolving the problem. The instrument has a basic defect and is at a music shop getting repaired. Basically Buyer Beware!!! Very poor customer service all the way around."
3,"Love the deck, but don't use the book","Although I love the witches tarot deck and use it for all my readings, I do not necessarily agree with the explanations in the book. The descriptions of each card (meaning and reversed meaning) are actually way too brief to conduct a decent reading. Hence, I would recommend the deck if it feels right, but not the book for it's interpretation."
3,Understandable yet tacky...,"I've delt with the Merlin deck before, and the pictures were beautiful. However, the pictures in the Witches Tarot seem phoney and rushed, with no real creative insight. The book, however, makes the deck feesable, as well as the aces. If the artist had reached a midpoint between the aces and the rest of the deck, the pictures would be beautiful. The book is wonderfully informative in not only the Tarot, but as well as meditation and divination in other forms. I reccommend it if you can find it for under $30. (The shelf price is rediculous.)"
3,MVP,"Before you buy this game there are a few things you should know.1. The teams in this game are not real, ie St Louis Legends.2. The players in this game are made up.3. On season, you must enter a code to pick up where you left off.4. There is no stat keeping in this game.5. Roger Clemens is not a player in the game.6. You can ask for tips from the ""Rocket"" when you are in a jam.7. It is fairly easy to score as well as give up runs.Beyond these aspects, this game is relatively good, and enjoyable for all ages. This game was made for Super Nintendo, and a professor couldn't tell the two apart."
2,Very Funny In An Unintentional Way,"I understand from the jacket that the author is a very well educated and intelligent guy. However, the basic structure of the book is that he's an Anglo who gets on a bus in Mexico and rides it down through Central America to Nicaragua. All the while, and you get the feeling he's never been to Central America before, he gives the reader all sorts of political, geo-political and editorial opinions about how screwed up the Mexicans, Salvadorans and Nicaraguans are. The guy could have stayed in Washington or New York or wherever he was, and made the same pronouncements at the bar with his well-educated and intelligent co-workers, with the same level of emotional involvement. If somehow getting on a bus and riding a few thousand miles suddenly makes your opinion about a region credible and worthwhile, the author succeeded. I'm a little skeptical myself. The author comes across like a post-liberal Colonel Blimp more than anything else."
5,"If you haven't heard of him, change that now!","This is a superb album by one of the unknown greats of the N.Y. session scene. George Young is an entertaining and versitile saxophonist without the harshness of Sanborn, nor the eliteness of Brecker. (Both xcellent musicans, I add) He plays all saxes, as well as clarinet along with his partner in crime, Lew Del Gatto. Apart from Del Gatto, the rest of the band will probably be only known to hard core jazz enthusiats. They all play brilliantly. The final track, in which George talks at length about his career and the making of this album is an informative finale, and should be done more often."
5,Great extra reach,"Works great to reach sore pressure points without intervention by someone else. It would help if packaged with a manual, but was easy enough to find one on the web. Delivery was in two days, even though I chose standard shipping. My physical therapist recommended this item, after using one on me in therapy."
5,excellent therapy tool,"I'm a retired chiropractor and have used many types of trigger point tools and modalities. I highly recommend this one, and have ordered 4 for various family members, and of course, one for myself!"
3,Unclear Instructions,I had high hopes for this product -- and I still have them based on the reviews I read. But the accompanying information in the guide sent with the TheraCane was confusing.
3,Good tool for the money,"TheraCane Massager with FREE 14 Page Trigger Point Training-Owners ManualNot much to say, this is a good tool for the money. I have used it afterperforming an intense massage and it did help to relieve some body stress. You can you it while watching TV kinda like flossing :)"
2,Thera Cane a big disappointment,"I am very disappointed in Thera Cane. It did not meet with my expectations, and I would like to return it."
1,JUNK,"Poor instructions, no video, overpiced and it didn't help. If you have problems with neck, shoulder and back pain PLEASE do yourself a favor and get 8 STEPS TO A PAIN FREE BACK."
2,Theracane Use,"The theracane use from the pamphlet included was not effective. This brief bit of information did not tell me how to effectively use it.Fortunately, I ordered the CD instructions. This was useful even though it was not easy to remember each step after it finished playing.The theracane was recommended by a physical therapist which is why I purchased it. In retrospect I should have predicted how often I would really use this clumsy tool. The benefits are very slight and the PT told me it would take time to experience results. I guess I am impatient!"
1,Why all the great reviews?,I am very into massage equipment/supplies; I was excited about this purchase since I have chronic pain and deep knots. This contraption happens to be the worst tool I have ever used. I have actually had an increase in pain & knots since using it - I gave it a few tries to be fair. I am not overdoing it nor using it incorrectly either.
1,Wayyyyyyyyyyy over-priced!!!,I bought mine 15 years ago for 30 dollars. NO need to be selling this for 70 dollars!!! Shame on you!
5,Incredibly Helpful Device,"Been using the TheraCane for about 3-4 months and have had great results. From my monthly massages over the past many years I've learned where the muscle knots are and the techniques for muscle release. The TheraCane has allowed me to address issues in my back and neck that apparently only daily attention can solve. As you experiment with your own technique to release stiff muscle knots, you'll learn that just small adjustments to TheraCane placement on muscles yields increased results. Begin using it for 5-10 minutes per day on your main muscle issues and then spend longer on other body areas. Well worth the price."
5,Massage Yourself,This is probably the best thing that ever happened to me. I love that I can reach any spot I need to get to. And it works so well without applying too much pressure on my own. It will definitely cut my massage bill down.
4,It works.,It is effective. The shape allows you to get at all kinds of spots.Effective use does require more pressure than I expected.
2,Not impressed,not really impressed with this cane. I actually hurt myself using it. Makes a nice hanger ornament in my closet
5,great self massage tool,"Great product. The standard. Don't settle for anything less. And it shipped in a timely fashion, too. I have one at work and one at home."
5,It's a Thera Cane,"I've personally never used one, but my husband had been wanting one for a while, and we couldn't find them in any of our local pharmacies. When I ordered this he was very happy and uses it almost every day."
5,Everyone should have one. Great instructions and tutorials.,"Awesome product that I take with me everywhere. Gets most of the spots I need (of course a human would be ideal) and leaves me feeling great. Definitely recommend. Although I could do without the green color.If there was a tad more grip on the cane it'd be perfect, but still, works like a charm."
5,Well worth it!,This device is awesome. Wish I'd discovered these a lot sooner. Works really well for reaching those trigger points in the shoulders/upper back etc. Still learning where all it can be used but no regrets for having bought it.
4,"Nice, but not a good massage","My chiropractor recommended the Thera Cane for me as I have a problem spot on the back of my right shoulder. I've got it at work with me and use it as needed during the day. It certainly helps my trouble spot a good deal, though it's not as fun nor does it feel as good as a really good massage. I also am not a huge fan of the funky green color.Works great and helps ease my trouble spot, making it a good value for the price. It helps me space my massages out a bit more (in this economy, those get pricey)."
4,decreased pain,Very helpful in creating pressure points. Easy to use. I was given info about this product by my physical therapist. It really helps.
5,Therapist Recommended,"As a clinical massage therapist, I recommend this product to many of my clients. If used correctly, this is a great product that has helped many of my clients to find relief between their massage appointments. It allows them to get to a problem area before it escalates into something much bigger. Most massage therapists that I know own one of these tools personally for their own use."
5,6 stars,love it. Nuff said. if you dont think 40 dollars is worth it then your missing out on the greatest thing ever.
5,Love it!,The item arrived exactly as described and I am very happy with it. There's so many different ways to use it to massage your own back and shoulders!
3,Great solution for knots,"I think this is a good product for people with tension or knots in their upper back who live alone. I rub my own back throughout the day at work (I have a desk job) due to back pain. When I get home I use this several times a week to relieve that. It's not perfect in that it can be very awkward to rub it just how you want it. But the bottom line is that it reduces my pain somewhat and I'm really glad I have it for those bad days. Still, nothing can compare to a real massage from a pair of hands."
5,Thera Cane Massager,I purchased this product to help work out muscle knots that were unreachable in my back/shoulders. This is the greatest thing in the world and it has helped me recover from tension in my back. I love it! Fast shipping too and a good price.
5,Wonderful relief for fibro,This tool is wonderful for relieving that hard-to-reach back pain and tender spots that just drive you crazy when a fibro episode comes on. I thoroughly believe in this product!
4,Massage yourself,"I bought this for my husband because he was always trying to rub his own shoulder and back. I have arthritis in my hands, so I can't massage him very well, so the theracane enables him to massage his back and shoulder knots himself. He loves it!"
5,Getting rid of knots was never this easy,"This is so easy to use and comes with an instruction guide to position the cane for different trigger points on all parts of the body - even the feet. I first tried it at the physical therapist's office, but they were selling it for $50!"
5,Incredible device for frozen shoulder!,"This tool was recommended to me by my physical therapist, and it has worked wonders in freeing up the tissues, muscles and tendons in my shoulder and upper back. I use it in conjunction with the Frozen Shoulder Workbook, and will continue to use it for the rest of my life, even after my shoulder recovers."
3,Pretty handy tool,"I travel a lot and find this to be handy for ""getting the knots out"" when I can't get to my own massage therapist!"
4,really works!!,"I really love this the Thereacane! It seems so simple, yet somehow it manages to find every knot in my back!!"
5,Theracane a perfect choice,This is a superb tool for those in the profession or individuals who suffer from tight back muscles or knots that are hard to reach. Its design enables a user to reach nearly anyplace on their back easily and have the ability to apply preasure to remote spots effectively. Its very affordable and comes with a booklet that shares techniques with the user on how to maximize its application in massage technique.
4,"Good quality, Good price",Got this for my mom for Christmas and loved the bargain price! She loved the gift and has been using it quite a bit since receiving it.
5,Pleased,"I love this Thera Cane and would recommend it to anyone. It has saved me hundreds of dollars being able to reach the areas I couldn't and getting instant relief. Because I do a lot of work at my computer I get muscle spasms and would spend a lot of money for massage or Chiropractic care. Now I can get instant relief by using the Thera Cane. I can pinpoint the problem area, massage it using the Thera Cane and get instant relief.Sincerely,Bonnie HinaFranklin, NC"
3,Thera cane,So far it is still awkward to use and will take some practice to reach a therapeutic benefit. I am hopeful that it will become a useful tool in the quest to break up the knots in my neck and traps.
5,Amazing!,This is the best thing I have found to get those unreachable knots in my back. Its a small price to pay to be pain-free!
5,BEST INVESTMENT!!!,I bought the Theracane after my physical therapist told me about it to help with a bulging disc in my neck. I would have chronic pain if I hadn't gotten one. It's the best investment I have ever made. Everyone should own one!
5,Helped relieve my back/shoulder pain,"I've been suffering from back pain on and off for years now. The doctor I saw for my last bout after trying to lift my 120 pound dog after he stumbled and fell (he has neuropathy) recommended this cane. I read through the reviews and can also recommend the book ""The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook"" which really helped identify where I should concentrate using the cane. All I can say is I've been pain free now for over a month. And the size is perfect for travel. It went to Seoul and back on my last business trip."
3,Thera Cane,"This is a useful tool for getting the knots out of your back. I do not know how to use it to it's fullest, but for the purposes I use it, it works fine."
5,Great product from a great source!,Great item for your sore muscles! So glad I ordered it!! Amazon is wonderful! You won't be disappointed if you order this! Super!
4,No more sores muscles.,Used this product before and still works great. Hits all my sore knots especially after a workout. Would and have recommended this product to multiple of people.
4,Only thing better is a real massage,"For the money and in a pinch when you need a hard to reach knot got at, this is your ticket!"
3,good...but,"This thing is definitely effective. I bought it with the Trigger Point therapy book others suggested here. I haven't read it yet, but will when I get a chance. Although this product works and I imagine it's really helpful for people with difficult to reach problems etc, I found the homedics shiatsu pillow just as effective for getting right into my knots, and all I have to do is position it and lean on it. Thus, I've used the massage pillow much much more. That thing is genius. For more specific stuff, this is probably a good thing to have around. Also, the booklet is very helpful, and may be all you need to give yourself a good massage."
3,No Instructions Included in Package,"I think this product will be good. However, I did not recieve any instructions on the methods to use the cane. If I had recieved instructions I would rate this as good."
3,Some relief,"It's a little confusing to use this product at first, and takes a few uses before it starts to make sense and you figure out what works for you. Unlike a hot/cold pack it doesn't generate an instant feeling of comfort and relief, but I can feel the knots coming undone in my shoulder. I gather it's one of those products that works better the more you use it."
5,Self-Relief,I windsurf. That means the bod requires some therapy. Theracane is a huge addition to my stash of body tools. It's powerful; can get to places that other tools cannot. This thing is major. Get one.
5,yes!,I used to use this at physical therapy all the time and i can not even begin to explain how happy i am to have one of my own. it is so nice to be able to pamper myself with a good massage even when i am in to much pain or too broke to want to deal with someone else giving me one.
5,Best invention EVER.,"Holy moley! How did I ever live without one of these things?If you have a lot of tension spots in your back and shoulder areas, you probably need this. So simple and not overly priced. Just right and works wonders. I've had chronic headaches from my shoulder muscles and this thing does the trick! Pain and headaches are much much more mild, and I have days I feel great now instead of my muscles just being okay.A+"
3,Some minor relief?,"After reading all the favorable reviews, I decided to give this thing a try. I have followed the instructions that came with the cane, and I do think it has helped my back pain slightly. But no great improvement. I plan to continue using to see if prolonged use can improve the results. My biggest disappointment is that the cane is way over priced. Somebody is making a lot of money......"
5,IT WORKS,While it looks abit weird; it reaches all the spots you cannot reach on your own. I recommend this highly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great on Knots---Thera Cane,"This product is terrific. I keep it by my chair and use it just about every night on the knots in my shoulders. It's so fantastic, I have bought it for others."
5,Couldn't be without it,"I have owned this for several years. It's like having a pressure-point masseuse available every day on an as-needed basis. I find I have knots that come back and require several days of pressure, off and on, to get rid of them...and this does the trick. I would recommend it very highly."
5,Life Saver,This saved me when I was struggling with upper back and neck pain and spasms. Wonderful tool that allowed me to work on my own body and recover much quicker than previous episodes.
5,TheraCane is Good Therapy,My brother has a TheraCane and I knew I had to get one after using it while visiting one weekend. I've been able to find and resolve several painful knots in my back in the first few days of using the massager. My husband has been just as successful in dissolving his stress knots.
5,Hits the hard-to-reach spots! Ahhh.....,"Have had accupuncture, Chiropractic, yoga, and physical therapy for my stiff shoulders and back. This cane is the most cost-effective way, at least for me, to deal with my annoying shoulders and back: I paid $34.95 plus free shipping. It hits the hard-to-reach spots! Ahhhhh....."
5,Thera Cane,"I bought three Thera Canes, one for my Mom, sister and myself. We all LOVE this item and wonder what we did without it!"
5,Works just as advertised!,"I bought this to get out all the kinks in my back. I would love for my husband to give me a massage to do this, but let's get realistic, it just aint gonna happen frequently! This is easy to use, and really gets to those trigger points. My husband did not enjoy it though, even with me oooohhning and awwing over it. Good for the large muscle groups, I really didnt find it easy to use with the smaller muscle groups, but as i bought this specifically for my back, it's perfect! The accompaning booklet warns not to get too over zealous on the first use as you would be bruised the next day, and i was! (over zealous and bruised feeling, but no actualy bruising showing up) Plan on using this alot."
5,Recommended by my physical therapist,"This allows you to reach that spot that you can't get to without tightening up all the surrounding muscles. In some ways it is better than having someone else massage ""the spot"" because you can precisely locate the spot and stay on it, where someone else tends to drift off without really knowing it or not get just the right amount of pressure."
3,Just like it looks,"The cane is a well made product. The cane is solid and firm, however I find it difficult to manipulate to any real effect. The ""owners manual"" was not very helpful."
4,Theracane,The theracane has a good shape and weight to it. It allows me to hit any trigger points in my musculature that I need to massage.
5,Works very well...,"My PT recommended this to me because of knots in my shoulders that never seem to go away. This really helps with my sore neck and headaches and I can do it anytime. It really is very versatile and with a little practice, it really adds to your physical well being."
4,Decent relief,"Don't expect it to be quite as comfortable as getting a real massage, but if you get tense frequently this is a really great way to alleviate the pain. When I get stressed out the muscles in my shoulder blades get so tight I can't release the tension without something to rub against it. This does the trick and keeps the soreness away."
3,"weak material - used for 5min after opening, not since",It's overly flexible and frankly isn't that great of a product for isolating massage areas. I probably should have investigated a little more into the other reviews before buying but it was cheap enough I thought it might be a good call - this one didn't pay off though. Avoid.
4,No pain from the cane - no gain,"I injured muscles in my back and shoulder and was able to reach and work out the knots very effectively with the Thera Cane. It can be a bit painful at first, but you certainly know when you have found the right spot to massage!The product works very effectively and allows you to put firm pressure on places you would otherwise not be able to reachVery clever design!"
5,I don't leave home without it!,"I had shoulder surgery about 10 years ago. The repair was perfect and I have full strength and range of motion, but I still get muscle knots from time to time. My wife's hands aren't strong enough to really work that area with enough pressure, or long enough, to make any real difference.Enter the Thera Cane... What an awesome invention! Any time I start feeling tension in my upper back or shoulders, I whip this thing out and I can kneed the affected area with more than enough pressure for as long as needed.If you have chronic tension in your upper and/or lower back, and you don't have a personal masseuse to follow you around all day, then you need one of these..."
5,Just get it.,"I had been suffering with pain the mid-back and shoulder blade region. I was looking for back massagers and noticed the Thera Cane when I saw all the positive reviews. I ordered it on a lark, not really understanding how it worked. Let me just say it has made a world of difference for me. As soon as I started to use it, I was able to locate the trigger point of my pain right below my left shoulder blade. When I touched that point with the cane, it felt like a knife stabbing in. I gently massaged the area, and over a few minutes, the pain began to go away. The relief radiated outward and I felt better than I had in a long time. Now, every time my pain acts up, I go right to the cane. I have found that I have multiple trigger points and I can reach them all with the cane. This simple device is now truly a part of my life, and I would recommend it (and have recommended it) to anyone."
3,theracane,It's not as easy to use as I thought it would be. Kind of awkward. You need to practice to be able to use it properly.
4,Works great on trigger points,"I work long hours in a factory. It helps to use this before bed, so I don't wake up acing as bad. Would be good for people who live alone and don't have anyone to massage there back."
4,Works out those knots,"Love this massager! It has really helped to work the knots of of my neck and shoulders. I only wish it came with the user manual, which I was able to find online."
5,Thera Cane,This does a really good job. No surprises. You can get to exactly the spot you need to work on since you are totally in control of the massage head.
3,theracane,"This item works, but you can't use it too much or too hard or you could damage your muscles. This is something not explained in the catalog and I had to learn this from my physical therapist. I also don't think it's worth the money I paid for it, but if you are desperate like I was, you will try anything for pain relief. I would recommend a good message over this product."
2,Not that great,"I have muscle pains all over my back and I have just about everything imaginable to try and get at the muscles from the panasonic massage chair to this device. If it is out there I've probably tried it. There is no way this device deserves 5 stars for its purpose. Sure it gets some of the hard to get spot, but it is nothing permanent and rubbing it with a knob doesn't really remove the muscle knot. It is ok for itchy back, and for minor muscle irritations, but don't buy this thinking this will be the cure for your severe muscle spasms or fibromyalgia or even myofasciitis. You need someone to work their thumbs or a rounded ball to really work it out directly on the muscle. There isn't even torque produced by the curvature of this product to do any real muscle release."
1,Save your money,"This came highly recommended by a 37-year-old friend with a muscle problem in his back. Since I, too, have a muscle problem in my back, I ordered it. This was a mistake. I had asked him, ""Isn't it a glorified back scratcher?"" And he had assured me it was not. It is.There is nothing ""therapeutic"" about it. You point the ball at your problem area and press. I'm very sorry to report that this does no particular good. I tried it for at least a week and it turned out to be...a glorified back scratcher.The pictures of it are appealing and the idea is appealing, but -- sad to say -- this will not address, or ameliorate any serious or unserious problem. It may feel good for a moment or two but it does no good. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news."
5,loved the thera cane massager,Loved the thera cane massager. helps to get rid neck and back pain. easy to use and fun. the whole family enjoys it.
4,TheraCane works great,Outstanding tool! Works great for back stiffness when no one is there to help.
3,Another Lotus book,This book is a great one for individuals not familiar with Lotus competition cars. Plenty of photographs and good descriptions of each of the marks. The author seems to have a great body of information that he re-cycles every once in a while with another book. Those of us who have read lots of Lotus history will recognize many of the photographs as previously published in many other sources. There isn't enough new information here to make me want to keep this book in my library. It is a nice compilation of Lotus cars to bring one up to speed.
5,Worthy,"I have read this book twice, something I almost never do, in preparation for the next in the series. The style switches viewpoints between the main players fairly successfully, so the reader knows what is going on as people seem driven by an unseen fate involving three worlds and three peoples. The settings are very realistic, the main characters appealing. I highly recommend this book."
3,It wants to be epic...,"...but I am not quite certain that it ever will be.Irvine, as noted by other reviewers, is clearly good at plotting. I was interested in the world portrayed by this novel and that alone would probably motivate me to buy the next book. The characters are rather less compelling, and Irvine too often writes in cliche. I wanted to shake Llian more than I wanted to like him.I am curious to see what the next installment is going to bring."
1,Poorly written Jack Vance Imitation,"Ian Irvine supposedly was influenced in his writing by the great stylist Jack Vance-maybe so, but certainly not in plot structure (if any) or prose (poor, at best). Bluntly, don't bother. Look for some of the witty works of Geary Gravel (The Dreamwright, The Shadowsmith) or Paula Volsky (The Luck of Relian Kru, The Grand Ellipse) for similar, better authors."
1,Painfully bad,"This is one of the worst written books I've ever read.It's so bad, it's painfully bad. I read parts aloudto my wife as a laugh.One scene in particular near the start stands out...One of the characters (a while since I tossed the bookacross the room so I can't remember the name) is talkingto a woman on a hill (she sought him out). For threepages or so he sprouts monologue to her with no more than theoccasional few words from her regardless of what he says,then she ups and leaves. Talk about information dumping!I am convinced this book was published without editing."
4,"Great Book, Flawed Kindle Version","I read this book years ago and loved it. I still do. I have one problem with the kindle version though. I wanted to reread it but left my paper copy in another state so I decided to purchase the kindle version. Almost immediately I noticed some strange typos. Whatever software they are using to scan the text and convert it for kindle has a problem. There are frequent typos throughout the book. They are very distracting. I have noticed many cases where 'that' appears as 'mat', 'the' as 'die' etc.It isn't just with small words like those. Punctuation is missing, random letters are missing from words. Someone really should have read through this before they put it up on Amazon.Other than that it's a good book that I'd recommend to anyone who loves a good story."
2,Not as good as it might have been...,"I found it to be quite a bit disappointing. Perhaps Irvine should attempt to emulate the worldbuilding of Feist. I am halfway through the second book it it appears to be going downhill and is not as suspenseful as many other books I've read. Even Jordan's first few books were better before he devolved into go nowhere, do nothing books selling on his name. I think Dune will be much better, so I may start that instead of finishing this series - it just doesnt seem good value at (price)(aus) a book."
1,How on Earth did this get published?,I could only get through half the book before putting it down for good. I should have quit a quarter of the way through but kept hanging on to see if lightning would strike. It didn't.The characters are wooden and don't act realistically. They don't even act stereotypically and that would have been better because they're all stereotypes anyway. The writing and plot drag on and on. The place names are ridiculous. This is the most stunning display of bad writing I've seen in quite a while. Thankfully the author seems to have a decent first career to continue.And there's three more books in this series. That can only be explained by a very good agent who got the four book contract before delivery of the first manuscript. Either that or the publisher stayed home sick one day and the interns went on a buying spree.
2,Barely worth the effort,"Forget the hyped reviews this is a very average fantasy book with poorly drawn characters and bad dialogueIt should have worked. The world seems to be well thought out, the action is reasonable and nothing (except the writing) is too corny... The book is completely undermined by the boring prose and the prosaic bores.Now I do not enjoy an author who does not trust the reader enough to allow him to read between the lines. There are no lines to read between in this book. Every sentence is written in a very stilted fashion, and Irvine constantly interrupts his flow with an aside that would, given time, have become perfectly obvious.It seems Irvine was too attached to his work, too anxiously trying to control what the reader thinks and imagines whilst reading, leaving the book contrived and overwritten.So although I will probably wonder what happens, (it does SOUND interesting, it just doesn't READ interesting) I couldn't bear to read and find out."
2,Predictable and inconsistent,"I was disappointed in this book, had I not been on a coast-coast flight I would not have finished it. The author could not keep track of whether his characters had their footwear on or off, among other problems. The two main characters could not between them fight their way out of a wet paper bag if decision making were part of the process. Watching them do stuipid things repeatedly for the sake of the plot became very trying.It's too bad, the universe is interesting."
5,Excellent!!,"Taking place in Tillamook, Oregon, its the story of a troubled familyand the distraction a young girl finds in the local legend of Spanishtreasure. With a bunch of actors I recognize from other projects (iethe mother also has a significant role in Romy and Michelle's HighSchool Reunion with Lisa Kudrow), it had pretty impressive star powerfor a low-budget indie. I had the pleasure of meeting the cast andmakers of this film at a family film festival I went to with my parentsand little brother. I was able to get a copy of their film after andwatched it with my little brother-- it was actually really excellent!Not too many ""family"" movies interest him as he's 11 and thinks he'stoo mature for kid stuff, but we had a really nice time together. Iwould highly recommend this for anyone to watch."
3,It was Okay!,"I watched this with my grandkids, they seemed to like it more than I did. I just couldn't get into it!"
2,Wanted to like this,"I'm a big fan of Red Crow Westerman and wanted to like this movie, but it was basically a lousy TV show with cameo appearances by Red Crow. Very disappointing, sorry. It had all the hokey aspects of a low-grade Walt Disney movie."
3,Home memories,"Having grown up in this area and was very familar with several tresure stories both Pirate and American Indian in origin, I purchased the video because of the scenery and not for the story.The beach depicted in most of the movie is the Manzanita Beach and the small mountain in the background is called Neah-Kah-Nie.I will watch this over and over whenver I get home sick."
1,TILLAMOOK GOLD?????,"THOUGH THIS WAS FILMED IN MY HOMETOWN ON THE COAST OF OREGON....IT IS LAME, LAME, LAME. THE PLOT LINE IS BOTH SIMPLE AND YET CONFUSING. THE ACTING IS 2ND RATE. THE LOCALE, THOUGH, IS GORGEOUS!"
4,Lost and Found,"I bought this album as an LP in the early 80's. I paid $1.99 from the CUT-OUT BIN (do they do cut-outs of CD's?). I bought it primarily for the exceptional 'Haunts of Ancient Peace' - because of the trumpet part mainly. After recording this track to a compilation tape, I had never listened to the LP again - until last night.I was listening to Miles Davis live at the Plugged Nickel club (Green Dolphin Street and So What) and a notion came over me to listen to Common One.After being deceived by the vast majority his output since Veedon Fleece (the only album I found really fulfilling since was Avalon Sunset), I finally appreciated Common One for what it was. I strongly recommend any fan of Van's who prefers the jazz of his 70's albums' to that of his 90's and recent work, this is a lost gem - found again. It's only when I directly compared it to one of the jazz greats that I recognized its true quality."
4,classic van with nice strings and literary references,Worth getting for anyone into Van Morrison. Does not include the songs Moondance or Brown Eyed Girl so don't get it if thats what you dig.
2,Major disappointment,"As a major Van fan I was very surprised to finally run across a weak album of his. Stay away from this one. ""Satified"" and ""Spirit"" are the only songs up to usual level."
1,morose,"I LOVE Van, but this is so whiney and morose it is painful to listen to. definitely not ONE song making it onto my ipod."
2,There's nothing wrong with your CD player,"""When Heart is Open"" may be the most excruciatingly boring fifteen minutes of music I have ever listened to: a slow, liveless reading of poor poetry. Most of the other songs aren't much better. At first listen, I thought I had a problem with a defective CD -- surely nobody intended music to sound like this.I'll give this CD two stars only because ""Summertime in England"" has a few good moments when the brass section kicks in and it swings."
4,Worth it for summertime in England,The entire album seems to revolve around one long and ever modulating track: Summertime in England. One Van's longest songs which rivals only with Autumn song.
1,Does not play in a computer,"It may be great but I may never know!! I know that some people still have a ""cd player"" type of device but really... most people probably do not. This will not play on a computer- maybe try your luck on an older version without the viruses."
4,Highly Recommended,"Red Dirt is a very touching story with endearing characters. Tag Purvis has done a wonderful job capturing the isolation and somber feeling of the south. Beautifully shot and superbly acted, the movie explores important issues (self-identity and family bonds) in an understated fashion. Outstanding performances all around from the main cast, particularly from Karen Black as Summer and Aleska Palladino as Emily."
4,"Wonderful story, good production, awesome cast.","It's great to see that some people realize that [an alternative social] life isn't bound by borders of big cities like New York City or LosAngeles.Mississippian Tag Purvis comes home (back to Meridian, Mississippi to be exact)to film this wonderful film.I won't go into the details as they are already detailed above - except I will say that Karen Black (Aunt Summer) rocks in this film and Dan Montgomery (Griffith) not only is a [good looking] but he can actually act.I just want to thank Tag and other [alternative social life style]Mississippians (be sure to read Mississippian Dr. John Howard's book 'Men Like That: A Southern Queer History'- availabe here on Amazon.com) for putting the spotlight on ... Mississippi and the ... South."
2,Interesting but not compelling,"Not a bad movie but worth a rental only. Karen Black was campy and fabulous as always but the movie never really took off. While it was realistic in many aspects, it just never got me to care that much about the main characters."
2,Lacks credibility,"Rich cinematography, artistic direction and an effective setting help ""Red Dirt"" convey a mood of sweltering Southern gothic decadance but it is unfortunatelly not enough to recommend this film. The film, concerning a young man coming to grips with life in a small Mississippi town while caring for his mentally unstable aunt and eventual coming out, is slow to develop and the weak script fails to ignite any credibility. The revelation that there is a romantic attraction between the two male actors is as unconvincing as the kiss between them in the final scene.Basically, the actors are fine except that they try to speak in a ridiculous Southern aristocratic accent which, news flash!, no longer exists in the contemporary South. Karen Black, always an interesting and talented actress, seems to have watched too many Tennessee Williams plays for her character.And, on another ludicrous note, gardeners in the South begin to harvest their tomatoes in June, not begin to plant them!"
2,Just... A... Little... Slow... and Incomplet.....,"It appears most reviewer either loved ""Red Dirt"" or hated it. I certainly wish I'd liked it better. The cinematography is gorgeous (as everyone agrees); I'm okay with the acting; the script, however, slowly, ponderously, goes nowhere--which is the point of this film, I suppose. I recommend renting this film if you're hankering to experience vicariously the life of a young, bored, gay man (but not out to himself or anyone) trapped by circumstances and a dysfunctional, immediate family to continue in an empty, unfulfilled existence in the deep South, rather than take some chances, make some changes and move on."
1,Terrible disappointment!,"Poor acting and directing. Story written by a high school student in their English class. Could have been great. No recognizable emotional intimacy between the two male protagonists. Gay themed? Only a lot of blah, blah, blah."
2,RED DIRT--SOMEWHAT INTERESTING BUT SLOW,"THE MOVIE HAS GREAT PRODUCTION VALUES, AND I'M SURE SOMEWHERE IN THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT THERE WAS A GREAT MOVIE, BUT THIS REALLY ISN'T EVEN GAY ORIENTED AS IT IS LISTED, JUST AN AVERAGE STORY TOLD IN A LESS THAN AVERAGE WAY. BEST FEATURE IS THE CUTE LEAD ACTOR, LITTLE ELSE. I FELL ASLEEP."
2,Huh? And?,"I just watched ""Red Dirt"" for the first time and I must say I am baffled. I'm baffled that this film actually got financing and I simply cannot comprehend how Karen Black's agent allowed her to do this. Yes, the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, but that can't make up for a plot that goes nowhere and doesn't really investigate any of its seemingly multifaceted characters. While there is a great deal of homoerotic tension between Griffith and Lee, it is never fully explored or explained. Don't bother renting/buying this film. There are much better films out there about the South (Gone with the Wind), family secrets (Secrets & Lies), people realizing they might be gay (Defying Gravity), etc."
2,Wait for it....,"Red dirt features some wonderful scenery and great camera-work, but...the plot is dire! I kept waiting for lightning to strike, some sort of revelation. When it finally came, it was more of a: ""And now, the weather"" kind of thing. No real pain here, no heartbreak. Just people shambling about, doing their business.It's a real pity, because the male actors are sooo attractive. Dan Montgomery and Walter Goggins. Good looking guys. But we don't get to see very many scenes of their evolving friendship. Contrary to the picture on the cover, the main story concerns a family secret. And what about that ending?My DVD doesn't give any clues, as the extras are spare. The trailer, a short by Tag Purvis, scene access and filmographies. No deleted scenes, no interviews, nothing. Shame. I would like to see more of Tag Purvis, though. The camera-work is so beautiful, you feel he has a great film in him."
2,Not worth the time or money,"Ever watch a movie and feel like you were cheated out of two hours of your life? Well that might help to describe the feeling I was left with after watching this movie. As a person who lives in the South, I've come to realize that there is nothing worse than actors who portray Southerners who can't pull off a believable southern accent. Couple this with a story line that goes no where and leaves you simply annoyed by the end of the movie and you might start to get a feel for this movie. True, some of the actors in the movie are beautiful to look at(Dan Montgomery is drop dead beautiful), but sheer beauty cannot overcome the first few spoken words out of his mouth.This could have been a great ""coming of age"" movie set in the deep south, but it just doesn't succeed."
1,"Wow, this is bad","I've never reviewed a movie here before, but I felt an obligation to the community. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. If it were just slightly worse it might be funny enough to redeem itself. But it's not. It's just bad. High school script writing, atrocious direction, nearly comical southern accents. I was embarrassed by watching it."
3,Mad about Dirt,"Hello,I have not seen this movie yet but what I have read about it, it sounds quite interesting so I gave it 3 stars just from what I read and plus i had to give it a rating.My problem is I am the kind of person who actually reads the reviews of products I might consider to buy,and if I am unsure on a product I will go by what the reviews say.Having said that it comes down to this,I am starting to feel like I cant even read the reviews of movies anymore for the fear that someone might give away a key elment to the movie or worse yet give away the entire thing. So why on earth would a reviewer tell us all a key element is beyond me.I cant stand when someone does that,Its rude and more important quite annoying. So I hope that this particular person will refrain from spilling elements of that nature in reviews from now on. Nothing against him but it not fair to someone who has not seen it yet,like me for instance."
1,I GOT THE WRONG MOVIE,I ordered Red Dirt through this company and they sent me a Japanese foreign film. I have tried to contact them a couple of times and I haven't gotten a response.
3,Wasn't my thing,"The movie was well filmed, directed and acted. I gave it 3 stars for that. I just couldn't get into it though. It was slow, over-dramatic, and not entirely believable."
2,Disappointing,"Despite some lovely cinematography and serious eye-candy (Dan Montgomery, the star of the movie), ""Red Dirt"" is tragically flawed. With stilted, unnatural dialogue, ham-handed and mostly hysterical theatrics, and entirely too much melodrama for its own good, the movie begins with very little as a premise, and ends with very little as a conclusion. The writing is sloppy and meanders pointlessly back and forth, with storylines that have no place within the primary plot, and viewers are left, after an hour and forty-five minutes of bad Southern drawls and D-grade ""subplots"", with one badly-acted kiss, and very little resolution.While I tend to give the world of gay film much leeway, in this case, I'm afraid, nothing but condemnation will do. Not worth purchasing, and only marginally worth renting."
1,A Truly Awful Viewing Experience,"I almost became catatonic watching this movie. Contrived and dull, horrible acting ¡K I honestly don¡t know what Karen Black was thinking ¡V the accent alone was almost enough to make me want to trash this DVD. Beware!"
2,One more reason Karen Black's career is dead,"This thing should have come with a laugh track or maybe pop-up dialog balloons that could have breathed some life into this ponderously pretentious piece of poop. The Two Star rating is based strictly on the cuteness of the main male character, Griffith (Dan Montgomery). If the rating seems shallow and arbitrary, you should see the movie."
2,NO NO NO,"this is a poor excuse for a film and should in no way be considered part of the gay film genre, much less a decent film of ANY genre. I only give it two stars because of the beautiful cinematography, camerawork and use of the Southern landscape.southern gothic to its boring core, full of pauses and eccentricities without deepness or real meaning.the two male leads relationship is barely homoerotic much less homosexual. one short chaste kiss does not make up for endless scenes of hamfisted acting.Dan Montgomery is good in this and I can only think that is why he is the only person from this movie still working.if you are still curious after this warning, I beg of you, give no money to the filmakers. RENT it."
3,"REALLY strange, oddly seductive","At first you wonder what kind of wierd, slow-motion, Gothic pastoral you've wandered into here: Karen Black WAY over the top as a crazy old southern lady languishing in a backwoods Mississippi victorian house; out front incestuous cousins are lolling in the frog pond; the actors, with abominable southern accents are reading from an overblown script, pondering life's mysteries, dreamily muttering profundities like coffee house intellectuals in a Swedish art movie. But in spite of everything the damn thing sucks you in, Karen Black turns out to be amazing, and when the male love interest shows up, hubba hubba. It all somehow works, till the ending (which is long overdue), where they totally cop out and Gay love dare not consumate itself on the aforementioned Red Dirt. No one gets what they want, and everything just kind of sinks back down beneath the lily pads...."
4,Only one-tenth gay film,"Karen Black does a superb job as ""Summer"" in this steamy film about Southern angst, portraying the decayed Southern ""aristocrat"" who languishes on problems nineteen years in the past, while her ""nephew"" Griffith only wants to get away from Pine Apple. My only complaint, since I was expecting this to be a gay film, is that the gay undertone and eventual ""coming out"" is kind of tacked on to the end of the movie, like an afterthought. Still, an absorbing, luscious film. ---Ronald L. Donaghe ..."
5,Karen Black is Back!,"""Red Dirt"" was a poetic reflection of life in the American rural South. For Karen Black it was a role that was reminiscent of Geraldine Page in ""A Trip to Bountiful."" If you love Karen Black, then you will adore her here. And if you are unaware of her talent, there is no greater place to discover it. How unfortunate that we don't see more films like this that move to a different pace and don't strive to live up to stale stereotypes."
3,Balance lost...?,"If so much of this movie had not been spent on the character played by Karen Black I would have given it 5 stars. I felt the other characters were left on the side, sadly, and this created a sense of imbalance."
1,A waste of time,"It's about a young man who lives in Mississippi town with his mentally ill aunt. His cousin (not his aunt's daughter) is in love with him and they do (or did) have a sexual relationship. Here come Lee Todd into town and wants to rent his cottage. There is homosexual tension between the two of them but neither acknowledges it.A snarky side of me wants to call this ""Brokeback Swamp"" but this film is more Southern Gothic and a B film at best. It's slow moving and nothing much happens. Avoid this film."
1,Make another choice,"Unless you are a fan of the actors in this film, I suggest you make another choice. I showed this film to a group of friends, having only the reviews on Amazon to go by, and the resounding comment was dismal. The progression of this movie is extremely SLOW and the speaking is muffled. There is a reason why there are so many copies of this movie up for re-sale."
1,A Liberal's View of the South and a Giant Waste of Time,"As someone who was born and grew up in the South and who has lived his share of Hell in the North, I can assure this giant waste of time is something you should skip and never have one second of regret. Just leave this afront to every Southerner worth his salt on the shelf and save your money. This awful visual pollution has no redeaming value what-so-ever."
1,Nice idea that doesn't come together,"This is one of the most professionally produced Independent Films I've seen in a long time. The casting is generally good, the cinematography well done. Unfortunately, the script is very poorly written. The characters are shallowly drawn, the plotting unbelievable and inconsistant, and the Aunt's surprise announcement? Anyone who didn't figure that out in the first five minutes was probably so bored they weren't paying attention. It's all a real shame too -- because the idea is an interesting one, and in better hands could have been a compelling story."
1,Disappointing,"It feels as if this storey goes nowhere.Acting is quite good and the guys are not too bad looking either.I suppose its possible to edit this whole film to fit into 10 minutes without losing any story lines.I was looking for more in this film, I didn't find any value in Red Dirt therefore mine is up for sale."
2,Mink Oil Review,"I was rather disappointed because of: 1) the odor of the oil is fairly offensive. There was no mentioning of this in the product advertisement...I was not ready for that, 2) I did not see any outstanding results after using it for a few times...again it may require a longer period to see results. But, the advertisement did not prepare me for that. For $75 (3 oz) oil treatment I expected a lot more."
2,Wrinkled beyond belief,"I didn't realize how spoiled I was by various other brands' no-iron / wrinkle-free shirts until the first time I wore this Paul Fredrick shirt. The act of tucking in the shirt rendered the two-three inches of the shirt ballooning out from my waistband look like a sheet of crumpled paper. Sitting down rendered the whole back of the shirt as wrinkled as a raisin. And this was within minutes of putting it on. By the end of a day of wearing it, it looked as though I had packed the shirt into one of those plastic eggs that hosiery come in, left it there for the better part of a year, and then put it right on. Ugh! It's been hanging unworn in the closet ever since."
4,VERY GOOD & HAPPY WITH PRODUCT !!!! ;),THIS IS A GOOD FUN FAST EASY GAME THAT I REALLY ENJOY !!!! ALL IS WORKIING WELL AND VERY GOOD AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT ALL AND THE SELLER !!!! THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!!! ;)
2,Stylish - But tight on the ankles,"These boots are cool looking. My only complaint about these boots is they are super tight around the ankle. I am fairly slender with skinny ankles, if anything I usually have problems with boots being too big - however I have to wear a thick pair of wool socks with these boots so they don't rub on my ankles when I dance or walk. I'd hoped wearing the thick socks would stretch them eventually but no dice - they are cut too tight. I imagine they'd be very uncomfortable for girls with largish ankles or lower legs."
2,"Cute, but uncomfortable","I love boots and have quite a collection. These boots look nice, but everything ends there. These are so uncomfortable to walk in. I've had heels which are more friendly on my feet. These pinch and slide in all the wrong places"
3,frustrated,"I love these boots and bought them to be my comfy every day boots. But while the foot of these boots fit great the legs didn't fit the calf shaping started 1"" lower than my own and cut in so badly at the top it hurt( even with the elastic built in). I spend $40 to get them stretched twice before I could even get them zipped comfortably!! So sad designers need to realize the bigger the foot the longer the leg... so on"
4,ARE THESE LEATHER???,Sorry I didn't know where to ask because it doesn't specify how the shoes are made. But are they leather!??? Or not? Please let me know asap since I am interested in buying them. Thanks.
3,Ladies Man By The Numbers,"In his skin-tight jeans and insinuating voice, Sheppard came on like a love god who could only be satisfied by the hottest angel in honky tonk heaven. Those who blame the likes of Shania Twain and Faith Hill for taking the country out of country music should get a load of these formulaic songs that topped the charts 20 years ago. Barely this side of Barry Manilow in their calculated appeal, these interchangeable tunes are a long pickup ride from Merle Haggard and George Jones or anything halfway authentic. Still, you can't help but love the rollicking piano work in ""Party Time,"" the best song in the collection, or the ribald storytelling in ""Do You Wanna Go To Heaven."" Forgettable country pop done to perfection. Let's hope Sheppard cashed in--big--on his popularity before he faded into obscurity."
4,I Feel Like Loving You Again....,"Great collection but where is the song ""I Feel Like Loving You Again"" (the studio version)? I can't seem to find it anywhere except on his ""Live at Billy Bob's"" CD. That song was #1 according to Billboard Country so why isn't it on any of his greatest hits recordings?"
4,The original versions!,"Hey, given how bad and synthesizer-heavy the Country charts were back in the 1980s, this really ain't that bad. Sheppard was basically following in Conway Twitty's footsteps, doing the same rugged/sensitive lady's man routine... and his arrangements were hardly as poppy as many of his contemporaries; in fact some of these songs are downright fun.NOTES ON THIS EDITION: this CD contains the **original** versions of these songs (unlike several subsequent albums of re-recorded versions...) Also note that this disc and the Y2K release, ""Super Hits Series"" are identical, except for the artwork..."
3,They didn't go back far enough,"Too bad they left out 'Devil in the Bottle', 'Mr. DJ', 'Rollin' with the Flow' and 'Pigskin Charade' (probably because they were by T.G.'s original producer and label - business politics stink!). It's a shame because T.G. had some great songs on those early albums, too."
5,T.G. Sheppard - All-Time Hits,"I didn't realize T.G. Sheppard had all these hits - this CD took me back quite a few years and brought back some great memories. Favorite tracks are ""Somewhere Down The Line,"" ""Only One You,"" and ""I'll Be Coming Back For More."" Great CD - listen to it often."
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,"This filter does what it is supposed to do. It works very well with well-defined points of light. It may work too well. If there are multiple lights in the scene, they become the focus of the image instead of a background feature. I am sure there are ways to work around this. It is cheap enough that you can play around with it without breaking the bank. It is mostly a fun toy, but under the right circumstances it could be a useful tool for a hobbyist."
3,"Not the worst, not the best.","I can't say I didn't like this book, but it was pretty predictable. The first chapter really draws you in, but then the rest of the story doesn't really match the first chapter. If you wan't some light reading that doesn't require too much thought, this is the book for you."
3,Good but somewhat dissappointing,"I am a huge fan of Heather Graham/Shannon Drake. I love her style of writing. After reading Haunted, I was a little dissappointed with The Presence. I had already guessed who the killer was and found the ending to be predictable and kind of abrupt. There were some misleading statements made by the other characters which were ignored and not explained by the ending of the book. It is still a good read but not as good as her other works.I would recommend Haunted anyday over The Presence."
3,decent read but who set the type?,"I have read many books by this author some are wonderful, some are not. This was a light read for a weekend but I had to keep myself reading it. I was looking for a lot more suspense after that first chapter. One of the main reasons I had trouble staying with the story was the type. It goes from standard set to italic with no reason. So if you think (by the type) that a flashback or dream is about to happen; WRONG, just more of the previous conversation. It drove me NUTS!"
2,Can't really recommend,"I can't really recommend this book. I thought the overall story had the potential to be good, but it was never truly developed. A bit predictable and i found the initimate relationship between the two main characters to not be very interesting or believeable. My book had large sections that were printed in parenthesis which i have to believe is grammartical and editing error. Felt a bit sloppy. Was a bit disappointed as I have always kept this author in my 'must read' column. Really wished that the author would have taken her time and really developed the story. Was not a bad read, but not anywhere near what i would expect from this author."
3,"Overlong, but sure to entertain Heather Graham fans","At times, I suspect I'm the only guy who will pick up and read a Heather Graham novel. I'm an obsessive mystery fan, and her books loosely qualify as mysteries although she centers on the romantic relationship between leading characters.I try to be fair and rate her books through the eyes of her fans, so I overlook much of the predictability and formulaic writing. That said, I doubt that even her fans will be crazy over this one. It does seem way too long for the substance. And there are signs of hasty writing not usually that obvious in her books. One ""red herring"" scene that casts suspicion on a couple of characters is never explained. Other red herrings are rather lame.The author's fans won't likely find this a bad book, but it is one of her obviously lesser efforts."
3,From bang to fizzle on one chapter,"This is the first book I have read by Ms. Graham, and I will give her another try. This story started out with a dramatic and spooky bang, but quickly fizzled and settled into a cross between the Hardy Boys Meets Gone With The Wind. It had all the elements in the beginning to be a ""keep you on the edge of your seat"" story. It quickly became a love story with a ghost thrown in to keep your attention. The thing that kept me reading the book was that it is well written and had just enough intrique to make me want to know how it ended.If you are looking for the thrills of Kay Hooper, you will not find them here. If you are looking for a light, airy love story with alittle booga-booga thrown in, you might want to try this one."
3,"Ok, but not excellent.","Before reading this book I had read ""Haunted"" and greatly enjoyed it so I decided to read another one of Graham's books. I have to say, I was somewhat disappointed with this one. From the beginning it was so predictable that Bruce MacNiall and Toni were the Laird MacNiall and Annalise from the past. I also didn't understand why at some points in the book, there were instances where Ryan and Gina discussed what they should do about Toni. What happened with this? Also, what was Thayer hiding? There was a suggestion that he wasn't really Toni's cousin but this storyline also went no where. I think the author tried to add things to lead the reader astray but then in the end, these instances were never explained. Overall, this book was entertaining but left too many questions for me."
4,ghost or no ghost?,"Toni Fraser and her friends have purchased a Scottish castle in hopes of turning it into a tourist attraction, reenacting the historic death of the laird's wife. Fictional story, or so they thought, until the current laird storms through the doors demanding an explanation. Luckily for Toni, his entrance worked right into their dramatization. Even luckier is his entrance on a Friday, when they have to wait until Monday to straighten things out. Laird Bruce lets them stay pending verification, and they all get wrapped up in the stories of the missing girls. Unfortunately Bruce found one of the girls murdered in the woods on his land, and there have been more suspicious instances surrounding the forest...could the ghost of the maligned historic laird be haunting the castle, searching for the ghost of his murdered wife?"
3,I Knew What I Was Getting Into,"The Presence is a typical Heather Graham, the prologue or first chapter has a great hook, especially the ones with the paranormal bent, and then it continues from there. It's also a typical Heather Graham in that she plays with giving just information about nearly every character that the reader is left thinking that every character could be ""the bad guy."" Heather Graham does this in each of her books though, so I expect it, and almost might be disappointed if she didn't, but then it is a tad overplayed.More here about The Presence and Heather Graham: http://kroniclesofkd.blogspot.com/2012/01/presence-heather-graham.html"
3,I would love to rent a castle with my 5 bffs,"In The Presence, Toni MacNally and her five best friends rent a Scottish castle to organize dinner theater tours. Suddenly, the real owner Bruce MacNiall, appears and they learn that the little play she wrote for the performances are based on real people from MacNiall's family.The real Bruce MacNiall is investigating a serial killer that is using his ancestral home as a dumping ground while the Scooby friends continue their performances. It gets really complicated fast. I did learn that no one really eats haggis.There are two mysteries here, the legend of the original Bruce MacNiall and the identity of the serial killer that is seeking the current Bruce MacNiall's attention"
4,Black & Decker Firestorm is great for the money and has a great warranty.,"Don't let other reviews turn you off on this great product. I have several Black & Decker power tools and they all work great. I have always gotten respectable battery life and performance out of all of my B&D; tools. Black & Decker also makes DeWalt tools. I can't believe anyone would think a company like B&D; would make and sell junk????If you have a problem with any B&D; or DeWalt tools, they have service centers all over the place that will take care of your problem (search for one near you at the B&D; website). You don't even need a receipt as they can check the date code that is right on the tool to see if it is still under warranty - 2 years for B&D; Firestorm products. Buy from them with confidence knowing they are a great product for the money and B&D; stands behind their products."
2,Do not leave battery charger unattended!,"The tools are well worth the price (inexpensive), but even with 18 volts, don't expect the power and durability of a 12 volt Dewalt, Milwaukee, or Hitachi comparable tool.The most concerning issue that I have about this kit is the battery system, where my first battery failed quickly, and my second battery melted in a short amount of time, fusing itself to the charger and becoming hot enough for the battery housing to melt away, exposing the cells within. Because of this and similar bad reviews regarding batteries and chargers, I will avoid any B&D; rechargable products. If you must purchase this kit or other B&D; rechargeable tools, keep an eye on the battery charger when you use it just in case of a meltdown..."
4,Excellent reference for managers!,"I find this book very helpful in my daily work because it's easy to use, understandable, and gives you direction on where to focus your attention depending on your current situation. Although it doesn't give you extensive discussions, it's still practical to have one around. Especially if you can get a copy for less than $9.00 - it's a winner!"
5,A coach for all your workplace questions,"With to-the-point topical chapters on many aspects of executive life - from Age to Writing Skills - this book is not to read cover to cover but rather the night before the big meeting. Acting as a coach, this book can replace that midnight phonecall to a trusted friend or that hour of doubt about the way to handle things. The presented Secrets of Success are quite simple - no deep management philosophy here - but a little logic and humanity is often just what the situation needs. The quotes by experts in the field make things crystal clear. Very useful for starting executives but also for the long-time CEO that needs a check-up to current ways. With a special feature on Decision Making."
1,"Illustrations necessary, but aren't here","This is apparently a child's book about pirates, which requires the pictures for it to make sense. Unfortunately, in this freebie version, the pictures aren't there."
2,Good graphics and just like the original game but...,"...it's not challenging. I beat Dig Dug Deeper using the game's default settings in under 4 hours. I think I ran out of men 5 times in that time span. From what I've seen, the hard version of Dig Dug Deeper isn't that much harder. Infogrames/Hasbro Interactive really dropped the ball this time after excellent releases like Q-Bert, Pac Man and Frogger. There should be a patch or another mode where we can enter as many creatures as we want. That's what makes Dig Dug and Dig Dug Deeper difficult, not having monsters you can destroy when their back is facing you."
3,Green,"I know the thing to do now-a-days is to br green, but who wants a bracelet that turns you arm green? Unfortunately, it wasn't until after receiving the bracelet, I had done further reseach and found the bracelets costing over $15.00 are the ones less likely to turn green. At least the magnets haven't fallen out as I've see in other reviews of other copper bracelets. It does seem to help with the pain in my shoulders somewhat. I also found in my research that you're better off getting a stainless steel bracelet if you don't want your arms and the bracelt turning green."
5,I Heard Them Live and Loved Them,"When I was a young jazz fan and lived in Rochester NY, I heard this duo live. They were giving a workshop for the students at the legendary Eastman School of Music jazz program in 1977, and I went to the concert they gave during their stay in Rochester.It was one of the wondrous live jazz experiences of my life. Gene and Michael played intensly and in synch. Jazz duos are special. They lack the usual piano, bass, drum comfort zone. In exchange, we get two master musicians trading music nakedly. They can play quietly, or they can swing intensely, as the spirit moves them. These two guys are two of the best at their stringed instruments.I have heard many duos that failed. This is not one of them. Get this recording to hear two masters at their best."
4,Beautiful trombone playing !,"Kai Winding Septet is superb but as a radio presenter it is esential I know who's doing the playing! I called Alan Kaplin in Los Angeles and he informed me that the other three trombones with Kaid Winding are Carl Fontana, Wayne Andre and Dick Leib. No credits on the label of this CD, my only complaint!"
2,"Misleading picture, glossy ceramics!","I am very disappointed at the glossy glaze of this heavy, cheap looking ceramic. The picture looks like matte stoneware and its color on the picture is much better than, what I got. The actual color is yellowish going into greenish rather than advertized cappuccino.The sugar bowl is TINY and the creamer is also smaller than usual.I ordered several accessories in this series to complement my stoneware dishes and have to return them all. The other items do have quality control sticker, no flaws in the finish."
2,"Has a few pros, but many cons","This is NOT a book for someone beggining C++ UNLESS they are familiar with the C language.I dont care what anyone says, it does not go into any detail at all for beginners.The best quiality about this book is that it appeals to anyone wishing to learn to use the wizards.Its is very confusing, has many typos, and hardly goes into detail about what the code does.Itll show you some code to type, then say what the code does, but it wont explain how each line of code works.WASTE OF MONEY ( I got mine free from a friend )"
1,One word: [Junk],"This book is horrible, it is not worth the paper it is written on. They did NOT know how to publish an informative book! Chapter 13 program does NOT even WORK!!! Even on the cd they provide it does NOT compile! Do not waste your money on this book!"
2,Not Good ENOUGH!,"A ""lot"" of pages ""wasted"" on providing source code for app-winzard generated code. At the same time i donot feel that the style of explaining is appropriate for a beginner to understand.If you value your money donot go for it instead take your chance on ""Teach yourself VC in 21 days"". I have found invariably all the teach yourself series books to be very good. And afterwards go for the standard David Kruglinski book on windows programming"
5,Great startup book for Visual C++ 6.0!,"This book is a must have for anyone who is starting up with Visual C++ 6.0 I had done almost no MFC programming prior to getting this book, and after reading it cover to cover, I have been able to write basic MFC applications. The book is also good at pointing you to the MS Reference CD locations for additional information that isn't covered. Though not a ""bible"" per se, it is a must have for Visual C++ beginners (you should know C however)."
1,Not useful unless you are already very familiar with VC++,"This book is certainly not the book you would want to read if you want to actually learn VC++. It gives good introduction to the wizards and new tools provided by VC++ 6.0. However, the book does not explain anything regarding the approach to programming using MFC or VC++ in general. Most of the book is filled with code that is automatically generated by the wizards, and that too without much explanation. The reader would keep on typing code and keep on running the applications successfully without knowing what is happening or why the code is being written the way it is written. Certainly not a book for beginners."
2,It's not a good book for how to use Visual C++,"This book has 1400 pages and it uses only about 10 pages to talk about the Visual C++ development environment. It uses around 300 pages talking about C++, from how to create a class. The rest of it is MFC.I think it's not a good book for professionals or the ones who look for a book about Visual C++ environment.It might be a good book for beginners, especially some one who even doesn't know C++ yet. I say it might be because I didn't read the section about MFC.Overall, it disappointed me, but may enlight other people."
2,Not of much worth,"Save you money for something better like teach yourself visual c in 21 days. The book is very big in size but that's it. Not much contents in it. It's written for programmers who don't know how to program in C++ and want to do programming in MFC. My advice to such an audience to grab two good books on for C++ programming and one for MFC. Lots of space is wasted with screen shots and cut-copy-paste of App-wizard generated code. Nothing is written on many important things like database connectivity. GUI is explained in detail but many other books cover even this topic in better and SHORTER way. Save you money instead go for this combination; buy first Robert's Lafore's ""Object Oriented Programming using Turbo C++"" for learning C++ and then buy ""special edition using visual C++ 6"" or ""teach yourself visual C 6 in 21 days"" to learn MFC."
2,Quality problem,The glass element was loose within filter ring (it rattled) and did not fill the entire aperture of the ring (the edge of the glass was visible).
4,hoya filter not the best but I use all the time,Hoya made good filter but not the best. When I order any new camera len I purchase anew filter too. High $ lens I use BW filter. This Hoya mult coated filter go with my Nikon 35mm f/1.8 len
5,Precision transparency!,"If you have an expensive lens to protect, this is well worth the extra dollars for the precision of its metal threads and the quality of its multi-coated optics. I'm very pleased with it - it's in front of my Nikon 18-200mm DSLR lens, doing what it's supposed to do."
5,Richard Gere shines!,One of my all time favourites...a very well acted drama with a great cast fronted by a very young and handsome Richard Gere. Has some wonderful moments of acting particularly from Paul Sorvino....I suppose it is a bit of a man's movie as opposed to a chick flick but it can be enjoyed by everyone. Highly recommended !
2,Eventide Pleasant but not Wonderful,"Like many sequels, Eventide does not live up to its origins, but if you liked the original characters, you may enjoy reading more about them."
1,Couldn't get past page 100,"I thought Plainsong was wonderful. This is made up of scraps from Haruf's garbage pile, parts that didn't fit into Plainsong, but that he loved too much to toss. There was absolutely no tension and no discernable plot. I also detest this ""artsie"" no quotation marks style. Somehow it distances me from the characters."
2,Not as good as plainsong,"I read this book but was not impressed with it as much as I was with Plainsong of which this is the sequel. It is about a small town, but some of the characters are dark, and you kind of knew where the book was headed bu it got pretty dark at times and was sad. I liked he Mcpherson brothers, but even that has an element of sadness. I didn't really enjoy this follow up as much as I liked Plainsong."
3,Easy to read,"Eventide is the sequel to Plainsong. If the first book appealed to you, this is a worthy successor.All is far from perfect in this little town and the countryside where the characters reside. The story, however, is realistic, engaging and memorable. One looks forward to the next book."
3,Quiet evening...,"This is not Kent Haruf's major achievement. Other readers have felt that Haruf was ""marking time"", using material he did not use in Plainsong... it seems possible. While the atmosphere of Holt and surrounding territory is strongly created, so much trivial detail - and the author's very annoying punctuation (or lack of) - are major detractions to me. If this ""fill in"" leads to a development of, say, the DJ character - who is here rather left out in the cold at the end - it will have been worth it. But Eventide seems very much made up of scraps from the writer's desk..."
2,Disappointed!,"I was so looking forward to reading this...but I'm glad I borrowed rather than bought it! I wonder if Haruf felt that he needed to publish something to keep his name out there. Although it was worth reading, it wasn't worth taking the time to read slowly and savor. Very predictable in most cases, and I think that the characters were more stereotypes than people I wanted to know, help or fell sorry for. A visit to a small town, it certainly was: how fast can I pass through and go home. I have read all his books and this is the first that I felt I wouldn't recommend to anyone.Plainsong made me want to move there, to invest time in the character...not so this one.I give it some credit, because it was written literately, with good use of language. It was well edited...no glaring typos to trip over. But, sorry amazon, get it from the library or borrow your friend's copy."
1,Absolutely pointless!,"What made Kent write this? Plainsong was an absolute gem -- stunning and self-contained. There was no need to write a sequal -- and this book seriously damages the wonderful feeling I had about this author.What was muted and understated in Plainsong feels merely shallow and undeveloped here. There's no addition to the perfectly formed characters of Plainsong that cried out for this nonsense. Granted, it's pleasant enough to read -- but in comparison to the shimmering brilliance of Plainsong this book feels like a cheap way to cash in on a good thing.Do yourself a favor if you really loved Plainsong -- SKIP THIS!!"
1,What happened to Haruf?,"With gift certificate in hand, I boldly purchased a hard copy of the book, eager to take up and continue the experience of reading ""Plainsong."" I read, I waited, I wondered, I grew frustrated, I abandoned hope. To say I was disappointed in this new book by Kent Haruf would be an overwhelming understatement. If ""Plainsong"" spoke to me in bold and archetypal terms of grace--unmerited kindness and love, ""Eventide"" dispenses cheap grace with its two-dimensional, stock and stereotypical characters and predictable events. Who cares about any of these Holt folks? Who can even tell them apart? Maybe it's just not feasible creating Plainsong II."
3,"For the price, it's ok","This worked as advertised, but under heavy daily use, it only lasted about three months."
2,Failed in six months,"Great stereo with good sound. Never should have ordered online, because I didnt notice it has a front faceplate that tilts up to insert CD. Experience has led me to avoid players with faceplates, and sure enough, after six months, pressing any button on the faceplate shuts the stereo off. Bye, Sony."
3,One Listen and it Goes on the Shelf,"Bought it on a recommendation. Has lots of great standards that I love but nothing particularly interesting about the presentation. My response after listening to it the first time: ""hmm..."" Not bad, but I seriously doubt that it will be on anyone's frequent play list. Fairly ordinary. I'll give it one more listen soon before I file it with the other dust collectors permanently. If I change my mind I'll update this review."
4,A Spicy Little Book,"Joel Denker, the author, is a history professor and very serious food hobbyest and writer. But don't be put off by the history professor background. The World on a Plate is, thankfully, intended for the general reader, not to bolster Denker's reputation among his academic colleagues. This is not a comprehensive or heavily analytical work. Rather, the book is an enjoyable, quick read that tells us a variety of stories, many with human interest, of the introduction of foods to the United States that originated in other countries and cultures. Did you know that a German restaurant owner in Texas, William Gebhardt, deserves a substantial amount of credit for bringing chili flavored dishes to the general public? That was a surprise to me. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in cooking and food. The only disappointment was that it ended abruptly on page 162. I wanted more."
2,Disappointing,"One of the other reviews mentions that this book isn't overly analytical. That's an understatement - this book barely holds together as a book, and there's no narrative through-line to the book. It's a collection of uneven essays and certain parts are quite a bit more detailed than others. The author pretty much acknowledges this in the introduction. There's simply not enough meat here - it's a loose collection of fun facts and information that seems assembled from other secondary sources. Put in comparison to other recent books on American food -- anything by Michael Pollan, The United States of Arugula, etc. this is pretty weak."
4,kitkat's games,"I can't comment too much on the game because I bought it as a gift for someone else, but I think they enjoy playing it."
5,CD Purchase,Product is as ordered new CD and plays very well. Order arrived before the estimated shipment arrival time frame.I would recommend this site purchase to everyone
3,Doing it by the book,"All business managers should read this book so as not to reinvent the marketing wheel. Great, classic marketing insights."
2,The condition of the book,The book looks quite old (i.e. there's a marker's mark and the book turns yellow) although the description of the book said that it is new.
4,Quality Stoneware,"This platter is a little larger than most and perfect for entertaining. I bring brownies, cookies etc to work and this is perfect. Good heavy stoneware."
3,Crashes all the time!,"I really enjoy this product and really helps my business.However, the software continuously crashes at least 3 times a day.If you are to buy this software, be sure make continuous backups and then save the backup somewhere safe!"
1,Is it really working?,"This can be a good product for a small company - when and if you can start it!The major problem is that it is very often very difficult to start. The program takes forever to start and usually freezes.Checking on the QB Forum, it seems that I am not alone. Intuit doesn't seem to answer the `why'question either.Since I am using a standard machine, one year old, with a lot of memory, I will say that it is time to use the remove button, eat the loss and buy something else."
1,Nothing But Problems,"This product is a waste of time and money. BEWARE. We used this database for years with several issues but were nervous to change since we had over 1500 customers input into it. However, now it is not working AT ALL. Thousands of hours of work are gone. This system is completely out of date. I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone. I will be looking now for a new database system."
1,Doesn't Work,"Bought the product, installed the product,the program will not load. Called customer service, they said they don't know what's wrong, but would research the problem and call me back. That was two weeks ago. NO word from them. The product may work fine in most computers, but their customer service is not."
1,Shockingly Bad-Stay Away,"I spent several years with the predecessor to this program only to have my database totally corrupted with no fix. Even when it works, it is painfully slow and crashes frequently. I tried the new version since I now have Vista. It is no better. Although it promises to work with Outlook, it apparently doesn't work with Microsoft Outlook Exchange. Every time I try to sync it just crashes. There is no customer support unless you are willing to pay their ridiculous prices. I've got seven years of data in there but I am ready to abandon it and re-enter the data in another program. Stay away. Intuit should be ashamed of themselves."
1,customer manager review,"I love intuit products, but I was extremly disapointed in this product. The only reason I didnt return this product is because it syncs with my quickbooks."
2,A Weak Attempt of Clark Terry,"I don't know why this was ever released. It lacks energy and Clark Terry is only showing his age. This CD was in 1991 I think, I saw him this year 1998, and he played ten times better than this CD, and that was in a wheel-chair. Clark Terry still swings, but not on this CD. Try ""Live at the Village Gate"" for a new Clark Terry album."
4,for school it must be purchased,"my son had a tough time to find this book, but it is good book, and for school it is necessary, so it is a must buy."
5,Why failed marriages are the key to love!,"A wonderful book that I wish everyone could read. Instead of seeing divorces as failures, they are steps on the road to realizing -- no, to EXPANDING ourselves into pure, unconditional love. Kingma explains why marriages/relationships really fail and how, as spiritually strong and independent beings, we can experience a more encompassing type of love. Relationships are ""a journey of self-creation"" where ""our wholeness is emerging"". ""The future of love is true love, a great, sweet love that isn't pain but joy, not small but vast, not personal but spiritual"". In the past, ""our marriages become watered-down versions of the values of society, instead of vibrant emotional unions that nourish the people within them."""
4,Function over Form,"Kingma's book is a breath of fresh air in that she asserts that traditional monogamous marriage isn't the ultimate form of intimate relationship; that it isn't a ""one size fits all"" relationship that everyone must aspire to. She outlines several different nontraditional forms that intimate relationships may take, each equally valid and suitable depending upon each person's individual needs and desires.I would have given the book five stars, but I had to wade through quite a bit of superfluous psychobabble in order to get to the core message of this book."
5,The Power of Love,"This book has profound insight and brilliance on every page. Your eyes will be opened to the higher power of relationships that Kingma shows is very real, and very possible. It is an essential book for anyone who has been in a relationship. A definite must read!"
3,A decent legal/suspense read . . .,"This is the first of Mr. Coughlin's that I've read. He has constructed a fairly simple suspense/romance story of a beautiful but ice-cold D.A. who, through a set of reasonably believable circumstances, suddenly finds herself on the bench as well as in personal and professional crisis. His characters are fairly two-dimensional even though he has tried very hard to give them all some texture. Hard to explain. Coughlin's story line, though, moves right along and there is enough tension and interest for the reader to stay with the book in order to see how it all turns out. I learned a little law in the course of reading it, and observed the unseemly political side of judicial work as well. It's worth a shot."
2,wrong item,"Please note: This is NOT the Brockhaus Wahrig: Deutsches Worterbuch in sechs Banden.The book is actually Der Brockhaus Wirtschaft.The Brockhaus Wahrig Deutsches Wörterbuch in Sechs Bände is quite a good German - German dictionary, comparable to the 10 volume Duden. It is,however, out of print."
5,ANDREW!!!,"This is one of my favorites of the early Blue Note series. Though the tunes aren't as memorable as on Black Fire, I prefer this session for it's overall chemistry. The performance of Joe Chambers is excellent. He has the intensity of Haynes, and sensitvity of Williams though is not as frantic as either. Both takes of Symmetry are outstanding. I just picked up Timelines last Tuesday and it makes me happy that Andrew is still making beautiful and challenging music. Can't get enough ANDREW!!!Is Compulsion getting a reissue?"
1,Another Gem from Andrew Hill,"Last year it was Passing Ships and this year another gem finally makes it to CD. This is an adventurous, yet melodic and playful recording. Andrew Hill was one of the best composers to emerge in 60s and he's accompanied by a sympatico crew. Bobby Hutcherson was a frequent bandmate and he makes his usual splash on vibes. Richard Davis was a go-to guy on bass and you'll here why on this recording. He provides excellent support and gorgeous solos. Joe Chambers on drums is another of this group's strong composers. Although less renowned than some of the other stellar drummers on Hill recordings- Jones, Haynes, Williams- he is more attuned to the music. And the bonus is the documentation of John Gilmore's ext-RA excursions."
3,A Roman Hole A Day,"This book was okay, but not necessary to complete your life or anything like that. Five actresses after roles in an upcoming production in Italy, one of them a scheming villain using sex and money to try and steal the parts from the other four.On the back of this book it says this is a roman a clef. Really? If this is a veiled reality, it seems that all that the actors Baker knows do is have sex with whomever and however, when not filming movies. Okay, then. In a way I guess when everyone around you is gorgeous you'd be a much more lustful person than most are. Maybe, perhaps, I don't know.The ""abnormal"" sexways were promising as per making a fun, campy read, but unfortunately were not developed beyond a few paragraphs here and there, since the majority of the book revolves around the comparatively ""normal"" sexway-having Madeline. More bondage, religious guilt, circle jerks and martinet lovers would have made this book ten times better."
1,"Plug end broke off, no response from AR","The first time I needed to move my equipment the plug going into the HD cable box broke off. I've had no response to my e-mail from Acoustic Research Customer Service.I read that as HDMI is digital, extreme cable quality is not required, with that in mind I got a GE HDMI cable for less than half the price and you cannot tell any difference."
1,Cheap wiring inside cable or no quality control,"Had this cable for a month. Suddenly my projector can't find hdmi signal. Of course I blame the dvd player. 3 dvd players later, still no signal. So I purchase another projector. Still no signal. Turns out when you bend the cable just right, the signal comes back. So it was a bad cable after all. The other reviewers are right, even in a bad cable, it's outstanding signal or nothing. I've purchase monster cable at their outrageously high prices and wanted to try something else. Guess I learned my lesson. Now 3 months later, I seriously doubt that the seller is going to exchange the cable for me. Monster has a lifetime, not that you would use it as I've had their cable for over 15 years. Now I know why I pay so much.Update the seller says I have to contact the manufacturer for warranty repair. DON'T BUY!"
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap",Do not buy these cables! After about 6 months the ends of the cable came apart (the plastic the covers the metal input tab). I bought two of these and both ended up coming apart.
2,faulty end fittings,After one year of use the end fittings on both ends came loose and now the cable has ceased working. I initially paid $85 for this cable from a big box store. Don't I feel like a fool! Interesting to note that the HDMIMM15 15FT HDMI cable by StarTech that I purchased on Amazon for less than $10 showed no less picture quality than this cable and is still working.
5,review of Larry the Cable Guy,"First time I've ever downloaded a video. This is hilarious! LMAO. Was very easy, even for an old woman. Love Larry. He looks just like my son or visa/versa. Enjoy"
4,Great information,"Almost all the legal systems we're familiar with come from either European or Asian roots. Further, almost none of us are familiar with what a real functioning Anarchy/Kritarchy would look like. Michael van Notten, in this book, shows us what it actually looks like. Simply what he shows us is worth reading.Not exciting writing, but great information."
2,Not a warm feeling movie.,The idea of the story was good.I just didn't get the idea of Christmas.Someone learning the joy of the season has been replaced by too much romance.It just doesn't have the joy Christmas movies should have for the whole family.
5,Wonderful gift - brought smiles to many!,"To begin with, the DVD cover was great - looked very Christmassy!Storyline was nice and had great, known actors in it. Quite reasonable."
5,A Holiday Romance DVD,"I received the DVD very quickly--very good turn-around. It was in excellent condition, as the seller advertised. Trust Amazon to supply a product we could not find in the retail market locally. The video tape we made from the original TV airing no longer works, and we are glad to be able to enjoy one of our favorite holiday movies again! The DVD is even a slightly extended version!"
2,Song of the Season,"I am sure the movie is good, but my copy skips all thru the movieand since I opened it, it can't be returned so I spent the moneyfor this and no movie. I put it in both of my dvd players and itskipped on both and I saw about 20 minutes of the 2 hour movie.So as far as quality of this movie I have to give it a minus one,because it skips thru the whole movie. JJC"
5,Touches your heart,This is a good family movie or one to make you get in the Christmas Spirit.When you need an uplift watch it any time of the year.Very rememberable and enjoyable to watch.
5,CHristmas Movies,Our family never tires of watching Christmas Movies and this is one we will enjoy in our family library. THanks for a great movie.
3,Rip off White Christmas?,"I am watching and enjoying the movie, but doesn't anyone see the direct rip off of White Christmas? Trying to surprise the old man with his old crew members and using an old time broadcast to do it? Waiting for it to snow for the holiday? Frustrating to say the least."
4,greatest hits vol 1?,"next to glen cambell, look no further than eddie as to the sound/style of modern country music. his body of work continues to be underappreciated for its impact on the crossover success of today's major country acts. like it or not, his success on country and top 40 widened the field for those who followed and captured listeners who never thought they'd like country music. this collection of hits belongs as a part 1 of because he had more essential tracks that could not be put on one disc. look to greatest country hits as part 2 until they decide to release greatest hits vol 2 on cd or the very least a box set with some live material."
4,Eddie Rabbitt- All Time Greatest Hits,this is a very enjoyable CD. I'd recommend this to any one interested in the oldies. I don't ever get tired of listening to it
5,Incomplete but great!,"As others have mentioned, this CD is lacking some great Eddie Rabbitt songs (Step By Step, You and I, Every Which Way But Loose) but nonetheless the songs that it does include are excellent. Eddie's sound varies from solid country hits to rock and soft rock, but they all suit him just fine. ""I Love a Rainy Night"", ""Drivin' My Life Away"", ""Gone Too Far"", ""Suspicions"", ""Rocky Mountain Music"", and ""Two Dollars in the Jukebox"" are all favorites of mine. A CD well worth owning, at least until a more complete collection comes out (if ever)."
3,"certainly not ""All Time Hits""","This is a decent compilation for an artist, in my opinion, is long overdue for a career spanning box-set to be released. As another reviewer pointed out, it is missing several of his better songs...personally I would have substitiuted ""You Don't Love Me Anymore"" for ""Do You Right Tonight."" But overall this is not a bad start or intro to the music of Eddie Rabbitt."
2,Sorry... next?,"Missing in action: Every Which Way But Loose (yes, from the movie), Step By Step, Someone Could Lose A Heart Tonight, You And I (with Crystal Gayle).Add what ""is"" on this disc: Suspicions, Drivin' My Life Away, I Love A Rainy Night... and it could be an awesome piece of work... (thumbs down!)By the way, as I write this, Mr. Rabbitt celebrated his 60th birthday (11-27-44).Thank you for the music..."
2,Not All Of The Best!,"This is a decent cd, but it is missing a lot of material. Does anybody know where you can find the Best Of/Greatest Hits II on cd? Does a cd even exist for that album? I know its available on tape. That album has all of Eddie Rabbitt's best work on it. Its much broader with 20 great songs that includes Step By Step, Every Which Way But Loose, and You And I."
5,Great product!,This bowl is so cool! Its unique shape adds character to the set. It's neutral color makes it easy to match other items. Great product!
3,This cd shows the greatness of Derek el at,"To say the least, Derek Smith is a great leader as well as musician. This will be the third cd I have bought by him and all I can say is that I want more, more, and more. Everytime I play one of his songs I know that I must be in another world. He is so cool.For this project Derek continued with the trio concept. This has to be my favorite style of jazz!This cd features a whos who in Jazz. How about the late Milt Hinton on bass? What a deal! Least we must not forget Bobby Rosengarden on drums. What a threesome!For this cd, the only reason for not giving it a top rating, was the repertoire. Some of the tunes performed here I didn't know or particularly like. Other than this repertoire issue, I thought this was a great cd.For you jazz diehards out there, do yourself a favor and by this cd."
1,Home Renovation Checklist,"Home Renovation Checklist: Everything You Need to Know to Save Money, Time, and Your SanityThis book has some common sense Q&A; in it, but it is not specifically a ""checklist"" that I was hoping for. So, if you have never done any renovation before, it's a good way to prep yourself for unanticipated issues. However, if you have any idea at all what you are doing, then it doesn't really give you a summarized list of anything.Three years later and despite many opportunities to reference this book, it has failed at every turn. Not sure who would need/use this. It's on the way to the donation box."
5,A Field Guide to Buying Organic,"This book has been SO helpful in deciding which foods are worth buying organic and which ones you can safely buy conventional. I was planning on switching to all or mostly organic, but my budget just woulnd't have allowed that, so I picked up this book at the library to help me decide what to buy. For example, I'm going to keep buying regular skim milk because there were nearly no presticide residues found in it, but because pesticides hold in fats, there were a lot found in whole milk, cheese, and butter, because of the fat, so I plan to buy those organic. It also made me realize hormones in milk and meat were probably not as much of a problem as organic advocates would have you believe. I plan to buy organic fruits and veggies, and I'm still deciding on meats. These authors don't recommend all organic, but they don't seem to be in the pocket of the big farms OR the organic growers. They form their own conclusions and opinions. Great and helpful book."
2,More confused than before,"In the attempts of the authors to provide an unbiased opinion of Organic foods, they created a book that seems to contradict itself. The beginning starts good as it describes the Organic movement and helps to decipher Organic labels. As you get further into the book, especially the chapter on dairy and milk you begin to get confused. The book atempts to explain the different pesticides, hormones and residues in milk but leaves you more confused about what is acceptable and what is unpreventable. The book completely lost me when it compared food items and tried to convince me that boxed Mac and Cheese with Yellow #5, Yellow #6 and tripolyphosphate was just as healthy as the organic version that did not contain anything artifically engineered. You can decide for yourself but personally I felt this book was written by authors who felt the need to buy Organic foods was foolish and not worth it."
3,Organic debate,This book is a great debate on the merits of organic food. Should I go organic or not? Why? Which products? Is packaged food truly organic? Pros and cons to both sides of the issue that will give you info to make your decision more informed. Also includes many companies that you can seek for your organic food. Well done.
4,Barbara Hendricks - La Voix si Belle,"This DVD gives us a special look into the life and behind-the-scenes workings of Barbara Hendricks- one of the worlds most enchanting (opera) singers. I appreciate that this DVD documents her rise to Paris fame from her humble Arkansas roots. She is truly a magnificent woman in so many ways, from her voice, to taking on formidable challenges with grace, to her beauty, to her visionary path, that I really don't know what to say... but this DVD gives us a unique glimpse into this Diva's stunning voice, mind, career, and mystique..."
1,Disappointing in many respects,"The designers of these speakers tried to skimp on cabling, putting form over function. The maddeningly short USB cable and interconnect cable between left and right speaker make it very difficult to stand the speakers up and align them without pulling them off their feet and knocking them over. Overall sound quality is passable for the size but the glaring deficiency in design overrides any other factors. I'm returning these immediately."
3,$39.99 at any Black & Decker outlet store,"Black & Decker outlet stores sales this right now for $39.99. Bought the 525 last week. So far, haven't put it together. Also bought 2 more for my Son-in-laws Christmas presents."
1,Workmate 525,I ordered the B&D Workmate through Amazon. When the package arrived it was in very poor condition. The box was beaten and gouged. Needless to say the contents were affected by the poor packaging and delivery. I tried twice to get replacements for the broken parts but both times the rep at Black and Decker sent me the wrong parts. My only option now is to travel 50 miles to a service center to get the parts which won't be available for another week. I have been trying to solve this problem for over 3 weeks now and still no resolution. I doubt that I will ever buy another B&D product again. Their service department is a joke - but not a funny one.
2,useable but very limited and surprisingly fragile,You'll be able to do some LIGHT handymanjobs with this apparatus. It will NOTreplace the use of multiple sawhorsesor even a small table saw.The knobs are really cheap plastic. Theylikely will crack.As a handtruck I haven't used it butlook forward to trying that feature.As a vice or table mechanism it'sstable enough to do light jobs.Now I use it as a fold-away arts andcrafts table in my study. I place abirch veneer plywood on top and useit as a kind of in-the-fie;d draftingtable.Sorry I could not be more enthusiasticbut it needs to be more sturdy withfewer plastic parts and less stampedmetal.
3,Black & Decker Workmate525,"If I had not had a gift certificate to use, I'd not order it here. Instead, after reading the other reviews, I'd get it at Target. As others said, I found it delivered in poor shape, left on my porch by Fed-Ex with top of box open, and several gashes on box into product. One clamp was completely smashed, and can't be used. The rest of Workmate is OK, surprisingly. Poor packaging and poor delivery."
4,interesting,"im listening to it now...and its not bad. its not like taking back sunday or thursday...im not quite sure what its like. maybe some franz ferdinand, modest mouse...i like it so far i guess."
5,CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!,I know this movie off by heart...i love it...its my absolutely favourite film. I can remember watching it over and over as a child. It always makes me feel good.
5,GREAT MOVIE,"When i was a little girl I would always make my mommy take me to the video store to rent this movie. Not only is it an uplifting story, but it also has great songs and dance scenes. The old-fashioned songs and people always warmed my heart and i was constantly singing along. One day a few years later, i was in the mood to see this movie once again and to my great disappointment, someone who rented the film had broken it, that day I went home empty-handed and crying. Since that day, I have wanted to see it. I am now sixteen years old, still a kid, and still yearning to see this great movie. It is a movie for all ages, and also a character for every person. All of the characters are so diverse that no one would ever not identify with one of them. This is one of my all time favorite movies, and I'm so glad that I finally found it and I don't have to cry anymore."
5,please put rags to riches on dvd,"I loved rags to riches tv show when I was younger. I had children and they loved the show. Now i want my grandchildren to watch it . It is a cute, funny and about family. it shows you don't have to be related in order to be family. I know several people who would buy the tv show on dvd including me. I hope that rags to riches tv series comes out on dvd soon It would make great christmas presents I have the rags to riches first tv show and its on vhs and it is starting to deteriate from so much use. My teenage daughters love watching it. I love watching it. So hopefully alot of people will help get this going"
4,"KAREN LYNN SCOTT, SHEMBECKLER GIRL","Karen Lynn Scott, who played Jodi, one of the Shembeckler girls , simply made the rags to riches girls realize how much more important she was to them in the film. They should of included her more in the film. Seeing her in that red pink bathing suit was the most amazing thing in the movie."
5,One great movie!,I saw this movie when I was younger and I began to search high and low for it as an adult. I finally found it and it's just as great as I remembered! It's a very sweet movie and the singing is great.(And I am definitely not one for musicals or singing in movies!). It's an enjoyable movie for everyone. My boyfriend even liked it! I recommend this movie to everyone.
5,I KNEW it!!!,"HA! I've finally found proof that I am not making it up! I loved this TV show and used to tell all my friends about it. None of 'em had ever even HEARD of it and one person told me, ""Are you sure you don't have your own SPECIAL TV that shows these things you make up??"" Well! I was vindicated when Battlestar Galactica came back out on TV, I've found the Peanut Butter Solution, and now this...Ahhhh...victory is sweet! :)Off to look for Small Wonder...that cute lil robot girl..."
1,No one should be fooled by the book title,"The book is not even close to what the title claims to be. The book is just for beginers, not for those who want solid knowledges for real battles. One thing that I can agree with the author is that options are the products designed for sellers, not for buyers, meaning that we as minors in the market should also consider selling. There were some remarks that were helpful in clarifying what I knew about options, but they were not worth the money I paid at all."
2,option selling,this book is really meant for trading in the commodities markets rather then then the stock market. Really little new for a stock option trader.
5,Fresh perspective,I recommend this book to anyone considering trading options whether from the longside or shortside.The authors dispell several myths that have been perpetuated by brokerage house over the years. loaded w/ alot of info and makes a valuble addition to anyone's trading library.Def worth the time and money.
3,Review of Options Selling,The book is fairly good on Options but does not spend enough time writing about stock options. Too much time on commodity trading. Still in all it is fairly good on options in general
5,Great for Beginners,"I trade stocks currently and have traded options & futures previously. This book does not address the stock market but does present an approach for investing in futures options that differs significantly from what I previously encountered in the futures market. I can see that my options and futures trading would have been much more satisfying and profitable had I used the principles in this book. I remain a neophyte in the futures market but will again enter with my eyes wider open this time, and I will probably employ some of the ideas stated within this book."
5,Confusion on ordering more Hornblower DVD movies,"The 6 DVD movies we have viewed over the past week are excellent . We want to order more as these are of excellent quality .Not sure if there are more we have not viewed yet .Boxed set of four included ( The wrong War ,The Duchess & the devil ,The fire ships ,The duel ). The set of two (Duty & Loyalty ) is marked as the new adventures .Are there any ones I have not ordered yet ?I believe there may be two more I have not seen yet ."
1,retuened item. Incorrect size,I was very happy with the service especially after having to return the item twicea. I am not sure as to the size I need but I ordered a size 10 then a 10 1/2 but the width needs to be wider. I have not decided to re-order as I am not sure the size 11 would solve the problem.Is there any way to get a wider width ?
3,Narrow with slippery sole,"The moc is very nice. However the size is not only short for an 11, but narrow as well. The double sole is smooth and slippery and I had to return them as I don't want my husband to slip and fall. I will research and order another type."
5,Work for me,"I have a fairly slim foot with a shoe size of 9 1/2 - 10 and often have trouble finding a good fit. After much review and pondering I ordered the size 10. The moccasins were a perfect fit in both length and width. There is no binding, or excessive tightness. The leather in the moccasins is rather stiff out of the box, but is rapidly becoming more pliable as they are worn. They appear to be sturdy and well constructed. I expect to get much good wear out of my pair."
4,"Sturdy, long lasting, good quality",I have ordered three pairs now for my husband in about ten years. They are high quality and probably the best looking slipper/casual shoes for men in the market. My only dissatisfaction is with the leather insole which separates and moves around inside the shoe and after awhile requires a special gluing - and expense - at the shoe repair place.
5,Heartwarming movie - great actors,"I have no new praise to add to what has already been offered. This is a great movie.Prospective buyers should note that the product details show a run time of 110 minutes. It was actually 94 minutes. Not a huge deal for me, but some people might object. Hallmark routinely shows run times of 110 minutes, even though their DVDs usually run 94-95 minutes."
2,damaged DVD,"Purchased this movie over a month ago. This movie is fantastic however I just opened it and watched it and there is a slight ding in the DVD so it skips over the damaged part, hence making it so a scene or two from the movie are missed."
5,November Christmas,This is a very heartwarming movie and I would recommend it to everyone. It arrived in excellent condition. Thank you.
5,November Christmas,Started watching this on tv but was unable to see the ending. Not a second thought once I saw it on amazon.
5,November Christmas,i really love this movie and of coures Sam Elliot! He is great in this movie! It will really touvh your heart.
3,"Some Improvements over previous game, but...","I bought this game thinking it would surpass the Beach Head 2000 game. I was greatly dismayed to discover that the game's only controller is the mouse. The joystick capability is not incorporated into the game at all. A big mistake. The mouse control feature makes one's hand grow tired after a few levels.While the terrain, vehicles, aircraft have been improved, the mouse is far more difficult to operate than the joystick, as in the previous game. Had they put the joystick feature option in the game, it would be a blast. Stick with the first game. I intend to raise heck with the folks that produced the game. Too bad, it's concept is a lot of fun."
4,This game is a keeper,"And cheap, too! I read some of the other reviews of this game and its really kinda sad, just because the controls are a little iffy doesnt make it a bad game. Even though the controls are just a little frustrating, they become tolerable and then almost make it more challenging and fun! It just proves that this isn't some action game you can just pick up and blow away all the bad-guys, you have to work at it and improve, and soon you'll be goin' into the millions point-wise..."
2,beach head 2002,"IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR WHAT MIKE MCQADE HAD TO SAY ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THE JOY STICK. I JUST PURCHASED BEACH HEAD 2002, AND PERSONALLY I'M DISAPOINTED.THE MOUSE MOVES IN WAYS YOU DON'T WANT IT TO, SCREEN FREEZES UP ECT. I'M JUST DISAPOINTED!!!!!"
