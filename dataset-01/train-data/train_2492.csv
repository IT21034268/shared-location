2,Alright shorts.... bad zipper.,The shorts are made of nice soft material however it is sewn kind of long waisted and the zipper is a joke I have seen tin foil that is stronger. I am afraid to wear these at work because you have to fight with the zipper to get it up and I am waiting for it to completly bust!
1,Sizing way off,"I purchased these shorts and paid extra to have 1 day delivery to have them in time for a vacation. Ordered a size XL, which should have been a perfect fit. Upon receiving the shorts, the inside label said size ""43-47"" and were way too large. I would consider this an XXL or XXXL. Beware the sizing on these!"
4,Great for any activity,"Very comfortable pair of shorts! They fit really well around waist and legs, though it could vary for everyones complexion. Cargo pockets are nice and roomy, though it's not something I like for the back, wallet pocket. The only detail I can see so far is that all over the piece there are loose threads everywhere, so it kinda makes you wonder if anything will just fall off, lika a button ar something. Overall, very good shorts for handy work, camping, grilling or chilling at home."
3,Gets old fast,"We have four from this series. This is my least favorite. After listening to it many times, it just doesn't hold up. It's still better than a lot of kids music though."
3,The book is ok,"I think the book is fine, nothing great about it, lots of information I think anyone can know by know, some crafts ideas are good but thats it."
4,A fine photographic collection,"Jill Caravan's book has some of the best photographs I have seen of lighthouses from all across the United States. It is a large coffee table book, which adds to the effect of the photos. What it does not have is much in the way of either information or history about the lights. Still, its a good book for lighthouse lovers."
5,"It is what it says, a picture book.",My brother bought me this book for Xmas. It's a good book to look at and does have some paragraphs of info. This book is not for finding lighthouses. I like to call this a coffee table type book. Its a nice book to have laying around for someone to look at. There are some very nice pictures.
1,Spool design is blatantly flawed. :-(,"The twine for this unit is flimsily wrapped around the inner spool. What this means is that while in use, the twine either spits out way too much at a time (wrapping it around the base, requiring down time to fix), spitting out none at all (resulting in a dramatic 1-inch cutting path), or sucking the twine back into the spool. Very poor design. Twenty minutes of weed eating cost me an hour. Forget the ease of lightweight battery power...this one is inherently flawed. :-("
1,Impossible to assemble !,"This trimmer is definitely NOT ""easy to assemble"". I'm a merchandiser and assemble large displays for my job. In addition to that I always assemble all items at home.The trimmer's handle clicked perfectly in place with the middle part. But when I tried to click the middle part into the bottom part, the bottom part split open (along the seam) and the middle part simply would NOT fit.After reading some of the other reviews, I'm guessing Toro changed the design of this trimmer. There were NO bolts to screw into ANY part. The instructions were simple, snap the bottom and top part onto the middle part (after stuffing the cord into the the middle part).Yes, the parts were angled, so it was impossible to attach them incorrectly. Even so, the parts did NOT fit together as they should.I've sent it back to Amazon and am waiting for a refund.(Received my refund from Amazon, thank you, I won't buy any more Toro products in the future.)"
1,POJ,this thing has to stay on a charger full time if you ever want to use it... and it doesn't have a trickle charger... so the battery becomes useless in 6 months... and a new battery costs more than the trimmer. It went directly to the free section of craigslist... now someone else can learn what I already know... LOL
3,"Does the job, but you get what you pay for.","First, I'll say I'm satisfied with this trimmer, given what I paid for it (not much). But... if you have a large yard, or are concerned about long-term quality, I recommend a higher-end unit. Although the trimmer arrived in only three pieces, for the life of me I could NOT assemble it - the top two pieces would not ""click"" together; I had to duct-tape them. The trimmer works well, but it's heavy for its size. You'll find your hands and arms getting fatigued after about 10 minutes from vibration and holding the on switch."
4,Easy to assemble,"Either Toro changed the design, or some of the other reviewers are mechnically challenged. Either way, the the trimmer snaps together in 2 seconds and is ready to charge. Couldn't have been easier.A detachable battery would have been nice for those who don't have outlets easily available where we store our lawn equipment.I haven't had any problems with trimming, it does a good job of cutting what I need. It probably won't cut through overgrown brush, but for standard grass and weeds, it works fine. The weight of the unit isn't bad. It's fairly easy to wield and flip over for edging. The biggest operation complaint is the safety trigger. You have to hold a safety button on the top at the same time as the power trigger during the entire opeation period, which leads to cramped hands and forearms."
1,Garbage,"I eventually smashed this trimmer in frustration, after the 10th time in one session that I had to mess around with the string cassette.The string cassette in this trimmer seems to have been intentionally designed to be as useless as possible. Impossible to load, no positive holding mechanism for the string, so it invariably spits out the last foot or so of string, and if you let it get a little too short, the string retreats into the housing.Based on my experience with this item, I will NEVER buy another Toro trimmer."
4,Essential guide for journalists,"Journalistic Writing: Building the Skills and Honing the Craft"" is an essential guide for journalists or for anyone interested in a journalism career. Robert M. Knight's book is a treasure of helpful information garnered during his long and diverse career as a journalistic writer, editor, and teacher."
3,"kinda cheap, not very quality build","The tambourine does not look as sturdy as in the picture, it looks and feels more like a toy. also, the cymbals feel too loose on the instrument. however, it serves it's purpose and makes a good beginner tambo for people on a budget. just don't expect anything more than that."
1,"Low quality, failed immediately, find another.",This charger blows a fuse in my car when I plug it in. I've had good luck buying inexpensive chargers in the past but this one is not worth buying.
3,hatching a tube,"Caravaggio from the `Glitterbox' is a good reference. The scenes are like places to sing where an audience could catch on. It's simple to say I know what's going to happen next, but it's also simple to say only some people should find a movie about Caravaggio simple. It puts the drama in di-o-rama."
5,Lamin Sanneh writes another brilliant work,"I have now read more than 5 of Lamin Sanneh's books and many of his published article's. Being a student of his at Yale, I was fortunate enough to learn side by side with a legend in the field of African history. Abolitionists Abroad is one that everyone must read. Sanneh writes in a clear and easy to comprehend manner that every book lover will appreciate. I highly recommend this book and others written by Lamin Sanneh including Translating the message and West African Christianity. I was fortunate enough to learn in the classroom with this brilliant mind, here is your chance to learn in your home. Five stars."
4,Dispelling Our Darkness,"""Abolitionists Abroad"" is an essential text by the brilliant Professor of History and World Christianity at Yale University. In this captivating book, Lamin Sanneh documents the little-known contributions of American Blacks to the making of Modern West Africa. Highly recommended for correcting our understanding of the mission of African Americans who worked to abolish the slave trade and for dispelling the darkness of our ignorance about the developing world. Available through Amazon Market.Roger E. Hedlund, PhD, Chief Editor, the Oxford Encyclopaedia of South Asian Christianity, Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2012."
4,It started here...,"With ""the fishin' song"", now my husband who has never been a country fan is hooked. I've been listening to Brad Paisley for a while and think he's an incredible artist who just keeps getting better. This one is from a few years ago, but is great. Can't wait for the greatest hits - but they are all wonderful."
5,...:::Blink:::.. Gosh!,"Brad Paisley always has and will be the best country singer! Disagree with me? Well, too bad! because its true. This CD is the best album of his career so far, hopefully there will be many many many more! Oh yeah, and also dont listen to any one if they say anything but ""wow"" to this album. THey are just jealous that THEY cant sing this good"
5,The sequel beats the original,"One of the most talented musicians and song writers in music today strikes again. Brad Paisley has surpassed his previous effort with his latest album, Part II. In typical style he blends fun, uptempo songs with some of the most touching ballads you will hear. From the title track, Part Two, to I Wish You'd Stay, you can hear the feeling in his music. But to show his depth of talent he has Two Feet of Topsoil that is just good old fashioned ten step country and You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive and The Old Rugged Cross showing loyalty to his roots. I highly recommend this to anyone who liked his first album or anyone who enjoys PURE country"
2,Missing a clear final objective,"This book is in fact a series of tips and/or techniques but the reader will never see where the author tends to drive him. Each article starts with a very small (and partial) picture of the target but at the end of the explanations, no review of the final result. No global project as it was supposed at the very begin of the book. That's a pity.The comments, in other hand, is sometimes missing details and precisions.This book did not give me any confidence to try any of the explained techniques."
2,Not worth it,"Not worth the money. There are some hit pop songs but frankly if you like pop, then you are better off buying their individual albums...at least then you can get a better feel for the artists involved. Overall, not the best choice for pop music fans."
1,"this isn't even for kids, it is for infants","If you are over the age of 5 this book will not appeal to you. Experiment after experiment it is the same cheesie concept from the same cheesie clown who is dressed to appeal to a 3 or 4 year old. If you want to put mentos in a coke and watch it spew or put a potato in both ends of some pvc and then push another one through it so that the first one pops a whole 5 feet then this is the book for you if not then pass, please save the time and pass."
3,information more useful than recipes,"This book disappointed me after all the good reviews. I have IC, but I am also lactose intolerant so I can't eat milk or cheese. Milk and Cheese are apparently staples in the IC diet, because the majority of recipes have some sort of milk product (without possible substitutions). The author also uses a lot of oil, which is inconvenient for someone trying to watch their weight. There are some good, tasty recipes like stews that are no brainers-they are IC friendly without milk that you can find in the ""joy of cooking"". There is however a lot of good information in addition to the recipes. There is an appendix that goes into details about IC safe brands of ""staples"" and which IC safe foods you can get your vitamins and nutrients from."
5,An Excellent Resource and Cookbook,"I love this book. Not only is it an excellent source of information about interstitial cystitis (IC) and the complex limitations of following an IC diet, it is also a great cookbook. (The Italian Baked Chicken is fabulous.) Recipes are straightforward and interesting. I refer to it again and again. The tone is sympathetic but hopeful, a great combination when dealing with this challenging condition. I applaud the writer for offering such a needed book."
4,Easy to use,"Easy to follow, but very plain recipes...but if you are on the IC diet already then you will be used to it and enjoy this book."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book was very disappointing. To heal from IC you need to heal the whole body and the recipes in this book are definitely not healing. Most of them contain ingredients like margarine, white flour, white sugar, and cream cheese - all things you should avoid if you want to be truly healthy. Salt water taffy is suggested as a snack and melted ice cream is actually recommended for pouring over pancakes at breakfast. The author appears to have no real nutritional knowlegde so don't waste your money (or further compromise your health) by getting this book."
5,IC Information & Cookbook,This book had information about how IC has affected the author which was helpful to me because I had just recently been diagnosed. There are many recipes which are tasty. She also has a nice selection of different ones to try. It helps to try the different foods and find out which ones are good for you.
5,A real treat!,"This group is very exciting! Clean ensemble work, inspired solos and imaginitive writing make the Newyorkestra a welcome new fresh face in the big band genre. The actual recording is very tight yet honest, in that the performance obviously doesn't rely on punching in every part. There is depth and artistic nuance which is often lacking in other contemporary big bands.Highly recommended!!"
2,A Considerable Disappointment,"The Acoustix can certainly sing when they want to, but this album is largely a waste of money. The eleven songs are ill-chosen, and several of them are stylized to the point of losing what attractive harmonics they would have supported. The total track time is only about 30 minutes; roughly twice that much music could have been recorded on the CD. If you love barbershop harmony as I do, you would do better to look elsewhere."
3,"Release ""unchained melody"" as a single to Oldies stations","The Acoustix are under rated and deserve wider recognition for their performance of ""Unchained Melody"" this version is like nothing you've heard before. Upbeat tempo fully instrumented with a driving bass. This song would have been top ten in the 60's. Any oldies format station looking for ""new"" oldies should give this song some exposure."
5,5 thumbs up!,"This group is by far the finest Barbershop Style Acapella group to ever grace a stage. If you are turned off by the word ""BARBERSHOP"", you need to listen to these guys. They vocally create so many overtones and undertones that you will not believe you are hearing ONLY FOUR guys singing. This particular package will also thrill you if you have any patriotism and love for the USA at all."
5,THE END OF THE WORLD,"I HEARD THIS ON THE RADIO AND IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED IT. THE SONG IS WONDERFUL BUT IS DEPENDENT UPON THE INCREDIBLE VOICE OF ALLISON PAIGE AND THE EXCELLENT MUSICAL ARRANGMENT TO BRING IT TO LIFE IN 2000. THE OTHER SONG, ""DO YOU EVER"", IS GREAT AND GIVES AN GLIMPSE OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM HER LONG AWAITED CD. IT IS A MUST BUY!!!! I SAW ALLISON PAIGE IN YORK, PA LAST WEEK WHERE SHE DID SOME SONGS FROM HER NEW ALBUM. HER VOICE IS EVEN MORE INCREDIBLE IN PERSON. THE PREVIEW OF THE NEW ALBUM HAS ONLY MADE ME MORE EAGER TO BUY IT."
2,Unplugged & Unfinished,"I'm always wary of CDs such as this, where you have to read the fine print to discover the performer. In this case, everything is performed and produced by Stewart Michaels. The content is generally OK, certainly not the worst Dylan covers ever, but they're far from the best. Good to hear some of Dylan's new ""Modern Times"" songs covered.Unforgiveable though is a truncated version of ""Tangled Up In Blue."" The version here fades out after only the third verse. The album is under 40 minutes, you'd think they could have included the full song. Or do another, shorter song... but don't do half a song!"
4,Little Dated & Uninteresting,Which it had more text to give it more of a lecture feel. I know quite a lot about the subject already and I just got it to see how someone else approached teaching the topic. Probably one of the best out there for a person just getting into the field. There are plenty of other texts that elaborate in greater detail about certain points but this is good enough of a start/foundation.
3,"Decent intro to spoken language, not useful for reading","This is a useful program for getting a basic sense of the sound of the Chinese language. It's based on the immersion model of foreign language learning, which means lots of repetition, visual cues, and no English translations. (You're supposed to make the association between sounds and pictures intuitively.) This makes sense in principle, as it's a bit like the way children learn a first language.But if you're interested in learning to read Chinese or understand how the characters work, this won't get you very far, in part because the program doesn't include a Chinese-English dictionary. For this, you might be better off with a good Chinese language textbook and a Chinese text reader / dictionary software package like Clavis Sinica.If you want a lesson-based program, though, with tutorials, tests, drills, and lots of pictures, this might be worth trying out, at least in the demo version."
1,Terrible,"Their approach might work for other languages, but for Chinese it's critically important to understand the grammar of the language, which Rosetta Stone never explains. It simply displays four pictures at you, with some incomprehensible (to a beginner) Chinese near them, and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures. I've taken Chinese for two years, and I still found it impossible to learn anything from it. I either knew the words already, or I couldn't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach.I would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a Mandarin college course, but I can't find anything like this for sale or free online."
2,Maybe not the best purchase,"Well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly, but if you're expecting to understand what the words actually mean...I wouldn't recommend this.I was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but I have no idea what any words in the sentence/caption actually mean.I've used it for a month know and I have no greater knowledge of Chinese than when I started...."
2,Not Up to the Hype,"I bought this based on all the 'good' reviews that i've read and quite frankly, i'm disappointed with the product.Yes, you can learn to guess what picture matches the phrase, but what does the phrase mean EXACTLY?Should a person who's trying to learn a new language make a GUESS? we're learning, we should not be guessing.Some reviews state that you don't get complete phrases until well into the course. i didn't get that far so i can't comment, but surely in the first few lessons, there are no phrases like ""what is your name ?""While the program certainly has it's positives like clear speech, good pictures, etc. i find the following negative points:1. no translation - geeze at least show us what the phrase means2. Slooooooowwwwwwwww loading of the lessons3. way overpriced4. no way to run w/o the cd, so make sure you don't scratch or damage it."
1,"Might be good, but how can I tell?","I've had this on order for a month now and shipment has been delayed twice. When I want to know why, some nice Indian person tells me that it's been delayed, didn't I get the mail. I have no reason to think it's going to be shipped in the near future. You'd think I was ordering the Gutenberg Bible or something."
2,Too much for too little,"I read several article on Rosetta Stone Chinese language software before I purchased it. My feeling was, you get what you pay for. Bases on this I paid for the expensive Rosetta Stone thinking that it would be better. I was wrong. It has no translations and no explanations of the text. The pinyin spelling has several errors and inconsistencies throughout. It does not even use a standard pinyin typing setup on the keyboard.If preferred, you can view the Chinese charaters. Again, no explanations, just pictures. Chinese charaters are not too difficult to understand if you learn the basic 214 Chinese Radicals.Personally, I learned more, quicker, from a free online course.Jerry Gelineau"
4,works very well,"I'm using the Buttkicker wireless system with a Sony subwoofer, and it works fine. Only downside is that, occasionally when we walk between the units and the signal is disrupted, a low-freq sound is generated by the subwoofer."
3,Did not work for me.,This system did not work for me. All I got was hum and noise. I am using a Yamaha home theater receiver so that may be the reason or it could be the plethora of other wireless devices in our house causing interference.
4,Good Solution for Wireless Subwoofer,I purchased this because I had to relocate my subwoofer. It works quite well. The only issue I had was when I walked between the transmitter and receiver. Relocating the reciever to a higher point resolved that issue. The two units are approx. 25 feet apart with a wall seperating the two.
1,Hair Dryer,The retractable cord has already stopped working...probably haven't used the dryer 10 times. It won't stay out!
2,Really Noisy,Hairdryer was really loud and didn't dry my hair any faster for the extra noise. I would spend my money elsewhere.
1,Beat up box and hair dryer blue not pink!,"I'm really disappointed that the box my hair dryer came in looks like it was run over by a truck! The picture of my product was pink, I wanted pink that is why I ordered it. The actual product is blue...not pretty! I don't know if it will work or not because it looks so beat up. If it doesn't I will return it! I was going to go ahead and wrap up the hair dryer for my granddaughter...then I notice a sticker on it. It is an offer for a free travel case...IT EXPIRED IN 2008! You sent me a piece of four year old JUNK... the box had been torn and taped back up. I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON for sending this out!!!! I thought I was getting a new hair dryer! I'm going to return it!!!!! And I may never buy anything from here again!"
4,Watch that cord!,"The dryer worked great. Heavier than I'm used to. I followed the directions when retracting the cord the first time:(to hold the plug end in one hand and push the retraction button with the other), but the button wouldn't press down easily, so I let go of the plug end to use 2 fingers to press the button (and cautiously turned my head away just in case). But the plug end whipped around and clobbered me in the face anyways, so watch that feature."
2,Worked great until....,"I bought this hair dryer about a month ago. It worked great! Dried my hair quickly with no problems. Then one day, I plugged it in to use it and nothing happened. The hair dryer wouldn't work. I pressed the reset button and tried everything. Luckily I kept my old hair dryer (a Revlon) just in case! I would not buy this product again...I contacted Conair a week ago and they said I'd hear back in 3 business days...haven't heard anything yet. Very disappointed."
3,Loud hairdryer,"I placed this on my wishlist and it was purchased for me for Christmas. I love the color and the cord keeper, however it is very very loud on any setting."
1,Too loud! Ion damages my hair.,"I purchased this dryer at Target for $20. I use only Conair dryers, and know that it is a matter of trying until I find the right one for me when the old one dies.This one is so loud that it hurt my ears. I know that I could have gotten used to it, but decided that it was best not to try.I have thick and fine hair and for some reason the ion dryer really zaps my hair- diminishes the shine.This dries quickly and thoroughly, but the noise and damage to my hair are not worth it. I will go back to a regular Conair.I love the brand, but just not this item."
3,Quite heavy,I bought this hair dryer last week; it does dry my hair much quicker and I like that it has 3 heat settings - including 'cool'. But I will be returning it as it is very heavy and the cord isn't long enough.
3,"Decent, but not pink","This is a decent little hairdryer for the cost. But from the picture, I thought it would be pink. It's not pink, it's red."
3,NO DIFFUSER,"I was buying this as a gift for my sister-in-law and she has thick, curly hair that really requires the ceramic-ionic technology. She also wanted one with a cord keeper and I was excited to find this model that seemed to have everything she was looking for at a reasonable price, but when it arrived and I looked at the box, there wasn't anything about the diffuser that is listed in the product description. All that is included is a concentrator, which is exactly the opposite of what my sister needs. So this is going back and I'm back at square one with a very limited amount of time. At least Amazon has a good return policy!"
2,"As usual w/Conair, the cord is massively too short","I just bought this hairdryer. It's a great dryer - nice design, etc, but I'm returning it. Why? Because if you're using a normal plug at the bottom of the wall, and you're 5'5"", or God forbid, taller, then the cord is simply too short. For some reason Conair always makes their hairdryer cords too short. I literally have to crouch to dry the top of my head. Why on earth do they go to the trouble of making a good dryer and then chintz on the cord - an extra foot would be the difference between me keeping it and loving it and me returning it, which is what I'm doing!Conair should go into the table making business - they could make dining room tables with 2 foot legs."
3,heavy,"I bought this dryer at a local store, and 3 days later am packing it back up in the box to return. I really like this dryer, but man is it heavy!!! Too bad, because my hair looks great after using it. Although I really like the cord keeper feature, the cord is too short for me. I like the heat this dryer blows out, but often it gets too hot, so if I have a necklace on it burns. If it wasn't so heavy, I'd keep it."
4,Noisy but alright,"Does what it's supposed to, love the retractable cord, I dont really care about the color, inexpensive, but really loud. Oh well, can't have it all in life. Overall, it's a good product."
3,Watch the retractable cord!!!,"I would have given this a better rating, because the dryer performs just fine. I especially like the variable speeds and heat settings.CAUTION: Be careful when pushing the cord retraction button as it will fly wildly about causing a risk of getting socked in the face with the oversized safey plug."
4,Great Dryer for the Money,"Overall, love the dryer. I do wish there was a hook for hanging and ultimately would love to see a medium heat setting. The dryer really does make my hair shine! Good deal for the cost and the retractable cord is a a lifesaver."
4,A goo replacement,"I had a Conair from years ago that was on its way out so I decided to buy another one. It is very efficient and powerful and I love the cord keeper feature. I thought the opening was a little larger, but other than that, so far so good."
3,"Not spectacular, but I like one of the features","Not so sure it's better than my old out-dated hair dryer in terms of drying ability. The ionic shine feature doesn't really do much, either. At least I don't notice a difference. The cool blast? It's slow in coming.Where this product shines is the cord keeper. I think the cord could be a little longer, but for the convenience of quick rewind, I'll take it."
5,Just as good the second time around,"This is my second 209R. When my first one finally expired after around five years of daily use, I knew that I wanted another just like it.This dryer is wondefully efficient, lightweight and has the cord-keeper feature that makes it very easy to store.Very highly recommended."
3,My hair seems limp after using....,"I've had two hair dryers in the last 27 years so when I had to buy another this weekend I wondered what all of the ""ion technology"" stuff was all about...well...I'm not sure I love it. My hair is long and fine and I had to use three times the amount of root lifter to get my hair to do anything; pretty much it's just plastered to my head!The other thing I did not like was that the buttons are right where my fingers go so I kept hitting them and changing the settings as I was drying.A PLUS is that even though my other dryer was 1875 watts this dryer seems much more forceful and it dried my hair ""over all"" very quickly without getting super hot. I'm sure the dryer is much better for my hair than my old dryer, but I just can't take this limp hair!I'll update in a few days, maybe it was just a bad weather day...."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Fairly shoddy construction, I had my previous wallet for 4 years before it started falling apart, I've only had this one for about 2 months and it's already starting to come apart."
3,old school death metal,"Ritual Carnage bashes out some ferocious, mid 80's style death metal. Complete with cheesy song titles (ie ""succumb to the Beast"", ""Metal Forces"", et al) and even cheesier lyrics, the songs eventually start sounding alike and rushed. along the way though, tracks such as ""Servant of the Black"" and ""Domain of Death"" rips along with Possessed/Keator influences and with lots of energy and seemingly with tongue in cheek. If you like old school death (ala Destruction and Celtic frost, then this cd is for you. Also of note is the good, solid production, especially where the guitar solos are concerned. They cut through the thick production with lots of clarity and sharpness. You could do much worse than this, so buy and enjoy!"
5,"Best gate out there, period","We went through 4 different gates for top and bottom of stairs before we got to this one. This gate was the cheapest out of them all, but also the best. We connected it to our banister with the Kid Co kit so we didn't have to drill into the poles. In fact, we liked the gates so much we replaced the Summer Extra Wide walk through gate from our family room to dining room with yet another Evenflo gate. Not to mention the wood looks great...and our daughter shakes the gate and tried to climb on it (she is not successful of course...) And it is safe and secure. I like the way it latches, I don't question its safety like I did a few other gates with a little lever securing them. A++++ I highly recommend it!"
2,Sent this back,Usually installation projects are a snap but this did not fit into that category. I got started and then when I realized what I was in for I quickly packaged this up and sent it back. You need to cut wood to size and then it still did not fit with my pressure mounted Kidco as I had read it would.
2,Call me crazy i suppose.,"I must have been completely on a different page with this system. I thought i was getting a gate for the top of my stairs.... Not just hardware to add your own gate to. This is only merchandise that wraps around the banister it does NOT include a gate. I guess its my fault for not really understanding what i was buying, but this for 35 dollars and no gate included? 2 stars because i guess it serves the intended purpose but in my opinion is does NOT state clearly enough no gate is included."
1,Complete waste of time and money,"I will NEVER buy another product from Kidco. The instructions for this adapter are completely useless. And even though it says ""No Drill"" all over the box, you find out when you try to install it that in fact you DO have to drill screws into plastic pieces with no pre-cut holes and crummy blocks of wood that insert into the plastic. Of course the worthless directions don't clearly mention that. And the instructions for the gate that goes with this adapter are even worse! Unfortunately, I can't return either product and will have to throw both into the trash. Terrible company and terrible product."
4,Shoddy Packaging/Missing Screws,"We purchased two of these kits for a double-banister stairs opening. One kit was fine while the other had obviously been returned and re-sent to us. I was disappointed that all the screws and hardware were loose in the box and two screws were missing. All the mini bags that should have contained the hardware were still in the box, but all were ripped open by whoever received the kit before us and were all empty. No attempt had been made to reseal them. There was enough extra hardware between the two kits to make up for the two missing screws that were not rattling around loose in the container.The functionality of the product deserves 5 stars, but I was not impressed with the company sending out already opened goods with damaged packaging."
4,"Really nice, but takes time","We bought this along with the KidCo Gate, and have been very happy with it. it is sturdy and works well both at the top and bottom of our stairs. The only problem that I have with it is the installation instructions and time of install. This is definitely not a 30 minute project. When you put this and the gate together at the same time, you can expect to spend at least an hour, possibly 2, depending on how handy you are. It was a pain to put together, but now that it's together, I am extremely happy."
2,Make sure you have enough space around your newel post,"The instructions for this product suck but it's sort of a commonsense type of installation anyway. Upon opening and beginning installation procedures, we realized that the newel post is too close to the next baluster/spindle and the entire installation kit has been rendered useless!WARNING: Must have at least 1.5 inches of space next to your newel post in order for the bulky plastic clamp in this installation kit to work. I would just take out the spindle, but then my toddler could just crawl through the sizable hole that would be left in its absence which would defeat the whole purpose of having a baby gate on the stairs.I felt kind of stupid for not thinking about how much room might be needed next to the newel post before I ordered the product, but I didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake. Measure how much room you'll have for the clamp before you buy this kit and waste your money like I did."
1,Poor design: all parts not included,"There are a limited number of products that allow installation to a round post. However, I was disappointed by this product on multiple levels. 1) we have a round post and therefore need the round adapter for both the top and bottom bracket. The kit only comes with one, and to order additional parts requires $5 for shipping and $5 for another round adapter. The form is not on line and requires that you mail in the form to order. (so who knows how long it will take to actually get them) 2) the screws did not fit the brackets well and as a result were prone to stripping. We definitely stripped one while trying to install and had to buy a replacement. While we do not do many home improvement projects, the instructions were half a page without any helpful pictures or references.Overall, we needed this product to install our gate without drilling into our metal post, but the additional cost and lack of instructions were frustrating."
5,Works great,We needed a way to attach our gate at the top of our stairs without damaging our large end post baluster. It works great and feels very secure. We will appreciate it also when it's time to take down the gate because we will not have to fill and paint screw holes in the baluster.
5,The perfect part for newel post gate installation!,"First I purchased a top-of-stairs gate that was to attach to my woodwork without damage. I found that the gate hinge was too tall to install under our banister AND it required that I put holes in our wood - so I bought this kit (and a shorter gate). The kit is just right! There are no holes in our woodwork, I could trim it to fit under the banister, and I installed it myself quite easily. The kit also made a secure connection, so there is no wobbling. I immediately bought another kit to install the first (too tall) gate on our back stairs without damaging our wood (and threw away the pieces that came with the gate). And, by the way, installing the gates is a lot harder than this kit! I definitely recommend this product."
3,Installation wasn't as easy as we thought,"We purchased this installation kit to install the Kidco top of stairs safety gate on the second floor of our home. We didn't want to use a pressure mounted gate because there is a piece of metal that sits at the bottom opening of those gates that could be a trip hazard.We wanted to install a secure gate without drilling holes into our stair post. Once installed, the gate seems to be very secure, but it was not easy to install. The problem is that the wooden slates and hard plastic pieces do not have predrilled holes. The box says no drilling, but they are only talking about drilling holes into your staircase post. The wood slates that are included in the kit are extremely hard to drill through. We had to take a trip the the local hardware store to buy a new 5/32 drill bit to get through the wood. It took well over an hour to install the kit. The company can improve this product by pre-drilling the holes."
4,"It really is a great product, but the instructions suck","It really does what is advertised. It allows you to install a child safety gate (purchase separately) on your staircase without having to drill in to the banister! I really didn't want to do that and permanently damage our banister, something that's not easy to repair or replace.The instructions are terrible though and must attest to the probable fact that it's made in a foreign country. But after some research and thinking, we were able to figure it out. As a product, it gets a 5 star rating. The only reason it's getting 4 starts from me is because the instructions for installation needs to be re-written."
2,Missing parts in the box,"I think that this product will work great once installed, but unfortunately I ordered two (one for each side of the stairs) and one box had incomplete parts in it. Start again... return and re-order. Poor quality control on that point."
1,Did not fit our large square posts,"I saw that this fits ""all gates"", missed the part that reads, ""The hardware is designed to fit square posts 2 1/2in - 3 5/8in wide"". Our posts are wider than that, so the installation kit will be returned, and we still have no good solution for our stairs."
2,A bit misleading...not a gate,"I should have realized I guess by the price, and I also should have read more reviews. But sometimes I get in the shopping zone (that day it was baby-proofing) and I purchase things a bit hastily.This product is NOT actually a baby gate for stairways. It is a kit to help you install a gate you have purchased separately onto your stairway. It is designed so that you can install the stairway gate (again, not included) without drilling into or otherwise messing up your banister and posts.I probably will end up using this product, it is a good idea and I already own it, but I don't want to use it with the gate I currently am getting ready to install. But I have several to install and I haven't bought them all yet, so I will look for one that appears to work well with this device. But I do feel a bit misled."
3,not for an iron banister or stairway,"This set seems really good, although i cannot rate that because we did not get to use it-This piece is not good for an iron banister. The attachment is made for a thick wooden banister, or just something thick in general."
5,Easy install,"This was exactly what we needed to allow the baby gate to work at the top of our stairs. We actually purchased a second one to use at the bottom of the stairs, because of how great this first one worked. If you are looking for easy install and to save your stair banister from permanent holes, definitely purchase this kit."
4,nice item,"the installtion was very easy, only a couple holes to drill and screws to put in. my only slight issue is that i wish the wood piece was both a little shorter and painted white like the rest of the gate."
5,ARRIBA COAHUILA Y SU CUMBIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bueno yo soy de San pedro de las Col. y radico en houston, pero como quiera yo tengo este cassette y esta perron, son mis artistas favoritos porque tocan buenas cumbias,tienen ritmo y llenan cada baile, yo quisiera que ellos tuvieran mas reconocimiento ya que se lo merecen porque le echan muchas ganas especialmente ""el dimas"" ojala el que compre este disco le guste, mi cancion favorita es la de ""pachuco"", eso es todo, gracias."
4,Jennifer Fallon,"Jennifer Fallon continues to provide a robust and entertaining world. Each book in the series simply wets the appetite for MORE! I'll be sad when I read the last book, because there isn't another after :(Sam"
4,"Good, but not perfect","It seemed to lag at times and the characters didn't seem to flow as well the whole time. On the whole this is still a very good installment in the series and the authors ability to paint her picture in your mind is quite good. I enjoy the fact that the bad guys are not just warped and twisted, but at times just so caught up in their beliefs that they go too far. That is a nice use of real problems with humanity."
2,More to Dislike than Like,"I bought this trimmer because of the 24 volt rating. Unfortunately, 24 volts doesn't make up for the overall poor design of the tool. This trimmer is so long that I have to keep my elbows bent when I'm using it and I'm 6'3"" tall. This is very fatiguing since the unit weighs almost 13 pounds. The motor is powerful, so why did they use .065"" string on it? The string appears to be a cheap grade and doesn't hold up well when trimming. You might as well not even try to edge with it. The changeable string length seems like a neat feature at first, but I'm not sure why I'd want to trim 8"" in stead of 10"". The instructions weren't very helpful in this regard either.Pros:Powerful, string seems to turn at very high speed.Cons:String is too small for heavy trimming or edging.Trimmer is extremely heavy.Difficult to assemble guard.Awkward to hold."
3,"Toro, I don't like the way I was spooled","Considering the size, weight, and ease of use I really like this product. The problem: the line and spool is really light weight. The line breaks just cutting grass by itself. There is an adjustable line cutter 8"" & 10"". This measurement is misleading. If you extend the line and start the measurement at the end, then rotate the spool 180 degrees and measure to the end, you have 8 or 10 inches. It is actually about 4-5 inches long. The problem is the line breaks after about ten seconds; you then need to advance the line by tapping the spool. Well it does not work well. I have to stop and manually push the spool with my hand to advance the line. A real pain in the wazoo. When the line runs out I will try a thicker one to see if that works better."
3,"Great, but a bit heavy and bulky","I was really excited after reading all the reviews, so I decided to get one for myself. To be honest, I am a bit disappointed after my first use since it definitely was not designed with short person in mind. I am about 5'5"" and it takes a lot of lifting to keep the trimmer above the grass. It was even harder when tried to use it as an edger. When using as an edger, the spool wire seems to wore out rather quickly and I keep have to switch back to the trimmer mode to tap it to extend the wire to continue."
5,Great!,"This is my first trimmer. But, its great. Incredible power, very solid feel, and quiet (which my neigbors appreciate).As the other reviewed noted, it IS fairly heavy, but not uncomfortably heavy. I just attached the included shoulder strap, so that may help. But, the extra weight is due to the fact it contains a 24 volt battery - which means - after an hour of trimming, this thing is still buzzing.The wall mount holder/charger is great! Nice touch."
1,Wrong product. A waste of time because of Amazon's mistake.,The product advertised was a battery powered weed wacker. What arrived was a kid's shirt. Bad error on Amazon's part.
4,Battery warning,"I've had my trimmer now for three years and love it. I made the mistake of keeping it stored all year on the wall mount...which is also the charging unit. The manual tells you NOT to do this. My battery now barely holds a charge, so it will need to be replaced. I searched the internet and discovered it will cost me about $75 plus shipping to get one (the manual tells you to get a dealer to install it, which would be an additional cost). I think I paid about $120 for the trimmer, so that makes it a tough call. Overall it has been a reliable, convenient and useful tool.The edger feature took a while to get used to, but the metal guard works as a guide for this application. Just set it into the edge and run it along the line you're cutting. Works great once you establish the edge a few times. I also went to a heavier line which seemed to keep it from breaking as often."
1,Disappointment Galore,"The sizing is all lies!! I ordered a medium pair- supposedly able to fit women's size 6-10. I got the socks and it is wayyyyy too big! I'm a size 9, and this was colossal! The knit was also shockingly scratchy for having such a high synthetic fiber content- it has all the scratchiness and discomfort of poor-quality 100% wool! The seam at the bottom of the sock along the toe is poorly sewn up, overly long and bulky; it protrudes into your foot when wearing boots and creates a whole other layer of discomfort along the balls of your feet, since the seam wraps around almost the the underside of one's foot, and actually underneath your foot when the socks are sized for giants. So bummed to have spent so much money that, as a broke college student, I really did not have on such disappointing socks that I now am stuck trying to bum off on some unsuspecting victim."
5,Highly recommend.,This is a wonderful and well-written book that tells the story of the people who make Santa Fe's economy. Highly recommend.
3,good old book,"The first half of this book is a very good and detailed history of the early record business. I thought I knew a lot but I learned a few things. For example, Edison invented the phonograph (which played cylinders) and Berliner invented the gramophone (flat discs), and Americans continued to call any kind of record player a phonograph. The reason for this, I learned, is that the trademark ""Gramophone"" disappeared from the USA around 1900 as a result of lawsuits over patents.About halfway through the book, however, the author makes a glaring error, confusing Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, and in the second half he is writing about his own era of the 1960s and '70s, when he was a record company executive, and has nothing much to say."
4,"Good product, needs better packing","Hi,This is a great product to send to a college student (need food, not junk) or as a gift for a friend or boss. I sent this to a friend and she was delighted with the gifts except for the fact that the jar of asparagus they sent in liu of mustard was unanticipated and broke during shipping. The products are good, but the lack of good packing made a mess of the gift basket. This may have been due to the fact it was shipped cross-country though."
3,"food above, board below","i ordered this for my dad for father's day- my parents said that the food was really good but the cutting boad broke in half the first time they used it. since the food was good though i ordered ""towering heights"" for some friends since there is no cutting board or anything, just food, and i'm waiting to see if they like it."
2,delivery error,I placed an order on the 4th of February. Only yesterday it was delivered. An error occurred when the address was given to UPS services. I noticed this error directly on the tracking message from UPS. I sent several emails to the costumer service indicating this error and trying to solve the problem as soon as possible. They took at least 3 days to answers my emails and only yesterday (27th February) the order was delivered.
1,"Good product, horrible shipping","This was ordered a week before Christmas, with guaranteed delivery by Christmas, but it arrive a whole week after Christmas. The company made no attempt to contact me or offer any explanation."
4,Giftbasket,"Great product! the basket was for a relative for Christmas, and they were very happy with the quality. The shipment arrived when the company said it would, and was in great shape. I would deffinetly order baskets from Wine country again."
5,Great Christmas gift,I got this for my Dad. The man who has everything. I was impressed with the presentation. He enjoyed the different snacks.
3,Baggage,"I love these things! But often the bags are not sealed, making freshness a big issue. Let the company know that the bags often unseal. Or find a different distributor of non-wheat sesame sticks."
2,where are the boobs?!,"I was expecting a lot more of this books pictures. You can hardly tell any of these animals are nursing! Only the first picture gives a clear view. The cats and pigs had no nipples in the usual 2 rows. The upright animals showed no breast. The human's nipple would have been way to high for the baby's position. The major one for me was showing the cow with no udders, that's so wrong!!If you're still nursing a toddler and wanting to read to them about it, you can probably handle seeing a little boob. I wanted to read this with my bilingual 2 year old who's still nursing but after the monkey he lost interest because you can't tell what's going on."
4,"Pulls you in, but then drags on.","Better written than many novels today and captures a flavor of yesteryear. The ending drags out a bit, but it is fun to see where the author takes you."
4,a mostly terrific psychological crime story,"'The Deadly Percheron' is a forgotten American noir classic written in the late 1940s. Told in the first person, it deftly weaves in paranoia/angst into a murder mystery ... very reminiscent of Cornell Woolrich and Patricia Highsmith. The story itself is complicated, involving the murder of an actress and a psychiatrist who was duped and later terrorized, but is never confusing. The author's prose is excellent. My only complaint has to do with the ending. Although plausible-ish, the author seemed rush in tying all the loose ends together. It seemed very much out of pace from the rest of the book.Bottom line: a pleasant surprise. Recommended."

2,Disappointing....,"...and rather misleading - the large quantity of addresses the author claims is due to the fact that a large number of people are ""lumped"" under a common address - for instance, all Olympic athletes, past and present, are given a generic address of the U.S. Olympic Committee, all members of congress are listed together, all members of a sports team are listed with one address, etc. Much of this ""information"" can be found for free on the Internet.The book is also poorly organized when compared to others on the market - a straight alphabetical approach would be easier to use. I returned this one day after I bought it - I've found the books by Mark Allen Baker to be better."
5,1L Must Haves,This is an awesome book for any 1L. Because of the nature of the questions a person must know the rule to be able to answer the question. Better for preparing for essay part of the test than the multiples section.

4,wrong dimensions,Overall quality of product is acceptable. However the size of the product is actually smaller than the dimensions listed in the item description.I was still able to use the item but this size differential could be a problem for some purchasers. Width x length is about 1-1.5 inches smallerthan listed.
2,Not Useful,"I was having trouble with my Vista based machine and wanted to figure out what was going wrong and how to fix it. I have purchased quite a few books in the For Dummies series, so based upon my previous experiences bought the book.Some people might find this book very informative and helpful, but I did not. The one takeaway I had was to purchase a program that would clean and repair my computer's registry.I went through a couple of highly rated programs to get my computer running smoothly again, but only when I installed Norton 360 was everything cleaned up. After I ran the repairs with Norton, I didn't have a use for this book.Now that Windows 7 is out, and Norton works on both Vista and Windows 7, I simply do not see value in this book."
2,"Watch out!, not the original singers.","If you are looking for the original soundtrack, this is not the one, and trust me, you'll feel the difference."
2,"Ug, I guess it isn't for my hair type","First, let me say, I have the Sunsilk DeFrizz Curl cream and the cream and gel combined, and I LOVE both products. My hair is naturally wavy and often falls into loose curls with little-to-no trouble. My goal in using this shampoo was to use it just for when I planned on wearing my hair in the loose curl style when using the mousse and/or gel. I've tried this shampoo twice and was not the least bit impressed with the results. Let me re-say, my hair is naturally wavy/board line curly and takes very little to get the cute loose curls everyone loves. I just wash my hair, let it dry naturally (no blow drying) and while still a little damp use the moose and gel, and BAM curls, cute curls, at that....but when I combine my old routine with this shampoo, my hair has an oily unclean look. It just doesn't feel as clean as with my other shampoo and it hangs limply; maybe it will work for you, but it certainly doesn't work for me."
5,A good book whether read seriously or for its humor.,"The Higher Foolishness is an amazing read as it covers ground from metaphysics to hard science with absolute wit. Its humor is its greatest asset and its greatest mystery as for the majority of the book it is hard to tell wether the author is seriouse or not and even while he is making an argument that defise logic in its claims, does so while giving the reader a sense of absolute reason, it is modern satire at its finest found in a book more than 90 years old!I also found it had some of the most interesting and uncommon quotations from a larger arrey of historical figures than I have ever come across in a singe book, a treasure for the history buff."
4,"Nice, cool, but not cold enough","Nicely built, lovely to look at, great built in beverage fridge. The glass door is beautifully transparent, the shelves adjustable and all items on them very accessible.The lowest temperature setting is 40 degree Fahrenheit but the temperature swings between 44 and 40 as part of maintaining the 40 degree base setting. I wold have preferred a fridge that goes as low as 34 degrees, since beverages will warm up when retrieved from the fridge. It runs quietly and is otherwise a great built-in."
1,Couldn't suck enough,"I have 1+ acres and wanted to breakdown a large piles of leaves. I knew right away this was not the right tool for the job as it took too long to get through a pile. After the filling the 3rd bag, the motor started to smoke, and that was it. I suppose this tool may work for smaller cleaner applications. In my yard, there was the risk of sucking up small rocks, and twigs."
5,The blower that really blows!,"For the frequent user of a blower, stick with the gas-powered one. I used a gas powered blower for 10 years on an infrequent basis. Mixing oil & gas, dealing with stale gas, and hearing loss are issues to deal with. I purchased this Toro 51598 electric blower about three months ago and have been nothing but pleased with it. The variable speed is a great feature for added control when ""sweeping"" out the garage. It's packed with plenty of power. It's far less noisy than a 2-cycle engine and it starts with a flip of a switch (every time).The one improvement I would suggest is making the cord clip a little friendlier for the 12-gauge extension cord. With the heavier cord I usually loop it through the handle. Not real stylish, but it works. Lighter weight cords are not a problem staying plugged in."
4,Better than gas,"I've been using a 2-stroke gas blower for the past 6 year or so, but I've been getting tired of the noise, the vibration, mixing gas and oil and in general all the fuss required to start and run it. About a year ago I found a Toro Ultra Blower at the yeard sale of a couple moving to Australia at a very attractive price, and I bought it.Much to my surprise, this light electric blower puts out a lot more air than my noisy gas blower- and it weighs a lot less, too. Trailing a cord as I work isn't that much trouble, and the lower noise level is a big plus, especially when I'm working in the garage, blowing out the dead leaves, dust, and other detrius that manages to work its way in.I only paid about a quarter of what this thing normally sells for, but base don how it's performed so far, the asking price seems pretty reasonable."
4,Great Value,"In addition to being a good blower and vacuum I find that the mulching factor is a big selling point. It readily picks up and compacts oak leaves/small sticks etc, reducing the piles to about 1/5 their original size. The metal impeller seems to be able to handle sticks, small dirt clods, pebbles etc.There have been some comments about difficulty in changing it from vac to blower but I found that if I spray a little silicone on the connecting parts it all comes apart/goes together quickly and easily.My only possible criticism is that the vac tube is too large to get into some small spaces. No big deal."
5,Great product,"I have used both gasoline and other electric blower vacs so when I received this I immediately wanted to try it out and compare it to what I had before. There was no comparison, the Toro was everything I hoped it to be, it felt like I could blow the leaves from the neighbors yard while standing in mine. What I liked was the variable speed control so that when I was around the shrubs I would not be blowing the mulch away. The vac picked up the leaves and chopped them without a problem and they will be great mulch come next spring. I compared and shopped and found this to be the best for all around use."
4,Nice piece of equipment strong motor good leaf pick up,"I really liked this model and it is doing what is expected. I bought another brand and the motor burned out doing exactly what I have been doing with this brand.Very happy I can keep going with my yard clean up and not experience any unexpected issues. One thing, I feel can be improved, is the leaf bag is difficult to remove for emptying."
4,as advertised,"Performs as expected. Plug it in, turn it on and air comes out. Nothing spectacular, but nothing spectacularly bad either."
1,Died During First Use!,"After about 3 hours of blowing and bagging leaves, the machine simply quit. My guess is that the power switch, which is a variable dial, failed. The blower would probably be better off with a low, medium, and high type switch."
4,"Great blower, not sucker","As a blower, this works wonderful, but using it as a vacuum doesn't work so well for me. I think if you have different leaves than I do (Live Oak) then it may be better. Of course if you just gathering a few leaves it works great, but in my case, I have 6 huge Live Oaks that drop a ton of leaves and it's just not feasible for me to use this for that."
4,Great! Until it burned up...,"My last Toro blower lasted like 20 years and it still works fine. I bought this one in late 2006 because it also vacuums but mostly for the variable speed.This unit has a warranty of two years and unfortunately after 2 years and 4 months of very light and careful use, mine started to burn up with smoke billowing out of the housing! You'd think I would give it zero stars and go with another brand. But no... I just ordered a new replacement model #51599. I did deduct one star as a penalty from an otherwise 5 star product.This unit is extremely useful for so many chores, I have found I can't do without it. The variable speed is a must. In addition to the usual leaf blowing, deck clearing, garage cleanout, etc., I use this to dry my cars and motorcycles after washing. Very handy item and hopefully I just got a dud. Time will tell."
1,very disappointed,"Initially was very pleased with the blower functionality. The vacuum mulched very well and had good suction for an electric, although the flared out vacuum nozzle left it prone to frequent clogs. The bad news, after only 1 and a half seasons of light use, it burned up - as in started smelling hot and by the time I got it shut off it was pouring smoke. Thought it might have been the variable switch, but on ivestigation found the fiberglass mount for the motor brushes completely burned up allowing one of the brushes to jam in the motor. Overall, really great performance the first few times you use it, but in the long run, a disappointing fire-hazzard."
5,Super Blower,"The Toro 12 Amp Blower has made yardkeeping a much easier task. The unit is lightweight and easy to handle. The best feature is the variable speed control which allows you to use the minimal amount of power(and lower noise levels) to complete tasks. My first blower was a two speed model. This unit is a tremendous improvement. I have not used this unit as a vaccum yet, but the metal impeller is a meaningful feature-plastic units break."
3,Toro Blower/vacuum reivew,"I like the weight of the blower, blowing capability and ease of use. However, I still haven't figured out how to use the vacuum. It looks a lot more complicated and inconvenient."
4,Thank God It's Electric!,"I am of the opinion that Gas Powered Leaf Blowers are the second most horrible invention of all time (after car-alarms). They are loud, horribly polluting, and just plain obnoxious.SO, thank god there's decent electric one out there now! Personally, I won't buy it anyway, I just use a rake - hey a little excercise never hurts. But I swear I think I'll start buying these for the people on my street who insist on those horrible gas ones - they ought to be banned!"
2,This Sucks,i have had my Toro Electric blower for about 2 years of light use. The reason why I hate this blower is because it is electric and it broke. The vac feature is something that should be avoided to prolong the life of this machine. And if you love extention cords get this blower.
3,"one step forward, two back","Pro: metal impeller. Seems like a better idea than plastic. I've had the plastic for several seasons and they wear down and that reduces efficiency. I've not had the metal version long enough to really know it's going to last longer, but I think it will.Cons: As a vacuum, I think they missed the boat by making the tube's intake end much larger than the motor end. Vacuum power is reduced from the straight tubes I've used, and is sometimes barely adequate. This could be fixed by including a 16"" optional end that remains a constant diameter. Also, removing the bag is more difficult on this vac than others I've had. It takes too much pressure on the plastic nubs to get them to release."
4,Works Great - variable power control broke immediately,"I had 2 gas powered blowers. Neither would start this fall so I scrapped them and went with electric. This blower is just as good as the gas ones. The vacuum works pretty good too. My only complaint is the variable speed control broke the first time I used it. It is no longer variable, just full blast."
1,Disappointed,"Product burned up the first time I plugged it in. The problem is, I didn't try using it for months after I bought it and therefore decided not to pursue returning for refund, etc.This is part of the inherent risk of online purchases for someone such as me."
3,Great blower...kinda sucky sucker...,Like I said...Great blower! I like the variable speed switch (although it's sometimes not that convenient to reach. Has awesome blower speed. Switching between blower & vac takes a bit of time. I found that even with dry leaves the suction nozzle easily plugged. It does have good grinding power though.
1,Motor burned out after only 9 months,I like Toro and purchase most of their products. When I purchased this blower in July of 2006 from Amazon I was extremely pleased with the unit's power and speed. I blew leaves off my lawn in 5 minutes and dirt off my sidewalk and driveway after edging. In May of 2007 I plugged this unit in and it started to smell like something was burning. Then the motor stopped and did not go back on. There is a two year warranty and I will bring this unit to the nearest Toro dealer for replacement but this product failed me. I'm glad they discontinued it.
1,Planned obsolescence! Barely used,"It began rattling & broke as soon as it was out of warranty. We used it a total of 5 different days--2days each in the fall for 2 years, & once in the spring. It did have a lot of power for an electric, though--until it broke."
4,"Big improvement over the prior model I had, and ........","the more powerful blower, metal shredding blade, and variable speed are all great, but this new model has pinch points to press in order to remove the blower nozzle that almost defy all human pressure. I almost had to break them to remove the nozzle. That MUST be redesigned by Toro."
4,More Power Than Expected!!,"I got this blower/vacuum recently, and i must say that i am very impressed......it is very powerful and it is lightweight......i cannot imagine needing a leaf blower with more power!! the vacuum/mulcher made short work of my pile of leaves........it really is a good machine, and at the price Amazon is offering it for, you can't beat it.......i love it and will get great use out of it......the only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that it is a little cumbersome when you are switching from blower to vacuum, and when i went to remove the leaf bag, the attachment was very tight and i could not remove it. this would not be a problem if you are a man, but being a woman it was a struggle.......other than that, i would say buy it........i am still glad i got it."
1,"The good, the bad, and the broken!","Toro has long been a consumer brand name known for it's quality products. The blower/vac I bought worked as advertised..... for a few days at least. The high speed went out after one week, the entire motor stopped after 2 weeks. When it was working the blower did a great job of blowing leaves, and the vacum shredded them just fine, cutting down the number of bags need by a large margin.I buy nearly everything from the internet and this is the first ""bad"" product I have recieved. Perhaps I was just due."
2,Unreliable,"Out of the box it was easy to use and quite effective. However by the third use, it would loose contact at the power switch (knob). Finally it stopped working all together. I have owned other Toro blowers and was disappointed at how flimsy the workmanship for the power knob is constructed. This feature would need to be corrected before I could endorse it. For the brief time it worked, performance was impressive."
2,Variable Control didn't last the first day!,"After reading all the other reviews it's my summary that when it works, it's good. Unfortunately my unit failed at what's obviously the weakest point, the variable speed control. If Toro could make this switch reliably, the unit would be great. Unfortunately the control is failure prone and the unit is unreliable."
1,Not Toro Quality. Don't buy it!,"Had this blower 2 seasons. Bought it because Toro is supposed to be one of the best and reviews stated same. I don't use it heavily, but I do blow the driveway in the summer as well after cutting grass. In the fall it gets about an hour's useage for leaves about 8 times. After cutting the grass today the motor began to slow down and smoke heavily so I turned it off and took it apart. One of the brushes burned up and the mount along with the board that holds them burnt up as well. Can't find replacement parts. If I wanted junk I would have purchased a $20 blower and thrown it away after the first season. Toro won't get my money again."
2,toro 5198 leaf blower/ vaccuum,"Im not too crazy about it, It works, but Im finding myself cleaning out clogs all the time. It seems to take more time cleaning it out than it does actually picking up leaves and pine needles. blower seems to work fine."
2,Unreliable Leaf Blower,"I purchased this leaf blower/vacuum in Dec 2002. I used in moderately that year and in the fall of 2003. It burned out today, Nov. 18th. I have three Toro products - this one, a gas powered lawn mower, and a cordless electric string trimmer. The leaf blower and lawn mower have been unreliable. The string trimmer is only a year old, so the jury is still out. The bottom line is that I don't intend to by Toro products again."
1,Worked great first 2 times & during 3rd use it died!,"The blower initially worked great and the mulching feature worked well, although it most certainly did not mulch the leaves in a 16:1 ratio...more like 3:1 for oak leaves. However, while using this item today for only the 3rd time and after only about 10 minutes, it completely died. I turned the knob, and nothing happened. This blower/mulcher did not get me through a single season's leaves. Very disappointing!"
1,OK ... while it worked,"2 years worth of leaf blowing and suddenly stopped working. We've only got a small yard, front and back, so it hasn't done a lot of work. Now it won't do anything. Poor workmanship, Toro, and I'm not impressed. Not particularly cheap either. Now I'm going to get rid of the piece of crap and buy a gas blower with more power and no cord to get in the way. Oh yeah, the vacuum/mulcher never really worked well - had to vacuum up leaves really slowly (take a few, mulch, then return to the pile) and it kept on jamming. I got a mulch ratio of about 4:1, better than some but nowhere near the 10:1 or 16:1 that Toro claim. Impeller kept clogging even with dry leaves. Let's face it, Toro ain't no Craftsman or B&amp;amp;D, but for this money you can get something better."
5,Just as advertised,"Works like a charm. Be careful if you suction up small stones...they can damage the magnesium fan wheel (my fault. Easy to use, powerful, light...much better than my Sears gas-powered blower (which, after minimal use, won't start)"
3,"Good,but not without problems...","The blower works as advertised no question there that it does the job... however, when you start the use the vacuum attachment you start to see some of the kinks.The good:1.) The blower works great2.) The vacuum picks up leafs and leaves other things like rocks behind3.) It's relatively quiet compared to some outdoor tools I've used4.) The parts are solid through and through (good construction)5.) PriceThe not-so-good (Not bad mind you):1.) The vacuum bag is a single strap like a duffel bag which can get heavy if you use this to vacuum up a lot of leafs. A back-pack design would have been great.2.) The vacuum bag is cumbersome if you are attempting to put the leaves into on of those double bag 30 gallon yard waste bags. The strap gets in the way and the zipper could be better positioned.The bad:1.) It is excpetionally hard to release the vacuum bag attachment, which I've found leads to a lot of swearing and cussing."
2,Didn't last too long :(,I used it about 10 times in 2 years and it did the job well. Used it as blower and mulcher and was pretty happy with the results. Unfortunately now it smells like burnt everytime i use it. I opened it up the other day and it looks the like motor collectors are giving up. Not an expesive tool but it should have lasted more than 2 years of light use.
2,"Given a challenge, it chokes","I bought the Toro for its supposed ability to vacuum leaves. Here in Florida, oak leaves rain down upon us this time of year, especially in older neighborhoods such as mine that are filled with beautiful oaks. The result was mixed: It handles oak leaves just fine -- although the 16 to 1 ratio that Toro claims for the machine's mulching ability must be a figure plucked from someone's imagination -- 2 to 1 maybe. The problem comes when something other than leaves, such as twigs of the tiniest type, or the pine nuggets often used for mulching in flower beds and under trees, are added to the mix. The Toro chokes on such a challenge, increasing the work for the user. The last time I raked leaves without the Toro, I filled 11 plastic bags. The first time I used the Toro, the result was 9 bags. Not much labor-saving in this device."
4,Toro is Thorough,"Works beautifully, both as blower and vaccum. Minor drawback is that conversion from one mode to the other is somewhat tedious."
1,The vac hose is a real bottleneck!!!!,I did not have a problem with the blower but the vac really sucked! The vac hose starts with a wide oval opening but then tapers into a bottle neck that quickly traps and stops leaves going into the mulching blade. I was so disapointed and returned the blower. They should redesign this hose.
4,Works well except hard to remove bag,"Suction and blowing both work well. Variable speed control very handy. When set to medium speed, still sucks up dry leaves well and doesn't make so much noise. Only problem so far is that once dust and dirt get sucked up into bag, the bag assembly doesn't slide on/off easily - it's very tight due to the dirt on it. I just don't slide it on all the way."
2,Not good as a vacuum,Although it has plenty of power it is extremely difficult to get the bag attachment off of this machine. Tried this unit with and without the universal leaf collector that was suppose to blow the leaves into a trash can. The universal leaf collector would not stay on the can and kept blowing off no matter what speed I ran the vac at.Bag attachment contact point needs tweaking by Toro.
4,We'd buy it again,"The impeller loosened up and had to be tightened but after that it worked just as we had hoped, used it mainly for vacuuming the fall leaves and it really did chop them small,dumped the bag right onto the garden space and roto-tilled them right in. Very glad we got the metal impeller and not the plastic. Not too noisy either, so would recommend this model to anyone!"
2,Dificult!,"After the lexion #3, is very dificult to find outwhat they mean with the pictures.Is not that good like they sayd,too much money for that!"
5,Rosetta Stone - Why bother with anything else?,"Rosetta Stone is, without exception,the best way to learn a language. It uses all learning styles (reading, hearing, speaking)to reinforce, and skips the very ridiculous step of translation. You learn the words and phrases directly into the language you want to learn. It is repetitive without being boring to reinforce each lesson. We have used other language books, CDs and DVDs, but we won't ever use anything but Rosetta Stone again."
2,"Very disappointed - no grammar, no vocab","Their presmise is that you ""learn like you did as a child"", which sounds good in theory, but in practice it isn't efficient for adults who learn better by understanding the rules and patterns of a language and have a vocabulary list to refer to. They give you nothing. You can download the english translation of the sentences but it is very difficult to figure out the mechanics of the language this way. I speak 3 foreign languages, and found this program useless by itself. After learning grammar and vocabulary from other programs I was able to start making sense of this package, so it was somewhat useful for practice but not learning. I recommend Pimsleaur or Linguaphone. The Immersion Methode and ""Tell me More"" programs are nearly useless as well."
5,"Useless on its own, powerful if used with other material","If you don't understand the Arabic alphabet, this will be useless. But if you get a dictionary and learn the alphabet, this is the best software you can get."
2,Whatever you do...,"...Wait for Production Studio CS3 which should be out July or Aug 2007. Encore DVD 2.0 is crap, and so is Audiition. Both of these get a major overhaul in the new version."
2,Wrong Aspect Ratios,"I was thinking of buying this set until I noticed the aspect ratios listed as 1.33:1. I checked with the IMDB, and both of these films were released in th 1.85:1 format."
3,ZZZZZ-ZZZZZzzzzzz,"I could barely keep my eyes open. This book was recommended to me. I liked the title, but the story was so long and drawn out. CeCe was just playing games. The charaters didn't seem real. It read more like a Harloquin Romance novel than a true black christian fiction romance. It didn't flow. Sorry. I cannot recommend this read."
4,Genesis House books 1 & 2,"While not ""exciting"" books, they are uplifting, because they remind us all that we should pray daily and often. Whatever their circumstances, the characters turn to God to help them, or they thank Him when things are going well. Those are both good reminders to us all.The books put me in a peaceful state of mind, because God is always near to the characters, where He should be to all of us."
3,A good story,"I couldn't say this was a great book, but the story was one I was glad I read. It definitely was an inspirational story and the author managed to emphasize Christianity without being preachy or unrealistic. The story line was well thought out, but it seemed to drag out for too long. For me, the characters, while likable, weren't ones that I found myself feeling invested in. I stuck with the book, more out because I wanted to see where the plot would end up, than because I cared what happened to the characters. I think it felt so long because the characters spent way too much time in their heads and we read the thoughts and feeling of both main characters about each situation. It was like reading every scene twice.Even though this is a first in series book, I don't think I'll be reading any of the others and I didn't even read the sneak peek of the next novel that was at the end of the book. I was just ready for the story to be over."
3,Single Mom's Drama,CeCe Williams learns the complications that accompany being a Christian with a past. She allows the mistakes and regrets of her past to prevent her from experiencing love. Instead she dedicates her life entirely to working and raising her son. However speeding tickets and community service force her to confront her feelings about love.
2,ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND,"IF THIS AUTHOR IS A CHRISTIAN, THEN WHY WOULD SHE ENCOURAGE ADULTERY? NATE WAS ANOTHER WOMAN'S HUSBAND EVEN THOUGH HE WAS DIVORCED FROM NAOMI. ADULTERY IS A SIN. BY HIM MARRYING CECE, HE HAS CAUSED HER TO COMMIT ADULTERY TOO. SEE MARK 10:11 AND LUKE 16:18. AND ROMANS 7:1,2,3. THIS LOVE STORY WOULD BE NICE IF ONLY NATE HAD NEVER BEEN MARRIED PRIOR TO MEETING CECE. ALTHOUGH IT WAS ANNOYING THAT SHE OVER DID MOST OF THE SEQUENCES. FOR INSTANCE, IF THEY WENT TO A BASEBALL GAME, SHE SPENT SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS DESCRIBING EVERYTHING! LIKE HOW HE HELD HER HAND AND HOW HE GAZED INTO HER EYES AND HOW DAVID LOVED HIS MASCULINE ARMS PICKING HIM UP, ETC. SO FAR, THERE'S ONLY ONE CHRISTIAN ROMANCE NOVEL THAT I READ THAT WAS SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND THAT BOOK'S CALLED ""THAT FAITH, THAT LOVE, THAT TRUST."""
4,Great Book,This book can be enjoyed by Christian readers looking for an interesting book without all the drama. Great story with a great lesson! FORGIVENESS!
1,I Hate It,I did not purchase this book for my Fire at all so I'm not sure why its asking me to rate this product unless it was done by mistake by someone(child) that wasn't supposed to be messing around on my Fire to begin with.
4,A Sweet Love Story,"I enjoyed this book. A sweet, modern love story with all the problems of human fraility as well as the hope and dreams we all have at one time or another."
4,okay,"I have severe nose bleeds at times that I have had for 50 years. These help by inserting and pinching the nose, cutting the time it normally takes to stop the bleeding. The only complaint is the thickness of the treated pads, almost too thin for me."
4,Good to keep on hand,"My elderly Father gets nose bleeds often and has to be taken to the ER from his nursing home only to have them plug his nose with something that resemble this product.. Hopefully this product will help him in the future, we haven't tried it yet. Will provide up date in the future."
5,Nasal Stop Bleed,"Half the price than in stores... when one can find them in the drugstore!product works on minor nosebleedGreat to have in car, bathroom, in office..just in caserapid delivery"
4,Works as advertised,"There's nothing magical about this product, although it definitely works. I've suffered nosebleeds for years and have always had to keep a tissue handy in case. I've also tried using a nose insert that you just plug in your nose but that looks ridiculous and is not practical to have in your pocket.What's nice about this is that it's flat, so you can keep it in your pocket, and it does an excellent job absorbing the blood. I actually got a nosebleed in the middle of a tennis match and using this product enabled me to finish the match.The only bad thing I would say is that it seems a bit pricey. Great product overall."
3,Can I be Frank-- NO,"Sorry, don't agree with other reviewers. Was disappointed. Sounded pretty ordinary and little of the great big band support normally found with classic crooners like Frank."
1,Not worth the $,This is a 772 word document (2 pages in 13 point font). Very general information with no specific guidelines on legal requirements for documents.
2,Misrepresented,"Product does NOT have shoulder straps as noted in item description. Many people want to carry their small pets close to their upper bodies, not dangling at the end of their hand."
1,Huge disappointment,This item was reviewed along with the bird bath purchased from same vendor. There was really nothing wrong with the stand other than there was no way to attach it to the birdbath it was sold with. I got stuck for the return shipping of the birdbath and the customer service rep was horrible.
5,Highly Recommended!,"How long has it been since you came across a book that you want to read twice? This book, with its eye-catching cover featuring the title as an embossed leather patch on the backside of a pair of blue jeans, is that kind of book. Authors Richard D. Czerniawski and Michael W. Maloney created this organized guide for marketing professionals and wrote it in a way that lets every reader learn. You are always told what you are about to learn, you're tested on that knowledge and then you are given real-life examples that reinforce the lesson. The authors debunk ""established"" methods, which they find condescending to marketing professionals. They believe that most marketers are tactically strong, but need to learn more about the strategic requirements of creating brand loyalty. We at getAbstract strongly recommend this book to senior managers, marketers, academics and - if you want to be savvy, too - consumers."
5,Blind Evil,"This is an absolute must for anyone who has ever had a narcissitic partner. I have suffered from the trauma of such a relationship, and reading this and having my therapist borrow it and coach me through PTSD, depression and panic attacks, I have managed to heal. Vaknin lives the malignancy. Unfortunately, the malignancy grows and almost kills the partner, like it almost did me.If you have been in a relationship with one of these afflicted people, get this book and get help immediately."
5,Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited,This book saved my sanity. Narcissistic abuse leaves it's victims doubting reality. The Narcissist constructs a dark and frightening world. He imprisons his family and his cult members in this dungeon. Why would someone lie so much? Why does he insist on engaging in such self destructive and often violent behavior? What could he possibly gain from this? Is this unique? Are there others who have experienced such slander? Why do people worship this awful person? Will it ever change?I found all the answers in this book. I found the courage to get out.
1,Fraudulent and Hypocritical,"A diagnosed psychopath and self-professed narcissist himself, the author has flooded the internet with so many articles and posts designed to enchant the seeker of information into believing he is an expert. See for yourself... [search ipsychopath on youtube and many other references] He has no accredited professional training, thus I felt his assertions based on science to be skating the line of fraudulent. I wanted so badly to find relevant information on this disorder and to believe in this book but how can one believe in the author when he has so many admitted personality issues himself? I cannot recommend this book- in fact-I recommend that you do not read it."
3,Malignant Narcissistic Disorder,"Very verbose and not exactly written for the layman to understand. More information than you could possibly take in or begin to fully comprehend. Interesting material, but a hard read and a long read. Could take a very long time to complete it, and then you would still need to read it two more times to really get it. Also, very expensive!"
2,A clinical book,"This book reads like a college text book and I think that it would be perfect for that use; it is full of relevant information and is presented in a very clinical way. The book reviews say that this is the Bible of narcissism, I would disagree. It is difficult to read if you take it out of a scholastic and collegiate context. I would not recommended this book to a friend unless they wanted a book for school; I'm sure it is full of information but it bored me to tears."
5,Make this your first stop!,"If you are looking for a one-stop shop on narcissism then this is it! Knowledge is power- and Sam Vaknin's detailed and informative book gives you the inside scoop on what makes a narcissist tick and how to handle one. I highly recommend this book to anyone involved with a narcissist to help them turn the situation in their favour. It worked for me, and saved me a fortune in expensive therapy sessions which may not have helped me identify my situation and deal with it properly anyway. Please take the first step in breaking the narcissist's abusive hold on you and buy this book."
3,"I haven't read the book, but watched his youtube videos","I haven't read this book, but I have watched his youtube videos. I am a little concerned whether he is a reputable source of information. His youtube videos kind of come of as random rants wrapped in this false-detached logic.And I don't know if him being self-declared narcissist means he is more a source on this subject matter, or that his personal condition taints his message and it becomes flawed when delivering it to others.I recommend reading Trapped in the Mirror, Children of the Self Absorbed, and Will I ever be good enough before reading this one. They are 60% cheaper. I also recommend the Self Esteem workbook for children of NPD as well.Like all literary works, they represent one point of view. When referencing books to help with a real life problem and in this case a personality disorder, it's more advantageous to reference multiple sources."
1,Truly one of the worst books I have ever read,"This is one the most self-indulgent, poorly written novels I have ever read. It is all ""I, I, I,"" with the clunkiest of plots. When the author cannot reach resolution re her relationship with her husband, she has him killed off in another country! Virtually NOTHING about Senegal, which is what I bought it for."
2,"Mediocre plot, shallow characters","The book is relatively well-written. However, the plot is shallow and none of the characters are well-developed. The dialogs aren't believable. The relvelations in the book are blase. It's a quick, light read, but not particularly interesting."
2,"Not happy with my purchase, not because of the product, it's the seller.","The item arrived promptly. However, it's the wrong model. It doesn't fit to my attachment. When I emailed the seller about this problem, I never got any reply back from them. I am very disappointed with their customer service. JB."
1,Disappointing!!,"We purchased this item 2 weeks ago at a local store. It has been a very disappointing toy. The Mermaid's arms keep falling off, the hinged part of the toy have trouble staying together, and the mermaid has a hard time keeping her fins on. Very poor quality."
4,BEGINNER PLANTED TANK HOBBYIST,"I had set up a planted tank and was using a carbon additive one every 3-4 days. The plants did ok, but not much growth. Once I set this thing up my tank turned completely green!! I MEAN THE WATER AS WELL haha. so I wound up purchasing a UV sterilizer to even things out a bit. Now that I have a balance I have 20 tetras schooling around a jungle in my 46 gallon bow front tank! True carbon source makes a huge difference! Just add sugar (your own) along with the packets they include and some water and you are set! very simple and cheap compared to a full on CO2 system. ONLY thing I don't really like is the rather big plate you have to suction cup inside your tank.. one of my shrimp got stuck in it and died! :(ENJOY!"
3,"You're paying for the canister and the diffuser, the packets are useless","After reading some reviews on DIY CO2 diffusers for my planted aquarium, I decided to pay for this unit because it was relatively cheap on sale, and I would have rather had a finished looking unit than a soda bottle rig.After trying to use the included packets to no avail, I read some Q&A; online and found that a majority of the Hagen packets included with the unit are expired. I had no bubbles for the first 24 hours, so I checked the packet and bingo - over 9 months expired.DIY recipe is easy - sugar, yeast, baking soda, and warm water! The packets included are useless, and you supply your own sugar and water if you buy this anyways.If you buy this unit it will be for a nice, finished canister (albeit small compared to a DIY 2 liter soda jug), and a ready to go diffuser/tubing unit. I'm glad I got it on sale, and it does what it's supposed to do with my own CO2 recipe."
4,Works and is entertaining,"I love this bubble counter. I will warn you that when you first set it up you'll get mad cause there will be no bubble at first. Try to level the bubble counter as much as possible. My plants are still alive and that's all I wanted! But my kids and I like to watch the bubble so it's entertaining also. After you set up the fermenting canister you need to leave it alone for a few days to a week possibly to see the bubbles start, but they will start. Also when it's time to but a replacement fermenting mix look up online how to make your own because it's a lot cheaper."
2,for the money there are better products,so the diffuser ladder was alot bigger than i though it would be ( its for tanks UP TO 20 gallons). the included yeast packets were old and dead. this is the first hagen product that i have not loved.
4,A piece of the puzzle,"I'm not an expert in planted aquariums but am slowly learning. The device is pretty sturdy, but I found the yeast mixture they provide doesn't produce much in the way of CO2 and seems to fizzle out quickly. The bubble counter it comes with on the other hand is great! Much better than using an airstone! I ended up using a homemade yeast recipe I found online in a 2L soda bottle in conduction with the bubble counter. Also Amazon had a MUCH better price on this than my local pet store, its pays to check prices on the mobile app when you out shopping!"
4,Very nice!,Outdoor persons will really llike this vudui! Beautiful presentation. Tells the story of the Monarch in detail. Color is wonderful.
3,"what science there is, is GOOD","this documentary is very informative, even giving me answers that i have personally been looking for awhile now(mostly the attempts to MRI the actual process). I loved the science that WAS IN IT.To get around the problem of the religious agenda watch up to the 50 minute mark that is where the science stops and the cdesign proponentsists show their true form"
1,Metamorphosis: The Beauty and Design of Butterflies (DVD),Just another intelligent design propaganda video cloaked to appear as science. It is a shame these people go to so much effort to produce something that only preaches to the choir.
4,Great Movie -but,"This is a fantastic movie, the information is astounding. The only problem is that I honestly fell asleep watching it. I'm not saying it's boring, it's not I'm just telling the truth.Everything was interesting. I've probably watched it a minimum of ten times because I love the informaiton. Watching the information in the cocoon change over a short period of time with scan images was incredible. It's beautiful how the catipillar becomes a butterfly in such an amazing way. clearly not by slight, unguided, accidental changes. Just incredible.I fully recommend this movie. It really is one of my favorites."
5,Fantastic Video,"The video was mind-boggling! What a wonderful way to show God's masterful design in nature! It demonstrates the beauty and intricate, detailed design of butterflies. It will increase one's faith for sure."
5,fascinating,"I had never appreciated how amazing these creatures are, and how many mysteries remain about their incredibly complex developmental process and behaviors."
3,products works,I wasn't sure how to remove the empty spool & then replase it but I did read just how to do it. Instructions are easy to follow. This is a great weed eater & easy to use. Perfect for a woman who needs a easy to use weed eater that is not heavy.
5,Great inspiration to journal,"I turn to this book time and again for inspiration for my own watercolor journal and sketches when I'm in a journaling slump. This book is loaded with the sketches and illustrations of Erin O'Toole's own journals, and her great advice to start and continue with your own journal. The book is nicely divided into sections for sketching flowers, wildlife, neighborhoods, animals and people. She also gives advice on labeling your sketches and being creative with your writing style. All in all, this is a great book to have on hand."
5,Journals done in Watercolors,I saw this book in a watercolors sketchbook class I took and liked it so well I wanted it in my collection. It has great ideas for journaling and has gotten me on the road to creating my own artists journal. Has great advise. This book came quickly and in excellent condition. This is a must have if you are into sketchbook journaling.
1,This Book Sucks!,I still can't beleive that some people gave this book anything that resembles a good rating. What is wrong with you people? This book was so boring that I threw it away after the first three days of buying it. I dont recomend it.
5,"A must for interpersonal relations, conflict resolution.","I also picked up this book after skimming several Aikido technique manuals. What a pleasant surprise to find out that this book ultimately has little to do with physical techniques. I've used Dobson's ""Conflict Options"" several times since my first read. With all sincerity these really work. His explanation of conflict options, with the addition of ""AIKI"" as a ""technique"" to address an attack, have actually enhanced my interpersonal relationships, i.e. work and most importantly, at home. This book has more to do with psychology, geometry, and education than with what you may think about martial arts. Yet the conflict options can also be used in a physical setting as well. Find this book somewhere, it's a keeper!"
3,an interesting approach to conflict management,"Dobson presents an interesting approach to conflict resolution. He uses a set of geometric figures as a metaphor for the different ways we could react to conflict in our daily lives. On the surface, the pictures are pretty silly, and the sample dialogues seem rather contrived. But underneath, the ideas are sound. Anyone with knowledge of Aikido and/or Zen principles will recognize the core concepts immediately, although others may have a harder time taking him seriously. Don't buy this book if you are looking for a set of quick tricks that will enable you to bend others to your will. To apply Dobson's strategies successfully, you might have to change your way of thinking about yourself and your relationships."
3,interesting exercise but self-indulgent,Ms. Lively's premise intrigued me but ended up not impressing me. It ended up seeming more a self-indulgent exercise for the author and always validating the choice she actually made. I found the storytelling mild-mannered and stopped before making a definite point. I did like the story of the old woman in the historic house full of books and the woman who discovered what happened to the half-sister she never met.
4,A new genre,"This fine British novelist has created with this book a new genre which combines autobiography with fiction. Lively tells a bit about an event in her own life, then with fictional characters weaves a tale that might have happened had she taken a different route, or accepted an offer, or married someone else. Her stories bring up in the readers' imagination our own ""roads not taken."""
1,Cute but worthless!,"This is such a cute watch, but it DOESN'T WORK. I returned it and requested a replacement, but the new one didn't work either. I see other people said the same thing about children's Activa watches, so beware!"
5,Best Investment Book in Existence,"It's hard to find a good investment book to fill the young mind. I am 19 and I like investing and finance. This is by far the best book I have ever read about investing. It doesnt teach you patterns or little tricks, but simply tells you about Wall Street's best stories, trades, and multiple traders strategies and how they did what they did to become successful. If you like hedge funds this is a must read if you like investing READ THIS. You will not find a better book about Wall Street other than this book. True Story ;)"
3,expected more,"honestly, i expected more from this book. Strongly recommend Jack Schwager's fist book ""Market wizards"". In that book interviewed traders talk more about their trading strategies while in the second book ""new market wizards"" they just talk about their experience which less useful for us as readers."
4,Traders Only,"Schwager has done an excellent job of following his first book Market Wizards.Any trader will find the book interesting, informative and motivating. The author interviews traders with different trading styles, using different methodologies in diffent markets. If you are looking for a book that gives you an inside look about what is truly possible in trading the markets for yourself, this is it.The only thing I would warn people about with this book is that you have to be interested in trading or it won't be for you."
4,"Insightful, easy reading with valuable lessons","A great read for those daring souls considering the life of a trader. The traders interviewed all provide valuable lessons that could have saved me thousands of dollars (or more) if I had only read this book sooner. It also puts things in perspective when you read how much timeand effort these guys put into their work to become the best. Very enlightening, although I found the book to get a bit dry in the middle."
5,Another useful volume in the Wizards series,"Continuing in his series of interviews with yet more top traders, Jack Schwager is providing even more excellent insights. Again I recommend reading this book multiple times, writing your own notes, and formulating a trading plan of your own rather than using the 'cheat's' summary at the end of the book in the 'Closing Bell' chapter."
4,Motivating,"This book is fun to read and motivating. It is just a bunch of interviews with pro traders. Author asks questions and they answer. They provide relivant and motivating information about trading. I liked, I like it alot more than I like writing reviews. But, I figured since i liked it I would put in a good word for it."
4,No secrets,"Jack does a nice job as usual. Have a plan, stick to it, and don't let your emotions control your trading.Everyone loses in the beginning, so you need cash to keep going."
5,CareerDayTrader.com - Brilliant Follow Up to Original Book,"A brilliant follow up to the classic, more traders, more lessons, and more insights."
4,"how i made 2,000,000, , need in cd or audio authourDARVUS...","the only books i am searching for are in audio and cd prefered; autours are lafever ,loeb,nicholas darves all on ivesting in stocks also the new wallstreets wizards would be good all must be in listening format........."
2,This book missed many great traders,Some of the richest and most succesfull traders were not presented in this book. Toby Crabel- for example is not listed here and the guy according to the hedge fund industry is the best money manager around.I read couple of his articles on Ebay and seriously he is gives much more detail than any of the Market Wizards.
2,This was too technical for novices.,"A good attempt, but if you're a novice trying to understand the market this isn't the book to read"
4,fluctuates in accordance with volatility.,"""Adopting a formula that limited both my profits and drawdowns by notching back the number of contracts traded in each market ... the key is that the number of contracts traded fluctuates in accordance with each market's volatility.""Tom BassoHow long is it going to take me to learn this one?"
5,"Good value for ""my"" money","Comparatively speaking this book is not as great as Market Wizards. However they both have the same theme, in my opinion."
3,General insights into successful traders/investors...,"Through a series of interviews, Jack Schwager introduces the readers to traders he deems to be Market Wizards. He talks to people trading in different markets, employing different methodologies, and exhibiting different strengths and weaknesses. In spite of the differences, Schwager identifies some commonalities. Schwager sums up the book by offering his takeaways for being a successful trader. Some of them are quite obvious (e.g. have a passion for trading and examine your reasons for trading, have an edge) while other are more subtle (e.g. match your trading style with your personality, have a method).Having attended a lecture given by him, Schwager will be first to tell you how he had to modify his trading style and methodology to a quantitatively-driven one. Before the change, he felt that he lacked the discipline to exit his positions subjectively."
3,Wearever Nonstick Shallow Baking Pan,"I received this pan as a gift and have only used it once. The brownies baked perfectly - no dry edges, but I do have one complaint. The non-stick surface scratches very easily. Even though I didn't use a sharp knive to cut the brownies, the surface was scratched up pretty bad. I wish they could make the non-stick surface harder without having to pay upwards of $30 for a cookie sheet."
2,Nice to have,"Zen was nice to have. I computer troubles had arose not, may've gotten more use from. But alas, no. Was effective on keeping my schedule, pictures, music; hmm, come to think of it, I miss my Zen."
2,"Rough beginning, great middle, horrid ending","This book suffers a bit from odd terminoligy never explained (still don't know what in heck a ""front junkie"" is). I thought the beginning read rough while I was trying to understand her odd future-tech world that she didn't explain well. But in the middle it went much better and I was thinking it was a great book. Then poof, she obviously had NO idea how to end it, and the last 50-100 pages just plod on horridly like she had no real inspiration or motivation for writing those words other than to get it published and make some money. A book that just drops off from great to bad like that isn't worth reading in my mind."
5,Dystopia at its best (or worst),"The title says it all: the book is about allthe various technologies we humans developand then go on to use for vile purposes; welfare drones serving as human computers, tranquilizing wasps and giant mantises are only a few of the toys employed by Ore's very real and plausible future world. If you're cynical and fed up one societal terror after another, read this book. I wouldn't be surprised if the author gets regular phonecalls asking her if she's starting a cult."
1,Gaia's Toys should be kindling,"This has got to be the absolute WORST book I've ever read in my entire life. I got to page ten and started yawning, and by page 20 I determined that kindling was the best use for this book. It's not worth the 5 bucks to ship it back even."
1,This toy is horrible,Kids can't balance on it to even get started hopping up and down.We have had it for weeks and non of the neighborhood kids can do it.
1,pogo ball,"I have no idea how to blow the ball up, and it comes with no directions or what pump to use. So it's still inflated and hasn't been used."
5,Effectiveness Equal to Prescription Motility Drugs!,"When my digestion slowed way down years ago, and I could only eat a little food before feeling very full, I didn't want to take prescription motility drugs. My search ended when I found Regimint. It worked great! I still use it whenever my digestion acts up. It even indirectly helps with GERD, since it helps the food move through the stomach more easily. A great product that I highly recommend!"
4,Daniela is super cool!!!,"Daniela Romo is a woman whose music is thought to only be ballads ,but she proves everyone wrong,and as such,for this musical deliacacy ,she is teamed with Loris Ceroni(producer of OV7)The best here are as such:""Te quiero mi amor""(full of pop finesse)""Las heridas""(the best ballad here)and three of her greatest hits redone to sound more modern(De mi enamorate,Quiero amanecer con alguien,and,Non miglio voici la luna),if you like dance music then this offering is most definetely you....,"

2,"Good Songs, bad concert","I have been a hudge fan of Renaud since ever. I was one of those teens that only listen to him and nothing else for several years.After a long desert crossing, he finally came back with ""Boucan d'Enfer"" that was an excellent album. The tone was darker than usual, and you could feel a different level of maturity of the artist.This concert though, is bad. Just plain bad. Renaud really shows us how bad these last years have been for him. The singing is laborious, and often out of tune. He knows the lyrics, but they sound like the slur of an unmotivated 10 years old reciting boring poetry.No interaction with the public with his usual and very personal tone. He was really out of it at that concert. I suspect he was drunk. It reminded me of some of the late concerts of Gainsbourg when he was showing up on stage completly wasted.I recommend the album strongly, but you can pass on this concert unless you are a die hard fan that need to have it."
4,since nobody else reviewed this one....,Someone should get the word out- she's good. I have this one and her debut from the 60's and all her songs are well done. She does a bluesy type of jazz and she's been doing it for some time now without ever becoming a big star. Aiming at Nothing is the major cut here. Try this or one of herr other cd's and you'll discover a real talent.
4,TARGET buyers beware!!,"I purchased this item @ Target on impulse which cost me $65.00 more than on the internet @ that time. Target would not attempt to match or give a store credit for $ 65.00 or any amount for that matter. Be very careful when buying/ anything at Target!As far as the product is concerned, it is not as good as the other Sony 5 disc DVD player I own/use. The sound (speech)could be better quality and the loading of DVD's is combersome in comparison to my other Sony model. No on screen display when changing DVD's and a disc location light has stopped operating.Music sounds terrific."
1,"It ""eats"" discs and Sony doesn't have a clue","I'd owned my machine 14 months when it froze a DVD and refused to eject it. Sony's manual and on-line site gave no good correction so I called Sony's ""help"" line and was told to do the same thing the manual said, which I had already done to no avail. Then I was told to send it to a Service Center and for $134 they would tell me how much the fix was. Went to some consumer websites and discovered I wasn't the only one with problems with a Sony 5 cartridge disc machine. And all had the same problem- disc capture and non-eject. Please save yourself some headaches and don't get this type of player. Oh, and the volume for TV is really low, no way to enhance it; no HDMI, either."
3,Average system,"Dear Buyers, you get what you pay for. It's a decent entry level home theatre. If you have an HDTV then please invest in nice DVD player. This will not suffice! Avg. picture quality but sound is acceptable with hi fidelity and good surround. 4 or 5 stars is very generous and not deserving for this item!"
1,subpar,Have to crank it to max to get the surround sound effect. My 56 inch samsung dlp 780p has a stronger sound in the tv mode. This may be a decent starter system but I wish i'd bought a less expensive one as my first surriund system cause I'm definately disappointed. Don't buy this!!!!
5,VERY PLEASED!,"The shirt arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I gave it as a Christmas gift and the giftee was very pleased, as was I!"
2,Disappointed,"It would have been perfect if I were able to use it. The top only fits into two of the slots - not all four. It is also quite wobbly so I purchased some locking nuts to help keep it stable. Of course, the top is on a slant until I can get someone to bend the legs so that they might fit. I would have returned the item if the box in which it was shipped did not have to be cut apart in order to open it and retrieve the item. Actually, this was not worth it at any price. I wasted my money and thought seriously of contacting my credit card company to withhold payment."
3,Black marks all over you doorways,"Fun product, but when the fun is done there is black everywhere. The rubber stoppers make a mess on woodwork after the puppet theater is removed."
2,Looks nice but the rod doesn't work. At all.,"The fabric is nice, my kids love it, but it is a major pain to get the curtain rod in place. You have to hold up a rather heavy piece of fabic over your head for 5-8 minutes while you try, over and over, to get the rod to lock into place. And then after 5 minutes of gentle play, the damn thing falls down again."
5,The Hit of the Party!,"LOVE this Reeve and Jones Doorway Puppet Theater! It's well designed, easy to set up, lots of style and fun! We bought it for our daughter's 4th birthday party along with some Melissa and Doug Puppets and did a ""home spun"" puppet show for the party. The kids rushed the stage afterwards to play. It's all in the details: adjustable rod fits most doorways, black sheer blackdrop, drop down stage, pockets for puppets on the back, regal purple color, velvet curtain with velcro tiebacks, bag for storage! No problem at all with working the rod, but it does leave marks on the wall. I think we are going to permenantly hang it from the ceiling in a corner of my daughter's room anyhow. Enjoy! Really great quality, worth every cent!"
5,Waves of Dreams,"This book is an excellent fantasy art book. The paintings are very well laid out and clean. The mermaids are as beautiful as Royo's works, but they stand on their own. The details in the paintings are very subtle. The pictures have a very dream-like quality to them like fog and mist. The far off places travelled to and the characters encountered will expand the reader's imagination and make the reader want to know more. You should not pass this book by. It is worth adding to your fantasy art collection."
5,Astounded!,"I was astounded to read any view that rated this book less than 5 out of 5. Not knowing this famous artist's work is no excuse for being disappointed when ordering the book sight unseen. All one needs to do is google his name and you will see oodles of googles and they are all exquisite. The book (as the title indicates) is not all mermaids - hence the word AND in the title. I can only tell you that I found this book to be absolutely gorgeous, and anyone picking it up on my coffee table to browse through it instantly wants one. The parts of the mermaids are incredible - faces and all other parts. I love the humanity he imparts to fantasy creatures, the mystical settings, the quality of the book, not to mention the sheer genius of the artist's talent. For these reasons and more I highly recommend this book. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could."
4,A good deal on a hard-to-find part,Pros: Seems to be the right part for the Dana 30 front axle in a 1998 Jeep Wrangler.Cons: I had to use a bit more than the recommended torque on the pinion nut to compress it enough to take the free play out of the pinion.
3,"Please, more Choir, less Instruments!","I agree with the first reviewer. At age 56, I heard these guys live, and the arrangements were sublime. The vocals were amazing. Here, the instruments almost drown out the choir! Perhaps the pianist and bass player were relatives of the producer?? I would recommend almost any other Luboff CD over this one, even the ones reproduced with pops and hisses from the LP.""Colorado Trail"" is OK. ""Shenandoah"", one of the Choir's signature songs, is totally messed up.Very disappointing, I'm sorry."
3,"""A"" FOR EFFORT","As a Norman Luboff Choir fan, I was extremely pleased to hear that a modern high fidelity remake was available of some of Mr. Luboff's works. Thank you to Mr. Berkey for resurrecting Mr. Luboff. I hope more discs are in the works or planned without the following shortcoming.Unfortunately, the disc was disappointing because of what may appear to some to be a silly reason but not to me. The recording engineer probably did everything right except establish the presence of the choir relative to the instruments. Listen to a Norman Luboff Choir vinyl album or re-release on CD to hear what I mean.In the original records, the choir is acoustically featured while in this CD, it's just another choir with equal emphasis placed on the orchestra. I hope that in future releases if any, the producer demands the same emphasis be placed on the choir voices as was originally applied in the recordings. After all, it is the Norman Luboff Choir voices I want to hear."
3,I'm a mom of 6,"I tried this gripe water before and worked great then, but not this time (it may have not been a fresh batch or something). Luckily, I bought another brand at the same time to compare to this one and it worked great! Try that one. It is Mommy's Bliss. Good luck with the sad baby with the colic!"
5,Works like a charm!,"Our son has acid reflux and is on Zantac to help with the spitting up. However, at night, he still has all kinds of gas that wakes him up every 1-2 hours. We decided to try gripe water as the Mylicon drops did nothing to help him. We only give it to him at night because that is the only time he has this issue and since starting it, he sleeps 8-11 hours every night without waking up once AND wakes up in the morning HAPPY! This morning he cooed to himself for over 30 minutes before realizing he was hungry. I'd recommend this to anyone with a colicky baby."
2,"no harm, but did not work","I wish I could say this worked wonders for my little guy, but it did not. I don't think it hurt, but it did not help either. He is still struggling with the gas (started at 3 weeks, now he's 13 weeks) and I am still searching for a solution. Tried Mylicon, this gripe water, infant massage, chamomile tea, quitting dairy, using probiotics (for myself, to pass through breast milk) as recommended by the pediatrician, and now onto Colic Calm. The pacifier helps him get through the worst of the gas. Hopefully something else will work, or he will just ""grow out of it"" once his GI system matures a bit more, as it is said will happen. So frustrating to not really be able to help him yet. One good thing is Whole Foods refunded my money for it."
1,Deceptive labeling,"I previously bought Baby's Bliss gripe water (on amazon), and was very disappointed when I got it and discovered that it contains sugar -- fructose is one of the ingredients. Why would I want to give my newborn sugar water?In theory I could make my own, but my time has some value, so I've been searching for an alternative, that just has the active ingredients, without sugar.I was happy to discover this brand, that claims clearly on the front, ""NO ... SUCROSE""Don't be fooled. The NUMBER ONE INGREDIENT in this is fructose. So yes, technically, it does not have sucrose. But the implication that it has no added sugar is a lie. It's mostly sugar water.Doesn't anybody just sell a plain extract of ginger, fennel, and possibly chamomile ? At this point I may just make my own."
2,Read the bottle first!,I love the fact that it's organic but be careful because this needs to be refrigerated and I only realized that later. I have already openend it a couple of days prior so I had to throw it out because it was out without refrigeration. Plus it's a bit inconvenient since I need to use it on the spot and it's going to be too cold for a baby( unless you want to give your baby out of the refrigerator ). Personally I don't have time to take out a bit so I can use it later. I need to be able to use it right out of the bottle in which case this doesn't work since it's too cold.
3,Not sure how effective it is,I used this a few times but I haven't seen a difference. Maybe if I used it daily I would see improvement. Not sure on this one. Gas drops seem to work better with my baby.
1,Nope- did not work!,Tried this a few times with my daughter and it didn't work... Also inconvenient to have to keep it in the fridge so it's freezing when You try to use it.
2,Didn't live up to the hype,Gripe water did nothing for my son. Just another one of those things people raved about that did nothing for my son.
3,Likely a placebo effect only,"There maybe some benefit, but overall I feel that it stimulates the bowels more and sometimes seem to worsen the gas issues. I think that there is likely a placebo effect. So overall, I do not think that I will use this item again."
3,"Works, but...","Ive only used this a couple times now, and not when my baby is in his extremely fussy moods so I dont know how well it works for that. But it got rid of his hiccups within a couple of minutes. Previously I was using Baby's Bliss gripe water which worked great, but that bottle kept leaking and it didnt come with a dropper. This says dispenser included - which is just that, a plastic syringe which says not for oral use. Are you serious? How hard could it be for companies to have a dropper like they do for vitamin drops and infant tylenol? I really was hoping it came with a dropper attached bc I dont want the hassle of cleaning a dropper each time I use it which is a couple times during the day. I nurse my baby so putting it in a bottle is not an option. That was disappointing. As well as the fact that my baby hates the taste of this! He loved the taste of Baby's Bliss gripe water."
3,Iffy results,"My daughter has suffered from severe boughts of colic. A friend suggested we use this product as it seemed to help their son, so my husband and I went out and got this immediately. We noticed that, while it did help somewhat,she still had horrible boughts of pain and crying even when we had given her the medicine. Plus, it was hard to get her to take it since it has to be refridgerated. So we were trying to get her to take what seemed like a whole lot of liquid (4 ml or something like that)that was very cold...she wouldn't take the bottles with the medicine in it. It did help her sleep better...but in the thick of her colicky throes--it fell flat."
1,Didn't work for us either,My baby is acid reflux as well and this product did not help her. I'm not sure if it made it worse but she is certainly not better.
5,Love this stuff,Must have for a parent of an infant. Helps with tummy aches. Not a miracle by any means but it helps. We ended up taking our baby to the chiropractor (sounds nuts but google it) and THAT has been the miracle for us. Baby actually sleeping now. Whew!
1,Terrible quality,"The Rosetta Stone software could be an effective tool if the quality of the CDs was any good. Instead, on several computers - running both Windows XP and Mac OSX operating systems - I experienced the CDs as buggy, noisy, making the program so prone to crashing as to render it completely useless. Do not buy."
3,not for improving your English,"If you are looking to improve your English, don't try it, this just some of the basics for the beginners"
5,"Women have come a long way, baby!","This book is a real breakthrough for women of all ages who desire to fully embrace their sexuality and break free of outmoded codes of sexual behavior. This is not a technique or clinical advice book, but rather a real live connection to women's true fantasies and turn-ons,vividly brought to life by honest sexually-driven women - a shattering of obsolete stereotypes! A statement in the chapter ""Express yourself"" especially hit home with me: ""At the end of the day, you are defined by how you feel, not by what someone else thinks of you"". So true. For any person, man or woman, who feels passionately about women finally coming into their own as whole human beings, this book is the real deal."
1,Latin Grammy CD a Disappointment,"Latin music usually refers to salsa, merengue, ballads, norteña, etc. This cd had way too much Reggaeton - a new genre of rap/reggae which appeals to the youth. Some of it is a bit on the vulgar side. I feel as if I wasted my money. Talking out a song is not singing - and this Reggaeton should be in a category of its own."
5,A Holistic Approach,"A recent magazine article about Nelson's success sparked my interest in his methods. I acquired the The Incredible Payback to learn more of Nelson's purchasing and supplier development experiences and ideas. In this book, he details how these functions can improve the financial health of a business. His presentation is clear and comprehensive, covering many practices that have led both him and others to success. He shares cost reductions resulting from the implementation of these practices. He explains the critical role of software relative to his purchasing and supply chain management vision. I'm eager to apply the ideas that Nelson has presented."
1,THIS VIEWER SHOW NO VIEWS,"THIS ITEM CAME WITH NO INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS. MY CARPENTER INSTALLED IT THE BEST HE COULD AS THERE WAS A HUGE HOLE IN MY DOOR. THE IMAGE WAS CLOUDY, AND REVERSED (RIGHT TO LEFT). THE CARPENTER CHANGED THE LENS AND INSERTS, AND NOTHING CHANGED. THIS IS THE FIRST ITEM I ORDERED FROM AMAZON THAT HAD NO INSTRUCTIONS."
4,Innovative!,"You dont have to put your eye up to this to see outside. You can view it as far as 6 feet away. The only issue I had with it was that you cant see anything when its dark outside. It only works when you have sufficient and I mean really bright lighting near this peephole when its dark out. During the daytime its great. The optics isnt crystal clear, image is bit blurry but you can see out well enough through its wide angle lens."
4,Nice view but make sure you have the right tools.,"I used to have one of these at my old house and some other friends had bought some. I think they used to be hard to find and were one of those things sold by door to door type sales people. I like this one and the quality seems to be pretty good. Only one problem is that it took me a while to install because apparently a 2-3/8 inch hole saw is not that easy to find unless you buy a separate arbor and hole saw which is a little pricey (I ended up paying $30 for a rigid arbor and hole saw from home depot - which happens to be more than the viewer) -- most hole saw kits seem to jump from 2"" to 2-1/2"" or 2-1/8"" to 2-1/2"". Probably would have liked it better if they used a more readily available hole size, but overall still pretty good."
3,Wide angle door viewer,Should be used only for an outside facing door (rather than an interior door) otherwise there is not enough light for good resolution.
5,Great Safety,This is really great. You can see the whole front yard not just one part of a persons face. You know how many are there and you can see from their head to their toes. You don't have to stick your face up to the door you can just stand back and see everything you need to see even at night with the porch light on I can see everything and feel safe about opening the door. Great for all I got one for each of my kids and my Mom.
4,slight blur (by design),"I have four of these in all colors, also in both metal and ABS plastic. All of them have a slight blur. Your typical small door viewer has better lens quality. The larger size lens helps compensate a bit for the lower quality blurriness. Lower light conditions affect the visibility even more. I will pay more for better lenses.I use these for my smaller kids, so I need to install them a bit lower,,,ideally to be slightly above the kid's eye level while high enough to see the face of the person outside the door. Due to natural optics characteristics, smaller kids will not be able to use the viewer if installed at adult heights.Overall,,, nice product with acceptable quality,,,, but could be improved."
1,too much to pay for plastic,"Beware this item is 100% plastic. The one I bought was warped. The ""machining"" was poor quality with every hole in the plate having a corresponding warp in the plate itself. I immediately returned it."
2,no slide,the router and circular saw slide are hard to attach to the saw in particular. both do not slide on the rail with out forcing them which results in a bad cut or rout job. would not buy these again or recommend them to anyone.
2,better read it before buying,"I am afraid I have to agree with most of the reviewers, mostly Straitjacket and Elizabeth Lockett.This manga has fairly beautiful art and titillating ideas but for the rest it falls short, shorter than it is usual even for the worst examples among this genre.The plot is desperately thin and contrived, characterization stereotyped and highly inconsistent with the prehistorical setting chosen. There is not a single move of the characters which is not predictable and trite, plus the usual skinny effemminate boy versus the manly dominant figure.A booklet to borrow before buying: the art may be interesting (sex scenes are dull, though, as it is often the case) and the sequence of the drawings confused."
4,"well, at least the art was good.","All I can say is that it is a good thing that my main interest in manga is the art. The art in this book is beautiful. The people and backgrounds are beautifully done, the frames flow well from one motion to the next. On the other hand the stories left me wanting. Maybe it's because this is a one shot deal, instead of a series, but there was not alot of character development. The stories were brief and didn't really hold my interest. So if your looking for beautiful art I recomend this book, but if your looking for an interesting story with deep characters go elsewhere. Wild Rock is worth buying, just not for its plot."
3,hmm,"this is from the same author who did Man's Best Friend. I didn't care for Man's Best Friend but I liked this one better. The story is cute, but if you want to see a lot of sex you'll luck out, theres only two sex scenes in it. But I still enjoyed it, like I said the story was cute. if you do get it dont get confused when you get to the second story. the first and last story is about the guy on the cover and another guy, then the second story is about their fathers. I was confused for a bit untill I realized it.lol"
4,wild Rock,I hope they make a second book with these same charters. as this book is fun and action pack. has a great story line and tells what is realy going on. A must read book and Buy
5,About humility and God's love for the mentally handicapped,"There are stories from this small book I was privileged to read once that still challenge and draw me in... Corrie writes about her work teaching a Bible class to mentally-handicapped children in Holland. She tells wonderful stories about how God revealed Himself very personally and simply to the children, how they understood and responded to His love, and how valuable they are to Him personally. She contrasts that with the Nazis' opinion of the mentally handicapped. There are children in that small book that I myself long to be more like, in the simplicity of their devotion and love for Jesus."
1,A Distortion of Wyeth,"Watson is indeed a fine prose writer, but if you are thinking of reading this book to get some insight into Andrew Wyeth and his magnificent work you would be better off sticking with the great Meryman biography. It seems that Watson has taken events in Wyeth's life and thrown them into a distortion machine with results that are at times laughable. If this was meant to be a novel about Wyeth's life,which I was led to believe by a newspaper article, it has failed, for it is, sadly, a crude, mixed-up caracature which does no honor to this great artist. However, if it is just a story about an artist and his models you are looking for, you might find Chevalier's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" to your taste. Sorry, Mr. Watson, you write extremely well, but as a fan of Andrew Wyeth who has read every book in existence on his life, I wish I had skipped this one."
4,beautiful writing,"Sonja, a Norwegian immigrant married to apple grower Henry House is trying to get over the grief of losing her young son--and trying to hold her marriage together. After her husband is hurt, she begins to model for a famous (as well eccentric and self-absorbed) painter. She becomes more than just another model to him and inspires his greatest work. When her husband finds out she's posing nude, sparks begin to fly.Things I liked about this book:- the writing is beautiful- Sonja never lets either or husband or the painter own her--she remains her own person- the descriptions of the paintings--very interesting tidbits about art and techniqueWhat I didn't like so much:- The random order of things: I was often confused about when something was happening, if we were in the past or the present- hard to really feel anything for the charactersAll in all though, a beautiful book worth reading."
2,Didn't like it...,"I'm really surprised that I managed to get through this book. I wanted to close it so many times. I didn't care for the characters at all. I felt that they had no emotions. I didn't understand how any of them could do the things they do. There was so much cheating going on from so many people in this book & although the spouses may have not liked it they all basically knew about it & allowed it to continue. Made no sense to me.I felt that this book was pointless & the way it was organized may confuse you quite a bit. It's so out of order it's like you took the chapters out of the book & shuffled them like a deck of cards. I don't think it was really necessary. I didn't laugh, smile or grip the edge of my seat at any time. There was nothing exciting.I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this book."
2,Couldn't wait to put it down,A really sad novel if you're into that kind of thing. Henry and Sonia lost their son in an accident and although Sonia is grieving the loss of her son she decided to pose nude for Ned an artist. Just seemed like a neverending book of sorrow. This isn't something that I would want to read again. Was surprised I even finised it.
4,A Classic in its Field,"Author Bruno Heim has left us with the definitive work on Catholic ecclesial heraldry. It's doubtful that a work like this will again be written. Heim's designs dominated this area for generations. His written explanations are most valuable for anyone working in heraldry today. This book is expensive, but I don't know anyplace else that you will get this depth of information on the subject."
3,Tells Only Half of the Story,"The forced expulsion of the Germans is only half of what took place. Millions of Poles were also forcibly relocated at the end of the war and deprived of their centuries-old domiciles without due process of law. The eastern half of Poland had been annexed in 1939 by the Soviet Union as part of the German-Soviet conquest of Poland. This thievery was re-affirmed in 1944, this time with the Allies. Millions of Poles were henceforth expelled from eastern Poland and resettled into those territories from which the Germans were simultaneously being expelled. And Poland was supposed to be on the winning side of the war. On that basis, the reader should conclude that the expulsion of Germans had less to do with revenge and more to do with big-power politics."
1,Tries to Convert Germans From Agressors to Victims,"DeZayas masterfully avoids major facts, and invents others. He repeats the baseless canard about 2 million Germans killed during the expulsions (a product of of statistical legerdemain). He fails to inform the reader that almost ALL Germans (not just card-carrying Nazis) supported German imperialistic claims, and that the territories which they were being expelled from had been taken by Germans from their Slavic neighbors over a thousand years of wars of aggression (including the times of the Teutonic Knights, Partitions of Poland, Bismark's Kulturkampf, etc.). Thus DeZayas makes an unconvincing case for his tacit premise that Germans should be free to inflict suffering on others without experiencing any of it in return. For the Germans to experience REAL revenge, they would have had to have suffered in much greater numbers, and over a long period of time."
5,An Eye-Opener,"An excellent book about a tragedy that is still too often unknown in English-speaking countries. Besides making sure the victims are not forgotten, Zayas's book is also important for Americans who want to understand, beyond the anti-German squibblings of some East Coast media, the complicated relationship of the expellor-states, the Czech Republic, Poland and Russia, and today's Germany. My only criticism would be that the pictures and witness accounts of awful, sadistic mass-murder of German civilians in the streets of Bohemia that were cited in Nemesis at Potsdam have been omitted from this--admitedly smaller--book. They were a powerful reminder to Americans, so prone to see history in John Wayne fashion, that evil is not bound to any ethnic group."
5,the other Holocaust,"Yes, these are the horrorific facts which you will not find in any historical books. Has anyone ever wondered when reading about the Holocaust, where did all German minorities, which lived in eastern europe for centuries disappear? The Russians have avenged themselves and had completely erased German ethnies in Eastern Europe during ww2, not just those who collaborated with Hitler, but anyone who was German! Unfortunately these people will never pay for their crimes, because without their help it wouldnt have been possible to defeat Nazi Germany. But what is imperative today, is that people get to learn about this, acknowledge it as a crime against humanity, and understand that ultimately it was the German ethnies all throughout Europe, that had suffered the Nazi tyranny the most."
5,Payback,"This book is payback for the short shrift given by the media to the plight of the Germans in 1945. Mandatory reading for anyone concerned with ethnic cleansing and the media silence that often surrounds such events. De Zayas is a hero for telling this story. The author is clearly anti-Hitler, but after reading about the atrocities committed by Russians I found myself wishing the Soviets had bitten the dust in 1941. Absolutely horrrifying stories and an outstanding book on a piece of (almost) forgotten history."
4,boxer glove,the glove is pretty well made except after a week of using it in the warehouse the no slip tabs on the fingers that you grip boxes and etc with began falling off.I think they were not properly glued. I never had a problem with the old style of boxer glove from this co means i will go thru them a lot faster as the no slip grip tabs are important to my job performance
2,non-oily?,"This scrub is extremely rich. The first time I used it, it made me break out in places I'd never had a problem with before. I ended up using it on my legs and it left them soft and creamy-feeling. Great for legs if you've got money to burn!"
4,Fascinating read,"Eubank's autobiography is fascinating. The segues between his childhood, his investigation into the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, his trip back to Mount Olive and the historical pieces about the Civil Rights movement in Mississippi are sometimes missing or confusing. I also caught a couple editorial mistakes (duplicate words or funny gramatical stuff) that should have been caught by the editor.Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading the book and feel I am coming away from it having learned a great deal about a time and place in history I am personally quite removed from. I read it just after having heard the NPR All Things Considered 5 part piece on the Brown vs. Board of Education decission so Eubank's memoir provided an interesting counterpoint."
4,Civil Rights History,This is an excellent book! The author did an excellent job combining his family experiences with what was happening at the time. I highly recommend this book.
3,Nothing new.,"You've obviously heard the title track ""Chelsea"" if you're checking this CD out, and if you're an actual STEFY fan, then you've already heard the ""exclusive"" track ""Cover Up"" on The Orange Album. Nothing too special here, definitely for the bigger STEFY fans."
3,"Looks nice, quality is questionable","Based on reviews I read, I expected some difficulty in putting the item together, and it was difficult! It looks nice, but I am nervous of its stability. It is wobbly despite adjusting the leg supports to ensure it was even on the floor. When we filled it up with wine, it did not seem as wobbly, but I am nervous with having dogs and walking traffic that it may not be as quality of a rack as I need. It does not seem tall enough to need to attach it to the wall; however, that would be a great way to ease my anxiety of a total disaster. Time will tell."
2,Just OK,"Was looking for a cheap wine rack to put some overflow inventory on and well, I guess you get what you pay for. It has an incredible lean to it when loaded up but it doesn't appear that it will tip without some assistance (holding my breath). Next time, I am going to spend a bit more and get something a bit smaller and more sturdy. It looks good though an was fairly easy to assemble. It is a great conversation starter as well. Guests ask if the wine rack is going to fall over all the time so it really breaks the ice in starting chats."
1,10 Simple Secrets of the World's Greatest Business Communicators,"The author had ""passion"" for and made an effort in the ""preparation"" of this book. Although, this book has some ""good stuff if you can stick to it and find it,"" as commented earlier by a reviewer. Even though ""brevity"" and ""clarity "" are two of the 10 secrets identified in this book, it is hard to believe when reading this book. The writing of this book is neither with ""brevity"" nor with ""clarity."" I am disappointed with how this book was rated, after buying and spending time reading it."
3,Good stuff if you can stick to it and find it,I wanted to like this book and kept reading and putting it down and then picking it up and got through it but had to really work at it. There are lots of stories and thats good. Too much high tech examples from the BAy area for me. While there are many successes there there is also so much hype you have to make sure his examples are for real. If you have the patience to stick with it his 10 'Secrets' are certainly sound but not new but many of his examples leave you wondering. Okay read but dont expect something new.
3,"A good, but basic read","If you haven't read other books on communications, this might be an interesting one for you. However, if you are a seasoned communicator, I would skip it."
5,Fantastic resource.,"I purchased the book in search of some inspiration and direction in order to prepare of an up coming presentation. Not only did it help revise my presentation, the 10 Secrets have dramatically re-shaped the way I address audiences and conduct business.Refreshing insight and a fantastic resource.Thanks Carmine !"
3,Love at a Distance,"The love story at the core of this novel is gleaned only with readerly patience and a certain tolerance for the ""editorial"" (the editor is in fact the author of the whole thing) gimmick of ""entries."" If emotions are chaotic, the shape of this work is not. The fussy details are often wonderful, as is the story. But the stubborn structure of this book - the ""Encyclopedia"" form - serves to distance the subject and her object in much the same way that it distances the reader from the author, who in fact has a lot to say that is important. The story is pure tragedy. Well worth reading, and disturbing on several levels."
3,this tool bag is huge,"i didn't realise how big this bag was .. it is really huge. it will hold everything, but it weighs so much! also there is no tape measure holder.. and no deep pockets."
4,Love It!,"I work in the installation field and this bag is the best tool bag I have come across. If you're in the installation field with tools and small parts to carry around this one is for you. I have used this CLC bag for 5 years now. The only down fall in 5 years I have had 2 bags due to the bottom wearing out. CLC if your listening add a rubber bottom to the bag and the bag would last longer, but overall still awesome!"
1,Disappointed,No noticeable benefit from using this product. Instructions for use are very vague. I had to call the company for clarity on their limited directions.
4,Copper Fruit Mold,"I received this in good order, however the packing paper was stuck to the mold and looked like it was packed wet. They put a protective coating on the copper which you need to take off if you actually use it. I bought it really just for looks to put on my copper pot rack. So some of the protective covering shows up a little defective. I may just go ahead and use the solution to remove it then it would look nicer. Other than that, I am very happy with the mold."
4,Good product,Bought this product because I love one of the songs on the CD. A friend of mine also loves it.
3,"Accomodates a large number of finches, but too difficult to clean","I have a LOT of goldfinches. I can have as many as 12-14 finches at a time, so I needed a large feeder. I fill this feeder usually weekly, so I go thru a lot of food. I really feel Droll Yankees makes the best, so I bought this feeder. I noticed there was some mold near one of the lower perches. I immediately emptied out the feeder and made an effort to clean it. NIGHTMARE! The 10 perch rods run thru the center, so using a brush to clean the bottom wasn't happening, assuming you own a 36 inch brush. I tried filling up the tube, but the water leaked out the ports. To make a long story short, I was unable to clean the feeder, so I purchased a new Droll Yankees onyx everclean nijer feeder. It is 24 inches and has only 9 perches, but at least the birds won't get ill from the mold. The feeder is otherwisse well made - just impossoble to clean. Hope this review helps!"
3,Not squirrel proof,"These do attract and feed a lot of birds.However, squirrels will gnaw the narrow seed ports bigger. If you have squirrels, you need to get a thistle feeder with metal around the holes (Amazon sells at least one).If it wasn't for the squirrel problem, I would rate this as 5 stars."
2,Not squirrel proof,"We bought this feeder to leave at our place in the country. We filled the feeder with Nyjer seed and enjoyed watching the finches discover it. We went home and returned in 3 weeks to find that the feeder tube had been chewed through, not just at the ports, but almost all the way around the bottom of the tube, completely ruining it. We have two other droll yankee Onyx feeders that we've used at the same location for a long time, without problems. Looks like we need to try the armored thistle feeder instead."
3,Decent but horribly overpriced,"The Rosetta stone program is an immersion style learning package that, while thorough and technically adequate, fails to deliver enough value to justify it's lofty price tag.My recommendation to anyone interested in this software is to go to the Rosetta Stone website and sign up for a month of access to the online version. You will have access to the entire package contents and can make a determination as to whether it is something worth making such a large investment in. Personally I found it immediately boring and not much better than a glorified flash card program. Yes it has audio which is definitely valuable and what is there is good but I can't imagine anyone, after spending a month or two with this software, wanting to spend three hundred dollars on it."
4,Excellent Mozart Cycle at Bargain Price,"I have to chime in regarding the other review here. Is it remotely acceptable to hear a few online samples and then bash the recording? Clearly, that reviewer had an agenda.I own the entire Mozart Piano Concerto cycle with Derek Han, and although it is not ideal, it is an excellent set. With bargain prices from Brilliant Classics for the complete set, it's hard to pass up. Han's playing is simple, clear, and concise. The recording and remastering, although a little bland and lacking in detail, is nonetheless consistently good. You can pay four times as much for another cycle, but it won't be markedly better than this one. Skip the single discs, go straight for the complete set, and enjoy without the guilt of a major purchase."
1,A bust,"Ok, I confess, I didn't listen to the whole CD, just the clips provided by Amazon. Truth is, all I had to do was listen to the first two bars of #16, to know that this cycle is a bust. Flaccid, too slow, no fire, no juice. Boring. This thing is supposed to get up and GO!!! with lots of blood. These guys all sound like they just swallowed a bottle of 'ludes. Avoid it.Good alternatives for a complete cycle: Bilson/Gardiner; Anda/Mozarteum Orchestra. Also, Schiff and Vegh in selected concertos; Staier and Concerto Koln in selected concertos. The Hogwood/Levin set is supposed to be good, but from what I've heard, Bilson/Gardiner beats them handily. Still, worth a listen."
2,Average,"This game plays fairly average to me, I was expecting something far more interesting, instead I get a game with repetitive gameplay and a much linear story. Its not a terrible game its just that theres nothing innovative enough to impress me."
4,Amazing!,I played through both Onimusha games and loved both of them. This one is the best by far!! The opening cinema scene could be put up against anything Square Soft has ever done. I played for 7 hours straight and I still want more. Just a great game!
2,jesus christ,"This is a terrible game. I am a /huge/ fan of the first two Onimushas, and their smashing, wild successes tricked me into buying this one. The controls, the characters, the story, the additions, the settings, the sounds, the graphics -- everything is wrong or off or outright terrible. Don't make my mistake.I've also watched a friend play all of Onimusha 4. If you've played the first two and you're looking for more, it's safe to purchase that one. It's not nearly as good as the first two, and in some ways it's different enough that it probably should be even called part of the Onimusha series, but at least it doesn't suck. Skip this product; it's for your own good.I gave it 2 stars overall because it contains Samanosuke, and he deserves some amount of credit for simply existing."
2,what kind of trilogy is this??,"This game wasn't as fascinating as other Onimusha games. Onimsusha:Warlords had it good times 'cause it was the first time we see Samonosuke in battle agains evil.In Onimusha:Samurai's Destiny, a new young Samurai Jubei Yagyu rise to stop the evil Nobunaga.In this final ""chapter"", players will be disappointed that only one of the classic samurai (Samonosuke) is in played, but Yubei isn't. Instead is replaced with some simple character.I would suggest to rent this game first and find your own opinion about the game. If you're a Onimusha fan and just want to have for your private collection. I would think twice before purchasing it."
4,Onimusha 3: Demon Siege,"A awesome game, the best in the Onimusha series, at least I think it is. Found it new here, arrived ahead of time and in excellent condition. Love playing this game."
5,Like killing things with swords? I sure do.,The story isn't too bad and the gameplay is very excellent. The cutscenes showed people getting brutally sliced by japanese demons so I thought that was pretty cool. A very nice samurai game.
2,"No jump button, No kick button","Before I purchased this, I thought that it was going to be one of the best action games ever. After playing, I was disappointed. It's a very ""AVERAGE"" game, that doesn't have anything special to make it stand out from other games.I found it very weird that there is no jump function. The only way to kill air-born enemies is to shoot them with a bow n arrow. This can be tedious since you have to stop and stand still, then use the lock on target button.And since there is no jump, you can NOT jump in the air and perform hard landing attacks.There is also no kick button. Kicks would have added a little more variety to the attacks.You should buy God of War instead. It's a LOT more fun and exciting than onimusha 3."
4,AWESOME game to play on the SONY PLAYSTATION 2,"Onimusha 3: Demon Siege is going to be a AWESOME game to playI give it 5 Stars ""Highly Recommended"" Really WORTH TO BUY & play this on the Sony Playstation 2 game systemCapcom makings GREAT games for all 4 game system (Keep the good job up Capcom)"
1,Not so good,when i got this game i thought it was going to be cool but it wasent it sucked balls thats all i have to say.
1,BOOOOOOOOO!!,"Tis all crud and lies.This makes me sick to my stomach.How come Oda is EVIL!!! He was not evil!!! And whats with this Akechi character. Thats not his real name!!! It was Mitsuhide Akechi, who was an underling of Oda until he wished to kill Oda because he thought Oda was handling things wrong. In the end he got killed for it!!! This game is terrible and is so incorrect!!!If Akechis name was right and Oda wasnt evil then this game would get 2 or maybe even 3 stars but since its not i want to BURRRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!IT IS THE WORST GAME EVER!!!!!"
3,Boring,"This game is the same thing from the past 2 games, it becomes boring, the same exact story line but with 1 new character that is all"
4,good book,"This is also a helpful book for those who are interested in how science and theology go together. Note that it is framed about the question, ""what will happen at the end of the world?"""
2,Only for intellectuals.,"The author is an intellectual thinker and speaks that language well. It's no surprise then that his audience will be other intellectuals. While the author talks over my head, there are many who can appreciate his writing. Afterall, it's not a sin to have an extensive vocabulary or high I.Q.!!! Only God can speak the language of 'all' people."
3,Way too sensitive,"I agree with the other reviews. This thing needs an off switch. Each night, I try to quietly pick up all the toys after the kids are in bed and it never fails, this loud thing goes off just by the movement of me putting another toy in the basket with it. It is extremely annoying and has been banished from the play room!"
3,Gerber Multi-tool,"The tool is great other than the ""NEW"" Tungsten Carbide replaceable cutting inserts. The first rusty old fence I tried to cut the inserts crumbled like stale bread. The old tools without the inserts cut through thousands of pieces of wire without a single problem."
2,Good Music over Priced,"Although this CD has some pretty cool music on it, its way over priced and this was a good price for what its going for everywhere else and its still to much."
4,mostly very good,mostly good songs for children. some seem a little too discordant and not great for very young listeners.
3,Cute Toy,"My son recieved this toy as a gift for his first birthday. It is a really cute toy however my son never showed much of an interest in it, he did not seem amused by it in the least bit."
1,Not what I expected.,"I have a 19 month girl and purchased this toy for her 1st birthday. She loves to push things around. However, this toy does not steer, so she won't push it. And it is too wide for her to really scoot around on. She has way more fun with the $8.00 stroller I bought for her baby doll. I would not purchase this toy again."
1,WARNING!!!!! DON'T BUY,"My daugter got this for her first birthday. She loved it so much. Well, she got tired of it so we put it away. Then when my daughter turned 22 months old we brought it back out. Well with in 10min. of playing with the hippo, w/ his handel up, my daughter feet got stuck! I MEAN STUCK. SHe got both of her feet trapped in the top opening of the part where the block pop up out of. it took us over 45 min. to get her unstuck. By the time that we got her ancles out, they were brused and bleeding. She also had a ""dint"" in both of her legs. We could not believe it! I wish that I could post the pic. that we took of this. I don't ever want to see another child to go through this! My daughter has been in so much pain since then. It just broke my heart. So if you do get this, keep the seat down.***UPDATE, I POSTED PIC OF MY DAUGHTERS FEET IN THE CUSTOMERS PICTURES****** If you would like to see the after, feel free to e-mail me"
2,Is Boring,"I bought this toy for my son last christmast... He never has used it.. never ever.. First of all, this Hipo never gobble up the blocks. sometimes, my son used it to carry othter toys... Using as a ride vehicle is pretty unconfortable, because you cannot drive, or move it direction as easy as you do with a car, or motorcycle."
1,Don't waste your money!,Looks like a great concept but this toy just takes up space and will end up in your garage sale just as ours did.
1,Cheaply Made,"We got this for our 9 month old to help him with cruising. We returned it after 1 day of use. Our son could not get up on it without it falling over and when he could the thing didn't let him move forward easily. Also, it was hit or miss if the block would get gobbled up or not. Definately, not worth the money!"
3,Not a big hit...,"I bought this toy last christmas for my then 7 month old son. At the time he wasn't crawling... or walking... He has never played with it. When he was learning to walk he would rather just hold on to household things (tables, chairs... so on). I tried to get him to use it as a ride on... but that didn't work either. It is too low to the floor and too wide. He is too tall to sit on it and make it move. I am getting rid of it. I have already bought him a new ride on for this christmas... which I hope he will be able to ride."
4,Gobble 'N Go Hippo is a hit!,"We got this toy for my 9 month old son. He doesn't walk yet but this toy is helping him work on his gross motor skills. First, he pushed it along while crawling. Now, he stands up and uses it to cruise for a few steps. It isn't the most sturdy toy for beginning walkers because it is fairly light and lifts off the ground really easily. He plays with the blocks separately for now, but one of his friends who walks already enjoyed using the hippo to pick up the blocks. We also own the rounds and we found that the hippo actually has an easier time of picking those up. My son really likes to play with this toy. Sometimes he tries to chew on it. Other times, he likes to put things in it or to take stuff out. It is a really cute toy and I can tell that it will only become more fun for him as he gets older."
2,Disappointed,"We bought this at Christmas for our 1 year old. The age says up to 36 months,no way. My small for her age 2 1/2 year old is too big for this. We were disappointed because it is pretty small so there is not a lot of room to grow, it only picks up the blocks some of the time, and it really needs some kind of back support. The blocks have to be in exactly the right position. We will be returning this. Too bad, it looks cute on the box anyway."
3,not for some,"Hi, i only recently bought a gobble and go for my 10 month old son. He loves the blocks, as we already have the incredicube, and a few packs of blocks. As for the hippo, he wasn't all too impressed with it. Yes it is durable and sturdy, but it's too heavy and not easy enough to move, so like another reviewer said once he got to the wall with it, forget it, he will not touch it again. I returned mine because $74.95 is a lot of money for a toy that wil not get the attention and play out if it. (I live in Australia, that's why it cost's so much more)I instead bought the stride to ride walker also by fisher price that is a god send and he hasn't been able to leave it alone since i took it out of the box."
3,its ok,"my daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday. I'm glad I didn't spend the money on it.Blocks: She loves the blocks. We talk about the food inside and she loves shaking them to hear the rattle. she also builds with themas a push toy: OK. it is so big it is difficult for her to turn, so once she runs into something she is done.It doesn't pick up the blocks well. a great idea but not functional. does not work at all on smooth floors (hard wood or tile) and only sometimes on the carpet... if you can push it far enough, but usually the blocks just slide around under the mouth.as a ride on it is poor. she loves sitting or standing on it but it is so wide that she can barely touch the ground and push. She is tall for her age and still has difficulty with this. She gets very upset that she cant get it to move. she loves standing on it. because the seat is wide, low to the ground it doesnt tip! I generally don't let her do this but hey she had to find some way to play with this toy."
3,Cute...but disappointed!,We got this as a christmas gift for our son who just turned one. I really thought this would be cute but I have to agree that the blocks have to be lined up in order for it to gobble them up. The handle is small and the whole thing to me is just not made strong enough. My son does play with it but he has trouble moving it around. We also received the Fisher Price Playzone walker which I highly recommend instead.
4,Great riding toy,"My 18 month old loves riding this toy & looking at the blocks, but mine doesn't pick up any of the blocks. Even my older kids tried it. Otherwise it's easy on & off & fun for them."
2,Not what I expected!,"We are huge peek a block fans in our home, so when this toy came out, I went right out and got it for our daughter's first b-day. We played with it right away, but I was not impressed! Of course the blocks are great, but Mr. Hippo doesn't eat up his food like he is supposed to, my daughter has a hard time pushing him cause the handle is small, and to top it off, she has a hard time riding on him cause she is very tall and just can't move her legs right when she is on him. As excited as I was to purchase this toy, I will be returning it as soon as I can. We are going to get her something a little more suitable. I would not reccommend this toy, and am kind of disappointed by Fisher Price with this toy. (I am still a huge fan of Fisher Price though!)"
3,Not for Hardwood Floors....,"This is a super cute toy and we couldn't wait to get it home and try it out. Unfortunately our whole house has hardwood floors and the blocks don't ""pop"" into the belly unless you run the toy over them really fast. We took it over to grandma's house and tried it on her carpeted floors and it worked better but the blocks still get stuck. (Fisher Price should've used a harder plastic for the prongs inside the mouth to force the blocks into the belly, the soft rubber just bends.) It also rolls a little too fast for my 10 month old who is just learning how to walk. However his 16 month old cousin absolutely looooves it and runs all over the house sucking up the blocks and anything else that will fit in the hippos mouth."
5,Fisher-Price has done it again.,"My husband and I saw this toy at a local Babies'r'us, and after some thinking we bought this for our 9-month old son. I could not be happier. My son is learning to walk and this toy gives him the confidence to take those first few steps. I really like the fact that any of the peek a blocks can be gobbled-up by the hippo, and this toy can grow with him. I just wish more companies would make quality safe toys for children to play with. We are a Fisher-Price family and will continue to be as long as they keep up the good work!"
4,"great toy, but some flaws","We got this for my daughter when she was 6 months old. At that time she loved just playing with the blocks. Now she is walking with it and loves it. It is hard to get turned around, so we have to help her with it. She likes to sit on it too but is still too short. My 4 year old loves it too, and they both end up playing with it together. My 4 year old will lay out the blocks for th 10 month old to gobble up. The only other flaw is that once you get a couple of blocks in there, sometimes the other ones won't go in unless you move them around. But overall it is very durable , cute and lots of fun!"
2,Gobble 'N Go - Even if it's only in a straight line,"I bought this toy for my 14 month old son who was cruising, but not walking hoping it would encourage him to start walking. The gobbling part worked pretty well and even picked up other small toys. However, the hippo doesn't turn easily at all, so once he ran out of space in the straight line he was walking it was all over. It's not much fun to play with a toy for a few seconds then have to have Mom turn it around so you can play for a few more secondsMy son has since started walking - no thanks to the handful of times he used the hippo- and I have tried converting it to a ride on. The base is pretty wide and he hates sitting on it.All in all, it was a waste of $25."
3,Not the greatest,My son got this for a gift on his first birthday. He loves the blocks that go with this toy but the hippo is left unattended. He'll use it as a seat or stand in it but it doesn't really grab the blocks unless you line them up a certain way. He grew bored of this toy in a matter of minutes. I don't recommend the hippo but the blocks are absolutely great.
2,Lasting Entertainment Value = Nill,"I was so excited to purchase this, thinking it would last forever since it converts to a ride toy. But the hippo just wasn't hungry enough for us. We had to run over blocks a couple time to ""finish"" the gobbling mechanism, and even then the toy doesn't work that great on carpet. And the blocks have to be spaced farther apart to get gobbled up, something our young one just doesn't understand yet. The hippo isn't that great for pushing the other way either, which a learning child is prone to do. The one thing this toy has going for it? It's silent. But if you don't mind songs, I suggest the LeapFrog Learning Band Walker instead. I should have known LeapFrog would have been better anyway since our young one likes all their other toys too."
2,VERY Disappointed,"My mother-in-law bought this for my son for his first birthday after I suggested he might like it. Boy was I wrong. The moment we opened it the hippo looked smaller and cheaper then it did on the box. I'd been eyeing this toys since my son was only a few months old and now we finally have, I am so disappointed. Like another review said, my son can't even move the hippo when he is riding on it, it sits too close to the ground. Pushing it doesn't even interest my son. Gobbling the Peek-A-Blocks, well if I can't get him to ride on it or push it, the gobbling action is worthless. This hippo has sat in the corner of our dining room from day one, the only thing my son does like about it are the blocks. My son loves Peek-A-Blocks, we have the train, the dump truck, Popity the Elephant and the IncrediBlocks toys, all of those are better made and hold my sons interest much longer then the hippo. For the money you can do MUCH better in the Peek-A-Block line."
3,not so hip,"I was eager to buy this hippo for my 12 month old son. I am a big peek-a-blocks fan and I thought this hippo was the epidemy of cute. Well, it is cute. And that's about it. My toddler son has never expressed any interest in this toy AT ALL. He has enjoyed other peek-a-block toys, especially the train, giraffe and elephant. This hippo has been a big bummer. I think the main problem for us is that my son has been walking since he was 10 months old. He doesn't have any use or desire for a walker toy. I can see where this toy may be a hit for kiddos needing assistance walking.My three year old has tried to play with it a few times but he gets very frustrated with it. It does not pick up blocks very well at all, and it can only pick up six blocks. After 6 blocks the belly is full and it won't pick up any more until those six are removed. Big bummer!"
4,Great toy!,"My six month old loves this toy as a push walker. We have carpet and I don't think I'd let a child who cannot walk unassisted push this on tile as the one time she got into the bathroom she slid around and it was dangerous. The toy is also failry light weight so a small child can cause it to flip over. This isn't a problem on our carpeted floor, however, a child could get injured on a hard surface if not attended. Overall we LOVE this toy, and it has saved me from having to walk around holding my child's hands up all day. Now all I have to do if flip her around when she reaches the end of the living room.**My child uses this toy only with close supervision."
2,"No Gobble, No Go","We got this toy as a gift for my 7 month old son. He was a late starter with sitting because of his weight, so crawling and walking hasn't happened yet. I found that there was no place for his legs to go when sitting on the hippo. The seat is also very small, causing him to lurch forward over the ""handle bar"" and ""hood"" of the hippo. Also, the hippo doesn't really pick up the blocks very good unless they are positioned directly in front and center AND if you push it backwards, some blocks fall out. I gave it 3 stars for fun because my son likes to bang on it and 5 stars for durability."
2,Hippo doesn't gobble.,"We received this for our daughter's first birthday. She loves the blocks, but the hippo doesn't eat. She gets most of her fun by standing on top of it. I know this toy is very sellable based on us folks who grew up with Hungry Hungy Hippos. That is a good memory. But pass on this toy for your toddler. Overpriced and can get A MUCH BETTER WALKER for less."
2,Only works on thick carpet,"We bought this for our son for his first birthday, he does love it but it does not gobble up the blocks, most of our home is hardwood floors and flat carpet, it only picks up the blocks on the high pile carpet. It's fun for him to push around and ride on but doesn't do what it was made to do."
3,"Cute idea, but beware!","We bought this Hippo for our 13 month old son a few weeks ago. He really likes riding it and loves playing with the blocks. Biggest problem: When the seat is up, he has gotten stuck across the open part more than a few times. If he leans over it when it's open, he gets stuck and can't get up on his own! He becomes very agitated and scared. It's a good toy, but this WILL happen, unless you always keep the seat down."
3,Doesn't hold my 15 month old son's interest,"This hippo looks great in the add. But, it doesn't hold my 15 month old son's interest. He loves to push things so I thought he would love it. But it's akward and bulky and it doesn't push that easily, so he doesn't really push it that much. It is also not very sturdy. It seems like it's made of cheap plastic. The block picking up action isn't as exciting as I would have hoped. On a positive note, my son loved the blocks that came with it. They are see through and have interesting things in them. But you can buy these type of blocks separetely. In my opinion this hippo is not worth the price."
2,Disappointed in ride-on feature,"This looks so cute, and is great as a push toy for beginning walkers, however, it is impossible for my 18 month old to ride. When she sits on the seat, the ears and the edge of the head are right at her knees. There is a thin edge of plastic at this part of the head that hurts her legs if she moves her legs to try to ride on the toy. This is poor design. If you only look at this as a walking toy, it is great. When my daughter was learning to walk, I liked that it didn't turn at all. Now that she is older, her lighter weight walker is better, because she can turn it on her own."
3,she likes it but she cant turn it at all,We bought this for our 10 month old and she liked it right off the bat. The only thing is you cant turn it at all.So instead of giving us a little break on our backs we have to follow her every where to turn it even if its just an inch.When she wants to ride it we have to push it for her but you have to be on your hands an knees the whole time and there really isnt a handle for you to push with.I would have bought a different one if I would have known.But its really cute and she does loves it.
2,Hard to ride,"I didn't care for this toy. The hippo is very wide and bulky making it difficult for young children to ride on. The gobble part didn't work all that great either. I had other similar toys that served the same purpose, so I chose not to keep this one around taking up space."
4,My son loves pushing this around,"I bought this 2nd hand for our son, who would sit on the floor and cry until someone helped him walk. He is 10 months old and LOVES pushing this up and down the house.The house we are renting has very cheap carpeting with no cushion whatsoever. It creates no drag on the hippo, but the toy doesn't seem to get away from him either and he only occasionally has trouble pulling himself up to it.The gobble feature works ok if you have enough speed or give it enough time. DS is not really interested in gobbling toys or playing with the blocks. He just wants to walk, walk walk.My only complaint is that he can't really steer it (even if he knew where he wanted to go!). So when he hits a wall, he yells for one of us to turn it for him.Thanks to other people who have posted safety concerns. That has not been a problem for us, but it is good to be aware of the possibility."
3,Not the best option,"This toy sits around our house. I'm trying my hardest to prevent the clutter so I'll probably end up giving it away. The fact that the wheels don't click, lock or slow down makes it hard for my toddler to learn to walk. The toy gets away from him and then smack...right on his face. One time of that and it was all over. I also thought he'd enjoy the toy factor, but he's shown little interest. Luckily I got it for a discounted rate over the holidays. However, I'd recommend choosing another option for the ""learning to walk"" phase."
3,"Great to walk, but hard to ride","We got this for our little one at around 8 months (he was already starting to walk using the furniture), and he loved it for walking, especially putting other things in the tummy ""basket"". However, now at 18 months, he is trying to ride it and often gets frustrated.The whole ""gobble"" feature doesn't interest him in the least, and frankly doesn't work that well. He has already bent two of the flaps (he turns it upside down for inspections now and again).Riding is impossible on carpet, only a bit better on tiles, and our son being tall, his knees are practically in his face when he pushes off. Also, he can't turn it around on his own, so resorts to reverse when encountering obstacles. We tried it outside on paved area, and it only works if it is completely smooth and no debris at all.Great if they are learning to walk, otherwise wait and get a proper ride-on."
3,"something missing, but can't put my finger on it.....","for some reason, i thought there was going to be more to this then there is. my daughter enjoys it, walks around with it all the time, but it's not her favorite. i don't know, maybe some lights and songs or something would spruce it up.and to the lady who's kid got their feet stuck in it...first, it is very unlikely in my opnion, second, where were you when it happened (nuff said), and third, why the hell are you taking pictures of it instead of helping your child out if it was such a horrific experience."
3,Too fast or too slow in walker mode,"We LOVE these blocks - they are all over the house. So we bought this for our daughter when she started to stand (8 months). She is now 12 months and shows very, very little interest in this toy. On carpet, she cannot push it. On wood floors, it goes way too fast (seems dangerous). Its handle is also just a little too short for her (and she's in the 50th %). But, our 6 year old son thinks this is the best toy ever (go figure). Maybe she will like it more when she is into ride-ons. But for now, she gets upset if you try and push her on it. I suppose it has to do with the temperment of the baby. Ours hates being in her walker with a passion but loves the toys attached to it, so maybe she just dislikes any toy meant to encourage walking and wants free reign. It did run over her foot once and that was scary, so for that I am only giving it 3 stars. Otherwise, nice concept and very cute."
3,Kinda Sucky,"I bought this for my 9 month old son, And he liked walking with it, But if you arnt COMPLETLY centered on a Block it doesnt pick up! I returned it the next day."
3,OK....but better if picked up blocks,"My son received this for his 1st Birthday...he liked the blocks more than the Hippo. It doesn't pick up the blocks on the wood floor. My 4 yr old tried it on the carpet...and he was only able to get it to pick up 1 block. It is OK, but after seeing it's lack of performance...I wouldn't buy it. The Wagon in this series is much more fun."
2,Great concept but received no playtime from my twins!,My twin girls received this for their 1 year birthday (just in time for them to be taking their first steps!) The concept of gobbling up the blocks was cute (to me) but my daughters never showed any interest in it. They both sat on it and moved it around but quickly became bored. IMPORTANT NOTE: If all you have is tile or wood floors- forget it! The gobble action only worked for us on carpet!
3,Awkward to manipulate,"My son received this for his 1st birthday. He is now 19 months and he has always had difficulties in trying to maneuver this toy. It isn't a good ride on, especially if your child is on the short side like our son is. Even when he did learn how to push w/ his feet, he had trouble getting his feet around the hippo's feet. It has no steering mechanism, so it is very hard to turn it when they reach a dead end or to try to maneuver it to run over and gobble up the blocks. My son really likes this toy, but spends more time getting frustrated with not being able to turn it. We're in the market for a decent, maneuverable ride-on, because this isn't it."
2,Nice concept but Not worth it.,We bought this toy for our daughter of 12 mos. she seemed to be more interested in putting the blocks in her self rather than gobbling them. When she does ride on it her heels and ankles get caught under it.
3,Average Twist-Grip Shifter,"While I prefer Shimano shifters, only the left side shifter was broken on a used 2001 Schwinn Frontier I picked up cheap. I wasn't about to spend extra money to convert both L/S and R/S to Shimano on this old of a bike. I bought mine at my LBS and it's the ""micro"" shifter vs. the ""index"" shifter. It doesn't quite match the the looks of the o.e. shifter - but this is a much newer model. So far it works quite well. This is my second bike I just use for short trips in the neighborhood. Photos above..."
5,Perfect low cost replacement,"I recently got back into cycling, and have been refurbishing my old Specialized Rockhopper for commuting and weekend rides. First issue, the old SRAM gripshifts had decayed and left a nasty residue on my hands, and my rear shifter had broken so it only would go between 3 gears. Looking online for a direct replacement, I found this on Amazon. They're cheap, they honestly look a bit cheap (plasticy), but they work great and are surprisingly solidly made. Easy to install (10 minutes work), my only criticism is that it would have been nice if they threw in a cable end to finish the installation job. Other than that, top notch for the part-time cyclist."
5,Truly Awsome Performance!,"Always when I listen to Kubelik's accounts of Maher Symphonies, I can sense his immense respect and passion for the music. This vibrant live performance of Titan, recorded stereo in 1979 with Bavarian Radio SO, is no exception.Not just the titanic grandeur and sublime beauty of playing which stands out, but also the inner pulse and energy he generates from each instrument create exceptionally rich listening experience.Reasonablly well recorded with enough presence and space. Well worth adding to your Mahler collection. Why did they cut applause out!!"
5,it worked for me!,"after smoking a pack a day (two packs a day on weekends) for 17 years and quitting and relapsing innumerable times, i finally succeeded using this method. i have been an ex-smoker now for 4 1/2 years!!! the arguments here give you the rationale to combat addict thinking and overcome the mental tricks your addiction uses to get you to start smoking again. i bought this book after my father and step-mother used it to quit about 7 yrs ago (they are both still ex-smokers). i had it on my shelf for a year and one day i decided to quit smoking and i grabbed the book and read it instead of buying another pack of cigarettes. i haven't had one puff since. i recommend buying it and let it sit on your shelf til you are ready."
3,Wide jaw?,"I bought the clamp and the wide jaws at the same time. I was very dissapointed with the size of the ""wide jaws"". They measure 3/4 x 3 3/4 inches. I expected them to be much larger. You can add to them with wood using the screw holes provided. How ever if you get the clamp you will defenitly need the wide jaws to use it."
4,Does the job,"Works well, but the description needs to be changed as this does not include the rubber face to protect the wood, which was my main reason for buying this."
5,Excellent cutting edge guide,Clamps strongly. No flex. Provides a near perfect edge to guide my wormdrive saw for ripping sheet goods - ply and MDF.I plan on buying the longer 99 inch version next. These seem to be a great bang for buck for panel cutting versus far more expensive dedicated panel cutting systems.
5,ripping neccesity,was able to enhance the clamp bracket to work on 48 inch plywood. the clamp bracket is not much good without it . works great now and would reccommend it to anyone trying to rip cut a wide area of wood.
1,Don't bother with these,"I wouldn't bother with these. The ""wide"" clamps are only as wide as the track itself, about 4 inches.If you really wanted a wide clamp, you could take a trip of plywood or hardwood, and screw it onto the guide bases instead of these clamps.Also, when mounted they result in the built in ruler on the guide to be off by about 1/4 inch, which is inconvenient.Finally, the original packaging was very poor. The plastic has become brittle and broken open, and one of the mounting screws had almost fallen out."
1,"Good idea, poor design.","If you use these wide jaws on the straight edge to guide a saw, the jaws will be cut by the saw."
2,Image may cause misunderstanding,I believe resseler should change the product's image on Amazon.The picture can take customer to understand that they will have the rule also.
4,Useful but price is too high,"I found this item to very useful when used with the All In One 50"" clamp. As stated by other purchasers, this item should be part of the clamp. Although useful, I feel that this item is over priced at $17.15. I was a little surprised when I received these fixtures and saw what they actually consisted of. As stated the price of the clamp could be increased slightly and include the fixtures with it. If the fixtures were sold by themselves, a price of below $10.00 might be more acceptable. I would rate these fixtures with 5 stars if were not for the price."
1,clams dont clamp,"My wife purchased these all in one XWJ clamps clamps for me for x-mas I was very excited to try them as I like to use new and inovative tools. I found that the clamps do not hold, after multiple attempts and reading the instructions over and over I determined that these are a waste of time and money as the locking bar will not hold it just slides.I am not sure how it was determined that these have any clamping power they just wont clamp no mater what I try."
2,necessary but shouldn't be,"ALL of this manufacturer's clamps are badly designed. The jaws are too shallow to work as a clamp effectively. The wide jaws add about 1/3"" to the depth and substantial width. They are quite effective although in the last analysis they should not be necessary. They salvage an otherwise nearly useless straight edge so it is a bit usable as a clamp."
2,Just the Jaws ONLY,"I wonder if people realize that this item is ONLY for a set of wide jaws and NOT for the clamp!I don't own this, but see it atop the best selling list (at this time) and after a couple of minutes of looking at it I realized that this offering was NOT for the clamp ... I would wager that most purchasers thought it was for the clamp ... the product page is a bit misleading."
2,2- Pack means one item,Didn't use the jaw fixture since I don't own the Clamp yet.(Product is not a 2-in-one jaw + clamp; so ended up returning).
4,"slight lag, otherwise great!!","The watch is just what I expected: such a clear crystal and a fantastic feeling!! The only glitch I have noticed is that there is a slight lag in the watch, with the minute hand going back a tad every day, making it just short of perfect... The problem is that I got it from Spain and thus the Amazon Warranty is a bit of a pain to use..."
5,Al D,I am extremely pleased with the watch -- I like the style and ease of operation (doesn't have 500 functions -- just tells accurate time) and the delivery process was super. I wasn't home when they initially came in the AM and they came back later that day and delivered it.I'M THOROUGHLY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AND THE DELIVERY.
2,It's OK,"I found the book to be slightly outdated. I would, at minimum, conduct a search of other books on the same topic before purchasing this one."
5,vicks vapo rub ointment,"brilliant product a must have when your congested, try rubbing it on your feet as well before you sleepa family favourite and a must have in your winter first aid kit"
1,Decongestant? This is a congestant! And quite possibly the devil's tool...,"Of all the godforsaken products.. use the vaporub they said.. just spread a little along your nose they said.. my stuffy nose became a block of cement.. I could barely breath... as I spoke on the phone, the person on the other line believed I was breathing my last...I have never seen such an adverse effect, and have since heard corroborating reports from others. I would look elsewhere for relief. Even doing nothing is a superior option.The tingling along my nose was surely sign of a demonic entity entering my body. Oh what I wouldn't have given for an excorcist..."
5,VICKS has many GREAT uses LOVE IT!!!,"Besides the obvious, Vicks is used by me for Arthritis, severe Knee pain, shoulder & neck pain, foot pain, etc etc.....just rub it in & in a few minutes WALLA...what a difference. This was told to me a few years ago by my Dominican friends. She had a hugeee jar, purchased in a Bronx Bodega, not available here or anywhere that I know of. Anyhow, this 6 oz. jar goes a long way if used wisely. Not too much, use sparingly. Just enough to spread on the affected area.LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!"
5,Vicks,"Have used this product for years, due to sinus cogestion. The only thing that dissapoints me is that Proctor & Gamble manufacture it in Mexico!!Come on P & G, bring your opperations to the USA>"
1,"Complicated, horrible writing, tiny diagrams, flimsy tool","The order of topics in the book could hardly be less logical and the six point type on the diagrams means it's easy to skip a key fact. There are no bullet points or numbering, no prioritizing what facts are important. In fact, the book is filled with little advertisements for other products by the author. Almost half the book is filled with little projects and advice about miter boxes, etc.I have good vision and noting the degrees on the True Angle tool requires putting your head at a perfect angle to see the degree and within just a few inches of the tool. As others have mentioned the True Angle is truly flimsy and the nut is easily loosened while you try to measure."
5,Get Book and Support,"This book is very good and helpful. Best of all when I had really difficult situations and emailed asking for help, I got very prompt and accurate help. If I can use this, then anyone can."
3,maybe a liitle more difficult than it has to be?,"His presentation of simplectic groups ( although short) was helpful.That said having had Weyl'sSpace, Time, Matterfor many yearsI'm used to his notation, but here he is very intense in his presentationand somewhat less than clear. As he is the founder of gauge group theoryone expects some mathematics, just not where it seems more difficult than necessary?Also the, now, standard classifications of Cartan groups aren't mentioned ( although might bebecause of the original publishing date of 1939?).I got this book looking for the Weyl root groups used in making Cartan invariant matriceswhich I couldn't find.So on these points the book is a disappointment while still being a classic text."
2,Okay,"Even though the album is okay, they are not original. They tried unsuccessfully to duplicate Bone Thugs N Harmony's unique and original sound!"
1,Style Stealers!!!,"What is wrong with you people out there. You can just look at these pitiful dudes and see ther trying to be like Bone, let alone there music. I probably would have gave this album 1 more star if they didnt try to be like bone so much. Its obvious. Aight, peep dis: 4 members(just like bone),Fast rapping(just like bone),All have braids and long hair(just like bone). Thats how i break it down. Crucial Conflict is oppsessed with Bone Thugs. And to top it off, the style they tried to take from Bone, they messed up anyway. There music is garbarge, don't waste your money people. Go buy East1999 Eternal(BTNH). Now thats music, one."
4,Good,"They dont really sound like Bone Thug, they flow fast but that is it. Good album overall.Fav Tracks:HayThe Final Tic"
3,works well with some planning,"Nicely made, with plenty of storage, but if you fill all the wrench slots and load the various pockets with a full assortment of hand tools it weighs far too much to carry around, even without a power drill. I repair home appliances and found I have to leave out all but the items I use most often or I cant even lift it. So, with that in mind, I am working out how best to use it. It is well made, with strong stitching and tough material. Another issue is that when worn as a back back it slides off my shoulders, but that might be just me. Still not the ""perfect"" tool bag, I am going to keep looking I guess..."
3,Almost the perfect bag,"This bag has a pocket for most everything you could want to carry. I think one review said the pouches were shallow, I understand and agree with that statement. The fact there are so many helps me look past it though. However, what I can't look past is the fact that you can't secure the pack with cables through the eyelets of the zippers. I believe there are 5 compartments that have double zippers and ideally you could run a cable through each eyelet to provide some security for your tools, say if you had to check them in luggage on a flight. As it stands, you could probable buy 5 TSA locks to achieve this. I think they missed the mark on an otherwise perfect tool bag."
4,Good packpack but,"This packpack is well made and well organized.I bought one for myself and one for another tech.Every tool or part is wright at your finger tip. The only promblem is that their is not a computer sleve or compartment,the straps are not comfortable and when fully loaded it can be heavy and might hurt your back if you do alot of urban walking as I do.But don't get me wrong I do like this packback every much.I like having my hands free when going from account to account. and after a few days of use. I only pack the tools that I need instead of every tool I own."
2,dont waste your money,I had read some questionable reviews on this bag but I really liked the idea of a tool backpack for my job so I gave it a try. As a previous reviewer said its only good for short tools and thats true theres lots of pockets for 4 inch tools. Anyway after about two months of full time use the one of the zippers gave out. The straps on this thing are the same as the ones found on a normal backpack used for school. Overall the construction is light duty and is not at all comparable to my other clc bag. I want to check out http://www.toolpak.com/ but I cant find enough info on it to determine if its any better.
1,disappointed,"I ordered this item believing the picture and description but when I got the Item there was little area for my tools. After setting my screw drivers and wrenches there was no place for pliers, needlenose and others. the pockets were too small to fit any tools. Returned the Item because it was not what I was expecting."
1,useless for hand tool carrier,"I do my own work on my cars and around the house, and I keep my front-line hand tools in a shoulder bag so that I can move them around as needed. I was looking at this backpack so that I could get the tools clearly organized and onto my back (and off my shoulder) but it is useless for my needs. There is only one wall for wrenches so I have to choose metric or SAE and leave the other set behind. There is one wall with elastic straps that is good for screwdrivers and such but every other wall has closed-top pockets that do not close when filled with common tools like pliers and wire cutters. There is no good facility for storing socket sets and ratchets either. It seems well-made and would probably work well for things like roofing contractor who has to carry 20 different kinds of screws up a roof but it's useless as a general toolbag. Perhaps if they replaced the pockets with elastic and/or velcro straps it would be more useful. As it stands it's useless."
4,Please improve this product,"I am a marine electrician and have been using the tool backpacks since they've come out. The idea is great and there's room for most of my everyday hand tools but if I there was one thing I would change it would have to be the way the zippers and surrounding fabric is made. Over time once the bag breaks in the seems sag terribly and it puts so much strain on the zippers that they eventually begin to slip and seperate until you can't close them at all. Every one of my collegues owns one and will tell you the same thing. Once the zippers start missing, these backpacks are no longer dependable because you'll soon find tools missing that have fallen out. I understand this is good for CLC and Tool Pak because they'll sell more bags but when the inside of the bag still looks brand new I shouldn't be forced to repair or replace it due to a poor design on one very important part of the product. I'd love to see a better design in the future."
3,"impulse buy, but has its pluses","cons: won't zip shut if your drill is 14.4V or higher!! Compartments are too small. Unless you carry around a lot of small things, they are worthless. No labeling spots for little pockets: you will search a lot for your tape measure! Definitely gets heavy - the pack is too big. If you fill it, watch out. just OK construction, and for the amount of weight, this isnt good.pros: the zippers seem good. the different layers move like turning pages, works nice. nice to keep hands free if your going up a lot of steps or a ladder -that part works."
5,Best tool bag ever,I'm an industrial electrician and have tried all different types of tool bags and this backpack is by far the best I have tried it is big enough to fit all the tools I use most and then some I would definately recommend this bag to anyone who is tired of carrying a heavy tool bag on their shoulder
5,Great quality backpack,"This a a very heavy duty built bag, with many pockets for your tools, I'm a diesel technician and I can carry all the basics in it..."
5,Best Field Tool Box Around!,"Great product for commercial work!Perfect for people working on rooftops.Organized, Mobile and durable.This worked so well, I ordered a second one."
2,"Reliable, but disappointing.","I bought this watch (but with a black face) about 8 years ago. Its still ticking, but thats about the best I can say for it. The casing is stainless steel plated, but is actually made of brass. Some watches gain character as they get older and worn, but this one just starts to look cheap and shabby after a few months.Friends who own watches from Victorinox (who makes the REAL Swiss army knife) claim the crystal doesn't scratch as easily. I can't say how scratch resistant the Victorinox are, but my Wenger definitely has some prominent scratches on the crystal.Also, the luminescent paint on the hands no longer glows in the dark, even after prolonged exposure to bright sunlight. Maybe the lifespan is longer on other watches, but I'm not sure.In my experience, the battery in this watch needs replacement about every 3 years."
4,Love This Watch (Almost),"Great watch. Works fantastic. Two criticisms: band should be solid steel (this really makes a difference) and the illumination needs to last through the night. Glows nicely until 3 or so in the AM, then I can't read the time. So far, this has been the watch's biggest shortcoming."
4,"Smaller than it looks, cheap feeling box","It seems a pretty good watch. It is on the smaller side: my wrist is not very big but I would see how bigger wrists will find it small compared to the average male watch size. The box is nice but feels cheap, it actually makes you wonder if it is a REAL swiss watch inside.I'm quite happy, let's see how it holds over time."
1,Lousy Watch,"Don't buy this watch if you are a guy as it looks like a little girl's play watch. The pictures on line don't give you a proper sense of its dimensions. The watch is tiny and the numbers are tinier. I am going to have to return it, but it's going to cost me monty to ship it back. It makes me wonder if I should ever shop at Amazon again."
4,Good deal on a Gold Box special,"This is a nice watch for the present price of $89.99. Another e-seller, with a good rating, does have it on special for $83.00 with free shipping, at this time, but I'd buy it on Amazon because of their returns policy.As for the watch, it is a nice watch with a Swiss quartz movement, even though the bezel is fake and does not move. The watch is of a smaller size than what I'm use to wearing on my wrist, so I gave it to my wife. It did state on a couple of web sites that it is a unisex watch.So, for the lady in your life who needs a good, readable, dependable watch for work, this one, at this price, really can't be beat. And, if you are a man with a smaller wrist, it will look good on you also."
5,"Fantastic, the only substitute for seeing them live",I love this video! It really captures the energy and talents of this amazing band. The only things I wish are1. I wish it was put on DVD too!2. I wish Crisco was in it! :(Anyone who likes alternative rock will love Seven Nations and this video! I just want to watch it over and over again!
3,Too obscure!,"I was attracted to the cover of this book, and to the fame that the author enjoys. However, I was disappointed. It is not an easy read. I had a few moments of pausing to think about the concepts that he discusses (eg - how could the existence of the earth and our lives on it be just ""an accident"" with no meaning) and (eg - we are more than the genetic heritage that we leave behind when we die). But I found the book pretentious and unfocussed. The meaning is too covert. Who is the joker? Who are the elves? He has some interesting ideas about time-warp. How would things that we take for granted today (eg photographs) have appeared to people who lived in an earlier century, and conversely, how would something that may be commonplace in the future, appear to us now? But I found it encouraging the Gaarder makes a strong case for our existence beyond this world (after death) without using conventional religious language."
2,The Sweet Machine,"We purchased the product to promote a theme at the Medical Library. As a toy it is way to flimsy for practical use. It doesn't have the power to pickup anything much bigger than a marble and it is unusable if filled to a useful level. The battery life is short for three ""D"" cell batteries."
2,"Cute, but small","The machine is very small and only holds tiny, tiny toys. We played with it once and tossed it in the donate pile."
1,Makes a good paperweight,"I bought this a couple of years ago to keep on my desk at school. I thought it would be a good reward for my students. However, we couldn't get it to pick up something as lightweight as a Jolly Rancher. I ended up writing prizes on pieces of paper, having the students grab those instead and then handing out the prizes. It ended up being more of a hassle than it was worth."
4,The Sweet Machine,Works great with small candy boxes only. Anything large it will not it pick up. Its great fun for the challenge.
1,Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This item was broken right out of the box. I had read a few other reviews saying the same thing and I should have listened. I had a very sad little boy on Christmas morning...
5,Fun 4 Everyone !,"My daughter received the Sweet Machine for Christmas and just loves it. The on/off button for the music is a nice feature. From unpacking the Sweet Machine to set up, everything was easy. A fun gift at the right price makes everyone happy."
1,Didn't work out of the box,"I specifically chose this brand because, based on product reviews, it seemed to be better made than other models and I thought it was worth the extra expense to get a higher quality item. However, it didn't work out of the box - the claw wouldn't go up and down or open. My son was very disappointed. I am hoping the replacement will work.Well, I since received the replacement, which worked correctly for 3 minutes before the claw stopped opening. This toy is a piece of junk."
1,DIFFERENT BAND,This Heatwave album is not the same band as TOO HOT TO HANDLE band that made BOOGIE NIGHTS AND ALWAYS AND FOREVER !
3,"Decent progam, lousy online support.","This would definitely be the way to go with this company. I used the online version of this program for over a year and found it to be very helpful. When I ran into technical problems, however, the technical support was virtually non-existing. I had to cancel.The price is a bit steep, but the structure of the lessons and the features are very good. Get the CD and don't suffer the incompetent ""support."""
2,Learning German?,"Well, I spent a great deal of time with this program and learned a fair amount of vocabulary. However, when I arrived in Germany I quickly realized how little I was able to communicate. The sentence structure of German is far different than English, and therefore stringing vocabulary words together can only result in confusion and the Germans taking pity on you by replying in English. This program does not explain the sentence structure, the use of different cases or verb tenses. If you want to learn German, you must immerse yourself in the language. I found that watching English sub-titled movies was helpful. In summary, this was an expensive dictionary for my purposes."
2,consumer,"The product which is a CD rom will not install onto either one of my comupters, they sent directions (which were just photo copies) and have not been able to use it. I will have to take my computer and the CD to a computer store. I was not expecting to have to do all of that."
1,Propaganda marketing - Rip Off product,"I found this product to represent extremely poor value for money. I purchased the product based on all the marketing hype and testimonials. However, I have since come to the conclusion that these guys must pay people to write positive testimonials.This product only covers the basics (levels 1 & 2). Then they try to rope you into paying even more money for their intermediate levels.I have since purchased a cheaper 'Tell Me More' package (for Spanish) and have been highly impressed with the scope of it. They have packed so much more value into their package. And it is a complete package - all the way to advanced level.I think it's really disgusting that Rosetta Stone get away with selling such a seriously inferior product at such a highly inflated price and people still buy it. I think it borders on being a scam."
1,Escape: Fool Proof Guide to Camping,"No review other than it [stunk]. Main focus was two guys trying to be motivational. Useless- if one buys the video and watches it they are obviously already motivated about going camping. One thing useful, the checklist. Reason being I always add too much extra's when I make any kind of list. The camping (tour) guides in the video could have been more attractive. Not that it matters, because it does not. However when you have a useless video you can at least enjoy the scenery. If I wanted to see ugly guys trying to be funny I would go the the end of the steet corner on a Fri. night. However I do have advice; Ayone with half a brain would think twice before buying this piece of [junk]."
2,"NOT a Sony part, as described","This part is not by Sony, as described in the product listing when sold by A&JForever. I received the part and it seems like the tolerance for the housing is different than that of the Sony. It appears that the difference in size causes the connections to be slightly off and the lamp has been going on and off because of that. I contacted the seller, A&JForever, and they confirmed that it indeed is not an original part. I'm sure the bulb is fine, it's just that the overall quality in not as described."
1,wrong casing for lamp,"I bought this lamp by the application for a particular sony 60 xbr tv when i got the lamp installed it and did not work, after installation called tv repair man and he pointed out the lamp was not original sony and showed me that lamp was installed in casing which had different connector when plug in the tv would not make contacts so he had to use the lamp with different original casing by transfering the lamp in the old casing cost me $200.00 for service call If I would have bought this product from sony directly I would pay 60 more dollars but I could have installed myself and tv would work very disappointed with product sold as original sony equipment priduct"
3,Works good but...,"The owners manual states the hex wrench would be included with the replacement lamp. It was not. The replacement has phillips head screws. So, I had to hunt one down. When I searched online for the wrench's correct size there was an old review that listed it in a ""Whats in the box"" list. Luckily, I kept the bag of stuff that came with the Sony. Sure enough, there was a baggie with the correct wrench. Yahoo!Update Sep 21 2012.Bad news:It die tonight (I got it July 2011)Good NewsThe price drop by half. I just brought 2."
3,Seller is great but Sony should have made the TV better,The seller is fantastic and we get our merchandise on time and as expected. But this is the fourth bulb replacement that we have had to order. Sony should have built this TV better. These bulbs should have a longer lifetime.
1,Sad 1st Day,"My son was so excited to have a Spongebob ""wheely"" backpack, as he calls it. He has scoliosis and is not permitted to carry a regular backpack. Finding a Spongebob rolling backpack has not been easy! I ordered it and looked it over and all was fine until the morning of his first day of kindergarten. He wheeled it out into the driveway and out comes the handle and the tiny metal pieces that lock it in place went rolling off into the street. The only thing my husband would be able to do is put screws in there to keep the handle in. Not exactly why I paid so much for a backpack that is supposed to have a moving handle. The bag itself was fine but they need to work on the construction of the handles. My son is very upset because we have to return the bag."
3,Heads Up for High School Teachers,"As a high school teacher, I found the visuals appealing and representative of the period in which Shakespeare lived. However, I ultimately decided against showing the video in class as it states without substantiation that Shakespeare was involved in a homosexual affair with his patron, the earl of Southampton. I suppose someone has taken the style of writing Shakespeare used in his encomiums to his patron as expressions of sexual ardor rather than the sycophantic flattery which was typical in an age when artistic types were looking for deep pockets to support their career. The Bard may have been ""kissing up,"" as we would say nowadays, but it's doubtful it was in the sense the commentator used. I personally didn't feel it was worth opening that can of worms in our introductory lessons, but depending on one's purpose, others might choose otherwise."
5,Will's got it going on,"Lots of stuff about Shakespeare out there, but this contains so much information in a condensed and entertaining format. HIgh school and college level students really respond positively. Ther are discussion questions that go along with it at the A&E bio website."
1,extremely disappointed,"Bought this tape in what was described as ""good"" condition. When I went to previewed it at home it did not work, took it to school tried it on three different VCR's and it still didn't work. On the up side,I sent a note and was immediately offered a refund and was sent a return label for shipping. I can't say anything about the content, never saw it."
3,Hubris,"There were about 4 pages in the entire book, descriptions of his parents' deaths, that allowed me just the smallest insight into the man. Those 4 pages I found very valuable The rest of the book is a tribute to himself and his intellectual buddies - pure hubris. Alas, for a man who had such a majestic command of the English language, he was unable to adequately describe mundane life which is the locus of the human condition . His language soars so high that it is no longer relevant to life. He always demonstrates a high intellectual IQ but it is severely challenged by his low emotional IQ."
5,Excellent,I just got this put on my MP3 player by a friend. It is a super strong CD. Although it is 4 years old it is far from dated and is beautiful.
2,Good sleeping pill.Not real SCI-FI,I am a big Haldeman fan but this must have been written in a period of writers block.Most of the story is in first person monologe with little verbal interaction between the characters.It just skims along never putting any depth in the story or the people in it.Even when she cought her husband using there 14 year old son for his pleasure did any conversation take place.In any real life situation like that there would have been plenty of words and hellfire taking place.Probably a little mayhem also.That would have created some excitement to the story.But in the book the whole episode was passed over in a few sentances with nothing happening.If this book had been written by an unknown author it probably would have been nothing but a rejection slip.I just don't see how all these readers gave it 4 stars.It is misleeding to people who use reviews to pick books.I got it from a library.If I had bought it based on the reviews i would be really mad.
2,Leave this one at the beach house,"I have not read Joe Haldeman before and if this is an example I will definitely pass the next time someone offers me one of his books. Okay, I thought the book was science fiction. I was reading it expecting a life changing first contact novel. Instead, I got a travelogue of Americana circa 1890. The first part of the book was written like a travel journal but the only character is Rosa. We only experience what she experiences even though there are other characters in the story. We do not learn very much about them. We only see what Rosa shows us, which is usually scenery. It did not take long before I was bored out of my mind.This book was very unsatisfying. Alas, the one redeeming quality about this novel is that it is short."
5,Great book but not typical Haldeman,"It took a little bit for me to adjust to this book. After all, we like to type cast our authors and we don't expect them to change genres. Of course Haldeman has been peaking into new genres for a while (Hemmingway Hoax and Buying Time come to mind) so I've come to expect new things in each of his novels. However this is a pretty big departure for him. What is it? Well basically it's a really good turn of the century adventure/drama though Haldeman does dabble his toe into the sci-fi waters a bit at the end.In short this is a novel about a woman's journey with her son across late 1800s America as she flees an abusive husband. That physical journey mirrors here spiritual development as a person, which builds to the surprising twist at the end of the novel that makes it science fiction. So yes, it's a great book, but it is definitely not hard science fiction."
5,Aama in America,The book was just as described and was shipped quickly. The binding and pages looked great! Very happy with the purchase!!
2,you get what you pay for,"just received this item. You get what you pay for!!! The package had a large sticker on the front- NOTICE!!! this package was sent damaged please inspect immediatly. Well, you guessed it. The umbrella was sent in a plastic bag inside a damaged and re-taped box. That's it. Nothing to protect the ribs or rest of the umbrella. So I have an umbrella with a hole in the top and worn fabric that makes this item look used. First and last time I'll shop @ EWINS."
2,style over substance,"This is a pretty umbrella but the hardware that connects the 2 poles, wobbles. So it won't stand up perfectly straight. My husband took the hardware off and tried to make it more sturdy... we will see."
3,it's ok,"You get what you pay for. It works, it is a little above cheap. It lasts for about a year then one of the ribs will break, it will fade, or some cloth will tear. The way I see it is $50/year is better than paying $200 for a bit better one that will still only last 3-4 years."
3,dead sea body butter,"I recieved the product on time and packaged as usual, however the color of the product is slightly ""off"" from the others i have ordered from other supplyers. Although i have yet to open it and use it."
5,Great book,"We use this book a lot to determine where camping areas and other activities are in the state of Washington. However, it's a good idea to check that the facility or area is still open prior to travelling there, due to budgetary issues of late. Would still recommend to others."
3,Work well for smaller dogs.,"I noticed after a few weeks it's clip sticks sometimes. Maybe it'sbecause it's new, not sure. I bought this because my other dog tie out rusted at the clip."
3,"Score One, baseball and softball score keeper","Use this product at ball games that don't have a scoreboard. It works great except needs a change in the catagories it records. Needs to be able to show, innings,runs, balls and strikes and outs. We never record hits, walks, and errors!I feel this would be more usable and popular if these changes were made, and I would want to replace the one I now have."
4,Great Product,"Very well made, good quality material and workmanship. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is it is just a little bulky for what I needed."
4,Doesn't fit my flashlight,"I liked the clip on the front where you can add a pair of gloves or something like that. But the flashlight holder isn't big enough for my Surefire 5"" flashlight. Total bummer! I guess they weren't kidding when they said MINI flashlight, mine is apparently a COMPACT flashlight and therefore too big. I was using the Bucket Boss Brand 54041 Double Barrel Tool Sheath before this, and I think I'll need to Frankenstein the two together in order to get something small that'll hold everything I need."
3,It would have really killed them...,"What would have been so bad if they had made the 'stretch flashlight holder' on the side accommodate more than just the mosy tiny, narrow, mini maglite-type flashlight holding AAA batteries. For 10 cents more in construction costs, they could have constructed it with a better, more strechable material to accomodate at least a decent-width AA flashlight."
3,good quality but sticks way out when filled.,"I carry a gerber multi tool, a very small vice grip, a short philips screwdriver, a pen and some screws/ washers/ nuts/ bulbs in the pouch on a belt daily for work, i usually use the Nite Ize NPXL-03-01 Clip Pock-Its XL Utility Holster but as it eventually gave out i decided to try this one..this is a very good quality item BUT when you load all this in it it sticks way out..and when i walk my arm brushes it each time..this holster is just too narrow. i went and bought the Nite Ize NPXL-03-01 Clip Pock-Its XL Utility Holster and with same tools in it it is so much flatter."
5,Only one thing that isn't good,It would have been much better if the Flashlight Holder had been made of some sort elastic to house many styles of flashlights
2,Back tears easily,"I am a Mac technician and I use this tool clip all day on my belt. It goes on and off of my belt/pocket, but the first time I brushed up against a wall, the back started to tear on the seam which attached the clip to the pouch. Very poorly sewn together. I wanted to get another to replace it, but I assume the same thing will happen if I get another one."
1,Absolute Garbage,"This is a big waste of time and money. Stay away from this awful product. These bozos (critics?!?) even go as far as to criticize the band and Alan White claiming that everything after Close to the Edge was downhill. Excuse me- what about Going for the One, Relayer ? I think I would rather smell and chew Rumplestiltskin's dirty socks than watch this. This is an absolute travesty of grand proportions. I can't believe Yes agreed to allow this one to be released. But then again there is that other awful Live at Philadelphia. Anything to make a buck."
1,gwiz.......,"I want to thank the Yes fans who commented on this DVD,i trust their judgment, when i first heard of this DVDcoming out i was every excited thinking there would besome clips of the band in the studio or even interviewswith Eddie Offord!!!NOPE!!!WHERE ARE YOU EDDIE!!!!He helped produce the first Idle Race LP!!Hmmmmmmmmmm,come to think of where are interviews of Pete Sinfield!!!Anyway,i shall not bother with this DVD until it is on salefor,hmmmmmm,$1.00!!!!!!It is too bad there isn't more film of YES in the studio working!!I remember seeing some clips of the group working on songs from,"" Going For The One""With Steve running through, ""Awaken""!!THAT WAS SO COOL!!Where is that on DVD!!Sigh........&gwiz.....Thank you YES Fans for the heads up on this DVD!!"
5,"Fleetwood Mac ""The Dance"" - ""A Wonderful Reunion Concert DVD""!!!! ""The Perfect Cure for a ""Fleetlwood Mac Attack""!!!!!!","Great from beginning to end period!!!!A Big Amen to all the previous reviewers who gave this one a five star rating!!! This is a ""must-have"" classic concert dvd from Fleetwood Mac, espcially if you're having a ""Fleetwood Mac Attack""!!! This DVD is the perfert cure. This contains 22 songs, each one of the artists get featured in this concert. You get to enjoy all their classics. I really enjoyed Stevie Nick's & Lindsey Buckingham, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, and especially Christine McVie. Christine is very, very, talented. I didn't realize she could play keyboards so well. She ended the concert perfectly with ""Songbird"". This is a Classic and I highly recommend it!!!"
4,Christmas Gift to Son who loves Fleetwood Mac,Bought this DVD for son who has wanted it for several years. I watched portions of it with him on Christmas Day. It was a very entertaining DVD and was excellently recorded.
1,Schlock,"Riffs stolen from Clapton, Christine Mcvie, Jeremy Spencer and Peter Green,same old same old, breaking up love songs. Mick and,John Mcvie are NO Tina Weymouth and Chris Franz. Basic 3 chords, the public loves crap, but no ear for real music"
4,Awesome!,Awesome hits played throughout. Probably the last great Fleetwood Mac concert on film which includes Christie McVie. Loved it and watch it often.
2,Fleetwood mac the Dance,The concert was good. The VIDEO RECEPTION AND AUDIO IS VERY POOR!I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!I think I was given a FAKE/KNOCKED-OUT DVD from China!
3,A bit disappointed,"Although the music and performances are excellent, the sound quality left me disappointed. I originally saw this on a television broadcast and was blown away by it. I purchased the DVD and the two songs accompanied by the USC Trojans are horrendous! You can't hear the brass section. All you hear is the percussion. I was greatly disappointed because those were my two favorite performances originally BECAUSE of the Trojans. You see them dancing and playing, but the sound is left out. Boo Hoo! Buckingham's performance of Big Love is a major highlight."
2,No Dance,Video is in OLD 4X3 format but it is poor quality. Audio is poor as well. Bottom line on this purchase: REGRET
3,Start of the reunion tour ...,"There is some great music here, of course, and with new songs like ""Sweet Girl,"" ""Bleed to Love Her,"" ""and ""My Little Demon,"" along with terrific renditions of ""Big Love"" and ""Go Insane,"" Fleetwood Mac proves that it's not just a jukebox. Still, ""The Dance"" doesn't feel like a Fleetwood Mac concert; they did a much better job of capturing that atmosphere in 1982's Mirage video and the more recent ""Live in Boston.""If you own ""The Dance"" CD, though, this DVD does contain a bit more material, including renditions of ""Gypsy"" and ""Go Insane."""
2,Boring Reunion,"I think Billy Burnete and Rick Vito, along with Lindsey should have returned. What I hated about this tape was ""Stand Back"" was delayed till the tour. ""Rhiannon"" and ""Dreams"" if you can't sing it don't try. ""Everywhere"" I hated this version, Stevie and Lindsey should have sung lighter to give Christine, Sharon(stevies freind and back up singer), and Mindy sing it. ""Go INsane"" this song was tacky. ""Songbird"" showcased how much Christine had lost her voice. ""The Chain"" oh, I loved "" the Mirage Video"" version better, when Stevie and Chris was high it kicked ass. The good highlight was ""Over my head"", ""Landslide"" ""Sweet Girl"" ""Don't Stop"" and ""Silver Springs"" plus ""So Affraid""Where is ""Little Lies"", ""save me"", ""7 wonders"", ""Hold me"" and ""Sara"" + ""Sisters"""
1,The worst sounding DVD I have ever heard,"I have over 50 DVD's in my collection and I can say with no hesitation this is the worst sounding DVD I have ever heard. I feel the sound is very flat and has no detail. I compared the sound to my Fleetwood Mac Rumours CD, and the sound on the DVD doesn't even compare. If you want to see the band in concert but don't care if the sound recording is of poor quality buy the DVD. If you want to hear a high quality recording on DVD try James Taylor Live or The Eagles Hell Freezes Over on DTS. I know that I am in the minority after reading some of the other reviews here so maybe I got a poorly recorded version."
3,Something of a disappointment,"As a Fleetwood Mac nut, I found this somewhat less than overwhelming. I think I found out why on the back cover: it states, ""Filmed in front of a live audience at Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank, CA""--in onther words, not really a live, paid concert. Maybe that's why, a.) the USC Trojan Marching Band (which guest on ""Tusk"" and ""Don't Stop""), while prominent in the audio-only versions, are barely audible here, and b.) the audience, which you would think would be jumping with the music, barely looks awake throughout the show."
5,I Was Tipped Off That The Reunion Was Coming,"I saw Stevie Nicks appearing as a guest performer in early 1997 in Phoenix. It was a great show that featured as the headliner Don Henley and his friends, Bruce Hornsby, Roger McGuinn. Timothy B. Schmit. After Hornsby opened by himself and then McGuinn, They opened the curtains for the show. Late in the program, Stevie came out and sang Landslide and Rhiannon, then she announced Fleetwood Mac's reunion.I bought this DVD here, the first day it was released...I'm just feeling like writing reviews on a bitter cold, snowy Omaha evening.I knew when I saw the MTV show that I wanted to buy a DVD (and of course the CD). Does anyone really have to read a review about this BLOCKBUSTER?Yeah, I liked it, it's easy to dance to, I give it 100 Dick Clark!"
5,Exceptional Entertainment,"I have always enjoyed listening to Stevie Nicks solo and never knew much about the Fleetwood Mac days or the songs they did as a group. I bought this DVD simply because of my desire to see more Stevie Nicks. I have no idea how good the music of the Fleetwood Mac days happened to be.I enjoyed the show completely with the exception of ""Tusk"". I guess I just didn't get it. But the rest of the show was great. If a person is a Stevie Nicks fan, as I am, this would be well worth adding to a collection."
5,Required listening,This video should be required study material for every drummer and every guitar player.
1,fleetwood mac the dance,had to send it back to the U.S.A it would not work in my dvd player now waiting for money back.
2,Poor Production -- Fair Performance,"The lighting, editing, and camera work for this video is poor. Regardless, I watch live performances for the music. The sound recording was good, but I have mixed opinions about the performance. Mic was GREAT. Lindsey and Stevie were also great, but Christie was unemotional -- kinda like a non-chalet reporter. John was okay, but let's face it -- he's not much of a bass player."
1,DONT BOTHER!,"As someone who enjoyed Fleetwood Mac I decided after reading the reviews here to buy the DVD. What a waste of money! A lifeless performance with some very poor vocals in places - especially Lindsey. Some excellent guitar work doesn't make up for a lack of passion in the performance. In places its embarassing. Sorry, this is a waste of money in my opinion, there are some much better concerts to spend money on."
1,--- disappointed ---,"I bought, for the 1st time in my life, two DVD musicals ""Hell Freezes Over, Eagles"" and this one. I love FM but this DVD is soooooo disappointing, I was considering return it --- the video is dull and the audio is simply unprofessional and unforgivable !!I rate the Eagles' DVD 100 stars !!!! go get that one......."
5,Look no more: this is it!,This is the best DVD product ever made by Fleetwood Mac. Look no more: this is it.
3,Very questionable sound qaulity,The DVD visually is very good. The sound quality is terrible in my opinion. Noticed it immediately upon watching it. I love Stevie and Fleetwood Mac and have been a faithful fan for many years but I am sorry to say this DVD was not produced well.
5,Lindsey and Stevie,"I saw this DVD being played at a Bose outlet store and could not move from the performance being showed. Watching Fleetwood Mac perform ""Silver Spring"" was a real eye opener! It was as if Stevie and Lindsey were singing only to each other. Wonderful music!"
4,Charming,"One star taken away only due to the fact that I don't consider this the highest video quality, but that's being picky. Once again,if you are a Mac fan, you need this. The U.S.C. marching band alone on TUSK is worth the price of admission."
5,BEST CONCERT VIDEO I HAVE EVER SEEN,A WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF TIMELESS CLASSICS AS WELL AS SOME GREST NEW STUFF. A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONES VIDEO COLLECTION.
4,Poor sound recording but very good performance.,"This concert has a version on VHS tape. I recommend buying the VHS tape version. It seems to me that the sound recording quality is even worse on DVD than on VHS. However, you still must keep this one, either VHS or DVD. I am afraid this is probably the last concert they would perform in public. The two ladies seemed worry too much about their ages. To me, they are still as attractive and stylish as they always are. In this concert, they played almost all their greatest hits. Everybody performed very well."
5,Fleetwood Mac-The Dance,"What can we say, it's the Mac. They did a similar concert on HBO in the 80's but we could never find it on either VHS or DVD, so this later, more recent concert is the next best thing...We own may DVD concerts and play them on a big screen with great surround sound, this way we are not obstucted by ""dancing fools"" with no consideration for others....Great DVD."
5,Fleetwood Mac the Dance,One of my favorite videos. Anyone who likes Fleetwood Mac will love this video.
5,Great Concert DVD,Fantastic Reunion Concert DVD of one of the Greatest Rock bands of all time. All the songs are timeless and never grow tired of listening to them.
2,"Great Video Concert, Terrible Audio","The concert looked great and you could tell all the members were glad to be there and performing again. The only downside is you can barely hear it due to a terrible audio inlay. The sound quality on Youtube was better than on this DVD and it was Youtube that prompted me to get the whole concert. If your a fan, you will love it no matter what, but this fan is severely disappointed."
5,rich and evocative,"I was recently with Silvia at one of her workshops in a beautiful villa outside of Rome. At a late night dinner together, Invocation was playing in the background. It, like Silvia, is amazingly beautiful, and when I listen to it now, it invokes memories of a very rich evening full of great food, wonderful friends, and the soft colors of an amazing place."
3,"If you liked the first one, you'll love this one","After the explosive ending on the first book, I was hesitant to read the second one (just in case you haven't read the first one, I won't give it away--but just be warned that in the last three pages, there is a shocking ending. However, the second one has a happier ending and less of the graphic violence than the first one. The dialogue is cheesy, but that lends to the development of the main character--you get a good mental image of what he's like. One thing that I really liked about the book is that the author has a way of portraying his characters that is based on personality--he never mentions a character's nationality but allows you to visualize the person based on their characteristics and dialogue, not race."
4,Great glasses,"If you want great sturdy fiestaware glasses, these goblets are for you. To be honest, when they arrived, I wasn't too happy about the design but, once I put them with the rest of my feistaware I was very happy - they were wonderful. They are great strong glass goblets. I plan on ordering a few more boxes!"
3,Crystal Age - Far Beyond Divine Horizons,"I just received this cd a few days ago, after hearing about Crystal Age from a Metallica Tribute. From the opening yell, you just know this is going to be an intense experience.. the tracklisting is done in the form of a story. I hear that it is based on star wars (?)... Very aggressive thrash metal band, and it is worth getting.. but not for this price. Its over 25 bucks, for one cd.. I know that its only jacked up cause its an import, but still."
5,Like Etouffee - Simple but delicious,"You either like New Orleans or you don't. It's not a city that allows a lot of middle ground. You either see it as filthy, scuzzy pit of crime, or as a multi-layered, textured celebration of soul and body. If you fall into the second group, you'll like this cajun-zydeco type music from Big Al and the Heavyweights. Like some of the best New Orleans food, it's not complicated, not gourmet. Simple flavors, deep and intense, like a rich etouffee. This music has some blues, some zydeco, some cajun. Your toes will tap. You will smile. Heck, you may even dance. It's yummy and as a New Orleans aficionado, I recommend it."
4,Awesome,"I love this cd, True Vibe has just the right mix of slow and fast, with beautiful ocupela on the last song. I would definately recomend this cd to anyone who likes good music."
5,GREAT CD!,"The first time I heard the song ""Now and Forever"" on the radio, I knew that I would have to get that CD. And my money wasn't wasted!! With songs like, ""Jump Jump Jump"" and ""Never Again"" and ""Now and Forever"" - you can dance all night long!! But, dance songs are not the only thing on this CD. True Vibe also displays talent by singing ballads. Songs like ""Sweet Jesus"" and ""What Do We Wish On Now"" are so beautiful and sweet. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes 98 Degrees, 'N Sync, BSB, or the christian group, Plus One."
1,One more thing...,"One more thing...I respect these guys for making it this far and I respect them for trying, but I don't respect them for getting sucked into the system of being a singer. Don't PUT God on the priorities list. MAKE Him the priorities list. Instead of writing like BSB and N'sync why can't people come up with their own style? Be yourself. Don't be a wanna-be."
5,one of te bets groups EVER,they are one of my favoret groups. i saw them in consert two times!!!@!! i have a sighned CD and shirt. they are awsome!!
1,NO VIBE,Why would anyone listent to this crap. They are worse than the backstreet boys and nsync combined. There just another stupid boy band with crappy lyrics. Unless you like teeny bopper music i would not bother buying this CD
4,Great Customer Service,"This Holiday gift basket was erroneously shipped to me in NY, on December 20th, instead of to my Aunt and Uncle in Florida. I called Wine Country Gift Baskets and, without any questions whatsoever, they apologized and shipped the same basket overnight to my relatives.They told me to keep the one they had sent to me in error. The most I had expected from them was a Fedex shipping number that would enable me to ship the item to Florida at their expense. What I got was real customer service."
1,NOT DELIVERED WITHOUT CONTACTING ANYONE,I ordered this basket 3 weeks before christmas and it was not delivered. I began to get worried 3 days before christmas when it wasn't delivered. I checked the order and it said the basket wasn't available. Know one contacted me. I had to pay for overnight postage with another company to get a gift delivered before christmas. I won't order from this company again.
2,product NOT new as described.,"Item worked fine however it was NOT new as described... It did not include any orginal packaging or paperwork and had obviously been wired up before. This did not effect the product and it still worked fine, but should have been listed at least as an ""open box"" item..."
2,Warning,"I really like the Rosetta Stone product (although it is over priced).WARNING: Rosetta Stone (Fairfield Language Technologies) will NOT replace a CD if it is lost, stolen or damaged unless you bought the product DIRECTLY from them (and then they charge you $30 for a replacement CD). I had the misfortune of purchasing from a local bookstore and someone had stolen the disk from inside the package. In this case I can get my money back from the store I bought it from but since you can't backup the disks you had better be VERY careful to not lose one."
1,Are you kidding?,"This is by far the worse investment I ever made. This software is so overpriced for what it really is. It looks old, there is no grammar, you only get these same 4 pictures over and over again, it gets so boring after a while. I am not sure how such a software can retail for $300, even $200 I would not understand, guess they have a good marketing team!Moreover, both packages will only take you up to an Intermediate level, whereas other software can make you go up to Advanced. If you want to be fluent or learn more than several useful words and sentences, buy something else.I wanted to put 0 star for my rating but the minimum was 1!"
5,dazzled with french,"I have not had the chance to use the item as much as I would like, but have been very satisfied with what I have seen. I was a French minor in college and have participated in numerous ways to learn and maintain the language. The interactive technique and exercises appear to be far more effective than those I have experienced in the past. I am pleased with the product, overall."
4,Very good product to study French,"While not easy, this is a very good product for learning the French language. There is a variety of learning tasks that reinforces the learning experience. Although most of the learning options were useful, I found typing responses in French to be too awkward and time consuming to use without a French keyboard. The visual pictures would be more effective if images from France or the French speaking countries had been used."
2,too much hype and overpriced,"This is good for learning vocabulary, but NOT good at all for learning how to speak french. In fact, you wind up speaking poor disjointed french as a result of this. It is a good concept that unfortunately is more hype than any good.The price is rediculous considering other better products exist out there that are at lower prices (although they won't claim to have been used by NASA).To me, this is just another churned out, language product, created from a template, and to a budget. They have obviously good marketing skills, etc, but this is definately not created for the customer, ... I think the best word to describe this product is: gimick."
1,Terrible licensing policy,"Be aware, if you finish the course and attempt to sell the product to anyone else, the company will not allow it. I attempted to sell this on eBay and the company shut down the auction without notice, even though I paid full price for the software."
3,you don't need this,i bought this and after i realized i don't need it. you won't either unless you have a cd player under your radio.
2,"Medicore Print Quality, Unofficial Product","I got this poster because I liked the fact that it was different, I didn't want just another London Calling poster in my room like every other Clash fan.Maybe I should have just went with the London Calling poster... this is an unofficial product with a grainy image. It is cheap, and I suppose I got what I paid for. Just be warned this is a sub-par poster."
3,One Road ~ Ben Lummis,"I enjoy Ben Lummis's Music because he is a New Zealander, who has reached his goal, providing encouragement and motivation to other New Zealanders who have dreams to pursue."
4,Great for casual biking,These tires perform well on pavement and small amounts of mud. Excellent on gravel. Very smooth ride with little rolling resistance on smooth surfaces.
5,awesome tires,"My husband bought these for his trials bike, but I ended up wanting to try them on my full suspension. WOW! Makes a huge difference. They are awesome to use to get up and over rocks!"
2,Criticism or Biography,Ms Wilson needs to make up her mind whether to write a book of Literary Criticism or a biography. The book suffers from too much critical analysis of Sassoon's poetry and not enough about his life. Either he was an extremely boring and prosaic poet or Ms. Wilson needs to delve deeper into his intellectual and emotional development - really his cricket exploits and his hunting prowess does not lend anything to the very essence of his life. Ms. Wilson's prose is turgid and repetitive. An extremely disappointing work.
4,"If you're not into retro gaming, stay away.","Gameplay. What's needed most in the game industry. Mega Man is here to show you exactly why he's had more sequels than any 3-D game out there.As the title states, if you're not into retro gaming, stay away. This gives you the way Mega Man was in the 8, 16 and 32-bit days.Capcom remains faithful to the blue bomber by giving the fan everything. From art work to clips of the old TV show, fans won't be dissapointed.If only more game developers would care more about how a game would play rather than the graphics... ah. One day."
4,controller is key,"Megaman's cool no doubt,, but the controls on this pale in comparison to the nes. Everytime i play this i wish i was holding an nes controller. I just played Megaman 6 on nintendo and it was awesome. If i wasn't so cheap i would have bought all the original versions...actually after these controls i just might. Great collection of games though...i just wish the nes ones were as cheap."
4,solid game,classic megaman. Tough but rewarding. I think the overall presentation could have used more work but this is certainly more preferable than trying to go out and find the games on nes or snes.
4,Ok... But missing somthing,Me being one of the biggest mega man fans (from Megaman 1 to Red sun and blue moon) was very happy to get this. After reading abot reversed controls on the gamecube version I baught this one instead. I love all the games and laugh at some of the bad graphics back then. The one thing missing is the X games! Those were my favorits ( X1 and X3 especially) Buy this one. It's woth thje money. But beware of the Gamecube version
2,Who was in charge of play testing this game???,"I bought the game even though I have an original NES & SNES with all of the games included on this disc & the Power Battles on MAME. I wanted to have smoother-looking graphics and non-mono music & sound effects (as is the case in the original MM 1-6 games). When I began to play, I thought I was having an off day. All of my jumps were a split second off; Mega Man moved a bit sloppy and reacted slowly. Alas, whoever play tested this game did not play the original versions which had lightning fast reaction and precision control as this version does not have the superior control of the originals. Perhaps the pressure sensitive controls that maqus1213 referred to are the culprit. Anyone who hasn't played the originals probably won't notice the control flaws, but to those who have, most will notice the imprecision right away."
2,Mega Man,"I nearly freaked when I saw this game available. It brought back lots of memories from the NES and Jr High School. However, I do not recall Mega Man being SO DAMN HARD!!!! It looked exactly like I remembered it, and was just awesome to see it all again, and be able to play it, but I found it to be one of the most difficult games I've ever encountered. Maybe all the years of Playstation, N64, Gamecube, etc. has just made something so simple something very very hard. I wanted to love the game, and part of me did, I'm just glad I rented it and didn't buy it. Too DAMN HARD."
1,what a piece of junk,"I have played many Mega Man games and they all sounds and looks the same. It's funny how Capcom can get away with this piece of junk. I will not buy this worthless collection. I hated 1,2,3 and X2,3,4,5 is like the same game but with bad graphics and stupid game play. Avoid at all costs if you wanna spare your money."
1,This stuff sucks,"Worst hare job EVR! bot it with the last nine dollars i got saved and was fuxin PISSED when i discovered,,...... it DOESN'T WORK :(((((((((((((((((((((what happened took place on the evening of January 20th around eight pm in the evening. my friend decided to pour this all OVER my face and hare, it got everywhere needless to say,that, mixed eith some toner mixed in, she had successfully BOTCHED my beautiful locks!!!!!!btw-this product doesn't actually work at all, only fried/damaged my hair, didn't tone it to the desired ""frostyness"":((( SAD DAY"
5,copmiler for C,"If you want to see how a compiler is written for the C programminglanguage, this is the book for you. this book shows how to construct a C compiler for a subset of the C language. The book lists all the source codes"
2,"love the light, hate the joint","I bought one of these great looking 5 light torchieres for my teenage daughter's room. We just love the thing, but it did not have a good fit at the middle of the tall tube. The threads were rough and hardly enough to hold the weight of this otherwise well made and heavy light. We returned the lamp to the store and replaced it with another. Same thing. When you move this unit, do so very carefully, since it breaks in the middle. I still use it, but it is delicate. Poor design in one spot."
1,This lamp doesn't stand!,"Give this lamp a few months, and the threads will wear away and it will fall over.It's a great idea, but it doesn't have the support.I don't live in a ""zoo"" I just happen to move around the lamp once every few weeks and that's just too rough for this lamp.Unless you plan on keeping this lamp behind glass, don't waste your money on it like I did."
4,"Good in a home, Not in a zoo.","We have this lamp and love it, it's stylish, but really lights up an entire living space unlike other lamps that seem to only light up their little corner of the room. The lamp heads are all adjustable and can be positioned to light up every corner of a room. The only problem as others have suggested is the stand is relatively flimsy where it attaches. It's not sturdy, or thick, and so it's easily broken. Our 2 yr old thought it would be fun to stand on the base and lean back holding the pole, so it snapped. We quickly went out and purchased an identical lamp placing it behind a heavy piece of furnitre so it wouldn't be messed with and it's lasted and worked wonderfully.I'd recommend purchasing the lamp, but make sure when you're handling or moving it that you be gentle, and don't keep it in an open space with young kids."
2,The thing wont Screw together!,"I purchased this lamp, and i am having the same problem as some of the other reviewers. My bottom and middle base wont screw in and the bad thing is i cant take mine back cause the receipt is over 90 days old. I wish it was something that could be done, but i really liked the lamp, i guess i might try the black one."
5,Torchiere with 5 Gooseneck Arms - Steel,"I am a female senior citizen, or recycled teenager, who lives alone. This product was very easy to assemble. It works perfectly and I am very satisfied with my purchase."
1,Not a Good Value for any Cost,"We purchased our lamps and moved one from one side of the room to another less than 3 months of purchase. The stand came loose from stripped thread where it screws in. We propped the lamp in a corner. Next problem - using correct bulbs, the Shades started turning yellow and on a few melted places on shades. Not a Good Value at any Price."
3,Poor quality stand,"The threads, where you screw the lamp stand together, either broke or were too short to hold the weight of the lamp. I have to use a bicycle cord to keep the lamp from falling over.<br /><br />I had the same problem with another similar lamp (same brand). I returned that one, and the replacement has been fine.<br /><br />It's too bad, too. We like the ""look"" of the lamp, and funtionality. But, the stand is cheaply made...at least, the one we have.<br /><br />I expected ""better"" from Target!"
2,disappointment,"As other reviewers have voiced, this lamp is great until it breaks, and it's only a matter of time until it does. I came home one day to find the joint stripped, so now the top half leans slightly. Great idea, poor construction."
3,base broke very easily,"My daughter loved this lamp, WHILE IT LASTED !!!We put it together in her dorm room and all the arms on the lamp were great in distributing light. At the end of the year we unscrewed the base and packed it to go home. When we tried to reassemble it at home THE BASE WOULD NOT CONNECT. So if you never plan to move, it will work for you."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I purchased this lamp from the store today, and I will be returning it on tomorrow. I should've known something was wrong (with the price being low), but every now and then you find a great bargain, and I figured this was just one of them. However, I couldn't even get the thing assembled properly. One of the other reviewers described precisely the problem I had when screwing in the bottom part of the pole to the base. I've putten together many floor lamps in the past, and this one is just poorly constructed. I was finally able to rig it up good enough for me to see how it would look in the room, and everyone is right... it looks great. But now that I've read the reviews, rather than exchanging it for a new one, I'll be shopping for a different product."
2,"Great Idea, yet poorly carried out!","I gave this two stars only because I think it's a great style of lamp, and great idea, however it is really a poorly made lamp. The metal is weak and the threads stripped easily, and the base falls off all the time...I've had mine for less then two years, and only after about 3 months of having it it became a dust collector in the closet! It wont stand up anymore at all and I keep wondering if it's fixable, but am ready to toss it because it's not worth it! So my advice...is dont spend the money on this style of lamp, go for something more balanced. I am very dissapointed :(<br /><br />"
3,Poor quality stand,"The threads, where you screw the lamp stand together, either broke or were too short to hold the weight of the lamp.

1,Do Not Buy,"This lamp was fine for the first 6 months. The lighting is perfect if you can keep the thing standing up straight. After about 6 months it started leaning to one side. We checked the base and noticed it wasn't screwing into the base properly anymore and when you tried to straighten it, it would just come completely out of the base. Poor threading. Needs to have a higher threading on all poles and complete threading on all poles. So, if you would like for your lamp to last more than 6 months, DO NOT BUY THIS LAMP!"
1,Don't buy this lamp.,I admit the lamp was beautiful when I first bought it but it seems that right around the 90 day period you have to return something it fell apart. The bottom part that screws together no longer screws and it leans. It is an embarassment to have in my living room with my contemporary decor and now I have to spend another $30-$50 for a new lamp. The reviews that are listed are very true and this product is not worth the money.
1,Construction very poor.,"Construction very poor.If you can keep it standing, it looks very nice... The treading on the stand is of very poor quality... As a matter of fact it is non-existent on some of the pole sections.The short story is we gave this as a gift. Therefore it got opened past the 90 day warranty, and Target will NOT take care of this situation... Bad all around..."
1,"Only great looking, not great WORKING..","This lamp may look good, but for me, it wasn't a great buy at all.. The base &amp;amp; stand are cheaply built, making the arms too heavy for the base, never standing straight up without falling over..The lamp worked good for about 2 weeks. Any time i tried moving the arms or the lamp itself, the base would come apart &amp;amp; fall to the ground.. I had to replace the inner parts a few times &amp;amp; that still did not help.I had the lamp for 2 weeks; it was thrown away a few days later.."
1,breaks within three days,"This item catches the eye quickly, and the price locks you there. Lo and behold, within days your beautiful lamp is broken. It was made very clumsy and the base broke quickly."

1,I am on my second broken lamp,"I have bought two of these modern looking lamps, yet both have broken after as little as 2 weeks. I did not even use them for light, simply decoration. The problem is the top heavy design and the lack of support in the middle. If you don't mind buying a new one every couple of weeks the lamp looks great for the time its standing straight."
4,Good lamps are hard to find,"I have two friends who bought this lamp, so I was able to try it out before I purchased it. I was so liked it, I would have easily paid fifty or sixty dollars for it. So, I go to target and low and behold, I see the lamp! Of course I immediatly bought it, but when I got home I realized the parts wouldn't screw together correctly. I go to the store to return it and upon arriving I see that their display model has the same problem. So not wanting to take any chances I assemble the new one at the store. Turned out it worked fine :-). I absoulutly love it! I use those round decorative bulbs you see around mirrors in fancy bathrooms. It looks great! I wouldn't recommend buying it online though, since returning it might be difficult."
1,Weak link,"Great looking lamp. The problem is the middle connection. The threads are so loose that it almost, but doesn't quite catch. After examining it, it's clear someone used the tape contractors use to be sure threads are sealed for plumbing. Which can be a fine solution but is not adequate in this case. From reading other reviews, it appears that the problem is, perhaps, random. Not good enough for me; will be returning the lamp."
1,Lamp did not work,"How do I return this item? It is a Target item I purchased online with Amazon.com. We put in bulbs and as long as there was only one in it worked, but more then it did not. A real disappointment since this was a surprise for my daughter's room so she could see to read and study better. Now, we are stuck with this non-working fixture."
4,"Fun, but takes a while","We have had fun making ice cream, but it takes about 30 minutes of rolling the ball around before you are done. After 15 minutes you have to stop, open the ball and scrap the frozen parts from the sides (not as easy as you think!). In the end, the ice cream was good and we had fun!. The best part is you can use ingredients that you typically have on hand."
4,one of the illest teen rappers of the 90's,"this album right here is solid, and you would think for a kid his age this album would be equipped with puffy style beats,nope,hot street rugged beats,and this kid is lyrical,don't sleep,but its too bad he didn't get the buzz he deserved,my favorite tracks are gusto (produced by Miladon,don't know who he is but did a good job,you would think that havoc made this beat,featuring prodigy),and alpha 2 omega (hot beat).recommended for fans of east coast hip hop and 90's hip hop."

3,Vlad the Bland,"I bought this DVD to show to my high school students, who are reading Bram Stoker's Dracula. After looking at various websites on Vlad Tepes, they were really anxious to learn more about the real Dracula. One of their biggest complaints was how much time in the video's beginning was devoted to Dracula's castle, which actually was never Vlad's castle at all. The rest is interesting, but is told in a very dry manner. I understand it's a documentary, but it needed a better presentation. There were some interesting facts, such as many of the atrocities attributed to Vlad the Impaler were actually committed by his father, Vlad the Evil. If you want to get some background, I'd recommend the video. It just won't be as titillating as some of the websites out there on Vlad."
4,Use it all the time!,"This golf log is helpful if you play a lot of golf. I get out 2-4 times a week and am always looking to improve my game. This log is easy to follow and carry around, so it's perfect. Even when I forget to bring it, I am writing notes on my score card for it.Overall a good purchase for those golfers looking for a simple way to track progress."
2,I was hoping for a bit more,"I became interested in this item after seeing a few other log books. Unfotunately I didn't get to see the internal layout of the pages themselves. As a still ""new"" golfer, I wanted a bit more information on what my shots did (well what I did) than this book allows for recording. Though it's small enough to fit into a back pocket, it's pretty big in comparison to other books I've used as well."
1,Very Disappointed,"I buy children watch for myself because I have a tiny wrist. This watch itself looks quite cute, but the belt is made in very cheap, elastic, fabric material. First, you can not get it wet when you wash your face. Second, it uses just a simple button to close the belt.Whenever I took off a heavier coat than a sweatshirt, the watch came off my wrist. Eventually, even the watch came off the belt, and there is no way to nail it back. It's totally waste of money."
4,An overall short summary of Germany's WWI leader.,"As the authors point out, it was not the Chancellor or William II that ran Germany late in World War I, but Hinderburg and Ludendorf. These men were responsible for the gamble that payed off in huge losses to the German Army and moral problems both at the front and at home. These guys called the shots, and when Germany could no longer go on, they blamed it on the minorities back home (Jews, Communists, profiteers). Hinderburg was the author of the stab in the back theory. Rather than admit that it was their policies that lost the war, they blamed it on someone else.Hinderburg was later responsible for bringing Hitler to power and he should be blamed for losses in both wars. The authors show Hinderburg in a negative light with all he did.This is a nice short read on a bad military leader. At a little over a hundred pages, it shows Hinderburg's rise and the faults that resulted in millions of deaths."
3,A tough slog,"I really wanted to love this book, because I like a lot of the art she writes about. But the prose is awful!! And it's actually not that Jones is ""too"" theoretical -- if anything, she might not be ""theoretical"" enough. Instead, she constantly uses current crit theory buzzwords -- ""performative,"" ""embodied,"" ""subject"" etc -- without ever really defining or locating them. And the readings of individual art works get buried under her heavy-handed ""thesis.""This is one of those academic texts that feels like it started with an ""idea,"" and found work to fit it. Not that her engagements with Hannah Wilke, Bob Flanagan, et al, aren't sincere, because they are. But they still seem without real awareness, and some of the author's ""personal"" observations are just dopey.Somehow she seems new to the territory and wierdly conventional."
1,"One of the most pretentious, arrogant books I have ever read","Other reviewers here have already noted how graceless, jargon-laden, and bloated Jones's prose is. I would just like to add that her tone of lofty superiority to the non-specialist audience for art and -- worse, much worse -- to many of the ""masculinist"" [sic] artists she writes about is maddening. I couldn't help thinking, as I read her disdainful analyses of Pollock in particular, and became increasingly disgusted by the scorn she heaps on those dumb middle-American clucks who insist on seeing him as heroic, that unlike Jones, who has had one cushy academic post after another, Pollock, if I can be forgiven an old-fashioned cliche (the only kind Jones favors is of the academic variety), actually starved for his art. Reading Jones could almost turn one into a cultural conservative..."
5,An essential text on body art practices from the 60s - 90s!,"Amelia Jones writes with intelligence and outstanding flair on a subject that is by no means unproblematic. Her text focuses on body art practices (NOT to be confused with the blanket term ""performance art"") and how they reflect both artistic and social aspects of (specifically American) culture from the 1960s to today. Jones offers theory-based analysis of such artists as Vito Acconci and Hannah Wilke, and gives extensive notes. Although her viewpoint is that of a feminist, the reader should by no means view Jones' work as ""essentialist""; she cites many sources and deals with complicated art-historical issues very ably. Simply a must-read for students of art, art history, feminist theory, women's studies, etc., etc.!"
4,It is what I expected,This is simply a choke cable. It is well constructed and operates smoothly. It was also shipped promptly after the order was placed.
2,How do I get the CD replaced?,"I bought Winds of Worship as a gift...it is a fantastic CD! However, the CD quit working, so we tried using other CD players & it didn't work on any CD player. The CD players work because we tried other CDs, which do play). So how do I go about getting a replacement CD? Seems like there should be some warranty. Thanks!"
1,Good guys fight bad guys with help of magic sword.,"Batman (Ramirez) and Robin (Quentin McLeod) continue in their quest to rid the earth of the baddies. The evil Kortan continues to try to eliminate Quentin because a prophecy states that the Highlander will destroy him and his empire (as in Luke Skywalker).[I see they follow the 'K' name practise for the arch villain.] There are a few Scots included, but no immortality story lines"
4,PacTool SA902 siding gauge set,"I purchased this tool to use on Hardi HZ5 fiber cement siding. I use the PAC Tool SA902 gauge set in conjunction with a set of Solo Sider siding gauges. The PAC Tool gauges are easier to remove and work well when the reveal is consistent from bottom to top. The Solo Sider works extremely well when the reveal has to be adjusted or when the reveal is inconsistent, together they have proven worth the cost."
5,Better than the Others,I've used the other ones the break away ones (junk) the Malco ones arn't that good these on the othe hand work great for Hardie (fiber cement) and Smart Lap ( LP OSB) would not use any other siding gauge than this one!
4,Great tool.,The pactool gauges are very easy to use and worked great. They are well built and were a huge time saver.
1,gecko gauge sa902,does not have setting for 4 inch courses..not to be used on pre painted hardie lap siding..
2,Good but worth the money?,"It works good but I am not sure it was worth the money but it is better than having someone else, that is for sure."
5,Great,"These are definitely worth the bucks. They work like a second set of hands. No helper needed, geat cost saver, very sturdy, pro quality.."
2,Doesn't work with Beaded Siding,Do not buy this if you have beaded siding. It will not work properly. If you do not have beaded siding then I recommend it.
5,Outstanding!!!!!,"These gauges are wealth worth the money. They cut the work time down even greater than what the reviews said they would. After approx an hour or two the effiecency became so good that the person cutting material could not keep up and was even hard pressed to keep enough material available for one man, when installing full 12 foot planks.The installation was for 5 inch exposure and they ran very true on each course and very level.Really don't know why we waited so long for them."
4,Devil Thumbs a Ride,"This band is always great. Although this album only has one hit (Vanishing Cream), the other tracks aren't disapointing despite the decline of industrial music during this era.The CD was delived in an average amount of time, and in great condition. I was satisfied with the overall result of my purchase."
4,LOL,"Holden Masters is a quarterback who was injured in an auto accident. Taylor Angelis a physical therapist hired to help Holden recover from his injuries that could cost him his career. Holden's agent ""hides"" him out on the Jersey shore while negotiations on Holden's new contract are underway.Holden had invited this flaky sister and his surfer dude half brother to spend the summer with him at his home in the country - they instead join him in Jersey. Add Holden's persistent ex-girlfriend to thix mix and you get five - and a crowd.This story is funny and frothy and a very entertaining read."
2,Disappointed,"I give this DVD-R a 2 star rating. This is not a true video production, but rather zoom and pans of about 100 photographs. The collection of photos is impressive, the subject matter is interesting and beautiful, and I liked the concept of viewing the park in different seasons. But photographs have only a single plane of focus and zooming in on areas off center to see blurry detail is uncomfortable to watch. Photographs also do not do justice to waterfalls, raging rivers, and wildlife. There is no natural soundtrack. The music is not as annoying as is common in this genre, and but I preferred to mute it. There is a narrated soundtrack that I did not listen to for more than a few seconds, and but it seemed informative.I should have researched Telly Awards on Wikipedia before buying this DVD-R, as it is not impressive that the winners have to pay for their own award statues."
5,Rosetta Stone= GREAT,"I just wanted to learn japanese not only because my school did not offer it but also because of my interest in the Second World War and the fact that Japanese culture can be found everywhere. I've used other methods, but Rosetta Stone is the best way to learn due to its easy to follow lessons and methods of teaching the user. Instead of making you translate from one language to another, you learn that language by itself so you can think in it and not have to translate back. It exploits the uses of microphone technology to test your speaking skills while using the traditional method of reading. I am now on my way to speaking Japanese fluently and I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to learn Japanese."
1,Prophetic Message Lacks Deep Insight,"Though the title of the book and the book's cover invited my curiosity, I found the contents lacking in deep prophetic message. It probably would have been considered more prophetic if Christian believers had not already been exposed to prophetic messages given by best selling author Hal Lindsey. Through brief discourses of the book, the writer takes the opportunity to market his other writings as if to impose or insist the reader buy them for more insigt -- it left a bad taste in my mouth and produced doubt and speculation on the credibility of the authors true prophetic insight."
5,Insert CD and Drive................,"Having attended the CD Release Party for Pandemic at the Wreck Room in NY on Saturday night I can honestly say that this is whats next. ""Three Hundred Thousand Volts of Electricity"", the opening soundbite of the CD and the show is an understatement. The heavy baseline of Sheehan, the Crunch and Drive of Deitz, and the pounding of Torres, sets you up for a vocal range and acuity of Kopp which is unmatched. The production quality of the CD is equally impressive, great job N.S. Buck Brundage, and the full range of mix and mastering by Phill Magnotti make this a truly professional release worth the price. Personal favorites are ""Well of Souls"" and the opening track ""Out of Time""but the whole CD is so varried in style but complete in the individual ""Pandemic"" sound everyone will find something to enjoy. (Except maybe boy-band fans, but they can covert)Insert CD and Drive............."
3,Not so good,"This conductor was one of the most refined and he has made some great recordings. However, Rossini does not need refinement. The performances are too slick and not very exciting. Toscanini is the best with Rossini, with Beecham coming in a close second.By the way, you can get the identical recording at Best Buy in the series of reissues made just for the store. It will cost about $6.00. But, if I were you, I would try Toscanini for a few bucks more, even though the recording is a little bit older"
5,this toy looks good,this looks like a good model kit. i have not seen it anywhere yet. so it looks good
4,Fantastic Resource,"I study Herbal Medicine via correspondance & this is one of my text books. It is the most complete reference to Herbalism I have come across to date yet still worded in a way that the average person can understand & relate to. I wouldn't suggest the Herbal section for too much in depth research as he does leave a lot of herbs out, but the herbal info he has included is beyond comparison. This is definately a fantastic resource & general reading book for all those interested in making the world a better place, not only is it a great reference guide, Hoffman's spiritual views are something to make the average Baby Boomer ashamed. I recommend this for anyone with an open & honest mind."
5,Very happy with this product.,"On a suggestion from my doctor, I pruchased my first pair of Truform hose about 15 years ago. I've tried wearing the Jobst hose, but they don't offer the same compression scale as Truform. The Truform hose are dependable products and they last for a good amount of time. In all the years that I've been wearing this particular brand, I have only gotten a run/whole/snag in two socks. Definately a good product for everyday wear."
4,A good introduction to Ravi Shankar and to music of India,"Other CDs go much deeper into the richness of Ravi Shankar's sitar music and his interpretation of the music of India. However, those new to this music will probably find this the easiest introduction. It does have some of his ragas.Listen also carefully to the rather playful ""West Eats Meat"", as well as ""Tana Maria"", ""Friar Park"", and ""Prashanti"".The venerable musician's music will appeal, not only to those already familiar with sitar and Indian music, but to those with a liking for jazz and classical music...actually to anybody who enjoys music at all."
4,Excellent introduction to a world class artist,"I do not claim to be an expert or even knowledgeable regarding Indian music but I really enjoy listening to this and it will certainly lead me to explore more of Ravi Shankar's recordings and other Indian artists. So if you are ,like me , curious and looking for an entre into this music I would certainly recommend this CD."
5,Play.Survive.Win-Who Did it??,"Devi Taylor is a famous actress who unwittingly gets sucked into the role she is playing. She has the role of Melanie Prescott whose story started the series about Play.Survive.Win.Devi and her ex who plays Melanie's protecter in the movie (and husband) end up getting set up in their own version of Play.survive.Win and try to beat the clock figuring out different clues along with Andrew Garrison (a person who is introduced in the second installment, who was sucked into the game before) as their protector.As Devi and her ex get to the end of the game things start clicking into place as they find out who actually is involved in bringing Play.survive.Win into the real world.Great conclusion to an awsome series-and keeps you guessing till the end."
2,Not the best out of the three,"I feel that the author wasn't being creative in this installment in the series. In the second book, the main female character was an actress. In this book, the samle thing, the main female character is an actress. In the second book, the main male character's name was Devlin. In this book, the main female character's name was is Devi. Way too similar. I think the author more or less ran out of steam here. I did like the ending, but it took me a long while to get to it as unlike the previous two books, I couldn't read this one all in one setting and had to keep putting it down."
5,This is killing me...,"I'm at work, down to the last fifty pages of Prada Paradox and I'm AT WORK. I NEED to finish this book, it's getting better and better with every miniscule chapter. (I sneak-read a few pages. No, no, put it away. This is work for God's sake. They don't pay me to read. Well, maybe just a couple more pages...this is killing me to see it sitting there waiting for me) Julie Kenner introduces a new main character here, Devi. Same basic plan...PSW is after her, no surprise there. The tension builds dramatically throughout the book. Similar storyline but different enough plot to make it fresh and exciting. It does take longer for the actual PSW game to get going, but you're not left bored by any means. I'm just surprised it's almost over. Last installment, it seemed the chase lasted forever.I only hope she's got another installment in the wings. Great read, short (331 + epilogue), but great."
4,Much Better Than The Last,"I was a bit put off by the last book in this series. It was too similar to the first, and just not interesting enough to keep me entertained. But, the final book in this series was wonderful. The characters and story line follow what you have read before - and yet there are answers in this book (yes, you find out who did it). This story follows an actress (Devi) who is playing the original character (Mel from book 1) in a movie about Play, Survive, Win (PSW). Devi gets sucked into the game - as do all the leading ladies in this series - and she has to fight to keep herself alive.What was fun with this book was the introduction of a whole group of new players, the movie scene in Hollywood, and the fact that you can actually start to put together whomever is behind this whole thing. I wouldn't pick this book up without first reading book one. But, it is very fun and will keep you hoping that our leading lady makes it out with her life!"
5,I liked this,"3rd in the series. I liked it better than the 2nd I think. It was quick and entertaining, which I am all about these days. I could do without schlep in the book though. For some reason, it irks me. Still, a good book. I like how it tied into the 1st."
2,Superficial and Overpriced,"An easy read and I fully agree with the premise. But I found the content lacking depth, and the price of this small paper excessive."
4,Yay Bowden,Great book. Used it for an argumentative essay I had to do on Columbus. Was one of the few books I could find that defended Columbus. He uses objectivity to determine his thesis.
2,Weak tuner,"The menu is rather odd and takes a bit of reading, but the killer for me is that the unit can only pull in 7 stations, while my cheapie Zenith pulls in over 40! For the stations it did pull in, the video was surprisingly good and the digital audio is quite nice too.**Update: gave the box to a friend to play with and it works well at his place. So I'd have to rate it 4 stars, depending on the antenna."
2,Disappointed,"I have never written a review, but this time I feel compelled. I purchased this book because I have an interest in nutrition and raw foods for myself and my companion animals. I eagerly awaited this book after having read ""Natural Nutrition for dogs and cats"" the authors more successful writing. This one I was ready to ship back, except with postage I would have lost most of what I paid. Save your money and put it towards a good raw foods book for humans. If you remember to hold the chocolate, onions, raisins and grapes, you can give your pets what you eat providing your diet is a good one. The recipes aren't anything new. There are some nice photos of people and thier pets though. SAVE YOUR MONEY or check the site, I'll be selling mine."
1,This book is absolutely horrible!,"This books is supposedly about the next American century (if there will be one, that is), but the only thing the author talks about is about how stupid of a school Harvard is! He keeps on coming back to Harvard over and over again as if it were the main theme of the book. I bought this book thinking I would learn something about american politics and how they relate to the rest of the world. Boy was I in for a surprise! The author makes fun of americans and their politics in the entire book. I don't mind that too much to be honest, being French, however, I was expecting somewhat of a scholarly treatement of the subject. This is not what I got! Please, don't waste your money on that book!"
4,"This is an interesting approach; not entirely successful, but interesting nonetheless.","If you're the type of listener who thinks that no one can improve on Enya's original recordings, then you're bound to be disappointed by this set. If, however, you're curious about how someone else could reinterpret her characteristic sound, this disc may be a pleasant surprise. Several of Enya's tracks benefit from the application of the orchestra, most notably ""The Celts."" But while the orchestra is a nice touch, Sayre and co. tend to demonstrate a tin ear when it comes to adapting Enya's delicate wash of sounds to a larger scale.Note: There is a second recording of Enya's work by the Taliesin Orchestra, but this one is much better. The second disc features rerecordings of the vocal tracks with a less-compelling singer and should be avoided."
2,Hush Puppies Softstyle,"In terms of looks, these shoes is a 4 out of 5...simple, classic, and elegant. However - if you walk around in these shoes for more than couple hours, it becomes very uncomfortable. The inner lining is a bit rough at the back too, so it's blister prone. I would still go with Naturalizer - much safer option."
1,Not-so-Indestructible,"I have a small Boston Terrier (14 lbs), that loves to destroy everything. This toy was a ""8"" on the tough level. Within 5 minutes, he tore the small loop off the top. Then soon after, began tearing apart the black on the edges, soon revealing the inside of the toy. Glad I did not buy the toy in a local store for $12 dollars. Is there any toy that a dog won't destroy within 5 mintues of receiving it? Would love any suggestions!"
4,"great ""anywhere"" stroller","I've had this stroller for 2 months now--It is a great cross between a cheapo umbrella stroller and the enormous stroller. It's compact and light. It is well padded for my daughter, and has much more support for her back (she is not slouched into it like the umbrella stroller) and has little side pockets for storage. The handles are padded and very ergonomic, it has a nice ride on flat surfaces, but as for off-roading it is a little rough. The canopy is useless, so bring a sunhat!Overall, it is a great stroller, and I am very pleased with it!"
2,Probably not worth it,"When looking for an umbrella stroller, I checked this one out after having read the reviews. People commented on the narrowness of the stroller. This is a very narrow stroller. I took my 3 month old with me, and while she is a big baby, she was still up against the sides of the stroller. As she gets bigger this will get more cramped and I can't see being able to use this past one year old if that.It also does not have a 5 point harness and for safety reasons I like having the shoulder straps even though she doesn't sit up right now.If you have a small baby and are looking at travel use stroller, it's probably not bad, but don't expect to use it up to the weight limit. I ended up with the Chicco which, while not perfect, is wider and should be usable until she's a toddler.I definitely recommend taking your baby for a test ride in any stroller you are looking to purchase."
5,Defeat Pain,"KRS truly guides you lovingly through pain and assists your body's responsiveness through her soothing, calming meditative journeys. This cd is a MUST for anyone in stress or pain. KRS helps your body free itself and helps you manage stress and pain in more positive, effective ways. Thank you KRS!!"
1,Worthless! Save your $$$,"This pan is lightweight, thin and bows up in the middle. I have tried using it a number of times and it is totally useless. Does not deserve to be labeled ""Anolon""! I rated it 1 star because there is no option for no stars."
2,"loved in beginning, not now!","I have about 5 pans of this model, different sizes. They work just fine in the beginning but after they are used for awhile the non stick properties just disappear and they are all just another pan. I have followed their directions, no oil, no spray, plastic spatulas. Didn't make a difference.At least they are heavy pans but now have to use the oil a lot to keep the meat or whatever from sticking to the bottom.Ohio"
4,Anolon 5 Quart 11-Inch Sauteuse with Glass Lid,"This pan is an excellent size for large meals. Very convenient to use with the helper handles and nonstick interior. Cooks evenly and fast.Two negatives---1. NOT dishwasher safe. This is mentioned several times in the warranty information. And 2. Moisture collects inside the lid during cooking and drips down the sides and onto the stovetop--- unless great care is taken to watch and lift the lid often. A messy, annoying problem which could be solved with a venthole in the lid."
5,Anolon 5 Quart 11-Inch Sauteuse with Glass Lid,"I really thought that I would never use this item. ""A shallow pot - what in the world would I ever use this for?"" Turns out, it is great for just about anything. The wide shallow bottom helps cook a great deal of food quickly for a ""starving"" teenagers - ""Mom!, I'm hungry NOW!""Anolon is great. Heats up quickly, cooks evenly, and clean up is a swipe of a sponge. FYI - Glass lid is a great idea, but in practice it fogs up - like all glass between two different temperatures."
4,Great Value!,"I cook with this pan three or four times a week. It heats evenly, with no discernible cool spots, unlike Calphalon, and it has a nice hefty feel. If the coating does eventually wear off, I'll just buy another. I figure I can buy ten of these on sale for the price of a single comparable pan from Allclad, so it's really a no-brainer."
2,Returned-too lightweight,"I returned this product since it was too light ""weight."" I have a whole set of Anolon pans that I really love. Apparently my other pans are ""ANOLON ADVANCED"" not just ""ANOLON."" I love my ANOLON ADVANCED pans, but this ANOLON pan did not measure up to the quality of the ADVANCED series."
3,Great until the nonstick surface wears -- about 18 months,"I've used this pan almost daily for the past 18 months. Love it for its size, even cooking and ease of cleanup. The past couple months I noticed that things began burning. Probably have to get a new one. Haven't decided between this and the Calphalon. If this were still under $20, I'd get two -- one to use and one to store until I needed another one.At $87.00, I'm not sure I'd get another Analon brand."
4,Anoon 5qt 11inch Sauteuse,"What agreat buy... WIll not buy another brand of pots or pan, love this brand. Easy to cook and clean."
2,not the same pan,"I bought one of these pans as shown with the bulbus handels and loved it,decided to get one for my sister,and it came as a much more inferior product,the bottom bowed up and would not come flat again,would not recomend this latest offering."
1,Product is different from the pictures,"I bought this one recently. When I received it, I found it looked different from the picture. The three handles are different from the pictures, which is without beautifully styled curve shape as shown in the pictures and description of the product. In addition the real thin handles is very hot and hard to touch when I cook something. I was so disappointed since I like the beautiful shape of the handles in the pictures very much."
5,Anolon 5-Quart 11-Inch Sauteuse,"My wife is a formally trained Chinese chef. She frequently uses the first one of these we bought. We've had it for about 2 1/2 years and it has held up to all that use quite well. I recently bought her a second one after finding it on Amazon at a greatly reduced price. It is still in the box, held in reserve for the day when she needs it. The price was great, and the delivery prompt."
4,Great shape but handles are HOT!,"I am not much of a cook, but was getting tired of my ""discount store"" skillets and wanted to upgrade without breaking the bank. I wanted a ""skillet"" large enough to brown a nice portion of meat and allow plenty of room to add stir fry vegetables, sauces, etc., without overfilling the pan. I also wanted a lid that actually FIT the skillet. (A luxury for me!) I love the shape of this ""sauteuse"" (whatever that is) pan. It browns meat very nicely. It holds PLENTY of food, so no more worrying about overspills. One oversight of mine in researching this pan was that it is quite a bit larger than my biggest stove eye. My most surprising ""uh-oh,"" however, came when I found out the metal lid and pan handles are NOT heat resistant. Ouch! Felt pretty stupid, and that will be the biggest drawback to me. Overall, I feel this will be a great pan, and as a 4 for 3 purchase, the price was certainly right. Love the free shipping, no sales tax, and fast delivery."
3,not worthy the money,"Before I bought this, I SEARCHED and read other people's review and I remember some one said this item is much better than Aphalon, and personally I don't agree at all. I found this item too big for most electricity oven and it is not easy to heat it even (the edge part will be still cool when the center is extremely hot)...it cost around $30 for this item and I don't think it is worthy..."
4,Atom Bombs,"Great Book!The creation of the Atomic Bombs was a ""Defining Event"" in the History of Man--even if we have not been able in 50 years to face that new definition. This book added for me insight into the Bigger Picture. There have been numerous books on the engineering of the weapon, but no other, in my experience, that describes as carefully the background of the event. Definitely a ""Recommended Read""!Larry Auer"
5,"Miss Kincaid, we ought to thank you","This book is so well written it blew my mind. Berry's insights were always spot on and believably voiced. Miss Kincaid is an exceptional writer who deserves more attention than she gets. This is a book to be savored like fine wine.I was a little disappointed in the ending, however. I found it a stretch and not quite believable. Almost like it was written for a shock value, but it felt contrived. That said, I still think this is one of the best books I've read in quite some time."
4,Good southern novel,"I enjoyed this book because I could relate to the experiences of growing up in a tiny town in Florida. The story was never boring for me. I never wanted to put it down. If you want to read a coming of age novel set in the south, give this book a chance. I was bothered by a couple of things in the book, but I did not let it ruin the story for me.This could be considered spoilers so stop reading if you don't want to know..# 1. I did not understand why Berry seemed to think it was ok for her brother to molest her. I don't care what anyone says.. It was molestation. He put his hands on her body in a sexual manner. That is not right. Why was that even in the book? I didn't get it at all.#2. I also did not like when Berry let the older, criminal Raymond take advantage of her. I guess I could understand why she did it.. Her brother abused her. Her Father left. She was looking for love. It just disturbed me."
3,Light but enjoyable read,"I hate to say that going in to this book I had expectations but that's what happens when a quote on the back of the cover draws a thinly-veiled comparison between this novel and To Kill A Mockingbird. Mockingbird stands as one of my all-time favorite books and while some of the basic elements are there the comparison is a reach. That being said, it was still a good, fast read. There were some very sweet, poetic sentences that stood out and the characters were fairly well defined. The ending is what I felt weakened the book. I think the author intended the ending to be clear but references in the beginning of the novel clearly contradict it. If the author wanted it to be ambiguous then I don't feel it was in keeping with the tone of the story. If this sounds negative I don't intend it that way. I enjoyed the book and I've already lent it to a friend. I'm also going to look into this authors previous novels."
1,Bad science and worse logic,I never understood why the Da Vinci Camera Obscura theory was even suggested in the first place. One has to realize that Carbon 14 dates are a probability range and the range reported usually only has about a 66% probability. To get a 97% probability range one DOUBLES the original range. So given a 130 year range (1260-1390) there is a 97% chance that the Shroud has made between 1145 and 1405.So the latest the shroud can be dated with 97% likelihood is to c1405 but Leonardo da Vinci was not born until 1452 almost 50 years later. Furthermore the Shroud has a decent provenance (documented historical record) back to 1350 which pushes it another 50 years BEFORE Da Vinci was even born.This book like many of its ilk play on the public's ignorance of how science really works and leave out important data to create a story that is better suited to the fiction section.
1,A Half a star would be better rating,!Wow! Patetic. One star is a lot more than it deserved. They owe me the time I invest in this garbage.
1,Vomitus,This book is a joke that comes across as being written by a couple of losers who dress like goths and hang out in the mall instead of going to history class.Pure vomitus that is almost laughable if it did not pretend to be ascholarly work.
5,Great Product,"Exactly what I was looking for. With 12 ply, product is very absorbant and being real gauze doesn't have the ""fuzzy"" feel that the synthetic gauze has."
2,Not too impressed:(,"I read only half the book and was very uninterested. The whole frist part is just letters she received that are light-hearted but not funny. (I am a cancer patient myself) I have read funnier, more up-lifting books. Barbara Johnson has a great cancer book that I loved and laughed so many times out loud. I left this book at the cancer center for someone else to hopefully find hope in."
5,Back when TV was great,"Let me tell you, I LOVE this dvd. I have been waiting for these shows to be released on dvd format for a long time. You get the first episodes of 5 classic 70's cop shows.1. Charlies Angels2. The Rookies3. Starsky and Hutch4. Swat5. Police WomanI love all these shows, but I espacially love Police Woman and Starsky and Hutch. I grew up watching these shows, and there is not a cop show today that can hold a candle to these shows. I have some Charlie's Angels on dvd, and Starsky and Hutch on VHS from Columbia House, but I have missed watching Police Woman in over 25 years. I had a serious crush on Angie Dickinson back in the day. This is a great dvd of classic tv, when tv was entertaining, not all this reality crap that is on now. I just hope they realease more Police Woman and Starsky and Hutch on dvd. Its well worth the price and then some. Get it...."
2,DVD,Not as good as expected. Fault of the one who purchased he wasn't sure of exactly what he was getting
3,1st Person Shooter,"Not that great but Not the worst. Mostly first person shooter and more doom style gameplay and the suffering style prison escape except less scary but the graffics are better but difficult to see clearly all the time. Worst part Riddick doest do very much cool stuff other than hidding and see in the dark but you might like it, it's still fun to shoot stuff"
3,What A Joke,I bought the Xbox about 3 months ago and yes I like it but I have learned one thing. Every game released for it is extremely overhyped and when it comes out you find out the game is a joke like Riddick. First off no it isn't better then Halo which was a overhyped game but has good controls just like it. The setup is new compared to other games. The charecter models are so narrow and tall looking with everything having more jaggies around it then the best looking PS2 game. Im sorry I just keep finding myself getting lured into overhyped games for the Xbox which turn out horrid. Definatly play first and do not listen to the hype fanboys have given it because there not telling the truth in any way shape or form. Buy Rainbow Six 3 for the Gamecube or pre order Halo 2 instead.
1,Oops here comes another while we wait for Doom3/Halo2,"If you have alot of money to spend and have to play a game now then go for it. I would reccomend Full Spectrum Warrior (same release date.) FPS games are so common now that you should try something new and wait for the REALLY good FPS games that are coming: Doom 3, Halo2, Half-Life 2....yadayadayada. The game is also to short to constitute $50."
3,Awesome rental but dont buy it.,"this game has the best stealth since splinter cell, one of the most fun fighting things ever, good vo, and good graphics but that is it. Other than that it is easy, repetitive, boring, and no replay value. I played for 8 hours and was on 3rd to last thing. It bored me into selling it. Overall a great rental but dont buy it."
4,Best Movie Game Ever,"Not only is this game probably the best movie game to date, but it's an extremely good fps, stealth adventure, and first person brawler. The graphics are the best on any console to date, better than Ninja Gaiden and better than most games coming out in the next year. The dialogue is well written, the voice work is amazing, and the story is well done. The gameplay is great, first person fighting is incrediblyIt's short, but it's still easily worth $50."
3,Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay,FPS. This is based on the Chronicles of Riddick series. This takes place between the movie Pitch Black and Chronicles of Riddick. Riddick get captured and thrown into a jail. The object of the game is to escape the prison planet. Lots of stealth kills and action gun based kills. This game is a bit difficult and very dark in many cases. I dont highly recommend this game. I bought it because i like chronicles of riddick.
4,SLEEPER HIT OF THE YEAR!!,"Butcher Bay took me by surprise . I thought to myself when I rented this game. Its gonna be another lame movie based game. BOY WAS I EVER WRONG. Chronicles Rocks!! Very clean graphics and smooth gameplay. It felt like I was actually beating the ,you know what ,out of my opponent. Not to mention the great FPS aspect. Are you afraid of the dark?"
3,game is too short,"I bought it saturday afternoon, played it all evening, went to bed, got up sunday about 8am, played it all day and finished it before 5pm. Maybe 15 hours of game play on the normal difficulty.The visuals are great and the interface is easy to use. But I was left with wanting more to do. I was expecting at least a week of game time, not part of a weekend.Most of the game involves stealth. This is not a run in the middle of your enemies and shoot them all. Hide in the shadows and wait till one comes close and hit him from behind or just sneak around them in some cases."
3,Good but way overpriced,"I got this program to help with listening comprehension. It does a good job at that. Overall, the program is way overpriced. As one reviewer pointed out, it is mostly in the present progressive or the present tense. It helps one learn basic vocabulary and very simple sentences in the present tense, but is sorely lacking in teaching more complex grammar and more complicated vocal utterances. This is not a stand-alone program. You will need to study Spanish elsewhere to really learn the language. It does excel at teaching listening comprehension but you will need to supplement these CDs with plenty of other learning. In addition, I completed Level One and got stuck in Level Two because the exercises are so redundant and get to be tedious. I wish it had a better way to keep my interest."
2,"Expensive software with significant flaws,","We bought this software based on glowing reviews. What you get is a memory hog, slow loading program that requires the CD to run. The safedisc copy protection further slows down the computer.As for the actual application, Learning Spanish. The software shows you pictures of basic items, and plays a decently clear voice. You pick the pic to match the voice. This software is fantastically overpriced and over hyped. Listening to a Spanish Radio station would be a better route to learning Spanish."
1,Bad Disk,"My disk worked about two times before hanging up. Despite repeated calls to their tech support line and spending several hours on the phone, I've not been able to use it. It may be a great product but I can't get to it.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,Terrible licensing policy,"Be aware, if you finish the course and attempt to sell the product to anyone else, the company will not allow it. I attempted to sell this on eBay and the company shut down the auction without notice, even though I paid full price for the software. So if you buy this, beware."
1,Rosetta stone a misnomer,"The Rosetta Stone series derives its name from the famous archeological find that enabled moderns to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs.The reason this was possible was that the stone contained not only a hieoglyphic text but also Greek versions (demotic and ancient) that functioned as a parallel text providing the exact translation.That is how most normal conventional language learning texts are designed. The author provides a foreign text and an English text as a window to the foreign language text meaning.The Rosetta Stone series does just the opposite, and often it is unclear from the picture what the meaning is.Not a good course!"
1,Not at all worth the price,"It's nowhere helpful. I got this at a local store and it's annoying and requires a lot of patience. Attending a class is a lot lot better. 200+ dollars is rediculous for this. For that price , they should be able to program the language into our brains.LOL.Gouging is not a word that would quite describe this. $50-$60 would be an appropriate price. Even then I woulnd't recommend it."
3,Laptop Users: Be Warned!,"The Rosetta Stone application requires that the language CD be present in the harddrive, and it *continuously* spins up the CD disk while the program runs. This unfortunate design will quickly run down your laptop batteries, making this application unsuitable for travel. My repeated requests to Fairfield Technologies, the Rosetta Stone software company, to remedy this problem were declined. Considering the substantial price paid for this software, it should *behave* like software, and not a DVD. If the application could be installed and run like normal software, it would not uselessly drain you laptop batteries."
3,needs more 'nuts and bolts',"My two teenagers used Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 1. It is supposed to be equivalent to two years of high school Spanish. While it is quite colorful and fun, none of us felt it really taught the language in a useful way. I will have my elementary age children use it to become aquainted with Spanish and find something more instructive for them to use in high school. My daughter who used it said she wanted something that explained things. She wants to know the 'why' so that she can apply what she is learning in a broader manner than just parroting a lesson. She also wanted to learn something useful to say beyond 'The woman is walking with the man' or 'The boat is in the water'."
1,Waste of money,"I gave it a chance, was determined to learn, and finally gave up. It repeated images without translation, and gave no reference on what anything meant. Frustrated, I advanced to the next few lessons to see if I could learn anything at all, and found it useless. Repeating the words through a mic was useless as well, there were some that I repeated perfectly, and the program still wouldn't advance. I think there was a glitch in it. It was truly a waste of money. The advertisers for this product have flooded the market so you will believe its the best thing that ever happened. Well it isn't. I'm having more success with Instant Immersion, at 1/4th the cost. Rosette stone is a scam."
5,AWESOME awesome awesome,"this is a great way to learn spanish. also If you give it to a child, they will be speaking like a native in no time"
1,They lie to you to get you to buy,"Rosetta Stone claims there is a return policy of 6-months, I tried to return the product after 1-month and they wouldn't refund my money. I had actually called them on the phone and asked them before I bought the CD, and they assured me that the refund policy would apply. So, I got taken...Don't relay on a return policy, and don't buy this product unless you are certian you won't be upset when you get screwed."
1,Poor Spanish Program,"I am a teacher and considered using this software to learn Spanish. This product follows the didactic `behaviorist"" approach (1960s): It is based on imitation and functions by means of behavioral automatisms and mechanical reactions. The user is required to imitate the model (stimulus-response) and to memorize the words and their structures without understanding them. No explanation is provided. This method teaches an artificial language that would be difficult to adapt and apply to real life, where communication situations are much more complex and varied. The teaching method exerted here is centered on the content and not the student, and the student is subjected to conditioning. None of the activities are presented in any context."
4,Learning Spanish Made Easy,Four Plus Stars ! Excellent program for learning a new language allowing an individual to progress at their own pace. Highly Recommend This Program !
1,"Expensive , Poor choice to learn Spanish",Very tiresome and repetitious. The phrases are not usefull for travellers. The Pimsluer audio programs are MUCH more practical!! Save your money and don't bother with this very expensive piece of junk!!
1,Where is it?,"I would love to do a review a product I've heard so many wonderful things about, but it never arrived. Called customer service (somewhere in India apparently) only to have their computers either ""broken down"" or ""updating"". All this for a week straight. Also, they would say their systems are down and just hang up on you on a few occasions. There is another language I'd like to use...."
5,Speedo mount,I got this to relocate my speedo on my 2009 harley nightster. Fit little loose but I used electric tape to fill the difference. I also had to widen the mount hole a little. This is a great cheap way to relocate the speedo with little to no work. I highly recommend this.
3,It's ok but not if your child is a climber,"The table and chair are sturdy enough. I haven't used the paper yet. My daughter is a climber, so she would rather stand on the table and chair than sit. But when she sits, it's fine. She's 18 months and about 29"" and there's room to grow, but she can still see and play with her toys and draw on the table."
5,Nice little table!,"I ordered this for my grandson and was very pleased with the quality. I put it together myself and saw first hand how well it is built. My only concern is the tiny drawer. It really is too small to hold anything. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
4,Great table!,"Perfect for one child! JUST the right size. Not too big, not too small. SOLID wood and seems very durable. I put it together myself in about 40 mins while my kid was napping. It's fairly heavy so she wont be able to drag the table around the house like she does with plastic tables.She is 20 month old and very tall for her age and its perfect for her and has some room to grow into it. The table is labeled as 'for all ages' but I'd imagine it'd be pretty uncomfortable/awkward for like a 5 year old.My only complaint is that the chair wobbles a TINY TINY bit (one leg is ever so slightly shorter) but I easily fixed that. Oh and the little drawer is very very small...maybe can fit a few crayons, thats it. It's ok though. She doesn't care and I mostly got this table for her to eat on."
1,Install Errors !!!,"I bought this as Christmas present for my daughter who will be traveling to Italy this spring as part of a College course she is taking, and she will be spending a semister there next year as well ... She just called me for school to help her resolve an ERROR in the installation: The install reaches 100% then states it has encountered an ERROR, and quits. It remains uninstalled and is thus far UNUSABLE. An awefully expensive piece of plastic that does NOTHING. As a Senior Software Engineer I'd have been fired for less ... The RosettaStone WebSite/Knowledgebase offers NO information on this."
4,"Good baseline, but","I am in the middle of researching the best process & configuration for some W2K desktop systems at my work. This title was one of the ones recommended by some friends and in some trade articles I had collected.It is a good summary for the W2K newbie, not as detailed with pictures as a Dummy book or the 'step by step' titles; but was not in depth enough for what I needed. I thought it was well broken down, and the flow of the book seemed to work well. This title helped set the groundwork & baseline for what I needed, filling in the gaps from my personal experiences but it did not meet my expectations or all my needs.Needing some hard procedures for locking down the systems, and some procedures for installs I found the title <b>Windows 2000 Deployment and Desktop Management</b> (ISBN 0735709750) exactly what I needed.This title is more specific on a specific computers W2K install and config, instead of a W2K install & config through an entire operation/enterprise."
4,Perfect inexpensive PC,"I've had the Compaq Presario 5430US PC for 3 years. The only problem was a hard drive that went bad one year ago. Otherwise, the PC has run flawlessly. No Complaints. In additon to the 5430US, I own an HP Pavilion m1070n. Not one complaint. :-)"
5,Stunning and Informative!,"A visual feast plus a well written and interesting history of the boot. Pages and pages of beautiful boots in sharp and colorful detail. More than just eye candy, this book is an absolute must for anyone interested in adding an authentic western flair to thier design work regardless of the media."
4,Art of the Boot by Tyler Beard,"I give this book a 4 out of 5 because I was hoping for a little more history on the boot and maybe a little more info on how the boot pertained to the old west. This book had a huge variety of photos and photos that were well taken, but they were mostly very colorful ""fancy"" boots. If you're looking for some funky looking boots, this is your book"
5,The best boot book!,This book is a boot lovers dream come true! The quality of photography is excellent and the historical discussion brings the art of bootmaking to life. There are so many styles of boots represented here as well as bootmakers past and present from all over the United States. The art of the boot is a love affair that covers the world and this book gives ample voice and photographic interpretation to that subject.
4,Cibelle - Cibelle,"Cibelle is the latest addition to the burgeoning Brazilian chill movement -- but she's certainly a welcome addition. With a beautifully sweet voice and interesting arrangement, she manages to squeak ahead of the group. ""Waiting,"" for instance, is a delicate piece of work, which manages to convey the sounds your mind makes while you're twiddling your thumbs. The Portuguese lyrics keep the proceedings authentic, as does the music -- it's spiced with the uniquely Brazilian mixture of jazz and rhythm. While many of the tracks fade into the background, like a Rio de Janeiro dream, ""No Prego"" and ""Inutil Paisagem"" manage to perk up the ears. Cibelle is an auspicious start."
4,Wonderful Debut,I feel that this is a wonderful and important debut CD. In a music world that serves up more of the same Cibelle stands out and Apollo 9 is someone that we will all be hearing about for some time to come.
2,Bossa nova or enjoo?,"I agree with Songba. Cibelle seems to be surfing the nova bossa a little too casually. I bought this because I was so impressed by her work on Suba's Sao Paolo Confessions but she seems to be missing the late, great and tragically demised producer even more than the rest of us. Her vocals did the trick just right when backed up by Suba's creative genius but on this offering they just seem cliched and some of the lyrics made me squirm.Shame on Ziriguiboom, who I had previously trusted as a consistent 'blind buy'."
3,"Cheap, Works, but Not Like It's Black Twin","I bought this, thinking that it was equivalent to the CRW-UINB model from Sabrent. It's the same thing specs wise but black in color. Based on reviews of the black one, some people were said that it worked with their SDHC cards.I figured it would be the same with this model, but NOT SO. Using a Trancend 8GB SDHC Class 6 Card and it does not work with this reader.Tried a 1GB memory stick duo pro card and 1GB miniSD which both worked fine.So this reader works great provided you ain't using SDHC. Don't bother getting help from Sabrent. I've emailed them and gotten no response."
2,CF2 slow on Vista,"The USB 2 port works fine, but the CF2 card reader is incredibly slow. I think updated drivers would help, if they existed. I cannot find Windows Vista drivers for this card reader, anywhere."
1,discontented customer,Retailer sent wrong product. No way to exchange. Will not order through Amazon again.
5,Seen the two of them LIVE,"I have seen Colin and Brad perform live on their tours and they are hysterical! I am a huge fan of Whose Line Is it Anyway - so when I saw that Colin and Brad were touring I just had to get tickets!They do a really great two man show - and get the audience involved as much as possible.I have seen them at the Just for Laughs in Toronto - as well as road tripped 6 hours through New York state to Schenectady NY to see them as well. They were worth it - and i hung around long enough after the show to catch them as they were leaving to say hello and to sign my Whose Line DVD's. They were super friendly and made the trip well worth while!!I am very excited for this DVD to add to my collection. Way to go Colin and Brad! I was hoping you would put out a DVD and you did. :)I will recommend this to anyone who is a Whose Line fan, and give it 5 stars because you never fail to crack me up and put me in a good mood."
5,Colin & Brad: Two Man Group,"This video is histerically funny. I would recommend this to anyone who has watched ""Who's Line Is It Anyway"" and enjoys improv comedy. I've seen them live with my 3 sons several times, so this made it a must to buy so that we could laugh anytime we want. It's better than a t-shirt souvenir."
3,Not funny enough to watch again,"I have enjoyed ""Whose line is it anyway"" DVDs and have watched them multiple times. This one was like a B movie.It was okay but not worth watching again. They are brilliant stand up comedians. They just are more funny when it isthe four of them which includes Wayne Brady and Ryan Stiles."
5,Very funny!,My wife and I watched this together. There were a couple of times when she had tears in her eyes from laughing so hard. I liked it a lot also. The mouse trap bit is great! I would buy more of Colin & Brads dvds. I would buy from this seller again.
3,"Quick, Funny, and Inventive","""Colin Mochrie & Brad Sherwood: Two Man Group"" is a live stage show starring the two comics who appeared on the Emmy-winning ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?"" These veterans of improv comedy have performed their wild and outrageous shows to audiences nationwide.Their shows are interactive and completely improvised. No two are ever the same. This involves amazingly quick minds, a lightning-fast sense of humor, and sheer courage. Using only their quick wit and a few audience volunteers, Mochrie and Sherwood create original, hilarious scenes. The show runs just over one hour.Special features include ""The Dos and Don'ts of Improv"" and interviews with the two comics."
4,nice map,Nice map for major roads etc. These are not detailed maps by no means. But they are perfect to be in my harley saddle bags when I need a map to get home or etc. They are all covered in plastic and fold great. I have them encase my cell phone GPS does dead and I have no idea where I am.
2,Small and condensed; part of state on back,"I love traveling West Virginia and constantly go through highway maps when planning trips (I like to mark routes and destinations). I thought this map would be perfect since you can use dry erase markers on it and if I end up changing my trip, all I have to do is erase and reroute... and it's great for that, but I hate the size of the map. It's quite a bit smaller than regular road maps, making it harder to read and I hate that the eastern panhandle is on the back - very inconvenient! If I had known the layout of this map prior to purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it and would've stuck with my free road maps from the state."
3,IZO BRAIN TWISTER,"WOW WHAT A MOVIE.VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN, IZO IS A MONSTER, A SUPPER HUMAN BEING, OR THE DEVIL. VERY GOREY AND ALOT OF SPECIAL EFFECTS. MEN WOULD LOVE IT AND WOMEN WILL TOSS IT. YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK."
1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would.","This movie was terribly hard to comprehend. An evil spirit is returned to Earth to wreak havoc on all who come in his path.True to form for many Japanese samurai & horror movies, there was a lot of slashing & blood spouting; but aside from that, there was no story that I could follow.While some people will applaud the director for making a ""David Lynch"" or ""Cronenberg"" style movie, it was (for me), little more than a waste of time.It was so bad, that I gave up watching the last 30 minutes.If you really want to see this movie, hire it, don't waste your money buying it."
1,CRAP!,Don't waste a single penny on this movie! It was total crap!No plot what so every and the main character was horrible! My eyes are still burning from this one!
1,Martial Mush,"Maybe it's me but I cant understand why some martial movies don't stick to the format of a basic story line nothing to compilcated but simple, wrapped around well designed fight scenes. But this movie was like nothing I had seen before or could have imaged in my wildest dreams. It's an onslaught of blood and gore making no sense at all, and no attempt to put together a good fight throughout the film. Why do these people think that most people buy martial arts movies it's for the FIGHTING, FIGHTING, FIGHTING and maybe if you'll lucky you will find one that has a decent story line.This movie is so bad that I dont know anyone I could give it to, maybe I could get rid of it at a flea market?"
2,Not What Was Expected,"To see this is interesting to say the least. I can now say I have. I will check if off my viewing. To keep it? Not unless I like school children muttering philosophy. Not unless to make his point, Izo uses a sword like a meat cleaver without thinking. The plot is just a jumble of supposedly pointed thoughts, but in the end its a film without a true plot. The color and style are intriguing, but in the end if you want something for your DVD library - it might not be worth it. If you want to live in anti-traditional mixed up painting, this is it. I will pass."
3,Worth more than 1 viewing,"Miike is certainly not a conventional filmmaker and this may be his most unconvetional film. That doesn't make it bad(far from it), nihlism & self destruction are the main themes played out in an almost acid trip of a movie.For some reason it reminds me of The Last Temptaion of Christ splattered in blood, begging for mercy and asking the ultimate truth of human suffering.(with some really great cameos)Only for true Miike fans."
4,Heavily influenced by Nietzsche. one of Miike's deepest!,"Anti-God, Anti-Society, Anti-Love, Anti-Humanity, Anti-Creation, Anti-Existence... IZO is raging, confused, helpless and nihilistic. he can be anytime, anywhere. Monster or Messiah? you decide."
2,Very wearying tale of nonstop bloodshed,"I'm a fan of Miike, but _Izo_ is just too much. There's no plot whatsoever, just a poor unfortunate reincarted samurai wandering through time and space and killing everyone who crosses his path. That's it! End of sentence! If you think you can stand over two hours of this, give it a try. If you're looking for something with even a rudimentary plot, you might want to try something else, like _Audition_ or _Ichi the Killer_. I'd rather watch the incomprehensible _Gozu_ again than be forced to sit through _Izo_. It is a beautifully-photographed, but ultimately pointless film. Maybe the 6th or 7th other film Miike directs this year will be more interesting."
3,An Okay CD but Rushed,"I have owned this CD for about 2 weeks and It wasn't really what I was expecting... Most of the songs on the CD were recorded in a rush so the songs aren't as good as they should be... ""She's A Star"" is a good song though....."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is one of the worst CDs I've heard lately. Boring, poor production, bad vocals, ""bad"" lyrics, and very amateurish music. Five unoriginal songs of complete ""junk"" Sorry. Don't waste your money or time on this band, you will only be disappointed."
4,Not quite perfect.,"This is my first Jacquie D'Alessandro book and I enjoyed it. I thought she did an excellent job turning a tired jilted-girl-seeking-revenge-on-boy plot into a fresh story. Dr. Nathan is a hunky hero that clearly loves Victoria from the start. ""Not Quite A Gentleman"" is wrought with sexual tension between the main characters. The mystery was light and didn't bog down the romance. Who reads Romance for the mystery? The love scenes are poignant but infrequent.The reason I didn't give it 5-stars is the first half dragged a bit for me. I found myself thinking, ""Okay, now get on with it!"". Otherwise, I recommend this book as an enjoyable read and I anxiously await Colin's story."
2,QUITE DISAPPOINTING... NOT AT ALL LIKE HER OTHER NOVELS,"Unfortunately, this one just didn't grab me at all. Although the story had the same sweet and endearing qualities like Jacquie's other books, NOT QUITE A GENTLEMAN was a very slow read for me and not quite as engaging as her other novels, which I love and enthusiastically devour!Although the early development of Nathan's and Victoria's relationship seemed promising and worthwhile reading about, the storyline was feeble and the story uninteresting. The plot lacked backbone and the story, with an underlying spy-thriller backdrop was a thin. I struggled to get into this book and the only reason I finished it because it is bacause it is a Jacquie D'allessandro book. I am trying not to be too disparaging in my review but needless to say it was disappointing, as her other novels have been a totally winning read for me and the protagonists engaging and charismatic. Not so this book. Sorry Jacquie!"
5,Pedipeds,"These shoes are easy to get on and off, they seem to be comfortable, everyone is always commenting on how cute they are, and my son has no problem walking in them. I would reccomend these shoes to anyone."
3,"Cute, but no support","I was very excited about the Pediped brand so I ordered this for our child. He walked around fine in them, though they are slippery on certain surfaces. I wouldn't buy these again. Our son was going to a physical therapist and she insisted we buy him hard bottom shoes (ie stride rite - typical athletic shoes) to help him learn to walk better. It was annoying to spend so much and then to learn from a professional that these are not a good choice for new walkers. I am not sure who these pediatricians are that are endorsing this product, but I wanted to pass on that my real expert was not impressed. I still think they are cute and they were easy to get on and off."
2,"Very cheap, flimsy plastic",The plastic this part is made out of is so thin and flimsy that I cracked the adapter just taking the packaging wrap off of it. It cracked again when I was adjusting the air cleaner after using the adapter on my car.
2,Finally got some courage gave up on these guys and...,"...went to Google Apps. Lost some of the ACT whistles and bells, but I have to say it was well worth it. The Act people are like Congress, all they want to do is get re-elected. Seems to me like they want to keep you captive. Got tired of their carp and made the change to Google Apps."
2,not that easy,"where is the hardware? why not have some good instructions?what i thought the product did ,it does ok . but getting to the point of attatching to the saw and to the track are not clear because of product design flaws.such a good idea wasted through production."
1,Can't be made to work,It may fit some saws but not my Festool 55. I bought it thinking that it might be a work around for buying the rather pricy Festool guide rail system. Not a chance. Simply can't be made to work satisfactorily. Save your money.
1,This item does not work,"I don't normally write reviews, but the saw plate, and it's sibling, the router plate are really worthless. The clamp itself works well, but the cheaply made plastic plates will not slide at all on the clamp bar. This could be weather dependent, since my garage is quite cool, but the plates should slide regardless of the temperature. If you take the plate out of the track (gliding only on a portion of the track) then it will slide, but what good is that since it would be easy to cut crooked, if you didn't keep pressure on the clamp side.Believe me, using your saw or router directly against the clamp bar will work better than using one of these lousy plates. I paid $63.00 for these two plates (including shipping), and this was one of the worst things I've ever bought."
1,do not recomend,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but I was very dissapointed in this book. Like the other reviewer, I found many mistakes- both simple editing mistakes and completly wrong answers on some of the practice questions. With so many mistakes that I noticed, I am afraid that I may have been learning wrong information in areas that I was less familiar with and would not be able to catch the mistake.I have not used other books to be able to compare, but I would imagine that anything else would have to be better."
2,Too many errors,"The math information is decent in the book, but you can get that info in most other GRE prep books. The essay help section is not as good as other books, and the example essays looked like they would score a 4 if you compare them to the essays in my other prep book.I only took the first paper exam's math section, but I had to stop because I found so many errors in just that section! In addition to the problems mentioned in other reviews with this test, questions 22 and 23 had wrong answers. One of the numbers the author was using was much lower than what the actual graph was showing!I think the 1st exam's math questions only got to medium/hard level, with no very hard questions.This book clearly was not edited by anyone other than the author before publishing.Get a different book!"
4,Simple and Driving Worship.,"""I Will Give Thanks"" is my fav song because of its vengence rythm! ""You Bless Me Lord"" is profoundly beautiful in expressing love to God in midst of grief and pain."
1,californiagirl,"I am nearly finished using the entire box, and have experienced neither a reduction in stress or appetite. I would not purchase this product again. Save your money."
1,Dont Buy it,"Same as the wolfwood, this looks so cool but it aint my cup of tea. It's head will go off if you'll gonna make it move just right after taking it out of the box. It's not durable ( i wish it was ). No point in discussing this disgusting piece of Bla Bla Bal..."
2,Pizza didnt cook well,"OK Im not a great pizza maker. I donot know what went wrong, but my top portion of the pizza browned but botton crust was not cooked properly. I cooked it in a pan on stove, after taking it out from the oven."
5,Great Book for Those Just Learning About Dog Training,"I purchased this book for my son (age 14) when he received a puppy for his birthday. It is fantastic. The steps of dog training are explained in a very simple manner with lots of pictures. Both he and I used the techniques described in the book to train the puppy (a Sheltie). Within a few weeks, the dog was able to sit, give us his paw and lie down on command. I am going to buy another copy of this book to give to my brother and his wife, who just purchased a puppy."
3,Ok but VERY Basic.,This book has some good ideas and good techniques but it is VERY basic and short. Seems more like a picture oriented training manual for kids. Not really what I was looking for but ok if you just want some good advice and pictures.
5,New Complete Dog Training Manual,"Well written book that was fun to read and to review over and over. The book has many pictures that demonstrated the different training activities. The book read by the whole family, including my kids (ages 7 - 18). It is a great reference book for training a dog."
3,Good starter info,"A simple book, easy to follow.Its a little heavy on the treats system for me to say I Love it. It does however, tell you to eventually wean out the treats and replace with praise.It certainly helped my daughter get a start on working with our puppy, and it does have plenty of other good tips on restraint, and control.I really want to give it 4 stars... but the treat thing... just keeps it at 3.5"
1,Pictures Without Substance,"This is a nice coffee table picture book. However, when a specific behavior issue comes up about my dog's behavior the text is lacking. Wish the author would give more specifics on the select topics covered in this book. Not an on the spot survival kit!"
3,Good if you have win. 98 - xp.,"I hoped this would help me with some fillms that I wanted to record, only I have win vista, witch does dot work with this software."
5,A real life experience,"One never believes that a song can trully capture the essence of a feeling or a life, but amazingly this song does. It is so full of heart and truth, that when I heard it I cried. IT's a definite 5..."
5,Powerful Song,"The lyics to this song(Austin) are so great that it moved me to tears the first time I heard it. I had to run right out and buy it. Blake puts so much feeling behind the words, that you'd think he was singing about a personal experience of his own."
5,New Country Star,great song! Is a song you'll remember. Hoping for this to top the charts because he deserves it. Look for more hits from this dynamic vocalist.
5,great price for multiple stories,This book has 6 stories in one book. What a wonderful treat not to have to tote multiple books around the house or into the car when we travel. My kids love to watch Arthur on TV. This is a much better way to spend time with the kids reading than watching a tv program. There are so many colorful pages to look at and cute stories at a great price.
4,"4 stars for the music, 5 stars for production and engineering","This CD is a little jewel: While it might not be earth-shattering musically, it really shines in the fields of production and sound engineering. It was taped from live sessions and with all-out acoustic instruments - and that's audible. The bass picking in the three interludes (""Heart"", ""Mind"" and ""Soul"", in which Intrigue explain their philosophy of ""Acoustic Soul"") for example comes across so lively and realistic that you almost see the player in your living room. This CD is for the audiophile who likes to listen black Soul music.I'd like to add a little caveat: When you look for more CDs by ""Intrigue, Amazon will return two more albums. But neither ""Intrigue"" (link:Intrigue) nor ""Progression"" (link:Progressionare from this band. ""Intrigue"" was taped by some Curtis Gaines, while ""Progression"" comes from an obscure hip-hop band named ""2ndGin"" stammt and is simply rubbish."
3,"Product great, Amazon sucked","I am pretty sure that Amazon sent me a refurb version of this product, even though I bought a new one. None of the peripherals were in the box (cables, trays, manuals, etc) and it didn't work. Primera support was great, however, and they immeadiately replaced it. The replacement works wonderfully."
1,Could have been a lot better,"Honestly, the author has just spliced together all of NASA's tired old astronaut biography sheets which are available for absolutely nothing on the NASA web site. He could at least have updated them, as the information is dated to whenever NASA typed out each bio sheet. All of the other information that I saw contained in this book is available on the web for free or by writing to NASA, and I'm wondering if the ""author"" did anything at all in putting this book together other than assembling all the bio and fact sheets and giving it all untouched to the publisher. For the price you have to pay for this ""book"" he could at least have spent a bit of time deleting all the deceased wives and including children who weren't born when these bio sheets were written. I bet NASA are pretty unhappy about this so-called ""author"" profiting by simply reproducing word-for-word their freely-given information sheets."
5,GOOD INFO BUT NOT UPDATED,Good comprehensive book but author did not update info that was already available before the book was published.
4,This is great but too expensive,"I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I think some of the vocabulary you have to learn wasn't well chosen, for example the parts about cowboys and also there are some tools I don't even know the names of in English. Also you learn numbers kind of haphazardly. The vocabulary is repeated in subsequent lessons instead of being all new in each lesson. I guess that is ok but since you can review the old lessons anyway if I were buying this I would want as much as I could get for the money. The lessons are easy, most of the lessons are beginning, not intermediate, with short sentences or just words. But occasionally you come across some harder lessons.This is good if what you need is listening and speaking practice. You can always get a grammar book at the library. I am currently trying the online version and so far I like it just fine. I wouldn't mind having my own copy but it is a little too expensive for me."
1,NO!,"This was not a good purchase. The program came with 2 books, one was written in Russian! I have no idea what it's about!!!!!The other book was generic instruction, in English, but nothing about how to use this course. I was lost from the beginning. EVERYTHING of apparent value was written in Russian! I don't read or write Russian. This was a waste of money for what might have been a good course. Beware."
1,tech support sucks,"I am an American living in Kyrgyzstan. I ordered this product in May and it is a good, easy to use course. My laptop crashed (motherboard). I purchased a new laptop and installed the software. The software executes, but won't find the language files on my new computer. I emailed tech support at their website three times without a reply. So I sprang for the phone call to Virginia. The tech I spoke with insisted that my package came with 2 discs. One for the application and one for the language files. This simply not true. And it worked perfectly on my old laptop. It has one disc and one disc only. No help. Out $200.00"
4,review of Word 2007 for Dummies,"Index was not as organized as I wanted. I was looking up spacing and got letter spacing instead of line spacing, but that was solved. Written well and concise, everything you ever wanted to know."
3,Book Review,"Although ""wordy"" I could not find solutions to 2 problems I have. I have purchased the Word card. Perhaps my solutions will be resolved with that product."
2,WORD 2007,"Word 2007 For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))Just another dummy book. This one is okay I guess, but not as good as the others that I have read. Too much of the goofy stuff that is really not needed, even for dummies......unless you are really into goofy reading material. I like a little humor in anything, but less would have been more in this one!"
3,Review for Word for dummies,Does not provide a cross reference between old and new locations for the commands.
3,Unanswered Question,"Why has Microsoft fixed what wasn't broken? Word 2003 was fine ""as is,"" and this newest version largely a confusion. Word 2007 For Dummies simply confirms that the cure is worse than the illness, and though this book may help tech-savy users, the rest of us are left where we were found, in the dark."
5,Delivery,What Book? It is 9/22/2010 and I STILL have not received the Book!!. Post office states that it was returned to shipper. Where is it?
1,Really dumb,"I'm a big fan of the Dummies series; the information is usually complete and explained well. The Word 2007 volume, however, is nothing but fluff. The writer explains the features of Word 2007 by using words like ""thing"" and ""stuff"". The banter is usually tolerable (or easy to skip over) in the Dummies series, but this book has so much of it that it's no surprise there is no room for explaining new features such as the new interface, particularly the ribbon. The writer says the ribbon can't be modified. That's not true. Reading this book is like eating cotton candy."
2,expected more information,"I have read many of the Dummies books and they have helped me enormously. This time I am disappointed. Since Word 2007 has a completely different screen, I hoped you would show different screens for each of the new drop-down lists so we could find it easier. This is more like another book on Word, without relating to the vast changes in the 2007 edition, which is what I needed most for work."
5,These guys ROCK!,"I was out in Phoenix on a business trip and caught these guys at the Rhythym Room. They openned for Ray Condo and the Ricochets. These guys totally burned the house down. Of all the swing revival bands out there, I think these guys blow the doors off of 'em. Not only do they have that ""heartland"" grit to then but have you heard this guy play bass? I play bass and this guy is just incredible. You need to buy this CD! No doubt about it!"
1,More of the same,"About 2 years past the mini-boom in jump blues, these tired tracks don't come close to making a case for another revival. The melodies are predictable, the rhythms all clipped from better musicians, and the guitar work uninspired. There really isn't a song (or a singer) worth highlighting. Very disappointing, but the post-college yuppie larvae will no doubt flock to the music as a means to show how down and dirty they can really be without having to actually experience the grit."
4,sounds good . lets hope it stays,"what a relief to actually buy a metalcore album and not be terribly disappointed. as a huge fan of bands like darkest hour and as i lay dying, these guys are simply awesome. although they share similarities with the two bands previously mentioned, there is something fresh and new about these guys. focusing not as strongly on breakdowns and heavy hitting mosh metal, the sound is much more ... rocking. its fast paced, and then slows down from time to time, then followed by a blasting guitar solo. and the lyrics are intriguing as well. im tired of hearing the crap about my girlfriend dumped me and im so sad and emo and this all sucks. IT SUCKS. its good to see a band with a different idea on the music they should play. this is an awesome cd.. i just hope that their days with victory records doesn't lead them to certain doom.... cough.. atreyu"
3,not bad for the money,At first glance when pulling them out of the box I thought no big deal.As i aired them up and got them on the road they proved to work fine .They are on a motorized bike and I traveled 30 miles on their first run with no problem.No Slideing or anythig.
5,So Awesome and Funny,"This dvd box set is one of the best purchases I've ever made, I just love it.Incredibly cool funny funny funny."
2,Old Dutch International 47-Bottle Matte Black Arched Wine Rack,The box was delivered opened (looked like returned merchandise). Wine rack is cheaply made and not correctly designed for a heavy load. This wine rack is not safe if you have small children in the house can easily fall if pulled on.
1,"Flimsy, bad design","While putting it together one of the attachments broke off without much pressure. But we tried anyway. When it was all put together, one leg was about an inch shorter than the other three. But still we tried. With two pieces of cardboard under the short leg it still seemed unsteady. Not something I would trust my collection of wines in! I will be returning this one."
4,2nd multi-plier I've bought in 20 years.,The first Gerber multi-plier I bought has lasted 20 yrs and is still working. Just rattles a little and the saw is worn down from cutting drywall. I bought this one because I can't walk around without my Gerber on my belt. Until you need one and don't have one you will probably not understand.
2,Should have got the leatherman,"I recently lost my leatherman and was looking for a new multi-tool. The one I had was great and I never had any issues, but I left it on a job site. I went on to buy the same one and I noticed this one was the same price but had better reviews. I have never used the gerber multi-tool before and so far I am very disappointed. The slide out pliers, seem very cumbersome compared to the fold out. Also I don't like that I can't open the handle fully to use the screwdriver at angles or with extended reach. I'm not sure why this product got such great reviews, in all likely hood I will give it away and buy a leatherman again. I should have listened to the age old rule of ""stick with what you know""."
5,Great Birthday present,This was a great present. I am handicapped and the locking tools finally will keep me from needing help fixing cuts from the tools that dont lock.The push out pliers are great as well keeping the tool small and SUPER usable Great tool
4,"Nice Tool, but skip the black finish","I own both the Black Diesel and the ""regular"" or dull silver Diesel. They are both GREAT tools, that frankly I would not head out into the wilds of Alaska without them (I carry one, my son carries the other). The black one has Curb Appeal, BUT it is a little stiffer to open - the black finish makes the tolerances a bit close. The ""regular"" or dull silver one opens smooth as silk.On a remote Motorcycle trip this summer, I used my Diesel to repair a broken fuel line on one of our cycles - WITHOUT my Diesel we would have had one cycle hard down, over 125 miles from ANYWHERE. When you cannot carry a whole toolbox, for gosh sakes ALWAYS take a MULTITOOL."
4,Pretty good with some flaws.,"The multi-plier arrived with a defective set of scissors so I had to immediately send it back at my cost for shipping to Gerber. However, they did promptly fix it and send a replacement. I have used it several times at work and so far its holding up just great - the knife is superbly sharp and the pliers seem very strong. The ""black film"" on the hands that some people are experiencing is just the excessive lubrication they put on the tool before shipping to ensure ease of one-handed opening. It's easily wiped off with a rag and can be re-lubricated as necessary. The one-hand opening action varies from easy to stiff from tool to tool and you may have to adjust the sliding screws and add or remove lubricant as necessary, but once tuned it works great."
3,"It's good, but go with plain silver","I like it overall, the blade is great and all the tools in the handle come out smoothly. What I didn't care for though was the pliers don't come out so well. They don't snap out with the flick of the wrist like the other one I had. I think it's due to the black powder coating. Also I've had it only a few days and the black is already coming off. I have a feeling it'll be half silver in a few weeks. Functionality is great, but I'd go with the silver one."
2,Didn't care for it,"I have had my trusty Gerber multi tool 400 for 15 years and finally I broke the knife blade, so I decided to get this 1. What I didn't like about it is, it is much too big and bulky when wearing it. I didn't like the black either as it is hard to see it at night, and the tools are hard to get out of it. If you are planning on using the phillips head screwdriver...forget it! It is paper thin and will just damage the screwhead instead of removing it. I guess they did that to cram more tools into it. Overall I love Gerber tools, however this one did not impress me, I guess I will just get the same old 400 again, It proved itself strong over and over again. J"
5,big enough to be a real tool box,"I lost my first one and had to get a second right away, I use it for everything on my farm and on the job. The tools and blades are super. The desiel replaced my smaller gerber which could not handle many common performances. Easy to use, all tools lock securely and opens smoothly. This is my third year with this fine tool. You will never see me without it on my belt."
4,A good tool.,"Pretty much everything I expected. Gerber makes a good quality product. The comparison between Gerber and Leatherman came down to the one hand operation. As a police officer, I may not have the ability to use both hands, so the one hand operation was my selling point. I do have a Leatherman product in my wish list so both are good quality. The Diesel was the right size and the black finish has yet to be tested in a saltwater enviroment such as the gulfcoast where I am. I assume it as with anything else, take care of your equipment and it will take care of you!"
4,Confirmed all my worst fears (NOW I LOVE IT),"Never been a multi-tool fan and this product confirms my preference for a simple, good, knife. What else do you really need?This particular tool that I received was HEAVILY lubricated with some kind of oil. Spent a good fifteen minutes just cleaning it up before I could use it. It appears very sturdy. The pliers are good size and heavy duty, but the small tools are too small and appear delicate. I anticipate breaking this pretty quickly. The fold-out tools are also hard to get to and don't fold out easily.Looks cool in all black.I'm going to try to get used to it but in the meantime I'm not giving up my Kershaw ZT's.EDIT - After a couple months with this tool I have to admit my first impression was wrong. I use this all the time and today I used it to save my new kitchen floors from being destroyed by a leaky pipe.In truth, it's held up well and I find myself going to it almost daily.Give it a try."
1,Great Tool- Terrible Finish,"This tool is great- but the black coating is not. My hands are completely covered in a black, oily substance that is coming off of the tool immediately upon taking it out of the box. It's too bad, because it looks nice, but clearly is not made to withstand even minor use."
3,Let 's See !,"Well first of all, when I received it, the package was crushed, box damaged beyond repair( it was a gift). I wouldn't recommend the black diesel, not a powder-coated finish. Knife blade was already used upon receiving it. Wouldn't recommend buying one from amazon.com ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great multi-tool,"Great tool, the only qualm is the rough sharpening of the knife blade, it needs honing to keep an edge well. The blade's hyper-fine point is prone to breakage if you think it's a great idea to thrust this blade into hard wood. Doesn't effect the use of the knife in any way and it's still completely intact."
4,Great tool,"This tool is great,it operats fantastic, the only thing that I dont like is that there is only one blade, I would be happier if there was a blade in place of the scisors."
1,stop block,the block didnt fit the rail I had. made for a different formatrail. been long enough that I dont remember the outcome.
1,Clamp Stop,"This plastic stop block is a waste of money. Forget any micro adjustment, as the whole thing lacks the rigidity to stay locked in one position."
3,Great for beginner readers,"I was 11 or so when my dad gave me this book. Conan captured my imagination and really got me reading. Howard can really captivate your imagination with his incredible scenes and combat. I read every Conan book as a child and those written by other authors as well. As an adult, I have different tastes now. But I will always remember my Conan stories."
4,Not always the exact same shade,"I ordered three packages of green bulb covers, 9 covers in total, because all the covers in my gauges didn't match very well. One of the nine is enough of a different tint that it bothers me. If your particular about this sort of thing, you might want to consider buying an extra package. I'm sure Amazon and/or Autometer would stand behind their product, but I'd rather pay the extra few dollars for some spares than deal with returning such an inexpensive product."
2,No Go,"This was not one of my favorites. The filming looked low budget. The actors are new and young so the quality of the acting was not great. The girl played too coy for my liking. The guy was trying to come off as being a laid back charmer, but he just couldn't pull it off. Also, just in general, the cheesiness factor was a little too high for my taste. Better luck next time kids."
1,The fit is way off!!!,The fit was way off. Too bulky at the shoulders and chest & too fitted at the bottom. It is as if top half & bottom half are 2 different sizes! Also fabric feels cheap. Immediately returned for refund.
4,Office 2007 for Dummies,"Basic introduction of the Office 2007 software. The little hints and tips are a plus. Lacks when discussing the more advanced content, but that was expected."
3,Office for Dummies All in One,This book was very informative but it would be much better with some practice sessions and some test sections.
3,Helps - somewhat,Like so many I've been using Microsoft products for years. I bought the book to smooth out some of the questions about new features. The author did more to confuse me than to explain things. After some frustrating reading and re-reading - I closed the book and did it the old fashioned way - trail & error. Learned a lot more that way than by reading. Could be that my reading skills need more help than my MS Office skills.
1,It wasn't helpful at all.,I brought this book thinking it was going to help me but it gave me bits and pieces of information. Which wasn't helpful at all for me. I wish I would have just brought the Office Book through Microsoft which I will be doing here at Amazon.com
4,Microsoft Strikes Again,"Just when you get comfortable with software, the vendor ""upgrades"" it. This book helps, but, as usual, it is out of date within three years."
3,Office 2007 for Dummies,"To be honest, I haven't used this enough to give it a higher rating but I like having it handy for reference in case I encounter an issued with any of my MS Office components."
2,Ok for Beginners,"I actually returned this book, which I don't do often. I was hoping it would be more like Office 2003 Timesaving Techniques for Dummies, which doesn't seem to have a 2007 version yet, but was very basic. And it doesn't address Business Contact Manager at All.Granted, it's trying to cover a lot of ground in one book. But if you're pretty proficient with Office programs, you may not learn much. It would have been more useful if it at least had a section that discusses all the changes between the 2 versions."
4,Excellent Beginner Book,"Readable, useful, humorous. I knew Word and Excel 2003 and needed to upgrade those to 2007 and learn Access and Outlook from start. This book would get you from no knowledge to being able to use the four programs I read about. It doesn't cover advanced topics - how to duplicate Access entries and make changes in the duplicate, for example - but you'll be ready to understand a more advanced guide."
2,Offine 2007,Very basic info. No list of Excel commands. Very basic formula commands. Wish had bought a different book.
5,The Dummies have done it again,"This book cover the Windows Office Suite. It is not intense on any of the programs but gives you a general knowledge of each. If you want to get more in depth you should get a one program only Dummies book or if you want to get real technical get a program bible. But to get a basic knowledge of the 8 programs that make up the suite, this is an excellent choice. Dummies make a good line of books. As a computer support tech, we used these books all the time for a variety of subjects."
2,"I'm no dummy, and this book isn't terribly helpful","I'm actually not too bad in Office 2007, but we got this for the office in case somebody had a question I couldn't answer. This book has failed to even address many of our questions. I've had much better luck just Googling the questions and getting an answer from another user or from Microsoft itself."
5,Very Quick Delivery,"I am still working on this one. It gives an outline in the first chapter on how most of 2007 operates and the changes. It is also instructional if you just want to complete one operation by itself. Once you get to just surrender to ""the ribbon"" and switch over to their new thinking (instead of just leaving it alone-the way it was, unbroken)you get the hang of it. I have yet to use ALL my office programs in the powerful way they promise because everyone I share office with don't use all the products together."
3,Great to have at your desk.,I first got this book to become familar with the changes in 2007 vs what I had on my computer. I have since upgraded to 2007.This book is very helpful for quick reminders for skills that are not used every day (like graphs). It also shows different ways to do the same thing. This is nice because not everyone thinks the same way. This way you can remember what you learned in a way that works with how you think.
5,office7 dummies,"Book is a good companion for fast reference when beginning to use Office 7, now I use it for specific problems I encounter with Office 7."
4,Just what I needed Reference Guide,"Just what I needed Reference Guide to Office 2007. I am familar with Office but since Microsoft changed it's interface, I needed something to guide me through the change. This book works very well."
2,book for dummies,I usually find these books helpful but this one seemed only to lightly cover what I wanted to learn and was not really much help. The company I bought it from was very quick in mailing and I do not blame them at all for the books content. Happy with the company but not so happy with the book
3,Office 2007 Desk Reference for Dummies.,A necessity for anyone who is only moderately adept at PC applications and usage. Easy to follow and comprehensive.
4,Just what she needed,I purchased this to go along with my wife's new laptop w/vista.She says the information is very good and she likes the writing style.I frequently see her referring to the book.I believe it is worth the investment.
3,Office 2007 for Dummies,This item has served its purpose. I provides insight about the newly release Office Suite explaining the newest features and how to effectively use them.
1,Not helpful. Not useful.,I bought this when I switched (after 20 years) from WordPerfect to Word (via Office) about a year ago. My needs were simple: basic text preparation using a new (to me) word processing program. I have yet to find a single thing that this book helped with or a single thing I've needed to learn how to do that was addressed coherently in this book. I've thrown it away.
2,"Dumber than a dummy, I guess","I spent over an hour trying to find the instructions on how to do something. Finally gave up and went back to my tried but true ""Word Perfect"" program. Just don't have the patience anymore."
3,Still the same,"The Skulls' newest album is still more of the same. While it is reccomended for their fans, the uninitiated should pick up Firme (their best album) first. Don't get me wrong, this CD is still lots of fun. My favorite track was Jive Psycho."
1,buyer beware,"This is a very poor quality duct tape. It doesn't stick to anything in any temperature, contrary to the description.I'm upset because I had to go over everything I had carefully taped a second time with another brand. Don't waste your money."
3,Flag looks good but is pretty flimsy.,The Nylon flag is fine and hanging outside but next time I will buy a better made embroidered one. This looks kind of cheap.
3,Typical Madball Hardcore,"This is pretty much the same type of music that Madball has been putting out over the past 7-8 years. It is very heavy with an aggressive style. It's ok. Although other reviewers claim that Madball is all talk, rest assured their ""in your face"" attitude is for real and comes through on this CD! Go see them live and you'll understand. Be sure to stop by the emergency room on the way home."
5,Best Madball,This is Madballs best cd yet. It has the NYHC sound with a little bit of a hip hop influence in it. I never get tired of listening to this cd.
3,Typical Madball Hardcore,"This is pretty much the same type of music that Madball has been putting out over the past 7-8 years. It is very heavy with an aggressive style. It's ok. Although others claim that Madball is all talk, rest assured their ""in your face"" attitude is for real and comes through on this CD! Go see them live and you'll understand. Be sure to stop by the emergency room on the way home."
4,Best Damn Hardcore Band Out There!,"Well, this is mostly in response to that one guy's review in which he said Madball just started off as an Agnostic Front side project...does he know anything about Madball? If this was simply a side deal for Vinnie and Roger, why would they have Roger Miret's 12 year old brother as their lead singer, when Roger, Vinnie, or anyone else who WASN'T a pre-pubecent could do it? You ever think that MAYBE this is Freddie's band? Hence why he is often refered to AS Madball? That maybe Vinnie and Roger from AF decided to help out their young friend and give him some direction seeing as he was starting out so young? Side project my ...! From day one, Madball has been Freddy's band! And so it continues to this day. Representing the best of NYHC and the DMS crew, is MADBALL. They're style and sound is relentless! Whereas so much hardcore has become predictable, or too metallic, or too poppy, MADBALL is keepin it alive and kicking, and most importantly, keepin it REAL!"
2,Madball cannot walk the walk.,"One word- posers. Madball talks so much talk in their music, but it doesnt come through in the end. They have alot of songs that are just about them being ""hardcore"". Hardcore bands don't have to say that they're Hardcore, the just are, and it comes out in the music. Madballs music sounds more like rapcore bands like Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach. In ""Hold It Down"", they make fun of hardcore bands that make money- what a bunch of hypocrites. Hardcore bands have to make money, so they can eat. I dont care what relationship they have to Agnostic Front. Dont waste your money on ""Hold It Down""."
2,DORIS DAY SPECIAL,I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED DORIS DAY MOVIES. BUT THIS DVD SPECIAL HER 1970S SHOW WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING. IT REALLY BORED ME TO DEATH. NOT WORTH MONEY SPENT.VERY DISAPPOINTING?????????????/ I EXPECTED MORE OF A DORIS DAY DVD.
3,Nice style - But somewhat disappointed,"I like the simplicity and pleasing style of this wine rack, but the 'twists' in the rack don't line up well at all, making the bottles fit on it at odd angles and don't all balance well. It serves its functional purpose, but doesn't look as 'orderly' as I'd like."
3,"Good, but.....","Lots and lots of great ethnic jewelry images - BUT they are very small, and many of the pages are laid out horizonally, making you have to keep rotating the book as you are flipping through it. I would suggest holding out for a used copy."
2,Rafaello sung in Italian?,"Quite disappointing indeed. I had another version copied from a LP, in Russian, the sound is not that good...but in Italian (????!!!!) For what!Martin Pitchon"
3,Very nice,"Her voice is too monotone, sometimes, and she doesn't take too many risks vocally but the melodies are sweet and angry. They make this album worth buying."
3,I like it,"The three star rating may seem harsh but from beginning to end, this is a smooth collection that flows easily from track to track. It's so smooth in fact that you may find yourself listening to a track you had never noticed before because there are not enough songs that stand out. ""Romantic"" is no doubt edgy and hot, ""Catch 22"" the emotional sappy song that nearly every confused woman has felt at some time and ""Childhood Drama"" drowns in pain and everyday disappointment in love. Others are pretty cool like ""Got It"", ""Too Much the Same"" and ""Salvation"", making a debut from this type of artist refreshing but a little predictable. Much props to Goapele but I hope this CD will lead into more masterpieces from her obvious talent."
5,Lyric+Music= Originality,"Goapele is a breath of fresh air among a crop of sound and look alikes out right now. Lyrics are full of imagery and emotion. Range of topics: Love, War, helping others, exceptence, and following your dreams. Please don't sleep on originality. Favorite songs: Got it, Romantic, Red White and Blues, and Things don't exist! THe Reviewer Before me said it ALL!Would like to see her, Teena Marie, Mary J Blidge, Jaguar Wright and Alicia Keys in concert all together!"
4,geopoly... geeapole... dang!!! you know who i mean!,"where most new artist have a 'voice' (viv green; heather headley) that shines best with better production, goapele offers us a 'sound'... her voice has... um... 'atmosphere'... establishes a mood between seductive and relaxed... most of the tracks here blend seamlessly, one into the next, which ends up being the only drawback to this disc... you do crave for a bit of diversity (but not until after you done wore the cd out!!! plus, that's why they make a multi-disc cd changer!!!)add this to your collection... it'll come in handy one day!"
5,You're missing out if you haven't heard this one yet...,"Goapele & her band The Heat put on a classy performance, so catch them at a live show. You will not believe her powerful, yet soothing voice. She's beautiful & graceful. It's difficult to compare her to other artists because her style is so distinct due to her diverse cultural background. If you enjoy neo-soul, hip-hop, jazz and R&B, then you'll be blown away by this young, yet very mature songstress. Her song ""Closer"" is #1 in the SF Bay Area--so if you're not already ""in the know"", get this album or call your local station to request ""Closer"". You'll be glad you did!!!"
5,A Breath of Fresh Air,"This is a really good CD. Goapele's voice is melodic. She is really talented, those Bay area artist, Mystic, Heiro and now Goapele are really putting it down. I can just put on this CD and sit back and relax. This is real music, music for your soul. I recommend that you buy two copies, one for your house and one for the car, better make that three copies, one for a friend."
2,WEAK PRODUCTION WEAK VOICE BUT GOOD LIVE,"Contrary to most reviews i would have to say her voice is very boring after 2 tracks. The production also weak and suffers from over production and to many midi generated sounds as opposed to live sounds. When i saw her live i was blown away and then when i heard the album i gave it away.Her voice really carry this music.and the music is from a composition perspective very good. It was so powerful live it is disappointing. Her voice is really hard to bear after a few tracks, it is strained and has a real poor quality. This off course doesn't mean she cant sing just unlike Sade and Holiday she doesn't have a nice timbre. owen 'alik shahadah"
3,Good but.....,She has a beautiful voice but every song sounds the same. Hopefully she will use a different writer on her second album. After the six song I couldn't listen to it any more. Sorry I bought it.
2,Didn't do it for me,"Well...I'm not trying to be negative, but this one didn't do nothing for me. Her voice is off or either it's the sounds...I can't place my finger on it, but I wouldn't say this is one that would keep your interest. If you like neo soul it's trying for that vibe, but production is off....you be the judge."
2,not convinced,"First off, Sade isn't depressing she's a genius, and it takes a little time to appreciate the work of a true artist. Please don't compare Goapele, India.Arie to Sade--please. Though they have something they don't got what she got--yet! Lauryn Hill--close--but not there yet. Closer is a sweet song, but that's about it. The rest of the record is, well ... it just sounds the same. If you're someone who digs the quasi--stirrings of India.Arie then yeah, you will like Goapele's work. It didn't engage me. I don't know what happen to R&B, N'shell N'degalo etc. is keeping the tourch burning ... Maybe I'm just getting old, and value depth in music--you tell me I'm 28--how engaged can I be with watery prose?"
5,f**kin brilliant couldnt put it down for months,"goapele sings into your very soul, the best album ive heard for years, no exhaggeration."
3,"NICE DEBUT, NICE TO LOOK AT","I was given this CD by someone that was basically stalking her and she said ""You gotta hear this girl!"" and so I did. I liked the hell outta ""Closer"", it's actually the very 1st song I can say that you can play for any occasion and it not be a bad choice. Other nice cuts are the frantic and moody ""Romantic"" - I love that cut! - and the pretty ""Butterfly Kisses"", real sweet.She looks a lot like Solange (Beyonce's lil sis). Interesting, huh? Oh, nevermind me. I go off on tangents every now and then.But the rest of the CD is so-so, but you should scoop for its other cuts mentioned. A nice addition to your collection."
3,Refreshing,"I love her voice, I think that she has so much potential. The lead single ""Closer"" is so catchy, but that is the strongest song by far on the record. I felt that there was a sameness throughout the rest of the album, and I didn't like the rap collaboration it spoilt the vibe. I really did like the messages that she conveys in her music, we need more positive artists like this to lift us out of this bling-bling, bootylicious blight that we are in."
4,Two Tracks made me a Believer,"I was 1st introduced to Goapele on Spinner.com, The song Catch 22 was playing and at 1st I was like who is that, Sade' no that can't be her then I thought is that India? But when I heard the rest of the song I was taken. I then was blessed to hear track closer ....... man that really put the stamp of approval on for me she has a really good vocal rang and here music is soothing and relaxing I would encourage anyone who is a lover of GOOD/Inspirational Music to pick this CD up. Goapele you keep doing what you doing"
5,"Don't Sleep, Won't Sleep, Can't Sleep",On this ALBUM. It's FAT from front to back. I can't say enough about it. Closer is getting mad play on the radio and the album does not let down.I never write reviews so this is really say a LOT!!!!!Don't believe me check out her whole album on her site www.goapele.comThanks for everything GOAPELE. She definitely reps from the Northern CALI!
2,Not that great-1 really good song and otherwise weak,"Unfortunately, this is one of these albums that don't live up to the advance billing. The title song 'Closer' is very good and stands out, but the rest of the album is just a lot of 'trying to be really cool' type of stuff. There is unnecessary profanity which I don't think really adds anything on this album, but I can excuse that if the music is really great, but here it is just not. Maybe her next album will be better."
2,"Just OK, trying a little too hard?","i had heard a few good things about this artist but the album is really not all that strong. the single is good, different and stands out but otherwise its just ok. some of the beats are quote tight but otherwise there is just nothing else that stands out. they seem to have been playing that single 'closer' for about 2 years now and i'm not surprised because there doesn't seem to be anything worth mentioning on the record. not worth the hassle, i think amel larrieux, rian benson maybe even yahzarah are much more interesting"
2,Unfortunately Mediocre - down with neo-soul!,"Goapele's ""Even Closer"" has every reason to be outstanding; with the artist's exotic moniker, her boho outfitting and the packaging that says: cool people listen to this. Unfortunately, beyond the experimentally smooth and subtle 1st track, the project is disappointingly average. The overall tone of the album is dark and moody and can lull you into a ""zone,"" which is fine as far as consistency is concerned. However, Gaopele's vocal range is nowhere near stunning - her phrasing and delivery remains the same on nearly every song, her lyrics smack of ""neo-soul"" posturing (see musiq) and the melodies are quite monotonous, for the most part in the same key and tempo range. The track with soulive grinding out the groove would be the silver lining, were it not for the gratuitous profanity.Stick with Amel's Bravebird for true soul, and people, let's kill this neo-soul ridiculousness."
2,I definitely expected more...,"The CD is ok but, it falls way short. Some of the songs sound the same and her voice gets very boring after a few tracks. Where's the range? My favorite tracks are, ""Romantic and Catch 22. After that, it's all down hill from there. WARNING!! Tracks 7-14 may cause a ""Deer in the Headlights"" affect."
4,Lovin it!,"I bought this CD after hearing ""Closer"" on the Radio. I was blown Away. I automatically loved the CD. My favorites are: Things Don't Exist, Romantic (w/ SOULIVE...they are wonderful), The Daze...Hell, I like the whole album. The only song that didn't tickle my fancy that much was ""Red, White, Blue"" the lyrics were good, but the song was a little boring. This is a musthave for neo-soul lovers. You wont regret it!"
5,A Jewel from The Bay Area!,"Right Now this is absolutely my favorite CD bar none! Goapele is a testiment to the fact that Big things come in small packages. This dynamic product of a Jewish mother and South African father took NYC by storm when she & her band performed at the legendary SOB club. But thanks to Amazon.com, I new way before her NY appearance that I had to own this CD. I went to Goapele.com and after my very 1st listening...I was hooked!Goapele, pronouned (GWOP-a-lay) has a unique strong delivery. In addition, if you listen to the words, you know this petite yet prepossessing young Sista has been remarkably impacted by her unique upbringing.Get this CD! I assure you that it'll be in your CD rotation for days and days to come!"
5,A rare find...,"In today's overproduced, and often copied sound Goapele is indeed a rare find. True words, thoughts, and feelings interlaced in each song her words and music truly speaks to you. Closer bringing forth a new beginning and outlook for me I gladly recommend this cd to anyone looking for rare talent, truth, and honest to goodness musical mastery. Goapele music will definitely bring you closer to the things and thoughts you hold most dare. Stop and take a minute to listen... you won't be disappointed.As always...Dream"
4,Curious...,"I just bought this, and all the swears are edited-although the disc wasn't labeled as being so...was this done by Columbia Records upon it's reissue??Anyhow, it's a pleasant disc-some tracks are dull, but never bad. If your in the mood for some nice soul singin', this is a good place to look-and the hip-hop stuff adds a lil' somethin' to the mix.Still wish mine wasn't edited, though..."
1,Not even worth it!,"THIS IS A VERY VERY BAD CD!THE MUSIC IS BORING AND SLOW, ALL OF THE SONGS ARE BORING ORIGINAL MIXES EXEPT FOR ONE BUT IT DOESN'T COUNT CUZ THAT MIX STILL SUCKS!!FORTUNATLEY I ONLY PAID 4.99 FOR THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE, BUT I STILL FEEL GUILTY CUZ IT SUCKS!YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
2,windsurfing,poor video. old school. goofy instructor with a funny accent.they should not sell this any longer. it hurts my feelings as a fellow windsurfer..cheap buy though.
2,Not that good a translation,"This version is NOT translated from the perspective of having extensive experience in Japanese swordsmanship but rather from a general martial artist perspective. Thus, many of the concepts and meanings have been misinterpreted. For the lay reader, it is adequate. For the serious practitioners of Japanese swordsmanship, it is just another loose translation."
5,Excellent Novel for Complusive Gamblers,"This novel told the truth about the world of addiction and complusive gambling. I felt as if I knew each character personally. My favorite character was Ethel. She was so funny.Great Book.To the author, keep up the good work."
4,Sympathique- Pink Martini,"I enjoyed this CD very much. The Music is great, if you're interested in hearing real musical insturment on a record, this is it.You have a bit of french, english,spanish,a bit of samba, this is musical range at its best. The leader singer China Forbes voice is refreshing,and soothing."
2,Not Great,"I have a few issues with this pillow. First, it is really expensive for a body pillow, but I figured Boppy would not steer me wrong. Like other reviewers, I feel that it is not firm enough to support the hips and I just don't find it comfortable enough to use as a neck pillow. Also, there is no cushion for supporting the belly whatsoever, so if that is what you are looking for do not buy this item.I've been sleeping with it for about 2 months now and what I have found helpful is that it prevents me from rolling on my back if I use it with the ""belly support"" on my back side."
1,Better options out there...........,"I had a hard time sleeping well even before I was pregnant ( I have Fibromyalgia), now that I'm in my 7th month it can be nearly impossible to get good sleep. I was hoping that this would help. I bought this with high hopes, but it just didn't help at all. In fact wrestling with it in the middle of the night made things worse! The cover is said to be ""super soft"" on the package- NO WAY it feels like sandpaper! I put 2 king size pillow cases over it to fix that, but then it gets even more tangled. There is nothing at all in the middle of the pillow, it's totally flat! I might as well just use two smaller pillows. It also doesn't seem nearly long enough to me, and I'm only 5'2! I'm returing this and getting one of Leachco's designs instead!"
2,Did not like it!,"I got this pillow when i was about 5 months pregnant as I could not find any comfortable position to sleep in, i was so excited to get this after ordering it on amazon, but what a disappointment! it barely had any padding inside, and it would flatten with a simple touch. I am 5'5 and weight about 145 back then, and by no means was I THAT big that the pillow would just flatten between my legs. I ended up just using king size pillows which did the job better than this, i think this was a waste and the shape kind of sucks too. They could totally improve the shape and padding on this."
2,Flat after a couple weeks :(,"I wouldn't say that I'm a larger gal, but after only a few weeks, I could half this pillow into a standard pillowcase! It was great at first for my 5'4"" frame, but I may be going back to my old body pillow now. Not really worth the price."
2,Miserable,"After much research and reading lots of reviews, I settled on this pillow. I am not a side sleeper and was hoping that this would help make things more comfortable not sleeping on my back during pregnancy. This pillow probably wouldn't be so bad if I was willing to evict my husband from the bed. The pillow is bulky and awkward. The different sections get tangled in the sheets and twisted around. Every time I change positions or get up to use the bathroom, it's another round of wrestling. Generally, the pillow ends up on the floor. I would not recommend."
5,Very helpful product,"I bought this for my wife. She had been having trouble getting comfortable. With the Boppy, she could rest easy. It was worth every penny. It is LARGE. Probably actually longer than my wife, that's alright though. My wife is very short. It works as a pillow, belly support, and between the knees support; everything she needed!"
4,A very enjoyable book,"A very enjoyable book about love, romance, family and self-esteem. This book kept me interested from beginning to end. It's a little spicy in some spots, so not for those 18 or younger,but other than that I think any one else who like sweet romances will enjoy it."
4,Key of Sea,the Key of the Sea was a nice read and easy to follow between flights. Characters were warm and endearing.
1,There are so many better books out there!!,I have bought many parenting books & found the information in this book somewhat limited & not very informative. There are plenty of other good parenting books which go into better detail than this one!
5,Durable and Doesn't Smell,"I have this silicon ice cube tray with heart shapes and I love it. It's really durable. I don't have the problem other reviewers mention with getting the cubes out, and I like the fact that the tray isn't (or hasn't yet) cracked like every other plastic tray I've used in my life. And I feel confident that I can get it clean when I wash it with regular dishwashing liquid - something I never really felt with plastic and metal trays. And the ice does not smell or taste funny, like I've read in reviews for other silicon ice cube trays."
4,Cute little heart ice cubes!,I bought this item a while ago. It makes perfect little heart ice cubes. Easy to pop out of tray.
5,hurray!,"Finally, an ice tray I don't have to struggle to get ice out of! you can take out one cube or all...and they are cute little hearts! you just push them out. no ice all over the kitchen. no asking someone with stronger arms and hands to ""pop"" the tray for you. {Something most of my family refuses to do for me anyways} and it is small enough to fit almost anywhere in my freezer. I will be buying more."
4,Great for storing earrings!,"I only gave it four stars because I don't use it to make ice- I bought this to store my earrings in. I keep it in my drawer and put one or two pairs of earrings or a necklace in each heart. Its really cute and works great for my purpose, but has nothing to do with making ice :)"
2,not that great,they're maybe cute and fun but it's hard to push and i don't recommend it all. buy one of those regular ice cube trays!
5,cute and fun,Loved serving drinks with these heart shaped ice cubes. They are small and dainty. Easy to remove from tray.
4,Non-Silicone Ice Cube Tray,"If this tray is made out of silicone, it isn't the normal, heat resistant stuff that my potholders are made of, because the packaging contains warnings that you should not put anything hot on or near it. Other than that, it seems to be of a good quality, be just as pictured on the internet, and work better than traditional plastic trays for ice cubes. I am a little disappointed that because it isn't heat resistant it cannot double as a jell-o mold or candy mold, but there is a reason that they sell things specifically for molding candy and other hot substances."
3,Not dishwasher safe,These made cute jello shapes for Valentines day.But take the product description seriously - these are NOT dishwasher safe. One trip through the dishwasher has left the molds distorted and out of shape.
5,wonderful,"quick delivery, and i love my heart ice tray - apparently everyone else does too! very nice and i'll order again!"
1,What Junk!,This toy is made of the absolute cheapest material imaginable. Whatever they put into their hamburgers is filet mignon compared to the materials used for this toy.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,DO YOU WANT YOUR KID TO EAT MCDONALDS ALL THE TIME AND END UP UNHYEALTHY? DO NOT BUY THIS TOY.
4,Only $14.00,"Just wanted to say that everyone is right about the durability of the McDonalds toy but you get what you pay for. If it was a Little Tikes or Step 2, etc. then we could complain. Right now it is on Clearance at Target for $14.00 so I feel it was worth it. I got it for my 4 year old son who has no sisters so he doesn't have any types of these toys to cook & serve with. Also my older boys got into it with him. It's all about the fun, RIGHT?"
2,Good concept but wouldn't recommend,My boys love to play with this but it hasn't had ANY doors on since the first week they had it. I put the doors on daily and they are off within 5 minutes. I've contacted the company quite a few times and have yt to get a response. VERY DISAPPOINTING!
2,No fries with that shake!!,"I bought this item for my Grandson, he had to have it.Within the first week the Drive-Thru was closed, finished & broken. I'm totally surprised McDonalds would put its name on such a cheaply built toy. I have returned the item & returned to Little Tykes where I know my Grandson will not be disappointed."
1,What I wish I had not bought my daughter for Christmas,"This toy is horrible!!! My daughter has not even played with it yet and it is already broken. One of the pegs that holds the whole toy together broke while my husband was assembling it. I would not spend my money on this toy. It is a really great concept and I'm sure that it would be fun (if my daughter had the chance to play with it). The plastic is SO cheap and flimsy. I expected this toy to be of better quality because it was $ and we have bought toys for less that were of better quality. For all those parents considering purchasing this toy, I want to tell you that the quality is not worth the price. Go for Fisher Price or Little Tykes, they are worth the money."
4,Hours of Pretend Fun!!!!,"The only thing my daughter wanted for christmas was this toy. I could not find it anywhere. Then i read all the bad reviews on here, so I was kinda glad. Well, my daughter and I went shopping yesterday and we found a whole shelf full of these at Target for $30 so i bought it. She was so excited. It was pretty hard to put together and the plastic is not real durable, but other that that SHE LOVES IT!!!! The drive thru doors have opened fine everytime she pushes the button, and believe me she pushed it a million times. She cooked and served all of us for hours last night! So, over all this toy is not as sturdy as I would like, but it was worth the money, and teaches communication skills."
5,love this,I added two more placew settings to my set. I just love this set and I always get compliments on it. No silver polishing. Dishwasher safe.
1,An Unsatistified Customer and have been trying to return for my credit and have emailed 4 times with NO reply...,"The product is not what it looks like on the advertisement and I thought that it was the complete set and not few pieces, they are soooooooo light weighted and I would like to return and my refund as I have been requesting. PLEASE and Thanks"
5,Great,"Everything included in this bundle are great, high quality products. You will not regret this, and for the price, what have you got to lose?I've been using the Gold Class Wax for over a year now with amazing results. The interior Quik Detailer works magic, and the Gold Class Wash is great. The only negative is that the High Endurance Gloss did not last as long as advertised. They say ""Lasts weeks, not days,"" but it in fact only lasted a few days."
5,"Good stuff, works great","I use this on my M3 and the car looks clean. The kit was complete, I bought another kit with this from Meguirs and it has everything I need so I didnt have to keep going back and forth to the car store to buy things.Very good price as well. I use the bundle for all my cars"
3,Great Price Bad Packing,This was a great deal. I just bought a new truck and was so excited to clean it up. When my package arrived the bottles had been damaged. Love Amazon just poor packing.
1,Coded Wrong Does not fit Subaru Outback,The product selection said this fit a 2010 Subaru Outback and it is not even close to the right filter.
5,Worked Great,"Replaced Water pump on 1999 Cadillac Seville. You will need the removal/installation tool and a 1/2 inch breaker bar as it takes a lot of torque to remove the old pump. It is the reverse of normal- clockwise to remove and counter clockwise to install the new one. Install O-ring (included) in groove before before installing the pump, a little silicone grease on the o-ring will keep it in place and prevent it from turning. I ordered the rubber cover gasket and Leslie tool at the same time from Amazon and they all worked perfectly. Watch videos on youtube. DO NOT USE AN IMPACT WRENCH it will break the housing!"
1,US should be ashamed,"Bosch has always been associated with quality German engineering. Much to my disappointment this product was made in China. If this product was made in the U.S., I would have gladly paid double for it however, I refuse to hollow out United States jobs."
1,Inordinate amount of time to ship by BooKnackrh,Sold by: BooKnackrhIf you see this seller Sold by: BooKnackrh drop it and go buy it somewhere else. I ordered it on 12/8/10 and here we are 3 weeks later and it has yet to ship.
2,"I used to like it. Now, ugh.","I got this CD for free, and I only listened to it a handful of times. ""Mouth,"" which was its first single, was catchy and sorta fun at the time, but now it's so beat-me-over-the-head silly that I just despise the thing.Avoid this album. ""Mouth"" is the best song on it, and that's not praise."
5,Wife loved it!,"My wife received this as a gift for Christmas and she has been touched by this book. She couldn't stop raving about it! We have a close friend's baby shower coming up, she bought this immediately for her friend. I guess it's a worthwhile buy!"
2,Think before acting,This was a very easy read. I really like the fact it was in the Detroit area in which i know very well. It had a lot of type errors. It was good and I could see her Breaking Point. Good Point.
5,"BUY IT, BUY IT, READ IT!","If you want a good story that stays on track, keeps your interest and is straight to the point, then this is the book. Janaya takes the reader direct to the subject matter-the abusive, drugged-out, traumatized world of Marion Hayes. In this character the reader will find a bit of herself in some components of Marion. Sister, caretaker, confused, sensitive and striving to survive when the odds seem stacked against her.The great thing about this book is that in 153 pages the author succeeded in telling a complete, simple story. From start to finish you continually capture the characters origin to her demise. It does not take you off into boring tangents or convoluted mixes of characters connected to other characters and so forth. You can read this book in one day straight -granted you can get a day alone without any disturbances.This is an excellent short story and well worth the read"
5,You go girl!,I could not put the book down. The Breaking Point pulled me in and I could stop reading it until the very end.Adra YoungAuthor of: The Everyday Living of Children & Teens Monologues
1,"Horrid, twee, syrupy pop!","If ya like bad George Michael imitations, this 'un is for you. Overly slick, over produced fodder for kids who think N'Sync is too challenging."
3,Not needed,"My 5 year old APC UPS stopped being 'seen' by my PC and I had hoped that the problem was that the original cable was the problem. Unfortunately it has to be with the unit itself since this new cable did not (re)establish the connection. Although this cable did not ultimately fix the issue I was experiencing it is a high quality item for a fraction of the price APC wanted for the same thing,"
5,"Works Great, Great Service","Thanks this is the perfect cable I needed to bring my old APC 1500 back-ups back to life! Quick shipment, too!"
1,What??? This must be a typo. Lol,"I think this man has an amazing voice and although I'm in the states, you can buy an imported audio CD for the same price as if I walked into a store here.They are asking $118 for one CD? You've got to be kidding me.Steve, MAKE YOUR MUSIC MORE AVAILABLE. We love ya!~ (Not for $118 bucks tho. That's a little too much love)"
2,Disappointing,"After hearing Balsamo's duet's with Mario Frangoulis, I had to buy this CD. What a disappointment. No memorable songs -- most written by Balsamo. Great voice -- but overshadowed by a bad sound editor and the orchestrations overpowered his amazing voice. Pieces like ""Dedication"" need to be his mainstay."
4,Its ok but creates a lot of dust if you use to much,The product smells good.It works but prefer the manufactures recommend solution ESSICK (no dust)If you put to much in the container it creates a ton of dust. The essick wick filters when using this product show a build up of Golden solution in crystal form. However they remain clean from mold/bacteria.The ingredients are not mixed well and don't stay in solution
4,Effective and Easy Way to Purchase Products...,"Exactly what I ordered. Came before the estimated due date. Would recommend to anyone looking to purchase similar products. This time I ordered, there was a limited number of units I wanted to purchase. Had to buy another size as well."
1,Unhealthy,"I bought this along with a large humidifier. I was concerned about the bacteria and minerals in my water. I live in an area with extremely hard water. But about ten minutes after I put this chemical in the humidifier water, I started to get a headache and my husband started complaining of a sore throat. It made my house smell like a public pool (it smelled like chlorine). And after I read the warning labels on the back, I decided to just throw it out. It has warnings about not getting it on your skin or eyes and not breathing it. How are you supposed to not breathe it if you put it in your humidifier? It even had warnings about making sure the cap was on tight when you stored the bottle to prevent fumes from escaping. With that many warnings, I decided it was safer to throw out the chemicals and just clean my humidifier more often."
1,Not what I expected,"Nowhere on the description did I see that this was a collection of still photographs, without narration. I was hoping for a documentary, something to refresh my memory of visits to the park. Very disappointed."
5,Even at 66 I have been deeply helped to mature,I worked through this book in Jan of 2008 at age 65. It has been very effective in helping overcome deep abuse issues I experienced as a child; many still affecting my adult life. I'm only sorry I did this at 65 not 20 years sooner. But I am a much better man who has trully overcome some painfull stuff. My thanks to Tim and to our Lord Jesus for the inner healing I have experienced. Finally Rom. 12:1-2 is for real!
5,recommend it,"We just started this course. We are on Unit 5. It is very good, gives you things to think about growing up and gives Biblical Scripture to memorize and remind you of who you are in Christ. Each week is divided into 5 day studies. Goes over so much of coming from a dysfunctional family. I thought my family was normal, but honestly I don't think any are. Not unless they are totally committed to Christ. May you be blessed and encourged. I got my sister one and we are doing it together at our own pace and reviewing it long distance via the phone. Amazing how many things you see from another perspective. Very helpful. The group I am doing with locally, one of the persons has done this study several times and each time the Lord reveals more. Enjoy and be healed!"
5,Great insight into dysfunctional family life,"This author is right on target. Although I read through the Bible first and God healed me through his word, Tim Sledge beautifully and methodically walks you through the process of biblical/psychological healing of wounds from a dysfunctinal family life. A wonderful tool to give a needy friend or relative or to guide you in helping others."
3,Good enough but old,Quite outdated but hardly paid any money for it and it's a great starting point for having a list to work with.
2,Why doesn't it come in dvd,"I would like to buy this but will not buy in in VHS form when will it come out in DVD,must be very old stock! Will not buy"
2,Knock off blades?,These don't seem nearly as sharp as the Remington blades you can get at any store. If I had to guess I'd say they are refurbished re-sharpened blades. They don't feel smooth like new blades at all. Maybe I got a bad batch but I wouldn't buy this again. I'd rather spend twice as much on sharp blades.
4,Good phone for the price!,"I bought this phone because of the price and the dual handsets. I spend a good deal of time on the phone and I am very pleased with the battery life. I am not sure if the other reviewer maybe had a faulty phone because my handset that isn't plugged into the phone jack works great and I have it on the opposite end of my house. I also don't have any echo's or buzzing noises in my background. I can spend at least four hours on one phone without the battery dropping any notches, so I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for good battery life."
4,"Sinister, Taboo & Downright Erotic!","Walt Curtis turns 'gay writing' on its head with this sexual raid upon the senses. This poetic tome leaves the reader wondering if Curtis is mad, gifted or damned. Rare insight into the imaginative genius of cult literature's pagan god"
1,Don't Buy This Hunk O' Junk!,"We received one as a Christmas present, and liked it at first--back when it was working. Only 5 months later, we began having having trouble getting it to charge and keep a charge. Now, almost 7 months later, it has a loud hum on either channel and the handset almost won't hold a charge at all. We are shopping for a new, decent phone."
5,Great phone,I bought this phone for my daughter who has a cochlear implant and she can hear quite well using it. The reason we chose VTech is our past experience with a VTech phone and that is it analog which is better for people who have a cochlear implant.
1,BAD BUY!!,"I wonder if i'm getting deaf but I can hardly hear the other person on this phone! Secondly, if I walk more that 10 steps away from the base it starts getting distorted and by the 15th step I get disconnected. I regret buying this phone."
2,You get what you pay for !!!,"We also received this phone as a christmas present and own it for almost a year. It was working fine at first,a few weeks after getting used to it and all the wonderful beeping noise, the first handset collapsed. It keeps telling me the other unit is on which it is not! I tried everything v-tech suggested with no positive result.At least we still had one handset left which I was able to take out in my yard(for 4 month) now I can barly make it to the kitchen (approximately 12 feet) without loud backround noise and constant beeping. It is irritating and frustrating that you are requiered to sit next to the base in order to have a decent understanding and completely annihilate's the purpose of a cordless phone !V-tech offers to repair it for a fee but I don't want to spend any money on a product I don't believe in. So save your's and spend it on a hopefully better product ! GOOD LUCK !!!"
2,Vtech Phone,The phone work great and was very inexpensive. There is some sound quality issues but not bad. Also some of the features are not intuitive.Good bang for your buck but do not expect the greatest phone.I will keep mine.
3,"Consumer Reports ""Best Buy""","I have not purchased this phone, but was considering it after reading that Consumer Reports rated this phone their ""Best Buy.""I am re-considering after reading the previous review, as the owner had his phone for 6+ months, prob. much longer than CR tested it.Here's what Consumer Reports had to say...It gave it 71/100 points.HighsExcellent voice quality when talking and listening. Good phone ease of use and reasonable 7-hour talk time. Shouldn't cause interference to other wireless products. Phone has lighted keypad, any-key answer, voice-mail indicator, and multilingual menus.LowsLike most analog phones, its range is shorter than most, it can't conference cordless handsets with an outside call, and it's susceptible to interference from other wireless products, such as LANs, baby monitors, and other phones. Handset lacks auto talk.Bottom LineA CR Best Buy. This analog phone offers fine performance and features at a low price."
3,I expected better quality,"I chose this cordless phone because it was recommneded in the ""consumer reports"" as being the best sound phone, but it was the same as the others I've had: it starts loosing quality when I walk 20 feet away from the base, with noise interfering in the conversation, and if I'm closer to the base, I can hear a ""beep"" from the light pulsating in the base.Sorry to say, it's the same old medium-quality reception, can't compare to the plugged-into-the-wall models."
1,Vtech is 0 for 2,"My husband and I bought two of these phones, based on the positive reviews in Consumer Reports. One phone has an echo--you hear yourself echo when you're on a call--and the other phone is static-y. I tried all the trouble shooting steps, including trying various chanels and different locations for the base. Nothing helped. V-tech has a ridiculous 30 day return policy. My experience with the costomer service line was beyond frustrating--from the horrible and inaccurate menu to the customer service agents who are not able to adequately communicate with the callers beyond the scripted situations they are trained for. They offered to replace the two phones for me with the same model, but given that two out of two phones have issues, I think that any other phone they sent would have problems, too."
2,Ate the Battery,"The title says it all. While it could have the batteries fault, I can't go on buying these incredibly expensive batteries to find out. Back to Uniden."
3,Could have been better.......,"To start things off, I'm not a huge punk/ska fan. So a lot of the material on this album doesn't really appeal to me. I'll admit, the Goldfinger cover of ""Rio"" is pretty dope, but other than that, the others are just average...........except for one exceptional cover by one exceptional band. This cover would be ""The Chauffer"" by none other than the Deftones. This song sticks out like a sore thumb on this album. Here we have a bunch of happy punk/ska bands, and then you have this dark, moody masterpiece by the Deftones. In my opinon, the Deftones cover of ""The Chauffer"" is a good enough reason alone to buy this album. However, if you want another tribute album with a better variety of musical styles on it, check out the Depeche Mode tribute album. The Deftones also have a track on that album, doing an excellent cover ""To Have and To Hold""."
1,Didn't No One Tell You?,"I'm a real die hard fan of Duran Duran and I welcome any good tribute albums that may come along (after all, DD had their own tribute album with ""Thank You""!) but if you have any taste in music whatsoever, you will leave this plastic waste alone. I was on the edge of buying the C.D, but after a quick taster of the tracks, I was disgusted. None of the songs had the same spirit as the originals and most of the songs are sung by punk bands that sing the track out of synch and at double speed! I agree remakes should be crafted into the style of the band remaking the tracks, but they should be done with passion, experience and commitment at least (Take ""White Lines"" by DD!) I was really let down by the great songs on offer, ruined without consideration for real DD fans like myself. They don't even sound like the originals!I wish it was good, but it wasn't. Thank You!"
3,Decent Tribute,"While this album is slightly better than the awful Operation Ivy tribute album, I still see nothing special here. Most of the ska bands are too radio friendly for me to get into, and most of the punk bands just aren't that great. THe best cover on the album is River Fenix's (now FenixTx) cover of Ordinary World."
5,Not my cup of tea but..,"This cd was not for me, but a gift for my best friend..it made him happy so I am happy!!!"
4,Enjoyable,"It's actually pretty simple. The songs speak for themselves. Anyone who won't admit Duran Duran being one of the greatest pop bands ever and recognizing Simon's talent for melody writing has to reconsider the overall parameters with which one judges. Even the bands that conceptualised this tribute album, which they did for an exact reason, didn't come close to style and beauty with their own songs compared to DD.Pier"
2,This stuff smells like straight up cooch!!,"I got this stuff off of Amazon. I was excited bc I had just gotten this really cool skull straightner and I wanted to see my hair looking really good, but sadly I was disappointed. It was too heavy and it made my hair look greasy. My hair is really thick and I have a lot so Idk how in the world it made my hair like that, but no that wasn't the end. This stuff smelled SUPER FREAKIN DISGUSTING like straight up dirty VAG! I would definitely not recommend this product."
4,This Ink Cartridge Has Worked Well For Me!,"I almost always order my ink cartridges from Amazon and am very pleased to report a 100% successful record of intact shipments. The last ink I ordered arrived in perfect condition and was fresh with a use-by date around a year ahead.We have two HP printers which use different inks so it seems I'm frequently ordering replacement ink cartridges.In only one instance have I ordered ink which came from an Amazon seller that was soon to expire; I complained, received approval to return and exchange the ink and a replacement came in that was fresh with an expiration date that was months away.I really have no complaints about the service that I have generally received from either Amazon or one of Amazon's sellers. The ink has always done its job perfectly! I expect to continue to buy my ink from or through Amazon."
1,Expired Ink,"I bought this ink at a good price, too good as it turns out. When I received the printer ink, it was not in the original box. It was still sealed in the plastic, just not in the original box. The packing slip stated that ""This ink is expired but should still work in your device."" Well, it didn't work. The expiration date on the ink is from 2004 and the printer recognizes that and won't use it.If I had known that this is what they were going to send, I would have bought more expensive ink that actually works."
2,Advice to a Young Wife from an Old Mistress,This was a book we selected for our book club. It is written from one woman's experiences & the experiences turned into advice. Only one person in the club thought this was a great story. Most of us thought it not worth reading. How can you have one affair & then write a book of advice?
2,The Wehrmacht,"Not quite as interesting as I expected, but a good history of the German army and the anti-semitc attitude of most of them."
1,Horrible,"The software will not stay up on my new Win2k laptop. Zoom in on the map and it crashes. Pan the map east or west and it crashes. Acquire a satellite and have it plot your current position on the map, and you can see where you are for about 2 seconds before, you guessed it, the map software crashes.Rand McNally's web site is useless for technical issues/upgrades.Complete POS. Going back to the store tomorrow.Putting your company's name on a product this poor is an easy way to ruin a well-known name brand in record time."
1,big disappointment,"Well, I was looking for a low cost GPS for pc system and I came across this product ( I was going to buy it and try it out ). I happened to read the comments and was really shocked how bad the product was. I just wonder what in the world is wrong with the vendors ( this includes Amazon ). Do you not test the products that you are going to sell? Not to mention that Navman and RM are careless enough to let this ruin their reputation, the vendors are to blame here to. Is there anybody else beside Navman that makes this for pc? Thanks for all of your good reviews."
2,Not the best,"Unlike other reviewers we have had no problem using the receiver with other software. I have always liked Teletype software and it works with this receiver.As for the RM software, it is pretty good at finding and sorting points of interest in towns that we visit. Worthless for routing as mentioned before you need an internet connection."
4,Not bad.,"I guess it was rushed to market. So it is not perfect,But works pretty well if you spend some time.When I got it, I had to download the driver for it to work withWindows XP. The StreetFinder Deluxe is pretty good, it has Several working mode. Kids mode for kids to have fun. EZview will give you the most important that you want to know when driving a car.You can record your route and play it back later, using 1-20x the original speed. You can also set a route to track.Pros:USB interface, so it does not need batteryPretty accurate. Almost always show my position in the right road. (except in certain urban area, where it will make minor mistakes)Also works with MS streets and trips.The mount is cool.Cons:The software (StreetFinder Deluxe) is not very stable, after running for 1 or 2 hours, it responds slowly.I guess it also works with Street Atlas, which might solve the problem."
2,"Reliable mechanism, but not durable","I've gone through quite a supply of breakaway collars for my cats, so I've had a chance to practically evaluate several major brands, this one included. This collar features a broad ovoid tab as the latching mechanism, and it's just hands above the snap latches on other collars. Unfortunately, the reflective material, which to me is as much a safety requirement at a reliable latch, quickly faded and the adhesive holding the reflective fabric fails, rendering the nice and otherwise durable collar ineffective within a few months. When new, the reflective material was easily bright enough to spot a kitty in the dark at a 100 yards with a single bulb AA LED flashlight, so no problem being visible in car headlights. Without the same reflective material, the cat is invisible under the same conditions. The snug latch releases easily when torqued from the side as it would when caught on a passing object or brush. This would be a 5 star review if the product were durable."
3,Good for true beginners,"I bought this dictionary before going to Japan, but I now find it to be too basic. There are lots of entries on different verb forms, so if you don't know the plain form it can be very helpful. But as you get better, you'll probably find that there aren't enough sophisticated words. Good for looking up colloquial words, but not a good choice for anyone but beginner level."
3,Not Enough Words!!,I lived in Japan for 5 years and bought this to help teach Japanese students English (to look up words they had a problem understanding) - Very frequently it did not have the words I was looking for - ended up buying a different dictionary - there are others out there!
4,Martin's Concise Japanese Dictionary,This dictionary is more like a travelers guide. It would be great for someone that is planning to go to Japan.
4,Thank you,Received item in timely fashion and we are pleased with it. It was in good shape for a used book. Thank you!
4,Good Purchase,"All of the foriegn exchanges students are buying this book and as a parent, I have heard this is the best one out there so far."
2,Not very good,"Often (too often), the musical numbers seem clunky and awkward. While I'm sure it's heart is the right place, some songs seem ridiculously banal and artificial. For example, ""Talk to Her"" & ""It's Time"" sounds like an adult trying to recapture childhood--and failing. I think this is an prime example of over-production. Some songs survive; they don't fall into this trap, like ""Stars"" and ""Stop, Time"" both of which I found actually moving, in a ""You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown"" kinda way. Too bad the rest of the musical didn't do anything for me."
5,It's a great show but the vocal score is-WOW!,"I haven't actually listened to the album but i was in ""Big"" at a local theatre so i know all the music. the music is great, i wish i was alive when this great show was on Broadway, but then i wouldn't have been able to experience ""Big"" as a kid. its a great album, it makes you feel great about life."
3,Big for folks doing the Musical,"If you're getting this CD to help prepare for your school or community group doing the musical, there are a lot of changes from the CD to the book. Aside from finding the book in a new key and some chunks added/deleted, Here We Go Again and When You're Big aren't included anymore.Overall, the music's a little trite, but there are some nice moments -- mostly the stuff sung by the female leads."
4,The first show I ever saw.,"The first Broadway show I ever saw was BIG. I was ten . I've seen over thirty in the following seven years. Obviously I was hooked after seeing BIG. The music is not the greatest, the cast is not the best. But Maltby and Shire work increidbly well together. This show is a masterpiece for children and teens. A big fan of the movie, this show was a perfect musical adaptation. My favorite song: Dancing all the Time. The show is cute in every way. Although some songs still needed some work, the show is fun in all aspects."
3,"Cute, but should stay in High Schools...","This musical is cute. Thats about the best word I can use to describe it. There are moments where the lyrics are a little funny. Then it will try to be deep, and it just doesn't gel. The voices are alright, but none stand out as amazing. Likewise, no songs are really catchy and keep your interest very well. I imagine this as a high school production, and not sure how it even got to Broadway. I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a show to do (unless its for young people), or to listen to unless are a very young listener. Collectors of course should get this, but thats it. New and old Broadway fans will dislike this equally.You'll notice that even though the review is pretty negative, I still give it three stars. Well, it isn't bad as some others are, it's just blah. Favorite Song: ""It's Time"""
4,didn't work for rehearsals,"I used this CD to help me rehearse for the BIG production I was in, but it didn't match the libretto at all. I think there was one song on there that I could use."
2,an endangered place,"Rather than focusing on an animal, this focuses on a region and its people. It shows how a woody area is being wiped out in Ecuador.This focuses on human interest or self-interest. Many people could care less about biodiversity, but they care about their pockets and health. The work says the lumberjacks won't have anything left to cut if they do so this rapidly. It mentions that a culture would die, but I wish it had said more about language extinction and exactly how customs disappear. The disappearance of this wet area may have effects on people's far away. An important note: they say this forest is where we have found many pharmaceuticals. We may be wiping out our chance of better medicines.I wish this had spoken about what the Ecuadorean government is doing on this matter. This had diverse interviewees showing women and men, the scholarly and the uneducated, North Americans and South Americans.It kinda made me want to go on an ecotour as well."
4,Out of print..,"Just a note, this trade is pretty hard to find at the moment, as it is out of print. Volumes 1, 3, 4, and 5 are all in print. I bet you're thinking ""Hrm, thats weird."" It is weird! But that's Marvel for you. Expect a long wait on this unless Marvel figures out what they're doing."
1,Do NOT Buy,This is MY review that is being sold without my permission. I have contacted a lawyer and will be prosecuting.
5,Perfect,"I was looking for a fun wine rack. Something small that can hold more than a couple bottles. I absolutely love this wine rack. It matches my kitchen fantastically and it holds more than enough wine. The only negative thing I can say is that it is best to have the up against a wall or something because when it is full, it gets top heavy. But, most wine bottles are all different sizes so you have to place them in the rack so that the weight is distributed more evenly. Other than that, I love it, it does exactly what I needed it to do. :)"
1,beware of charlatans,don't waste your money on this book or others like it or 'new' america maps. what kind of people make money on what should be available to the public to protect themselve$?
1,Waste of TIME!,"Complete rubbish, nothing you've not heard before. Much of the book's dates have passed to no avail. I hope the author's got their cash and ran while they could! Only buy this if interested in researching bad prophets"
4,Interesting book in more then one way,"When I picked up this book I did not know what to expect, perhaps a mystery book, well I did not get a real mystery but nevertheless I got a good book, so as already mentioned elsewhere, if you are mystery freak this is not for you, if you are a neutral person this is definitely good read. What I also found interesting in this book, is the picture of how in the last 60 or so years the ""correctness"" - referring to the treatment of minorities etc. by police - have changed, that is if the author is to be trusted with the description of the real life back in the late 30s."
4,"Good, not great","Like at least one other reviewer below, I read this book following the GLOWING review it got in Esquire last summer from Greil Marcus. I must say, it disappointed me following all that buildup. It is most definitely NOT a light summer plotboiler. Rather, the plot serves primarily for the author to expound, mostly through the pages of White's journals, on the themes of beauty, memory and loss. I also expected a dramatic, and more expansive denouement, based on the Esquire review. Instead, the author just drops a few last clues that cause you to re-examine conclusions you have been coming to in your own mind in the concluding page or two. Lots to chew on, if you are so inclined, but I'd save it for a chilly early winter evening in front of the fire, rather than taking it to the beach with you over Labor Day."
1,Deceived by an Edgar Award,"I was looking for a mystery or thriller. Instead I got a philosophy lecture. If I had wanted philosophy, I certainly would not have gone to the Edgar Awards. I'm sorry I didn't read the reviews before I ordered the book - then I would never had oerdered it. SHAME on the Mystery Writers of America!"
2,Only for those people obsessed with Marshall,"Whoever that guy was who wrote the other review wasnt paying attention, or else he was just messing around because this is just an interview, which is quite obvious. Its not too entertaining, kinda boring. Unless you just cant live without your eminem. I think he is a good emcee, but i also believe he is a lot more image now than he is emcee. His first cd ""infinite"" to me represents the real eminem. It was underground, but it definetly wouldnt have made a wave in the mainstream market. Today though eminem seems to be on of the driving forces in the hiphops takeover, and i cant fault him for that. All im saying is check out infinite, and you be the judge. Long live hiphop........when im seventy im gonna still be rocking some Outkast.........hehe.......lata yall"
2,One serious improvement needed.,"I bought this vacuum for my wife as a gift. I was quickly impressed with it's powerful suction and all the attachments. We have wood floors in our kitchen and several area rugs and this machine looked like just the right tool. There was just one problem. When you hook all the tubes together to make a long stick vac the only way it attaches to the vacuum is by snugging it inside the end. This becomes problematic with the weight of the attachment. It fell out over and over while vacuuming the rugs. Black and Decker could have easily solved this by making it a secured attachment on the end of the vacuum, click into place if you will. Without it it just keeps falling out rendering it useless. My wife suggested using two hands, one on the unit and one on the tube but that is hard on the back. A decent product with one major flaw. Since this was the primary use I returned it."
3,Decalcium Humidifier Clean,"Instruction is not very clear. It says ""Use plastic brush to apply"", but it does not work that way. You must immerse whole unit with this chemical for a couple of hours to get a good result. Calcium deposit/scale is very tough to remove. I used almost one third of the bottle for cleaning one humidifier. I need to repeat it regularly."
2,Steve Murray's DVD: Cancer Guided Imagery Program for Chemo,"Very basic and general introduction to Guided Imagery. Other than mentioning the words ""chemotherapy"" this DVD does little in the way of targeting chemotherapy treatment, which is a dissapointment, given the title.Rick BornSan Rafael, CA"
2,Not for professionals,"This book is fine, probably even very good, for those who wish to proof their own day-to-day business correspondence. However, the treatment of proofing symbols is limited, and the sample markings deviate somewhat from accepted professional practice. More of a first intro to some of the very basic things to look for when proofreading. No discussion of the bookmaking process or what editors expect of a professional proofreader."
1,Plain and Simply Boring,"Plain and Simply Boring - Not as helpful as other proofreading books I've read, but at least it's short and quick to read through."
4,This is a good song.,"I used to think this was the best Limp Bizkit song until I heard ""Boiler"". This is still a very good song though...No F-words in this one! (gasp!)Anyways, a great song. Jump up and down to this one."
4,Buit IT,"Hi, the best cd of the word is it the best band is limp bizkit and the best song and single is my way Buit this CD Thanks BYE"
3,baddaboom!,"shipping was quick and everything.it's just the hat looks a little weird on me.other then that it fits. i got a ""L"" head.(8^D)>-<"
3,Good Product but short battery life,"I purchased this watch closed to 2 years, this product is running very well just like its brand name, however, the battery already die on me and the replacement is so expensive."
1,"Wow, was this bad!","I usually enjoy writing reviews for the products I buy here at Amazon, because for the most part I enjoy the various purchases. Having said that, this DVD was the single most, hands down, bar none, worst product I have purchased anywhere. There are no manatees, not much science connected to lionfish, the worst narration, and the quality of the DVD was horrible. In short the only reason I gave this product one star is becauce I couldn't give it less. Kudos to the distributer they got the product out in a timely manner (wait was this a good thing?). The video is inexpensive but save the couple of bucks and invest in any other natural history or science video."
5,Slammin beats and jammin rhymes,"I want to get the skeleton holding the basketball tattooed on my calf. Haven't done it yet though. I really like this album. That color green, It's just beautiful."
5,OUTSTANDING!,My husband and I love these headphones. We workout and do yard work with these headphones on and never have a problem. They are great for traveling because they fold up and easy to put in a carry-on bag.
3,"hardware works fine, software......thats another story","Pros:compact unit, i like the car kiti had no problem setting it up with my Palm m130GPS was very accurate, acquiring took about 10-15 seconds, not bad at all, after that, it only acquired after losing the signal, which wasn't very often.Cons:the software! really awful when it comes to giving driving directions. for instance, it told me ways to go which were either impossible (like driving over water!), or using local streets when highways were more appropriate. too bad mapquest can't work with this. looking up the directions on the internet seems to be an unneccesary step, since the maps are already on the CD! highways that wind and curve were a problem, since it couldnt follow that accurately, and said 'off route'. also, a better piece of sotware would help with the refresh rate on the palm, which is ok if you dont load a big map (<100k) it's really a shame, since a better piece of software would make this useful"
1,Don't Buy this at any price,The software often picks route 100's of miles out of the way for no reason. You cannot pick your own route at all. The Navman 12v connector is VERY weak. Mine broke within a few days. The GPS pulls the Palm's battery down in no time at all - 2 or 3 hours. Navman's web site states the 12v cord powers the Palm too - not so according to their tech support. I have recently purchased a Magellan gold handheld GPS that works great. I can even drive Delorme software on the Palm from the Magellan. DON'T BUY THIS THING!
1,Great disapontment,"I figured that for this price the improvements would be huge, but no. What did they do besides the new look of the interface, some new filters and including HDV? Rendering time is still really slow, they relly screwed up the Adobe Titler, trimimg or cutting large files takes really long and loading and saving takes forever. I've been using Premiere since version 6.0 and I thought that by now Premiere would be competing in the same plane as Final Cut. I just upgraded from Premiere Pro 1.5 and it was worthless."
2,Premiere Pro 2 - good but not good enough,"I bought Premiere Pro 2 just before discovering Avid Liquid 7 which works much better and faster, has more features and is very easy to learn.I was extremely disappointed that Prem Pro 2 does not write dual-layer DVDs. I knew this when I bought it but it still should be able to write DL discs. Dual-layer isn't such a new technology that Premiere can't include it. Rendering is still slow as with previous versions even though preview is realtime or close to realtime. Premiere still does not seem to take advantage of today's extremely fast graphics processors included on most video cards. Avid Liquid 7 uses the graphics processor instead of the CPU for much of the rendering. Avid Liquid 7 previews realtime and also renders extremely quickly compared to Premiere Pro 2. The difference is night and day.All in all, I wish I had not purchased Premiere Pro 2. It's a good product but it's not good enough when compared to Avid Liquid 7."
3,not King Crimson,"not enough experimentation or musical variety here . I love King Crimson ( which is Robert Fripp , after all ) but too much of Mr Fripp's solo stuff is a bit safe . This is gentle , melodic and drifting music , with almost no Fripp-style lead guitar ."
4,More of the Brilliantly Beautiful Same,"The funny thing about ambient, new age and any type of soundscape music is that some of the best complimentary remarks one can make would sound like insults were one speaking of any other genre. ""This sounds like background music."" ""I can't remember which song is which "" and ""This music makes me sleep."" I can apply all these comments to Fripp's soundscape albums. But I love them because they are beautiful. I love that they lack cloying melodies and lyrics that would distract as I read or work on my pc, and when I allow the cd to lull me to sleep, it is an unbelievably soothing and restful and peaceful doze into which I drift.i am glad that I found music that fulfills a specific purpose -- and that the purpose is to achieve restful, peace of body and mind... wow, that's a tremendous thing.I consider some of Eno's and most of Budd's work in this genre to be the 5 star stuff."
4,Fripp's Spiritual Side,"I've heard about 6 or 7 Frippertronic albums dating back to Let the Power Fall. This is the best. The music is very smooth and rich, something that can not always be said for this style of music. The different churches that the tracks are recorded at also seem to add their own ambience.This CD is not for everyone, but if you like Frippertronics, this is a good addition to your library."
1,bad cotton candy,This Cotton candy is not sour at all. Also it made me sick. Some of the cotton candy was all clumped together and hard and not cotton like. Do not buy this product.
1,Outdated!,"This book illustrates basic exercises with very little real information. Arnold shows his bodybuilding routine which consists of training each bodypart three times per week twice a day, which would be extreme overtraining for anyone who is not taking steroids. His dietary recommendations are outdated and primitive. This book is satisfactory for learning basic exercises so long as you disregard the training advice."
3,GOOD BUT NOT THAT MOTIVATING,"This is a good book to start boybuilding.But the book's doesn't provide good pictures and photos to show the results of bodybuilding.The pictures all show pretty normal developed people except JON JON PARK who is more musucular than the average man.Last of all,the chapter on competition bodybuilding is too short and brief.The training and excerises are all condensed in a few poor pages where those are the photos people really want for an ARNOLD book."
2,disappointment,"This arrived with a broken screw fitting, it is not white, more a cream color, even the Lasko trademark is pealing off-and it is not as quiet as I expected."
2,high setting did not work,I got this fan for my son and the highest setting did not work at all but other then that it was ok.
4,Good for the price,Good fan that moves a lot of air and is pretty quiet. If it starts to get a little noisy you can tighten the parts or readjust it and it's quiet for the rest of the night.
4,Great little fan for the price,"I've had several of Lasko fans and have them scattered throughout the house. For the price you can't beat it. Three speeds, quiet enough for me and I even put a couple near the dog beds and they love the cool breeze. For $20, a great deal and my other ones have lasted years and easy to clean and disassemble."
3,"Not the best, Not the worst.","The fan is cheaply made, cheap plastic, flimsy blade, very flimsy everything. Well it didn't take long before the first problem occurred, not even a few hours into running an extremely annoying CLICKING sound as it rotates, and there is nothing you can do about it, I took it apart, checked for lose screws, nothing.Also this fan is extremely loud just by itself. If you have a hard time sleeping with background noise, dont get this fan, it sounds like a jet engine flying through your room.Overall, this fan does move air well, but it is loud, flimsy, and poorly made."
4,works well,"This fan works well and produces a decent amount of air for my kids bedroom- although that is with it sitting about 2 feet away from them and oscillating. The only minor issue is that the fan is made of all plastic and doesn't seem to be able to tolerate too much abuse (dropping on the floor, etc)- which my kids sometimes do to things. Overall, pretty happy."
1,Lasko makes terrible fans,"I was given a Lasko fan for my birthday. My fan quit working entirely on the 4th day, where it was only in use for 3 hours each day. To put it in perspective my older fan which are 3 years old are still working, this one couldn't cut it for 3 days. You may think this fan is relatively cheap, but if it stops working after 3 days that $25 isn't so cheap anymore. Lasko is horrible!"
2,12 inch oscillating table fan way too loud!!,"I bought this fan because some of the reviews said it was quiet. If you have any trouble sleeping and noise makes it worse, it is very difficult to find a fan quiet enough not to disturb you. I can never use any fan unless it's on low, but I couldn't even use this one on that setting. I gave it to my daughter in return for an old fan I had given her, that was much more quiet."
1,Missing a piece,"The fan is very lightly built, all plastic and comes in kit form, and ours arrived with a critical piece missing."
4,Looks cheap but has lasted,"I think this looks cheaply made. But since I am using it in a storage room, it really doesn't matter. It has lasted 2 years without any problem and has been running 12 hours a day that entire time. It is a good inexpensive fan, but I'm not sure I would recommend it for style. Although I'm not a fan of white. And if you are, you may feel differently."
2,Lousy fan,"This is a lousy fan. I've used it only on the highest setting. It feels like a gentle breeze, even if you're 5 inches away from it. I'm returning it. Do not buy if you're looking for something to actually to cool you down."
2,Bad controls,"The photo of this fan is very deceiving, as the vertical post is actually shorterthan shown and when the fan is pointed down, you have a heck of a time gettingyour fingers under the fan shroud to turn the controls.I have found this to be more than enough, to buy another brand in the future.Get your act together Lasko; If you want to take over the fan world, you should putsome effort in the ergonomics."
5,Great fan - very powerful,Very quiet - great fan for augmenting air conditioning during the hot summer nights. We used this when our air conditioning went out and it was a welcome relief. we ended up still using it throughout the very hot summer months. it is pretty strong so you don't want to use it in a tiny room but was perfect for the mid size bedroom we have.
2,"Lasko 12"" oscillating table fan, not so hot","This is a cheaply made fan. The plastic molding is imprecise. As a consequence pieces don't snap together as cleanly as they should. The fan is nosier than other desk fans I have, but it does also move more air than quieter models. As another reviewer pointed out the vertical distance from the fan guard to the base is shorter than depicted. Therefore, it is difficult to reach the knob to change the fan speed. The inability to tilt the fan up and down decreases the fan's usefulness. I will definitely not buy another fan from this manufacturer."
5,NO BOOKMARK NEEDED,You won't be able to put it down. I opened it after work on a Thursday and read until 4 a.m. Good thing I was off on Friday. It's written so well the pages turn themselves. One particular chapter--you can find it yourself--was one of the most compelling I have ever read. This book now ranks along with Grisham's The Firm as the best I have ever read. The difference is that this story is true! I would have given it six stars!
3,Of regional interest,"I picked up this book because I am from the Upper Peninsula and knew a couple of people involved in the story.Overall, the plot is very interesting and keeps the reader interested. The descriptions are accurate as well.The writing itself was rather choppy and seemed to be unedited. There were a lot of grammatical errors and repetitive sentences that often distracted me from the story. If you can ignore that, it's a good book."
4,Excellent Read,"Like a few of the other readers, I too found this book difficult to put down. I am a ""genuine yooper"" having been born and raised in Marquette County. I do know, personally, many of the characters portrayed in the novel. The descriptions of the Upper Peninsula are accurate. Knowing from firsthand experience however, I did find a few inaccuracies which may be distracting, for those of us from the area; one example of which the information at the beginning of the book referring to the central location of the story ""Anatomy of a Murder"" as being located in the Michigamme. (Should be Big Bay, Marquette, and Ishpeming) There are many other publisher errors in words etc. Overall it was an excellent read."
2,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"I bought ""Hunt to Kill"" a couple of years ago after seeing this case on Court TV.I thought ""The Sweater Letter"" would be a different take on the story.Little did I know that it was the same identical book. What a waste of money."
5,PAGE TURNER,"This book is so engrossing! it will keep your nose buried up until the last page...this is one writer who does his homework! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Just don't have plans for the day when you start it, because you won't be able to put it down!"
1,The Sweater Letter,"I live in the very small town where this mrder took place, Ontonagon. I did not find this book enjoyable, but rather overrated. I found the cover picture crude and cold. A body laying on the snow, lined up in a gunsite. This book has caused the family much pain, and it is dredged up continually. The release of this book was in our local paper at Christmas. How horrible it must have been for Judys child, parents and siblings. They have to relive this tragedy daily. The fact is, its very disturbing this author is making money at this familys expense. I guess all that matters is how well it sells. You may enjoy the books about murders, but when you live, and work in the community involved you cannot imagine the impact this book has. I cannot recommend this book, let Judy rest in peace."
3,tigerbill concepts of tension free drumming hand technique volume 1,Well let me say that i never had a video of how to learn to play drums without tension until now wow he goes into detail about using one hand drumming and many more
4,Insightful,"Tigerbill has meticulously explained and demonstrated drumming hand techniques on this DVD. The information is invaluable and the video footage enables you to critically compare your own technique to Tigerbill's. The DVD is so detailed in fact, that I would not recommend sitting down and watching it from beginning to end. For those of us who are not blessed with perfect technique, the DVD is most beneficial by biting off small chunks of the material and mastering each stage bit by bit. The DVD format is much like having Tigebill in the same room. However, some of the content I found a little cheesy and the production is definitely not up to the standard of the Hudson Music DVD catalogue. Nevertheless, this product is a great buy for the beginning drummer and anyone wishing to perfect their technique."
2,Product not as described,I use a lot of patches for .22 caliber up to 12 gauge...and lots inbetween.I buy big patches and cut them down as needed for other calibers.THESE ARE NOT 100% COTTON...they say cotton and my contain some cotton but they are the synthetic material patches.I'll still use them but will go back to buying my own bulk cotton flanel from the fabric store and cuttin my own.Very misleading.
4,They cant be stopped,This is another great release from the florida death metal quartet.I own every deicide album.This is not their best but is still great.Bible basher is a great cut.Believe it or not this album is their slowest!If you want their other stuff check out the self titled album or serpents of the light.
1,new deicide is a major disappointment,this was a favorite band of mine at one point but once upon the cross and thereafter deicide became this cheesy death metal band. insineratehymn is worse then serpents. the guitar riffs r not technical at all and they've slowed down a lot. i don't mind that part but the slow riffs didn't take much thinking thru. i was once a true deicide fan but i'm not sure if that spark is there anymore since they can't seem to put out new material that is worth the waiting for.
2,another crappy album,"anything after Once Upon the Cross is crap, I have no clue to how one of death metal bands that I grew up listening to could put out a album like Serpents of the Light and this."
1,I've Heard This Before,"I get it already. Glenn Benton doesn't like Christians. He covered that topic on EVERY other Deicide album. I have listened to them all and I own three, Deicide, Legions, and When Satan Lives. I found them all to have a familiar sound and Insineratehymn isn't much different. They may have recorded the album in the same studio as the first, but it isn't as good. I don't really like any of the other Deicide albums and I only bought the ones I have because a friend said they were insanely awesome. Maybe I should leave the reviewing to true Deicide fans, but just because Glen Benton can talk about Satan doesn't mean he is evil, just look at wussy Marylin Manson (who can actually sing better!)"
2,satan must be CRINGING!!!,"I cannot believe how much Deicide has deteriated over the years...Maybe it was just my age but the first 3 records did succeed with their overstated and ultra-contrived shock value ""evil"" routine. This record is slower and you can understand most of the lyrics now.This is not a good thing!! I am embarrassed to admit I once took this band seriously...I feel truely ashamed and would suggest the Deicide boyz contact satan immediately and get him to do something about this mess.Deicide is to satan as Stryper is to god...both in their heyday laughed all the way to the bank.I guess the joke was on me, Deicide is a silly ,silly band."
1,Stale bread has more life in it than this album...,"Dissapointing at best. Seriously uninspired, and poorly writen lyrics mesh perfectly with rehashed riffs to make this album one hell of a snooze-fest. Maybe the boys in Decide have become a little over medicated? As a fan, and veteran of many Decide shows, I have to say that if they cant pull off anything better than this they need to hang up their christian-hating hats."
4,NOT THEIR BEST BUT THEIR HEAVIEST!,"This album took awhile to actually grow on me. However, it was well worth the wait. Deicide are death metal masters and this album shows it. They keep the speed and brutality yet they also add a new heaviness to the songs (as seen on Serpants of the Light). The CD opens with Bible Basher which just grabs you by the throat and tears it in half. The other key tracks on this album are Standing in the Flames, Apocalyptic Fear, and the classic Worst Enemy. Worst Enemy has one of the heaviest evil riffs of all time (second only to Father Baker's). I definatley recommend this to any Deicide fan and fan of any death metal. Satan will rule his world!"
3,Not so bad...3 1/2 stars...,"I actually enjoyed listening to this album, but I was a bit disappoited too. The songs are very much like the songs in serpents of the light, and this is probably their weakest album, and the lyrics aren't so creative. But they still play great music, and if you're a big deicide fan, I'm sure you'll love this album..."
1,Worst DEICIDE album ever unfortunately,"Man, this is just horrible! I was expecting so much more from DEICIDE. Steve's drumming has hit an all time low. This album sounds very uninspired to me. I love DEICIDE, but this one was extremely dissapointing. I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone. I hope they get back on the right path as DEICIDE were just not meant to be a slow band!"
1,Boring.,"How many times will fans buy the same album, Deicide is ripping you off. Write one album, change the lyrics and song titles and poof you have Deicide's whole catalog."
1,"Deicide have gotten old, fat and slow","It is not a pleasure to report the demise of the band, but bitterness has taken over. Where once they took pleasure in a good attack and creation of an expressively violent song, now the formula and ""known working song devices"" are the law. This is a satire of their earlier works. Get the first three albums long before you ever venture near this listless, mindless, broken and bitter album."
1,am i being sarcastic???*,"i love this album!!! when i listen to it i feel so dirty!!! I really scared my parents when i tattoed an inverted cross on my forehead and sacrificed our dog for the love of the bornless one!!! This is music by true americans who are certainly blessed with musical talent. jimmy page, yngwie malmsteen, toni iommi, and adrian smith and dave murray cant hold a candle to these satanic rockers. And dont get me started on the lyrics. i frequently allude to them in my essays that i write in school!!!HAIL SATAN guys!!!*you bet your arses i am i suggest deicide just fullfil their destiny and commit suicide so they wont have to plague the music world furhter with their incompetency and mock evilness"
3,"Not bad, but not entirely dishwasher safe","I used these for making penguin-shaped chocolates, they worked great!However, although they say dishwasher safe, make sure they are on the upper rack. I accidentally washed it on the lower rack, and it was too close to the heating element and melted.There was a Fred brand ice mold next to it which held up fine, since the Fred ones are more heat-resistant - you can put Fred ones in the oven - but not these!I'd rate it higher if it hadn't melted in the dishwasher after the first time I used it."
4,good product,"as with any ice cube mold, if you dont fill it right, it comes out crappy. too much and they come out with extra ice on the sides and too little and they come out as headless penguins. good product though and material makes it very easy to extract ice cubes without ruining them"
3,"Not as nice as my previous penguin ice cube tray, but acceptable.","This tray is nice, however, the details on the penguins are not very defined and end up looking like a little round ball with a peak, but they still work fine."
4,Simple and straightforward,This was a gift for a friend who loves penguins.Not too many people make ice cubes the 'old fashioned' way with ice makers and whatnot now but it's definitely more for a cute and nostalgic use than to make mass ice cubes.I've read some reviews about not putting it in the dishwasher or intense heat but just wash and drip dry.
2,"Cute shape, weird material","I liked this initially, but after keeping it in my freezer for a few weeks, the bottom got really slimy. I think something in the silicone might have started degrading somehow. It was pretty gross to think about what might have been going into my ice cubes, so I threw it away. I wouldn't recommend this."
3,Decent,It's a nice change-up from a normal ice cube tray. Not very efficient though. Takes the whole tray to chill a glass of mine (about 2 normal glasses). Next tray I'll just be buying a normal one.
4,penquin ice cube tray,"Cute idea that I had sent along with the penguin tea timer, in case the recipient wanted iced tea. What could be cuter than penguin shaped cubes in an iced tea??? Great product (wish I could say the same for the tea timer, though)"
3,It's an ice cube tray,"It's the yin to an ice cube trays yang, hard to get the water in without spilling but very easy to get the cubes out. Maybe one day science can cross breed a super ice cube tray. Until then the engineers need to put some channels between the cube chambers to allow water to flow better."
2,PenguinTray - Iced,"Any one that's use to an IceMaker will find this a challenge! Took almost 3 weeks to get enough ice to fill an ice bucket, as I was not use to dumping ice. Would only remember on the average, one tme daily. The penguins are about the size of a mini cube and nine to a tray...Get the picture!"
2,"Decent, but a PITA","The cursor movements are slightly jumpy and erratic. Replacing the batteries was frustrating, as the latch to open it frequently was jammed and difficult to open. I ended up replacing it simply for that alone."
2,Not for non Arabic speakers,"Although my family and I are not Arabic speakers, we live in the middle east, and wanted to get something cute to help my toddler work on her Arabic skills and expand her vocabulary. But the animations are too abstract and do not engage her enough so she loses attention quickly. Such a shame. If your child has more developed Arabic skills or is a native speaker, this might work for you. Since I teach in a bilingual (Arabic/English ) classroom, my counterpart can use it so hopefully it wasn't a complete waste of money."
3,Good for under 3 year olds,Cute rhymes and catchy songs. My child got bored of it and never watched it more then twice. He loves the Sesame Street DVDs more.
2,No concept; tough reading,"When you are familiar with all of the details of the Irish War you might be able to find this book valuable. To this day I have been unable to determine what the author's intention was when he wrote this book. It cannot be considered a history of the Irish War and the sub-title ""The Hidden conflict between the IRA and British Intelligence"" is totally misleading. The author rushes through history like a fast train that stops only at a few, yet insignificant locations. At times he concentrates on personal observations that have not much to do with what was written before or after. There is no concept or structure in this book and that makes this work a very tough reading."
3,Another book from a professional TEACHER,"Richard Walter is, once again, very good at rehashing other people's ideas, whether it's from screenwriters he's talked to, reading the trades, or hanging out with other screenwriting professors. What he can't and doesn't do is bring his own insight and talent to the job, because he's not a screenwriter, producer or agent. This book is no worse than some other books written for absolute beginners, but you can learn more specifics and tricks of the trade by reading books by actual pro's."
2,Screenwriting by Richard Walter,Not very useful as I wanted more set-up information. Good advice on agents.I recommend Screenwriting for Dummies purchase instead.
5,'Been using it for YEARS!,"I really have been using the Bonne Bell Gel Bronzer (I preferExtra Dark) for AT LEAST 20 years. Now, that might sound sad, but it is a wonderful product, very easy to control, does not cause clogged pores, etc., washes off easily, does not rub-off on clothes, etc., and stays on all day. If you are not tanned, it gives you a realistic glow. If you are tanned, it deepens it without looking ""fake"" or cakey. It also gives a nice little lift to forearms, chest, etc.. I can no longer find it in stores and so glad that I found it and am able to order on-line through Amazon.com!"
5,True Blue,"I've used this product for years and keep a constant supply. It gives your face a tan coloring without being heavy or unbelievable. It blends right in. I'm fair complected and although I go to the tanning salon, I don't tan my face to avoid wrinkles. This product adds color to my face to balance out the tan to the rest of my body. This gel blends easily and effortlessly."
4,Something new,"I bought this album based on the outstanding quality of ORINCCO FLOW by The Taliesin Orchestra. I am not a fan of Winston's music, but took a chance with this album solely based upon Taliesin Orchestra. You cannot compare this music to their ORINCCO FLOW album. This music is meant to be descriptive of visual scenes...much as Richard Rogers was in his famous Victory at Sea albums. This is an album of full-bodied and robust music. On the other hand, if you are a Winston fan, you may feel some of this music afronts the artist. But it is good orchestral music meant to support a visual image."
3,Aikido Self-Defense - Demonstrated,Aikido Self-Defense has good visuals but it is a demonstration type of presentation with very little verbal information. There are no intructionsto help understand the details; But it is not promoted as an intructional presentation. For those who have a knowledge of Aikido vocabulary & form the demonstration may be useful. This may be helpful for me when I learn & know more about Martial Arts.
5,I agree that it is one of the best,I found the video on Aikido Self Defense with Toshishiro Obata great. I also liked his Samurai Aikijujtsu video and book. It's hard to find this type information on video or books.
4,Kathy and the Doll Buggy,"I was so EXCITED to find this book! I had it when I was a little girl in the 60's. I bought it for my grandaughter who is now 3 1/2. The only bad thing, which was most likely my fault, was that it didn't have a jacket. But, probably in my excitement of finding it, I didn't notice that the ad probably said it had no jacket. (I'm pretty sure the picture showed it with the cover, as it does on this page.) My daughter and my grandaughter were so surprised when the little one opened it on Christmas Eve!!"
1,...10 STARS IF IT WERE INSTRUMENTAL,"these albums should be released with the instrumental tracks!!as hard as i try, i just can't get into these type of raps over this type of music. the raps are totally random. in my opinion, the music is totally spoiled.then again, it's my opinion.good lookin & lookin good need to re-release these and other jams as instrumentals."
5,excelente opcion,"es un gran libro de latin!!!, contiene los ritmos mas importantes de este genero cada uno de tres formas con la banda completa,con la seccion de percusiones y play along. los ejercicios de slap estan geniales .contiene tablatura y notacion normal.altamente recomendable no solo como libro de slap sino tambien de latin!!!!"
3,A Really good reference!!,"This is a very well contructed book, and it shows the evolution of the slap technique in the Latin Style and also demostrated once and again how well is Oscar Stangaro as a teacher, writter and bass player. Like we say in my language !!!BRAVO!!!Heriberto Rojas"
5,Wonderful (and not too scary!) book for all to enjoy,"My twins (almost 5 years old) absolutely love this book. They are shark-fanatics, and the cautionary tale of the main character teaches a valuable lesson as well as entertains with delightful illustrations and story line. Mom and Dad thoroughly enjoy this book as well!"
1,Dont Buy this one,"I'll be precise while giving you guys a review for Mr. Wolfwood, if you are willing to buy this, then get it out of the box as soon as it arrives and put it on the display (it's another thing that it may broke). This is not the one I will recommend to play with or it will not be a great idea to get one either."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I purchased this item as NEW from Amazon, and when I recieved it, the ear pads had worn away from what looks like 6 years of time. I called JVC customer support, and they said it would cost 14 more dollars for replacement ear pads, and 7 more dollars for shipping in 3 weeks. How convienient that they are the only people to have the replacement items, yet sell this exact product on this site. If you're going to buy something like this, get it in-store. I will NOT be ordering from Amazon.com again!"
4,Arthur Court Horse Salt-and-Pepper,"This is a really beautiful piece, but is much smaller than I expected. The shakers are about as big around as a dime and the shaker holes are the same for both pieces."
1,Return it,I bought this item yesterday and will be running directly back to the store to return it today. What a joke. These speakers have very little volume much less quality of sound. What you're paying for here is a docking charger not a speaker system. This product is just another rip-off for the American consumer to waste money on. My search for good portable iPod speakers will continue.
3,only average,"I received this speaker dock for Christmas, and if it wasn't a gift from my husband, I'd probably return it (and go get the JBL OnStage that I asked for!). As compared to your average radio the sound is comparable, but it doesn't hold a candle to some of other speaker systems available. The sound quality is, as the title indicates, average at best. The volume control is adequate, but there is NO bass to speak of."
5,New Transit Direction,The New Transit Direction and Wonderful Defense Mechanisms -- their music is amazing. One of my favorite bands and albums. Definately worth a listen.
3,"Pretty pictures, but not much helpful advice","This book has hundreds of very impressive photos of specific items, noting their defects, markings, and value. However, unless you happened to run across the exact same item, the information is next to useless. While it is interesting to see an unusual art deco lamp, I'd be more interested in meatier topics, such as (1) how prevalent is art deco?; how hard to find?; (2) what should you be looking for in an art deco piece?; (3) what are the trends? Is this passe? Up-and-coming? Likewise depression glass, Shaker furniture, Americana, and old toys. Instead of a pretty coffee table book, I'd appreciate the value of the author's experienced guidance much more"
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this recording based upon another Amazon review that was very misleading. There's NONE of the Zimmer magic. I've since read that almost all of the score was actually penned by Gregson-Williams . . . and, I believe it!"
2,Too much irrelavancy,"One-third of this book describes the parts with pictures while the same was done in two pages with diagrams of the names of the parts. It is difficult to understand why so many pages were devoted to describe these parts. The book was edited by a family member and ""self-published"" by the same family. Result: the pages come out in pieces after first reading due to poor quality of binding. The book contains information and photographs about the author's family and has ""Featured Advertizers."" I was surprised and felt pity by considering what I got at such a high price for the book."
2,Overpriced,"This book would be overpriced at half of the $69 it cost. If you remove the advertisements, the self-promotion and definitions (which are good), there is only a third of the book devoted to repair and then only cleaning, etc. Another failing is no table of contents or index to locate specfics."
3,Good Watch Repair Learning Book,"The book is not well written but it is obvious that the author knows watches. It would be helpful if the images were color and they had different examples of the pictures instead of just one. Also, the books aproach to explaining the terminology is good, but I would have like to have a more lamen's explanation of the parts."
2,Not what I was looking for,This is a little log book for folks who fish the ocean. Was looking for something to log my flyfishing trips and this ain't it.
4,late shipment,"great recording, just what i was looking for, except i ordered through 2 day shipment and i had to wait more than a week to receive it... bad shipping."
