5,Best choose I've made for my dog!,"When my wireless dog fence came in the mail, I was very pleased that it arrived on time. The product also came in great shape no dameage whats so ever. I even got it at an incredible price! It was easy to install, and the next day my dog was already trained to stay in his boundries."
5,Easy and Works Great!,We have a Jack Russell and just moved into a new house. The wireless dog fence was easy to set up (plug in and set up the flags) and it works great. We have a fairly flat yard so we didn't run into any issues.
2,Inconsistent results,"The item works well sometimes but the dog will also pass through the zone regardless of the electrical stimulation. Hesitant to boost the shock to the max. Maybe she needs more training, but I've already spent some time doing that."
3,Mixed Review,"We discovered after several hours of frustration that the neighbor's underground wireless fence interferes with this wireless fence's signal. There was no warning given in the instructions or online instructions regarding this interference issue. I am also not sure about the reliability of the collars charge as it has shocked me while removing the collar from my dog. I doubt that I would purchase this item again as it is not that effective for our dog, as soon as she runs through it, the shock wears off it 30 seconds and my dog continues to pursue the other animal or enticement that caused it to go through the boundary."
2,Difficult to find perimeter - scares dogs to death !,"I did not have a good experience with this product. The perimeter varies from day to day it seems. I did try to use it a few times and after being shocked at the LOWEST level, all three of my dogs just sit down and shiver when I even put the collars on."
1,Inconsistent & unreliable boundary,"After 2 hours of trying to set up the unit and establish the boundary, we gave up. We would get the collar to beep at a one location, then go back to the same location and it wouldn't beep. We changed the position of the transmitter, changed the battery in the collar, reset the transmitter - all futile. We even had the transmitter sitting out in the middle of the driveway (no cars around) with direct line-of-site to the collar and it was not consistently able to beep at the boundary. No way I would trust this for my dog's safety, not to mention confusing the heck out of her. And to top it off, I bought it from a place (not here on Amazon) that is going to charge me a 20% restocking fee."
2,"Not reliable, nor good for large space","The maximum setting was not significant enough for us. We have a 3 car garage & large driveway that winds in front of our porch. With the maximum setting, most of the ""allowed"" area was taken by that area. Once she got to the grass, she probably had 30' of space. That's just not enough for her to run.Also, when working with her, the system failed to beep in all areas. I couldn't tell if the wavelength was blocked by something, but I didn't trust it as being reliable. After 3 months, we've decided to go with an inground invisible fence for only double the price, but much more worth it."
1,Wireless Junk,Couldn't get the system to work correctly. Had to return it and spend $1300 for a professional install. Plugged it in and it would never connect with the receiver.
4,"Does what it says, with some issues.","We bought the PetSafe for our beagle mix and it has worked for her. The boundary lines are not consistent, but she quickly figured out how far she could go and stays clear of the flags. The only negative we have seen is that some areas are good one moment and then bad at a later time, but the main area she is allowed in work. We are using it at full range and it gives her a generous area to run in.Overall, it is a good value for money and setup is simple."
4,Zap-and they return,"Worked on my Jack Russell, but the collar is for large dogs. Since the device is recommended down to 15 lbs, there should be a smaller collar option. But the versatility and the transportability are great. I was surprised by how light the device was.PIF-300 Wireless Dog Fence"
1,More than a pain in the neck,"We purchased this product about this time last year. While it was easy to install and our two Jack Russell's were easy to train it hasn't been a resolution to keeping the dogs close. Several issues are the batteries have a very short life and cost a lot (1-2 months at $9.95 for 2) In the last few months it doesn't seem matter if the batteries work or not. They run right through the boundary and don't think anything of it. The collars start beeping, but the dogs just keep on going. Six months ago they would have slide to a stop, but now it seems to make no difference. Lastly, a must do is remove the collar if here's a storm. Our youngest pup got a zap sitting in my lap during a storm and ended up with a red mark on his neck. As another reviewer mentioned, collars are to big and bulky for dogs under 15 lbs."
2,works great...if you have a flat yard.,"We used to have one of these exact systems 5 years ago and it worked WONDERFULLY & perfectly...However, our yard was 100% flat there. Since then we have built a home and our yard is 100% NOT flat...UGH. And this will not work in our yard due to that very reason. Very sporadic, unpredictable if you don't have a flat yard. BUT, if your yard is flat, works like a charm! Highly recommend for those instances."
1,Wireless petsafe,BEWARE!!! Doesn't work with wireless routers in your house. The collars will go of everytime your pet gets within 30 feet of your computer. BEWARE!
2,Does not work,"This product seemed to work at first, but eventually my dog started ignoring the beep and the shock. She would still wander outside the boundaries and not pay any attention to it even though it was supposedly shocking her. Also, at other times, I noticed that it didnt beep or shock her at all when she was way outside the boundaries. This product did not work for me as it was advertised."
3,Not Sure yet,"I seems to work fine, but i did notice that the other day i was hanging out with my dog, well within the 90 foot radius. and the thing started beeping which scared my dog to run towards the unit to avoid being shocked.. i felt that my dog was like one of those prisoner with a collar around it neck that would exploded if she didn't run close to the house"
3,Did not work at my house!,"While the system seems like a great option, I could not get it to work to save my life!! We finally figured out it is inconsistent if your home is elevated at all. We are in a hilly area, which may explain it. I can't say how it would work if our home was on a flat lot, so my review is purely based on the fact that we have some elevation in our yard. Bottom line, if you are not on a completely flat lot, be aware it may not work! I give it 3 stars for the very courteous customer service, otherwise the product itself is a 1 for our home."
1,Great idea -- but it didn't work for us (alas!),"The invisible fence ""line"" did not seem to be accurate -- working in some areas, but not in others. This may be because the area we were using is not a clean-cut, even square (or even a circle). But, no matter where we moved the monitor, it was the same result: working in some places but not in others. Thus, we couldn't trust it to contain our dog. We had to return it, but I want to add that returning it was easy, cheap and fast. While the containment didn't work, we were pleased by the instructions that allowed us to easily return it and our refund showed up on our next statement. Thank you."
4,PetSafe Wireless Pet Fence,"I was having a huge issue w/my dogs trying to dig out of the back yd but I did not want to go through the trouble of stringing out the wire and it only seemed like a temporary fix. In short, the petsafe wireless fence solved all my issues! I was able to put the collar on a low setting and adjust the electic barrier to exactly where I needed it to me. Within about 2 months, my dogs stopped digging. The only negative point regarding this product is the batteries have a very short life and are around 10 bucks for 2. Otherwise, the product is mobile so it's as simple as unplugging it and moving it to the next spot. Excellent product."
1,Don't waste the money!,This is not a very good product. The boundary area kept changing without us moving any setting. Sometimes my poor dog would get shocked 5 feet from the front door. Other times he could leave our very large yard and never get shocked at all. We followed all directions and it just did not work well for us. So glad Amazon makes returns so easy.
2,Very difficult to set up,"I had high hopes for this one but was disappointed. First off you have to locate the unit in a place that doesn't fall below freezing. That means in the house. The controller is big and ugly about 12"" cubed and you should hang it on the wall about 24"" off the ground. Looks really nice in the living or dining room. Secondly, if you own a car or two or have steel overhead garage doors, forget it. The controlled area has a huge dead spot where the signal is shielded by the metal cars and door. Thirdly the boundary area is very inconsistent. One time Rover gets zapped right at the flag and next time he's 20 feet past the flag before getting shocked. How does a dumb dog learn where the boundary is when it is changing all the time?Conclusion: Pony up the $1500 for the Invisible Fence brand underground containment system and be done with it."
5,Great,This product is great. My dog has been getting out of the fence and takes off when the front door. With this product I don't have to worry if he runs out the front door.
4,very simple and effective!,my dog learned her barrier in two shocks with this thing...and 1 day...now she's free to roam a descent area and safe from the traffic!keep extra Batts on hand...works just fine!
3,Like it but...company stinks!,I like the system but the company is horrible to deal with. I installed the system at the end of July and have had a few broken parts on the collar so far. Whe i called the company they just kept saying it was my fault and not the cheap design of the collar that caused the pieces to break off of it. Everytime i would call it somehow was my fault...very bad to deal with. Basically unit works well but the collar is cheaply made and has broken 3 times in 3 months and of course it's all my fault.
2,It kind of works...sometimes,"We have had this system for quite a while and it started off great, over time the transmitter died and we had to get a replacement, now they collars don't work! We have 2 dogs and one of the collars is extremely sensitive and won't the let dog move far from the transmitter and the other can go where ever he wants! The batteries are new btw. I just went to call the dogs inside and had to search for one of them until I finally found him wayyyyy outside his range! We will be using this system for quick trips with the dogs to my parents house, but will still need to watch them. We are upgrading to the dogwatch underground system."
1,Pet Safe Wireless Pet Containment System,"This product was not easy to install. We live in the country and had walk all around our property holding the collar. It was very hard to see the light, especially in the daytime and you could barely hear the little tiny beep. This product was very inconsistant. There were areas where it would work and some places it would not. We returned it."
1,Does not work w/ rectangular yard w/ close neighbors,"We tried PetSafe as a cheaper alternative to putting up a wooden fence. However, our backyard is a rectangle with neighbors close by on either side. To give our dog full access to our backyard, the system also gave full access to the neighbors' yards. When we lowered the setting to keep the dog out of the neighbors', then she only had access to a small portion of our yard.Furthermore, we only plugged in the unit to test the boundaries. Everything else was unused. We've tried repeatedly to contact Promax to return this item and have received no response from them at all. I will never buy anything from this company again."
1,Only effective for level lots...,"I had problems using this product. My lot is slightly sloped, so after reading the other reviews, I purchased the product. This only worked on the completely level side of my yard. On the sloped side, the dog ran right past the zoned area. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Not sure if it was just defective, but make sure you have a completely level lot before purchasing this product."
3,Pet Safe,"This product is a great idea, but it didn't work well at our home. The boundary of the frequency seemed to move back and forth instead of remaining in one place. Also the consistency of the frequency was irregular. Sometimes my dog could go through the boundary with no problems (due to lack of frequency), but yet not go through the same spot at another time. It was confusing for him. We decided to go with the in-ground system and it has eliminated the problems we had with the wireless system."
4,Great Product,I have had this for a month and it works great for my Jack Russell who loves to run everywhere. He learned very quickly how far he could go. Much better than putting in a new fence.
1,Just doesn't work in suburbia,"We have a3/4 acre lot, which is large for a subdivision, but this fence just doesn't cut it for us. Because you can't adjust the shape of the transmission we can't place it anywhere in our house that keeps the dog in our yard only, and still allows him to run in the area that we allow him in. Not only that, but once it gives out the warning beeps you have to move in 20 feet (not an exageration) for it to stop beeping...our dog is a beagle jack russel mix, and he just wouldn't understand how far he'd have to move in to get it to stop. Finally, we were not getting a consistant signal...if we couldn't figure out the barrier, chances are our little mutt wouldn't either ;-). Very disappointed in this product that got so many good reviews."
1,"Does not work, not recommended","I followed all directions, but one side of my house will not work. I have moved the unit. I have turned the unit and I have reset the unit. My dog can walk right between my neighbors house and our house with no response from the unit. When she comes back into the yard the collar beeps. Several times the collar just quits working for no reason. I then have to reset everything. Now I cant get it to work at all. Yes I have changed the batteries."
3,Works well but initial quality issues,"The first transmitter I received was DOA. Would not power up. It was replaced right away. Once the transmitter came in the collar's beep was so low you had to put your ear to it to hear. This was also replaced right away. The second one was better.The dog has reacted well to the training as called out in the instructions. This is my 3rd week and I think this is going to work wellAlthough there was some significant quality problems in the beginning, the company reacted well and replaced the items quickly."
3,Honesty,"I think this product is a great idea..it's a bit savvy to set up when you have a larger lot.....it seems to work, but still quite a bit of effort on your part to trust it to work..sometimes shock is strong enough, sometimes not.....work in progress tho...Im keeping it, so that might speak for itself...somewhat pricey, but way way less than fence....."
2,very distorted containment area.,The position of the containment area varied from day to day. I found that if there was any metal in front of the transmitter the signal disapeared. I am very unhappy with this product.
2,Unsure yet,"I thought this system would be ""Set it up...turn the dog loose."" It seems, however, that it takes quite a bit of time, dedication and perseverance to train your dog to this system...well, at least our dog, a rescued Schnauzer-terrier hard-headed dog! The humans in this family have not been disciplined and committed enough to complete the training. Shall post more later."
2,Didnt work in my yard,"My yard is narrow and like at least one other reveiwer, the system did not work correctly.It might be because it is not accurate enough to accomade a narrow area or maybe the sensors from one side confuse the other due to proximity.It is proabably a great product for a more normal yard."
3,Wireless pet containment system,"While the idea of a wireless pet containment system is a good idea (it is easy to install and way cheaper than an underground system) there are some flaws.The transmitter sends out a radio signal that can reach as far as 90 feet in any direction. And although this should create a perfect circle, the bounderies often seemed to fluctuate which made it difficult to determine our bounderies when we set it up. It still fluctuates from time to time and the instructions admit that this will happen due to 'eletronic noise' which affects the electro mangnetic field.We have had it up for over two months now and all in all it seems to be working for our dog. I would recommend that you try it and see how it will work for you."
1,Not that great,"This unit does not work consistently and really makes training the dogsdifficult..they are too smart and can figure out where the ""weak"" spots are."
4,WORKS GREAT,REALLY EASY TO TRAIN HER WORKS GOOD COUPLE OF TIMES IT WENT OFF IN THE HOUSE. WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY DON'T KNOW COULD INTERFER WITH IT BUT SHE HEARD IT NAD IT SCARED HER. OTHER THAN THAT WORKS GREAT WILL SEE HOW IT DOES CAMPING
5,amazing results,"best product ever! Very easy to operate, my dog needed very little training, keep the shock level down to 4, and he does great! ever if I forget the collar, he stays in yard.The battery life on collar is short, but well worth every penny. My dog is a 6 month old weimranier puppy at 71 lbs."
1,Very disappointed,"After reading the numerous glowing reviews of this product I decided it would be a good purchase for my home and dog.Repeated attempts to locate the perimeter were fruitless. Invaribly I would be able get a signal and locate the perimeter, but moving over a few feet I would receive no signal whatsoever. After a week of futility I gave up. For a perimeter fence it was absolutely worthless.One little item that I discovered is that if you have on older (pre 1960's) home, as I do, the unit's signals may be blocked by metal lath in the walls as well as lead based paint.Folllowing my experience I can only suggest the in-ground system unless you live in a newer home."
2,Wireless Fencing,This product was not for us. We live on a hill and when used the containment area fluctuated. We returned this product.
2,Not pwerfull enough shorted quickly,"I was desperate to get this item as my dog gets excited about chasing squirells, cats, dogs, mice, roaches, yah just about anything out here in the country. I put it on level 5 so that she would lear quickly as it is very dangerous for small dogs out here. It Didn't stop my sweet Lhaso Apso (who by the way is like my child as I can't have any) from getting through boundry on level 5 and yes I made sure it was on, touching her skin,new battery, and no metal or anything was blocking the radio signal. So after that I put it on 6, but then about a week later the wire shorted out, ( I didn't move it around even though it claims to be portable) but it was past the return date. The in ground one was much better, but I didn't bring it on the move to the Florida panhandle from Albuquerque, Nm."
1,Defective product for one specific reason,"This product is very poorly designed with problem the most glaringly obvious defect.I set it up, that was no problem. But this is a very rambunctious dog--supposedly exactly the product for my dog.I spotted it right away--if the dog simply kept running the collar stops working. I found the problem on page 4 of the manual: the collar has a safety feature that makes it stop working after 30 seconds.How stupid is that? My dog immediately learned that when it hit the boundry, and kept running for 30 seconds, he was home free. He was willing to tolerate the highest setting for 30 seconds of pain if he meant he could get out.So with one stupid & ill-thought out feature (did these people never have a dog?) they rendered their product useless except for timid dogs, NOT as advertised.And it doesn't even work properly unless you have perfect conditions."
1,Inconsistent,"This was inconsistent enough that we've had to ditch this and go with in-ground invisible fencing. Way too many gaps, and ran through batteries like nothing."
2,Very unhappy,"We purchased this product last year after the yard man kept cutting the wires for our Sportdog wired system. This product seemed promising, and had excellent reviews so we opted to spend the ""big bucks"" to keep our Houdini Westie inside our property. We set it up, after reading the instructions very slowly and carefully. Soon there after we realized that he was able to STILL escape. The fence system (big gray thing there) and collar were somehow not communicating with each other. Frequent calls to customer service have thus far proved futile. They always seem to blame it on our internet router, our garage, or anything else. The collar also seems to eat batteries, as we are constantly going to Petsmart to buy more. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product. We are so angry that we spent this much for a product that does not work and has almost gotten our dog hit several times and makes the neighbors angry with comments like ""get that dog out of my yard!""."
4,Prentice Hall Literature Portfolio,The book is in really good condition for the price. It works perfectly for what I need.
4,great for great for greying hair,quatum extra body acid perm has the best curly perm i have yet to use
2,disappointed,usually this is a good perm in my case I received a perm that was old and it did not activate I am disappointed
5,From inside flap:,"""One Crow, Two Crow,"" begins an old Maine folk chant. From this chant Chase has drawn her story... a novel set on Maine's lonely ""barrens,"" where ther land itself, fertile only for scrub and wild blueberries, breeds into those who live there something of its strength, its storms, and its silences.Here two young people, with differing tastes and ambitions, fall deeply in love and begin their married life, coping with the land's severity and relishing its wild beauties.In the nearby village, deserted by most of the young for the cities, are vividedly seen those who have stayed behind...earning their livings by farming or fishing, or even, during this Prohibition era, by rum-running from Canada along Maine's secluded coves and harbors.A story stark, gentle, and free of sentimentality... a story of goodness, of struggle and courage, and ultimately, of joy."
2,Poorly produced disks.,"This package came in plastic wrap, never been opened. The disks are not scratched any but on two different ps3s and two different computers, the disks skip a lot. Also, some of the disks are mislabeled and our recent discovery, Season 6, disk 4 will not load/play at all. No scratches or anything but will not play on anything that we have that can play disks. Very poorly made. We love NCIS but hate these disks. In contact will seller if they will respond, trying to work something out."
2,frappacinopoo is poo,The product was marked excellent condition.When I got it it was shrunk wrapped just like new.The first season contained two tapes 1&2 and no 3&4.The tapes skip and freeze at different points and when I tried to e-mail frappacinopoo.com to ask what to do it comes up no mail to this address.
3,"Stories great, DVD quality bad","I love NCIS and give the series itself 5 stars!!! I like the characters and the stories a lot. But this product (seasons 1-7) has lots of DVD problems. The vendor has been responsive at exchanging the unwatchable disks, but he's already exhanged bad DVD's with me twice. just think this set was very poorly produced. I wished I had spent the extra money to just buy each season individually.The DVD set was new, by the way."
2,Very poor service,I wrote and told seller Disc 1 of season 5 did not work and that Season 6 has two discs one and two and no discs five and six. They have not responded and I am left with a $140 mess.
3,Not so happy,"The product of course is terrific because the series is. I will purchase the rest of seasons as available. However, I purchased through an outside vendor and the product was advertised as new. At least two discs have the labels switched. Even though we always check to be sure subtitles are off, some discs have subtitles throughout, some have them on one or two episodes only and a few have had subtitles that come and go within one episode. Discs were not always in the correct order which is easily corrected. The casings were in fine shape and all outside jackets appear to be corrrect. It is my hope we can continue to trust Amazon to ensure they are not accidentally offering pirated copies of products."
3,Likes / Dislikes / NCIS: Seasons 1-7 purchased at Amazon,"Season 2-5 were great. No problems. Season 1 & 6 has a few spots were the screen froze which also made the words freeze and sound blurred. Season 7 was terrible. The whole season kept freezing. There was one or two discs where a whole scene was repeated. The disks did not appear original. I believe they were copies. The coverings were different than the rest. I sent two different e-mails to the seller and was completely ignored. I do not like writing reviews like this, which is why it has taken me so long to write. I am in the process of reviewing the cd's again, and am on season 7. (very disappointed & discouraged with the quality) Of all, that is one of my favorite seasons. I would not buy from this seller again. I do not believe it is good practice to ignore a customer or to slip a bad season in with the others. The seller either did not watch what he was selling or did not care. Either way - I have a bad season 7 that I need to replace."
3,NCIS Seasons 1-7,"Good shows - at least the ones I can watch. Several of the disks from the various seasons are scratched and shows and special features can't be watched. I bought the set ""new"" through Amazon, but from a vendor that offered a substantial discount from the main Amazon item. Don't know if set is bootlegged or a used set repackaged to look new. I guess you get what you pay for...."
2,Have yet to recieve this product not happy!! Ordered 2/6/11,Have not recieved this item yet ordered on Feb 6 2011 so right now the product may be good but service not so much!!!
1,Completely disappointed,"Okay where do I begin? The shipment came a week later than expected, but I can deal with that. I received bootlegs. No doubt about it. I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan and have seen my fair share of bootlegs. The video quality is terrible, all episodes are showing large pixels. I unwrapped season 5 and the first disk skipped throughout ever episode. The jewel cases are cheap and brittle, half of them are already broken. Some of the disks will start halfway through an episode as soon as I insert it. If you are going to sell bootlegs, advertise them as such, you overcharging con-artists. I could get better quality, more durable, copyright infringed horse crap in a third world country. Sad!"
5,NCIS has the best cast of any show,I absolutely love this show. The cast is so incredible that it's the reason why the show is so successful. Compare the formula to other shows and its not far off the weekly cop show formula. What makes this show successful is the chemistry between the cast members. You can tell these people love coming to work to be on this show.The whole series is a bit steep to purchase and if you watch the prices its probably cheaper to buy them season by season instead of the whole set at once. I saved about $30 that way.
2,DVD Problems,"Five stars for the show, two stars for the DVDs. I love NCIS however the DVDs themselves have some issues. Two of the episodes in season one have already failed to load from the disc menu. It simply loops back to the main menu rather then playing the listed episode. I have not yet returned the product and will have to see if the issue continues in season two."
5,Best pet cologne there is!,"We use this spray every time our dog comes back in from doing his ""business"" outside. We keep a can by the back door and one in the camper. We don't like the smell that a dog has once they've been out. A little spray from this cologne takes that smell away. It's the best product we have found. Love the powder scent!!"
5,Fresh and Clean!,"This spray made my tiny Yorkie smell soooo fresh and clean! He doesn't mind being sprayed with it, either. I would recommend the product to others."
1,not what I expected,"It is not working. My dogs fur starts to smell again after a few hours. I am an extreme nose person. So I am very sensitive to smells. This baby powder ""fragrance"" is nasty, I do not like it at all! My dog starts to sneeze as soon as I apply it and me too! Very disappointed about this product. I guess I am just going to throw around 10 $ in the trash!"
5,Fresh pug,"I use this product on our pug. While he doesn't enjoy being sprayed, it sure does smell nice and lasts a full day with moderate activity. Will purchase again."
5,Smells great but doesnt last too long.,Great smelling aerosol spray. Smells just like baby powder. Just wished the scent lasted longer. I have a pit bull/lab mix and he tends to get stinky after 3 days after a bath. The baby powder scent seems to only last for about 1 hour.Not so sure what the ingredients are (if its alcohol based?) but it does the trick. Highly recommended.
5,COOL DUDE!,This book is very helpful to help you with the crystal version. It is really neat too. It helps me figure out what do. I love it!
3,One good handbook for Pokemon Crystal,"What I love about Pokemon Crystal and the handbook (even though it's worth some extra money), it feels like I'm the guy in the game. This would be one awesome handbook if everybody could see it. It would probaly be rated number 1 on the hot things list.10-year old Pokemon fan"
2,Smells like urine covered grass,"This cologne is really bad. I thought it was okay when I bought it blind, but I started to hate it. It smells like a cloud of grass with urine rain."
4,"""Mg"" in the SKIN part","I'm sorry that ""Dr.??"" Manning is narriating some of this and using an electron microscope and identifies the symbol ""Mg"" as manganese. ""Euoohh, manganese, I like manganese; manganese is important."""
1,Don Meyer let me down,"Frosty seems like a nice guy, but the book is so dull. Don Meyer recommended this book on one of his tapes."
1,Not wide enough,"The illustrations show the net going from one side to another without much of a gap. The fact is the net has a gap 5 inches or more on each side. That is unacceptable. Had the illustration been factual, I would never have bought one. I returned mine."
5,Calendar,This calendar has great pictures and is a nice size so you can see the months clearly as a distance.
3,It's OK.,"The recipes that I have tried so far are not memorable, not something that I would make again. I like the the glossary and tips."
5,great book to get you started,"This book is much more than a bunch of recipes, it teaches process. I've recently found a passion for cooking. This book has been extremely helpful in allowing me to become a better cook. The other cookbooks I have didn't help nearly as much.I also like that it is large and lays flat without me having to put something on it. It means I can check the recipe without having to hold the book open at the same time. The vibrant pictures really inspire you to want to try out a recipe. I find that inspiration is often the hardest thing.In addition to all this, the recipes are great. I wasn't a huge fan of the pumpkin soup, but everything else has turned out wonderful.This is a must have for anybody who wants to start cooking good meals for themselves."
2,this suxs,this game sucks it get borin and it acts like u a beginner and the levels suck. The game doesnt keep u interested and makes u give up as soon as u turn the game on. trust me this game is a waste of money and time.
4,Really good,"Crash's second outing on the GBA is great, just like his first outing. It's still kinda short, and there really aren't enough bosses in my opinion, but you don't really notice those things. It isn't quite as good as the first GBA Crash game, but it is still a very excellent game that you really should look into! I really wish that this game (and the first GBA game, The Huge Adventure) was part of the main canon of the series... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,sam68simcity900,i think that i will not stop playing this game when i am bored. With most games you have to win that round. and then you can move on. on this game you can go to like a mini game. so you can practice your skills. and so you can know what to do. on that round.p.s. the game is the best. so if you want to play it I'm sure that you are going to love it.thank you 4 readingbye bye..............
3,Crash 8,This game is the 8th game of crash so far.It's a great game but get's boring.The game is not worth you're money but still it is fun in the begining.
5,CRASH IS THE GREATEST,"I bought Crash The Big Adventure game for my 4 yr. old grandson for Easter, he hasn't played it yet from all the reviews I know he will love it too! He loves the Crash Team Racing on PS1 especially the Adventure mode. It would be great if they came out with a game for the GBA like CTR I would surely buy it too! We have all the Crash games for the PS1. If anyone knows of a game I could buy him that would be comparable to CTR please post it on here and I will check back often. To the people that make these games maybe you could make a CTR for Game Boy Advance. Thanks"
2,Tasted bad and mold was not convenient to make the gummies,The activity was fun but the product was disappointing. The gummies tasted very different from the usual ones you could purchase in the store. Would not purchase again.
3,Great but very short,Great WordWorld that my kids love as usual but only 33 minutes long. I'm sure the DVD duration was listed somewhere but I just expected it to be longer like the others I've purchased.
5,A Christmas Present,We bought this for our daughter for her Christmas present and she was ecstatic! She loved watching and singing along to her Word World Friends and the lessons of each episode was meaningful.
2,30 min for $7?!,"My son loves Word World, so i got this DVD for him. However, the 'playing time' info on the product description misled me to think there was actually 60 min of episode on the DVD. Not so - it is 30 min. The other 30 min are commercials. Not worth $7 - sorry. Big rip off. Now i know not to purchase any more of these 2-episode sets."
5,Kids love it!,"I love this series! Even as I write this review, my 3 year old is jumping up and down because he sees the ""word word"" dvd picture on this page. He should actually be the one writing this review, perhaps. Anyway, you won't regret this purchase!And as a side note- if you're shopping for Word World DVDs, this and the other themed DVDs don't give you as many episodes for the money, but it is fun to have a themed video to play on the holiday itself."
4,Not as many episodes as I would have liked,Our family loves WordWorld. The only drawback to this DVD was only having 3 episodes on it. Wish they would put more episodes on it to make it a bit more enticing. I would buy it again tho. My daughter loved it through the holidays.
5,Great Fun,I love Dos Fallopia! Lisa and Peggy are a great team. The CD is hilarious. The songs are over the top and fun. I wish they had more CDs available.
3,Fine quality but not round bottomed,The part that was actually sent did not have a round bottom. Had to chisel out the door to make it fit.
4,Enjoyable horse book,"Another great edition to the High Hurdles series. DJ is forming an entrepreneurial greeting card business with her friend, Amy. Her horse, Major, takes an injury, and DJ is also going through a health/sleep-deprived crisis. A few happy things and surprises take place along the way... I'm eager to read the last two books in the series to see how it all ends!"
3,Gave out as a gift,I went to my daughter's first Thanksgiving meal. All was fine except for the serving of the turkey! They didn't have a carving knife! But's that's all right I sent this the next day with some other items they needed. All I know is that she likes it. Her Christmas party will be a little smoother. Oooh Baby you know I love you! (Just had to slip that in there!)
4,Replacement cable,The new replacement cable order was filled immediately arrived in just a few days. I attached it to the scanner and it worked as expected.
5,Easy and Beautiful!!!,My husband and I loved this border! I read the reviews and saw that people had trouble finding the directions so I went online and found some generic directions. We didn't soak the whole roll like the directions behind the label said...we just cut the length we needed and wet that portion of it. We had just painted the room the weekend before and used the paint tray with warm water to wet the wall paper. We used a squeegy and some wet paper towels to get any air bubbles out. It was very easy to install! Good Luck!
5,All Stars Border,"My husband and I both loved the border, but we also had problems finding the directions. We just looked up some generic directions off of the internet from a wallpaper ""how to"" website. When we were done and were cleaning up, I found the directions on the back of the lambs and ivy label. (Just in case you have to look too!!!)"
3,The Good And Bad,First the good news..... The directions are now on the back of the label! Now the Bad news.... The directions are not very helpful. Also the first roll that my wife and I tried to use was not prepasted thou the label said otherwise. Lucky that we over bought and did not have stop too run to the store to buy ether another roll or some wallpaper paste.
4,All Star border,"This border is a good do it yourself border although for longer walls it can be a little tricky. The shorter walls were easy to do and it took little time, but the longer walls were a bit messy. Overall the finished product looks good and we love the design!"
3,Too short with no help from directions,"We love the look of this border but beware the directions aren't anywhere in the begining to be of any help. We didn't stumble on them till almost the very end. THEN....we came up about one foot short on our wal, we had to go buy another roll just for one foot. We know others who have had the same problem and we both have very small rooms."
3,Directions,"My husband did our nursery as a surprise for me while I was out of town for a week. He'd never done a border before and had no idea where to start. He tried EVERYTHING he could think of and even looked up directions on the internet. Just as he was rolling the border up to take it back to the store, the directions fell out of the middle of the roll. It looks adorable on the walls and hasn't fallen off, yet. But I think the directions should be on the outside of the roll so you have a clear idea of where to start."
5,Sweet stories for my small children!,"I am not a fan of a lot of children DVDs out there but this one is one of our favorites! It begins by showing a woman with her dog painting and shows lots of animals on their walk home in the rain. The music is calming and lovely and then the story begins. I like to sit with my children and watch it together. My 2, 3, and 4 year old just love it."
5,Charming!,The stories and the animation were simply charming! Also loved the fact that the narrator had a British accent. I know my grandson will love watching this.
2,Unrealistic story and heroin does not deserve the hero!,"I gave this 2 stars only for Ramon's sake. I didn't like Kate at all. Seemed too uptight and a little stuck on herself. I liked Ramon becuase he seemed so devoted and loyal (too bad she didn't seem deserving!). The plot seemed too far fetched (going from multi-milionare to being a dirt poor farmer then back to multi-milionare overnight was just way too unrealistic). And the entire story takes place in three weeks! If I can't believe a story could possibly happen in real life, I can't enjoy the story. I find that all of Judith McNaught's stories that take place in modern times seem ridiculously unrealistic and end up being dissapointing, but her historical tales, (from mid-evil times like A Kingdom of Dreams) are much much better (you can use more imagination there I suppose to make up for the unrealistic things)."
1,A tender nightmare,"I'm short of words to explain what I really feel after reading this book, I will just simplifying it by saying that the whole story, characters and topics are extremely annoying and fake. Ramón Galverra is Spanish but have been raised in Puerto Rico , because is Spanish the ""stunning"" Katie think is poor , which it is true because he is ruined , however Ramón is willing to survive in modest condition in the island of Puerto Rico. He is brave enough to take with him in this adventure the spoiled brat Katie and............... no please, is to much.............this story is so full of chauvinism , discrimination , erroneous assumptions and stupid mistakes that I finish it just to be sure that this book was for real and not a joke......."
1,KEEP AWAY!!!,All of JM's book have made my stomach tingles w/ excitment and lasting pleasures b/c the characters and the plot are so smoothly entwine that you actually feel them and want to be part of their lives. Yet this one was truly disappointing b/c the plot makes no sense. The characters are not all what you think. Ramon is a male chauvinist who expects his girl to obey him w/o a thought of her own while Katie's happy thoughts are on materialistic stuff. I give her a star b/c all her other books are truly amazing whereas this one was her very first novel.
3,Save this one till last,"If you decide to read this Judith McNaught book, save it till last. That way if you never get around to it, you won't be bad off. Might actually be better for it.I've read the reviews on this one, and it's not as bad as most are making it out to be. I wonder if people didn't finish the entire thing b/c then you'd understand why the main characters were who they were and why they acted that way.this is not my favorite. this one is probably my least favorite, but my least favorite of Judith McNaught is a lot better than a lot of other authors best. While that doesn't excuse it, it is fact.This is a shorter book, so it does move along pretty quickly. Most of Judith McNaught's books approach 700 pages, and this is only 300 or so. Give it a try, I don't regret it. It makes for a decent book on a plane or on the beach."
1,Tender Triumph,"I bought this book because the author used my country, Puerto Rico, as the setting. But when I started reading it, I found that the location (eventhough at the beginning she described Puerto Rico in a lovely way)was transferred to Mexico with the vocabulary terms that are used like ""village"" (we call our small communities in rural areas ""barrio"" (precinct); ""cantina"" for drinking places, we call ""barras"" from the English word bar. ""Señorita"" is another word we don't use when we speak, we have adapated the word Miss as""Missy"". Many of the concepts are so wrong that I couldn""t enjoy the book. Ramón Galverra was Puerto Rican but the author insisted in telling that he was a Spaniard. My grandparents and parents were Spaniards but I was born in Puerto Rico and I am an American citizen by birth. Even the influence of religion is not as described in this book. The only good thing was that I fell in love with the principal character, Ramón."
1,"Very jumbled, is this really McNaught?","WOW, was Kate ever bigoted. She sees a Hispanic man and a pickup truck, so she figures he must be some sort of delivery boy working with produce. Never mind that Ramon is intelligent, kind, and witty. Noooo, he's Hispanic, so he can't do anything IMPORTANT, right?This book didn't make much sense to me. Ramon wanted a wife who could be happy living on a farm, and Kate seemed the antithesis of that idea to me. As far as I'm concerned, the two main characters only had one thing going for them: good sex."
2,Repetitive and boring,"I don't know about anyone else, but I got really sick and tired of hearing about Katie's red gold hair and blue eyes. The author didn't waste any opportunity to mention those particular attributes. It was as if the author was repetitively trying to describe how beautiful Katie was to make up for the fact that she was shallow, bigoted and snobby. She assumed that the hero, Ramon, drove the dumpy produce truck she saw on the street because he had a spanish accent and she continously treated like he was a stupid, uneducated moron throughout the book. And Ramon was no better. He decides that he loves her because she insults some guys in a singles bar even after she insults and offends him throughout the whole book. The overall book was boring and I started hoping that they would not end up together."
1,A Poor Showing,"I generally LOVE Judith McNaught books so I could not believe how much I disliked this one. The characters are not at all likable the heroine is a spoiled brat that goes out of her way to be obnoxious and the hero not only puts up with her garbage but looks the other way. I had a hard time finishing the story since the whole concept of these to unlikely people falling in love was just to much of a stretch.If you have never read McNaught I would recommend you read a different book by her such as ""Something Wonderful"" or ""Once and Always"" in order to see what a great Mcnaught book is like.Not everyone will agree with this review but I must say JM could have done much better."
1,I didn't like it,"Like many others of you love, I JM but this book just plain old sucked! lol First of all Katie is an racist and Romon is an idiot. Yes I too got tired of hearing about her red hair and blue eyes. Any Hispanic person beside a produce truck has got to be the rider of it...ofourse! That really upset me. Like is she really that stupid?? Katie seemed like a clutz. And then she goes on to defend Ramon at the pool side when one of her friends call him a name and that is suppose to some how many her honorable??? And Ramon is just a big old bafoon. Ordering her to change her clothes when they were going out to the pool, not letting her work, and being ashamed to show her where he lived just because it wasnt like what she was used to??? I didnt even finish the book and I paid for it! I couldnt believe that this was JM either. I recomend Perfect and Paradise. I was so surprised to see that so many people didnt like it also cause I thought that I was the only one."
2,This is why i stay away from Contemporary Romance.,"Okay...lets keep in mind that this is my first contemporary romance by JM,i've read almost all of her historical stuff and love it to pieces but unfortunately Tender Triump aint a historical and i dont love it either.in one word to describe the book:Freaky.I kid you not.i mean the woman is so trusting...she met a guy in a dark parking lot,let him drive her car,let him inside her apartment and then make out with him....i mean what?!does she has a death wish or something?!i'm just dunbstrucked by the whole plot,and thats not in a good way too.the guy's just to freakly obssessive(Dominant anyone?).Although the ending is good but the story lack a certain something...a logical plot."
2,Not So Good,"I agree with the critical reviews here. The hero is a chauvinistic sterotypical Latin lover. The heroine is a spoiled superficial materialistic brat. The message in the book is that strong independent females with challenging careers can never be fulfilled unless they are married, barefoot and pregnant.Skip this one. Try ""Perfect"" much more enteraining read by Judith McNaught."
2,Not in Judith McNaught's style,"Judith McNaught is one of my favorite authors, but I didn't enjoy this book and almost didn't finish it."
2,NOT GOOD ENOUGH,"i had to keep glancing at the book cover to be sure i was reading a JM. I mean she's one of the best of romance writers. this was a disapointment to me. i've read almost all her books and i've always wanted to keep them to myself xcept borrow my close friends, until this. i hate it when men try to ""test"" a woman's trust and love, which was what Ramon did. the story generally lacked depth which is part of what makes JM an all time best and the customary JM'S classic humorous dialogue was missing... good for whiling away time."
1,Who Wrote This Dribble?,"Judith McNaught is usually wonderful, but this book was awful. Ramon gave me the creeps. Handsome, sure, but he was overbearing and bossy in a menacing way. Please, take this book off the shelves!"
1,Tender Triumph not so Triumphant,"As an avid and loyal reader of JM's books, there are many things I have come to expect from her stories; strong characters with whom the reader may relate and an interesting and captivating story that is difficult to forget. To my sheer horror, the story of Ramon and Kate was utterly forgettable, having none of the usual characteristics of Mrs. McNaught's novels that delight and entrance the reader. Both Ramon and Kate were arrogant and I found the idea of a harmonious union between these two characters unrealistic. Kate lacked the wit of other heroines, though the constant reminders of her beauty try to distract the reader from this flaw. Ramon was a pale copy of Jordan Townsende, Jason Fielding or any other of JM's male characters. Overall a disappointing piece from an otherwise excellent author."
2,Not up to the McNaught Standard!,"I love Judith McNaught's books, and own them all. However, I was very disappointed in this novel. Katie is a fool who assumes that Ramon drives a Farm Truck because he is Puerto Rican! All of this despite the fact that he is fluent in several languages and speaks about international business with knowledge. Ramon is a typical McNaught hero, but Katie is a disappointment! This novel was written in 1983 and may explain my total dislike of the heroine. Read her other books, but leave this one on the shelf!"
2,Disappointing - to say the least!,"This book lacked the sort of wit, passion and sexual tension we've all come to expect from Judith McNaught. And it was boring (I only finished it because I had nothing better to do). If you buy this book expecting the usual magic from Judith Mcnaught - forget it, buy another book. I've read most of Judith Mcnaught's books and all had been excellent, that's why I was so disappointed with this one. No where near the class of ""Until You"", ""Perfect"", and ""Something Wonderful""."
3,Runt of the litter,"I enjoy Judith McNaught's books, but this was a disappointment. The story is weak, the characters are hard to believe, and the book is SHORT! It almost appears as if the book was written to fulfil some publishing agreement."
1,Dissapointing!,"Is this the Mcnaught I know and love who wrote this? Considering the hassle I went thru' to get this book, let me say that 'disappointing' is an understatement. The book practically put me to sleep. Where on earth did she get that Ramon character? Do they make men as myopic as that still? I guess I'm definitely better off with Paradise. I might as well read that for the 10th time. It would definitely make my day!"
2,Give me a break!,"Ok, i'm a big fan of JM, but come on, the hero (if you could call him that) is so narrow minded! He believes that a women should have to live on what he provides and dosn't think it's right for her to go out and work. Then when Katie comes out in a skinny bathing suit he orders her to go change into something more sutible, that's bs, she has a right to wear whatever she wants, it wasn't like they were really dating yet. Also the plot is so unbelievable! Ramon expects Katie to marry him and go live with him in Puerto Rico living on basically nothing, but that's not even the point because i understand if you love someone you might be willing to live in poverty, but they knew each other a week at the most! So they expect you to believe that a girl whose rich and has a VERY well paying job will leave it all for a man she knows for a week and who tells her what to do! If you really want something good to read try PARADISE, PERFECT, and ALMOST HEAVEN all by Judith McNaught."
2,Not her best effort!,"I am a huge Judith McNaught fan and love reading all her novels!! This one was not enjoyable and found it difficult to read all the way through. I was hoping the story would improve all the way up to the end, but it didn't. It seems like this novel was thrown together in a hurry and lacks her usual, beautiful flow/choice of words. The plot was weak, and so was the romance between between the main characters, Ramon and Katy. A disappointing read."
1,Did she really write this??,"Oh Goodness! I figured this would be a great book considering it's by Judith McNaught. Boy was I wrong. I agree with everyone who says this is not a good example of her work. I've read almost all of her books and this is the only one that I haven't liked. It seems like it has good potential -- the back cover sounds interesting. But, it didn't grab my emotions like the other books and I didn't really like the characters. Ramon seemed really rude and weird.... really weird. If you're tempted to read this, get it at the library!"
4,A Study on the implications of the trinity,"I can only comment about the first 100 pages. Because that is as far as I have gotten. I will finish the rest and update this, but the other review is very far off the mark.This is a solid academic book. It is by a number of academic theologians that are taking the theology of the trinity and working with what those implications are for other areas. So the opening chapter talks about the implications of the Trinity on how humans give gifts to one another. The second looks at economics. Later chapters deal with anthropology, Church Unity, history, poetry, worship, justice and many more.This is not a light book to read. If you are looking for an introduction to the trinity, this is not a good place to start. But if you want to read deeper into the implications of the theology of the trinity, this is a great overview."
2,"Verbose, confusing","I fancy myself an intelligent individual, but this text was well beyond my comprehension. It was assigned to my class in college and all my efforts to understand the detailed discourse failed."
1,Postmodern tropes that get lost,"Haraway attempts to pull together many different disciplines, thoughts, and ideas in her book, but unfortunately there is no praxis.The book is written and directed towards scientists, but from the outset the book alienates them.The book has very little to substanciate the ideas, other than self referencing.The ideas presented are interesting, and if you are able to delve through layers of meta-linguistic jargon the Modest_Witness could perhaps have a good discussion, but her synthetic form of muddled argumentation makes for a poor read.The ideas could have been presented with the tropes in a much clearer manner, the theories could have been supplied with some way to put them into action.I urge anyone who attempts to read this book, to thoroughly question the ideas presented in an attempt to find real world possible applications."
5,"Fantastic, Oscar Worthy",What an incredible talent......The guy has mastery over comedy...and gaeity (no pun intended)....His Columbia grad skills definately show in this body of work. The cinematography and the color choices....Strong visuals.Great great artist....Can't wait to see his next works
3,It is ok!,"This coat is VERY warm and good looking. However, something does not look right around the waist line, TOO big compared to the rest!!!"
4,"Great, stylish jacket","I love this, and for the price paid it couldn't be beat! I constantly get comments on how much people like this jacket. The leather is soft and very sleek looking. The removable liner makes it warmer, but even without it is quite warm. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a great looking jacket!"
5,Pokemon Movie,Brought this movie for my grandson and he was excited. The movie was very good (if you are a Pokemon fan). The condition was excellent and it arrived very timely
3,"Why are all these ""legendary"" Pokemon so weak?","Apparently the people that make these movies don't know their Pokemon. Why are all the legendary Pokemon so weak that they need Ash's intervention? Celebi, Manaphy, Latias, Latios, Jirachi, etc. What happened to all the supposedly powerful Pokemon kicking you-know-what? That's what I wanted to see in the series. But now the series is becoming way too monotonous, tedious, and lethargic. The stories are the same, rehashed, and predictable ones over and over again. All the movies do now is showcase the new Pokemon. There is no story. There is no display of that Pokemon's power. Hopefully the series will realize its potential with the upcoming movies, featuring Darkrai, Giratina, and Arceus. But for now, I suggest you rent rather than buy."
2,Not the best Pokemon movie,"The reason for my 2 star review is that as a Pokemon Movie, it doesn't really deliver what id expect. What i love most about Pokemon are the battles, the adventure and the laughs, Though this, like most of Ashs adventures is a big one, the story seemed bland and uninteresting to me, there were not enough Pokemon battles, not enough action and laughs. Me and a friend tried to watch it, but we were bored by the beginning half of the movie, and we just finished it cause we felt obligated, since i had just bought it. If those are the reasons you like Pokemon, pass on this movie, your not missing out on much."
5,great gift for child,Perfect selection for the holiday season. Brought a lot of joy and occupied their time
1,"A beautiful movie,Ruined By Cheap Voice Acting","Im a long time pokemon fan and movie after movie ive enjoyed watching my heroes adventures...However what should of been a great adventure turned out to be a calling for me.Allow me to explain, The movie is great, the animation is awsome and the story is fresh and thrilling. However as good as it is the voice acting is what drags this film down horribly.Pokemon Usa's decision to fire the original talented cast after 8 years of pokemon has backfired horribly. The characters have become dull,Boring and life less. Each word out of their mouth brings the quality of this amazing movie down and down.Fans are fighting back now join them in their struggle to save pokemon and restore it to its former beauty before the giant that is Pusa crushes it for good. [...]"
3,An Interesting Turn For Pokemon,"This is part 10/10. ""Pokemon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea"" seemed too long for me. Although I think that they upped the ante for cute legendary Pokemon, I really do think that Kyogre could have played a larger role. This movie definitely seemed more epic. I felt more grown up watching this. It was a hole lot of water though."
3,"Not bad, but not the best.","I have seen a lot of Pokemon movies, and this one is okay.The music: Except for the beginning there is not a lot of music.Butpretty good for the most part.Special effects : The effects are really good compared to a lot of movies really.I think, in my opinion, the movie needs a bit more action.Because at lots of times , it's just May playing with Manaphy.But overall this a enjoyable movie, and I would recommend this for ages 4-8.me ."
4,My sons favourite.,"This was a very good film, artwork was top notch, having a bonus discwas good to. My 2 sons always want to watch."
4,Overall a fun film!,This is a Good movie! It has a memorable mascot pokemon (Manaphy) and entertaining guest characters!Okay there are some parts that make little sense like Ash stealing the spotlight for no real reason but still... This movie is a sign that pokemon will continue to prosper for years to come!By the way Ignore groups like sova who will try to convince you to boycott Pokemon simply because of a cast change!The current voices show real potential! (especially when you compare the performances from this dvd to their work on the more recent episodes on tv.) I think if given time they will surpass the old voices!
4,Pokè fantastic,A 'must'for all Pokèmon fans. Great for all groups. So get out your popcorn and sit with your kids through another adventure full of suprises around every corner. I'm not going to give any of the details about this movie away...except that theres a big kid in all of us that want to experience the fun and adventures of Ash and his friends......You're just going to have to watch this to find out what its all about.
4,You put it on a drill and it spins...,"It's hard to rate this any better or worse than ""as expected"". It's a buffing pad... You put it on a drill and it spins. With the right compound for the application and a good technique, it gets the job done quite nicely."
1,Craptastic!,"Out of all the Marvel Legends toys, only Toad is a worse action figure. Why would they put a figure with such limited articulation in a collection of HIGHLY ARTICULATED FIGURES? The costume is a great re-creation of the god awful S&M number from that equally god awful movie. I think I actually hate this figure because it reminds me of Affleck. In any event this is one of the worst figures in this line. I hope the person who green lighted this is now working in hazardous waste removal with no mask or gloves."
2,lame like the movie,this figure is weak. the weakest of all the marvel movie figs. ben affleck is poo and so is this figure. i can't belive i spent $50 for the red skull fig which used this body. Oh mama!!
4,item as described,I recommend this product because it works for my application of hiding an air conditioner power cable in a cabinet. Quality plastic product. One suggestion I have is to use plumbers putty so this snugly fits into the hole you make for it.
3,K-Tel re-recordings,"There are some pretty good K-Tel discs out there, many with the original recordings. This has mostly re-recordings, but a few original hits. This disc has some tracks I never heard before, by artists I like. The only original recordings on this 2-disc set are:Mama Used to Say - JuniorWhatever I Do (Wherever I Go) - Hazell DeanBoys (Summertime Love) - SabrinaFriends - Amii StewartSearchin' (I Gotta Find a Man) - Hazell DeanRound & Round - Jaki GrahamAnother Step (Closer to You) - JuniorWatching You, Watching You - David GrantThese are all '80 British hits.The rest are all re-recordings... keep that in mind if you decide to order it."
4,Where's volume 1 and 2?,"Every serious birder should have the Master Guide. Unforntunately it is out of print and until the publisher decides to release it again so that one can have the complete set of all three volumes, it will leave a void in one's birding library. It might be out of date (1983), but the photographs for the most part as well as the text are extremely helpful when used in conjunction with other field guides. Sometimes it is the guide that will finally answer the question of what bird was that when the other guides have left you guessing. Here's hoping the publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, will release all three volumes again real soon! stormpetrel@msn.com"
3,Quality Control?,"I used to be a big fan of ViewSonic monitors, but this time, I felt let down. The VX724 has a nice design and it looked like the image was superb, but a single always-on red pixel ruined it all for me. I had read other reviews pointing out the dead pixels problem, but I had chosen to buy the monitor anyway thinking it might be related to early production issues.Don't they know when a monitor has such a problem? Shouldn't they catch it before it leaves the factory?I returned the monitor and bought a Samsung SyncMaster 730b instead. Not quite as nice (I preferred the VX724's stand), but at least the LCD is perfect, and that's what matters most to me.So I guess I haven't been lucky with ViewSonic this time."
5,Works Very Well,I bought two of these to clean up the mess of a phone system that I had. Three phone lines into an old style block were a mess to say the least. This has a capacity for four lines and it works like a champ and is super easy to use. I removed the plastic clips that are designed to hold it into the Leviton box and just screwed it directly to the joist and it sits square and solid. It even comes with a plastic punch down tool. I would not hesitate to buy again.
2,Thought it would get a better reception,"My 5 year old didn't seem to want to play with it.[]after about 2 minutes wanted to play a different book (that she has had for awhile and likes). I don't know what was wrong with it; she likes Nemo and was initially excited when it came, but she is not interested in it since that first 2 minutes."
5,this module is pretty good,"When my son wanted it despite owning a story book of Finding Nemo and despite owning a couple of other LeapPad modules I had my reservations. He loved the movie and I wasn't sure if this would just be similar to the book he had. In a way, it was but that is not the sole purpose of the toy. He enjoys the activities (games) in the book much like his other leapPad modules and because of the Finding Nemo theme, I believe he enjoys this more. My son just turned 5 and could read pretty well so I'm not sure about the reading benefits he'll get from this toy. But as long as he loves it I believe it's a pretty good buy."
4,Like it pretty much,"Pretty nice game. The illustrations do not look exactly like the characters in the movie. They are more like cartoon illustrated (see front cover-- the illustrations inside are similar). This was a little dissappointing at first. The voices are pretty good, it has some nice songs, and teaches some educational facts about the sea. My son's favorite part is the deep sea page."
2,Not Enough Bootcamp,I found this book to be quite predictable. Everyone ends up with the person you know that they are going to. It was pretty boring and I found that I was reading it but not taking it in. All of the stories could be better if they were their own 200 page book instead of 1/3 of that. The title is Bootcamp yet there were probably only 10 pages (at most) that took place at the camp. Overall I didn't like this book and I thought it was pretty predictable and corny.
3,Helps pass the time....that's about it,"I played the DreamCast version back in the day, and thought I'd give this game another try. It's a decent way to pass the time I guess, but honestly I'd much rather fire up something like Final Fantasy Tactics, or Final Fantasy VI (3 US). The battles just drag on and on, and for no real reason. Even normal attacks take just way too long. There's also WAY too much dodging in this game. You miss like 1/3 of your attacks against enemies. Other than curative spells, magic is just a huge waste of time. Lastly, the changing of your weapon color depending on what color the enemy is could have turned out as an interesting implementation, but it never really went anywhere other than having to open up the game manual and constantly check it to see if you have the right color weapon out or not, it's just a pointless hassle."
4,2nd to NONE!,"If you don't like awesome storylines, dazzling spells and moves, great battle ingines, over a hundred hours of gameplay, ship battles, or tons of weapons, this game isn't for you."
4,Best RPG for GameCube,"This is the best RPG I've seen for GameCube. The graphics are awesome, storyline is great. There is a lot to do and see under the moons of the Air Pirates. Although sometimes the random battles while traveling can become tedious (if you are in a hurry), there are surprises to be found that make everything else worthwhile. Easy to play without a guide or FAQ."
3,Very good Game!! but bad porting...,"I loved this game alot when it came out on the dreamcast! and was highly depressed when dreamcast met its doom and i was forced to sell it.....when i heard it came out for the gamecube i was really happy and didn't mind playing it again due to the extra features!! but once i played it, i was really shocked at how bad the audio mixing was!! it was so bad that it felt like i was playing the game on a regular nintendo system and to top that! the extras in this game are very unnoticable!!! graphics were the same thankfully!!.....anyways i regret selling my dreamcast because of this game!! it was sooo good , but like i said bad porting!! idk if its because gamecubes audio isnt as good as dreamcasts audio i couldn't tell! but i highly reccommend the dreamcast version it was just perfect!!!!!!"
4,its fun even with turned base action,i never thought id like a turned base action game but this game is a load of fun. the graphics may not be the best but the plot is good and theres always something to do.going around buying stuff and talking to people can be just as fun as the battleing parts. well you can either catch moonfish which gives you items or take on a bounty or just fly around in your ship looking for a fight. Its a very long RPG too it will take over 30 hours to beat so you better be ready.overall the sound is all right and the camera views can be kinda annoying but no big deal. if you have a gamecube and you like RPGs ill reccomend to you or just to anyone who has a gamecube.
4,A flawed masterpiece...,"Standard turn-based RPG battle system, check. Damsel and world in distress, check. Numerous random battles, ugh.Yet, this game transcends the sum its parts. The story is absorbing, the sail, explore, and discover new worlds aspect is engrossing, and the playable characters (yup, all three of them) are endearing. Isn't that why RPG enthusiasts get such a kick out of this genre. It's the disparate, loner characters, banding together and forming a family, and along the way (if the game is any good) they become our friends.I highly recommend this game. Look past the out-dated graphics, and keep pushing through those random battles, because what unfolds is definitely worth the trouble."
2,Bad Game,"This game was very disapointing. The accesories don't explain it well, and the battle feature stinks."
1,Rudimentary and generic,"There are many more comprehensive books available, this book wasn't even useful as a ""quick brushup"" or as an initial primer because it was so generic. Also, too much time is spent on really minor things - one sentance would have sufficed rather than several pages on how a messy office versus a clean office makes a different impression on the interviewee. Fleshing out how to ask useful and incisive interview questions and how to identify warning flags would have been much more useful.I've been very impressed with ""Hiring the Best: A Manager's Guide to Effective Interviewing"", and both newbie as well as experienced interviewers in my team have greatly benefited from it."
3,"good quality, wrong size","I'm happy with the quality of this costume, for what I paid, it's great. However, I think I can fit into and I bought this for my son. I'm left in a pickle though because it's too close to Christmas and I don't want to go through with an exchange because my son really wanted this. I ordered a small and got a large. I think I'm stuck with this and I'll have to tailor it myself."
2,"Re-Recordings, not originals","I was disappointed to learn upon receipt that of the 28 songs on this CD only 3 are original recordings. The Track listing should have an asterisk next to those songs that are original and post a note above the track listing that states *Selections marked with an (*) are original soundtracks. If this had been done, I would not have purchased this CD.The 3 originals are I wanna be loved by you - Marilyn Monroe, Happy Together - The Turtles, and Duke of Earl - Gene Chandler"
3,Mech Assault Phantom War DS Game-Fun Game-Fast Delivery!,"Just what I ordered! This product was just like the picture. Very nice Quality! Fast Delivery as well! Fun Game! Worked Great!Thanks, Lisa"
2,A nice erotic read,"I expected more from this, I am a huge Nin fan and I felt that the erotic parts of this book let me down. Either add more sexy or change the genre."
3,"Good stories, bad formatting","I really loved Nin's Little Birds. So, I was happy to find this book for 99 cents. Hey, that's pretty cheap. The stories are not on par with Little Birds, but, Little Birds is really special. It's pretty hard to compare someone's best work with something that isn't their best work. Comparing these stories with modern erotic 'literature' would give it a much more favourable review.However, the thing that really killed this book for me was the terrible navigation. These are short stories, but there is no navigation menu at all... no table of contents. No way to fast forward to your favourite story for a reread.For quality of work, I give this thing four stars. For the formatting and lack of a TOC, I give it 2 stars. Thus, the overall is 3 stars."
3,Lack of or miss leading diisclosure,"This is a two album set. Each album is miss labled. Album one, side one is labled #4, side two is labled #3, album two side one is labled #2 and side two is labled #1. Totally out of order and not disclosed in any of the prior information. The bottom of the album case has fallen apart at the place where now dried out tape once held it together. The vinyl is in decent condition and plays well once you figure out which side is which."
2,Baby Signs: How to Talk With Your Baby Before Your Baby Can,"We were disappointed in this book. There were a lot of cute pictures of toddlers signing, but very little substance. There are only a small number of signs illustrated and many of them are animals you would find at the zoo. It lacks day to day usefulness. Now that I've read it, I think a book on American Sign Language would have been a better choice."
4,great stuff,"this is a book about COMMUNICATION. if you want to learn ""correct"" American Sign Language (like the previous reviewer), get yourself one of the myriads of sign books. this book shows modified signs so YOU CAN SPEAK WITH YOUR CHILD and vice versa! the pictures are so inspiring of these kids and you can see their glee at being able to tell their parents ""i see a PIG!"" by using the sign (or at least their version of the sign) for ""pig."" i wish i would have had this before my son was one year old; i didn't begin any of the signing until 18 months. a very interesting and insightful book."
4,Wonderful,We started signing with my 1st child and it was such a help. Especially the 'more' and 'outside' sign. She used them before she could talk. She started talking on time and it didn't slow her like some said it might and she still uses them with the word out of habit sometimes and for emphasis when we don't respond fast enough. It's a wonderful thing. I'm going to do it with our 2nd child as soon as she's old enough. I wish it had more signs in the book we could teach.
1,Baby Signs,"The BABYS SIGNS book contains great signing info, but It advocates ""making up"" signs . . . inventing your own language . . . limiting a child's ability to ""communicate"" with anyone outside of the immediate family. It's easy to simplify ASL signs that a child may have difficulty with. Why would anyone suggest ""making up signs"" when teaching ASL will provide your child a language they can use as babies . . . a basic language they can continue to learn in elementary, high school and beyond. American Sign Language is even being offered in high school and universites to fulfill the ""foreign language"" requirement. I hope parents will consider this before teaching their baby a non-universal language."
4,Great illustrations,A picture truly is worth a thousand words. This book has a good starting vocabulary for baby signs. Each symbol also specifies whether the sign is part of ASL (American Sign Language) or a modified sign for babies. It is a good read and very informative.
4,"Great book if you like touching stories, needs a larger sign dictionary","I started out with this book when my daughter was about 6 months. She has some language delay but started picking up some signs by 13 months and by 15 months she was picking up new ones daily (she couldn't speak any words). unfortunately, this book doesn't have a very exhaustive list of useful signs so you will have to get a different one eventually."
2,There are better ones out there,"After reading a lot of good reviews on this book, I decided to buy. Unfortunately, after getting it and reading it, I realized that it's not as good as I thought. Doesn't provide much photos or pictures. The content is alright just too little visuals. Disappointed with the purchase."
3,Good idea but isn't it something we do already?,"This book is a nice idea, and I guess it's a good thing to buy if you really can't figure out a way to communicate with your child otherwise. However, I find that babies just naturally make signs and often accompanying sounds, if we only just take the time to observe them--even babies under a year of age. They are bursting with new information and most of them can make sounds, and even if the sound doesn't come out like the object's actual name, they are still saying a specific word that means a very specific thing to them. Eg, ""ah"" and pointing to something can mean ""I want that thing"". Or, a big smile and ""ee"" when the cat walks by probably means ""cat"". It doesn't mean you have to call your cat ""ee"", but that's a good time to say ""cat"" and still understand and acknowledge your child's ability to communicate. Overall, this book is more of an ""extra"", not something that you really need in order to talk with your baby."
2,It was not what I expected.,"The book shows photos of various ""signs"" invented by toddlers and parents. It is not a book that shows the ""correct"" signs that would be used by the hearing impaired. I was expecting to learn some proper signs, whereas the book focuses more on the signs that evolve from parents observing their own babies."
5,I can't wait to talk with my baby.,I'm still reading this but I am almost finished. It provides really good information about how and why to use baby signs. I also really like that their information is based on actual research that they have completed. I didn't realize all the benefits that can come from using baby signs. I look forward to being able to talk with my daughter soon.
1,Not what I was expecting,"I bought this book and returned it. The pictures were poor quality; they were all black and white. I was expecting more of a picture guide book format, but there was a whole lot more chapter reading than I anticipated."
5,Very Pleased,"I am very please with my purchase of this book. So much so, that I have also recommended it to several friends."
1,This book is not very good,"Baby Signs plays on the ambitions of parents but is mostly useless. The authors way over sell the idea that babies communicate with sign language. While this is true, in my opinion, babies use far, far fewer signs than the authors say they do. Also, the authors, like all authors of baby books, point out that all babies are different and that your baby may not be signing very much. The authors babies on the other hand are using, we are supposed to believe, several hundred different baby signs. The whole book could be summed up in about one sentence. Here goes; Babies sometimes use sign language before they can talk so watch for it and use signs to communicate with your baby and it will be rewarding."
2,Baby Signs,"Interesting theory. The parents I know who use baby signs have done so because their children are ""late"" talkers. I may be more convinced that Baby Signs helps children become better communicators if I had run across children who had decent vocabularies & whose parents signed to them when they were younger. Unfortunately I've seen parents use this as a crutch for 2- 2 1/2 year olds who aren't talking. So I guess it has it's place."
2,No need to read it just make up your own signs,"I was disappointed with the book.The first three chapters were basically about ""how good the book is"". I thought it would be using more established or universal signs rather than each individual's making up their own signs. Sure that's great for communicating within a family unit but what about when you've stepped out of the house and others are trying to understand what your child is saying. At least with using Sign Language signs it's a universal language and therefore will broaden our children's lives even more. I think we as parents already communicate naturally with our children. (i.e.)Others couldn't understand what my first son was saying while our family could understand each other and communicate fine. My 3 month old rubs her face against my arm when she's ready for sleep. I don't need this book to tell me that."
1,"Great concept, not great book","Signing with your babies, toddlers, and children is great! But why on earth would you teach them an invented language that will only be understood by the readers of this book when there are many rich beautiful sign languages that already exist.My cousin gave me this book when my daughter was less than a year old, when I realized that it was not using ASL signs I did my own research and found better sources. My favorite books and videos are the Signing Time series. There you can find concrete suggestions on HOW to teach your kids, hundreds of signs, fun lively songs that you will find yourself singing and signing even when your child is not around.For starts try:Baby Signing Time! Volume 1 DVDThis has most of the basic signs you will need to communicate with your baby."
2,"No signs for Mommy, Daddy, Brother, Sister","Our sister-in-law is a speech therapist and introduced us to the idea of signing with our kids. We signed with our kids and I'll agree that signing is very helpful. Instead of getting frustrated when they don't want to eat anymore and throwing their bowls off the high-chair, they can sign ""all done."" They can also communicate when they're tired and want a nap.However, this book spends a great deal of time and space to say:""Communicating earlier with your child is helpful.""I have to wonder at the utility of a book that lists ""Hippo""as one of it's words, but not ""Mommy"", ""Daddy"", ""Brother"", ""Sister"" or for that matter,""Poopy-Diaper."""
5,Great insights,"My daughter is still young but I plan to use baby signs with her thanks to this book. The writers have given excellent stories, research findings, and examples of how baby signs work to establish communication. There are chapters on getting started and more advanced signs and pictures of the most common signs to use as examples. However, what I appreciate the most is that your child will establish their own signs ... it doesn't have to be perfect sign language as long as you both understand each other. I've also bought Baby Hearts and Baby Minds and love those 2 books as well."
3,"Great research, no need to make up signs","This is a great tool for learning how and why to sign with your baby. I don't agree with making up signs though. We already have signs established in our Deaf Culture. Why not use theirs and allow it to be used later in life as well? I would recommend buying this book for the information but I bought a sign language dictionary with it, Teach Your Tot to Sign from Stacy Thompson and it has every sign that I have needed in it. It helped me so much to bring it along with me in my car and if I don't know a sign, I quickly just looked it up and my daughter learned the ""real"" sign for tree. Good luck and signing is a wonderful experience in our family, I hope it is in yours too.Annette"
4,babies signing,"This was a gift, however, since I sign for the deaf and know the ""real"" signs, it bothered me. However, it seemed very good for ppl who know nothing about signing and I believe the ppl I gave it to will enjoy."
5,Forego the frustration,"""Baby Signs"" is a wonderful book! It thouroughly explains the signing concept, and gives a great ""dictionary"" of signs to get you started. My daughter began doing the signs at 8 months and by 13 months knew about 40! We did not have the frustration in communicating the way our friends seemed to. I had so much fun with my daughter that I also used it for my son with great success! As vocabulary increases, use of the signs gradually diminishes. A really fun resource!"
2,Not ASL,"I agree in all aspects of teaching a child or infant to sign. It helped my son immensely when he was incredible speech delayed and today he still signs a great deal with his sister and at daycare. I teach sign language to the kids at his center and they love it. However, this book is not ASL. It is largely based on American Sign Language but has many made up signs that can not be utitlized in any community. American Sign Language is a language and I feel that that is the way it should be taught."
1,Why not use ASL?,"Why in the world would I teach my child a language that exists only for the people who have written or read this book? What an insult to him and myself to think that ASL is too ""complicated"" for us to learn. He is 8 months old and is signing milk and more in ASL to me and understands many more signs. I now wish I had known before wasting my money."
4,good baby gift,This is a really good affordable baby gift. The babies all know how to communicate. Life is funner if we know what they are saying. This book is good for the moderate rather than kids or beginner level. You'll learn more than just a few basic words. BUT it is easy enough to understand and use so you can advance at your own pace.
2,Ok if you take your child to the zoo all the time.,"I found this book rather blah. It really didn't get into the heart of communicating with your baby with signs. I dealt more with using general signs for cat, dog, phone, etc. I returned it and bought ""Sign With Your Baby"". MUCH more indepth."
1,Not very practical,"If you're already convinced that it's possible and desirable to teach a baby signs, you needn't bother with this book. I bought it hoping for specific, practical how-tos, but instead it's 90% cheerleading on the method. And the small glossary of signs doesn't include many of the ones that I would find most useful as a parent -- such as ""all done,"" ""hungry,"" and ""sleepy.""I had better results by just buying a pocket dictionary of American Sign Language and simplifying the signs a bit."
3,Qick dilever,The reason for 3 stars: Compare to Baby Signs DVD this one is useless. We did not have time to read. Recommended DVD.
3,Good research,I think that this book has some great stories to get you excited about signing. I love the research in this book. I would like more signs. I bought this book and a baby sign language dictionary called Teach Your Tot to Sign that has tons of signs that I use everyday. I suggest that you do that too if you want to learn more signs. Keep signing because our babies have so much to say and no way to say it with their mouths but they can use their hands!
5,signing constantly with my baby,"At almost 14 months my daughter can sign 40 words! It has been an incredible experience for our family. I ""talk"" (sign) with my daughter all day. Now I know the things she notices on our walks, when she wants a drink, more food, what kind of food, and when she's finished eating and those are just the highlights. We bought the book read it, and were very devoted to always signing so she could pick it up, and now she makes up her own signs. It is an excellent idea, and to those people who say it's not real sign language--you have small minds---English is not the only language in the world either. Different groups of people have different languages, why couldn't your baby? The bottom line--it works, and you get to communicate with your baby sooner and share the world together."
4,"Hey Michelle, here's one for changing a dipey..","Michelle, read your review above, and I do agree that the stories are cute and fun, but more direct plans of implementation would have been useful. I am glad I found this book though, and we are using it, my Son has just ""clicked"" with it, and has 5 signs now in 2 weeks! I wanted the dipey thing to be one of the first that he learned. Whenever I changed him, I would turn to my side and pat my bum in a very obvious way, and say ""Dipey? is your Dipey wet? Do you need Mama to change your Dipey"" and pat all the while. Now when he is wet, he will make eye contact and pat himself on the bum 4 or 5 times to let me know. Basically, the signs can be whatever you want, just try to connect it to some action relating to the word. I think the bum pattign was easier to teach him thatn say waving your arms overhead when wet... just make up your own and give it a try. It is fun."
2,Doesn't explain things in great detail,"I tried this book and it was great until i started downloading files, I kept getting error codes. I'm thinking I did not have a file that i needed. I also read the chapter about playing dvd movies and online video not very helpful.every time you download something that some one mentions either on the web or in a not very well written book like this, there is either another file that you need or a conflict that has to be fixed."
5,An excellent beginners guide,"I am a computer nerd, and I've been using Suse for roughly a year now, so you would think this book would be beneath me. However, it is an entertaining read.I gives a great overview of Linux, and all of the great stuff it can do.You can't expect a book to help you troubleshoot every piece of hardware you have. If you read the first few chapters you will find that most serious hardware troubleshooting will require some help from the linux community or at the very least some research online."
4,"Basic introduction to suse linux, more advantage if you have windows expereince","After more than 10 years experience with windows operating system, I plan to extend my knowledge into Linux operating system. I choose this book to study about SUSE.I found this book is written very clear and easy to understand, you do not need to have any experience with Linux before reading this book. I also found some point that is and strength and weakness compare to windows. If you never use windows before, it might be a little bit difficult to you because most of explanation in this book is compare to feature in windows.Thank,Kanel"
3,A beginner's book for Suse Linux,A beginner's book for Suse Linux. Filled with information for assisting anyone who wants to start using the Linux operating systems.
1,"beautiful, but...","The book is fantastic, inspiring and beautiful, but it literally fell apart after one (1) reading. How disappointing! The quality of the writing and the images did not extend all through the project, unfortunately."
1,Fell Off Window Within A Week,"I thought this was a nice, inexpensive window alarm. If someone jimmy opens the windows and slides it up, a pretty loud alarm would sound. Effective enough for what I needed in this application.The two components stick onto the window with a sticky pad attached to each comonent. I attached these to a plastic double-hung window as well as to a patio door. They stayed attached for less than a week. One falling off in the middle of the night, setting off the alarm. Both units failed. The attached surfaces were quite clean. They should have worked. II put these on my brothers windows in a town 175 miles away. Tossed the original display container so I can't return either of the units. Would cost almost as much to send them from Seattle and then onto Amazon. So I am out $11. Cheap is just that, cheap. Don't bother with these."
2,make sure your window/door is flush,I bought 3 of these for our basement windows and you must have them flush or they won't work. be sure your door/window and trim is flush or buy something else.
1,Junk. Period.,"Enough said ... Don't waste your money. Very cheap product -- I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The parts are cheap and they break way too easily ... The concept looks nice, but they simply don't work."
1,sucks,Batteries were corroded and alarms did not work.Batteries were corroded and alarms did not work.Batteries were corroded and alarms did not work.
2,Inferior Product,I purchased four of these wireless alarms. Only 2 worked. All the batteries were very weak and had to be replaced. I would not recommend this product. It is a poor upgrade of the original.
3,For the price it is good ....but,"the item itself is ok...had several returns on it [ bought 6 altogether ]but was never stalled or given an hassles.Just get some velcro from your local hardware store instead of using the stick pads provided. It cost about a buck.What happens is that the stick pads fail, when you're not home, the alarm falls goes off,until batteries wear out rendering item useless.Would purchase again knowing above."
3,Okay but not a great overall package,"This item consists of three door/window alarms, all of which operate separately, and a keypad alarm that operates by itself. We decided we didn't need the keypad since the three alarms covered all the doors and the keypad doesn't relate to the door alarms. Looks like they sort of just stuck it in there."
4,"Can't beat the price, works","It is so cheap it might as well be free :) It is not THAT LOUD, it is as loud as someone talking, not ear piercing. However it is loud enough to be heard from my master bedroom, so that is good enough for me. I initially ordered two of these, they popped right on the window in seconds. I already ordered three more along with a 20 pack of AG13 batteries to cover my front windows. They are very small, cheap, and work."
1,left out that i paid 4.95 for each of 10 items selling for 89 cents,"i purchased 10 window alarms for 89 cents each with a 4.95 s & h for each which all came in one box-8.95 worth of merchandis with over 40.00 in s & h from monroe wrote feedback but did not make it clear re the overpricing for items all shipped in one box. if they came in separate boxes no problem-they should ship by weight if sent in one box or they should charge more for the item. see anything out of sorts? you have my history of these items, if not i will provide Ann Bracey monroe com. window alarms ann bracey"
1,Review Impossible,"Since the seller did not ship the Intermatic SP440B which I ordered but instead substituted an unknown brand look-alike, I am unable to review. I certainly could give a review of the seller, however; but I don't think this language would be accepted."
3,Not loud enough,You can't hear the sound unless you're in the same room. I installed it on my front door and couldn't hear it over the AC from my bedroom.
4,Wonderful value,"Even after a year, the battery is going strong. This item works perfectly. When activated, it creates a loud sound after even the slightest movement. Just make sure to have more adhesives to spare in case the product loosens from its gripped position."
2,Not loud enough,"I promptly returned these because I thought they would be louder. I want it to be twice as loud!!! If a thief wants to break in - as one already did into my apartment and also did into another person's in my ground floor complex- this is what they did at his apartment- He had some kind of alarm like this on the window and they quickly just turned it off - so if nobody's home it won't matter one bit. If you are home, then it could help warn you. It probably would be loud enough to do that."
5,Loved these essays,"A beautiful book by a wonderful man. I heartily recommend it. Loved these essays, and I've enjoyed returning to them as well."
2,birthday party pinyatta,the pinyatta was sammll. I thought it would have been bigger for the price they are charging. it held up well to the beeting. I finally had to rip it apart.
1,received wrong towel,"Ordered the white Bianca Metropolitan hand towel and received a white Bianca USA Hotel Spa hand towel...phooey. Not worth the trouble to return, so will confine my towel purchases to local stores in the future."
2,Bianca towels,"These towels look nice in the picture. When I received them and was very disappointed. They are very thin. Even with the promotion, Buy the towel for $9 and get hand towel free it is not worth it. You can buy a towel at Sam's club for $5 that is twice as thick."
5,Unbelievable bargain!,I ordered these bath towels with the bonus hand towel and I can say that they are A+. They are very thick and luxurious towels. You can't find a better deal!
4,Very good towels,The good one I have ever bought from amazon. Soft and big size. I use wash cloth as hand towels.
1,The title of this book is misleading!,"This book should not be titled ""Fun in the Workplace"" it should be titled ""Giving presentations"". There is nothing in this book that even registers on the fun scale.It is not worth the $13.59 that I spent on buying and shipping."
2,Glorified Headphones,"These really aren't great. Below average at best. Spend a little extra. The Logitech mm22 speakers are WAY better. The price tag on these is attractive, but they're really not worth anything."
3,A Good Backgrounder,"Reading this book made me want to know more about this incredible musical unit called Procol Harum. This book covers the basic history of their formation, recordings, and member changes. I was hoping to learn a little more in detail about the background of their tunes, interesting stories behind them, and of course about the fascinating individuals who created all the incredible sound I've loved listening to since I first heard their ""Whiter Shade Of Pale"". Compared to the other PH bio book, ""The Gohsts Of The Whiter Shade Of Pale"" by Henry Scott-Irvine, however, I feel this book is written from a less objective perspective on the band members dynamics and their creative efforts. Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading it because I understand the passion this author had in pursuing this project. If I can give a half a star, this book will be 3.5."
5,Procol Harum: Beyond the Pale (Paperback) Claes Johansen,"Loved it --Reminds us that this band when the Paramounts were professional before we knew of the Beatles. Today Gary Brooker, alone or as PROCOL HARUM still going stronger and better today than any of the bands from the same period . This book let's you know why and you may not realize their very healthy success & standing even today in 2013 and this book published in 1999 -- even stronger now- great."
2,Disappointing.,I bought this random CD cos I thought I'd never go wrong with a musical recording but this one was a disappointment. I just want to fall in love with an album at a first listen but this one didn't do it for me. It lacks catchy songs. And it seemed a little short.Save your money for something better.ETA: 'Downtown Bohemian Slum' sounds like a ripoff of 'Mountain Town' from Southpark.
2,Disappointing,"After falling head over heels for I Love You, You're Perfect I was very excited to hear this album, but it was a complete disappointment. I didn't find myself falling in love with characters or songs, or even caring to follow the story. The singers are OK; the lyrics fall flat at almost every turn; and the story is a snore. I would not suggest this for anyone except the collectors. Favorite song: ""The Better Man Won"""
2,"What's this ""Thing About Men""?","Must agree with MingBing ""melly""- this was a disappointing CD. Picked it up as a lark along with SUNDOWN and THE IMMIGRANT (needless to say, I enjoy hearing something new.) MEN just didn't cut it for me. Lackluster score with only the occasional bright spots, which were not enough to win me over. (How did this show ever run in NYC?) Of the three CDs, SUNDOWN is the only one I listen to on a regular basis (and why hasn't this show been done in NYC?)"
4,The French Quarter Rocks Again,"I relistening to this audio production recently, I cant change my review--i totally agree with myself. It is a tribute to the talented artists who loved and made this city their home and the people who are this cityHere what I said before-I was transported to New Orleans. This multicast production blends and meshes together like a spicy gumbo of music, effects and dialogue. Innovative and unique. You won't be disappointed in this groundbreaking audio theatre work. Dana Dyer Pierson is one of the finest sound designers working in the industry today.May I add Joel Pierson captured the live New Orleans Pre storm in this audio script and I hope one day, it will come back to the same way this audio has it portrayedLets Rebuild New Orleans back to where it was and the FRENCH QUARTER shall rise again like a phoenix from the ashes!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
3,Hard to bash its head off,Fun for birthdays but this thing took forever to break apart. Feels sort of odd to complain about something being too well made.
5,Simply Beautiful,My friends and I had a blast with this Pinata. Used as motive and decor for a party.
5,yeah boy,man my mom is gonna love this -anne murray AND johnny mathis!God is real... and apparently hes in the CD manufacturing business now...
2,Pointless,"This toy is just pointless. You can bend and manipulate it, but how long is anyone really going to want to do that continuously? I would skip it honestly."
5,Fantastic Ear Candy,"I'm a newcomer to Stereolab, only joining them with the recent ""Margerine Eclipse"" album, which is one of my most favorite albums to listen to in my whole collection.Yesterday, a box arrived containing both the new ""Fab Four Suture"" and 1996's ""Emperor Tomato Ketchup,"" one of their best-reviewed albums.Long-time Stereolab fans seem to not like these last two newest albums as well as stuff from earlier in the career, but I like them better. They are much more melodic and fun to listen to--frankly, they're just more MUSICAL than some of the earlier stuff.Maybe not as much of a challenge as some of the more groundbreaking stuff, but if you just want to make your brain release pleasure endorphins from listening to fantastic, complex music, this new one and ""Margerine Eclipse"" are your best bet."
5,They're Baaack...,"In my opinion, this is the best CD Stereolab has released recently. ""Sound-Dust"" had a few good tracks, and ""Margarine..."" was remarkably unremarkable.With ""Fab Four..."" the groop has distilled their earlier sounds from such exceptional works as ""Mars Audiac...,"" ""Emperor Tomato...,"" and ""Random Transient..."" and their cool horn grooves from ""Cobra..."" into a refreshing new CD.If you haven't seen them in concert, check their current tour dates. They are amazing."
3,"Not their best, not their worst.","I've always found that the 'Lab's singles collections and EP's (Aluminum Tunes and First of the Microbe Hunters, for example) are usually somewhat inferior to the material they put on their LP's. It might just be an issue of cohesiveness, that their albums flow together better than their compilations.That said, Fab Four Suture, seems to suffer in that regard. There are some truly great songs here, ranking with some of their best work, but there are also songs that feel like there's something missing or that they've done it before. ""Interlock"", ""Get a Shot of the Refrigerator"", ""Visionary Road Maps"", and ""Whisper Pitch"" are the highlights for me, but for the most part, the album is enjoyable to me as a stereolab fan.I wouldn't recommend starting with this album if you have never heard stereolab before. Emperor Tomato Ketchup or Dots and Loops would probably be a better place for that, but stereolab fans will most likely enjoy this."
2,YUCK,"I love the Bargrooves collections, I own everyone, and I have never been so disappointed as I was when I first listened to The Spring Collection. I'm from San Francisco, been here nearly 20 years, and it saddens me that a fellow San Franciscan could screw up so badly what has been a pretty consistent collection of superb house music.I Failed to find the smooth beat that was described on the cd insert. I'm sorry Andy, you're my man, but you screwed this one up bad! Disc one is just a casio keyboard 1980's trendy madness. I could not ever finish the whole thing, disc two makes up for it a bit, but still over all I sold this CD the second day of having it. If you like the old style of Bargrooves, then the spring collection is not for you. Bargrooves is not the same without Ben Sowton, thank god after ""popular demand"" as he puts it he will be back on the next installment. Save your money and wait for the Fall 07 release."
5,My daughter's absolute favorite toy!!!,"We bought this for my 11 month old daughter when she was about nine months old, and it has been her favorite toy ever since. She can ride around in it for a half hour and still cry when we take her out. She grins and laughs almost the entire time she's in it. The only thing I don't like is that the strap that goes around her waist is velcro and she's figured out how to rip it off. Besides that it's fabulous and I would recommend it to anyone."
3,It jerks when the button is pushed,"I bought this for my 18 months old son last week. It took me a an hour to assemble it, then another 20 hours to fully charge it. But after all of the efforts, it was a disappointment to see my son scared to get into it after his first try. The car jerks when the button is pushed because it goes from 0 mph to 2 mph in no time. It would be nice if the speedup is smooth and slow.My neighbor discovered a workaround. You need to use the parental control to lift up the back wheels a little bit(let them leave the ground) and push the button on the handle, wait for one second before letting the back wheels touch the ground again. The back wheels are powered up, so if you can let them leave the ground when the jerk happens, it will be fine.I probably need to wait a day or two before letting my son try again."
2,Very Cool - But Unsafe,"We buy 90% of our stuff from Amazon, and almost never spend the time posting a review. This time is different, as this review is for Parents.The car is neat, very solid, not to many parts to put together.However, the girl in the photo as a seat belt. But it doesn't come with one. It has the slots, I was even about to call them and say, I have missing parts (the seat belts). And there it was a piece of paper inserted into manual. This model doesn't come with seat belts.So we tried 2 long drives (about 1/4 mile round trip)Our son stands up with excitement, once falling to the right side (as he was looking for us from behind). It's a car, you always, always promote seat belts, as it's law for a real car.As a parent..It moves to slow. We are NOT speed walkers but man, while Vaughn loved it, we we found ourselves pushing it (trying). While fun to watch him enjoying live, it was a painfully slow walk. Just 1 more mile per hour..."
1,"Bad product, don't buy it...","This is a really flimsy product. It is hard to maneuver/drive. It came without seat belt and when I called fisher price about this they informed that seat belt is discontinued as it is of no use. I do not buy that argument, my daughter almost fell on a couple of occassions (she is over 13 months). Overall there is no fun in this as there are no horns or whistles in this and it is very hard to drive (both for kids and for adults using the rod).I decided to return it, but it is almost impossible to disassemble the steering wheel and without disassembling it you cannot put it in the box. I am still struggling to disassemble and am figuring out how to return this piece of crap."
4,Grandsons first car,"I bought this car for my grandsons first birthday,but was a little disappointed with it. No seat belt and the car will move with the back rod in,because the way it reads on the discription it shouldn""t move. My grandson almost fell out of it and hit his head on the cement floor."
3,CUTE CAR! BUT NO SEATBELTS!!!! REALLY????,"This is a super cute toy, but very disappointed it doesn't come with a seatbelt as shown in the picture. If it wasn't such a hassle, I would send it back. We called the manufacturer who informed us that they no longer make these with the seatbelts because they were just for show. They need to change the picture because the main reason we bought this was because it came with a seatbelt! :-("
3,NOT FOR A THRILL SEEKER,MY 14 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER LOVES TO GO FAST AND CRAZY!!!!!! THIS WAS NOT A VERY GOOD PURCHASE FOR HER. I DO HAVE TO SAY IF YOUR CHILD LIKES TO TAKE IT SLOW AND YOU AS A PARENT DON'T MIND WALKING SLOW THIS WOULD BE A GREAT PRODUCT FOR YOU. WE PURHASED THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER BECAUSE I WAS PLAYING MONSTER TRUCK WITH MY OWN TOY AND DIDEN'T REALIZE THAT HER STEP 2 RIDE N PUSH WAS BEHIND MY TRUCK ooops AND I SQUISHED IT GOOD . SO MY HUSBAND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO GET HER THIS VEHICLE INSTEAD OF JUST REPLACING THE PUSH CAR FOR THE SAME ONE WE KNEW SHE LIKED THAT ONE. O-WELL LIVE AND LEARN!!!!
2,"check out the far superior Little Caesar,starring Edward G. Robinson","for a number of reasons,this James Cagney vehicle just didn't do it forme.i found it dreary and depressing,and slow.the whole film had anatmosphere of oppressiveness to it.plus,i had just watched LittleCaesar,another Gangster picture,this one starring EdwardG.Robinson,prior to Public Enemy.Little Caesar was released a yearearlier than Public enemy.i feel it is a much superior film.thecharacters are much better written,as is the story.and i also feel thatRobinson had more screen presence than Cagney.Public Enemy was veryhard to get through,although the ending(which was no doubt shocking by1931 standards,but is tame today)redeems it slightly.for a much bettergangster film of the same era,i would check out Little Caesar.butthat's just my opinion.for me,Public Enemy is a 2/5"
4,Like a looking glass,"I have seen this movie five or six times. The one thing I can tell you is that it really has the feel of a culture that is gone. The twenties and thirties were perfectly captured here. Some of the acting is just par, but Cagney takes your focus away from the lower actors and makes the movie. Unlike any gangster movie today, they wern't making this movie to portray an event from decades ago but from the news of the day. That is a much more difficult thing to do, and this was the first gangster movie. This movie has alittle of everything. Tramps, murder, abbuse of a woman(remember that this is just post Victorian era), crime, alittle racism(I mean it is the thirties), and a flaming homosexual. Is it perfect; well no. But, it is still a good movie if only for the historical sense. If you like a more character type of movie check out Little Ceasar, or like a different a more convental gangster check out the original Scarface."
4,Classic Period Piece,"Public Ememy is a classic ""period piece"" that takes you back to that time & place in American history (which is what the truely great period movies do) and it still ""hold up well"" even though it is going on 80 years old."
3,good movie - good view of 1931.,"I liked this movie less than I thought I might, based on the other reviews. I still give it 3 stars, as better than average, but not 4 or 5.Viewability is lost a little on the VHS version I rented. But what interested me was: 1. watching Cagney in his first movie, knowing he was destined for superstardom and 2. watching a movie made in 1931 when my mom was only 8 years old. Defineately worth renting for the average movie watcher."
3,"Okay, but hardly great","The Bottom Line:The Public Enemy may be an important film in the history of cinema what with being one of the first ""social"" films Warner Brothers churned out, but it's a patently simple story of a gangster's rise and fall that pales next to later gangster films and even contemporary ones like Little Caesar and Scarface: yes James Cagney shoves a grapefruit into Mae Clarke's face, but so what?2.5/4"
4,CLASSIC CAGNEY,"Bristling with '20s style dialogue and desperation, the taut, gritty and hard-hitting, THE PUBLIC ENEMY (1931) is the one where Jimmy Cagney squashes a grapefruit into Mae Clarke's face. Cagney's powerful breakthrough performance as street tough Tom Powers was only because production head Darryl F. Zanuck made a late casting change.This virtual time capsule of the Prohibition era contains several minutes of recovered footage not seen for 75 years (deleted from subsequent reissue versions due to enforcement of the Production Code).Extras: a 1931 with newsreel, ""The Eyes Have It"" comedy short, ""Smile, Darn Ya, Smile"" cartoon, and ""Beer and Blood: Enemies of the Public"" featurette. The commentary's by Robert Sklar."
1,I would like to give it a 0 rating,"Mary Daly hates men! I'm not sure why she hates men so much, but she does and this books proves it. As a black feminist scholar I always back away from Mary and any other feminist who quotes her because she is very racist as well as sexist. I'm truly amazed that her stuff gets published. This is why black feminist have seperated themselves from the feminist movement and have started the womanist movement (because people like Mary Daly who publish stuff like this give feminism a really bad name)."
1,twattle,"The most ridiculous tripe....... should only be read for the laugh!! Specious feminist arguments that are illogical, distorted, and pernicious should anyone take this seriously."
4,CAN'T STOP WACHING !,"One day I came home from school. I saw my sister waching a spider man show. I thought it was ultimite spider man . Nope . The show i once thought was ""Corny"" . I wan'ted to wach it and I did. I found my self in a habiat of waching it . Good show . Some bad part though , like eltros origan . And lizard transforming into a lizard . Still a good show . Spider man battles 3 enimeys in this : Vulture elctro and lizard ."
4,These boots are made for STOMPIN!,Foul Moudama is a Muftak Jedi and appeared in the Clone Wars animated cartoons fighting alongside Shaak Ti and the Ithorian (Hammerhead) Jedi Roron Corobb attempting to protect Chancellor Palpatine from General Grievous. The figure uses the same mold that was used for the Cantina patron 2-pack Muftak and Kabe set but he is distinguished by wearing a vinyl Jedi robe and a pair of huge vinyl removeable strap-on boots so you can place the hole in his bare furry feet on the included display stand or stand him up with his boots on. He also includes a blue Jedi lightsaber that he cannot grip in his open hands. Hasbro should have sculpted a new arm for this figure so he could at least brandish his lightsaber. Foul Moudama has been a difficult figure to find at retail so Amazon may be a good last resort if you are looking for one to open but collectors looking to purchase one mint-on-card may be wary for fear of receiving damaged cards.
4,"he's not foul, he's just a toy","of all the jedi figures this one has to have the least articulation. with that said i still love this figure. he is a sturdy figure so know that when you stand him up, he will not fall. he doesn't hold his lightsaber well so using one of those clear rubber bands, that hasbro loves so much, to secure it to the hand helps. his boots are a nice touch. all in all what jedi army would be complete without Foul Moudama. Add it to your collection, you won't be sorry."
2,Forget the Kindle Version,"Obviously, the Kindle version doesn't provide the ""cute color photos"" other reviewers say provide redeeming quality to the book. Worse, it has spacing and layout errors, as if one were trying to open a file with the wrong software. Makes it virtually unreadable."
2,Don't bother with this one,"There are few insights from this book that you can't get from the web, with a lot less reading and for free at that. There are many ""cute"" pictures and lots of breathless admiration for the breed but few germaine details. The details that are included are often times silly, the description of shampoos with an obcession about pH., for example is over the top.I gave the book to my mother-in-law."
5,"AN EXCITED ""NEW"" OWNER TO BE","This is my first Havanese Book and it was recommended by the breeder of my new puppy and I'm delighted to say that it's such a wonderful resource that I'll probably not need another. Delightful writing, very informative and has now become my Havanese Resource Bible. After almost 30 years in the Siberian world I needed an education into the world of the Havanese and this is the perfect book. I pick up my Havanese puppy soon and armed with this fantastic book I feel ready...well almost! Thank you Kathryn."
5,What a wonderful read for Havanese Fanciers!,"Kathryn has written what should be a must for all Havanese lovers and owners. She has taken the time to include all Havs from champions to companion dogs and the pictures included are so well described with owners, breeders and titles won, if any. I particularly like the chapter that describes the characteristics and a back-up story that has to get you laughing. Every subject about Havs is written about so it is easy to understand and with detailed information.Excellent book for any dog lover!"
5,Worth Every Penny!!,"Great information for the prospective, new or even older owners.The pictures are very helpful and the content is just good down to earth, easy to understand recommendations. You can tell that the author has years of experience with purebred dogs and also has a gift for writing. A must have for all owners and a wonderful addition for breeders to add to their new owner packets!E.Ann Ingram"
3,For the true Havanese lover,"Kathryn Braund writes ""The Joyous Havanes"" in a colloquial style which makes for an interesting read. The book is a thorough reference book for owners and/or lovers of the Havanese breed.If, however, you want the facts maam, just the facts, another book might suit you better. There were more pictures than I wanted to see and the breeder information was of little interest to me."
4,Havanese dogs are a best-kept secret,"I loved this book, but would have prefered COLOR photos everywhere. This book has a wonderful insight into Havanese. The author has been in the ""dog world"" for years and has experiences to share. If you're considering a Havanese or already have one, ""The Joyous Havanese"" is just great reading. What a glorius, fun-loving, happy breed. We are loving our little Havanese puppy, who is just four months old today!"
4,"very good and helpful, this was a purchase for mycollege age grandson.",i was very pleased with this product - the price and the rapid response and delivery. I shall return!!!
3,Sizing,"I Like the ring but the sizing is all wrong. I ordered a size 5 which is what size i always have been. But this ring was at least a size 4, and i know my fingers didn't get fat because my wedding ring is a size 5. I would recommend this but i would say to order a size bigger."
3,Nice Little Gift,I gave this ring to my sister and she seems to like it. My sister says that CZ jewelry looks good and can be worn in the workplace without the fear of losing a valuable gem.
1,Save your money,"You are much better off buying a real Palm handheld. I have had this one for a few months, and it goes dead VERY quickly. Restoring data is a matter of re-sync ing the thing. Resetting the clock is much more of a pain. Using the supplied stylus is difficult. Plan on carrying a real stylus along. It is also big and heavy, although that is in style now. The display is very difficult to read in low light. All in all, it really isn't worth the cost - even if you got in at $29.You're better of using your cell phone to store you stuff!"
4,Love It,I love electronic gadgets but hate to carry stuff around. The Wrist PDA is a handy way to carry around all my PDA info and have access to it right on my wrist. It was easy to install and setup. The down sides to it are: It's very small to read. It's so small it can be hard to use the stylus to hit the icon that I want. You can't type on it or take notes due to size of screen. The battery has a realitively short life and needs to be plugged in and recharged at least everyday or it goes flat dead. But I can live with those. Moreless it is a great reference tool!
3,Great Watch - But real bad battery life,"This is a real good watch, looks real nice, has all the goodthings in favor. Only thing bad is the battery life, you would need to charge this every day. For someone like me who is used to Citizen Eco-Drive's this is a real big change. I have turned off the all the alarms, the IR receive is turned off; the only thing on is the Watch Face. Even then this hardly last 24 hours."
3,My Unit Was Unreliable,"Worked great for a few days then screen only came on during resets.Also, MUST, charge everyday if you use more then 3-alarms w/snoozes. Had to send back. I hope future models are more reliable as i really would like to have one on all the time."
3,Has several problems,"Although I believe this is a useful and well priced device, it has serious problems that needs consideration before purchase:1. Very low sound (really, I mean it! I can hardly hear in a silent room)2. Low memory (not enough to carry my calendar)3. Short battery time"
1,fossil abacus fails the test,"I was pretty psyched to receive this watch. with palm OS i though for sure that it would be the answer to my prayers.Unfortunately it has a very short battery life. Has to be recharged for a very long time after a day of use.because it had such a shaky battery life, it failed to do the job that i wanted it for. help me stay on top of my appts, to do list.the onscreen keyboard is also very tiny, so i would imagine if one has vision problems, that its not the watch for you. I have 20/20 and even i had to squint sometimes.Disappointed"
1,Fossil Service Unacceptable,"The PDA itself is OK. The screen is small, but that is to be expected on a Watch.My PDA has a very quite alarm. If it is not held next to my ear, I can't hear it. It has been in our house alarming for an entire weekend with no one noticing! It is much quieter than any watch alarm I have ever had or heard. I suspect it is defective.I have tried to contact Abacus (or Fossil) 3 times regarding this. The first time the service rep said that someone would get back to me. No one did - and it is 4 month later.The second time I tried the email approach given on their web site. No answer. (Now the ""contact us by email"" on their web page connects to that web page - not email.)The third time I called, their phone system put me on hold for about 45 minutes and then hung up on me.I have given up! I have abandoned the PDA. And I doubt that I will buy anything from Fossil/Abacus again."
2,Gimme a long life battery,"Its kinda cool for a PDA on your wrist, but the battery doesn't last for more than a day at most... I'd use it more if I didn't need to charge it every night. Plus all the data (at least on mine) gets erased if the battery dies. It was a nice try, but not good enough."
2,Has all but not worth,I bought this watch only coz it was cheap like 29.99$. As I like gizmo things so this was a sure buy but after buying the drawbacks were more like very low battery life ...half a day and IR issues. The light is too dim on this watch and takes a while sometimes with the sytlus to get use too.I will suggest only this watch if u like collecting watches and want this one just to have it as now the mrkt is full will more advance things
3,Nice try,"Too bad this was an idea that never went anywhere.--Yes, a screen can be too small sometimes.--Battery life 24 hours? Even if 48 hours, that's too short. It would be practical if it needed recharging maybe once a week, like a cellphone."
1,"Very fragile, will last the longest left in a drawer at home","Had the watch for three full days, was fine one moment and crushed the next. Use extreme care when wearing this item. Oh and the extended service plan doesn't cover accidents."
2,The gadget freak in me had to have it..,"It's gentle, it's huge, it's heavy... I've had two of these they both broke... Maybe you're a little more gentle with your watches than I am, but this thing just didn't work for me, I tried to love it, but my loving is just a little to rough for it..Pros:Awesome PalmOS universality (full featured organizer with unbelievable support)PalmOS programs - literally bazzilions of them.. Seriously.. Games/astronomical/scientific/graphing calculators/dictionaries/pdf-excel-word readers/etc. etc. etc.Cons:Big&Heavy;Will fail..."
4,Must have g33k Item!!!,"I absolutely love this watch. I have owned it for about 3 weeks now and my only complaints are the alarm chime is too quiet, and the battery life is short ~2 days.If you take the perspective of the watch being a PDA then the battery life is not such a big deal, just remember to recharge it daily, we do this with our cell phones anyway.Most all applications that run on a OS 4 device will run on this watch.Be sure to get the watchface Yotta (Google it), as it completes the watch by showing datebook and todo items on the watch face."
2,Giant,"Compared to my other watches, this is gigantic. It is heavy. It looks cumbersome and overwhelming.I was unable to clearly see the very tiny screen fonts. Unusable.Back it goes."
4,Great Product for great price!!!,"Great Product for great price!!!I really enojoy the product, but the only draw back is the charge doesnt hold for a long -:(! other than that its really kool!!!!"
3,Battery ruins fun,"I really like this watch, but battery ruins all the fun. 18 hours is about the most I can get out of it. Other than that, even with basic software that comes with watch it makes a nice secondary PDA.If you don't mind taking your watch off frequvently to recharge, then buy it. If you're the kind of person who really depend on PDA, then do yourself a favor a buy a proper PDA device."
3,Great looking need more protection,"This cover is not good for a young adult as it does not provide enough protection. The cover is great if you are easy on a kindle, however even in the cover the Kindle was damaged when sat on. I would recommend an otter box type of cover that has a stiff interior that would help protect the Kindle from bending and heavy damage. Again, if you are looking for a way to protect your Kindle from dust and scratches this a perfect case for you."
5,House of Fara,The product and service was excellent. They are very prompt on their delivery. The wainscoting is of an excellent quality. Each bundle is individually wrapped to prevent damage.
4,Good introductory book on PDE,"This is a fairly well-written book on PDE. I find the examples to be quite good, esp. if you want to see how mathematical theories are modelled from physical reality. The excerises are fairly well and there are answers in the back. Only compliant is that it is not very mathematical rigourous."
1,Poor choice of text,"This book was a very poor choice due to the weak examples and ambiguity of the exercises. It is not often clear what the exercises are looking for, because of the vauge nature of the questions. The examples do not even come close to providing adequate information to complete even the simplest exercises. The lack of a solutions manual shows what I believe to be the authors lack of genuine concern for the students. He should either remove the ""Elementary"" from the title or produce an adequate solutions manual."
2,Frustrating order of instruction,"Reading this book was a very not satisfying experience. Haberman starts off the book without any general statements about PDE's. Instead, he begins by analyzing the general heat equation. Throughout the book, he uses this equation as a starting point for new material. However, he never really makes clear how techniques work for equations in general vs. how they work for this specific equation. For this reason, while reading the book, I'm not sure that I've really learned any general techniques for solving PDE's or if I just know a lot about the heat equation.In a similar vein, while his writing style is pretty clear, he arbitrarily puts off proving or even explaining certain concepts, saying they ""will be studied further"" later. He'll mention certain concepts and say that their nuances will be explained later; it's never clear how essential the unexplained information is to the topic."
4,An Applied Math Text for PDEs,"Haberman's book clearly explains how to solve various kinds of PDEs and does provide insight into the meaning of the techniques and solutions. It is a good applied math text and those who are looking to use the techniques for other pursuits will find the book useful. It is not a math text, and may lack ""rigor"" for those who want it."
5,Great,My kid loves it - everthign she had been looking for and for mom at a much more reasonable price.
4,Nice set,"We have had several tea parties with this set, like that it has a basket to keep it in when not in use, the napkins are a cute addition"
5,Granddaughter Loved It,"My granddaughter immediately had her two friends over for tea, and they had so much fun pouring and making conversation. The set is quite tiny but still usable by 7 year olds, the holder not sturdy or efficient, the pieces seemed pretty sturdy, so far nothing has broken."
4,Love it,"Great set, pretty design, not tacky, durable and is going to make a GREAT gift for a little girl I know. The wicker basket it comes in is fairly OK and I am grateful it came with a basket to store it in. Will buy again and again for every little niece present I need. Highly recommend.The cups are not too small and the little pink gingham napkins are super cute."
4,Great Set!,I purchased this item on sale so I was very happy to see that the quality is better than I expected. I was afraid that it might be too small but it's perfect size for my 5 y/o girl. Her 2 1/2 y/o brother enjoyed playing with it as well.
4,"Cute, little set.","This is a cute little set that has everything you need. The basket is a good idea, but not practical for storage once you take it all out of the packaging. Our daughter loved it, though."
3,"Nice, but","Bought this for my soon to be eight year old granddaughter. She loves it. Dishes are nice quality, but as most have said basket has no inside to safely carry dishes once they are removed from plastic!"
4,Tea Set,I think the tea set is great and my daughter loves it. We have already had several tea parties. The one thing I would change is the flimsy plastic that the tea set sits in. I just assumed there would be something sturdier to hold the cups and pot in place. The plastic has already started to bend and tear and we have been very careful when taking the set out and putting it back in.
4,Perfect Gift,I ordered this for my niece for her fifth birthday. I love the design and it is a perfect size for her. It is great because she can play with it gently and it will also be a keepsake for her as well. I think my niece is going to love this!
4,Tea set,"It would be nice if the set came with a spoon for the sugar and a tray. Overall it's a nice set, and the basket makes for easy storage."
3,Tea party,We read the reviews on this product and the issue of the plates seemed an issue. We tried them anyway and they are really too small.
5,Best Tea Set,This tea set is adorable and the best one I have found for the price. The size is great and it is very good quality. The basket is also good quality.
1,It's not about RHEL4 (it's mainly RHEL3),"Everything gives me the impression it's like they polished up the/a RHEL3 book.But it's done a very poor way.The fact the practises don't differ much between RHEL3 and 4, is no excuse. Using a beta version is hardly avoidable when you write a book to publish shortly after software release.To write a book for the desktop user (lot's of GUI indeed) is a quit good idea in fact.This 'Dummies' glitch production does not prevent me from buying others in the series.In fact right now I'm enjoying a 'Dummies' book about SOA and it fulfills my expectation.If there's going to be a RHEL5 book, Mr. publisher, please don't make the same/similar mistake.If you want to know more about RHEL4, take the Negus book e.g.Because the title doesn't cover the content I rate this book with 1 star.For what it does content, it could earn an extra half star.Regards,Han CoumansVietnam"
4,Quick Hot Water for Tea or what ever you choose,"My wife truly enjoys hot tea. We usually put a cup in the microwave for 3 plus minutes to get the water hot enough... while it does the job you also get a cup that is very hot and hard to hold. This unit heats faster and dispenses directly into your cup. Our only complaint is it will not take large coffee cups. Other than that it is a great unit and why gave it four stars. This should be an easy fix by the manufacturer.... we will see. As always, the shipping and delivery of the unit was handled by Amazon without any surprises. Amazon provides very good pricing, selection and I will be back."
2,Ouch,"Too short! I know people said it before, but I wasn't trying to fit a Travel mug under it. The opening to put a cup under is only 4.5 in tall, and the dispensor nozzle dips down lower. If you hit the nozzle with your cup when you are putting it under, the unit will start to dispense. If the water was already heated, then its a good way to get a nasty scald.The good thing is that it heats very hot very quickly. The bad thing was that it heats VERY HOT."
5,Happy user,"I have used the Sunbeam Hot Shot for several years, and love it. You can boil water faster than a microwave....less than a minute compared to several minutes. I have given the Hot Shot to friends and relatives as well as high school graduates, to take to college. I use mine for anything that needs up to 16 ounces of hot water....instant coffee, tea, oatmeal, cream of wheat, grits, etc. Keep it clean and it will last you a long time.If you decide to give one as a gift, include a Pyrex measureing cup to go with it."
4,Mine died 2.5 years after purchase,"This is a great way to heat a small amount of water relatively quickly. Mine started giving off a very unpleasant smell today, so I tossed it. It is cheap enough, but I wish it lasted longer. We have used this on average 5-10 times per week over 2.5 years."
1,Hot shot water Dispenser,"Usually I am very happy with items I order from Amazon but not this time.I have used the Sunbeam Hotshot for many many years,and needed a replacement as the one I have is very old.This one was put together wrong and the water only drains out as a trickle because the part that is supposed to lift in the pot WON'T!If I could get my shipping paid I would return this thing,but to send it back will take half of the cost of the hot shot.This is the first one I have ever had like this,and have used one since they first came out,but our local stores don't sell them any more,so ordered one.Very unhappy!!!!!:("
3,Convenient but not hot enough without modification,"This is great for making coffee with my Aeropress. It's faster and less fuss than the microwave. However, as delivered (and I've had two of these), it only delivers water at 175 degrees or so. I like 195 for making coffee, so I had to modify mine (no warranty for me, I assume). If you disassemble it (a little tricky and it's easy to break the wires for the indicator light), you'll find a thermal switch on the bottom of the pot. A bracket holds the switch against the pot. If you bend the bracket so that the switch is further away from the pot, it will take longer for the switch to trip and the water will get hotter. Then you're faced with putting the thing back together again. Still, I'll give it 3 stars because, after the modification, it's great."
2,A cheap little device,Sunbeam 6170 Hot Shot Hot Water DispenserCheaply constructed. It gives the impression that it will not last longer that the 90 day warranty.
2,I'm in Hot Water,I've had this Hot Water Dispener for a couple of months and it's still keeping me with hot water however the light on top stopped working so can I give it a great rating ....not
1,Died after only two months,"I had an older Hot Shot that worked for years. Hoped to love the new one as much, but it was not as well made and stopped working after only two months."
1,Broke in a Month,"When it worked, it worked great. The cheap plastic button you push down to dispense the water broke in a month though. Now I have to open the lid and dump the water into my cup. Big pain and I spill it all over. I believe it has a warranty through the manufacturer for a year, but by the time I ship it to them and go through the hassle of it, I could have just bought a new one. Not happy with this purchase!"
5,"Like it so much, we bought two!","We have a Hot Shot that is at least 15 or more years old that we received for a Christmas gift. We love it so much that we bought one for my Mother-in-Law for Christmas last year (2007). They love it so much that they mentioned getting another one to use at their summertime camp home. So we bought it for my Father-in-Law's birthday in August, 2008. So now we are a 3-Hot Shot Family.It is so easy and fast to use, and if you have an electric stove, the Hot Shot also saves on the electric bill. It is great for a quick cup of tea, coffee, instant hot chocolate, or any other beverage that is made with hot water. I would recommend this product whole-heartedly."
5,Hot Shot for Seniors,I bought this product for my 93-year-old mother (to keep her away from the stove) and it works great. She has no trouble using this and it saves her from burning up pans when heating her water for coffee and tea.
2,only lasted one year,"I bought this as a gift in Dec 08 and it already stopped working by Nov 09. User did everything right, according to instructions, but it just stopped performing. What a rip off!"
4,Useful and money saving,"This is a great product. I had one years ago and then shifted to heating water for tea in the microwave. My last microwave had a short life and when I replaced it, I bought another ""Hot Shot"" for heating water to take some of the use away from the microwave. The hot shot is quicker, the water is the perfect temperature for tea, and it saves electricity. I'd give it 5 stars if the water drained faster after it was heated. This is a great graduation gift."
4,"good product, needs to be taller","I was looking for an electric teapot when I found this on Amazon. Great little product, the 16 oz is perfect for what I use it for (instant soup) but I agree with some of the other reviewers... it needs to be a bit taller. I use a 16 oz cup... but you can't fit a 16 oz cup in it to get the water. So i have to use a 6 oz cup to transfer the water. That is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. The water gets piping hot very fast, and has been a blessing. Only had the unit two days, but have had several soups already (my systems cause me to have a limited diet... anyone wants tomato soup, I strongly recommend the Victoria Inn brand)Buy this item... when I get my home office set up, this little beauty will have a prominent place on my desk."
5,Handy little energy saver!,I really like this little Hot Shot. I had an electric kettle before and was looking for a new one when I found this. It takes up a lot less room on my countertop than the kettle did and it is super fast. It boils water for a cup of tea in 30 seconds and it is really boiling. Just make sure that you place your cup directly under the spout or things can get a little wet. I bought one for my son and daughter-in-law who are heavy into recycling and saving energy and I would definately buy another one for myself when the time comes.
5,great purchase,"This is the third Hot Shot I have purchased, and it was for my daughter-in-law. I have absolutely no complaints about this product. The initial purchase is still working, it just lost its top cover, so I know the inner mechanism lasts over 10 years! I use my Hot Shot twice every morning. The key to repeated immediate uses is to fill with COLD water. The only suggestion I have would be to make it taller so taller mugs can be filled with more water."
3,"Ok, product but won't last long","pros: it's what it does, to boil a cup of water in a minute or so.cons: boiled water tastes like plastic. material is mostly made of plastic so it won't last longI'm returning this product because now it is broken and wont turn-on, i have the option to replace it but because of the taste of the boiled water, i decided to return it for a refund."
5,Hot Shot is COOL!,"Nice little water heater for coffee and tea. It's fast, compact, and dependable. Have been using it for about three months and am happy that I purchased it over the many other types of appliances available."
4,Does what it says,Does what it says. Not high production value - but cheap and does what it claims to.
3,Nice little machine...,"it works very quickly and the water is very hot. The only problem is that the water does not come out quickly and I always feel like I'm pushing on the tab too hard and it will break. It's nice if you want to make a quick cup of coffee or tea, but make sure it's a short cup as there isn't a lot of space between the bottom on the water area and the footplate."
2,Unhappy,This product did not work at all....and I gave it as a gift. so I am not very happy with it and don't really know what to do.
2,diappointed,"I received this Hot Shot water dispenser in excellent condition. However, it can only heat 2 cups at a time, and you can barely fit a normal size mug under the water dispenser. I have to use a tea cup and pour it into my cup/mug. I am disappointed. It does heat the water quickly and is nice and small if you want to display it on your countertop all of the time. I would not recommend."
4,"Works great, but","As I stated in the title, the but is ones I used in the past have failed due to a diode(?). I did take a couple apart and got one to work again. It is not worth the effort. When they work they work great. I use it to make tea and hot cereal all the time. You can't beat the price, so if it fails after 6 months I can live with that. The latest one has been working a long time. Maybe they fixed the problem. Enjoy"
1,"Ouch, buy something else!","If all you are looking for is an appliance to heat up water to boiling, this product can do that.If you would like to fit your travel mug under the water spout or not get scalded by the steam escaping the top of this unit then buy something else.The product could be made better by changing the following items:1. Make the unit taller so it will fit travel mugs.2. Have markings in the water container to let you know how much you have added.3. Make a tighter fitting lid to prevent the heated steam from escaping the unit from all sides.4. Make the base heavier so it is less likely to tip over during cup insertion and removal."
5,Hot Shot Hot Water Review,This works great we use it in our breakroom at the office and I liked it so much I bought one for home. Very nice product and I would recommend it.
2,"Cheaply made, less than a year old and barely heats","I bought this so I could take my old (over 5 years old) to work for tea and such.This one is cheaply made - the plastic bends as you press the dispense button.Since making proper tea requires a rolling boil, it is useless to me now.It never got the water to a full boil ever, but lately it has a funky plastic odor and the water is barely hotter than my hot tap water.I'd recommend finding an older model or buying something else entirely."
5,Great little product,"I bought this for my boss who loves hot tea at work. We have had it in the office about a month, and he uses it several times a day. He loves that it heats the water up so fast. He has had nothing but good things to say about it. Good Product. Works really fast. I do wish the cord was just a little longer."
4,Hot shot,"I had a hot shot in my kitchen for years and I used it daily. I ordered a replacement since I needed black (old one is white). As usual it is a perfect tool to make quick hot water for a cup of coffee or tea. And the Amazon service was outstanding since I encountered a little snag.I highly recommend the hot shot and also recommend dealing with Amazon, they are so customer friendly.Thanks again for your help in solving my problem.Respectfully TA"
5,Compact & fast,I've had a Hot Shot at home for many years. Bought this one for the office to share with everyone. It's very compact and does the job quickly.
5,great appliance,"I don't like a ""one job"" appliance, but the hot shot is different. I use it all the time for coffee, tea, instant soup etc. It's the 3rd one I've had in the last 25 years."
4,Great for kids and adults,"What an easy way to heat up water. Great for hot cocoa, instant soups, or tea.No burning your hands from nuking a mug. Just add water, heat and dipense.Great for kids. Only gave 4 stars becouse you can only heat water in it.But still a bargin."
5,Great invention,I love this product. I had one years ago and was looking ofr another one for a gift and found it with ease on Amazon. I can't believe that other companies have not come out with the same product. It's perfect for a quick cup of hot tea or choc. Great!
5,PERFECT for my dorm room,it's quick. it's easy. it's effortless cleaning. i love making hot tea many times a day in this efficient little gadget.
3,Meh,"Used it for a month now maybe. I have not used it everyday, but the times I have, it heated the water well enough.I'm a month in now but it leaves these stains on the inside bowl. Not so pretty now..."
4,hot water dispenser,"i got this hot water dispenser after our old one broke ... i like the new desighn, although the opening of the space for a cup is shorther and there is the risk of pooring hot water on your hand...works great so far...fast way of getting water for a cup of tea..."
2,2nd time owner. Disappointed because of the plastic taste,"I owned one 10 years ago and it was great. I decided to get one again because I am a big tea drinker of expensive Taiwanese high mountain tea. I am so disappointed with the new model because the plastic taste is so strong that it completely changed the taste of my tea. I have been cleaning the unit with vinegar and baking soda and now the odor is about 50-60% less, but I can't accept any weird taste in my expensive tea!. If I can't fix this in a week then it is going back to Amazon.This product will heat up water fast but don't get it if you can't tolerate weird taste in water."
3,Mediocre compared to past Hot Shots,"I had one of these several years ago after falling in love with my Aunt's. The previous Hot Shot was sturdy and there was plenty of room to slide a coffee mug under the flow. I knew from reading reviews that the quality of this one was not what past Hot Shots have been, but this is ridiculous. It feels like it's going to fall apart if you put too much force on the button, and some of my regular sized coffee mugs won't fit under the spout. That's crazy! I'll hang on to it because it will do for now, but I will definitely reconsider buying Sunbeam again. Is every product (not exclusive to Sunbeam) turning into junk? Every company sacrificing quality for quantity? SMH"
4,Hot Shot Water Dispenser,"This was purchased as a replacement for an older version. It works well, heating one or two cups of water in just seconds, only negatives are the construction and the dispensing valve. The body has been made with much less rigid plastic than my original, not really a problem but the dispensing valve requires significant force to open far enought to get the water out in a reasonable volume. This results in the body flexing, again not really a problem just a comparison to my older model which was more rigid and had a dispensing valve which required less force to operate.Overall this is an excellent device and much more efficient than heating a kettle full of water.Order fulfillment was flawless and delivery was ahead of schedule."
4,Super hot water heater,I have had four of these so far; very economical water heater... They last for a couple years with many reloads of water every day so are practical.....
5,What a Great Product,I have told so many friends about this product and it was hard to find the black model which matches my kitchen. Great service and quick delivery. Would definitely order again!
3,Sunbeam Hot Shot,"This is a great time and energy saver when you need a cup or 2 of boiling water. Only 1 negative but it comes into play every time I use it: Unlike the older model, the cup area is too short for very tall mugs, and when dispensing, you can't tell when a mug is full because the top of the mug is too close to the dispenser. If you need that functionality, try to find the older model... it's taller and white."
2,Dispense Lever failed,"Unlike other low-star reviews, mine worked for awhile before breaking. In my case, the plastic ""dispense"" lever failed when it got fatigued through use. I too had one of the previous versions that worked forever. The new ones are more cheaply made and seem to fail at a higher rate. I'll buy from a seller who will easily accept a return, and I'll keep my receipt. I'm hoping someone builds a competing product that will remind Sunbeam to include some quality in the mix."
1,sunbeam 6131 hot spot,"Ordered 2, neither one worked. Cut off valve leaked & would not hold the water. Think it was the shipping packaging that damaged the valves"
1,Hot Shot not so Hot,"I used to have one of these and have been looking for one for awhile and was looking forward to getting the Hot Shot because it's so convenient. Tried it on a cup of water and it worked fine. Added a second cup of water for it to heat and the water all ran out onto the counter. The little stopper in the bottom of the unit didn't spring back like it's supposed to to seal the drain hole. It's useless to me if that spring doesn't work, so I sent it back. Where is the quality control, Sunbeam?"
5,"Great value, great product!","My last HotShot lasted over 10 years so let's hope this one, with new styling, lasts even longer. I'm a Mom on the go and my HotShot is my lifeline to get my tea in the morning before I bolt out the door...."
4,Hot shot,"Have used the Hot Shot for years. Have a small re-usable filter that fits in my cups, so I can make tea, coffee, hot choc., and many more things faster, and with less elec. usage than microwave. Just wish it was taller, as most tall mugs today won't fit under the dispenser."
5,another feature,I use this almost every morning to heat water for my coffee mug before I put fresh coffee in. I live in a cool climate and this way my coffee stays hot alot longer. I love this appliance.
3,Not like they used to be,"I had bought one of these units years ago and loved it. My old one was rendered useless when I put milk in it, instead of water. I'd had it for so long that I had forgotten that you can only put water in this unit. At any rate, I decided to buy a new one. The one I purchased does the same job, but is made much more cheaply that my old one. I guess that's what happens when you buy something that was made in China (and what isn't these days?). It is a very handy kitchen tool to have for someone who wants a quick cup of tea or instant oatmeal."
1,Big Problem,"Unfortunatly I had to discard this item. Everytime I used it their was a burnt rubber smell, and the heated water had a bad taste, even when I used filtered water. I would recomend ordering the more expensive model in white. Its cost is in the mid $20.00 range and has none of these problems. I think it is because it uses a metal tank to hold the water rather that a plastic material used to the cheaper model."
2,Spend more money for a better model,"It heats water find. The size is nice. However, the dispenser is aweful. You have to push so hard on the gray dispenser that the entire unit bends when full of scolding hot water."
1,Cheap and junky,I'd had my previous hot shot for almost 10 years. I decided it was time to retire my old one and get a new one. This new redesigned one was made very cheaply- not solid at all - and lasted only 4 months before it just stopped working completely. I am very disappointed and will not buy sunbeam products in the future.
1,"Great idea, cheaply made","The Hotshot that I received worked really well for a few weeks. But in less than 1 month, the lever that you push down to dispense the water had broken beyond repair. Too bad... good idea, but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,"Very nice, but not as sturdy as older models...","This is my 3rd hot shot. First one is an older model and is way more heavy duty all the way around. I use it a work and it is probably more than 10 years old or more and used every day and still works great!Then I got one for home, a newer model newer design. NOT as sturdy or heavy duty. Plastic base supports ""flex"" when you push dispense button. Only lasted about 3 years, then heating coil burned up, (NO I didn't turn it on empty!)Can't find old model anymore, OR anyone else who makes anything similar, so I bought another new one anyway. It is VERY convenient and fast!WISH Sunbeam would go back to old standard!"
4,Generally very pleased,"I got tired of having to microwave water for tea at work, so I bought the Sunbeam Hot Shot. Works better than I'd expected. Specifically, it makes water hot enough for tea (not coffee though) and it does it pretty quietly, which is great when you're working near other colleagues! If it were up to me I would have added a water gauge somewhere on the device and designed it so that you could put mugs taller than your standard sized ones under the dispenser. It cost me about $15, so I really can't complain."
1,"handy, but porr quality","I purchased model 6142 which looks exactly like this model only mine came with a red bowl. Not very handy, since it didn't have a handle and got hot quickly when filled with water. It leaks from the dispenser spout unless I pull up hard on the gray dispensing button after I dispense the water. This model also broke within a month of light usage (1-2 times/day). It just stopped working in the middle of heating some water. It was never dropped or abused, so it is definitely a quality issue. We had a hot shot when I was growing up and it lasted for years and years of daily use and we had 3 tea drinkers in the house at that time instead of just one. I would not buy this product again, even if it is convenient."
3,Not as much of a hotshot as it used to be,"We've run through a number of Hotshots over the years. Although this one didn't cost much more than the one we used in the 80s, the diminution in quality is obvious. Don't know if it has to do with being made in China. The plastic casing is flimsy and the water tank never fully drains, which means that I have to pick it up to empty it if I don't want standing water to sit in the machine. On the plus side, it does heat up water fast."
4,Simple and fast.,"I bought this for my grandmother for $15. It has an on/off switch with a light. After the water is heated, the light turns off and the unit, of course, turns off. The unit heats water to boiling in ~2 minutes. A little bit of steam is released from the unit, because the water gets so hot. The water does not release fluidly, but quickly enough. It takes up very little space and weighs little. There has been no issue with the flavor of the water, but the water is used immediately. This product is cheap and serves its purpose well."
5,Very Convenient We Use It Every Day,"I have purchased several of these over the years, and have used them at home, at the office and at my mother's house. Great of instant coffee, instant oatmeal and grits, hot chocolate,etc. Love It!"
4,Hard to turn on,"I have owned several of these with no problems. The one I received is very hard to turn on. It takes alot of pressure on the button for it to engage. Maybe after more use it will not require so much force. With that said, I still love this product!"
2,Defective auto shut off,I've owned several of these. I'm throwing my current one away and ordering another. My current one heats the water to boiling and then continues to heat for 10-15 seconds after that while my water boils away as steam. My other ones shut off as soon as the water reached boiling.
5,Hot Shot Water Dispenser,"I had a kettle before and it rusted on me, I was going to purchase another one until my friend mentioned the Hot Shot Water Dispenser. When I received it tried it write away... WOW!!! That was a fast heating item. The water was hot in seconds and had my tea and hot chocolate fast. It's a great buy!!! I recommend the Sunbeam 6131 Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser!!!"
5,Great for preparing baby bottles!,"An unlikely choice for baby supplies, but this has worked fantastic for warming water for baby's bottles. It gets way too hot on its own but if you do a half & half mixture of the hot shot water to regular room temp water its perfect. And it heats the water super fast, (in mere seconds)wh ich was the downside we found on our other option of bottle warmers which can take up to 5 minutes."
2,"Convenient, but cheap","If you're debating between the Hot Shot and a hot pot, go with the latter. Much more versatile and not as low quality. Constantly pressing on the dispenser tab puts stress on the back arm, so much that eventually, the top part tilts down toward the front. This shifts the water basin from being level, and you get a nice pool of water that collects in the front, which won't come out when you use the dispenser button. Plus, you can only use it for up to 16 oz of water at a time, and your cups have to fit in a small space. Go with a hot pot, definitely."
4,Hot Shot Hot,"This is a cool little gizmo that gives instant hot water. I'm a tea drinker and a mother of oatmeal eaters so it comes in handy on crazy mornings when time is precious. My one issue with the Hot Shot is it can give the water a plasticky taste and that new appliance smell. I leave it open when not in use and it seems to solve the problem. I also sent water through it a few times to ""break it in"". It's handy and if you find yourself filling the kettle a few times a morning it's worth the purchase!"
4,Sunbeam Hot Shot,"Great item for heating small amounts of water in a hurry. The hot pot takes up very little room on the counter. It heats a cup of water in about 60 seconds. Does a excellant job for cups of soup, tea, or any instant hot beverage. Also a good way to pre-heat water that will be used for cooking a small amount of pasta. Good Value."
3,Hotshot,The transaction went well with no problem and the order was received quickly. Just hope this Hotshot lasts longer than the last one.
2,Works great but cord contains lead!,"This product does work great. It heats water to boiling in under a minute BUT according to the label on the cord, it contains lead! There is no safe level of lead for human exposure. ANY amount of lead can cause lead harm to the body. DO NOT BUY!"
3,heats water fast. size however is issue,"works to perfection. heats water FAST. however, size is an issue. you can only fit a small glass under it. huge issue. oh well. i should have read further into it."
3,New design,"My old Hot Shot has served well for many years. Excellent for a quick cup of tea etc. Weak point was plastic pins for lid hinges, They eventually broke. New machins works as well, a couple of improvements, but with very similar capacity, it is larger, more bulky,requires more storage room and does not allow dispensing nearly as rapidly. Old design only needed to beef up the hinge. It is hoped this review comment gets to Sumbeam engineering, and is not intended to disuade the purchase of a functional product."
1,Sunbeam Hot Water Dispenser,I love it. Heats room temperature water in about one minute and 15 seconds. Very simple to use and doesn't take up much counter space. Sent one to a friend and he loves it to. Surprised they don't sell these in stores.
5,Fantastic!,"Works great, have no complaints! I recommend it... My large Starbucks mug fits underneath it, which is nice, I just have to tilt it a bit to get it out from underneath because of the spigot thing. Other than that, great little item to have at one's desk, or in a kitchen. Small and compact, just what I needed for my desk!"
1,AWFUL!,This product is terrible. I didn't even get to use it once! As soon as I put my mug underneath (or attempted to) I realized it was too big to fit! Why is there no off button? It seems ridiculous to have to make sure I have water in it BEFORE I plug it in. It's going right back in the box and going back! Horrible product with limited usability!
2,Cheaply made.,"This does seem to heat the water very well and, for me, it does heat it very quickly, however, the button that depresses the water seems like it will break after a few uses. You have to press very hard and it seems like it will damage the button very quickly. Also, the water seems to drip out very slowly and doesnt empty the chamber. I didnt have an older one to compare it too but dont think I will keep this one. I would love if them made a quality unit. Why does everyone resort to cheaper materials and quality. Truely disappointing."
3,Dislike material of the interior container,"This product is great, however there is one problem. I don't like the material of the interior container that heats up the water. After the water gets heated up, there's a chemical taste in the water. The older model doesn't have this kind of problem. I have tried getting rid of the chemical, but it doesn't seem to work because the interior container is made with such material that produces such chemical. I had to discard this product after 2nd use."
5,Can't do without,"This product is awesome! I have one at home and at work. Faster than the microwave. I use it to heat water for tea and coffee as well as for instant rice, potatoes and any recipe that calls for hot water. Holds up to 2 cups at a time. I highly recommend this product!"
3,Not as good as it used to be,"I purchased this Hot Shot to replace my old one which had begun leaking from it's seal -- after a little over 21 years of use! I mean, that Hot Shot was tough! This one seems to have a fatal design flaw. The vessel that holds and heats the water is pitched farther out and visibly bends down as the water is dispersed from the chamber and does not empty completely. It leaves about a tablespoon of water in the chamber so I have to lift up the entire unit to fully empty it. I cannot say I like this version as much as my old one."
2,hot shot pot,We have had these for years. Size is great. Heats up water quickly. Turns itself off. Love the hot shots.
5,Works perfectly,"I've been using this for almost 6 months and I'm completely happy with it. It works just fine, it looks okay (it would look better if the warning sticker on the lid wasn't stuck there), and it produces one cup of hot water at a time. I have no complaints."
1,Sunbeam 6131 Hot Shott,"I have been using these hot shots"" for moe than 20 years. The last one I got was leaking and the temperatue never got past warm. I sucessfully returned it and had no dificulty with that. I would not recommend this item even though I purchased many of them in the past. Is this because this new one is made in China. No more Sunbeam for me"
3,"If careful, it will last at least 18 months with daily use.",I bought two of these. One is at my work which I use at least 3 times a weekday. The other is at home which gets abused much more by a male teenager that doesn't know his own strength. It's used at least 3 times a day but broke after 18 months. The water release lever broke.This device is very useful but the design needs a slight improvement to make more durable.
5,Hot Shot is worth the price,"This is a great product. It is so convenient for making a bowl of instant oatmeal or noodles, and perfect for tea and cocoa at the office. It works much faster than a microwave and you can leave it on your desk. The water actually comes to a boil, but when you dispense it, it is not so hot that it burns your mouth. Nice looking design, too."
4,Make Coffee,My husband and I use it every morning to make hot water for our instant coffee. It works great and is very fast. We love using it very much and highly recommend it.
5,Great for College!,"I love my hot shot!I'm in college, and am always in a hurry to get to class in the morning- so it's a great way to get my morning coffee in a rush!It's quick, easy and low-maintenance, and automatically turns off so I can run out the door as soon as I dispense the water into my mug!I'm recommending it to all my busy friends!"
5,I really like this thing,"I purchased my Hot Shot 18 years ago. I've used it several times a day on every day since. It still works like new. If it ever breaks down, I'll get another in a flash."
5,Sunbeam Hot Shot,"I had used this product many years ago, during my instant coffee days, and then gave one as a gift to an elderly friend for making her tea (after she had burned up several teapots). Now I've once again purchased it for my 96 year old mother - for her morning tea. It is a great solution for the elderly who forget they have a teapot boiling dry on the stove or aren't strong enough to lift an electric teapot. The Hot Shot boils just the amount of water needed for a cup of tea and when the water has come to a boil it shuts off automatically. It is easy to dispense and the user only has to wait for a minute for the water to be ready."
3,Small Cup?,"Good heating, but it only takes a small cup to retrieve the hot water. I use an oversized cup and had lots of trouble getting the hot water out. It always spilled."
1,Second only to instant,Hot water in no time = quicker than any other method of heating hot water. Makes about 2 cups at a time. Indispensible kitchen appliance.
1,product is not the same as the last one that i purchased,would not recomend at all the original model made tea in a basket that came with it or coffee using pods in aseperare adaptor that also came with it
1,Disappointed,"I thought this appliance would be like my mums, hold a couple of litres of water, but only heat and dispense a cup at a time, saving electricity. To my horror, through reading the instruction booklet, it only holds a cup and requires to be dried thoroughly after each use. It can't be re-used straight away for a second cup, as this would effect the thermostat. Why would anyone want an appliance like this ... I can now see why it is not sold in Australia. The cost to return this item would be greater than my initial outlay, so now what do I do with it ... I have a brand new appliance I'll never use nor give to anyone else."
4,"Hot, Hot, Hot Shot","Pros: easy storage, easy to use, heats quickCons: The water is exteremly hot, like boiling hot.Overall, the product is great and serves it's purpose very well but make sure to let it cool down for awhile first before consuming your drink."
3,Love and Hate the Hot shot,I love how easy the hot shot works!! It heats the water very hot in a very short time. Some things that bothered me with the Hot Shot were - 1. You can't fit a larger mug under the spout. 2. After a while the inside of the Hot Spot started to ship off and get in the drinking water. I had to throw mine out because of this. I'd like it even more if this didn't happen.
3,Works ok. May find it somewhere else cheaper.,"Works good. However, I just purchased this from Superfresh on sale for $6.50. Also, was disappointed that my favorite 12oz. cup would not fit."
3,sunbeam hot shot,"This model of Sunbeam hotshot does the job of heating water to boiling, but it seems to take quite a bit longer to do so than our previous hotshot."
2,Cheaply made and standard mugs don't fit!,"I originally purchased the Sunbeam that came with the ceramic bowl, but returned it since standard mugs (above 4 1/2"") will not fit under the spout. When I researched this one, I assumed it was a little taller since the product dimensions given are larger than the previous one.Guess what!!Same problem... how stupid Sunbeam is when you can't get a standard 16 oz mug under the spout; only squatted ones. All they needed was a 1/2 "" more height. Stupid! It also very cheaply made (what else is new). And it barely makes it to a boil. It gets to 175*-180*. The only thing I will give it is that it gets the water hot in a minute.Your better off getting the Rival Hot Pot. Holds 32 ozs., has a temperature control, gets the water to a rolling boil AND is almost 1/2 the price.This thing is a piece of crap."
2,Crap Crap and more CRAP!,"This item is such a piece of junk. It's flimsy and cheaply built. The cord is very short and caused sparks in the outlet every time I plugged it in. The item came as ""new"" but when I opened the box and took it out of the plastic bag it was covered in dust. It does heat the water in about a minute but it is kinda loud and not something I would be able to use in a financial setting type office. The release to pour the water into the cup was not very sturdy and I felt like I was going to break the thing just by trying to get all the water out. It's not something I would want to leave plugged in either due to the sparks it made when I plugged it in everytime. I would NOT buy this again!"
4,Quick hot water,"This unit provides a convenient way of preparing a cup or so of very hot water in a short period of time. Useful for beverages and cooking. The only problem is that the water is too hot for safe use in a beverage applioation. I have used just a half cup of water in the unit and added cold water to make a safe, comfortable cup of coffee."
5,Sunbeam Hot Shot Dispenser,"This is a must have kitchen appliance. It heats water faster than the microwave. Great for that one cup of coffee, bowl of oatmeal or hot tea, anytime you need a cup of hot water. I use it all the time. I've had one for over 2 years and it's still going strong. Great gifts for friends and family."
3,not as good as the old model,"The older (5 years ago) model was faster, drained better and seemed better made. BUT it does work and if I had not had the old one I would be OK with it. AND I use it everyday."
4,Dislike making tea in a hotel coffee maker,"I take the Hot Shot with me when I travel, because the in-room coffee makers always produce hot water contaminated with coffee oils. This latest design works just fine, but it does take up a bit more space than is absolutely necessary, in my suitcase. Still, it is an efficient and reliable way to make a great cup of tea in 1 minute. Of course, TSA will almost certainly search your luggage."
4,Sleek black Hot Shot,"Great looking black Hot Shot. I've had many, and this one looks great. The only thing that is difficult to get used to is the Heat switch is now on the top rear of the water resevoir. I keep pressing the lever on the front left where lever is on other models, only to have the water dispensed accidentally. Maybe it's me and that you can't teach an old dog new tricks."
2,it IS fast but an electric kettle is much better,I chucked mine because I decided it wasn't worth the instant gratification. It's too one-note.
5,great little appliance,I bought this for my office. It works great. You put water in it and in less than 2 minutes you have a cup of hot water.
5,Love the Hot Shot,"I probably use the Hot Shot more than any other appliance except the microwave. A million years ago they had a model which was just the heating pot rather than on a stand (it had a little handle on the side and you poured the water from a lip on the other side) which was easier to pack for traveling, but the stand model is easier to use.You can save a lot of money while traveling with a water heater and stuff like instant oatmeal, Cup o' Noodles and other instant convenience foods. The Hot Shot heats water so fast it really isn't a problem heating extra water for ""cooking"" for two."
4,Works great,I've been really happy with it. It does its job. I just wish it came with a cup to use for filling and emptying.
2,Leaks Alot!,"We owned one before which worked great, so we ordered the bigger one in black. It leaks all the time - right out of the box. So everytime you put in water, it starts to ""leak"" and you get a puddle. If you leave it filled with water ~ it'll leak A LOT and leave a mess. This never happened with the one we used to own. Real disappointed. Not sure if I'll buy another. I got it from Amazon, great price, fast shipping, but unit itself must have changed the design somehow as we've had nothing but problems."
3,Serendipitous,"Sunbeam Hot Shot Beverage MachineI bought this item for other than its ordinary purpose, but it works perfectly well for what I intended to use it. I use it to warm the water that I put in the water tank of the Waterpik water jet dental cleaner. Waterpik suggests using lukewarm water with the system, but it takes a lot of cold water to pass out of my faucet before hot water comes out. So to conserve water, I thought of getting this unit to heat a small amount of water that I then add to the colder water in the Waterpik water tank. It works fine because it only takes about 30 seconds to heat about 3 to 4 ounces of water. I save water, I save time, and the warm water feels good coming out of the Waterpik jet tip."
2,Not so satisfied,The unit heats water but never tastes good. Not sure why. The big issue was price. I paid over twice what I have seen in local stores!
4,Sunbeam 6170 Hot Shot,My Sunbeam Hot Shot arrived on time and in perfect shape. I would order if this company again with no hesitation.
1,Falling apart after a month,"I bought 2 of these items about 5 weeks ago to try to save water and electricity when I make my tea. The dispenser tab has broken off of one and the other doesn't always heat the water to the proper temperature. My aunt has an old one that still works fine so, obviously, quality is no longer a concern of this company. Too bad for me. I spent money I don't really have to save over the long run. Boy, is my face red to have been taken in like this.Jean Louise"
1,Flimsy Device,"Really flimsy, handle that releases the water broke in less than a month.Before that it was a decent product, quickly heated water to near boiling, usually ~190F coming out. Still cannot give a one month product more than one star."
5,Susan from Bradenton,"Great product! I have had 2-3 of these in white going back 10 plus years. Love them, they are great for heating up water (only water, nothing else) in a jiffy. Great that they now come in black!"
5,Quick and Easy,Saw this at a friend's home and had to have one.A quick way to heat water for my morning cup of tea.Quick and easy. Recommended !
4,Almost as good as my old one...,I really like how the power button is on the back of the Hot Shot (as opposed to the old model I used to have) but I am disapointed with the dispense button. You have to hold it down quite far to release the water but it feels like it is going to break off. I had read other reviews about this issue but thought I would buy one anyway because it is such a handy appliance. The water resevoir is quite large (larger than the old model?) and holds enough water for a large mug or travel mug.
3,Not for someone with Arthritis,The button to activate the water heating process requires you to use a lot of pressure with your finger to push the button down. The person whom this device was intended to use is unable to use it; which makes it pointless for my application. Otherwise the unit functions as it should by producing very hot water in a quick amount of time.
1,Trash,"Another piece of junk from China! I had the original model in white that was made in the USA, and it lasted twelve years, and worked perfectly. This unit lacks the quality and features of the older model, and leaks as other reviews have indicated. It also does not heat to the temperature as the original. Stay away from this product. The Sunbeam name means nothing now."
1,not as good as the original,"This new hotshot is not as good as the old one. The old one has the 2 buttons in the front . I searched and searched and could not find it. So I ordered this one. I got it and had it a week and it broke,,the dispense button on the front broke . I returned it ...still cannot find the original, it is discontinued..will keep looking. this one is not of the same quality.."
2,It taste of plastic. Period.,"I wished it didn't and I have come to realize it isn't just me because others (many) have said the same thing. Tonight I did a taste test with water from the unit, the microwave and heated in a pot. Of course, all things aren't equal; however, this unit definitely tasted of plastic. It was far worse when I first got it but I kept using it hoping it would stop. It smells of plastic and taste of plastic and doesn't seem to be going away. So, I'm looking for alternatives, which is a real shame because this thing heats 16 ounces of water faster than anything I have tried."
5,This is the best lego ever,"This is the coolest lego ever in my opinion. This is a huge vehicle and can crush about anything. It comes with 1 aerial trooper which is a clone with a jet pack, a regular clone that can look out with his binoculars, a comander with a desert shoulder cloth thing and 2 pistols and he is covered with a yellow stripe, and a green scout trooper, I guess for camouflage, 2 battle droids with blasters, and mace windo the jedi knight with light up lightsaber. I personally like the old lightsabers better, because mace windo cant move his arm or hand. And it come with a speeder bike for the scout trooper, also with a very cool turret. The whole tank has lasers and blasters on it. A bunch of sides open up to put the guys. Last but not least are the wheels that change position to go with the terrain. Overall this is a great lego and I advise you to buy it, because u'll have a blast making it and playing with it, a 5 out of 5."
2,Falling apart,This stinks! It falls apart 10 minutes after you put it together. I get frustrated! Don't buy this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![I recommend the Wookiee Catamaran and Clone Scout Walker].
1,ILL ILL ILL!,this set is horrible. it doesnt stay together .not worth 90 fricken DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
5,The best star wars episode III set,"This thing is FREAKIN AWSOME !!!!!!!!!!!!! i got this set when it came out and it's amazing. The extra touches like the scout trooper with his speeder and commander cody are nice.Thou there are a few bad things about it like the mounted turret on the top falls off constantly and Mace Windu its nice that he comes with a light up lightsaber but that makkes him unplayable with because his head is way too loose, his hand with the lightsaber in it can't spin (...). Still even with thoes 3 problems it is still a must have for any lego star wars collecter or any lego collecter!"
2,Carefully consider other options,"I have used this machine for 1 1/2 years. The spindle sander is very poor. It is located so close to the other stations that any large object cannot be sanded. Mine stopped ocillating after about 6 months. The sandpaper slips on the sleeves. It cannot be tilted so any beveled surface cannot be sanded. In effect, the spindle sander is close to worthless. The disk and belt sander are ok. A better route is to get a Jet spindle sander & a separate belt/disk sander - even if you have a small shop."
1,Dont buy,"Hardly a marine system. The cord used for the microphone dry rotted after one season. The ""revolutionary"" clamp used on the speakers broke after a two months. The sound is nice but should be considered ......junk."
3,Needs to be updated,"There's a lot of good information in this book...for 1998. Breast cancer treatment and survival has come a long way since then; this book should reflect that. Also, was surprised at how much stuff they covered that *wasn't* post-treatment. A lot of what this book covered was in other books for the newly diagnosed and those going through treatment -- I wanted more about actual life after treatment, not more recaps of breast reconstruction.Disappointing."
3,"Practical, more information than most doctors provide","This book has detailed information that can be overwhelming for those that have diagnoses that are not very early breast cancer. However, if you want to know everything and have a lot of information, you will appreciate this book for all of its content.There is a lot of useful information. If you don't want end of life issues at this time, don't go there with this book, because it covers a lot of territory. For me, parts of this book were scary."
3,new treatment options,It has great basic information about breast cancer but not up to date on the new treatment options. Breast cancer treatment options change almost daily with new research coming to light.
3,It was OK,It was helpful to read about others having the same thoughts and feelings but not enough of what happens now for me
3,Tom Mann's Volume one Bass Fishing,"Overall, it was pretty good. Some things were kind of hokie and there wasn't enough time spent on river techniques. Most of the topics covered bass fishing on lakes in Georgia, but the principles seemed sound."
5,Oscar Brand Gets It Right!,"There are some funny songs in this collection. I am partial to ""Every Inch A Sailor"" since I first heard that album when the crew of my ship played ""Quantanamo Bay"" over the ships intercom as we were steaming out of the harbor after an 8 week stay at Gitmo. You favorites may be based on what branch off the service you served in.Brought back a lot of memories for me!"
3,Amusing songs,"The songs on this CD are quite amusing! The only Oscar Brand recording I had ever heard before I heard this CD, was his ""Sports Car Songs"" album, which was given to me by a relative when I was just a kid. One bit of information lacking on this CD that I would have appreciated are the release dates of each of the 4 albums that are on it."
5,A Good Guide,This book is a good place to start to set up the framework necessary for financial security. Financial planning basics are presented in a straightforward manner with an overlay of application of those principles to same sex couples.
1,Not impressed,I got this book for my boyfriend thinking that he would stop spending money. He got all caught up with emailing Todd and took a turn for the worse.
4,UPS Review,Great UPS product. I use it for all my HD TV and audio systems. The only complaint is that the cooling fan is too loud.
5,PLANNING A TRIP? READ THIS FIRST!,"Whether you're an avid traveler or a dreamer, this book has something for everyone. Plan your trip online or simply look at places across the world-no matter what, this book makes navigating the web easy. I especially loved the sites on currency conversion, ATM location, subway navigation, the translators, and the speed trap detector. It was all so useful and had so many sites I had never dreamed of. Thanks for making my travels so much fun to plan!"
2,Check It Out From Your Library,"The book is your source to a plethora of additional problems. Yet don't expect the exam problems to be similar to those you find in this Schaum series. You might find some of these problems extra strenuous or over-simplified. For all the major functional groups, the book does provide lots of practice problems in reaction products, reactivity, and stereochemistry. You might need to cover up the solutions which immediately follow the questions. Students should foucs on soloving the mechanism-type of problems from textbooks before looking at this book. Check this out from your library!"
4,Very Necessary for Doing Well in Orgo,"Every orgo teacher is different (obviously), but without question, all orgo students need to make this a staple in their studying library. It offers more questions than most generic orgo textbooks that help you beat the concept into your head. Also, it offers helpful explanations and step-by-step processes for a lot of confusing questions. Spend the money!"
5,Don't listen to these people about changing,this product does exactly what it says it will change color it changes with heat...
5,Always get it when possible,"I love silly putty. I've never heard of one that changes colors! A few years ago, I mixed up pink, blue, and some other color (I can't remember it right now) and got purple silly putty!!! I would say that if you have never had silly putty before, YOU MUST GET ONE IMMEDIATELY!! I wouldn't be able to live without silly putty! I'm going to buy this one!!!"
1,AWFUL,"I've had this before. Many years ago I had the yellow to orange changeable...it changed quickly and was very cool. I just purchased the purple to pink kind...it should be re-named to darkish pink to slightly lighter pink!First it was completely stuck as pink, no matter what I did. I put it in the freezer, in a cup of icy water...I tried everything, and it stayed pink. I left it overnight and it is a VERY slight shade darker. When you play with it for 15 minutes it becomes lighter again, and you can only tell when you place a piece of it next to a cold piece. This is ridiculous."
1,Doesn't change color,"It is silly putty, simple as that. I bought all 3 colors, none of them will change color. Save your money and buy the regular product because this Silly Putty doesn't perform as advertised."
1,Just like regular Silly Putty,"We received in the mail the green color change Silly Putty, but it did not work at all. No matter how long we play with it, heat it up, it doesn't change at all. Waste of money if you want for color changing properties. My kids were disappointed. Don't pay more than you would for normal Silly Putty."
2,Not Much Change,"I can find the Original Silly Putty in the local dollar bins, but I thought special color-changing Silly Putty would be really neat, and worth paying extra for. I was wrong. It barely changes color at all. Our kids still enjoy it because it's Silly Putty, if I had know, I would have saved the money, or maybe bought more of it from the dollar bin."
3,Pretty good action romp starring Bruce Lee,"Bruce Lee: Return of the Legend stars the legendary martial artist in a plot that is straight out from one of his own films. Meaning that the plot bears little importance as a whole, and instead the focus is on some bone crushing action. Playing as Bruce, you take on baddies and lurk around getting from one point to another. That's pretty much the basis of the game, as there really isn't a whole lot to it. There are some stealth areas thrown in for good measure, but these missions aren't very well done, and the stealth aspects aren't really implemented all that well either. However, the game looks pretty good, and for a GBA game there is a great assortment of moves to utilize as well. All in all, for what it is, Bruce Lee: Return of the Legend is a solid side-scrolling action romp, and the fact that it features Bruce Lee makes it worth playing alone."
4,A rare glimpse into the mind of a brilliant writer...,"Ray Bradbury has perhaps been the most author who has most influenced my own writing. When I saw this book, I had to have it. What a wonderful glimpse into the mind of a man who can turn language into music, who can make prose sing like poetry. From the first time I checked out one of his books at the library--when I was around nine or ten years old--he taught me that it's possible to transcend the the borders between genres. What a wonder to get a glimpse into the years that make up his life. The only reason I put four instead of five stars is that I'd like to see a true autobiography, in his own words, that looks over the eighty-plus years he's walked the earth."
5,K.M Acevedo,I'm very happy with this product. Katt Williams is the funniest man on the face of the earth!!! That guy is straight guts!!!Received very quick also. Will do business again.
5,Support support,"I am a 43 yo female Filipino American, married to a white wall street businessman. We have two kids. Yes, I am eccentric. Why am I saying this? Mr. Williams appeals to all, understands that which is in all of us, and makes us happy through laughter.Entertainment industry, pay heed. If I could tell you the number of people who discuss his humor that don't fit the expected stereotype, it would be legion; and their diversity is palpable.His humor makes me happy. I bought his CD's off the Amazon link from youtube. I did this to support him and his art. To try to let him know that we won't forget him and hope as soon as he gets better he thinks better of us, his audience. And haters, keep haten, that lets us know that we are prevailing."
5,DOES CURSING MAKE U FUNNIER,"I watch the show but I wonder how strong would katt Williams comedy be if he took out the cursing. That's how I measure the strength of a black comedian. Over all Katt did make me laugh. Funniest line was ""B"" we don't know you like that, refering to Hillary Clinton on how assume that black people were going to vote for her. Buy this it will make you laugh. Alright Miamifilms.net is out of here."
4,Hilarious,"I thought this DVD was hilarious!!! I love this dude's comedy, like for real, for real! Seriously, I've never been let down by any of his work! He's like an everyday guy that's funny! It really doesn't seem like he's telling ""jokes."" He just seems like that super funny friend, who is very observant, funny, and has a lot of freaking energy! Good stuff!"
2,Alittle Disappointing,"While I am a HUGE Katt fan this DVD was alittle disappointing. The constant repetition about the ""haters"" and looking out for yourself were annoying and were less and less funny as the show went on. The jokes/stories ARE funny but they are very few and far between in this show. Alot of good material seemed to have gone wasted and he was all over the place.Maybe I am being too critical and expect more but Katt seems to have gone backward from the ""The Pimp Chronicles Pt. 1"". Its follow-up ""American Hustle The Movie (aka Katt Williams: The Pimp Chronicles Pt. 2)"" was not as good as Pt. 1 and this DVD seems to have taken an even further step back.Katt seems to be preaching to the audience about the ""Haters"", Stand-Up should be Stand-Up and not a personal pulpit against the ""Haters""."
2,Pass on this DVD,"... or just Netflix it. This was pretty disappointing. Im a big Katt Williams fan based on his other 3 DVDs... and this one is clearly the worst of the bunch. Katt is trying to project an uplifting message throughout the entire set rather than individual jokes; which is what made The Pimp Chronicles and American Hustle so great.He seems to blab for the ENTIRE set, not even giving the audience time to laugh. A few things were funny, but I wasnt laughing out loud like Pimp Chronicles or American Hustle. Fairly tame content too coming from him. You could almost show this set on daytime cable.If you plan to buy this for X-mas, do whoever your buying this for a favor and get any of his other DVDs."
2,I huge disappointment,I have to say...Katt Williams is probably one of the funniest guys I have ever seen...but this performance has to be the most disappointing one I have seen yet. It honestly looks like this man is on crack. None of his jokes make sense and he is twitching all over the place. I have no idea what happened but this was not what I wanted to see...
4,Katt Williams is too funny,"I have now watched this over and over and can't get enough. Katt Williams is very funny. Not sure if I really needed to blu-ray version, but either way I really enjoyed it."
5,"Its funny, funny!",Love this Blu ray title! Katt williams is a comic genuis! Very happy with over all transaction!
4,Funny,If you liked The Pimp Chronicles then you'll love It's Pimpin' Pimpin'. Live in DC with today's topics.

4,MMmmmm,This book is great! Simple and easy to prepare meals. I bought this book for someone who didn't know how to cook and I kept it for myself. I like the simplicity of it.
3,Pretty But Not Durable,"I purchased this set because I have several Winterberry pieces I set out for the Holidays. In years past the burner covers were very heavy metal. I used to purchase the Yorktown as that set is my every day dishes and accessory pieces. This set is very thin and acquires dents easily. As I said, the set is very pretty but I am disappointed with the quality. That is no reflection on the seller. The seller was prompt with the shipping. It is a reflection of the times that many things are not manufactured to be lasting quality anymore."
1,Pfaltzgraff cover set,"I have a gas stove, and there was no mention of how narrow these covers were. I cannot use them."
4,Good,"It was a good book for its need, and though it is a bit dry, it isnt nearly as bad as I had expected."
1,Don't Be Fooled!!!,"Buyer beware! The cover and title of songs on this cd would lead you to believe you are buying a compilation of Native American music. Perhaps the makers of this collection were inspired by the ""world of Indian spirits."" It is the only thing I can think of that has anything to do with Native American music or spirituality. There is absolutely nothing on the cd that sounds like traditional or even non traditional Native American music. If you like New Age, highly synthesized, elevator music then this is the cd for you. I would have given this cd 0 stars, but I had to rate it with at least one star."
5,Basic introduction,"It's interesting -- I have the book from 1848 called ""Lives of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence"", and this book is very similar. But this book has line sketch illustrations that grab your attention. Roughly two pages of text for each signer, and two illustrations each (on average).This book does not really capture the bravery of these men as well as the 1848 book did, and its section on Ben Franklin is nowhere near as inspirational.Still, this book belongs on your child's bookshelf. They can use it as an overview to decide which founder to study next. Also includes the text of the Declaration of Independence, which I am having my kids memorize this year."
1,Awesome book!,"Anyone who wants who's frustrated that the schools don't teach American history the way they used to should buy this book! If you want your school-age child to know about those who signed the Declaration of Independence (some of these I've never heard of) this is a very informative & interesting book. Comprehension level is approximately 9 years old & older, good for middle school age."
3,The Signers of the Declaration,"This was an enjoyable, albeit short, read. It contained a lot of rarely presented facts about the people behind the Declaration of Independence. I wish there had been just a bit more of a story line. Occasionally there was a bit of a story, but it wasn't all tied together ... in my opinion. I liked the drawings of each signer, and wished for some more visuals.The book was in good condition and was shipped in a timely manner."
5,Old MAC 1010 Repair parts,"I have had this MAC 1010 chainsaw for about 30 years and it has worked fine until the drive sprocket broke. I was afraid that parts would no longer be availible, but I found this #65370 replacement sprocket on Amazon, received it quickly, and it works like new again. I am very pleased how this all worked out.Ron"
4,An important book on the complex Han-Dynasty,"Michael Loewe does an attempt to unveil the mysteries of the Han-dynasty. This is not an easy task, but Loewe succedes in an wellordered presentation of the ideas, mythes and thoughts in the magnificient Han-dynasty. Many of the fundamental ideas and imaginations in the cultural history of China comes from this period. It was also a time when different strands merge togther - all this Loewe tries to explain in a well written manner. Chapter two and three are important contributions to the religious thought - not only in the Han-dynasty, but also as a firm ground for later religious ideas and behavior in China."
4,Well written; tied the myriad details together well.,This book was well written. It used previous details and accomplishments as well as other characters previously introduced well. The plot was a continuation of an on-going conflict and seemed to transition Admiral Brim into a new phase of more responsibility and a posssible end to his overt career as a line commander. I'm looking forward to the next book in this series.
5,Wilf Brin gets nailed...,"Plenty of action and a couple of new characters you will really, really, REALLY hate. A lot. Wilf, like usual, does his job and does it well - but gets back-stabbed. Read it - you'll see.This was the first book in the series I read, and hunted up the previous 6. All are well worth the read. One warning - the publisher has no plans to renew the series, even though Bill Baldwin wants to - maybe a little pressure from fans would help!Update: Bill Baldwin has a new publisher. His books are re-released in expanded versions, and a NEW novel is due by 2007. Wilf will be back!"
3,Continuing the story,"I've been a Helmsman fan for several years, and I did enjoy this story very much but only because it continued to tell about the character. I found the shift from Baldwin's regular third person to the first person bothersome, and I also found that when he was recalling the past, the writing would slip back into the third person. The story was good, but I think it could have been developed a little bit more."
2,Steelers rubber cord mis-shaped and pulls hair...,"I just got this today and tried it on. I found that for some reason there are springs in the back near the latch. These pull and remove your hair, especially if your hair goes past your neck. The other issue I found is that the rubber cord doesn't lay flat on your chest due to being packaged. I am hoping that hanging it up for a while will straighten the cord. It isnt't worth returning. The only good thing is the pendant seems nice ant the coloring is good."
4,my opinion,"i mam still a teen ager when it comes to horses. i love throughbreads in paticular, if you have any other stroies please send me the titles and where avalible inexpensivly.thanks"
2,Leave the series as it is!,"I don't know if he's just trying to make money off his father's famous series, but I think he should've come up with his own idea for a children's series. The Black Stallion books that Steven Farley is writing stick out like a sore thumb."
5,Wilderness for ALL,"I have not yet finished this book/journal but find myself trying to read a few pages daily. RLP (Richard L. Proenneke) took time from his daily chores to write thousands of pages, documenting his life in the Alaskan wilderness.I escape the daily grind of my 9 to 5 by living out in the wilderness with RLP. So far I have climbed mountains,made friends with various animals,hiked in sub zero temps,sewn buttons on and patched worn clothing,cleaned campsite liter left by hunters, and on and on I could go all done thanks to RLP sharing his life with me through his writings. I highly recommend this book to anyone who ever dreams of escaping into a less hectic life. Thanks RLP !!!"
5,"More Reading From One Man's Wilderness: The Journals of Richard L. Proenneke, 1974-1980","This entire series is absolutely the best. Every single book and dvd meet all of my expectations and more. What a fanstastic story about a marvelous adventurer.I continue to go back and read the books again and again, and watch the dvd's repeatedly as well."
5,Very Interesting,I found it very interesting and informative. didn't have much time to read it though as it was a gift I had to wrap.
1,"Thanks for nothing, Raid!","Three weeks after moving out of our rental house, we came back to do a final cleaning and discovered the basement carpet infested with fleas. I guess with the pets having been absent from the house for so long, they'd gotten desperate as we'd never seen fleas at all when we lived there. We spent three days vacuuming to make sure we got as many fleas out of the carpet before we bombed. We used all three of the Raid bombs in the basement (only room in the house with carpet). We came back, vacuumed and washed the carpets. Never saw any dead fleas but we sure saw live ones jumping on our socks. We vacuumed more and used a carpet cleaner and put down one of those flea glue traps. 2 weeks later we get an email from our landlord that the place is infested with fleas. These bombs didn't do anything. Don't waste your time or money."
3,its an ok product,the only thing we didnt like is that we had to remove all food items and cover EVERYTHING up. but thats on our part for not researching more before buying.
5,"Works,well But?","Raid makes two types of deep fogger.This one kills adults, but no affect on eggs.YOU need the Max solution, witch does not ship to CANADA,.........."
3,seems ok,"seems to have done the job, just disappointed in price. one of the drawbacks of online ordering is that same product can be significantly cheaper in store, but most time i believe the reverse is right but not in this case."
4,"Fog seemed to work, but was in my face",I used this product and found it effective. Seemed to last a long time. But the fog blew into my face so I picked up another product called Spray Close Spray Extender and it worked well to keep fog away. Found it at english gardens
4,"Spies: Risk, Danger & Double lives","This is a good movie on the subject of spying which covers a lot of old ground ( ie: WWII) to fill up space. Still, there were some revolations in that part of the movie that were new to me and for an amature historian like me, that's rare. The present day research was very good. This movie is worth the money."
4,Well structured!,Good value for money and nice tips and advices that you will get in expensive courses
3,They hav better,Definately some great songs here with speedy doin most of if. Jimmy on just a few tracks. Other albums hav more of the chemistry
5,"Calling All Coyotes, Vol. 1","Great DVD, must have if you are getting into Coyote Hunting. Now you neee to get Vol.2"
4,DVD,"WE had seen this video before through Netflix and enjoyed it and knew our friend would enjoy it, so we bought it for him for his birthday. He hasn't opened it yet, so don't know what he thinks of it yet. I was tickled to find it at Amazon.com"
1,Not So Incredible,"Don't waste your time or money on this book. Search engines are far more useful. The book is very shallow when it comes to sites with exercise variety. Beware. Most are out to sell products. Be persistent in searching, and you will find better sites."
3,The Shaped Note Singing is TOO Polished,"I was first introduced to shaped note or sacred harp music by listening to the music in the movie Cold Mountain. ""I'm going home"" recorded at the Liberty Church in Alababma is an extremely powerful song. I immediately bought Southern Journey, Vol 9 & 10- sacred harp music recored by Alan Lomax in 1959. Its almost too crude to enjoy with a lot of people singing off key but there are some really good songs on them too. I also bought ""In Sweetest Union"" recorded in 1999 again at the Liberty Church. THAT is a great album that has real church-goin singers, mostly on key, singing with all of their hearts. That is what is missing from Rivers of Delight. No one is off key and I just don't hear the heart that makes sacred harp music so powerful."
5,A beautiful collection,"The Green Lantern Archives Vol. 1 is a beautiful, affordable collection of the impossible to find Silver Age origins of the second Green Lantern of Earth, Hal Jordan. Seeing Hal's earliest adventures shown in this way is a good introduction of his character and his supporting cast. At a time when Hal is resurfacing in DC continuity (he's been dead two years, his Lantern status revoked for 5) in Green Lantern (with the current GL), Legends of the DCU, Green Arrow, JLA: Year One, and Brave and the Bold, this volume is even more of a must-read for new and old fans alike. I look forward to seeing any further offerings from DC involving any of the Green Lanterns and the GL Corps."
3,Does NOT hold DS system,Stylish case but I thought it fit the DS itself when i ordered it! I was fooled. As far as game cases goes i think its very cool although a little pricey. Fortunately i plan to cut the inside flap out and turn this thing into a DS case
3,Blade Collection: 4 Film Favorites,Ignore the TV show and watch the cinematic trilogy. Snipes is weonderful not just because he sells this part physically (which he does with an earthy grace) but because of his uncanny ability to portray a narcicist who has momentary but short-lived flashes of the larger world around him
3,Don't waste your time with the 4th movie,Don't waste your time with Blade 4. The first three are great but the fourth is a disaster.
3,Blade Collection: 4 Film Favourites,"I found the first three films to be brilliant. The action and delivery were exactly what I would have expected. However, the fourth film was total crap. Not only was Wesley Snipes not in the lead, making continuity of the character unbelievable, but the guy who took his place couldn't act to save his life.Even the storyline was implausible. I turned it off after only 30 minutes and went and read a book.If they're going to continue with sequals of a characterline like this they need to keep the main character's identity true. Another words the same actor. Otherwise can it."
5,Really Very Good,"Although aspects of this trilogy can be a little silly, these movies find just the right balance between recognizing their own limitations and transcending them. Well done. Take special note of the really excellent soundtrack on all three."
4,Easy way to enjoy a mini-marathon,"The TV movie (House of Chthon) is not really up to the same level as the earlier three releases in my opinion. However, even if it was just the first 3 Blade movies the value is still there, and this is a great way to add the Blade movies to your collection without making your wallet cry out in abject horror. I tend to think of that last one as more on par with some of the extras that get tossed on traditional DVD releases..... not something I need to see all that often."
3,"If you like blood & vampires, you'll like these; otherwise FORGET IT","I got talked into buying the Blade set of 4 not knowing what to expect. I did not enjoy watching them, but heck, I don't like vampires so what was I thinking? I thought #s 2 & 3 were the best; the 4th one was awful as they had a different actor who just pretended to be Wesley Snipes. Wesley Snipes was the best thing about Blade; you can't make another movie without him."
3,A bit disappointed...,"I have been using Rene Furterer other products such as the nourishing leave-in conditionner and their RF80. Those products are absolutely amazing. I guess I expected the same result with the oil. Actually, the oil does not affect my hair one way or the other..."
3,Candle Snuffer,"The top was beautiful, nice and heavy as well. The handle seemed skimpy compared to the weight of the top part. It was a gift I gave someone, so I don't know about performance."
3,Another Cuban release plagued with studio quality problems,"Los Van Van make some very complex music, like everyone else said here. When that music is not recorded in a state of the art studio, you get something like this. Imagine the complex drummer, congas, and guiro, all having an echo, all playing at the same time.Same with the singers. Yes the rhythm is infectious, the lirics are witty and original. But due to the sound quality I recommend you try other releases from them such as Chapeando, Llego Van Van, and Aqui el que Baila Gana. Those others have modern studio quality, then if you really enjoy those and must have all Van Van albums, then get this one and love with with its faults."
2,Quality has gone down,I bought a Century heavyweight gi a few years and it was better quality than this one. My old one is a size 5 and I lost a lot of weight. I am now 5:6 and 155 pounds. The 5 is a tent and the 4 is way too tight. I sent the two size fours that I ordered back. BlackBeltShop was great to deal with. They didn't charge me the re-stocking fee that was part of the original agreement.5 stars for BlackBeltShop but only 2 for Century for this mediocre quality dogi.I bought a Tokaido on eBay for $115. It is the difference between a Rolls and a Ford Maverick.
5,Great Gift for Any Girl,It's a perfect gift for any toddler girl. It's the famous Cozy Coupe that has been around for years and always a favorite for any toddler except this is aimed at girls with the purple and pink design and decals and a cell phone to boot. Purchased as gift for my 2 yr old niece and she absolutely loves it! Her mom says she stays in it for hours and even has to take it inside the house because Sara will not part with it.
5,Love It!,We just got ours today for our 17 month old daughter and even before we had a chance to put it together she wanted to sit in it! The wheels roll so smooth and she just loves it! She also loves phones so the phone that comes with it makes this car even better!
3,Poor Construction,"I returned the first car I purchased due to poor fit of the post that holds up the roof in the front. That post did not fit good and the door popped off easily due to the poor fit. The 2nd car I received was a little better, but still had a poor fit. The door did not pop off though, which was good. We did think the included cell phone and stickers were cute. Overall, the Step 1 car we have for our other daughter is built better."
1,"Bad chose, crappy customer service","Bought this for my Grand daughters first birthday. When my daughter recieved, top wouldn't fit. She tried everything. When looked closer top to small. Wouldn't fit because too small for care design. Bad part. When tried mutiple times to contact coustomer service, no one answered. When they did finally answer, was told that was old design and would replace it. Why do they send car if has old design problem? Have yet to see the new car arrive. We will see ahen that happens. Very disappointed. Grand daughters first birthday over, and no toy car. Had ordered 3 weeks in advance to have on time. Its been three weeks since contact customer service and still no car. She won't remember, but I will. Have bought alot of little tikes products through the years. Not sure if that will continue."
4,Fun toy!,"We bought this coupe for our 16 month old daughter who loves all of the riding toys now. The sitter has one of these and all of the toddlers fight over using it, so we wanted to get her one of her own. It took a bit to assemble, but in the end, it's all well worth it. The cell phone we received was green though, not purple like in the picture. Otherwise, this is a great toy!"
4,How Sweet!,"This is the cutest little car! My daughter is 18 months and lovs this. It has a place for your cell phone, and even comes with one. She just loves all of it. It is 100% girlie!"
2,Meh,The North Korea one is pretty awesome because it's one of the only real documentaries which show an American getting into the country. The rest are pretty much worthless.
2,Waste of money,"Guess what? The third world is filled with guns, drugs, and prostitution, all fueled by desperation. Who knew?I started paying attention to VICE after reading some more serious commentary by Gavin McInnes. However, most of what I have seen of Vice has turned out to be immature drivel. There isn't much that demonstrates more serious insight behind the ""comedic"" moments.This DVD was a waste of my time and money. And frankly, I think it was a waste of the Vice staff's time and money, too.One extra star for nice packaging."
3,We Go So You Don't Have To,"The Vice Guide to Travel is a unique compilation of short segments relating to Vice Magazines coverage of some of the most dangerous spots on earth. In a 60 minute whirlwind tour we are taken to Beirut to see a training ground of suicide bombers, Chernobyl to visit the deserted town, Bulgaria to purchase a warhead, the Congo, slums of Rio, the gun market of Darra, Pakistan and a lost colony of Nazis in Paraguay.While this is not great journalism it is an interesting watch. The segments are too short to provide much information and the extras are a bit bare but all in all its worth a rental."
2,umm...,"i'd like to give this a great review, but basically everytime anything is about to get good on this dvd, the credits roll...seriously, they went to the Congo and did nothing it seems...to search for a dinosaur?"
2,Blue Balled,"Well... I'm never really let down with Vice, however this video left me with that feeling as though I was blue balled. Why? Well I thought it was going to be someone informative or show so actual stuff but the whole DVD came across as a fake. They get wasted and chat with people and nothing seems to add up. I mean getting drunk and going to places is fun and all but I felt this movie just didn't pack any punch.vice... you have let me down with this one. Don't think I'll be purchasing another DVD from you in the near future but I will keep all your mags as they rule."
2,The Vice guide to... what again ?,"Was very excited to watch a bunch of short movies about traveling in dark and unaccessible parts of the world. Until I actually watch it .. took me not even 45 minutes, wich is a first disapointement. The research is very poor, the filming is done without consideration for the people watching, there's a critical lack of information and focus on every story... I'm telling you, go and watch a good documentary or read articles about those regions because you won't feel like you've learned anything after watching those 'movies'. To short, lack of research, lack of production continuity ! And believe me, I'm a fan of Vice magazine !Don't spend your precious money on this.. you'll be seriously disappointed ! That's what I would have wanted to read before buying this dvd."
2,DONT,"nice packaging and a nice idea arent enough to carry this half azzed rambling poorly produced unfocused underdeveloped poorly executed badly finished boring mess.Vice's writing always had this weakness: they start with a good idea, and ramble until they run out of steam. If they do any more videos, I suggest they hire professional TV producers to come along. Some of the ideas are good and its disappointing to have them lame out halfway through the bit.THis video is not gonzo its boring."
2,Disappointment,A cool idea but filled with short clips that don't really go anywhere. Save your money and watch it on youtube.
4,great green gas.,I bought this for my kjw m9 which btw is a great gun. this green gas worked perfectly with it. it has a great sound to it when it it shot i recommend this green gas
4,"Still good, just not this particular one",I ordered this along with an MK23 pistol and instead of receiving a UHC green gas bottle I got a King Arms Softair canister. It's still good and works perfect and is green gas but...still isnt the one I ordered exactly.
3,"Good stuff, kinda",the gas itself is awesome. I doesnt come with a nozzle to put gas into my magazine though.... no idea where to get one
4,purrty good,I got a WE hi-capa 5.1 and it is a gas guzziler. But this gas isnt gassy! Its purrty good! My gun is shoot fine and I like the gasprose-cheap-no conscons-non
2,problemed maybe just for mine but theres more problems,when you put in the gas this is normal but it leaks out all over your hands unlike propane and mine lasted one day untill i just got propane it just didnt really work for me it wounlnd fill up my mag very well so just get propane and an adaptor its easier to fill cheaper and you get to add your own amount of oil to the gas
2,TIP MISSING,"I received the can promptly, but the spray tip on the can was missing, rendering it useless. I know it was most likely bad luck, but a major inconvenience none the less."
1,Liers,"I ordered this green gas from amazon and instead I got King Arms Softair Gas. I don't care about this gas it is fine but I think I should be getting the exact product that I ordered, so i do not recommend buying this from Amazon if this is the type of green gas you want."
1,Dont waste your money,"Dont buy this, its just propane with silicone inside of it. I would recommend buying an airsoft propane adapter on Amazon. With this you can buy propane, which is MUCH cheaper than this ""green gas"". Trust me, buy an airsoft propane adapter."
3,bestek green gas????,I ordered this product but instead got ultra elite gg-10 competition grade green gas. This is fine but im not sure if it will work with te eg707 pistol that i ordered. someone help plz (evanlattanzi@gmail.com)
1,RIP OFF!!!!,DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY GREEN GAS!!!!!! YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY INSTEAD GO AND BUY A TANK OF PROPANE A PROPANE ADAPTER AND A BOTTLE OF SILICON OIL. 10X CHEAPER!!!!!
2,fragile,"i used this product for only a few days and the band snapped and became unable to use. The band was good for the days i used it but it wasnt tough enough to do the simple work outs i was doing with it, i would say these bands are a bit too fragile!"
4,Pretty good tape. Great price!,"We bought these to put on our trucks for identifying network cables and electrical cables. The tape works OK but it is not as good as Scotch Tape. It is stiff and hard to pull in half. it does not stretch like Scotch and 3M tape does but overall it is OK. Just do not expect it to be Scotch35 because it isnt. But for the price, you will be happy you got it."
4,"Not used as electrical tape, but worked for us","We used these to color-code boxes during a move. Worked well for our purpose, and for a much more reasonable price than colored masking tape."
1,cheap! made in China Crap!!!,$20 for this 10 rolls. the day i had to pull wires the adhesive is so weak or none. it would un-ravel in front of our eyes. we tried to use it but the tape would come off in the conduit and made a big mess. we had to stop work and spend $43 at homedepot to get the job done. lost half the day for 4 workers and myself. lost over $2k because of this cheap! made in China Crap!!
1,SAFETY CONCERN,"I purchased this lamp for my daughter's nursery and it looked adorable. After about 8 months of using both the lamp and the night light, I noticed that the plastic on the night light was starting to burn. This made me extememly concerned as this could cause a fire. Although Lambs & Ivy was very nice, replaced the lamp for me and gave me a new one, assuring me that all their lamps have been inspected, I remain very concerned and I have completely removed the lamp from my daughter's room. I think this lamp should be recalled."
2,BECARFUL WITH THE NIGHT LIGHT!!!,"THE LAMP... BEAUTIFUL, THE NIGHT LIGHT ....VERY VERY DANGEROUS...I HAD ONE IN MY BABY'S BEDROOM, BUT IT GOT SO HOT THAT IT MELTED THE PLASTIC CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE THAT SAYS PRINCESS ON IT... I RETURNED IT AND I GOT ANOTHER ONE THE SAME DESIGN BUT WAS GETTING HOT AS WELL SO I JUST DON'T USE IT ANYMORE AS A NIGHT LIGHT."
2,Couldn't change bulb!,"We loved this lamp at first. It is pretty enough and doubles as a nightlight, which we loved. The price is a bit steep if you ask me, but we were going with the whole Princess theme and decided to get it. After using it with no problems for about 8 months, the nightlight bulb finally burned out. We went to replace it by taking the back off and couldn't open it. No matter what we tried, the back was jammed on there. It was like the painted it shut or something. No way to change the nightlight bulb. So back it went to the store! I would have rated this higher except for that defect."
2,BEWARE OF THIS,"Although this lamp is adorable and adds to the princess theme of our nursery, we found a very shocking and upsetting problem when acutally using it. While using the nightlight function, I noticed the next morning that the hard plastic around the night light bulb was burning hot. It had a huge bubble and was melting through. This was so scary because it could have caught on fire. I have only been using the lamp for four months, and loved it until this; now I am thinking it should be recalled. This is not something that you would want to happen in your nursery where your little baby is sleeping! I haven't had any problems using the lamp part, so definitely beware of the nightlight! When I took it back to Babies R Us to show them, they were all as shocked as I was and were very apologetic."
2,Dont waste your money on this garbage,Both of my dogs were able to run through the barrier. If you like to bury trash in your yard then buy this product
1,This product will fail you. I can prove it.,"I have had to pay for new transmitters 8 times since 2008. They just stop working. After the initial warranty, Petsafe does you a favor and discounts the replacement cost to just under $50 a pop. I purchased the lightening protection, pulled out the sytem and placed the wire in buried conduit, and it still quit working after about 7 months. I call Petsafe and they refuse to let me switch the transmitter to a more robust one (they also handle the Sportdog brand). They say it is lightening or power surges or grimlins. I care not. The system is designed to be underground! Lightening hits the ground. The fuse does not blow, they system just stops working! Nice job guys. Way to treat a customer. Great product for Petsafe; it is like an annuity. Customers pay them every few months for a replacement product."
4,"Works well, but sometimes randomly goes off","This might be a problem with my wire/installation, but sometimes this thing freaks out and starts beeping randomly with all the wires plugged in, and when I unplug the power and plug it back it, it's fine for several more weeks. Not sure why - it's a minor annoyance. The dog knows her boundaries now, so it totally works."
4,Great item !,"When I bought it, I was a bit doubt whether I can do it myself. The item came with all instructions. Just followed and installed myself around my yard. Worked like a professionally installed. Just followed the book. It has also a DVD which I never opened."
2,Can't recommend,"I own the wireless version of this fence from PetSafe. It works. The wired version doesn't because it's too hard to install.I spent an entire afternoon digging a trench around my yard only to find out how difficult it was to get the wire into the ground. I could easily see the wire coming back out of the ground with a hard rain, which could be problematic when mowing the grass or otherwise.The setup logistics are also a pain.The wireless version is plug and play. Get that one if you're in doubt."
1,Beware of faulty dvds in this edition,"My copy of the DVD seemed to be missing 3 of the ""astonishing features"" :-( It had the main film The Magic Sun which is wonderful and the 5.1 surround mix is great but it only had the photo montage and one ""astonsishing extra"". My copy had 5 short apocryphal clips of some IMHO very bad rock music clips, these were not complete and looked like they got stuck on by mistake in the copy run I received. Make sure you get the real thing. I have told Caiman about this who said tell Amazon so Amazon is advised and Atavistic. Perhaps they will reply here and enlighten us all."
4,for crying out loud,"what more can you say about the statler brothers? they are americana to the hilt. i was first introduced to them as a snot-nosed college student watching Pulp Fiction. Tarantino must have resurrected about twenty careers with that one movie. counting flowers on the wall was the catchy tune that bruce willis was humming while driving into marcelus wallace. little did i know that these guys are legends, but ALL of their songs are catchy- kind of a barber shop quartet feel with bluegrass and country thrown in for good measure. there is an element of tongue and cheek which pokes fun at middle class life in all of its quaint glory."
3,Love's Old Country Music,I think it is very hard to try and make only one collection of the Statlers cause they had two different singers. Making them almost two different groups. They almost need to make 2 collection one with Lew and one with Jimmy. Not put some with Lew and some with Jimmy on one collection it almost don't work. Now maybe if they did half with Lew and half with Jimmy it might work but in this case they didn't do that. There is more with Jimmy on this collection than with Lew. They should have made it a half and half CD then it would be a nice collection. I don't think its right to favor one guy more than the other.
2,friggin cheap short term fun,"First of all the fact that the game has bad graphics does not help,and what do they do they make the game too short. The location choices were terrible I think they could take the time to make good locations. The attacks are bad. Hello? New Goblin and Green Goblin cannot throw pumpkin bombs and fly on their Goblin Gliders!!!!!"
3,Good and Bad,"First off this is not a game for those who have played Gears,Halo,Cod4 etc. This is a very linear not very new just a fun kid game for around 10 hours. I bought this game for 12.48, which to me is a reasonable price. After playing it, I would say this is good for around 10-20$, but beyond that its not worth it. The achievements are relatively easy I got 925. The game is extremely easy i failed one time, because i died fighting a boss one time. So basically if you see this is a bargain or if you have kids who like the Marvel series, then you should probably give this a shot.Proslegnth 10-14 not bad.simple (nice to have a break from the harder games)not soo violent(nice not to always play violent games too me)achievements 925 easy ones. the other 75 are harder.consrepetitivenothing newgraphics are nothing to write home about.overall 7.0"
4,cool spider man game,"the reason i gave it 4 stars is beacuse it's a fun beat 'm up game. if your a spidey fan you'll like it.it's no ultimate alliance but i think it's the best spider man game. i played the movie games they were all right,but i like how you can play the villians and use characters like silver sable ;black cat and prowler and so on . the graphics are good ,and the controls are easy.unlike the movie games were you have to collect tokens and track people down it's the same old thing . and the ultimate spider man was too cartoony . like i said if your a fan ,and you like beat 'm up games then it's a game worth getting."
2,"ok,but...","the plot is exciting enough, and the thought of getting to play with spiderman's worst enemies is cool, but the only thing you get to do is kill ""phantoms"" over...and over....and OVER! that gets tiring.after 4 levels of fighting phantoms you do get to fight in a boss mode against spiderman's enemies,but its exactly like fighting the phantoms.the graphics really stink."
3,VGA input is missing,I'm very much satisfied with the LCD TV. But this model is not having the VGA or DVI input. So it's impossible to connect with the PC without the external converter VGA - S-Video or VGA - HDMI. HDMI converters are costlier than the S-Video converters. I did lot of research but I couldn't find the right one for my TV. I don't have any issues with the TV apart from this connectivity.
5,Sharp HD TV,This is a great tv. I got the 32 inch and it is just right for the small space I have. Everything was as advertised.
5,Great TV For The Money,"I've had this TV for about 3 weeks now and LOVE it. Got a really great deal on it ($900) and it's a perfect size for the bedroom. Crystal clear picture even on non-HD channels. 1080 HD channels are breathtaking! Sound is perfect. Exterior glossy black frame is gorgeous! I agree with the other reviewer - remote is quite large...and a few of the buttons underneath a flip panel is confusing (took me forever to find the 'sleep' button). But, if that's the only complaint, I say BUY IT! Now I just need to buy the 42"" Aquous for my living room to replace my older Samsung HDTV. I will def purchase another Aquous once I save up for it."
5,"Sharp Aquos LC32D62U 32"" 1080p LCD HDTV",THIS ITEM IS GREAT. NO COMPLAINTS. a GOOD BUY AT $885 INCLUDING SHIPPING. BEST BUY SELLS THE SAME HDTV FOR $1399 PLUS TAX. I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS TRANSACTION.
5,An excellent TV,"I've had this TV for about a month. In that time I've watched DVDs, on air HD and DirctTV. The picture quality is great. I have found the sound quality better than I expected. It made old b & w movies more enjoyable to watch. The size is excellent, but slightly larger than what will fit in my cabinet. I could not find the 1080p in any smaller TV. I am very happy with my purchase of this TV. /cf"
4,good HDTV,I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She mostly watches DVDs on it. It is a fine set
2,"Malfunctioning, Repair process difficult","My Sharp Aquos LC32D62U was purchased through one of Amazon's sellers, and they dont accept returns on TV's. So I'm stuck trying to get my defective set fixed by Sharp. The set worked for about 1 day (looked great by the way), but then failed (1/2"" wide black line across screen and rest of screen blurry and with double image).Called Sharp 3 days ago to get it repaired. They said to wait 2 days for service center to call me. They never did. Called service center and they said Sharp never contacted them. Called Sharp and was told dispatch center closes early on Fridays. Told to wait 'til Monday to start from the beginning. So I'll be lucky if I get a call from the service center one week after my first call to Sharp. Lets see when they actually show up, and when my set actually gets fixed. I guess that is the risk you take when buying a TV set online. Buyer Beware... you may have a huge headache on your hands even though you spent over $1K on a TV."
5,Smart purchase,"I just won't go as technical detailed as the other reviews have. All I can say is that before I bought this tv, I did my research and price check for a while. Picture qualityis awesome, price is great, well built, no regrets."
5,Amazing tv but....,"This tv is amazing in every way but im having a problem and maybe someone could help me. When i watch a certain channel the display box that shows the channel number likes to pop up randomly, the one that is in the top right corner. besides this, im almost completely satisfied with this tv, if it only had PIP i would be blown away."
4,Excellent quality TV,"The picture of the Aquos from Sharp makes for a well defined picture with a nice viewing angle. The control settings on the TV allow for a wide range of options. Picture adjustment is first class, with audio configuration having a moderate number of options available. The different viewing modes allow for wide screen content to be viewed without side empty black space on the screen. The PC connectivity with DVI to HDMI is excellent and is easily configured. Built in speakers have a little trouble with bass sound that will cause a slight rattling but provide very nice HD sound. Gaming isn't a problem on this TV with the PS3 or XBOX 360. Finally the built in surround sound provides for an incredible viewing experience with movies with any home speaker system."
4,Perfect for a bedroom ...,Good pic ... perfect size for a bedroom. Delivered within two days of purchase. No problems encountered ...
5,A Great TV,"In researching LCD TV's there is a lot of info about 1080 pi not being necessary in a 32"" screen, but I would have to say that this is just a really great picture. Very easy to set up with Tivo, cable, DVD player, etc. Could not be more pleased with this product. I do not buy TV's too often, but will keep the Sharp name in mind for the future."
5,1080p,"This LCD flat screen 32"" TV is undisputable best among all. The picture is clear, colors are vibrant, reception of regular TV signal and display in wide format are simply superb. Regular videos upconverted to 1080p look simply stunning! Support of the HDMI, true HD resolution and of the 1080p standard make it the winner for long time to come. Design is pretty and simple, the sound quality excellent. Menus are simple and logical, there is really no need for setting up anything. All worked out of the box. The only thing I am missing is the BluRay video player..."
4,I was so wrong,I just saw the unrated version. I take back everything I said in my earlier review. The two girl/girl scenes sizzled! The Eros Collection is back!
3,Made me wanna' jump from the Hollywood sign,"Okay, it wasn't that bad. The storyline was paper thin and the actors were terrible. I've seen better acting on the Springer Show. Kim Dawson, who plays a femme fatale bent on taking over her husband's talent agency is gorgeous, as are the other female leads. However, the sexual action between the characters either never pans out, or is cut at the last minute. I'm certain the UR version is much more ""telling.""While I enjoy the Eros Collection, the girl-girl action is boring. It's too scripted."
2,Strange.,"I've noticed that in several Saddle Club books it's like the character's personalitys change completley. Does anyone else notice this? In theis book it wasn't just like Carole was jelous, her personality completely changed. In no other book was she at all like this. Like as soon as she heard a rider that showed alot was coming to Pine Hollow she immeadiatley went nuts, that's not at all normal. This book has some good points and I like it when Carole's coaching at Briarwood but it's allitle wierd and Carole's starnge new personality annoys me at some points."
2,ummm alright...,"Wow, i was expecting something much more...i think that the plot was solid and the idea was good but i got annoyed mor then anything at all of the missing parts...for one they tell you who dies...the actors are horrible...the black kid (nathan stephanson i think) acts like he's a 10 year old white kid, the killer talks to much and besides the one very gory part it was boring. like i said before the plot was good (in a hospital a ton of people to kill...but no there was 6 people to kill even if they kept the horrible acting the killer talking so much and they tell you who dies then if they had the hospital full of people like they usually do that would hav mad eht efilm ten times better...oh yea and then it just ends and you dont know what happned and you dont care becaseu it ended so abruptly."
3,SHERIFF FREDDY KRUEGER,"Did you ever think you'd see the day where Freddy Kreuger would play a heroic sheriff? Wait no more. Robert Englund has a supporting role as the sheriff in this average gorefest. Englund's sheriff watches as dreaded serial killer Jonathan Chambers (a creepy James Binkey) is electrocuted and hauled off to the morgue for his autopsy. Along the way they pick up a suicidal teenager (an effective Meredith Henderson) who is in the ambulance with Chambers and sees he is not quite dead.Once we get to the hospital (another one of Hollywood's deserted hospitals), Chambers goes on a killing rage to locate Henderson, whose body he plans to take over and continue his killing spree, apparently in some bizarre deal with Satan. Director Bob Keen keeps the tension pretty intense and even though the tornado conclusion comes out of nowhere, it does have a certain eeriness, with the predictable ""Oh, no, I'm not safe"" ending. It's not the best of its lot, but it's viewable."
1,Do not waste your money.,Boots no. 07 Stay Perfect lipstick (NOT)Does not stay on your lips at all. Do not waste your money on this. Please do not waste your money.
3,Not as good as I remember,"Enoch Light used the 'new' stereo systems of the late fifties and sixties to there max, flipping from channel and had great separation. But alas, on current systems he is a bit dated. The musical content is good and the songs are the best."
2,Disappointing!,"I hate to say this, being a long term enthusiast of Enoch Light but - first of all the disc is mono. Worse yet, it is vocals with not much background. It is so unlike any other Enoch Light productions it's almost as if someone else produced this. I have other of his discs with some vocals, which sound much like the Ray Charles Singers - and they are excellent - professionally produced, great harmony, and excellent song selection. I guess if this is the only ""bomb"" he produced, that's not bad!"
4,Good solid rock,"Stationary Traveller is one of Camel's best albums and, in my, opinion, Camel didn't match it until the much later, superlative offerings 'Harbour of Tears' and 'A Nod and a Wink'. Classic 80s rock."
1,"I love reading about the Holocaust, but...","I found this book extremely tedious, poorly edited, full of boring speculations and philosophical self centerdness. Am shocked at myself being able to say this about any survivor, but there you have it. I kept thinking, ""OK, now when are you going to get on with the actual story"", before realizing that it just droned on in this way. A much better book that I just read is 'A Jump for Life', a far more moving account and likeable woman."
3,Too bad...,"Be warned--if profanity bothers you, do not read this book! I'm sure Ms. Monsour was just trying to be ""real,"" but come on. Believe it or not, there ARE people who don't freely throw around the ""f"" word or the ""s"" word. Not one of them existed in this book, right down to the most minor character. Too bad, the plot was good and would have been just as good with 95% of the profanity thrown out."
2,Too many small details,"The story started off okay, but as it went on it got boring. Once again, another author who puts in too many small details. Paris came across as a weak, unable to make up her mind and a so-so police officer. It seems to me throughout the the book all she did was whine and feel sorry for herself and fall for every man within a few feet of her. I found the character of Paris to be a tramp and whiner, not a cop doing her job."
2,Educational for whom?,"This was given to my 5 and 6 year olds who already knew some addition groups (doubles, +0, +1, +2). The toy did not give them sufficient time to select the correct answer. Instead of letting them press in the numbers, they have to watch a list of numbers go quickly by, pressing a button when they see the correct answer. This is not sufficient because there is no ""think"" time in which to come up with the answer themselves since they have to watch a lot of wrong answers go by. My one-year-old likes it because it beeps alot."
2,Weird,"I got this for my kids to work on their +/- facts, but there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the facts. I was thinking it would cover 0+0 through 10+10 or 12+12 (and the corrisponding subtraction facts), but there are ""facts"" in there like 38+2 etc. Since it is timed on the drill (see how many questions you can answer in 60 seconds), it would be nice if the child could type in the answer rather than wasting time waiting for the right answer to appear. They *can* save some time by pushing the > button to show the next answer. When the answer does appear, they can either push ""enter"" or give the whole little thing a flick. My kids did like doing the flick, but together with pushing the > button, the whole thing is confusing. AND to top it off, while you are trying to think, they have ""The Entertainer"" playing very loudly (thank goodness you can turn the sound off). My preschooler likes to play with it only for the sounds and flicking. My school-aged children do not."
2,not a four-star flick at all!,"I was browsing listmania lists on Amazon and saw this on several peoples lists as a recommended film. I was amazed and thought this must be a mistake, these people can't have seen the same ""The Chair"" I saw...but obviously they did and so I felt compelled to say for the record, avoid this movie. The cover makes this film look like it could be a interesting movie with a novel twist, but that being said the content of this film is far from interesting and has surprisingly little to do with the chair. I understand that this movie was low budget, and I appreciate film-makers who are able to create amazing art without a lot of funds, but the chair is a case of getting what you paid for."
2,Don't waste your time...,"Started off ok, fans of paranormal and horror films would take interest in this film at the start... but once you get further into the story, it is so unrealistic I found myself yelling ""yeah right"" at the tv for the last hour. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Classic years? Perhaps. Classic songs? NO,"The fact that none of these songs got close to the top of the pop charts will tell volumes. This is nowhere near their best work.Go with The Best of the Bee Gees, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. Their best stuff"
3,Missing Episodes,"So what is the point of selling almost all of a series except for 2 episodes? Which one of those episodes can be bought in the non-HD versions, yet other episodes are missing from the non-HD season 4. If they get around to giving us a complete season perhaps I'll buy it...."
5,SUPERNATURAL,Okay so everyone you must see this the Winchester bros don't just end with Sam and Dean I won't give anymore away but you need to watch this
4,4 1/2 actually,"For a series that generally expands on ideas that have already been laid out by classic and modern movies, 4 is surprisingly original. Instead of delving out 17 episodes that are more or less self contained, and 5 or so that concentrate on the overall story arc, most of the episodes here concern the story that has been evolving since the start. It moves slower, and gets a bit too melodramatic at points, but the writing on the series as reached a peak with this season. There is an abundance of fresh ideas and many clever spins on the shows own mythology. Great series, best season."
4,?,I was very pleased with quality of dvd's but disappointed that the case was broken almost like it was cut during packaging process.
3,"all good, but came with a broken inside case","It came as soon as it was estimated, one thing tho, it came with a broken insides of the case and cd's were just thrown into place. I don't know it this is seller's or delivery fault. However, otherwise it's ok."
5,Supernatural Season 4,"I enjoy this series a lot. This season is no exception. If you like this show and haven't seen this season, It wouldn't hurt to check it out."
4,Four Seasons Cliffhanger,Nice lead up to a final cliffhanger unlike anything I have seen before. I wonder how the writers are going to write their way out of this? Good character development and interesting twists.
3,Best Show On TV. Worst Picture on Blu Ray.,I am bummed to be writing this review. Supernatural is my favorite show on TV and this was the best season so far. I am NOT critisizing the show. The Blu Ray transfer looks awful. It is grainy and inconsistent. I watched the last episode of season 4 on TV tonight and compared it to the Blu Ray and besides the HUGE CW logo on the screen the TV picture looked much clearer. I have a pretty good player. It's a Panasonic BD 30. It is fully updated and in perfect working condition. I can't believe they did such a BAD JOB on such a GREAT SHOW.
3,Too Far Afield?,"Is this fourth season moving too far afield concentrating as it does on an approaching Armageddon and war between putative Angels and trafficking with Demons? I personally preferred the first seasons where the emphasis was on Ghostbusting although the story threads are now deeper (and I would guess offend some people).Production values remain unchanged and it's still a good 'watch' if you're into this type of programme but i'd like to see a return of the humorous aspects evident in the earlier series.Either way - if you enjoyed the first three series, you'll still enjoy the fourth, but maybe not as much."
5,"Kripke, Kripke, Oh Kripke!","I can't wait until the release of the Season 4 DVD set!I worship Eric Kripke! He and the team went all out this season! I was shocked, surprised (lesser form of shock), devastated and amazed. Season 4 wasn't as lighthearted as the first 3 seasons. I broke out my box of tissue often as I watched Kripke and Company tear the brothers apart, beginning with Sex and Violence. The following 8 episodes were just as brutal as the wedge between the boys deepened and the evil seemed undefeatable.This show is well written, well acted (love Jensen & Jared) and well delivered. The emotional roller coaster ride that it took me on was almost too much to take toward the end of the season. I need an intervention, but if offered a trip to Supernatural rehab, I would have to refuse. This is the best television series ever! Nothing comes close to this. Nothing."
5,Supernatural's best season so far!!,"This season is absolutely crucial for the entire series, not only plot wise but also in terms of characters. There is no episode where you don't get surprised or shocked by all the twists and turns that happen. A true Supernatural fan should have this season and a newbie too, because here you'll find the climax to the first three seasons!!"
1,Supernatural season 4 - blu-ray,"The season four in itself is excellent. The blu-ray looks awfully crappy: all my doubts during the grainy episode one were confirmed in the first scenes of episode two when some kind of grid of regular white scratches hovered on the screen ! I am very upset, because the DVD sets of the previous seasons never showed such distracting defaults. And I know for fact TV series on blu-ray can be stunning (HBO true blood's first season). I wish someone put an end to any attempt from blu-ray editors to sell such a bad product : they are the one that are destroying the market and they are doing it right now."
1,Downgrading the product?,"I love this show very much, but I still can't understand warner bros random contents politics. The previous blu ray season had include not only spanish subtitles, but even the spanish castilian dubbed version (which I'd never watched because I love to listen the real voices of the actors) And this one doesn't include any of that, not awful dubbing, not spanish subtitles. Reason....?Warner bros people, just in case you're wondering, neither Supernatural or Smallville for that matter hasn't been edited on blu ray on Spain, and it seems that they won't be in a near future. So... why to discriminate spanish fans that really want the high def version...? It's cheaper to include spanish sbt than do the same on blu rays..?"
2,DISAPPOINTED!!,"I had been eagerly awaiting the release of this season's DVD but when I watched it I was VERY disappointed!! I will think twice before I purchased any subsequent seasons. The writing and the stories (especially the one with the ""stuffed teddy bear"" were of a lower caliber and dismal in comparison to the previous seasons.The only highlight in my opinion, was when ""Dean' is singing (lip synching) on the top of a car (I don't think this was a part of the written material) but it was hysterical and very well performed!"
1,DVDs came beat up,"The product was sold as NEW, however the case itself was broken on the inside. DVDs worked fine, but I would not classify this product as ""new"" and will not purchase from this seller again."
5,awesome value,Ive shopped around and most stores want in the 60 to 70 dollar range for this product. Amazon is awesome!
3,Blu-ray quality a disappointment,I enjoy the series very much. I was disappointed in the quality of the season four blu-ray version. I have season three in dvd and the color and picture quality is better than season four blu-ray! amazing.
5,supernatural review,I loved this episode very funny. The thing with the manic-depressive suicidal bear was way to funny. Supernatural as always is the best thing on t.v.
5,Great season!,"This was the best season yet! It ties everything together and leaves you wanting more. It has a good mixture of ""monster of the week"" type episodes and story arcs so it doesn't get serious to the point of being depressing or boring.The acting is superb and Sam and Dean and Bobby just keep getting better and better. The characters are so believable which is saying alot for a show that is purely fiction.One of the things I have always liked about Supernatural is that they have little nuggets and inside jokes for those of us who have been watching it from the begining.I can not wait to watch it this season!"
4,Another excellent season of Supernatural,"I haven't yet sat down and watched the series from end-to-end. I caught much of it when originally broadcast, and the writing continues to be a real pleasure. I look forward to doing a Supernatural end-to-end marathon (all seasons) sometime early this summer."
2,Horrible Blu-ray transfer of a great show!!!,"I ordered Supernatural Season 4 blu-ray from Amazon.com and when it arrived I started what I thought would be a marathon watching the episodes.Right away with the very first episode the quality of the video was terrible. The picture was full of grain (where there should not be grain) and overall the video just stunk. I did manage to sit through all the episodes over 4 nights because this show is one of the best on network tv and I've been a fan since day 1.I am definitely not happy with the transfers of this season of Supernatural. Perhaps putting all 22 episodes on 4 discs didn't help the quality either. And, of course, none of the hi-def sites have had reviews of this set posted as of today or I would not have ordered it.Such a shame too because I love this show and was hoping for at least the same quality that was broadcast over satellite."
5,A must have for fans.,"One of the best shows ever made. If you are a Buffy or even a Girefly fan this series has everything. This season is the season that usually slumps for most show but they made a major, thought consistant, change in the mythology that brought in a fresh storyline and dynamic relationship betwenn the brothers.My one disappointment in the DVD set is the lack of great features. I haven't finished every special feature but I am on the last disk and nothing has really stood out as need to see."
5,LOVE IT,I love supernatural but the set was displayed in a beautiful collectors edition box. Special features where also enjoyed. I love IT!!!
1,Not Impressed,I payed about $20 for this and when i open the package I had taken it out of the box and the case is falling apart both of the divider things that hold the disks is not attached the latches on it is broken and i don't know about other people but i want my DVDS to stay all together and be able to close the case. So I am not happy with what i saw for $20.
3,Broken?,I opened this product and the discs seem to be in great condition but the case is falling apart! The places the discs are held are completely broken from the actual case! It was pretty irritating because I spent about $25 on it. Other than that good condition. I love Supernatural and am just happy to have them.
5,Favorite Show!,I'm really glad that I could find this season for this price it was perfect since I was only missing this one and another.
3,"Great show, awkward packaging","I had no problems with the shipping or DVDs, everything was delivered on time with no flaws. The season came in 6 separate DVD boxes which is a pain and why I only rated this 3 stars. It would be easier, more space conscious, and more convenient if it had the standard packaging for most DVD seasons."
5,Supernatural,"Es la mejor serie, muy buena temporada. A decir verdad, sigo esta serie por tv desde el 2005 y compro las series para verla nuevamente y coleccionarla 100% recomendada"
1,Supernatural Amazon Purchase Experiencde,One of the discs is scratched so that we are missing 5 episodes of the season. The box that the discs came in was cracked.
4,Supernatural Season 4,"I thought the first season was a little moronic and too teenage like. However, I stuck with the show and kept watching and it is greatly improved. It is a little scary, but a good bottom story about the brothers and their Dad is worth watching."
3,"Great product, bad packaging","Although the product was great (how could it not be) the packaging was in bad shape. I don't expect to pay good money for something that's going to come out of the shipping container in three pieces. Not Amazon's fault, but one of their suppliers."
5,Nice items,"Though sth happened when I booked them first time, but with the help of Amazon, they reached me finally.Made me happy even as a big gift at the begining of 2010.Thanks for all!"
4,Supernatural,"Excellent show that is well acted and well written. I hate to see it end, but I can understand why since the story line is heading that way. I hope the two actors, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki can found in other shows."
5,I enjoyed the series and the relationship of the two brothers tremendously,"I enjoyed the series tremendously, although I was skeptical watching the first season, however after the first couple of episodes I actually got pretty hooked. It has all it takes ....I would say..there is drama, action, comedy...romance you name it....I even Looking for the fifth season to come out. Will definitely buy it."
5,Fantastic,This is my most favourite show and this series didnt let me down. The boys just keep getting better. I am now hanging out for the next series. I hope I dont have to wait to long.
5,Supernatural is the best series I have seen,"This has been one of the best seasons of the series. I totally recommend it. Moreover, thanks to Amazon because the packing and delivery was great. I love buying the products directly from them, they haven't dissapoint me yet."
5,SUPER,"Product came in quick, and I live on GUAM. Very satisfied with the way it was shipped and packed. It was really specific on the details of the product, which I think helped me purchase this item and other products."
5,The Vonnegut episode...ha!,"Don't miss this one, or you won't meet Chuck the Prophet. This is a mind-bender, even in the ultra-weird world of Sam and Dean. And, this is the episode in which they discover fandom and slash...too funny!"
5,Herman and his Hermits,If you liked these guys way back when you will love this collection. It included every song that they had as hits in their original format. No remakes. There's a kind of hush all over the world tonight...Love this collection and highly recommend it! They do not make music like this anymore!
1,Avoid this CD!,"It says ""Remastered."" It is not. These recordings are so bad they sound like old vinyl recordings after being playing a thousand times. By the time I got to ""Hold On,"" I almost couldn't make out what song it was. This is a great disappointment - and a major rip-off. Oh, and by the way, the carriage holding the CDs fell apart - now held together by rubberband."
3,Some hot... some not,"There are some real gems on this CD but there are far too many duds in between. If you are interested in the whole range, it's worth hearing all the way through... once."
2,If you like them,"Good music if you're a fan otherwise ""No Milk today"" is the only one you would like!"
5,The Definitive CD,"The CD ""The Vert Best of Hermans Hermits"" finally offers a complete collection of all of their hits on a doubleCD. There are so many classic album cuts that, that alone makes this CD one that you have to have in yourcollection. You get all the hits in good sound quality. My only critique is that you still are unable to get theirmusic in stereo. Despite this one flaw, after listening to a few songs you become embellished in their music.You forget that it is in mono because the songs are so good. You get 51 songs plus 5 bonus songs. This isthe only CD you will ever need by the Hermits. Buy it. You will be glad that you did. There numerous standoutsongs that normally don't appear on their Greatest Hits packages, Dream on Dream On, Take Love Give Love,For Love, Nobody Wants To Know, It's Allright Now, and I Gotta Dream On. Songs 13 & 14 on Disc 2 are presented in stereo."
4,"deer, howey, zussman review",Great reference book for any geologist or rock hound. Contains amazing amounts of information on rock forming minerals.
3,Herr Strek,if you are going to psu and taking mineralogy this book is recommended. i bought it and have barely used it at all. the internet gives the same info for free. stick with the minerals in this sections.
1,This book taught me never judge a book by its cover,"The cover, looked good. This is really a joke and I am offended that some one makes a living writing this ...I am a father of three and was looking for a differing view, a different point of focus, not useless dribble. Worse than the mind numbing one liners, is the lousy advice. 30% of the contents, which by my experience and training, is totally wrong.Well, I guess after 20 years of formal education and 10 in the field, I can still get a cheap education ...(...). I especially liked Leny's from Ireland, I just wish I had read it first. It's a good thing the book only tells us to ""teach your kid how to throw a punch"", not how to, because this kind of mindless tree killing could increase world-wide aggression. A humble opinion."
3,cute but not much more,"I don't want to trash this book. It's cute and kind. I think it would make a good gift for a certain kind of father-to-be. But I agree with the reviewer from Philadelphia. We also need stronger, deeper books that speak of the true challenge and meaning of fatherhood. Would you rather read a chapter telling you to teach your son how to eat an Oreo or a chapter about helping your son shape his own spiritual journey? If you believe the latter is more important, you should get Nerburn's Letters to My Son. I read this book years ago and I still give it to fathers who are searching for ways to bring their sons to a meaningful manhood -- and to women whose sons have no fathers in their lives. So, give Father to Son to parents as a kind gift of the ""oh, isn't this cute"" sort. Give Letters to My Son to parents who are deeply concerned about raising good sons. Both kinds of books have their place. Just don't confuse the cute with the profound."
4,"Light, but Genuine","This is not a deep treatise on the challenges of raising a son, nor a challenging sociological essay. It is, however, a charming collection of very thoughtful and apt observations of some of the duties and privileges of being the father of a young boy; full of the kinds of points that seem obvious once you read them but which are still helpful to be reminded of. I have reread this book several times as my son has grown, and have taken away new points at each stage of his life. This would be a great gift for a new father."
3,"adequate as a ""teaser"" . . .","This book was entertaining and I guess useful . . . but it doesn't go very deep. Other recent reads that take it to a deeper level include FATHERTIME by Scribner and Frey, and LETTERS TO MY SON by Nerbern. It's important for fathers to be reading stuff like this, but also to take it to the next level ..."
3,Not very helpful,Was disappointed in book. Didn't have that much information or thought. Just some basic ideas with no additional information. Just a gift book and nothing more.
4,"A great gift for dad, but a must-read for moms first!","I gave this book to my husband the day our son was born. I think he enjoyed the inscription inside the front cover that I wrote the most, but he did enjoy the book also. It is humorous as well as touching. It also gives great advice for the harder situations to deal with. I think this is a must read for a mother who is having her first son. I got a lot out of this book that is probably second nature to my husband."
1,"insipid, trite, and hackneyed","From the description, we thought this was a book of advice and insights. Instead, it is a little book of mundane aphorisms, one sentence nuggets of advice of uneven quality. The book makes a lot of outdated assumptions about gender roles and the nature of fathers and sons and their relationship. We're disappointed, since there aren't many books on the subject. We're sorry we purchased it, even at the sale price of $1.50, and now we will just give it away. Don't waste your money, or your time."
4,Good book,"After seeing this book at one of the stores at Wisconsin Dells, I found an interest in it as what life lessons it has for me to teach my future son/s.Overall it's a good book, glad I purchased it."
2,Not what I expected...,"This is just a book of quotations. It has good quotations, but there is not a lot of them, and its a tiny book. I do not think it was worth it."
5,game,"For the game collector. I bought this for my husbands extensive game collection, and he loves it. For the classic game collector."
4,"A necessary book: among the best critics, beautiful poems.","Don't be buffaloed by Times reviewer: Denby's poems are American treasures, not ""quaint"" in any way; they are densely wrought, large scale beyond their compact sonnet formats, piquant. & yes, as critic, Denby is among the topmost immortals -- meaning he ranks with Diderot, Shaw, Baudelaire. Poems & dance writings both put forth companionable, no-nonsense, strict, generous urbane attitude: ""Dance criticism has two different aspects: one is being made drunk for a second by seeing something happen; the other is expressing lucidly what you saw when you were drunk."" And: ""Actual events are obscure/ Though the observers appear clear."""
3,Only for the dedicated Farscape fan.,"Outstanding 1st track, and the occasional good track elsewhere, but to be brutal, this is a CD only for avid watchers of the series, because each track is from a certain episode, they trigger memories. Unfortunately if you have not watched most of the episodes accross the series then the music loses its full inpact."
3,"Good music, but not comparable to other scifi soundtracks","I'm an avid Farscape follower, and so when I found a copy of it at the local bookstore, I purchased it. It's good, diverse music, the theme song is excellant, and it makes for good background music. If you're someone who has never seen Farscape and just wants the music, I highly suggest purchasing instead either the LEXX soundtrack or the Tales From a Parallel Universe soundtrack, both of which are for the same show and have marvelous, powerful and in some cases, elegant music. (Look up the ""Tales From A..."" soundtrack and preview the song Fantasy Dance!)"
5,Farscape,I've only herd the the theme song of farscape but if its any indication of whats on the cd it must be great
3,Interesting but . . .,"The book was interesting but contained vey little new information so I was disappointed in it. However, if you have no background if this area you might find it useful, I didn't."
4,"Definitely better than ""Lake of Fire""","Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars on this one. Not a bad short read despite the fact that two company crossovers like this tend to be more of a novelty than good story telling.If you want to see Batman and the Punisher duke it out then I'd highly recommend this overBatman Punisher: Lake of Firewhich features ""Azrael"" instead of the real Bruce Wayne Batman.Oh yeah, and Klaus Janson's highly stylized art work is always a pleasure."
3,light bulb,"I was happy to find this item and it arrived packaged well and it is exactly what I ordered, but it didn't work. Since I bought two of them, I tried them both and neither of them worked. What are the chances? I think it is the switch on my oven that's the problem, not the bulbs."
4,Bi-Pin G4 base 5 wolt Bulbs Review,The Bi-Pin G4 base 5 Volt Bulbs were so hard to find the exact onesbut AMAZON came through! THANKS!
4,Paul Clayton is back!,"It's great to hear the late, but still so vivid, Paul Clayton again. I think he was the best interpreter of sea shanties ever, and now I hear he also could sing and write on the subject ""matrimony""! A little bit like Pete Seeger, but with a bit lower voice.I'm reading the new biography as well!"
1,Just an advertisement,"I have been trying to convince my mother that low-carb dieting isn't the way she should try to lose weight. When I saw the title of this audiobook, I was excited thinking that I found something that would explain the pitfalls and fallacies of shunning carbs. I decided to listen to it first so that I would have the facts at my disposal. I'm sure glad I did. The entire book is merely an advertisement for Dr. Sears Zone diet and fish oil pills....which, surprise!, he sells.Plus, he calls the fish oil pills that he doesn't sell, and therefore are not supposedly ultra-pure, sewer of the seas. However, Consumer Reports did a study on many of the pills on the market and found no contamination in them at all.There is nothing in this book worth spending the time or money for."
5,If anything can get as good as the Beatles it's this book!,"The best book ever written about the fab four. No sex, no drugs (well almost),only pure rock. Mark Hertsgaard is perhaps the first writer who has done justice to the lads' remarkable talent. From the initial Hamburg days to the London days of Please Please Me to the acid trip of Pepper to the grim reality of Let It Be, Hertsgaard gives a true analysis of the most imoportant aspect of the Beatles -- the music. If you have atleast one Beatle album (otherwise you would not be listening to music anyways, would you?) this is the book you must have for a better understanding of the works of the greatest musicians on this planet. What are you waiting for?"
3,"Not reliable, and not objective","Hertsgaard's book is interesting in parts, but contains little that is truly informative about the music itself, which after all is the chief claim of his project. There simply is no book that considers the Beatles' music from a theoretical, musicological point of view, putting their melodic and harmonic writing into historical perspective - I've really tried to find one. If one is looking for insight into the studio process - the recording of the songs, as opposed to the compositions themselves - then there is no competition for ""The Beatles Recording Sessions,"" which is not perfect, but contains vast amounts of previously unknown info about each and every session."
2,"Repetitive, shallow valentine with a few insights","Why would Hertsgaard title this book ""A Day in the Life"" and then dismiss the song by that name in a vague paragraph? That's one of the many inconsistencies in a book that is afraid to say anything critical about the Beatles, to the point of sacrificing reader interest. While he does effectively detail the chronology of the Beatles' success, he does not offer any new or original insights into the group itself. As he recounts the studio chatter from a recording session, Hertsgaard sounds like a wallflower guest at a party, eavesdropping on the popular guests and then winkingly recounting the talk as if he were ""one of the boys"". Transparent and disappointing, ""A Day in the Life"" reads like the fan club newsletter, edited and approved by Paul himself."
1,5 Reasons why I didn't like the book:,1- Hertsgaard has nothing new to say2- He repeats himself3- the majority of what is in here is the author's opinion4- Very negative view on John Lennon for some reason5- He isn't an inside source
3,A Dull Tribute,"This is a book for people who know little about the Beatles. It was much praised by critics for focusing on the music, but really most of what is said is descriptive - you can find out this stuff for yourself by simply listening to the albums, which I recommend doing rather than reading about it -or perhaps with the books ""A Hard Day's Write"" by Steve Turner and ""The Beatles Recording Sessions"" by Mark Lewisohn on hand, if one really wants to shed light on the music."
5,AWESOME CD,"This is a great cd!!! one of the best tribute albums anywhere, the second i heard ""Diabolic"" covering ""Rapture"" i HAD to buy this album!!! It is impeccable, the sound is great, the bands are great, and everything is perfect abut it. I wish i could've given it 10 stars!"
2,Not up the level of Volumes 1 through 4,"I really enjoyed the first 4 volumes of the Savage Destiny series, but Ms. Bittner seems to have run out of steam in #5. Almost the entire first half of the book is summarizing and retelling what happened in #1 thru #4, multiple times. Enough already! This is an epic saga, so perhaps the author could have included a separate synopsis to refresh her readers' memories. I'm also disappointed that she does little to further develop the characters of Dan, Bonnie, Anna Gale, and the Monroe children. She has other interesting characters and other good story lines, and while we all love Abbie and Zeke, it would be good to really develop the other characters and subplots, instead of rehashing over and over again what happened to Abbie and Zeke in former volumes. Instead of 5 pages of Abbie crying and explaining all over again how much she loves Zeke, multiple times, I would prefer that the story move forward. Hopefully, the series will pick up steam in #5."
1,Not Compatible with RFA-67,"The negative review is on the listing as opposed to the product itself, which is tied to the wrong product.I am apparently not the first one to be fooled. You type RFA-67 and this is the third item that comes up. It is difficult to tell the difference in the picture of this Amazon listing. These are just basic off-the shelf button batteries (appear just like CR2032 which are generally $1 or less each), and are NOT compatible with RFA-67. I have asked Amazon to modify this listing so it does not mislead others."
5,batteries work as expected to :-),They're batteries. What can I say? They are the right size and work as expected. It was convenient to get them online though.......
2,Frustrating product,"After 3 tries, I finally have a collar that works. I bought one last year that failed to work but I had lost the receipt so I could not easily get it replaced. I ordered another one in desperation. Again it did not work, but I had kept the receipt. Customer service was prompt and efficient at replacing it but I had the impression that they have to do this often. This one does work, but I am still not particularly happy with how it works. It seems the collar has to be incredibly tight around the dogs neck for him to feel the shock. The transmitter is clumbsy and awkward to hold let alone fit in a pocket."
3,This is the 3V NOT the 6V battery,"PetSafe makes the 3V & 6V battery for the collars but you can NOT tell the difference in packaging by the pic, unfortunately. Nor do the batteries themselves state the voltage. Petsafe should do a better job at marking their product and package to not cause such confusion. I think this 3V is for the smaller dog collars. If you have a med-large dog you prob have the collar that needs the 6V RFA-67."
5,Works as intended,These work as intended and with daily use they last around a month. Very convenient to get them on here and not have to search the stores for them. I order a couple packs at a time so I have them in the drawer when the old ones lose power.
5,a toy for all ages,"I bought this for my kids for Christmas a year or so ago, and have never regretted it! They enjoy all of the different musical combinations and the this toy has wonderful sound quality. The blocks have been kicked, hidden and placed in the toy with toddler force, but the toy has never failed to function. It still plays beautifully. My husband and I have donated some of our kids' toys, thrown some pieces away, had garage sales, but this toy has survived them all. We always hold it back."
2,Caution - won't work long,"I got this for my youngest daughter as she absolutely loves music. The company is out of business which is why this item is drastically reduced. Within 2 days, it quit working. Seems as though there is a short under one of the blocks. Tried to have my husband fix it. It worked for about 1/2 an hour afterwards. At this point it's useless as a music toy. My daughter does enjoy the colorful blocks. Great idea, poor product quality control. Buyer beware. Hope yours doesn't break like mine. There's no recourse."
2,Great Concept but terrible quality,"I love the idea of this toy. My son loved it until it stopped working after 2 months. Nobody at Neurosmith would return my calls and since it was a gift, Target won't take it back."
5,Great for Autistic Children,This is one heck of a bargain for this developmental toy. I bought one 5 years ago for my autistic son. It never gets old. He still enjoys it because they keep supplying new cartridges. The bottom line.... Any kind of kid or developing young adult will love this. The quality of the sound is great and the item is durable.
2,IM GETTIN IT,"Hi. I want u ppl 2 no that I only gave one star in those places cause I don't have the doll yet. Im gettin' it off Ebay soon. (hopefully)it doesnt have any other bids(yay). What i dont get is that @ the top of this page it says she can sit up, but the manufacturer's review says she can't. I mean, i don't really care, but they should get their facts strait.I am not african-american, but I want this doll anyway. I also hope 2 get lots of the little mommmy accessories& REALLY want the ocean wonders 4-in-1 play yard. (4 dolls)Love,Darcy (11,Kansas)"
2,"Not the power it says and takes C's, not AA's!",This does not have even half the power I'd expected. It does have enough if you don't like it powerful but a five dollar one I'd gotten had way more power than this. Wish I had known because it is non-returnable. It also gets unclear on the batteries so I'm letting you know that it does take C's. The color is also off. It is more like a very light pink and a bland one atthat. Doesn't matter to me but thought I'd put it out there incase it would to you.
2,........,"It does glow and the batters were a plus,but the power f it was weak.IT do have to admit it is anice size."
3,Not What I expected,I got this the day it went in stores. I have to say it isn't what I expected. The sing-along didn't show back-up vocals. I thought it would be a live concert and it isn't. It was alright. (Comments from my 9 year old daughter)
2,Only One Good Movie,"I expected this set to be a little better than it was. It wasn't.In my opinion, the only good movie was 16 Blocks (2006).The other movie that came behind it was the Last Boy Scout.The other two movies were bad in my opinion. Last Man Standing was BORING, and The Whole Nine Yards was full of adultery and the movie had an artificial Hollywood feel to it. I am thinking about throwing this dvd set away.Be warned this movie set is very weak."
5,Two thumbs up,"I am in agreement with the first reviewer. I have purchased and enjoyed this CD and their previous offering, Recquiem. When I listened to Requiem, I thought the musical accompaniment was less than satisfactory for such high quality singing and I was also disappointed that there were no songs which showcased the other fine voices so strongly tauted on the cover. Both of these concerns have been amply remedied in this offering. This CD is already one of my favorites. The only complaints I have are that the cover booklet is almost useless, giving very little information about this talented group of boy singers or the music they bring to such vibrant life, and that there are so few CD's from this group available. I eagarly await thier next offering."
5,Words escape me...,"Wow. This recording simply knocked me off my feet the first time I heard it. It is a superb example of treble singing. The pieces are very well chosen and arranged. My top favorite is the ""O for the wings of a dove"" which is surely a classic masterpiece and brings a tear to my eye every time I listen to it. The piece is perfect for showing off the vocal talent of Edward Burrowes and brings out every subtle nuance of his beautiful voice. It simply must be heard, and is quite beyond words. I would even go so far as to say it is a better performance than the highly acclaimed 1923 performance by Ernest Lough and the Temple Church choir."
3,Cute,"I purchased this rocker for my one year old who loves Elmo. The rocker is cute, but not as sturdy as other Little Tikes' products. It is hollow plastic and it can tip if your toddler isn't good at climbing on. Also, the Elmo voice is cute, but it doesn't ""speak"" unless it is vigerously rocked. I end up tapping on the front end of it to make it talk while my daughter plays on it. That said, it was a worthwile purchase."
2,not very sturdy,The product was not very easy to put together and the holes were not cut.. Not a very sturdy toy.
3,Elmo Rocker is too small,The rocker was easy to put together but it is not very big. The age range goes up to three years but our 18 month old is almost too big for it and she is not a big baby.
3,Meyers Basil Bar Soap (12x8 OZ),"FYI, this is for 1 bar of Meyer's Basil Bar Soap, not 12. When I bought it the description was ""Meyers Basil Bar Soap (12x8 OZ)"" which led me to believe there were 12, 8oz bars. (""12x8 oz"" sounds like twelve eight ounce bars, right?) The product description also listed the weight as 8lbs, which makes sense if there were 12 bars (12 * 8oz = 6lbs. I know, 6 isn't 8, but maybe the box was the other 2lbs?). But don't be fooled. This is for a single bar. Mine was $10, for one bar. You should check around, I guarantee you'll find it cheaper elsewhere."
1,"Great soap, but ONE bar, not 12","Great soap. Just love it.However, the listing says 12*8. THIS IS THE COST FOR ONE BAR. Not 12. You can get this cheaper just about anywhere - Safeway, CVS, Whole Foods (and when you can get it cheaper at Whole Foods, you know you are getting ripped off).And if you try to return it, you pay 3/4 of the price for return shipping. Just high enough that it's hard to justify.So please, don't encourage this kind of troll on Amazon. Meyers is a great product, but you can get it for less just about anywhere than this seller."
4,"clean, like soap should","A nice, big, clean-smelling, easy to lather up, bar of soap. What more can be said about it?"
4,A must have for a better life style,I know counting carbs is out. But I am diabetic type II.Following Stellas recipes is easy. My sugar is normal. I am not hungry and best of all the food is great.You may have to cut his portions down unless you are having the neighbors over. My weight loss has been about 1 lb per week. Fast enough for me.It took 20 years to put on 50 lbs.I can wait 7 months to lose it.It is not a diet but a life style change. Also my blood work came back normal.My body doesnt have many carbs to work with so It must use fats for energy.
2,Not so great,I bought this book for my husband who is the main cook in our family. We have been trying to increase our low carb meals and I read good reviews about his book. I was disappointed in how few recipes there actually were. We had used the South Beach cookbook before and I found it more complete and versatile. It's not a bad cookbook but best for a novice low carb chef.
5,JR,"I have been low eating carb for several years. I have purchased several LC cookbooks. This is by far the best one. George lays out his Living Low Carb Plan in simple and easy to understand terms. I especially enjoyed him sharing his family's story of their low carb journey. His receipes are simple, easy to make amd add a nice variety to the low carb way of eating. Good job!!! The book exceeds my expectations."
3,"Great book,bad binding","This by far is a great book. The recipes are delicious and a great diet. But the binding fell apart in days. I brought it to Staples to get rebound with a spiral binder like a recipe book should be,so you can lay it flat. That cost me another 4 bucks. Other than the bad binding the book is very good,thaats why I gave it 3 stars."
5,Easy to Read,The format of the book makes it very easy to read and the author keeps ingredients simple. Most recipes are from fresh foods which are of course the best for us. Another good point...fancy high dollar equipment is not needed to follow his recipes. Following low carb the Stella Style is going to be fun. Look hopefully for another cookbook in the future.
3,Not quite what I was looking for.,"When I purchased the book for my Kindle I was on the Atkins Diet and looking for a way to beat the boredom of it. One of the objectives was to come up with easy ideas that did not make me think about food all the time. I suppose the book lives up to its promise, but I did not want to substitute things like soy flour and other tricks for desserts and other temptations such as pancakes. I would rather avoid those things altogether on a weight loss regimen. I do not have much in the way of will power, so simply not having those things around -- low carb or not -- is much easier for me. What I wanted was a way to make a six ounce, boneless, skinless chicken breast seem like a sumptuous meal. I suppose that is just wishful thinking."
4,An instant treasure,Simple recipes with great flavor to help keep us on the low carb track. A valued addition to my kitchen recipes.
2,Formatting,"The recipes look great in this book, but the Kindle version is awful. The formatting is so bad that I have had to buy the paper version in order to be able to use this book.It does not show up this way when you look at the preview. I think publishers need to be sure that the formatting works before offering the ebook."
5,We're Believers of the Stella Way,"I know I feel better when I eat a low carb diet but getting my husband to join me has often been difficult. I tried Atkins but I don't want to go out and buy all his prepackaged foods. Plus, they were't all that tasty. For the last two weeks, I have tried a variety of the recipes with great success. Our favorite is the Tequila Chicken, thought the Mock Mashed Potatos are delicious too. Baking with soy powder is fine, I can't tell a difference really. George has a sweeter tooth than us so we find we might reduce some of the sweetener in the recipes too. George uses more salt than we do so I just cut it out when I can. I am excited aobut cooking agina, about eating well, I feel better than I have in months and best of all, mu husband says everything I've made is fabulous and we share more dinners together. I recommend to anyone."
5,Good book good food,i love food and this cookbook is great! The food is easy quick and tastes great - the frozen chocolate blueberries are absolutely dreamy!
5,happy shopper,Great book with great recipes. Not only are the recipes easy but are delicious. I recommend highly.
5,Simply Fantastic,"Stella's cookbook is, BY FAR, the best in the low carb category. The recipes are extremely easy, delicious, and made with normal, ordinary ingredients. The most outrageous ingredient is probably soy flour, which is hardly odd or difficult to locate in any grocery store.The tequila chicken is my favorite so far, but everything has been phenomenal. A cook of any level will enjoy making these recipes and everyone around the table will enjoy eating them!"
2,Not a good book for low fat recipes,"While some of the recipes look good, with the amount of cheese and other high fat items, it makes it impossible for those of us with high cholesterol. Disappointing."
1,a bad buy,"I am not a seasoned cook. I would not recommend to a friend. The recipes have a lot of ingrediants. Unless you are a huge cook dont buy this book. You will find yourself wondering around the grocery store trying to locate things you have never even heard of before ( thats what i was doing ) There are no pictures either, that was a big let down. I was looking for simple recipes - I felt overwhelmed when I read this - even more overwhelmed trying to find something I thought i could actually cook. I found I spent alot more at the store because each recipe had way to much stuff to buy."
1,Disappointing,"I would like to start out by saying that I have the highest regard for George Stella and his family. I first saw George on the Food Network. I have two of his cookbooks. What you should know if you are considering buying his cookbooks is that he was a professional chef for more than 20 years. Therefore, he creates dishes like ""Baked Ham with Maple Burbon Glaze"", ""Grilled Country-Style Pork Ribs with Bourbon Barbecue Sauce"", ""Roasted Rosemary Pork Loin"" ""Stuffed Meat Loaf Rollatini"" ""Stuffed Eggplant"" ""Stuffed Pumpkin"", etc, etc, etc. Well, I'm sorry, George, I just don't have time to fuss over dinner like that. He also has some recipes for low-carb baking, created, I believe by his wife, Rachel. Rachel uses soy flour in her recipes. I just can't acquire the taste for soy. To me, it's nasty! Sorry, George."
4,Great ideas,This has some great low carb recipes. Everything I have made I have liked. I do wish they gave some alternative ideas on sweetners (all the recipes use Splenda). I have had good luck substituting stevia. The story of George's transformation is inspiration!
5,Livin' Low Carb,Great book and recipes! My husband and I have already made several of these recipes and so far all have been great and satisfying. We especially like the cheesecakes!
5,George Stella's Livin Low carb,"I have never reviewed a book before...Wouldn't take the time. Also, I have a lot of low carb cook books. This book is so easy and every recipe is better than the one before. The food is delicious and I recomend it anyone who wants to keep thier diet healthy and low carb. I love it."
4,Good cookbook,"I have tried a couple of the recipes and I love the pizza recipe, the brownies, not so great. It looks like a good variety of recipes and I'm looking forward to trying them. I'm pleased with the book"
2,"Low Carb - Maybe, Yummy Recipes - Nope","I've been eating low carb for a while now and bought this book specifically because it had Appetizer, Snack and Dessert sections. It's easy to find low-carb entree recipes in any ""Meat"" section of any cookbook.So far I've made about 5 recipes and all of them have turned out pretty gross. I don't expect low-carb desserts to taste like the real thing but I also don't expect them to taste like cardboard. The snacks and appetizers I've made have lacked flavor as well.These recipes might be low carb but they are NOT low fat. There is a lot of butter, cheese, cream, sour cream and other dairy products in these recipes that don't make for an overall healthy diet.I will keep trying recipes from the book but so far I'm pretty bummed with the results."
4,Close but ... it just misses,"Another winner for Playboy. The films in this series--although formulamatic are still quite worthy of a look. This film could have been classic fare. The two lead women are achingly gorgeous. And while tension builds between them, the scene -- when it does come to pass, is largely anticlimatic. In short, this film could have been so much more. Instead, it's just average having not capitalized on it's amazing pairing of two outrageously beautiful women."
3,How about tepid club,"Judging from the opening sequence, this film showed great promise (among other things). However, the plot got in the way of the action and as a result the movie kind of stagnated. Sure the girls are smokin', but I want to see action. I don't mind dialogue if it leads to something. I can't stand dialogue when it doesn't advance the story or build the sexual tension. I can't really recommend this title. If you like the Eros Line, and I generally do, check out Temptations or Life of a Gigolo."
2,Good book if you garden in USDA Zone 8,"This book is entertaining and could be helpful if you live in an area with very moderate temperatures. Sadly many of us do not have the luxory of being able to grow most anything. This book is not of any help if you live anywhere that gets cold at all (zone 3 to 5).There are no photos, only illustrations. USDA Zones are not listed for most of the plants included in this book. This book was a pretty big disappointment to me. ( I garden in zone 5)."
2,"I love Ketsel, but the book is just ok","There were several things that Ms Levine didn't consider, she should have, I think, said she was really focused on gardens for our region, (I live in Seattle) but didn't seem to take into account some v. troublesome plants that have included on the noxious or obnoxious (a real list!) weed list with the state. Budalia (butterfly bush) for instance. The other concern I had was the inputs needed for some of the suggested plants. I would strongly suggest Mary Robson's two books on gardening for Oregon and Washington, bothMonth-By-Month Gardening in Washington & Oregon: What To Do Each Month To Have A Beautiful Garden All Year (Month-By-Month Gardening in Washington & Oregon)Washington & Oregon Gardener's GuideIn her books she considers the inputs that will be required by the gardener, easy of growing, water use, design considerations, they are both good guides for beginning and advanced gardeners."
2,"Beautiful illustrations, overly talky text","I once took a friend to a beautiful wild garden that had been planted (over many years) incredibly well. Since she is a fan of plants and gardens I had hoped that we could walk the grounds - quietly and appreciatively. Instead my friend chattered incessantly for the entire hour and a half we were there. Each plant provoked a monologue: anecdotes, jokes, asides, and factual material in an ultimately maddening cacophonous symphony. This book had the same effect on me. You are awed by the quiet beauty of Rene Eisenbart's paintings, you know that the plants described are great, but the text is so talky as to be distracting - and even annoying. If you enjoy a lot of off-topic opinions and chat about all sorts of things, then this is the book for you. If you want to study and enjoy beautiful plants in a quieter frame of mind, look elsewhere."
2,"Beautiful, disappointing","This is a beautiful book, with breathtaking original watercolors of each of the featured plants, with tons of information about the habit and culture of each. The author asks us not to hate her for living on the Oregon coast, where apparently you can grow ANYTHING. OK, I'm envious, but I don't hate her. But I can't forgive the fact that she neglects to provide USDA Hardiness Zone information for any of the plants, and only occasionally mentions that a plant doesn't like temperatures below 10F. That makes this book a big tease for the 250 million of us that don't live in the Pacific Northwest. It should come with a big warning: USEFUL ONLY IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. I abandoned this beautiful book in a cafe because I had to get it out of my house."
1,THIS ONE PISSED ME OFF. A WASTE OF MONEY,"ALOT OF THESE SONGS WERE RECYCLED FROM THEODORE UNIT AND OTHER ALBUMS. GHOST SHOULD'VE OFFERED IT AS A FREE DOWNLOAD.THE LAST SONG AT THE END, HEARD IT ALL BEFORE MADE ME LAUGH, BECAUSE I COULDN'T BELIEVE GHOST WAS RAPPING OVER THAT SUNSHINE ANDERSON SONG.WHICH WAS IRONIC TOO, BECAUSE JUST ABOUT EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM I'VE HEARD BEFORE.(I FELT CHEATED OUT OF MY MONEY)"
4,A exciting and pleasant blend that evoke one's imagination,""" For You Too, The Sun Will Shine"" is enjouable reading for both young and old. Ecellent description areas throughout invite the reader ona jouney with its characters, a journey which envokes all of one's senses and most of one's emotions. The author had used a subtle play on the words sun and son. She has skillfully blended two culturs without losing the needful tradition of keeping the family together thoughout the ages. The scenic illustrations are in keeping with the time setting of the story.B. J. Nicholas"
4,"For You,Too, the Sun Will Shine","This is a heart felt, exciting little book. It has all the makings for a movie. The dynamics are there as is the mystery , intrigue, and what we all want , a happy ending. Set back in the mid 1950's you really get a feel for the people , the land and the story . I was not ready for the ""secret"" that was held away from the character "" Laura Tia."" It was written well enough that it kept you second guessing what the secret was. The descriptive way the author went about showing you the clues was really intertwined with the dreams that "" Laura Tia"" had. She drew you in with that age old question of "" Who Am I"" and the clues drew you nearer with each turn of the page. With pictures provided that were real, it made you feel like you were on her journey too. This is a great book for all age 12 and over."
3,Review,"The book is about the loss and recovery of wildlife. It talks about how many species have vanished because of human settlement and all the negative effects we have brought. It has an indepth analysis of several ares of the country such as Yellowstone National Park, oceans, rivers, lakes, beaches, and grasslands. The good thing about this book is that it informs and provides ways in which we are able to help recover wildlife. This book is very detailed. The author uses several examples for each area he explains. It is a very informative book, but it is not a book for the average reader."
2,Not The Condor's Shadow,"I want to start my review by saying, don't judge a book by its cover or its title for that matter. Although the Condor's Shadowspeaks very little about the Condor, it does symbolize the species of the United States that have disappeared or have become endagered. But to put it blunty, I was quite TICKED, because I was lead to believe that the book was about the Condor and his shadow! The book's overall entertainment level was low, but it was a real eye opener, no doubt. It explained the impact of humans on the environment and how fragile wildlife is to the world. All and all this book put fourth a whole lot of knowledge about the environment."
4,AP Environmental Class,"I read this book for my AP Environmental class in high school. I thought this was an easy book to read. It talks about the loss and recovery of wildlife in america. It is divided up into different sections for example the east, mid-west, west, and the coastal regions. Condor's shadow can easily be used in research projects and papers. In the back of the book is a handy notes, lit cited, and index sections making it easier for further research. The author does not seem to write with any bias and keeps his point of view until the end of the book. I would recomend this book for both nature lovers and students."
4,The Condor's Shadow,"This is a good book for anyone interested in the aspects of environmental science related more to the preservation of animals. It presented facts with an informative and optimistic tone, focusing on what can be done to help endangered species as opposed to what wasn't done. It is very easy to read, the style making it accessible those who aren't scholars."
3,"Basically, it's a kid's book. Use a dive slate!","serious divers will likely think this complex system is pretty silly. A slate works really well. But for kids, or for a few basic communiques, the book has some good signals. It would take a good knowledge of the marine creatures before the signals would make sense. It does go far beyond the simple hand signals from your PADI classes. It would be a neat gift to give a Junior Open Water graduate."
2,Title of Book Vague,"It's a very cute, compact, spiral bound book with striking photographs. However, I was disappointed with my purchase.I had anticipated that the book would focus on hand signals to be used as an underwater language for divers.However, the book focuses primarily on hand signals for the identification of fish.There are 70+ pages in the book and only two pages are designated for (extremely basic) hand signals for scuba divers.If you want to communicate the id of a fish to your dive buddy, this is the book for you."
5,Comments on The Necessary Grace to Fall,"I liked how descriptive this book was, it was easy to enter in and relate to the characters. Also, I liked that the author wrote about how things are, not how they should be. This book is full of emotion and honesty, and it's surprisingly gritty and humorous."
2,Maybe as poetry...but not so much as stories.,"The author of this collection is a cheerful, cute young woman. She is funny and awfully nice. She lectured to my class once.That being said, yeah, I have never quite understood this book. Her words, they're lovely. They fit together in new and beautiful ways.But...the stories...they don't seem like stories. They just drift and wander in pretty words. They are a bunch of stuff that happened. Nothing to set your teeth into.If you approach this book as poetry, you might be more satisfied with it."
2,average historical romance overshadowed by too much violence,"I could not finish this book. What was only average writing was greatly minimized by the many male characters violence towards the heroine right from page one. Some violence towards the heroine seems par for the course for historical romance written in the 90's but this was was so overwhelmed as to make it unpleasant to read. I also found the stories ""abduction romance"" premise dated, tired, implausible and distasteful. I would not recommend this book.1.5 stars."
2,Not gripping enough for the flight to Los Angeles,"Saved the book for my flight hoping for escape from seatbacks and crying babies. Alas, the introspective, detached narrative of some genuine losers didn't provide the hoped for transendance. That's not to say it's not beautifully, craftily written. Even poetic."
4,Another great collection by Hempel...,"Having read Reasons to Live and Tumble Home, I had looked forward to reading another short fiction collection by Amy Hempel. The Dog of the Marriage deals with subjects that are quite popular in short fiction -- romantic relationships gone awry. However, Hempel adds her own remarkable voice and compelling storytelling to her stories. The stories that touch on the subjects of obsessive love or ruined marriages are the most wonderful ones. My favorite stories are ""Jesus Is Waiting,"" ""The Afterlife,"" ""Memoir,"" ""The Uninvited,"" and ""Offertory."" The aforementioned stories are often dark and heartbreaking. This isn't the best Hempel collection I have read (Reasons to Live, in my opinion, is her most accomplished collection), but it is definitely that I'd recommend to all short fiction lovers out there."
3,The Dog of the Marriage,Not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews. But I'm an old guy. I'd guess it would be appreciated more by college age women. Or women period.
4,Progressive,I enjoyed the book very much. I liked the progressiveness as well. I recommend it to others...very good!
3,Appalling,I didn't read the entire book but I am appalled that your family even speaks to you. I can't believe that you disclosed the type of things you have in your book.
4,Well done,"I thought ""In My Own Skin"" was very well done. Very personal for an outside reader. The readers would be able to feel your words regarding certain issues and to me that is the point. Make them see what you see, feel what you feel. I liked the personal touch."
3,Very Simplistic,This was really a good book of poems. Very nice and simple but straight to the point poetry. The poems remind me of greeting cards. Seems as though that would be a thought.Very creative and most people can relate to the selection of poems in the book. My favorite:Give Me My Flowers While I'm Living
4,Non-pretentious,"""In My Own Skin"" is non-pretentious and an honest progression of life...a collection of truthful snapshots that allow the reader to easily connect."
3,Too Personal...,"I am not much of a book reader. However, I read the book and thought it was ok because it was too personal."
5,"Vivid, touching and moving!","Bridget Watson's ""In My Own Skin"" is a touching and moving collection of poems that not only takes you back but moves you forward. They paint a vivid pictureof her individuality."
5,Willy the Scrub triumphs on its own terms,"WILLY THE SCRUB is just the book you have been waiting for to give to your son or daughter who is interested in sports but can't find good sports books that are accessible to them. Don't be fooled by the book's seemingly simple language or by its gentle humor. In a sophisticated and engaging way, McEwan presents the world of athletics as your children know it to be: a battlefield of egos and status, a minefield of insecurities and disappointment--and yet a place where good-hearted and hard-working friends can find success and happiness. You will love the book for the refreshing and hopeful message it sends to your children. Your children will love it because it shows the world as they know it to be. They will also love the witty and insightful dialogue. Especially recommended for late-elementary school children who are reading slightly under grade level."
1,"Adding hand-weights to Yoga? A wretched, assinine concept.","Using a heavyhand dumbbell for Yoga asanas could only be conceived by somebody who: a) doesn't understand the concept of Heavyhands, and, b) doesn't understand the concept of Yoga.Well, let's face it, Heavyhands is a brilliant form of aerobics. Aerobics! And, for getting the blood and heart going, the addition of the use of handweights is extraordinarily valuable.Now, Yoga? There's nothing absolutely wrong with the addition of weights, but it comes down to - what's the point? Not to mention the fact that the use of handweights reduces the number of yoga positions one can do - reduces them down to a few non-core Yoga exercises, actually.This DVD is a waste of time and money."
3,Not very challenging,"""Lady Hardbody"", the person I train several times a week and the person I bought this DVD for, has worked out twice with this DVD. She has told me she does not find the workout very challenging. This is not meant to slight the product, just to be a statement of fact, although admittedly from somebody who is in extremely good physical condition.http://ladyhardbody.blogsome.com/"
3,"Finally, the Truth About Whitman","Undoubtedly, the most amazing thing about the many Whitman bio's (and there's certainly no shortage of them), is their denial of his homosexuality. This is why Schmmidgall's work stands head and shoulders above them all (including Jerome Loving's seemingly exhaustive bio that doesn't present Whitman as being gay). The trouble with Loving and the rest who would deny Whitman's sexuality is that they are either terribly homophobic, or that they never read any of Whitman's poetry. The only reason I gave the book a three star rating, is because I don't feel it's a good first-Whitman-book to read for the uninitiated. Rather, I would start with his actual poetry, maybe read a popular bio, and then end up with Schmidgall's ""Gay Life""."
3,An okay novel,"This book is set in the Mechwarrior Dark Age universe, but it has none of the mech battles that I love, its more of a spy novel that happens to take place in the stated background."
2,detective novel with drops of Science-Fiction,"I am disappointed with this novel. Not that it would be poorly-written - on the contrary, it is very enjoyable. But I see it as a copy-paste of a detective novel that would have been adapted in the BT universe. There are a few mentions of the Battletech but no `Mech, and the story is set on a single planet that looks too much like 20th Century America to have the feeling of Science-Fiction.And you'll have to give up trying to guess the identity of the murderer: you'll never meet the character before the end."
1,Violent and pointless,"Ilsa J. Bick strikes again, slipping in a trashy, violent, and overly graphic plot, and slapping the Mechwarrior title on it."
2,Not a Battletech Novel,"Despite having ""A Battletech Novel"" printed on the cover, along with the Mechwarrior Dark Age logo, this is not a Battletech novel. This is a murder mystery/intrigue novel wedged into the Battletech universe, with absolutely no relevant connections to the Battletech storyline until the last dozen or so pages. In addition, it has problems even as a spy thriller due to numerous factual (The most egregious of which being that at one point a medical examiner digs a slug out of a body and states that they can identify it by the firing pin mark. Firing pin marks are on the end of the shell casing where the pin strikes the primer, not on the bullet.) and continuity errors. It also suffers from the novice mystery writer's fault of cramming the answer to everything in the last 10 pages instead of building the solution. Overall, a wholly unsatisfactory entry in the Battletech/Mechwarrior library."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY,"The author apparently knows absolutely nothing about Mechwarrior. If you're looking for Mech action or a continuation of the Mechwarrior storyline, you won't find either in this book. This book was a complete and utter disappointment. It's not even a good murder mystery as it was so poorly written."
4,"Not the best Bette films, but worth a watch!","The three main actors in this film are potentially wonderful! I was somewhat disappointed by Paul Henried's role (he is usually a stronger character); Bette Davis could also have been better compared to other parts; on the other hand (and as stated in another review), Claude Rains is just excellent (he seems to be able to 'rise' above the mediocrity of a role) - this is a film about classical music, personalities, and deception (hence the tile) - well worth a watch; probably would have gone 3+*, if possible, but because of the actors decided on 4* - any film w/ Bette needs to be watched at least once - :-)"
5,ADORE!,"I ADORE Bette Davis and this newest boxed set collection has excellent art work! It also has several more of my favorite films such as All This and Heaven Too and Deception. This is a beautiful package with purposeful attention to the Bette Davis ""eyes"" on the front cover. It's extraordinary! I do hope they put Dangerous and some of her earlier films in the next set. Thank you Warner Brothers! Thumps up to you!"
4,Great collection...,"Theres nothing i can add here that hasnt been said...except...It seems to me that Mary Astor (the great) seems the be the only actress that Davis was over shadowed by in any of her films, which makes the film they made together a must-see."
4,Good value for Davis fans,"All of these films are worth watching if you are Davis fan because she is such a charismatic actress. Most are ""B"" grade, except ""Watch on the Rhine."" The purchase price was worth it for that movie alone, but my husband & I enjoyed watching all of these during the holidays."
4,bette davis collection vol 3.,I have always been a fan of bette davis and I have found his set to be great.The fims are all remastered and the sound his good. So I thorougly reccomend this set .I also purchased it when the price was reduced.Ken Barrett Mooroolbark Victoria Australia .
5,Love bette davis films. Was hard to find these tiltles.,"Thank god, Amazon had these tiltles available, it was hard to find these titles on DVD. I would have to wait until cable decided to show these films.Thanks Amazon!"
3,A missed opportunity,"Although I am very happy that In This Our Life is finally out on DVD, I felt the other selections were rather banal choices. Why did they have to put Watch On The Rhine in this set? A very tedious talky sactimonius piece of WWII propaganda, which is not even a Davis vehicle. All This and Heaven Too although a box office success in it's day, is rather long and overdrawn. Why not have included Dangerous and Beyond The Forest in this set? Some out there may turn their noses up at the thought of these two films being included in a Bette Davis boxed set--indeed, even Davis admitted to hating these films--but her performances still hold up today, and would have made a good juxtiposition between the young Davis spitfire persona and her latter day turn at a no-holds barred middle-aged vixen. I wonder who puts these packages together???The Bette Davis Collection, Vol. 3 (The Old Maid / All This, And Heaven Too / The Great Lie / In This Our Life / Watch on the Rhine / Deception)"
4,Good....but not her Best!!!,Well let me say that I really love Sparkle...this album has the same kind of flow as her first album; the one she did with R.Kelly.At the same time I think that Sparkle puts her feelings into her work and I love that.Her voice is not the kind of voice you hear all the time. Believe me this cd may have to do with what she has gone through in her life as far as relationships goes....but this cd is a groove type of cd that will have you in the mood for you know what...I can honestly say that her the one she did with R. Kelly was a lil better than this!
1,BAD WOMAN,"I did not liked this book, because she did a bad thing (Pearl).she did not respect the man that had orders to cut the tree and she fooled him by making him eat and by telling him a story about her family's photos."
1,pearl moscowitz's last stand,pearl moscowitz's last standis about a women that came to the united state. that lives in gingko street that begens to renew the place like planting trees. then named the street pearl street. the grade that gave to this book is a 100. I recomend this book to the kids that like to read interesred books li pearl moscowit's last stand.
5,Watchin' Sanchin,"If you want to see how sanchin is performed to the Nth degree get this DVD. But this DVD does not teach sanchin kata, it only shows how it is done by a great Uechi-ryu master. The filming is first rate and as clean as a whistle. Though the kata is not taught on this DVD, anyone studying the form, especially Uechi-ryu students, would benefit greatly by studyng this DVD. The first part is an historical account of Okinawa and of the man who brought Pangai Noon (Uechi-ryu) to Okinawa, Kanbun Uechi. Following this, Sanchin is performed from several angles, along with the testing of form by hitting and kicking the performers. Then there is the breaking of boards: 2 by 2's, stacks of 1 by 12's, and 2 by 4's. This is a great DVD for anyone who is interested in seeing what the real thing is."
3,Nice but too tightly packed,"It took me twice the time to remove all the twist-ties and other packaging from the carton than it did to assemble the whole mobile. I love the bright colors, music is cute and loud but it doesn't quite grab the attention of my 3-month old for very long. I really only got this to go with the All-star theme nursery but I could have done without it."
2,NICE BUT NOT FOR MY CRIB,"i LOVED THIS MOBILE AND IT MATCHED THE BEDDING AND ROOM PERFECTLY, BUT WHEN I WENT TO PUT IT ON MY SONS CRIB IT DIDN'T FIT."
4,Worth the price,For $10.00 this toy isn't so bad compared to some of Lego's prices these days. The little clone trooper is pretty cool. He comes with a little black gun with a clear blue stud piece on the end. The walker is ok. The problem is the feet move backwards. But other wise it is not a big problem.I enjoy bending both of the legs straight back until they are parallel to the walker. Then I take both feet and look towards the very end of each foot. There is a bending piece. I bend this up on both of the feet to turn it into a ship to use in the air. A pretty good toy overall. Great for a collection.
5,The clone wars at st,This looks like a cool toy but I don't have and hopefully i'll get it for christmas. I'm asking for two because two would go good with the clone turbo tank and wookie attack. my brother is asking for the wookie catamaran it'll make a cool kashyk battle idea. welp I can't wait till christmas marry christmas.
5,Excellent little set,I happen to find this one for my son for Christmas at the last minute...our stores here had stopped carrying it. Thanks Amazon! My 7 yr old put this together himself quite quickly. He really likes it and it seems quite sturdy.
3,NOT SOLAR POWERED,"The title of this product has solar in it...but it is not solar powered. It needs a standard outlet. I bought it for my garden and will need to run a cord. However, if you are not concerned with it being non-solar powered, it is very attractive and works great. If I were looking for an electrical powered fountain I would of gave this 5 stars."
3,Several were reviewed.,"I am a St. John's Wort user... I ,however, take it 'to curb my desire for junk food.' I also had been told that there was a side effect connected to SUNLIGHT? Can your experts clarify this? I would also like to know about long term use - side effects on the blood?? Yes it is a great Mood Elevator - that is how I keep from stress eating. But give credit where it is due - people who are not depressed could inprove their JOY by it's use also, right? Dieters - health nuts - teenagers? So ""broaden the views and improve the news"" - St. John's Wort - does much to improve joy. (En joy ment)"
3,Note the dimensions!,"Note that this is 1.5 inches in diameter and since most sink holes are cut to 1.5 inches, this will fall into the hole and not cover it. That is why other sink hole covers have a diameter of 1 5/8 inches."
1,Advanced?,"They entitle this Advanced All Grain Brewing. If you consider banging two rocks together as advanced, then this is your video. This should most certainly be renamed to All Grain Brewing The Very Basics. As that is what it was. They spent far too much time going over equipment than actual brewing procedures, and actually used some techinques deemed unsuitable in the brewing world. I was looking to expand my all grain knowledge with this video and was sadly mistaken. If you know anything at all about all grain brewing this video is not for you."
2,Just ok,"This CD was not as good as expected, in fact I gave it away. I was very disappointed because I generally like Loretta Lynn & Conway Twitty."
2,Weak Treatment of Shroud,"According to the description, I expected this video to go in depth with the latest scientific inquiries into the nature of the shroud. I was hoping it would even discuss the now-defunc 1988 carbon dating of the shroud. However, this video is so old that it appears to have been made prior to the 1988 carbon dating - they do not even tell you the results at the end. This video is woefully out of date and ends up sounding more like a badly-produced high-school science video. The discussion centers more around how carbon dating works, and less around how that matters in the authentication of the shroud. I think they pieced this video together from several other programs since only 1/4 of deals directly with the shroud. Also, the video quality is poor."
2,Never again.,"This stuff forms a bond to your car and wheels that you like to NEVER get off. The spray collects on the wheels and then all of your brake dust will collect in it making your tires Waaaaaaaaaay dirty and this stuff is impossible to get off. I Will never use this again...I'm looking for things to simplify my life,not add to the work !"
2,EH......,This stuff starts running right when you drive. It's just terrible. The Black Magic in the spray bottle works better and last way longer. This stuff takes time to put on and gets messy plus it attracts everything it comes into contact with.
1,Caused more problems than solved,"For the first week this seemed very comfortable but after about a month of using it I had developed such a terrible crick in my neck that I couldn't put my head back for the pain, which went well down into my left shoulder. I stopped using it and the pain went away within a few days and I regained full mobility in my neck. It's really too low and flat on its own but bolstered up with another pillow made it too high. I do NOT recommend!"
1,Not at all what I purchased,"I had purchased a 4 pound serta contour pillow, what I recieved was a 1 pound contour pillow, maker of unknown origin, because the tags had been torn off! Reordered again & received the same WRONG pillow.I will be very hesitant in ordering from Amazon again!Serta 4-Pound Density Memory Foam Contour Pillow by Sleep Innovations"
1,Ouch!...(still),"This didn't do it for me. I am a side sleeper and was looking for something to fill the space between my neck and the mattress. This just didn't do it. It offers no support at all. Perhaps that is the idea behind ""memory foam"" in the first place. I am not sure, but for now it's back to smushing the down pillows to fill the gap and prevent the morning stiff neck."
2,pillow,"was not as happy with this as I thought I would be, it is too soft, no structure to it. I have another of these I just love but it is much firmer than this one. this one does not give you any support under your neck when you are sleeping, it immediately flattens to nothing."
3,I like it once I learned how to use it.,It took me a week of not great sleep to figure out that I liked it better if I flipped it over and slept on the back side of it. Like it fine now. I especially like how firm it is and it's not going flat over night.
3,"Decent pillow, but it is not memory foam.","Since I chose to take a chance on this pillow despite the other negative reviews, I will refrain from rating it any lower. However, it is advertised as a ""memory"" foam pillow and it is not. It is much softer than the other memory foam pillows or cushions that we own, and it is quite smelly. I am hoping that airing it out for a few days will take care of that issue. All in all, it is not a bad pillow, but it is also not what is advertised."
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"I bought a pair of this 4lb Serta pillow, and I have to say that I was really really disappointed about this product.First of all, I could not find any tag on the products stating that it's from ""Serta"". Apparetnly, it should have 2 tags on the products. One of the brand tag was removed when it was delivered, and the other brand tag was crossed out by pen. I looked carefully what was written under neath of it. It says ""Serta International"". I'm not sure ""Serta International"" is the same company as Serta, the brand that everyone knows.Secondly, i don't believe that it's 4lb memory foam. It was really soft and was not comfortable at all. So I went to other local stores (Bed Bath & beyond, Kohl, and JC Penny) that priced around $20-$40 for memory foam pilows to try out. They were much better than Amazon's 4lbs Serta products for sure.I strongly suggest you not to buy this products."
1,Returned,"I opened the box it came in, felt the pillow, layed down on it and put it right back in the box. Poor quality. Went out and bought the original Temper-Pedic pillow. Lesson: you get what you pay for."
5,Very Enjoyable!,"I read Pretence of Love by Carol Gregor and I liked it very much, it is about a young lady named Bella Latham who reluctantly agrees to impersonate her identical twin sister who is a model and actress so her spoiled sister can take off but while impersonaing her sister Bella runs into unforseen complications as she falls for Luke Retford and she is afraid to tell him the truth because she knows he will not like her deception. This book is great and the plot's locations include England, Wales and an island called Mauritius, I recommend this book to any Harlequin Romance book fan."
1,not worth the read,It took me almost two weeks to read it. It was not developedenough. The story was more about the navy than the love story.
3,LIGHT READING,"INTERESTED IN LIGHT, CLEAN READING WITH ABSOLUTELY NO SEXUAL CONTENT; THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU... WANT HOT STEAMY SEXUAL CONTENT, YOU'LL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED.COMING FROM AN AUTHOR THAT WRITES CHILDREN'S BOOKS, THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK FOR PRETEENS THAT ARE JUST BEING INTRODUCED TO CONTEMPORARY ROMANCE."
1,HORRIBLE!,It took me about 4 days to read this book and I did that by skipping some pages. The love story was not developed at all. The story was about two people trying to cope in a relationship while seperated. The love scences were not there at all. One of the worst stories I have read all year.
4,An Amazing Candid Expose,"I found The Truth on Modeling by Erin Pinckney to be an amazing and honest resourse for young hopefuls to gain insight into getting started. It is so difficult for beginners to know where to begin and Ms Pinckney tells it like it is. The so called ""glamor"" of the industry overshadows the fundamentals needed to get started and this author seems to have her hand right on the pulse. I recommend the book for any parent who has a child interested in a modeling career."
4,"LOVED IT! Honest, realistic and not full of junk info...","The great thing about this book is that you don't have to sift through the makeup and photography and skincare sections(like some other modeling books)to get to the real information. This book is ALL info and no fluff. My mom bought it for me and I am glad that she did! I continue to refer to it as I try to enter the modeling industry, it's got some really good information.I particularly like the fact that the model/author is not a ""supermodel"" and gives a unique and realistic perspective. A good book...read it:)"
2,Bo-ring!,"This movie was really...stupid. I guess if you really like softcore porn, this would be perfect, since that's what it is. But keep in mind, it doesn't show ""anything""; it's like watching naked people make out, and that's it. It was fun to watch and laugh at with my friends, with the bad acting and all."
3,Seem to work,These gloves seem to work as designed. You'll get reasonable protection and they look like they will last reasonably well.
3,"Dewalt DPG20L All Purpose Synthetic Leather Palm Spandex Back Velcro Wrist Work Glove, Large",Glove is OK the large size fits well. they are on the thin side so lets see how long they last. to be continued.
2,"Nice design, but questionable durability.","I like the design and materials, but the seams are weak. Please see my image posted above. The seam separated after a few hours of light yard work."
3,Good gloves,"I purchased these gloves around Thanksgiving and have used them until June. I work in the delivery industry nothing too demanding on the gloves, mainly need to protect my hands from dirt and dryness. I rated them 3 stars only because I expected them to last longer. The seams in the stitching on the top comes apart fairly quickly and later the palms. For 11 bucks I cant really complain much, they did serve their purpose. Overall a good pair of gloves to buy."
2,Lightweight,"Feels good on your hands. Useful for most tasks. The only problem is the side of the fingers has a thin stretchy mesh material that has ripped twice on two separate fingers. I stitched it up with some thread so they are still in use, but c'mon, who designed these. Avoid these if you will be handling any sharp edges."
3,They stain everything,"These gloves might work out OK if all you plan on doing is digging in the yard or something, but if you're going to be handling materials that might be lacquered, painted, or otherwise finished, beware that the material on the palms pills up and leaves big black smudges all over everything. I think I'll stick to the all-leather cheapies."
1,sewn small or tagged wrong,"dewalt glove was really a medium or large size glove with x large size tag clipped on..... i was fully expecting a proper fitting glove which i had purchased before from stores......this pair is worthless for my use which i needed...i will pass on down to a size fitting co worker.... when buying this glove, one should buy at a dealer store if product is on inventory...can be found at farmer/rancher stores across the midwest...try the glove on first before purchasing...hold out to shop for this item personally...manufacturers seem to keep changing specs as far as sizing goes...XLarge should be a man's size 5 or 11 depending on scale with room to spare in fingers and palm.....glove is sold at dewalt stores, but much higher price then online shopping or independent dealers...you have to try on clothes for proper fit including gloves nowadays"
1,Tear Easily,"Horrible. The first time I wore these, they tore at the seam between glove and wrist. Don't buy. I shouldn't have."
2,Not for my use.,"I would recommend this product to anyone doing just mild yard work or maybe something else light.These gloves were used for picking up logs, climbing trees, heavy raking, and tons on country clean up.I wouldn't buy these gloves again maybe for a child just for protection.These gloves are just okay. I've never written a review. SoDon't exactly know what to out but what these gloves can handle.I put maybe 30-40 hours of use on them and the fingers started to rip and the threading started to come apart.I really liked how they fit snug and broke in nicely. I really liked them but they couldn't hold up to tree work and heavy yard work. Well. This is my review. Good gloves for mild to easy work and they are very nice gloves. Just wear very fast. Thanks!"
3,very small,"i would give these a better rating but they are so small. I bought the extra large and they are way too small, if you have small hands these are the gloves for you."
4,VERY Durable,"Not Water proof by any means, but then again, it never claims to be. Not for cold weather either. other than that, it has lasted me over a year of working as the Hazmat Supervisor of the USS Normandy... That says quite a bit!"
2,"For me, not so much","Got these as a present and you don't really tell a 6 year old their present was lacking.All in all, they do protect your hands from splinters and cuts but I never felt they were agile enough to grab screws and nails with them. But if you're going to be working with water, working in snow or it starts to rain you'll probably want to go in a different direction. It seemed like they took forever to dry out. Mine started to rip about two months after I got them and I assume it has to do with the amount of moisture and drying they had to go through but I couldn't swear by it."
4,Great Gloves for Most Uses,These are the gloves I like best for outdoor work. They fit well - and are not clumsy like some older style gloves are. The one disadvantage that I have noticed of knit-fabric gloves like these is that thorns (like from rose or citrus trees) can go right through them (ouch!) if you are not careful.
4,Heavy Duty,I am remodling my home and use these gloves quite often. They have held up without any problems. I recommend these for any one that could use a good pair of work gloves.
5,good fit and grip,"these gloves have a nice fit, not too tight either. I have used them extensively in logging work, they have held up better than natural leather gloves. Would recommend them."
5,Great cleaner,This is a great cleaner. I got this mainly because it has no chemicals. It really cleans well. I have no complaints.
3,its nice,"Each time I used my old (and quite famous) cleanly product with bleach, I would find bleach stains on my clothing in the weirdest places. Not due to that reason, but this month, I switched brands...because of price."
1,Don't like the scent,"I didnt use it, found the scent offensive. I went the the store and bought another scent that I like."
4,Cats Don't Like the Smell,"I bought this to spray on the corners of walls and door openings where our cat likes to rub constantly. Serves the purpose beautifully, and cleans the wall well without a lot of harsh chemicals."
3,Dime sized pendant,"I bought this beautiful pendant for two reasons. We Never Ever can afford to forget what happened on 9-11, and two, because my son is a firefighter and I want to wear this pendant as a tribute and reminder to everyone I come across. Those brave men and women who rushed into the burning, smoking towers risked it all, gave their all on American soil and also sacrificed forever, the quality of life of their family and survivors endevoring to render aid. We Must NEVER Forget any of them.I wish this beautiful pendant was a bit larger, and make a note, it does not come with a chain."
3,Handy,"As a beginner teacher I found this book useful to fill in gaps in my own knowledge. It has step by step instructions for all basic art programs and is a good benchmark for when you are setting up your own programs. Things like plaster casting, clay modeling, pinhole photography, watercolours etc all have units of work. Although I did not use whole units I did use parts of the program to help create a foundation for my own work. Not a book you'd use everyday, but definately handy. I wish I had found it in my first year of teaching!"
3,"Great book for advanced art classes, but not for studio art","As a first year teacher I bought this book to help me out with the school year. There are many good projects in here for advanced classes, such as drawing and painting, sculpture, etc. However in this day in age its really sad that half the projects I would want to do for my studio classes I can't because they involve using knives, irons, etc. Its just to dangerous and I hate I have to think about my students stealing knives. Overall this book is great if you are able to teach advanced classes at the High School level. I would not recommend this book if you teach regular studio."
2,not a great resource if you've been to art school,"I purchased this early last fall before my first semester teaching high school art. While I was looking for a listing of interesting ideas, I found few interesting & creative lessons I would actually use in instructing. If you haven't attended art school, perhaps this would be enlightening, but for me, it showed me how much I learned in foundations."
2,Outdated and Not Detailed Enough,"I was excited to order this book thinking it would be a time saver and great help if I was stuck for a lesson. The concept of the book is great especially for new teachers like myself, however the lessons are terribly outdated and not very motivating. Darkroom photography, seriously??? The good thing is that I have now been inspired to write my own, complete with assessments and enrichment activities. This book is past it's sell-by date :-("
3,Fear and Loathing in Mythgarth,"As you read The Knight , you find yourself unable to put it down but not for the usual reason , that is what will happen next , but simply trying to decipher what has happened so far.Without much of prelude Gene Wolf plunges you into his world of uber fantasy where nothing is what is seems and time and space loose their essential properties.This world is psychedelic jambalaya of venues , events and characters whose sheer number surpasses epics such as '100 years of solitude' .In the center of it all is the main character Able of the High Heart a man who is a boy whose every character trait are contradiction on its own.Perhaps this book should have been named ""Fear and loathing in Mythgarth"
1,The Knight,"What a complete disappointment. I honestly feel robbed. I have not read a single Gene Wolfe novel so I can't speak for any of his preceding oeuvre but The Knight was positively awful. I bought this book to read on the way back from Memphis to Toronto. After struggling through the first 100 pages, I couldn't stand it any longer and tossed the book in the garbage at a layover in Detroit. How the publisher managed to pull together enough positive press clippings to convince me to buy this book I'll never know. Perhaps Neil Gaiman, in particular I will never trust again!"
1,Just plain awful!,"This is the first book I've read by Gene Wolfe. Is he over 10 years old? I ask because the prose and plot structure remind me of an epileptic 10-year old I know. It's terrible writing, not a ""re-working"" of the genre as some have claimed. It's also nothing close to Faulkner, as others have claimed.It's simple disjointed writing and an outright silly story. About halfway through I started laughing at the ridiculous writing and plot points. If this book is intended to be slapstick, it succeeds. If it's intended to be a decent story, it fails. Very few motivations are explained or understandable; very few descriptions are interesting, and the character is thoroughly unengaging. There's a lot of plot, and a lot of movement, but that only shows the poor quality of writing.This book made me into a hero for completing the arduous quest to finish reading it. Where's my magical sword?"
1,Poorly Written,"I only want to echo what others have said about this book, it does not flow at all. I struggled to make it through the first 100 pages and then finally gave up."
2,INCOHERENT WORD JUMBLE,"Luckily I have found very few bad books over the past few years. Unfortunately Mr. Wolfe's THE KNIGHT happens to be one of them. Not so much that the premise of the story is bad, in fact if it were well written it would probably be fairly enjoyable. But it isn't, well written that is. What we have here is a four hundred and thirty page mind-numbing word jumble. Characters flit in and out of the storyline with little or no rhyme or reason, the plot itself is not just difficult but torturous to follow. Early on you start to wonder if there is a point to the book but by the end you are sure there isn't.No sense is dragging this out; this book is not worth the time or the effort. There are much better, well actually there are a great many better fantasy's, spend your time with them, this one is NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,disappointing and disjointed,"This was the first book I have read by the ""great"" Gene Wolfe who I had never heard of, but this book was extremely disappointing and disjointed and how many times have we seen people from the ""now"" vaulted back into a fantasy/sci-fi situation and people say Wolfe is ""original."" This has been done to death and all the references to ""America"" and playing video games were disgusting. The book was also very, very slow and quite boring! I found myself constantly thinking of other things while reading the book rather then being immersed into the novel as you would be a great author like Jordan, Martin, Brooks, Eddings or Weis/Hickman.I would most definitely NOT recommend this book and based on this book I would not recommend the author either. Luckily, I checked this out from the library and did not pay for it."
1,"Wow, this really blew","This book contains many of the right ingredients for a good fantasy tale; unfortunately, the most interesting parts are merely mentioned instead of being the focus. I was intrigued by the positive reviews, but was soon to realize: I had been deceived. The Knight plods along at tiring pace: Wolfe's character development is paper thin with inconsistent and tedious explanations of who, what, when, where and why. I gave up with 15 pages till the end (I just didn't care). I find it interesting that many reviewers feel it is necessary to use this forum as a soap box: only those of superior intellect and imagination can truly appreciate this book. Sorry, The Knight really isn't the right book to use as proof of literary competence.--jAMES"
2,Failed to engage with the characters,"I have loved many of his previous works but this one failed to keep me interested. In fact I ground to a halt about three quaters of the way through. While well crafted, the narrative is not terribly linear and can get quite abstract. I'm generally not afraid to put in the effort to an alternatively constructed novel but the vagueness of what was happening and the lack of any clear direction for the story over half way through the book made any pay off seem unlikely (especially as this is a series). To me this resonated with ""A catcher in the rye"", which although aclaimed left me pretty cold. I respect the intellect behind it and even wish I had the skills to create it, but in the end this was not an enjoyable read."
2,Terrible writing,"I found that book really dissapointing. The writing makes it hard to really feel anything for the characters which act stupidly most of the time or they figure out stuff out of thin air. The concept of the multiple worlds on top of each other is interesting, but is not exploited really well. I can't recommend to read this book."
1,Stopped on page 158,"As I was looking for a new book to read I came across this one which was on a few ""Must Read"" lists and it also had good reviews...so I thought I'll give it a try.After 158 pages I couldn't take it anymore, I actually looked Gene Wolfe up on Wikipedia to make sure he wasn't a retarded kid with ADD. His ""writing style"" consists of a disjointed plot, a lot of ""you won't believe it, so I won't describe it"" lines, and the most humdrum storyline ever thought up (kid wants to be knight, kid magically becomes knight, knight goes on quest).Perhaps this book gets better after page 158...I'll never know.Do yourself a favor and save your time and money. Gene Wolfe owes me $7.99 plus S/H for this piece of cr**."
3,None,"this book is very creative. I have never read a book in the format gene wolfe has written this novel in. I really enjoyed this book, but I just wish the ending was better."
2,"Well written in a different style, but hard to follow","I am a huge fantasy fan and have read a lot of them. This book was well written in a unique writing style, but failed to ever immerse me in the plot. The plot often moves slowly and jumps all over the place. At times it seemed to me to be a series of thinly connected short stories rather than one coherent plot. I considered putting it down after 150 pages and when I finished it, in retrospect, I probably should have."
2,"Please, no more","There aren't many fantasy books that I don't finish. The Knight is certainly imaginative, but I cannot seem to get into it due to the childish first person narrative. It is going to a library..."
3,Not reading the sequel,"It was my fist Wolfe book and probably my last. It's not bad but it is very difficult to engage with the main character, he just bounce from situtation to situation with no real aim, there is no big vilain, no big conflict that must be resolved, no love interest, little action, complicated unexplained magic. The quality writting keeps you into the book or else I would have put it down half way through, but the story is not strong enough for me to get the sequel."
2,Didn't last long!,"I gave this to my husband for Christmas. It was very nice, but by August, it was dead. We replaced the batteries, but a day later, there was no light -- apparently something isn't charging right."
4,It's nice and works fine...,"We got our house but there was no house number. Didn't bother me at first but when I ask for pizza delivery they would comment that they had a hard time looking for the house. Plus the fact, at night it would be hard to give directions to our house without a house number to start with. Finally, got this one because I like that it blends with the frontyard.It served it's purpose but found the same kind at a store at a much lower price, I'm just not exactly sure if they would be same quality. Anyway, I'm happy with this one..."
5,Oh My Gosh Awesome!,I'm a cow collector so having a this game it fun. Simple game for the whole family! We have a blast!
4,My two-year old adores this book.,"My two-year old daughter adores this book. Picking up the telephone receiver and speaking to the characters really engages her in the story. It has more personal meaning to her than other books in this series. My only complaint is the construction. Eager little hands can easily tear the interactive parts, since they are constructed of light cardboard. I carefully supervise her when we read to keep things intact."
2,Burl Ives--Lavendar Blue,"The CD skips in quite a few places. I am disappointed in its quality. It did it the first time played, so is defective. I have not opened the other cd's I purchased. They are gifts, so I am rather nervous as to the quality of them. I hope they are okay. Thank you for the opportunity to let you know. I love Burl Ives voice and most of the selections on this particular cd that was for my own collection. Anne"
1,Not very comfortable,"Pro: The watch has great functions like a special timer for interval training and the nike special function that turns the watch to a hibernate mode after a selected amount of time to extend battery life. Looks tough and rugged, except for the color (pink and purple, yes that is what color it is).Con: Ya, it doesn't look like it on the site, but when my wife opened the box she asked why I bought a pink and purple watch. The next day someone at work asked the same thing, I haven't worn it since. It is also very uncomfortable to wear with anything with long sleeves, especially with a jacket. The watch has a sticky rubber finish which makes it grab cloth. I wouldn't recommend it. Also, the restocking fee for returning it was like %35 so I'm just going to sell it online as used."
2,assembly nightmare,"I purchased this model because the last one I purchased from another maker didn't last. However this one was a big hassle to assemble. I t might be impossible for someone who didn't have some mechanical aptitude. The assembly instructions were incorrect,both the illustration and directions and I had to drill my own starter holes for the wood screws since they were inaccurately marked. The lady I spoke with when I called was nice enough but they apparently don't sell enough of these to get complaints. Once it was assembled and I cooled off, it SEEMS to be okay. Let's see how long this one lasts."
3,needs to do more research,"As a historian, I was excited to read this book. Beginning to read it, however, the author wrote that Santana was born in 1947. He then states that Carlos returned to his home town in 1986 for his 53rd birthday. The author also makes a major mistake recounting the legend of our Blessed Virgen de Guadalupe, stating that the bishop was sent to investigate her appearance, and that her image appeared on his cloak. It was, in fact Juan Diego who was sent back to her to bring proof of her existence and it was his cloak that her image appeared on. The rest of the book was soured by these early inaccuracies. One wonders what other inaccuracies are listed as fact regarding Carlos Santana. It just goes to show you can't always believe what you read."
5,Oxford Shorter English Dictionary,"This is the best English dictionary of its size, and a bargain at $Aus34 delivered still in shrink wrapping. Thank you once again Amazon."
4,"excellent , but the cd-rom is a problem","It certainly is one of the best dictionaries available. But its cd-rom cannot be installed in a desktop or laptop. THis will severely undermine its attractiveness. Consequently, while I bought this dictionary, I still need to buy a cd-rom from Random House Unbridged and Collins Cobuild Adavanced Learner's since it is more convenient to look up the electronic version while writing on the computer."
4,better than expected,"The book came promptly as described plus more, the book was in great shape, box a little banged up, but I expected more wear and tear for a used item, price very nice, thanks for the quick response."
3,Disappointing Word Coverage,"I continue to be let down by the words I do not find in the Shorter OED, 5th Edition. I can not find common grape varietals. Today I couldn't find colonoscopy or coloscopy. I do not use my dictionary that often, but so far, I would say I have a 75% failure rate to find words that I am after."
5,The Ultimate Dictionary,"I have had other dictionaries, however for getting to the grass roots meaning of a particular word, this is the dictionary to have on the bookshelf. It settles all disputes over the correct meaning of words. The CD Rom is excellent as I have it loaded in both my home computer and work laptop."
2,Big is not always better,"You know somebody's in trouble when a dictionary published in 2002 and selling for over $100 does not give a definition for the word ""download."""
2,There are still defective copies in circulation,"I am very upset with this 2 volume dictionary by Oxford. Having read previous reviews dated back to 2003 on defective copies, I was hoping that in 2005 there would be no more defective copies in circulation.However, after receiving my copy I am missing pages 1122-1171 and 1219-1221 missing from the 1st volume. From the 2nd volume I have pages 1795-1828 inserted between pages 3692 and 3705.I contacted Amazon and they are sending me a replacement copy. They let me keep the defective copies as the shipping costs were too expensive for Amazon to reimburse me.If the replacement copies are defective again, I will ask Amazon for a refund.If you are planning on purchase a copy, be careful, check the other reviews for potential defects. Remember you always have the option for a refund."
5,Highly Recommended!,"If B. Eugene Griessman wanted a good subtitle for this book of time-saving tactics, he could use, ""Time waits for no one."" He offers many common-sense pointers on how to avoid wasting your time - and how to keep others from wasting it, too. It's eye-opening to realize and calculate the value and importance of every hour, even your leisure time. People in all walks of life - students, stay-at-home parents, business leaders, teachers, self-employed workers - can glean ideas for using time effectively from this book. If you are a procrastinator, this book will encourage you to ""do it now."" While some of the suggestions here may seem too simplistic to those who already employ some time-management tactics, we [...] recommend this book for inveterate - if inadvertent - time-wasters. You know who you are."
3,"Dissappointing, yet a good read.","My perspective is colored by the fact that I have taken professional training in time management (both through work and privately), and work as a project manager in high tech.I found this book very useful, in that it covered many useful techniques. However, most of the information is not focused on time management per se, rather on how to be successful in life.Chapter 2 contains 5 pages of tactics on using ""to-do"" lists, the heart of time management. Elsewhere, the subject of avoiding wasting time is covered, although if you have a tendency in this direction, I doubt this book will change your life.The rest of the book covers such (important) topics as managing staff (ch. 11), increasing personal efficiency (ch. 4), managing projects (ch. 13), etc. These subjects each deserve their own book. For that matter, so does the subject of tactics to better manage your time, which is what I mistakely presumed I was getting."
5,One of the More Interesting Books on Time Management,"I have a variety of books on time management, and quite a few of them are pretty boring to read. Several of the books are just lists of tips on what to do, which often are very similar from book to book. This book was actually interesting to read all the way through almost like a novel because of the human interest stories of how different successful people manage their time. I enjoyed reading the book and best of all it did really did help me to start getting more things done - more so than most of the other books I've read on the subject. My other favorite time management books are Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy and How to Get Control of Your Time and Your Life by Alan Lakein."
3,Some keen observations and some very obvious ones,Is the book worth reading? Well... Yeah. Is it the holy grail of time management far from it.
5,The Nanny Express,Good movie. Does a really good job dealing with subject ofnew person in a motherless home. Good acting by the youngeractors.
5,Great movies for family viewing,"There is something for everyone in this movie. It shows love, compassion, trust and other feelings and how to display and appreciate them."
5,the Nanny Express,"This movie captured your attention right from the beginning with the 2 kids and their tricks on their nannies. They keep up the jokes all the way through the movie, but then show that they can learn to be obedient. The Nanny shows her life with her ill father and best friend, whom she confides with on a daily basis. It also shows her kindness to other children in helping them with their homework. and continuing to get her teaching degree. My grandkids and I love to watch this movie over and over."
5,Awesome Movie!,"Good, clean and at least 2 hours of anticipation! It opened my eyes to how it could be with losing a parent at a young age. Most of us can probably associate the anger and lash-outs directed at someone that takes the place of one that used to be the star of your eye per se in a relationship/marriage ordeal...but through in taking the place of a child's mother (or father)... I couldn't imagine the pain.... The only thing that left me curious is...what if the nanny hadn't lost her mother at a young age...would the mom/daughter relationship have ever worked out, or would a undeniable love between a man and a woman been thrown away indefinitelyuntil such time that the daughter healed, if ever? I know some people that still don't have scars from loss of a parent...so they have never healed..."
4,Nathan,"Great movie full of wonderful entertainment and a moving story. Love does move mountains, in this case a very hurt your girl. I highly recommend this movie."
1,Don't Get Ripped Off!,"I purchased a dvd from MovieMars Storefront and it turned out to be a glorified bootleg copy with bad music. Unfortunately I did not find out until months later, dvd only played twice! - BUYERS BEWARE! MovieMars would not let me exchange or return it. Poor customer service. I will be reluctant to purchase from Amazon."
2,I though it would be understood?,"This book wasn't the best offering I have ever had. It was very poorly written and hard to understand. This fact is proven when they are discussing the city roads and you can't follow a thing. On the other hand there is a load of information, but it is not worth it. I only got through have the book. It was incredibly hard to follow, and there were little explanations for the things that happened. It included information that was never neccesary. This book isn't worth picking up. Unfortunately there aren't many othr books on the case."
1,How about some Corporate downsizing,"Uninspired dreck. I'm a fan of Playboy's Eros Collection, but this offering was weak. The girls of course are hot, but the sex is mechanical: The girls strip, fondle briefly, and dive below. I may be wrong here, but passion doesn't have to be below the waist. How about some deep kissing? Next to the Seventh Sense, this was Eros' weakest offering. If you want to watch a decent Eros flick, rent/buy Allyson is Watching, or The Night that Never Happenend. Pass on this one."
5,What more could you ask for?,"Nice story. Good casting. Impressive acting. Lovely, sexy ladies to look at. What more could you ask for? Well, of course, I was expecting more action from the leading ladies. From past exposures, they had more than satisfied my needs, but this time, they were kind of ""laid back"" so to speak. The ""extras"" furnished most of the exciting action, and it was great. It's just that I had anticipated watching the leading ladies do ""their stuff"" and there just wasn't enough action from them to satisfy my needs, this time.I must say though, this is a nice CLASSY production, enjoyable to watch. Just a little TOO nice for a dirty old man like myself. [:-("
3,A Good Value for Something Different,"If any of the six tracks on this disc were to appear on, say, something by Pat Metheny or Red House Painters, critics would be foaming at the mouth with rave reviews. Instead, it serves as a pleasant diversion for Yo La Tengo fans. Which is a testament to just how talented and diverse they are and makes you appreciate them as perhaps the best band your friends may never hear. A little bit experimental, a little bit fusion, a lot of intriguing, Danelectro works. The remixes are decidedly different and thoughtfully mixed. Not for everyone, but an easy addition to any YLT fan's collection."
3,Get the version sold by Amazon,"Quicken WillMaker (formerly published by NOLO) 2005 is a minor update, but it's always a good idea to get the latest version so it reflects the latest state laws. (But estate laws don't change often...)[...]"
5,Regency romance/fantasy/mystery,"This is the sequel toMairelon the Magician. A couple of years after Mairelon (known in society as Richard Merrill) discovers Kim and takes her on as his apprentice, they're living in London with his prim and proper aunt.When Kim discovers someone breaking into Mairelon's house, attempting to steal a particular book, it leads them into a mystery involving the disappearance of people with minor magical talent, hidden treasure, and ultimately the theft of Mairelon's power, leaving novice Kim to handle the magical part of their investigations.In the meanwhile, Mairelon's mother and his disapproving aunt are busy introducing a reluctant Kim to Society. When she begins to be courted by young men, she realizes it's Mairelon she's really in love with.One of the other reviewers called this ""J. K. Rowling meets Georgette Heyer,"" and that's a very apt description. The Magician's Ward is just as much a Regency romance as it is a Regency-set fantasy-mystery."
5,So when's the third coming out?,"""Magician's Ward"" is a truly excellent book, even better than the already-wonderful ""Mairelon the Magician."" The plot is just as good and easier to understand, and we receive further insight into the characters. Ms. Wrede's period detail is impeccable. This is currently my favorite book (subject to change without notice). One word of advice: when reading this or ""Mairelon the Magician,"" have a dictionary next to you, just in case."
1,Blah nothing new,"Anther trite and stereotypical fantasy book. You're usual bag of tricks and fights, nothing new, nothing fresh, nothing that sparks the mind, this is one story that was easily forgotten and indistinguishable from other typical fantasies I've read. Read the first one, it's more than this one."
2,Not Worth Time- paticia Wrede fanatic,"magician's Ward failed to draw me in as a greedy and whistful reader, unlike the previous books by this well known fantasy author. Hey, maybe I just prefer reading about her Dragon Series, but magician's Ward had a dull and nontheless boring female as a leader, who is undeservingly given the main lead."
3,"Not great, not bad, but worth a few hours of your time","I haven't read the first, being unable to get a hold of one (the publisher is out of stock), but I'd like to, from this one. The story is a bit slight, but the character of Kim is engaging and you find yourself sympathizing with her efforts to become a magician and not just another English lady. I found the idea of the High Society of England being composed of magicians to be an intriguing one, and one that possibly deserved more development than it got. Then again, perhaps it did in the first book. I also think this series, if continued, could do with a bit more emphasis on the magic itself. How does it work, what kind of spells are there, etc. It was a relief, although somewhat predictable, that Kim and Mairelon got together at the end. Not the greatest I've ever read, but certainly entertaining and worth a few hours of my time."
5,definately worth the time,"I have loved all of Patricia Wrede's books that I have read, and this one is no different. It has the same odd style of humor in all her books, and is a delightful new twist to the London ton. I hope that there will be more in this series."
4,Great Book,"I loved this book, I especially liked seeing the other side of Kim, it shows Ms. Wredes talent for really understanding what readers want to see."
4,"J. K. Rowling meets Georgette Heyer, The Sequel","An enjoyable followup to MAIRELON THE MAGICIAN. Once again Ms. Wrede writes a Harry Potterish story, except the wizard-in-training in this case is female (Kim). This makes a regency romance setting possible in which many of the scenes will remind the reader of a Georgette Heyer novel. The two books can be read together in MAGIC & MALICE."
5,"Excellent label, great adhesive, price for quantity hard to beat","I've purchased other postage tapes/labels before and while most perform just fine they tend to be more expensive. These labels are excellent, offering four labels per sheet. The adhesive performs just as well as any other I've purchased and I've never had an issue with the Post Office. I prefer this pinwheel type over the standard type that includes just two labels per sheet. You can process these much quicker if you are printing multiples of the same label. Plus, these are a bit shorter and easier to fit on small packages as compared the the standard type. Excellent quality and you cannot beat the quantity you get for the price."
5,Advice to live by,"I personally know the author, but believe me it hasn't colored my decision. Ms Waxler's sin-centric investment advice is invaluable to anyone who need big and speedy profits to get you through any rough patches. Every artist or freelancer should invest the $20something bucks to access their own little financial security net, cause not only is it an interesting read it really works. High risk living doesn't have to mean a risky bottom line! Sin to win!"
4,Simple and sweet,Yume Bitsu have made a beautiful and moody cd. Somewhere between mogwai and ride with a hint of guided by voices. Doctor trips is the stand out track which has everything from the sound of rain to toy telephones. Very sweet.
4,acoustic collection : 1999-2002,"only problem with this package, it contains three previously released cd's that i already have. if you do not have them it is an excellent buy."
4,Back to Her Roots,"Dolly Parton is a wonderful acoustic performer. Her Appalachian roots shine through in the Bluegrass selections in this set. I liked (with a few exceptions) the songs chosen, and the players were marvellous."
5,Dolly's acoustic collection,This is the absolute best of Dolly. She has been one of my favorite singers for years and this is my favorite of her work.
3,three out of four work,"There are four cds in this box. Three worked fine but the freebie didn't work at all. I returned it to you and you promptly replaced the whole set. Same problem--three out of the four work fine but the Acoustic Selection still won't run. Since I wanted the three, I just gave up on the fourth one. Outside of that I'm very satisfied."
1,YUCK... HORRIBLE!,"As far as this date is concerned, ""Good Bait"" should be renamed ""The Same Lick Over And Over Again""... thanks, Frank. Not only do these two play the head out of tune, but they make a mess of the blowin'. Freeman doesn't play avant-garde, he sounds to me like an old man who can't play anymore... fumbling around. Too bad they don't have a ZERO stars choice."
3,strictly for teenagers,"I found this movie rather juvenile. Firstly, it`s about a 16 year old girl in a sci-fi take off on Wizard of Oz.(Off to see the wizard in the land of New Eden complete with dog and companions in a series of quirky encounters.) The evil witch in this instance is a man who is a ""mind sucker"". It`s full of today`s jargon: have a nice day, big time and hanging out to state a few, although it takes place far into the future. There`s not a lot of suspense because you know they will find New Eden."
4,different,"I can promose that out of all of the SiFi movies you will ever see you will never see one like this with its originality geting the four stars. The acting is good, not the best that I'v seen but it is worthy. The set is intriguing, even though it changes frequently, from a dirty town over crowded with people, to a desert landscape, to a rain forest shore. The charicters are hard to believe sometimes, mainly a girl who can make fire spout from her fingers. But all in all this is a pretty good film."
2,Sound crappy and cheap,"Don't buy this since I sold mine rightaway. If you're a new buyer and stil want Digitech product, get the RP250 instead. A lot better sound. But if you want a better tone, get Zoom G2.1u, it's a steal."
5,Old Timers,Pure Burl. Young people aren't familar with this old guy but except for Frosty but he was a great talent and shouldn't be forgotten. Love the gospel songs.
5,Wayfaring stranger is just what the doctor ordered,The Wayfaring Stranger CD by Burl Ives is just what I ordered and it arrived quickly.
5,Dieting Can Be Fun,"This book is for anyone who is frustrated with being frustrated. The number of pounds isn't the issue. What does matter is that you are ready for an example of how to joyously release excess weight, for permission to be yourself, or a loving intelligent companion for the journey. ""Dieting Can Be Fun"" provides all three."
3,"Good, not great pillow","I was disapointed with this pillow, I have terrific headaches and neck pain. I was hoping this would help but it hasn't. The pillow isn't very ""moldable"" it's a little too high and firm for my needs. No bad smell like some other reviews. My husband loves it!!!"
4,Well worth the price,"I bought this pillow because I wasn't completely satisfied with another foam pillow that I bought, nor was my husband. This thing is great. My husband liked it so much that I ordered him one too. They hold their shape better. The only reason I didn't give these pillows 5 stars is because they aren't quite high enough for us but we just use the other foampillows we bought to raise them a bit and sleep better than before!"
4,Memory Pillow,I think the pillow is great. Its definitely more comfortable than a regular pillow and my neck crinks in the morning have become lesser.
4,Love the pillow; hate the smell,"This pillow is exactly what I was looking for in a memory foam pillow. It's supportive, regular pillow shaped, not too tall, etc. My only complaint was the horrible smell of the latex (or whatever it is) foam. I understand this is common with these pillows.So, I washed it in the bathtub with a small amount of mild detergent. It took nearly a week to completely dry (no wringing the foam!). However, once it was dry, No Smell! Thereafter I've been pleased with my pillow. I'll definitely purchase another one whenever this one reaches its end of life."
3,Try before you buy,"I would give these pillows a test run before buying them. When I first used them, my neck hurt in the morning, and they smell weird, but they still work."
2,For die hard Kinks fans,"As a long time Kinks fan, it pains me to not recommend one of their albums. Quite frankly, this one is for those who feel the need to have as much of the Kinks' music as possible. Don't get me wrong, there are some good songs on it, but overall not enough to recommend it. The only song you might recognize is the first track that was used in 2008 for a Converse commercial. That commercial inspired me to finally buy this CD to replace my vinyl version. If you are just discovering the Kinks, wait and get this one later - start with a different one (from the 60s or later 70s or early 80s). If you are well versed in the Kinks music and just want more, then by all means get this and enjoy."
5,Memory Lane,"This is a great album, especially if you saw the original stage show. Favorites are Ducks on the Wall and Just a Face in the Crowd"
3,Pleasantly surprised,My first introduction to the Kinks was hearing Lola and Apeman on AM radio as a kid. Now that I am a bit older and am making the most out of the opportunity to buy these reissues of the Kinks from the 70's. I love this stuff and am not sure which one of these Kinks 70's concept albums I like the best. I really like Schoolboys and the first Preservation album and this one a little less. It's not a masterpiece like Arthur or Something Else but it's a very solid album nonetheless and is fun to listen when I'm on a long road trip. The live version of Ordinary People is a hoot. Dave really lets loose with his guitar and vocals.
2,Digitizing my youthful record collection,"Buying CDs to replace my albums and so I got around to getting this one. Not sure why I bought it 30 years ago. I like the Kinks but this is sort of obscure. Anyway, it has a few good songs, but the rest is hard to get through. Starmaker is typical Kinks song and is pretty good. Ducks on the Wall and Rush Hour Blues are pretty funny. But that's it."
2,Something went wrong on my purchase,"I usually read some of the reviews before posting my own, just to see what everyone else is saying. I was surprised and disappointed to find that other viewers were submitting reviews on a 2 disk 4 hour set and I only had a 1 disk 2 hour set. I re-checked my disk and it was only 2 hours. Of course there is only 1 disk in the folder. I re-checked the advertised purchase price information and it listed 1 disk with a playing time of 4 hours.I feel I was short changed on this purchase. I am not recommending this one. Someone needs to look into this."
2,EVERY Pocky stick was broken into 2 or more pieces.,"I noticed the box was slighty damaged and then the Pocky was very damaged. I did not enjoy this product as much as everyone else but it was a nice treat. If your looking for a good Japanese candy I would suggest Botan Rice Candy. I would personally not buy this product again unless I found it for 0.99$ at a store, but good luck finding it! :/"
3,pocky was broken,after i had goten my pocky the box was crushed and my pocky was in peaces altho this is original japanese pocky soo... it is ok i gess
1,IT STILL HASNT COME!!!!,"I've waited over a month, and my Pocky still hasn't come!!!! But I found out that they sell Pocky at Walmart... -.- My dad started cracking up laughing"
1,Melted Mess,Couldn't eat it... arrived melted and moldy looking. Entire package contents destroyed... still waiting for money back. Highly suggest you pick this up at the grocery.
3,A little smaller than I expected...,"This candle snuffer looks OK on the mantle, and does the job, but the handle is a little shorter than I had hoped."
3,Battle of the Camps Review,"A decent cd. Has the classic hip hop feel to it. The cd starts out strong with the first 5 or 6 songs. A lot of notable christian rappers are on this cd, KJ-52, Todd Bangz, Elle Roc, Raiders of the Lost, etc..."
2,Dissappointing condition of product,There are no expiration dates on the bottles of yeast. I am assuming they have been setting a long time because the seals on the bottle are dried out and failing. The product arrived linking out of the bottles.
5,Awesome supplement for vegetarians,"Great protein and B12 supplement. Tastes great and can be used on salads, smoothies, popcorn and more."
2,Formating problems,"This negative review is for the Kindle version, which isn't formatted properly. I think the problem is likely due to the book having sidebars or something similar. I was reading about how a fetus develops in the womb. The text abruptly switched to facts about monkeys and chimps. Then it switched back to unborn babies. This continued to happen throughout the Kindle sample. It was annoying, so I opted not to buy the book when I reached the end of the sample.Perhaps if the book had been really fascinating I would have bought it anyway and put up with the formatting problem, but it was a little dry. There are other books available for Kindle that cover the same subjects well. I'd suggest Why You Shouldn't Eat Your Boogers, 10 Ways to Recycle a Corpse, or Why Do Men Have Nipples, instead of this book."
5,Great 2nd Book to Keep at Home!,"This used book was received in exactly the condition described on the website, and is a perfect duplicate book for my middle school child to keep at home so that the school's book does not have to be carried back and forth each day. The book is heavy, and this was an economical solution!"
1,Prentice Hall Mathematics,Book was in very poor condition and not as specified at the time of purchase.
1,This fence is junk,"This fence is a worthless piece of junk, and all the helpline people can do is send you new parts that are just as junky as the stuf that is broken. Oh - and replacement parts are only warrantied for 90 days, even if they break a week after the initial purchase.Just spend the extra money and get a fence from someone else."
1,Junk,"Product arrived on time. I also order the extra spool of wire. I had system professionally installed and that's where I ran into the first issue. The wire that comes with the system is far too flimsy for installing as it should be. I ended up buying a heavier gauge of wire. Less than a month after it was installed, the battery in the collar went dead (I woke up this morning and saw the ""low battery indicator light flashing"".) I wasn't worried because in anticipation of just such an occurence I had also purchase four packages of two batteries each - based on comments I'd read previous to buying this about battery life. Well, I installed all eight batteries and every one of them is giving low battery indicator. This product is junk. It is exactly what you get when you try to save money."
4,works well so far,So far this collar has worked as it is advertised. The only glitch is the wall unit beeps occasionally. Dog stays in yard now. He wandered a couple times on the #3 level so I turned it up to #4.
3,"misleading, covers UP to 25 acres (with aditional wire!!!!!!!)","Somehow the product description on Amazon leaves out the aditional wire needed. 500 ft of wire is barely enough to cover 1/3 of an acre. It's written on the box itself, but Amazon needs to adjust it's description. Maybe include the wire chart?"
1,Not for larger active dogs,"I have owned the PetSafe Deluxe system for about 6 months and it encircles a 1 acre lot. I keep it on ""stubborn dog"" settings with the maximum warning range and my 8mo old chocolate lab runs straight through it with a slight yelp as she crosses the line. She will then sit in the neighbors yard unwilling to cross back over until she gets excited again. The shock would barely phase the average house cat. She recently showed up with two broken legs and a missing $60 collar because she walked through the fence and apparently met an angry neighbor. In extreme cold and/or wet conditions, the collar will not function at all. I have insured that it is properly installed. If you have a large or stubborn breed of dog, do not buy this product."
2,Wire Breaks,"I have had to reconnect breaks in the loop six times. I followed the installations to a tee, yet every week the loop breaks and I have to find and repair the breaks in the wire. First break I dug the whole fence up to finally find and repair the break. It took about 4 hours to find, repair, and re-bury the fence. On the second break I went out and bought a Wire Break Locater Kit for $50, which worked pretty well. Since then I have had four more breaks I have had to repair. There is quite a bit of maintenance involved in this fence.So overall the fence works well when it is working but I would highly recommend the Wire Break Locater. Also you need to be willing to repair the fence frequently."
1,Caveat Emptor,"It is surprising that this pamphlet is still offered for sale. As I pointed out in my review, the content does not match the title, the footnotes lack enough detail to be useful, the scholarship is flawed and the printing is poor."
1,junk,Will not fully open to form a straight line rule. Not usable. Does not work for what it is meant. Maybe OK as a display piece.
4,death of some salesmen,"I think all the episodes in this collection are good. However, I would really appreciate it if someone could tell me who the girl at the start of death of some salesmen is. Please and thank you."
4,1 IS THE BEST,"THE FIRST EPISODE, WITH TIM CURRY IN THREE DIFFERENT SLACK JAWED YOKAL, HICK PARTS IS THE ONE TO SEE. TIM CURRY GIVES A GREAT PERFORMANCE. THE SECOND ONE IS IDIODIC, AND VERY LOWSY. THE THIRD IS PREETY GOOD, BUT TOO SEX BASED. END"
4,james taylor,"although the first few chapters about family history are lengthy and tough: this is thé reference book about james taylor; family facts are the red threads throughout the book; many detailed facts; unfortunately still not enough interviews with james himself, but that probably always will be a problem;"
2,Better said in half the pages,"Could have saved a lot of trees. The family tree, going back to the 1700's had two pages of interest. Every time the author wrote a personal, intimate insite he regressed by writing two chapters of name dropping history.Total disappointment and a huge yawn."
4,Interesting read on a music icon.,"Yes the book begins with a lot on family history. I found it difficult to get into at first, but the more I read into the history of James Taylor's ancestors, I was beginning to see why this was so important, as James comes from a long line of great men. I did find that the written expression was a little wishy washy to begin with, but it's not too difficult to decipher, so don't let that put you off. I recently wrote a university assignment on the depths of creativity within music and thought James was a prime example. I referenced this book a few times as I found it useful in my study. But this being said, I did find it a very interesting read on a great music icon and would recommend anyone who follows James Taylor's music to get a hold of this book. I do wish there was more on his personal life, but I don't think this was White's intention."
3,77 pages and I'm still not interested,"Although this book is rich in detail, I think I should have heeded the warnings about it being slow going in the beginning. At 77 pages, I have yet to read much about James Taylor, but I have read a lot about his family tree and his father's ""escape"" to Antarctica. I have discovered, at least for me, being an avid reader, that life is too short to spend on books that can't hold my interest. If I've made it to page 77 and I'm still not interested it's time to quit. I think I probably read the ""long ago and far away"" part, but never reached ""James Taylor, His Life and Music."" Unfortunately, I don't seem to care now."
2,Excruciatingly poorly written,"Wow, I've been trying to wade through this book for about a week now. The author constantly trails off into way-too-long tangents on history, other celebrities, and other artists' work. He also glosses over or barely delves into many of the key points in Taylor's life (marriages/divorces, deaths of family members, addictions). I think he could have used some Ritalin to help him concentrate on the subject at hand: ""Remember to write about James Taylor, remember to write about James Taylor. . ."""
2,Boring,"Very tedious boring start about family history in British Isles.Never really picked up the pace, almost nothing new. Glosses overheroin and drug abuse. Sorry, poorly done"
5,Getting clear on the essence of your brand,"Excellent. LIstened several times, did the workbook. Explains clearly what underlies the superficial aspects of your brand (logo, image, etc.). Takes you through the step-by-step process of what makes you special and unique. Essential for any person or business selling services or products that are intangible or complex. Do you have a hard time explaining what it is that you actually do ... in a few seconds? This will enable to do that with clarity and elegance. Highly recommended."
4,A book worth every penny,"Of course it's not perfect, but its cheap! I just wish I could have read this before I spent 100's on other Windows NT doorstops.This volume from Sybex covers most of what any beginner would need to know to understand the rudiments of NT and answers a lot of useful questions for those beyond beginer grade.I would have prefered more focus on NT4 workstation, and I fail to understand the extensive coverage of IE4 which was buggy and short lived. But I learned enough about NT, networking and troubleshooting to make the spend worthwhile. A very good introductory text which surpasses by far the usual 'idiot style beginners books' to be more of an in-depth text without overkill.Highly readable and recommended."
1,Awful button and very dim,"This light is not only inexpensive, but very cheaply made. The switch is awful, and difficult to turn on and off. The light is very dim, even in complete darkness. I was hoping that being an LED flashlight that it would actually be fairly bright. It is not. I would not purchase this light again if given a choice. It breaks down to the fact that you get what you pay for. If it had a button to press on and off and the light was much brighter, it would be much better. I wish i could give it zero stars. The only good thing about it is that it easily clips to bags."
4,Nice little light for the price,"I bought this to clip on my telescope base, as a red light it does not hurt my night vision as much as a white light. It works well for it's intended purpose.The main reasons I bought this are the clip and the red light.If you are looking for a white light to carry on your keychain try the Streamlight Nano"
4,Good sword,"This is overall a good sword. It came very fast, three days if I remember correctly. Its very very dull, and getting it in and out of its saya is a little difficult, but its a good buy if you dont plan on ever using it."
2,Difficult to use for small objects,"We bought this grinder for the vacuum dust bag attachment, but we never really got to try that. The grinding wheels were too hard to use with small objects....the guards simply got in the way. We ended up returning this grinder"
3,"Nice, but Could Use Information","The cards are beautiful and fun, only 3 stars because they could have fit a lot more info on them."
3,good cartoon version,"This vhs video is a good cartoon version of the favored children's book: ""Bunnicula"". The story veers off from the book, but it's good, nonetheless."
2,"Cute, but not worth my time","On its own, this was a cute, classically animated cartoon. It reminded me of Scooby Doo. However, as a teacher, I found it really upsetting that it wasn't true to the book. James and Deborah Howe did such a wonderful job with characterization, language, etc., that was lost in the video version. The plot was oversimplified in parts, and completely inaccurate in others. I was quite disappointed."
2,"Not bad-bad, but disappointing","""Tokyo dance-hall music"" is what it says on the back cover. At first I thought it might be classic, old-style Japanese pop. Turns out it's a bunch of cover songs, performed by two women (apparently twins, if the cover is any indicuation) and backed by a decent but not particularly original backup band. The vocals are of the standard ""awww look how cute the Japanese women sing!"" variety, which is to say, they are momentarily amusing, and then annoying. A comparison to karaoke isn't far off. That said, there's nothing horrible about any of this -- everybody involved is competent, the production value is strong, and the vocalists hit their notes, etc. If this were on in the background of a store or something, it'd make things nice and upbeat."
3,"smooth start, rough finish","Although the suicides, molestations, and nude adolescent romps at a camp lead by an adult choral director could be seen as extreme, the primary characters keep these devices in check by being well constructed, engaging, and firmly in control during the first part of the novel. Unfortunately, this is reversed in the last quarter. Here an increasingly bizarre and unrealistic plot is forced on the protagonists, who begin to behave in ways that appear contrived and false. Instead of raising my pulse, the jacked up action caused my interest in Fee and Warden to flag. At this point the writing also seemed to become less focused and more opaque. Some passages were almost incomprehensible to me--I suspected proof-reading deficiencies.Finally, instead of confronting the ""fox"" and forcing Warden and Fee, in the end, to deal head on with themselves and their relationship, the author chooses abandonment. And, as a reader, that's the way I felt too, abandoned."
5,"Enthralling, mysterious, unforgetable","I was wary of the subject matter, but a friend's recommendation got me to read this book. The three page prologue was so captivating that I immediately read it again, out loud. This a writer of astonishing depth and command. One example: Fee, the protagonist is numbed by his experience of molestation, but that allows him to report all the following events from that remove. Terrible events transpire, but the reader wants to stay with Fee because he is incapable of over-dramatizing. This subtlety allows the reader a depth of understanding. I had no idea where the novel would go next. Every time it moved toward the traditional telling of this story, it would veer in another direction. Brilliant. Surprising. Deeply affecting."
4,Replacement Filters,"I bought these replacement filters through Amazon, however they were supplied by an unknown source to me and I have no regrets. Also they were priced better than I could find at my local stores. These aftermarket filters are doing exactly what the originals did and that's plenty good enough for me!"
4,not storybook illustration version?,"I'm surprised no one mentioned that the Corduroy story is the only one that is not a cartoon. I thought it was very well cast and well presented with real actors in a real department store, but would have preferred the story cartoon version. The story was also changed a bit, thought the plot stayed the same. Otherwise all the other stories are excellent. As a teacher, I love that these storybooks were made into videos!"
3,"Live-Action Corduroy, NOT Animated","If you are looking for an illustrated/animated version of Corduroy, this is not it.I bought this DVD because my toddler loves all things Corduroy. We already had the Scholastic Storybook Treasures DVD of A Pocket For Corduroy, which she could watch all day if I let her, and I thought this would be a good alternative. But my daughter won't watch it because a) it is live-action and b) it does not follow the original story. The premise is the same and as an adult I can tell that it is basically the same story. But to my daughter, the giant bear who looks vaguely like Corduroy and crawls through a train tunnel is not actually Corduroy."
4,Very large,"This was an awesome piece, but was to large. I ended up returning it in trade for the 12"" one which is great."
5,Highly Recommended!,"In the interests of safety, we'll refrain from quoting this fine book by Deborah E. Bouchoux, a specialist in intellectual property who teamed with AMACOM to create that rarest of volumes: a straightforward book about law that is simple to read (it's a formula she should patent). This comprehensive volume covers the nuts and bolts of U.S. patent and trademark law. It also gives advice on how to protect your intellectual property and avoid infringement, and reports on the latest patent trends in high tech. Of most concern for general business managers, Bouchoux reviews how (and why) to conduct intellectual property audits within your organization. With intellectual property emerging as the new corporate treasure of the knowledge economy, we [...] suggest that research and development managers and executives of every stripe study this volume carefully. Why should your attorney be the only one who understands what you really own?"
1,Save the money,I found this book very obtuse and thought the author tried to make this subject much more difficult than it really is. Save your money.
4,Nice psychedelic vibe mixed within sinister electro-industrial,"After having purchased and listened to Velvet Acid Christ's 'Between the Eyes Volume 1,2,3,4' (a collection of odds 'n ends from 1994-95) this was my first full VAC cd.I think 'Twisted Thought Generator' (TTG) is great HOWEVER the first 3 tracks seem more representative of the Between The Eyes volumes, not necessarily a part of this album's continuity...the first 3 tracks seem to be singular workouts rather than giving the listener a consistant, WHOLE connection with the TTG concept (whatever that might be).VAC uses samples and such as part of his unique sonic pallet. From track 4 thru 9 the samples hold the album together with a consistant tone of voice and mood (along with EVERYTHING else), giving the album a decent flow and taking the listener on a mind blowing trip."
5,Best VAC Disc Yet,"This is my favorite of the several VAC discs I've heard. It shows a much greater sophistication in overall production. I espically like how the samples are much more integrated and far less obtrusive than in previous efforts, where often it seemed as though the music was centered around them; this disc displays an excellent smoothness in their use. As always the dark vocals are well mixed in, although they are more understandable than I recall them being in previous albumns. The base music is varied, but has a pleasent and consistant trancey quality which I enjoy very much, especially in tracks such as Mindphlux (my favorite on this albumn) and Hypersphere. I was also amused by the bonus tracks, a complete copy of Dimension8 in mp3 format. Overall just a great disc."
5,Amazing,"This cd had such wonderful content, it fully compared with other past albums put out. The lyrics were well written, and completely intoxicating. I especially enjoyed Dilauded, in that it was such a difference in tunes between the molodius females, and harder male voices. Worth the money."
5,Wow!,"I have fairly discriminating tastes when it comes to my industrial/darkwave music. ""Twisted Thought Generator"" takes VAC in a different/darker direction than ""Fun With Knives"". From Erickson's own liner notes: ""As I progressed with the record, the songs became darker and darker...I feel this is our most Skinny Puppy influenced record ever."" True enough. This CD is (almost) as great as Skinny Puppy. I haven't checked out the extra hidden MP3 tracks yet, because the CD still hasn't left my player. If you liked dark electronic music, you'll probably love this CD."
2,"2 Stars, not enough ""good over bad"" for 3",Let me start by saying i like this cd. Now with that said let me rip it apart and put it back together. This is good listen to for all of 15 minutes then you have grown bored of the same tired overplayed and passé' rifts.The bass beats alone are enough to give it a 5+ (samples are equally as good however what's left puts me to tears. VAC is better than this cd lets on. i do recommend it but you'll probably not listen to it too terribly too much...
3,A bit different from previous Velvet Acid Christ releases,"Twisted Thought Generator deviates slightly from the traditional Velvet Acid Christ music formula. As Bryan Erickson notes in the CD book, this album has more of a slower and true industrial sound than his previous works. There are a couple of tracks on here that are fast paced, but even the ones that aren't are still fairly good in their own right. I gave Twisted Thought Generator a mediocre rating only because I'm more of a fan of the faster, dance floor oriented style of industrial/EBM. If you are a fan of Velvet Acid Christ, go ahead and get Twisted Thought Generator. If you are not familiar with Velvet Acid Christ, you may want to check out an older album such as Fun With Knives or Calling Of The Dead to get to know the sound."
3,Music to stomp angrily by,"Twisted Thought Generator is an interesting album. It was originally supposed to be a collection of dancey, upbeat songs about drugs, but somewhere along the way, Velvet Acid Christ's frontman Bryan Erickson fell into the depths of a classic depression. So, the music stayed dancey, but certainly did not remain upbeat. This is sombre stuff, despite the sometimes frenetic basslines.The Skinny Puppy influence is very strong, particularly in some of the lyrics. The music styles range from EBM to goa, but with the pervasive minor chords you would expect. Nary a guitar is to be heard on this album, and I like it that way. Of course, that will change with the next album...."
1,This cd sux,"This cd, Fun W/ Knives and Utopia/Dystopia all sound the same. Not original and all-together boring. Get Calling of the Dead and Church of Acid...now those are some good VAC cds! They have the perfect tone, samples, right amount of guitars, and atmosphere. those are the only two real VAC cds...you'll understand what I mean when you compare those two to all the rest. The proof is in the pudding."
1,whatever man....,".... that's about it. whooshing synthesizers, beats, some samples, slightly distorted vocals. kind of boring. the overly depressed theme reminds me of high school as in, 'bad poetry' and 'this is lame'.i didn't mind listening to it too much but i probably won't listen to it again. it's nothing special...i prefer merge or maybe vnv nation to this. as far as industrial goes i'll stick with revolting cocks, foetus, and skinny puppy."
4,Great surprise when you play it in your PC,"Velvet Acid Christ continues to put together songs that have multiple layers and a slightly different sound compared to all previous albums. The surprise comes when you put it into your PC and discover that there is an entire ""extra"" album on the CD in MP3 format with a readme file from Bryan himself telling you that the extra tracks are for his hardcore fans. All the extra tracks are extremely experimental in nature and created in a mind altered state and ""well"" worth listening too. Overall, I was very impressed with this entire album and look forward to the next offering."
5,great,"this cd is really really good. they lead lines are very diverse, the music is ever changing, its just bliss. Dilaudid sticks out as the best song in my opinion. . . i love the clash of beautiful females vocals with distorted madness.this is by far VACs best sounding cd in forms of sound quality. it's not as dancable as fun with knives, but that doesn't bother me at all, sometimes there's more to music than an annoying repetitive bass drum beat.cheers to a great cd!"
1,Dimwitted Course,"You will probably still be a dimwit after trying to use this ""course"". The very first tape had part of tape 5 in the middle and then went back to tape one; there are numerous errors in the booklet, i.e., words missing and pagination wrong; and, the teaching style is insipid and useless. Don't be a dimwit by buying this course."
2,Dimwits Beware!,"Starting with the alphabet, first they tell you to pronounce e with the ""eh"" sound, then they say ""ee"". In the middle of following along with the text on page 2, tape one, side one, it vanishes, only to reimerge on page 21 -22 which is titled tape five! Words are pronounced that are not in the text as well as type-o's. THIS IS JUST THE FIRST TAPE! If you're a dimwit like me, this IS NOT for you. Look elsewere."
2,bulb Not replaceable,"This is a nice lamp, while it lasts. Once the nightlight on the inside burns out, you can not replace the bulb, so it will no longer lights up the bottom. We used the nightlight for almost 2 years before it burnt out. Now we can only use the lamp feature."
5,Positive,"I am very happy with my purchase. It was a gift for a mother-to-be,and she was very excited about receiving the lamp. Also very fast delivery.Thank you,Patty Kosar"
2,get what you pay for,"The paper-made shade was crushed, although came in the box. I tried to straighten it out, but it resulted ugly white bent marks all over the place. Both base and the shade are not bright and not all that fun. On the picture the lamp looked somewhat lavender, however, it's blue. The base and the shade don't exactly match (different types of blue). characters are bleak and tiny. Honestly, I didn't expect a whole lot for $20, but this is pushing it. The reason I got it because I thought it would go with the lavender color of nursery. Imagine my disappointment... Overall, it is a very cheap-looking item."
1,I hate it!,It won't play in either of my U.S.A. players; it's foreign. How would like it? I sent it back at my own expense.AGP
5,Wonderful! Fabulous!,"Thank you, Ms. Koshiyama.This is a wonderful Journal. It has become my family's Journal, from Josh's first words to passing our MCSE certification exams. I like to look back at what birthday gifts we gave friends and relatives from year to year so as not to repeat the same gift or idea.A software version would be wonderful, too - because this would allow key-word searches.Thank you for a wonderful idea!Elisia@Delphi.com"
4,ENTERTAINING,"I LIKED THIS BOOK ABOUT SCANDALS CONCERNING HOLLYWOOD STARS. THE AUTHOR COVERS FROM WOODY ALLEN, ROBERT MITCHUM, JUDY GARLAND AND MANY MORE. THE SCANDALS ARE COVERED IN DETAIL, SHORT AND TO THE POINT. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND PLAN ON READING OTHERS BY THIS AUTHOR. RECOMMENDED FOR ALL CURIOUS AND GOSSIP FANS."
2,Most Of The Book Nothing New,"I have read many books on Hollywood scandals, and other than some newer gossip, it's just the same old stuff, rehashed. Arbuckle, Harlow, etc etc. Heard it before. Author adds chapter on alleged witch hunts of the 50s, perhaps he should read about the real attemped Communist infiltration of Hollywood before crying about, say, Edward G Robinson. Compares ""censorship"" to Sean Penn and Dixie Chicks. Excuse me, but if there WERE government censorship, these overpaid actors and singers would not have been allowed to voice an opinion. If we as the public don't wish to buy their products, it is not censorship, but freedom of choice.Author simply got the idea from Kenneth Anger (whose books are inconsistent and full of unfounded gossip) and thought he'd do an updated version.If you're 30 or older and have read about old scandals, you won't find anything new here."
4,Fun To Read,If you love celebrity gossip and the dark side of Hollywood you will definitely want to get this book. It covers all the infamous Hollywood scandals including the suicide of Jean Harlow's husband and the murder of Lana Turner's gangster boyfriend. Some of the stories seem to be based more on rumors than on facts but it's still a lot of fun to read!
3,"he Hollywood Book of Scandals:The Shocking, Often Disgraceful Deeds and Affairs of Over 100 American Movie and TV Idols",Nothing particularly new or earth shaking. A good primer if you are new or care. I had hopes of discovering somthing new!
2,Even books get remade,"""The Hollywood Book of Scandals : The Shocking, Often Disgraceful Deeds and Affairs of Over 100 American Movie and TV Idols"" goes over some of the more famous brain farts of the Hollywood elite. Unfortunately, most, if not all of the material here has been gone over again and again, both in print and on the large and small screens. Ultimately, the book comes across as a slighty more coherent, somewhat less sleazy version of Kenneth Anger's ""Hollywood Babylon"" books (the cover even bears a certain resemblence to Anger's first volume). Some readers may be uncomfortable with Parish's seeming fixation on the sexual orientations of most of his subjects. All told, this book is best recommended to those with little previous knowledge of Hollywood's less pleasant side. For the rest, it's the ""same old-same old"" (as my grandmother would say)."
2,The Hollywood Book of Scandals,The scandals themselves were interesting however I found the book hard to read. Some of the information was repetitive from chapter to chapter and it was not well written. I was looking for something that I could just pick up an read a story at a time and this was not the book for that.
4,A good grounding on Hollywood scandal,"Let's face it - Hollywood will never be short of a good scandal, or seventeen. If you're a deep reader of Hollywood history and lore, then you'll probably know about most of the scandals covered here. But if you're new to it all and are keen to know more about what happens to these people when the cameras stop turning, then this is a pretty good place to start. Well written and researched and covers the biggies."
4,Surprise: Board Book Not the Full Version!?,"My son loved the ""Ten Apples Up On Top"" (Hardcover) book I borrowed for him from the library so much that I ordered a copy of our own. Thinking that the board book would be more sturdy, that's what I ordered. Never imagined that the board book could be only less than half of the full version, you can imagine the surprise and disappointement we had when we sat down to read it together. Now I know to compare the number of pages when I order. I wish there were some kind of clearer indication and warning about Board book version not being the full version somewhere in the Product Description."
4,Fun for kids. Tedious for adults,"Review by Sherry North, Author, Because You Are My BabyTen Apples Up on Top is a good introduction to counting and addition for preschoolers. My 3-year-old loves it. He counts the apples on every page and never gets bored. Me, on the other hand - I would have liked the book to have more of a storyline."
5,Ten Apples Up on Top,This book was in GREAT condition! It arrived quickly and I am very happy with my order.
4,Entertaining....with an anticlimax!,"How many apples can you place on top of your head...one, two, three? This book is really fun. As a child I remember counting the apples ""up on top"" of the characters heads. With each turn of the page a new and more outrageous event takes place as well as the addition of more ""apples up on top"". My girls listen attentively through the entire book and love the conclusion each time we read it."
4,An addictive classic,"My daughter wanted this book read to her several times a day, every day, for months when she was two. It is wonderful, predictable text and teaches counting and rhyming. Dr. Seuss didn't put his name on it originally because it wasn't up to his standards, but it's still a great little kid book!"
3,Black Vinegar,"This vinegar is very hard to find in stores, and I was to quite a few. It gave a completely different taste to the HOt and Sour soup that I was preparing. I have other receipes that call for black vinegar and I have done some experimenting with it. It has a very strong and unusual flavor. Very good."
3,Short in entertainment value,"My cats may not all be the smartest, one is pretty, one is funny, and one is huge (28 pounds). But they were all equally bored by this toy. The pretty one bounced the teeter totter a couple of times and walked away. The funny one looked at the marble in the teeter totter, and the huge one yanked off the feathers before he walked away.Cat toys are not likely to last long. And the engineering of this device is really outstanding. It is a very complicated which is usually good for kitties. Too complicated?"
3,misleading colors and capacity,"Don't believe the colors in the photos of this brand's teapots! I bought the ""royal blue"" and it's cobalt, a true cobalt. I also bought the ""yellow"" one and it's mustard rather than yellow.The capacity is listed at 16 ounces and the teapot really does hold 16 ounces of water, but it won't hold even a teabag more than that - best to consider it a 12 ounce teapot which is enough for one mug."
1,So much for matching to my vehicle,"My first purchase at Amazon. Selected my vehicle through the website ('02 GMC Envoy XL 4WD)and got the PN RS5124. Ordered it, got it pretty quick. Went to put it on and the upper end had the older two-hole bolt bracket at top instead of just an eye hole the old shock has and the bolts are looser even if I remove that bracket. Went to the Rancho site and they don't even list Envoys in their selection criteria. Now my vehicle is up on jacks and I have to try and stop at a local auto supply and see what I can dig up. No help from the Amazon website other than being forced to return it."
2,Too Slow,"This book could have been very good, however, the book started out and remain too slow. In my opinon, there wasn't any chemistry between the two main characters."
2,Boring!!,I couldn't finish this book. It started off slow and continued to slow down. Where was the spice? The sassiness? The chemistry?
4,"Good, solid short fiction",Dana Johnson has great characterization and style. The work is entertaining (surprisingly erotic at times) and a good way to kill an hour or two. Throughly enjoyable stuff.
3,Not for children,"Unfortunately, I did not adequately research which book to choose for my Adolescent Literature class, and I chose ""Break Any Woman Down"" as my ""Adult Best-Seller"" that could be used in a high-school English class. This book is definitely not for children, not mine, at least.The first story was beautiful, bringing me into the story of the young black girl in white suburbia. This story would be great for my class, especially since my school is predominately white, with a small percentage of black students. Past that, however, the subject matter was too adult. There is one story about a stripper and a pornographic film star that addresses the issue of jealousy very well; it would not be appropriate for minors.I loved the book and was impressed by the variety of characters (many different ethnicities) and issues. It was a quick read and I would recommend it to my adult colleagues."
2,Not that useful.,"This book was clearly more useful when it first came out. Most of the statistics are outdated and the book spends most of its time repeating itself. Once you get passed the first few articles, you've pretty much read the entire book. We dropped the textbook two weeks in to class realizing the flaws I pointed out. There are much better texts for sociology out there."
3,by itself is beautiful but...,"next to the kitchen faucet, it screams for attention. Maybe for a wet bar by itself but not next to the main kitchen faucet."
5,Nice Quality,This is a nice quality item that fit very well in our kitchen. The brushed fininsh is exactly what we wanted. We like it.
4,Really good,"Way above the quality you get with the stock faucet in an RO system. Smooth operation, good fit and finish, and overall very SOLID feel. Excellent."
4,Filtered water faucet,Very good looking and it works very smoothly. We can highly recommend this unit. Not expensive considering other competitive products.
5,Grammar with a funny bone,"Almost nothing is as boring as learning the rules of grammar.The Elephants of Style, however, makes the subject humorous and easier to both read and learn about. The author uses great(and often funny ) examples to teach students about everything from parts of speech to plagarism. I would recommend this book to college freshman, English teachers, or anyone struggling with grammar.Of course, grammar may never lose the title of ""boringest of them all,"" but at least there is a little humor at the end of the tunnel."
2,Pretty but a letdown after Rayman 2,The graphis are great. The gameplay is smooth. This game is not really much of a challenge. While Rayan 2 had me on the edge of my seat this turkey was way too easy to negotiate. Hopefully if there is a Rayman 4 it will be worth the money.
1,Cherish your memories of Rayman 2.,"I bought Rayman 3 sight unseen, since Rayman 2 was one of my favorite games. The graphics are there, and the gameplay is mostly there, but the attitude has been kicked up to 11, and it's not all that charming.I'm not sure what else to say; the differences in tone were pretty apparent by the end of the introduction, and by the time I quit in disgust -- in the middle of a ""bonus game"" I couldn't get out of -- it was pretty clear that, unlike Rayman 2 which had me completely hooked by the end of the demo, this was a game I shouldn't have wasted my money on..."
2,Not up to par with rayman 2,"My kids love Rayman 2 so much that I've played it through (beginning to end) with them about 6 times, doing a some of the levels about 20 times.I was bored with that, so I decided to pick up rayman 3. Big mistake! They hate it so much they wouldn't play after the first hour, and I got bored with it in about the same amount of time. I pushed forward just to see if it got better, but it really didn't."
2,The potential is there...,"I own this game and I have to say, it SUCKS. I have not played the other Rayman games, but as a teen gamer, this is the worst action game I own. Don't bother getting it unless you're willing to spend your money for a total of 45 minutes of enjoyment. The reason why I say these things are: it's repetitive, in some places too easy or too hard, and very frustrating. The only good things are the graphics, characters, and NOT the plot. Bottom line- don't even waste your time looking at this game."
4,Rayman is back but.....,Ive played only a couple other rayman games and there pretty good. ive never played this one so thats y im givin it a 4. ill prbabli get it
2,Low quality,This turned out to be a low quality poster. I can see a lot of grain on this photo and will not put it up on the wall. Shipping charges are high.
4,The Man Who Saved Christmas,"This is an interesting story that we enjoyed watching. Not all the acting is top notch at times, but the story is a positive one with a good moral."
3,Christmas DVD,"A friend asked me to find this item for a Christmas Presents. She had looked for it in stores Locally, and not found. She was grateful that Amazon.con had it. Her brother enjoyed the gift.I am not able to rate the item well. Only cause I myself did not see movie."
5,The Man Who Saved Christmas,"What an engrossing film! I think what really did it for me was that fact that it was based on a true story. It demonstrated not only the hard work that goes into creating a business, but it demonstrated how the factory system could be progressive by the era standards. Mr. Gilbert did not put profit first, he believed in people first. In this day and age it is point that sometimes seems to be lost. I would recommend this to anyone, who wants a story without the usual plotted ending."
5,Great movie fun to watch,The whole family enjoyed this so much I gave one to a family for a Christmas gift.
4,The Man Who Saved Christmas,I worried that this movie might be a little boring but purchased it anyway because I enjoy watching Jason Alexander and Ed Asner. I loved the small-town scenes and old-time romance between Jason's character and his wife. These days it is hard to find a movie where a husband and wife support each other in spite of adversity and naysayers. I love the fact that this is based on a real person. It is heartwarming and will make you want to hug all your family. This movie is suitable for all ages.
5,Holiday movie for the whole year,"This movie is one that could be viewed anytime of the year. While the ending focuses on saving the Christmas that was almost cancelled, the rest of the movie is the story of a man who was a child at heart. Through his understanding of children and what they love, he created toys that revolutionized the industry, and brought children along into the mechanical and technological age that swept this country at the climax of WWI. I was fascinated to watch the evolution of toys that I remember as a child. My grandchildren will love this film, and maybe realize that I didn't really play with dinosaurs when I was little....we had toys then too!"
4,The Man Who Saved Christmas DVD,"A new and enjoyable Christmas story, which is probably under appreciated by most. Jason Alexander does a teriffic acting job and if better publicized could be a yearly classic."
1,Jokebox Recorder,"This is a piece of junk. I got it to record my band sessions. I leave it charging all week, and actually plug it in during our sessions, and it only works half the time. Right now I have it plugged in, and I can't get it to turn on. It might just be my unit, but this thing is pretty worthless. I looked on the Archos site, and I don't think there's much I can do about it.Even if it is just my defective unit, the interface is pretty clunky. I can't imagine trying to navigate 15 G's and find a specific song. You'd be there all day. However, if it just worked it would be perfect for what I want to do."
3,Basketball Door Slammers,"According to my 9-yr old son, it is not all it is shown to be on television. All you do is hang it over the door, continually throw the ball at it, it makes comments, and racks up points. It is basically a one person game. You are competing against yourself. It is ""boring""."
4,The kids love it.,"I was concerned when the package arrived, as there was a four inch tear in the box along with an empty round hole, suggesting to me that something else might have been supposed to be included. So I put the item together, and it didn't work. It turns out that, when the batteries were replaced, it is one of my grandson's favorite toys this season. I am sure he would give it a five star rating."
2,Too Bad Gerber,"I was so upset about this tool I can hardly do a proper review. I have now had this a few months after having my last Gerber for eight years. The old tool was fantastic but things have changed at Gerber. They still offer the lifetime warranty but do not honor it. The quality of the tools now that there ""MADE IN CHINA"" is a joke. This new tool is so quality control flawed it is pathatic. I never was a Leatherman fan because I loved the one-handed slide of the Gerber. Now it is a one-hand slide with a small pull from the other hand. Now it is the look for another tool so you can pry the tools out of the handle of the Gerber(One Side Only). Other handles tools are so loose that they are useless. Well, just another American company that tried to save a nickel and then wondered why they went bankrupt."
3,black things broke,"Worked great and seemed to be built well. The black locking sliders broke off of mine within 6 months of VERY light use. I didnt try and get them fixed because I really didnt care enough to deal with shipping. I would get something that doesn't use this type of latching mechanism. The rest of the tool was good, and I have always heard good things about gerber."
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed with this purchase so I returned it for the New Leatherman Wave. It was very ""loose"" feeling, some corrosion and I just opened the box.I like my leatherman Wave and I am glad was able to exchange this with no problems at all."
5,best tool i own,i use this tool more then anything in my tool arsinal will purchase more as needed even gave a friend one of mine
5,Another Excellent Gerber,"The Diesel Needlenose is only a little bigger than one of my favorite multi-tools of all time, the Gerber 400/Sport model, which is hard to beat for compactness without sacrificing utility.The Diesel doesn't waste its extra size on more of the same and is definitely a great competitor to the vernable 400/Sport.Like all good Gerber products, it can be opened one handed, and has all the basic tools you need for work, camping, or in many other situations. When I first started my career, a friend gave me a Gerber and said, ""Wear it for a week."" Now I feel like I lost my keys when I'm without it."
1,adobe photoshop cs3 extended,This product had a virus it was not adobe photoshop cs3 extended. This seller sent out more virus cd than the real ones. DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!
1,Photoshop CS3 Ext,Delivery was VERY fast and product was as described in the original sealed box. Would but again from seller !!
2,"Buyer beware when it comes to ""[old versions]"" of Photoshop","I bought Photoshop CS3 Extended from seller ""Ameliaa21"" who, just like every other software vendor, claims that they do not sell pirated software. However, as stated on Adobe's website:""If the software has already been registered and the license holder cannot provide you with a transfer of ownership, the transfer is illegal, and you will not be able to legally use or register the software""[...]Because seller ""Ameliaa21"" failed to provide a transfer of License, Adobe considered this sale illegal. The software works and updated as normal but I have never been able to successfully register this product with Adobe. The ability to upgrade this version to CS4 or any other version in the future will be not possible. According to Adobe, the version that I bought from seller ""Ameliaa21"" had already been properly registered and upgraded to Photoshop CS4."
4,Love It,"Aside from being very complicated at first, I as an Artist, and Photographer find this software very helpful in both professions. I also think that the software is overpriced.I have composed my paintings, and restored old photographs. There are other software offerings available, but so far I am a fan of Photoshop."
3,CD only Photoshop CS3 Extended,"While I was suspicious of a $1000+ program selling for $225, I figured this was Amazon; it should be safe. Well, it was a mixed bag. All that came was a CD in a paper sleeve and 1 page of hard to follow instructions. The serial number was almost impossible to find. It was certainly NOT on the ""back of the CD case"" as the program said. This being said, however, the program works fine and I guess that's the most important thing. The convoluted activation process the software took me through does lead me to question the authentcity of this copy."
4,Locklin's picaresque,"Locklin's novel, ""Down and Out,"" is a picaresque romp through the seventies. Settings range from the academic world of Southern California to the pubs of London. The novel is delighfully bawdy (like Mr. Locklin's poetry), appealingly sexy and engagingly energetic. A must read."
4,"A skewed history of the Philippines, but a good action flick","By coincidence, I rented this the night before the World Trade Center bombings, and this pre-WWII action film definitely had an eerie feel later in the week, when I got around to watching it. Gary Cooper plays an Army doctor contending with Muslim fanatics in the Philippines -- including grim assassins who attacked the Army leaders in suicide missions that they believed would send them to heaven, with the blessing of Allah. Besides the creepy timeliness, this is also a gripping action film; raw, realistic and well-paced, this is a fascinating movie, even if its historical accuracy is somewhat questionable."
2,"An early, benevolent attempt at 'The Wild Bunch'.","A disaster movie masquerading as an imperialist jungle army adventure, as we sit through an hour and a half of character tomfoolery, sinister plots and love interests before the final spectacular set-piece, an old-fashioned dam-busting that spurts a Wagnerian birth-rush, waking up the cholera-ridden locals.It's easy enough to carp at the typical ideology - the well-rounded Americans; the infantilised Filipino locals; the sinister Fu Manchu villains. More interesting are the cracks - the violent vengefulness that grips David Niven's previously amiable character; the shocking murder of the commander in front of his wife and impotent peers; the blind intransigence of Captain Hartley."
4,Along the Khyber Pass,"This book has the seeds of something exceptional to come in the future. But bring a history of Pakistan before you read it. The stories are beautifully told, the black humor sounds like an American influence. It all weaves back and forth, needs some serious organizing. The author feels very strongly about his family and his country, and I appreciate that. And I hope to hear from him again before long."
5,"Tragic & hilarious, at the same time. Couldn't put it down!","This author does not waste words. Written with an infectious enthusiasm, it's just as well that the book was large in substance not size, because I had to read it cover to cover, in one sitting. The characters are vibrant and alive, some of their escapades left me rolling with laughter. Some incidents are poignantly tragic, making it a skillfully woven and balanced compilation.The backdrop is a tumultous time in India's history but fortunately, this book is not a history lesson. At a swift pace we are transferred from camel plodding, horse chargeing days to the present and some familiar figures are dealt with rather irreverently. I strongly recommend Topi . However, even though the content was great, I would have to deduct a point for the skimpy spiral bound cover. At the end of the book, I almost wished my plane was flying to Topi, Pakistan!"
1,Don't waste your time and money,Poor plot. Author should have written some short stories for periodicals before writing a book.Authors should stop jacking up rating of stars by writing reviews themselves....Please stop this practice
2,where is the culture,"what i enjoy tremendously about the sister fidelma series is the exploration of the people and culture of ireland. this entry in the series falls woefully short. yes, i know it is set in wales, but all the cultural/societal interactions are missing. this was a mystery set in a 2 dimensional world. i expect better from sister fidelma."
2,"Interesting story, clumsy writer","Peter Tremayne is the worst writer I read and Smoke in the Wind is as dreadfully bad as any of his books. I read his books because the advanced social structure of 7th century Ireland is so compelling, but at the end of each book I swear I will never read another one. He has absolutely no talent as a writer beyond some intriguing plots. He writes at about the level of Young Adult fiction, but at the very low end of that category. Some of his sentences are so clumsy they should be entered into a bad writing contest. He telegraphs almost every plot development and his dialogue is as stiff and unnatural as any I have ever read. If he has developed a strong following, as is indicated by some notes in the preface of ""Smoke in the Wind"", then I beg his publisher to find either a superb editor for Tremayne, or better yet, a ghostwriter."
3,Nice solid mystery.,"This is the 11th book in this ""mystery of ancient Ireland"" series featuring Sister Fidelma. As with the previous ones, it's full of interesting 7th century historical details, this time including Wales.There are two mysteries that overlap, though perhaps not the way you'd expect: everyone in a monastery has disappeared without a trace, along with the livestock and some of the valuables; and a young woman is murdered.Fidelma and Eadulf have been tasked by the Welsh king with solving the first mystery but have been given strict instructions by the local authority not to interfere in the second.While the historical details are fascinating, at times they get in the way of the story. There are also 4 characters whose names begin with the letter I, which tends to make things confusing--a pet peeve of mine. Still, the mystery is well thought out, and there are some good twists, as well as a little personal development in the protagonists' lives."
4,XP OK,"Negative first: XP OK is all it is. It's pretty buggy and crashes often. I tried natively, Windows 95 and Windows 98 compatibility mode, and neither of them made it completely stable.Aside from that, it's a pretty fun game. You get various weapons for a vehicle, run around, deliver parcels and blow things up. It's sort of an early Twisted Metal for PC. There's a simple campaign, as well. It gets pretty difficult towards the end.There's also a SimCity 2000 map/resource editor packaged with it. You can create cities with no limits, drive in them and blow them up. There's also a networked multiplayer mode that I haven't tried.The graphics are not for those not used to older games, however. They are terrible by today's standards, but that's expected. There are, however, some pretty good tunes included here.So, in the end, it's nowhere near a bad game, but it hasn't exactly aged gracefully."
2,A disappointment,I probably should have browsed other comments before clicking the buy button for this book. Technically I found this book to be banal and the witty style falls flat on its face. Disappointing and I almost certainly will be passing this book along to clear up shelf space.
5,Awesome Book,"Received book in a timely manner and it was in brand new condition when I received it, I love it! Thanks for speedy delivery and great condition, A+++!"
4,Great Machine but Beware...,"I bought this new and have had a tough time with it largely in part because I uploaded a back up software called ""Bounceback Express"" for my portable external storage hard drive. It is software that comes with most external hard drives made bu SEAGATE and SMARTDISK. DO NOT put this software into your mac it is like a virus and can scramble the keyboard and slow down the machine immensely.I sent my MacBook Pro back to apple twice and they gutted, but could not figure out the problem until recently. Great customer service through Apple and it is in no way their fault.Also, it is very important you make sure you get the new battery after the 2006 Sony recall. The warranty is great though for a year so they will replace it free if it is faulty.I would definately get the memory upgrade. All in all I would buy it again and I am happy to be done with that evil Bounceback express software."
4,Hot (literally) Laptop,"I love Macs, and this one delivers. It also delivers lots of heat. I have had the hard drive and battery replaced after just 9 months, and the power cord caught fire right at the MagSafe connector to the computer.Recommend buying a three yr. protection plan if you are buying an Apple laptop. By the way, due to heat issues, they no longer call them laptops, and recommend against using them on your lap or touching any body part."
4,Great System.,"This Macbook Pro is a great system. The newer versions are not as great due to the glossy, glass screen, the screen on this one is way better and clearer. This design has thus far been my favorite design of the Macbook Pro. OS X is a truly amazing OS, I strayed away from it for a little bit when I had capability issues with Leopard, but now that I have re-installed OS X Tiger everything works brilliant. If you want the most for your money, this and the Dell XPS are the best notebooks on the market."
1,Don't buy this -- keep on shopping!,"I've bought Apple computers for several years, the 2 most recent a Quad Power MAC G5 and a BRAND NEW Macbook Pro 15"" both from Amazon. When I say the Macbook Pro is brand new I mean less than a month old. The LCD has developed a problem which the local authorized repair center says is a manufacturing problem, but it is not covered under Apple Warranty.I just spent the past 1/2 hour talking with a snotty customer relationship manager ""Leela x40169"" who kept on telling me ""Apple doesn't have manufacturing problems"", when that didn't work, it was ""Amazon must have done something"", and then, I laughed at this one, ""You might have gotten a used one from Amazon... you know you need to be careful....""I would be very careful about purchasing the MacBook pro now."
1,bad apple less than one star,"I a going on y third repair. please forgive the letters in words that are not there. one of the proble s THERE ARE LOTS !!!! Rarely works for ore than an ho r at a ti e. wasted a year, lost work, always in the shop. TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!"
4,For those of you concerned about XP programs on this MAC,"I suggest checking out Apple's website and look up Bootcamp. It is an official Apple beta that will actually partition the harddrive on these MacBooks and create a driver cd so that you can install WindowsXP on the MacBook. All you will need is an install CD of windows. Once installed, you will be able to choose which OS to run, OSX or WinXP. From several comments out on the net, the MacBook will actually increase the performance of several programs that run on XP up to 20%.This is my plan, when I get it done, I will let you all know how it turns out."
5,Good things do come in small packages.,"This tiny bulb gives years of bright light for your task lamp. I am a reader and most of my evenings are spent buried in a book. This little light bulb gives me bright, concentrated light without eye strain from my reading lamp. When I decide to do any needlework, it also makes keeping up with stitches easier to see. Good things do come in small packages."
2,Burns out quickly,"The bulb was nice and bright and worked fine, but burned out after about two and a half months."
1,burned out prematurely,"hard to beat the convenience of finding and buying the right halogen bulb at your fingertips on amazon but this bulb burned out after a few hours (!) of use. the other halogen bulb i bought at the same time was from bulbrite and that one did better but also burned out after just a few months of light use. should have bought a six pack, or found a better manufacturer. apparently it does not pay to buy the cheapest product out there."
1,"Bad, very bad vendor","Did not receive this product even after two emials to company. Did not even get any respose from company, would NOT reccommend this compay to anybody."
1,Complete Junk,This is the second identical halogen bulb that I've ordered; both completely burned out in a matter of days. You'll find better value in an expensive halogen blub from your local hardware store.
3,Good tunes,I really miss this group havent heard much from them since Woodstock 99. I will give them 3 stars only because I want to see them live in Sacremento? Are they still around?
4,Big sound cool vibe.,Heard this band on CMJ's 1998 certain damage cd... where are they now?? Would like to purchase full album.
2,"Not as ""sexy"" as I expected","It has been a month or so, that I m using this shampoo and I don's see any good affect."
