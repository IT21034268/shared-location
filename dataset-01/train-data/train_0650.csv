2,One star for each laugh in the movie,"Sadly enough, if you were only comparing this movie to today's teen movie drivel it would rate five stars. Nevertheless, Pauly Shore is annoying (and looks frightenly feminine in several scenes), Sean Astin's character is so pathetic that he becomes an antagonist, and the plot drifts between non-existent and unbelievable (to the point where it interferes with your ability to enjoy the movie). Frasier is the only redeeming quality...you can tell he's having fun and it's fun to watch him in the process. Too bad his character didn't get rid of Shore and Astin when he first met them."
4,it really really sucks...,"...and I love it with all my heart, hehe. I mean, I'd never tell anyone to go rent it cos it's such a splendid piece of film, but golly darn do I adore it! I love the slang (my friend's face scrunched up and she asked ""is that English?"". That pretty much sums it up...), the clothes, the really really weird plot. And americanos, don't worry about the movie insulting exchange students; us ignorant foreigners just laugh at the stupid yanks in return :P... So, don't expect quality. If you can't take Evil Dead (also category Lousy movie but love it love it love it), don't watch this one. *smoooch to Brendan and Pauly*"
5,Pure Comedic genius!!,"Even if you hate comedies, you'll love this movie! This is the absolute pinnacle of Pauly Shore's stellar comedy career. You will not be disappointed!!"
3,A nice book,I found this book to be a good read. But it did not hold my interest. I had a hard time getting in the charaters' minds. I kept wishing that Tala was stronger. I think that Sherrilyn Kenyon or Susanne Brockmann are both better at the adventure/romamce story.
3,Could have been better,This is my first book by Ronda Thompson. She wrote a different take on werewolves.It started out somewhat slow. Tara didn't have to be so secretive. I thought it took her too long to explain herself and her brother got on my nerves. I know he was suppose to be the tribe's leader and protector of his sister but he came across as annoying.Jason was alright. I just had a hard time believing they were really in love since there were so many misconceptions both leading characters had of each other.
2,WTF,"yeah, I couldn't listen to this cd much. I listened to the first track and had to skim through the rest. This cd is crap, I'm glad I only paid a dollar for it.I only gave it 2 stars because the lyrics were somewhat creative."
5,"Great Crafts, Great Exposure to Other Cultures","This is a wonderful book with a range of easy to more complicated crafts for children from 4-8. We have done a number of the projects in here and not only do my children enjoy them, but they get some exposure to cultures outside of their own. There are suggestions for changing the art projects to incorporate more creative impulses as well. It's the one craft book I keep returning to because the ideas are so interesting."
4,Dash Mat,"Product matches the color of my dash perfect. Installation was easy, they gave me more than enough velcro stickums to do the job."
4,"Awesome Cables, But Expensive",These cables are professional looking; and work perfect. I only wish they were not so expensive. They are over-priced in my opinion.
4,Good product,"These definitely keep my sore nipples from chafing or sticking to my bra. They look funny thru my shirt, kinda like a pointy Madonna bra, but who cares when you're in agony from cracked nipples? My only complaint is that I wish I could wear them all the time. The directions say to not wear longer than 40 minutes at a time since they put pressure on your milk ducts. But, I'll take whatever relief I can get!"
4,New mom life saver,"I dealt with engorgement when my milk came in after the birth of my first child. These breast shells were my saving grace and helped me deal with the pain of sore nipples and even slightly helped with easing the engorgement issue as well. While they are not overly comfortable (they are plastic), they offer relief and I have continued to use them through breast feeding and the inevitable sore nipples that resurface at times."
2,Not what I hoped,"I ordered these because I had very sore nipples after nursing my daughter. I knew that exposing the nipple to air was supposed to help, so I thought these would work. However, I wasn't able to wear them. The shells are quite large, so unless you have a bra that is at least 2 cup sizes bigger than what you normally wear, they press into your breasts and become uncomfortable in a few minutes. I didn't want to order larger bras, so I couldn't use these. I never used the shells for catching leaked milk, so I can't comment on if that aspect of them."
2,Tried and failed,"I purchased these to attempt to use with my breast pump (Medela Freestyle) to ease the pain and to wear at night. Neither worked. The did not fit on the flanges and I lost a lot of milk when I attempted to use them with the pump. When I attempted to wear them to ease pain and collect breast milk, that also failed. The shape is weird (which means they cannot be worn without being very noticeable) and they seemed to leak no matter what I did. On top of that, they actually made me more sore. I would not recommend purchasing these."
4,Function over form,They look awful but if you have sore cracked nipples or inverted nipples they are the only thing that will really fix what's wrong. The good news is if you use breast shells when you need them for the above mentioned maladies- you won't have to use them for long because you will heal after just a few days even if you wear them part time. They come with little curved white sponges that you just drop in the bottom of the shell. These sponges absorb the milk that leaks so that you don't have to worry about it comming out of the vent holes at the top when you bend over. I just would rinse them with soap and water to clean and let air dry I think each breast shell set come with four sponges and you can buy more if you need them but 4 was enough for me. NOTE: don't use them to collect milk to give to your baby as one reviewer suggested. The milk collected in a breast shell is to be discarded as it states in the package instructions.
2,Itchy Shells,"They kind of worked but the soft backings made me itch and the little stoppers on the shells looked funny under shirts.... Later I tried Ameda's Breast Shells, they are A LOT better!! Check those out before you purchase Avent's Breastshells!!!!"
3,ok - nothing great,"this has helped, but I am not thrilled. I cant wear it for too long - the pressure it puts hurts if I wear it for more than 30-40 minutes or so. I'd prefer something I can wear atleast for a few hours - maybe a whole day and give my sore nipples a break - but thats not possible with this one."
3,A little overpriced,"These were good for sore nipples, although the instructions say not to use them for more than 40 minutes at a time to prevent excessive pressure on your milk ducts. The first 2 - 3 weeks you are sore almost 24 hours a day. I did not have any success on using them to catch leaking milk, as they are not shaped right for all nipple types and the milk leaked out under them into my bra. As for saving the leaked milk, the instructions say that you are only supposed to save the milk you collect during breastfeeding; you are supposed to throw any other milk away, as it could have become contaminated. When my son was about 3 months old I quit leaking altogether, even when he was nursing on the other side, so I never use them anymore. Not the best purchase, but great for the first two weeks or so."
4,Like Them,"I found them very comfotable for my sore nipples. They also collect leaking milk...but don't bend over as they will spill all over your feet (my first try). Other than this and having to wear a loose shirt to hide them, I will use them everyday instead of pads that get wet and irritate my nipples."
2,"weird shape, not what I hoped","I bought this for the leak side when I stay home, but the shape is weird, doesn't stay on breast very well. It's hard shell, not soft one that I hoped. when I put on with bra, feels hot; when took it off, the milk still spill out, lost the purpose.I will not recommend this, disposable pads works better."
4,Relief!!,"I've only had this product for two days but so far I LOVE it! I exclusively pump for my little guy and it is torture on my nipples. Putting these on right after I pump allows some room for my nipples to relax and heal. I can't wear them for very long, though, because I don't want to leak milk. So far, so good and the price is right."
3,Shells are very large,I just received this product and the shells are very large and look quite obvious when you wear them. I haven't used them yet and probably won't outside the house.
2,disappointed,"For the most part I am extremely pleased with avent products, which is probably why I was so disappointed in these breast shields. My mother gave me a pair of breast shields she used while nursing my sister 15 years ago and the avent breast shields did not even compare. They are only good for wearing while you are nursing and the rubber ring does not make the best seal to the plastic shield. You cannot move around very much while wearing the plastic shields that have holes for ventilation, which is a hinderance while taking care of baby. Since I leak throughout the day, these do not work too well for me."
5,este perfume es un clasico,Estoy muy satisfecho con la compra y les agradesco mucho por tan buenos productos que Ustedes comercoalizan me parecen muy apropiados. Gracias
5,Great CD of a Great Musical film,I have always loved this movie and for many years only the original soundtrack from the film was available. The sound quality was poor at best. This remastered version of the original is well worth it.
5,Yankee Doodle Dandy,"Excellent service and DVD. Would recommend to anyone, especially if your a James Cagney fan."
2,Shameful Editing Job! Go back to school engineers!?,"It's hard to knock this CD because I love this movie and music so much, but come on! This movie is a national treasure, therefore I am outraged at the lack of effort that went into the production of this soundtrack CD. Track after track gets murdered with abrupt editing and with dialog being chopped off in mid-sentence. A five year child could have done a better job. Then there are the pops, groans, and clicks throughout the CD to deal with, like a worn out 78. Come to think of it, I wouldn't be surprised if old 78's were used as the audio sources. Disgusting! All I know is that the audio on my VHS tape of the movie sounds 100 times better. Get this CD for the nostalgia value only, you've been forewarned. While I'm at it, where is the DVD version of this movie? Hopefully a lot more care and love might befall the DVD."
2,Buy Canon Photo Pro Paper Instead,"I ran out of Canon Photo Pro Paper while printing my vacation pics, and had a 20 piece trial pack of the Kodak Ultima Picture Paper that I broke out to try. I printed the same picture on both papers and the Kodak doesn't even come close to the quality of the Canon! Both papers were supposed to be glossy, but the Kodak is almost matte. The Kodak paper also seemed to be more pixellated looking, while the Canon paper is photo lab quality. I do not recommend Kodak Ultima Picture Paper (unless you are getting it near free, and giving the pictures to someone you don't really like that much)."
2,Huh?,"Mobb Deep, and this is the start of the decline. Their first 3 LPs were hip hop classics, pure, perfect mastery, and then this LP and those later - complete with club dance tracks with 50c are just whack awful. 2 out of 5 coz I can't give such masters of the past albums anything worse. damn"
5,Great Inflator,I have owned this inflator for over one year. I works great and has enough power to maintain the 85 psi required on my RV and Dually truck. As per the instructions it is very important to keep the unit charged. Do not run the battery down until it stops. If the battery wears out in the future it can be replaced.
2,Lead battery doesn't last long,I bought this unit over 2 years ago and used it to inflate the tires on our 3 vehicles. We would also use it on vacation to inflate pool toys and air mattresses. When it was new it would hold a charge long enough to inflate low tires on a car ( all 4) five to six times between charges. In the last six months or so the unit will only inflate 3 to 4 low tires before needing another charge. It still works fine when I plug it into a car's power outlet but then I have to hassle with the wire. It seems to me the lead battery should have lasted longer than this given how expensive this charger is.
4,Good Tent so far,"I bought this tent on amazon.com and it arrived right on time. The first time i opened the box it was missing one piece, but we were able to fabricate the wrong piece they gave us into the right one. Recently got back from a trip to Valentine Ne. Slept in the tent for 4 nights. It withstood 30 to 35 mph winds without any problem. Tent seems sturdy and holds fairly good heat."
4,Good dryer if you can ignore the loud thumping noise,"Dryer performs well, but...The only draw back so far is the poor material selection for the rubber rollers for the drum. They flatten out when the dryer is cold and not running so when you start the dryer it makes an annoying thumping sound for a few minutes until it warms up.In my experience with LG Service techs, they tend to put bandaids on the problem rather then fixing the solution and replacing the rollers with a better material.The thumping noise doesn't seem to have any impact on the performance of the machine."
2,fair dryer,we bought this dryer 4 -5 years ago. Last week the dryer would not heat up. Searched plumbing supply houses and they did not carry LG parts. Had to order on line. I replaced the ignitor but it still does not heat. It's amazing that you can't get parts for your dryer that is sold all over. The manual is totally useless. I will never buy another LG product again. Why should you have to pay a repairman just to do simple repairs?
4,Nice!,"Even if you didn't care for Charmian Carr's performance as Liesl (I didn't), you can still thoroughly enjoy this charming record of her memories of making and promoting the film. There's no denying the lasting appeal THE SOUND OF MUSIC has for millions of people, and Ms. Carr's book helps to understand why. I had a great time reading it!"
3,What Makes this Book Good?,"What makes this book good? Charmian Carr was able to convince many of the cast and crew of ""The Sound of Music"" to contribute stories about the making of the movie. What makes this book weak? There is too much information about Charmian Carr and her family life.Still, it's worth the read just to learn the interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits. Did Christopher Plummer really call it ""The Sound of Mucus?"" Did Julie Andrews get on well with the kids? Where is the real Maria Von Trapp in the movie?If you are a die-hard fan of the movie - this is the book for you."
4,Forever Liesl Sound of Music book,"I liked this book. Like many others I love the Sound of Music. This book is written with a positive spin on everything, so it seems a little contrived. She emphasizes the ongoing relationship between the actors that played the kids in the movie. I would have loved to have known more detail about the experiences in Austria and more of the background of the movie production. If you like the movie, you will like this book."
5,"A very good insight into the film, ""The Sound of Music.""","""Forever Liesl,"" is a wonderful book, written by Charmian Carr and Jean Strauss. In it she vividly recalls her days as Liesl, in, ""The Sound of Music."" It is a very entertaining and informative book. It makes for a great read. I recommend it to any fan of the film. It really hold your interests and is a well written book, with some lovely photos as well. I think it deserves all the stars it can get."
4,This book is Great!,"I had the pleasure of reading this book recently and had to give it good feedback. The book was very detailed and gave great insite on all the most memorable scenes. i will never watch the Sound of Music, the same way again. My only compliant is that it could have been a bit longer. Now all we need is the other six childen to write a book of their experience to see how each experience differed and was the same."
4,"Sweet, just like Liesl","Charmian Carr recounts her experience appearing as Liesl in the 1965 movie,The Sound of Music. She describes her background and that of the other children who were in the movie, their four-decades long friendship, and brings us up-to-date on their lives. Though she was 21 at the time of shooting, she spent little time off-camera with the film's stars, Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, but has lots of very flattering things to say about the director and producer, Robert Wise and Saul Chaplin.Even though I'd heard most of the stories before in interviews, this was still a very pleasant read about a movie that is a sentimental favorite of mine, told with all the youthful cheerfulness of the character of Liesl. I did question the strange order of the chapters and the emphasis placed on her own family and found the inclusion of fan letters to be a bit maudlin. With many behind-the-scene photos of the movie shoot, this is a book movie fans are sure to enjoy."
5,Forever Liesl: Forever wonderful!,"I received this book a few weeks ago and devoured it in the space of a few hours. For anyone who is as big a loser about The Sound Of Music as I am, there is no better way to nerd out than this :) I loved reading about Chris Plummer's acerbic wit and sarcasm, Julie Andrews' incredible professionalism, and anecdotes about all the ""Von Trapp"" children. Charmian's life story is quite sad at times, and about as far from the sweet and saccharine world of TSOM as it gets, but her stories about meeting the real Von Trapps and her experiences filming the movie are fantastic. I also found it interesting that she worked for Michael Jackson - she's had an interesting life! The letter from Nick Hammond is very sweet and touching, and it's clear she's very close to her celluloid siblings and greatly valued the experience of filming The Sound Of Music. Interesting fact - at the time of writing, she'd seen the movie a total of only nine times!"
2,Disappointing voice quality,"The headset is easy to use, holds a charge but I consistently got complaints about the voice quality. This was especially true in the car but that is when I need to use the headset. I had to quit using it and am now looking for another brand."
3,"For what you pay, o.k.","The HS820 worked very well with my E815 @ Alltel. I could hear everyone very well and everyone heard me very well also. Buttons are simple to use while wearing the ear piece. The problems I had were that it did not stay on to good if you were moving your head around quickly or leaning your head on it's side were the ear piece would become loose and feel like it was going to fall off. Riding in the car, the piece did not work well if there was any noise at all or the window was down. For a extra $20.00 I purchased the PT510 and found that it stays on very well and works in the car very good. You choose."
3,Good deal,"I got this bluetooth headset when Amazon had a deal. For the price (30$), it serves its major purpose which is to answer the phone and voice dial without having to touch the cell phone.The sound is good, the voice appears to be as well, but the only issue I have is that when it is connected to my phone and not being used, this headset randomly disconnects and reconnects itself."
4,Convenience On The Go,"I wasn't sure about this device. I like the idea of a wireless headset but have a thing about the blue flashing light. I've realized its not so bad and the convenience of having the connection when you need it is a benefit. The device was pretty simple to get up and running. The connection with the other caller is as good as using the handheld device. I'm not sure if this is a plus or a minus but once your cell signal is out of range, the headset does beep periodically until a signal is regained."
3,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset,"Works great when you in close distance with phone, but its develops static when you start distance yourself from the phone."
3,Fine Bluetooth,"This product is good looking, gloss in the dark. But the voice volume has to adjust every time after each recharge. Some times the volume is not loud enough."
1,Worthless devices makes you feel like you useing hearing aid,"This bluetooth i got because i thaught is will be good but not good design, not good fitting, not good clear voice and communication, not good range should be 30 feet but is quit working at 15 feeti wont't get this for even free."
2,needs more volume,"Bluetooth technology is a great idea, but this one does not have enough volume. It is too hard to hear when you are on a highway with any wind noise at all."
2,Works but spotty reliability,HS820 works but volume levels are low. In a quiet room the levels are acceptable however in a noiser environment poor. The headset looses connection with the handset repeatedly over the course of the day. Also the SLVR had to be power cycled to reconnect to the headset some times. The blue LED is very distracting. Overall an inexpensive headset whose 29.99 price is really what it should be and never higher.
1,WOULDN'T PAIR WITH MY RAZOR,"the earpiece looks good, but wouldn't establish a link with my phone. I have a motorola razor from verizon. the phone just didn't detect it at all. couldn't get it to work no matter what i did."
1,Amazon shipping model is bad,"Hi All,Looks like the bluetooth is used one. The shipping package is too bad. its not showing any company motorola name on the package. i am not satisfied with amazon is selling like this."
1,Bluetooth w/Blackberry,Opened package with new Blackberry and tried to charge the Bluetooth headset. Blue light would not come on and contacted Motorola for help. They advised that the only answer was to return the headset for a new one--different type since they don't make this one any longer.
5,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset,I am very happy with this product. I have had it for a month now and can't believe I lived without it for so long. I do alot of calls and it is nice to not have to hold my phone and just speak. It is very clear and people tell me that my voice is clear without static.
2,very loose fit,"Works okay, but has a very loose fit for me. Buy plantronics 655 or something in the same series - plantronics fits well, works well, and sounds great for user and person called."
2,Just ok - IOGear was better,This died after 6 months and Motorola replaced with another model that was worse. Warranty replacement process took a long time.I am comparing against the IOGear that I ended up purchasing. The motorola just didn't sound as clear to me or the person on the other end.
3,works well sometimes,I got this and used it with my old moto v360 and it worked ok. The battery life was good between chargings but I found it difficult to hear clearly at times and others on the phone with me complained a few times about distortions. However these were only a few times. (if I could I would give it 3-1/2 stars)
3,bluetooth headset,"It worked good for a few months. Gradually, it began loosing its quality. People have trouble hearing now. I am also getting ""static"" and cannot use very much. Works a little better in my cell phone than Skype. Overall, I do not reccommend it."
4,Good,"I worked well until i lost it week 2. it doesnt get very loud, which isnt great for noisy environments, but in the car/elsewhere it worked very well. No battery issues, very lightweight, and easy setup. I recommend it."
1,Only the price is right. You get what you pay for.,"I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking. This device does not cancel out background noise. Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the ""pinhole"" for the internal microphone. There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise. This is a defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking. The ""ear attachment"" and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic. As a result the fit isn't tight enough. I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat. It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side, I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use."
4,Pretty good product,"This is good for occasional use(I wear it in the car) but I dont think it would be comfortable to wear all the time. No problems hearing. Overall, good for the price."
3,Good deal for good price,Simple and compact looks. Fits comfortably. Decent sound quality. Easy to set up. Simple operation.One con: The mic is not so good. People on the other side sometimes complain about not being able to hear loud enough.
2,Worked great while it worked,"This came free with my order for a Razr from Amazon. I was able to pair it with my cell phone and my PC (for use with Skype) without too much difficulty. Getting it connected to either device was a confusing process. The documentation wasn't much help. I think the people who wrote it were even more confused than I was. However, once connected, it worked perfectly. The sound quality was better than any corded headset I've ever used. Then after one week, it died - completely unresponsive. I called Motorola and the person I talked with had problems understanding the difference between a headset and a telephone. Finally, when she realized I had had it for only a week, she suggested I return it to the store where I bought it. Now I'm waiting to see how good a job Amazon does of resolving this."
5,Bluetooth Headset,"The headset is exactly as shown online. It arrived on the stated date and has worked very well. Speaker & microphone are excellent quality. It is comfortable to wear, the pairing was fast & easy. I use it with my Motorola RAZOR. No complaints."
4,Great headset,I am very pleased with this headset. My only complaint is that I wish I could get more volume sometimes. Well worth the VERY good price!
4,Nice Piece of equipment,The part that fits on your ear kinda digs into the back of your ear if worn for a long time but otherwise i can't find any real problems with it. Its a bargin.
1,Never could pair this,"I tried many things, and could never get this to successfully pair with any of my cell phones. I should have returned it when I had the chance. Maybe it's defective. I have another Motorola headset and know how to pair that one; this one does not respond to the same steps. Useless waste of money."
3,sent back to Motorola,This bluetooth did not last me a year. I called Motorola for a replacement. They sent another model and I've been using it for four years now.
3,Motorola HS820 Bluetooth,Not a bad ear piece for the price. Newer ones easier to use and wear. Battery life not so life on this one.
3,Can you hear me,"I used it for 2 weeks and was over it, cool sleek style but unfortunately cant be used walking but good for driving....so its the now the car ear piece in case i leave my preferred one home :>"
1,Another landfill donation,"It wouldn't hold a charge almost from the start and then the volume button quit working. Add to that a giant, blinking, blue light on the side. If you have it on at night you worry that airplanes will land on your head. Whomever invented the ""on"" light should be shot. You know how you can tell if it's on??? It's working!!!!"
3,Keeps falling off my ear!,"I consider this headset an average headset. It was relatively cheap and works as advertised. However, it does not hang on my ear very well. In fact, it usually falls off when I move my head in any fashion quickly.Sound wise, I can think of much better ear pieces with better sound quality, but it works.I ended up also getting a Plantronics 510, it has a mute button on the headset, stays on my ear and is very loud and clear. I use this Motorola headset as my backup in case the Voyager dies."
5,Motorola HS820,"I have owned this bluetooth for well over a year. really no complaints. The units dis-connects from the phone when you get about 20 feet from the phone, but re-connects automatically.Ease of use , it's a must have for people who use a cell phone alot especially while driving."
5,Excellent price for an excellent value,"I just recieved my HS820 BT. I bought it after some window shopping the different brands. I found that the Motorola BT headsets have been rated fairly well. So when i saw this one at the incredible price(much lower than anywhere else, that ive seen), i jumped all over it. I have to say that pairing the headset was extremely painless. I have a LG LX350 and i can hear and be heard very well. But make sure you adjust the headset volume on your phone as well as using the little silver buttons on the headset itself. After i did this i had no problem hearing anyone. I have tested the device only to about 15 ft and it seems to perform really well. Overall i think this is a great buy! 100% recomended."
4,Decent Bluetooh headset,"I have used no others, but this one, paired with the RAZR works well. Standard complaint, volume is too low. Audio quality is great. Can switch between the RAZR and HS820 seemless while on a call.- low audio volume.- on/off is awkward ... another button would be nice.- would have been nice if the RAZR and HS820 used the same power charger.Questions - is the battery replacable ?"
4,Got a RAZR...Get a headset,It can be a little hard to hear the people you're talking to on the RAZR. This headset takes care of that problem. I can always hear fine and others have no problem hearing me...with no yelling. Volume controls could be better but it's still a great accessory.
1,Can't hear other person while driving....,"I bought this HS820 & Motorola V360. Before that I was using SonyEricsson T610 and Jabra headset.Pros:. Impressive look. Lightweight. Low priceCons. Can't hear clearly while drivingI use headset mainly while driving, and it fails there miserably. Time to throw this HS820.I am switching back to Jabra headset."
4,What an awesome item!!,"Not only did standard shipping get my item quickly to me....it works great! It's so easy to use and the initial setup was very quick and painless! The Motorola Headset is an awesome, durable product. And the price! It was so inexpensive compared to the retail stores! Thank you Amazon.com!!!"
2,Had to return...,"I returned this item as soon as I got it because even with the volume turned all the way up the headset wasn't loud enough for any conversation outside of a sound-proof booth. The device did not rest on the ear very securely either, I always felt like it was going to fall off at any moment."
3,hs820 headset,"Generally an ok generic headset (certainly for the sale price), but not very good in loud areas or if you have trouble hearing. The headset's volume does not go loud enough for me to hear unless I am using it in a somewhat quite environment."
2,Only thing I like...Price,Volume!!! - I can barely hear it when I drive.Sometimes it makes my RazrV3m disconnect.. I don't know it's my Razr has problem or what...I'd rather go Jabra?? (my friend has one but I don't know the model No.)
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL.....",This is one of the worst things I have ever spent money on....I can't even use it anymore...You can't hear the person talking to you not even from close proximity even 2 feet...and your voice to the other person you are talking keeps going in and out constantly...HORRIBLE!!!!DON'T EVEN BOTHER UNLESS YOU LIKE THROWING YOUR MONEY DOWN THE TOILET...IF SO THAN THIS IS FOR YOU !!!!!
1,Stupid headset,"Dosen't even stand for 15 minutes. Need to have a separate charger for the mobile and headset, trickier marketting strategy, but no good to buyer, 2 chargers @ car and 2 chargers @ home. Razar family looks sexy just like Microsoft windows, but no good brain. I wish Amazon should consider adding a ""0"" rating in the ""How do you rate this item"" drop down box."
1,Poor quality device,The device worked very poorly. Most people felt like they were on a speakerphone. The device also flapped against my face with any movement.
2,Worked great for me. Awful for the person on the other end.,"This device is very compact and incredibly lightweight. It feels so much like a toy at first I thought I had purchased a display model by accident. Its' small size and presumably few internal components is also detrimental to its' performance. I used it for a week. Every caller said I sounded as though I was talking as normal. They would hear an echo of their own voice however, delayed a fraction of a second, which they found very annoying. A short term fix is to lower your earpeice volume, and you can see the downsides of that. Well, when my girlfriend is not happy then I'm not happy, back it goes. Sorry, Motorola, nice try though. If irritated callers are not a problem for you, then this is a great product. It's easy to sync, easy to use, and voice recognition works just as great with the headset as without (on my e815)."
2,"it works very well for you, until you ask the other person talking to you","I was very happy when i tested my hs-820, everything seemed fine until everyone i talked with started to complain about the same problem: a really bad reception with strong voice echo. I tested it calling my self and it was terrible, the echo is as loud as your voice !!!. Now im returning this, dont buy this."
2,Caller hears loud echo,"Well, like many others, I also have to complain about the echo that callers hear. I paired this headset with a Motoroloa E815. You would think Motorola headsets would work best with their own phones. I went to a Verizon store to discuss the problem. It turns out that during our testing, the echo was most prevalent when the caller was another Verizon cell phone. Landline calls did not hear the echo. I had the same problem with TWO other headsets: a replacement HS820 *and* the HS850. So, buyer beware. Be sure to test before the return data expires..."
1,no go on Treo 650,"a couple problems with this headset, when using it with the Treo 650 -1. it does not automatically connect when a call is received or initiated2. the volume is way too lowcheck out the Jabra JX10, Cardo Scala, or Palm Treo headset ---- there are too many great headsets out there, to settle for this onehappy shopping!"
1,Not enough volume!,I ended up replacing this unit with another. It simply does not have enough volume for me. I drive a fairly nice vehicle that is quiet on the highway but this thing is not powerful enough to even overpower the road noise.
5,I LOVE IT!!,"I spent about 3 hours talking on it last night, and my cell phone battery died first. The over-the-ear hook is very comfortable, I hardly notice that its there after a while. The range is great, you can walk away from your phone into another room and still get decent signal. The sound is clear and can be turned up pretty loud without losing clarity. The mic is good, never had anyone ask me to repeat myself cause they couldn't hear me. Easy to install, easy to use, easy to charge, a must for anyone who's looking to upgrade from the cord-connected earpieces."
1,Waste of your money,"Unless you're willing to constantly charge this item and have no problem in re-setting your cell phone to recognize the headset with every use, you shouldn't waste your money on this item!"
3,bluetooth headset,"this is one of few headsets that would fit my ears.however, because of the design, one compromises from truly talking into the microphone without filtering out the surrounding noise."
5,Excelent Product,"I bought it for my Wife who is not very please with the ear pices,she said they are uncorfortables and she is delighted with this blue tooth a real hands free with great sound quality."
3,Motorola HS 820 Bluetooth,Product is kind of fragile.Did not feel like it sat in the ear well.Hard to hear.Needed volume all the way up all the time.In a quiet room is great.Also range was exceptional more than what I expected.Not bad for the price.
3,Half & Half,At first this headset seemed to be the best one I'd used (other was the Motorola HS850). It is better than the HS850 but I hated it because it constantly loss connection with the phone that I have(A Motorola RazrV3)and that really made me angry. I'd get ready to call someone and found that it had dissconnected itself.It stopped working after about 3 months and Motorola is sending me a different headset. Hopefully the new HS815.Anyways buy it if you're just looking for a basic headset and not for constant use. Don't pay more than $29.99.
3,Cheap and gets the job done just fine,"First off I don't use this unit full time and it actually sits in my console in my car most of the time. From my limited use however, it has worked just fine - if you have a motorola phone, the directions it comes with walk you right through the menus and you should have it up and running in a few minutes. It is comfy but I'd say after about 15 minutes you feel it start to bug your ear a little bit. Being a motorola guy, I also like that it recharges using the same connection my last two phones used (the little vampire fangs), and it came with an additional charger. This amounts to me leaving extra chargers I've accumulated at friends/family's houses ""just in case"" (one less thing to remember while packing)! I'm not sure what the other more expensive units offer but if you're buying it primarily for car usage like me, this unit is more than adequate and costs little more than the wired units did a few years back."
3,Decent value for the price,"The connection between my cell phone and blue tooth is lost if i am a little outside 8ft vicinity. So, if you're expecting better connectivity HS820 might not be what you're looking for.Otherwise, its a decent trade for the price."
3,Mediocrity...,"This headset worked well enough, though sometimes people on the other end complained of hissing noises or buzzing or that they just couldn't hear me loud enough though I was practically yelling in a quiet room. I could normally hear ok, but I wish that the volume could get a little louder. I sent one unit back to Amazon, thinking that I'd just had a defective headset, but the second one proved to have the same problems."
5,HOW EASY CAN IT BE TO TALK,"one of the better bluetooth headset and a cost effective product that I have ever purchsed...easy to use. Just press one button and u are ready to talk phone freeHOW EASY CAN IT BE,nb"
2,Good Product,"I purchased two of the headsets from Amazon. The finsih is nicely done on these. The buttons are very conviently located and there is no searching for them as on other headsets. You really cant feel the weight on your ears as they are very light. The product does hold onto your ear securley, and comfortably so long as there is not wind gusts. My only dislike about this product is that the speaker volume was not very loud for me. I have an inear Jabra and the volume is twice as loud as these Moto's. This is the only downside to this product in my oppinion. Reception on the other end was fair."
4,Decent Bluetooth For The Money,"I purchased this bluetooth about a month ago, so in writing this review I have given myself ample time to test all the features and faults (if any) of this particular product. I have experienced no echo whatsoever with the unit, all seems to work fine. Everybody I speak to says they hear me fine and I can hear my calls as well. The max volume could be a little louder overall but the volume is fine as is. The features are extremely simple to use and learn, so I found myself using the unit with ease in no time. To date, there is only 1 flaw I have found with the unit. There is a blue light on the side of the bluetooth that blinks every so often (about once or twice every 5 minutes). There is no way to de-activate the blinking, it always will keep blinking as long as you use it. That was the only flaw I found. But if you are anything like me, the price, functionality, and quality made me keep it. (I just dont like the blinking blue light) LoL... Take Care All..."
4,Compact design,I like the compact design and fits easily over the ear. Sometimes the device sounds blurry after bonding with my phone. I have to restart both my cell phone and the HS820 to get best results.
2,It's ok,I purchase this product because it was on sale and needless to say you get what you pay for. The plastic ear peice that holds it on to your ear doesn't fit well and feels like it is going to fall off. The connection isn't all that great either. If your looking for something to work properly and without a fuss this isn't the product you want.
2,Not very good,"I've using the Motorola HS820 bluetooth headset for over a month now. I must say that it is far from the best in the market. It is firstly not very comfortable on your year neither is too light. It was designed only for the right ear, so say u've been talking for long using ur right ear and u wanna shift it to ur left, u can't! The most disappointing feature in the phone is the clarity which very very bad.. What the other person says seems unclear and incoherent. I got this product free with my purchase of the phone but if you otherwise wanna purchase the product, i recommend u don't."
5,Pleased Customer SO FAR!,"After purchasing another brand and 1 other model of motorola that I was dissattisfied with, I have been very pleased with the Motorola HS820. The reception is great. The people I talk to do not hear any background noise or hissing of any kind. Matching it with my phone was a breeze compared to the other 2 models I purchased and my phone is not a Motorola. I have a LG(LX350V13). I AM VERY PLEASED SO FAR!!"
2,a cheap piece of hardware,"Wrestling with the recharging plug, made this item useless within days. When it worked, it had to be held to the ear for better communication...I may as well hold a phone to my ear."
2,"Flimsy, low volume and loses sync","My doctor tells me I have excellent hearing, so I feel confident saying this thing is near-impossible to use in a loud environment. I don't like the way it adheres to my ear, and worst of all I find myself having to re-sync it to my device two or three times a day (though that may be the device it connects to, my Treo 650)."
4,It works for me!!,"I received my bluetooth yesterday and it compared with my samsung T509, the newer phone from T-mobile just fine. So far I have no problems."
1,Amazon svcks! They sell OEM items w/o making it clear!,"I was shocked that when I received it, it has no packaging whatsoever except the shipping box. How can Amazon sell an OEM item without spelling it out clearly??? Amazon really terrible."
1,looks like refirbished item,"I used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and I lost it, so I ordered this since this is much much cheaper than my previous one.Different from the previous peice, this item came in with extremely cheap package and it's sound quality is worse than my previous one. My friends complained about the ECHO and noise sometimes so I suspect if this is actually a refurbed one. Sometimes the manufacturer sell such items for much less with simplized packaging."
3,HS820,It is an okay prodeuct for the price. Its range is very small and it is just good to use while driving
2,Can you hear me now?!,"I purchased this bluetooth headset after reading many reviews of many different headsets. But, unfortunately, there are some things you can't find out about a product untill you use it yourself. I was so excited when I first started using it because the voice quality on my end was excellent! I actually preferred it to my phone. It was very comfortable to wear as well. But everyone kept saying, ""I can't hear you."" I could put my hand up to my face for the sound to bounce off and they could hear me much better.. but that kind of defeats the hands free feature, doesn't it?! So, I'm back to square one in search of a better bluetooth and afraid of getting burnt again."
1,Terrible sound quality,"Granted its a cheap headset, but its not worth the money - useless with any background noise such as while driving a car on the highway."
2,specifications,"Concerning the Motorola HS820 bluetooth:1) I have use this model before and it worked fine.2) I purchased this model again for a new cellphone.PROBLEM: My new cell used bluetooth ver. 4.0 and I discoveredthe HS820 only has ver. 2.1 approx.; thus my new cellphonecould not recognize or link. (Thus a waste of money for me)3) If the item details and specs. would have been available,I would have noted the problem and looked for a workableunit."
1,Absolute Garbage,"I was replacing a Plantronics 220 that had given me 3 years of faithful service with this Motorola. Out of the box, the charger connector was too loose to keep a tight connection so had to be placed ""just so"". After full charge it took several tries to pair the set to my phone. Volume was good, but none of the several options using the multi button could be accessed. No voice dial could be used; no redial function and if you pressed the function button a ""hair"" too long the headset muted itself. It took deleting it from the phone, re-pairing the set. Seems this ""New"" motorola bluetooth is either defective or a return that was placed back into service and sold as new.I am ordering a Plantronics and will not take the time to get an RMA. Not worth my time and trouble. Sad for the dealer that sold this junk and Motorola for poor product.btw, my phone is a Motorola Razr V3, a perfect match for the HS820 headset; so I was told. NOT! Do not buy this headset..."
3,"so-so, but good price!","Battery life is fantastic, but makes unit weigh a little more than the others. Has some reception problems with some crackling issues, but all and all is tolerable. Best feature about this unit is the low price you get here at amazon, but if you want high quality this is not the unit for you. Overall I gave it a 3 star rating because of the excellent, and I stress EXCELLENT battery life. I charge the unit only once a week and use it daily, sometimes for an hour at a time. Recharge time is about an hour, so that is nice too. If price is your main concern it is worth its price."
2,Doesn't Fit Well. Broken in 2 weeks. No retail Box.,"1) It doesn't fit tightly on my ear. I nod my head and it falls down. It seems like it's designed for bigger ears.2) After using it lightly for over 2 weeks, it broke. When I answered a call, all I heard was a buzzing sound. The person at the other end could hear me, but I couldn't hear him.3) The headset came in a small plastic bag. No retail box. It seemed like cheap quality and like straight from the Asia.But during the time it was working, it provided good volume, I could hear the conversations & the mic worked great."
4,Pretty good headset for the price,"This headset is pretty good for the price offered. the only drawback is hard to hear someone when driving. Otherwise everything else looks good. Lightweight, easy to use, battery life is good."
3,Looks good but mediocre performance.,"The price was right but I have had to sync with my phone several times because the headset failed to work. Sometimes my family or friends can hear me well and other times I sound like I'm in a vacuum (according to them). Also a little heavy/awkward on the ear and no way to adjust it. Suggestion, spend a few more dollars for a better product."
3,not too bad,I got this from amezan.com.it is good.only thing is amezan did not sent me the original box of this item.it works verry well.good valu for my mony.
2,Below Average,Works pefect if the phone is within 5 ft of the bluetooth headset. Otherwise its garbage.
2,Beware: Pegaditos = Megamix,"I bought the Historia Musical thinking that I would be getting something like a greatest hits album where I could get all of Los Angeles Azules' best songs. I did...sort of. What I wish I had known when purchasing the cd is that the songs are all back to back in an extended mix and do not really stand on their own.The low rating is for the way the cd is put together, not for the music itself. Listeners who want an extended mix of all the songs might be happy, but I would not recommend it."
4,great compilation,"it is a very good cd, except for the continuation between songs. it has pretty much all of the hits of Angeles Azules, and it includes a video. you are getting your money's wort, except for that simple fact. no stop and silence in between tracks."
4,Excellent,"This is an excellent Australian crime novel.The sub-plot concerning Claudia's search for her father is compelling and poignant and, to me, far more interesting that the search for the missing girl, Madalena Grimaldi.This book serves to effectively de-romanticise Sydney with its depictions of the demeaning squalor and degradation faced by the homeless in that city."
3,Okay then boring,Marele Day starts off with great intentions - then the story goes flat and dies. She tries to emulate Patricia Cornwell poorly
5,"""Citizen Washington,""The way history should be taught.","Truely entertaining, informative, accurate, enjoyable to read. Some language not suitable for young teenagers in my opinion, but a superb historical novel."
5,The Best Martin Has Written....So Far,"This novel was one of the most informative books I have ever read. Not only did we get a run-down on the usual suspects of the era, Jefferson, Adams, and Washington, but the insight gained on the characters which history misses sometimes, like Alexander Hamilton, Henry Knox and Martha Washington made the book very hard to put down. The way Martin intermingles fictional and non-fictional characters is a work of genius. This novel is a fast-paced, fast-reading tale which NEVER bogs the reader down with an endless string of statistics and facts. The story is always the most important part of the book, and Martin hit a home run spinning this tale. I would recommend this novel, obviously to any Martin fans, but also to anyone who has wondered what historical fiction is like. I can not wait for his next novel!!!!"
2,Context needed,"While there is no doubt that Naipaul is a beautiful writer, I found this book to be frustrating. None of the excerpts were presented within any context so that I couldn't tell when the actual work was written, how far into the book the excerpt fell, or in some cases, if it was even fiction or non-fiction.In addition, the book desperately needed an introduction that would explain why these individual excerpts were chosen and perhaps more importantly, why Naipaul is an important writer.It seems to me that Vintage just wanted to earn some quick cash on this one without any investment.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that even a terrible presentation can't ruin Naipaul's writing completely."
5,Great Choice For New Comers,"It's come to my attention from a Wikipedia article about the lawyer, Jack Thompson(He's a lawyer who is trying to fight against the videogame industry and wants to censor violent videogames), that an Amazon reviewer gave his book a 5 star rating during what JT called a bookstorming and that review was removed (They filled up the book with negative tags, photoshopped pictures, and 1 star reviews). The positive review was by a user called BushSupporter who appears to be against Skinny Puppy as well as videogames. Anyway, if you're here because you hate Jack Thompson and are curious about the band you may want get this CD. This is probably Skinny Puppy's most accessible album along with The Greater Wrong of the Right and Rabies."
3,Skinny Puppy The Rock Band?,"When I first heard this album... I fell in love with it... it was very catchy melodious (not bad things), however, this is also what eventually somewhat turned me away from it... these are not the factors I usually look for in SP. It really is a great album, and had someone else who was a little more famous for this sound made it, I would have liked it much more. Although they would enjoy it, this is not really the best album for first time Puppy listeners, as it kind of gives the wrong impression of their musical style. 'Candle', 'Cult', and 'Blue Surge' make it a worthwhile purchase, though."
3,Aint grown on me yet!!!,Rare CD to fine... i found it for a good price here on amazon! this album was released 1996 so yeal they took a few years off. The Process is the eighth studio album so that would give them a lot of time to change the process sounds alot differnt from other albums.Hardset head & Cult & Candle; would have to be my favorites.I dont know no how many times i have to listein to this album to get into it maybe some day i will realey like it.
2,Not worth it.,"I have been preparing for my GED for quite awhile now and have utilized numerous books. This book was by far the most useless of all. The practice questions we often pointless and the study advice was more common sense than anything else. At the end of the book, they include final practice tests that seem to be more comical than useful. I had a hard time taking the practice tests without criticizing the book consistently. I suggest the Kaplan GED self study guide 2007-2008 edition. At least the Kaplan book seems to take the 5 subjects serious and is successful in treating the reader as if they have a i.q. higher than a newt. Sadly, the GED for Dummies book fails to accomplish this."
4,The GED for Dummies,"I sent it to a young man in prison, so I can only rate this according to the other ""dummies"" book. He was very excited about receiving it and it is helping him get his GED."
1,native american hobbyist/fake,"The book attempts to authenticate third-rate paintings of Native Americans, by a non-Native. Isn't it strange how non-Native hobbyists always write the books and are the 'experts'? The book is an example of colonization of Native American art."
3,replacement head for QB77 Sop Mop,"The concept is what I'm looking for but the mop is a little too long to use in most cases. However, it will be used for such things as a rack of ribs and I decided not to go through the hassle of sending it back. The cost of shipping would negate the value of the item."
2,This book has inaccurate information about Alaska,"I felt that while this book is a fast pace read, there are some errors that greatly bring down the value of this book. The Iditarod was run to provide medicine for diptheria, not smallpox as is stated in the book. The dog museum is in Cinicinati, not in San Francisco. While this is corrected in the end of the book, it should have been correct all throught the book. The most grievous error though is that Doris and Richard were not provided a home within there village. A home in the village would be found for children in their circumstances. I feel this book should have been better researched."
2,Disappointed,"I love all of Judy Garland's work and this early concept type of work I thought I would like better than I did. It was an early attempt, and probably very innovative in its time, but seems lacking today. However, any dedicated Judy Garland fan like myself will want it anyway."
5,GARLAND,THIS IS A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF GARLAND VOICE BOTH SINGING AND TALKING. THE ALBUM IS UNIQUE AMOUNG THE MANY ALBUMS THAT SHE HAS AVAILABLE.
4,What happened to the women characters?,"As a fan of this long series, I would give this installment a higher rating than the one before it. But by now, how few women characters remain! Only Flora, after Mary the Terrorist is executed very early on. Either women aren't active in wartime (not true) or Turtledove's fans, being mostly male, won't notice the gradual disappearance of Sylvia, Anne et al."
3,Review,It is the fascinating continuation of the Turtledove alternative thread. Reading the stories is like visiting old friends; a good page turner.
4,Drive to the East Review,I enjoy reading this book. I find Harry Turtledove's humor highly entertaining and I look forward to reading more of his work.The book is in wonderful condition and I am glad to have found it.
5,Please Mr. Turtledove rewrite all of human history,This book as well as his whole series is incredible. I've read some other posts wishing the CSA had exterminated the slaves well that's just proof that the real Civil War was won by the right side. Union forever and Turtledove too.
4,A very good read but . . .,"Drive to the East possesses the strengths of Turtledove's other ""alternative histories"" but is weaker in a few regards. The plot moves forward well, the physical descriptions are convincing, and the characters invite emotional investment. In addition, Turtledove has just enough departures from the constant parallels with World War II for the book to remain credible and for the villain, Featherston, to retain a few ""human"" qualities. However, too much of the necessary character development took place in previous novels for this book to stand alone. Also, while the killing off of Confederate characters shrinks the number of points of view to something that no longer suggests a three-ring-circus, it also produces an imbalance in the novel. Despite this peccidillos, the book remains a very good read."
4,DRIVE TO THE EAST,"Only about 100 pages into the novel. It is comparable to the others in the series. Wish Harry would drop the other books he's doing and just finish this.Only problem I have is the language. Must have a ghost writer from Deadwood. Way, way too many ""f's"" and ""gd's"". Not needed. The editor could have done a better job."
1,"No surprises here, unfortunately.","Wish I could like this book. I'm from south of the Mason-Dixon, and enjoyed the premise, an independent Confederacy, when Turtledove started out with it. But I hate Jake Featherstone, hate his party and state, and don't like the idea of Southerners being Nazis, much less how this series is going to turn out.If you know your World War II history, the ending is way too predictable. Turtledove seems on course to re-enact, in a couple more books, the entire squalid course of the Third Reich, complete with Dachaus, defeat and the end in the Fuhrerbunker. A twist would be nice, say a successful bomb plot, but no sign of one. Don't know if I'll keep buying these or not."
1,Defective on Arrival,"This unit was sold as ""new"" but when it arrived the box looked like it had been opened and taped shut. The instructions say to plug unit A into unit B and assemble by attaching unit C. My box contained only A and C, no B, so it was returned for credit (I had to pay the return postage). I will never order from this supplier again."
1,completely ineffective,"This product has done nothing to curb our pest issues in our backyard area. It does not seem to affect any above ground creature at all that I can tell. I looked out the window one evening to see a rat sitting about 2 inches away from it, completely unaffected. We still have squirrels, racoons, and mice. Though the blue jays don't seem too fond of the noise it produces."
2,Not effective in the long run,"I bought 3 of these for my mother's yard because she was having major problems with mole runs. When the repellers were first installed in early summer, it seemed that they might be working because mole activity decreased a lot. However, this was also when the wet weather ended and the hot, dry period started. Shortly after we got a fair amount of rain, the mole activity resumed. I think that the moles had just gone deeper underground when it was very hot and dry. The repellers are still beeping, so they have not broken, but they are ineffective."
2,Does not work for me,"Pros: Looks very well built, the plastic quality is good, battery compartment has rubber seal to provent water leak, so suitable for outdoor usage. The solar charges enough power to operate the device.Cons: Although, the device is running no problem, it does not work for pest repellance at all. I put is one feet under the tomato plant, the fruit was eaten the third day it was installed by chickmuk. Ok thinking maybe the tomoro is too delicious to resist for them. Move this near some plain plants, the next day, three plants were eaten to the root. Looks like it attract the animal come to here?"
2,Warning---Short life span,"I was very happy with this repeller. However, it only worked for 3 months, then quit. I contacted the company and they said the solar battery was probably not charging. They said if I would fax my receipt, they would send another one. I did so that very day;that was 6 weeks ago and I have not received a new product. You cannot get to the batteries to replace them yourself, I tried. Now when I call their customer service number, all I get is a busy signal. So beware!After I posted this review, I got through to the company and they informed me that the unit was on back order and finally arrived. They said I should be receiving my new unit shortly...hope it lasts longer this time."
1,Solar Pest repeller,"I purchased two of these to try to control moles that had invaded our neighborhood. At the time they were not running rampant in my yard. I have had the the two repellers installed for around a month. Since I have started using this product the moles have been attracted to them (as stated in the product guide). The only problem is they will not go away and keep coming back to my flower beds.Before spending money on this product, do your homework and research moles. They reportedly are more numerous when the ground is moist, which is what has happened this year. Traps and poisons can remedy the problem but they will still come back.This product did not work for me at all."
3,More info would have been better,"I would have liked to know that this product works best when there is another one within the 6000 sq. ft. it is supposed to protect from pests. After I received the first one I ordered and I found out it's best to have two I ordered another one. It would have been easier for me to order 2 the first time.Regarding their effectiveness.... so far (August), my melons look good.....free from any rodent pest damage."
3,Sunforce 80001 Solar Pest Repeller,"I think I'm seeing less Chipmunks running around the yard, but initially they just continued to dig holes right next to the Repeller. This item was designed for moles, so maybe it was expecting too much for it to work on Chipmunks. It was easy to install and non-toxic."
1,bad surprise,"I expect new items to be in original packaging but this was in a plain large box in 2 pieces with no instructions, no manufacturing info, no troubleshooting info, no nothing. How long does it need to be exposed to the sun to work? Does it make sounds? How deep should it be placed? Not a clue."
4,no moles in my garden,"placed two of these in my 20'x 30' garden one month ago and the moles have stayed away from my vegetables. The moles, however are still around. If I didn't have the sunforce products, I am sure they would have ate everything."
4,WORKS GREAT,INSTALLED IN MY YARD. HAVEN'T HAD A NEW MOLE HILL SINCE. CHASED THEM OUT OF MY YARD AND THAT IS ALL I CARE ABOUT!!
1,waste of money,This product is completely worthless. It seems to draw more critters like the pied piper. Plus there is a buzz every few seconds that drives us all crazy.
2,Is it actually working?,"I don't know if this thing is working, my gut tells me no. I've had it in several months now and I'm still seeing mounds and tunnels throughout my yard. Not to mention the squirrels just stand on top of these to taunt me. So no it probably isn't working at all. Wouldn't recommend in Florida."
1,waste of money,purchased 4 of these for a large back yard. left them in place plenty of time for them to take effect per the directions. 2 of them made no sound at all 2 of them made noise but had no effect whatsoever. They are made cheaply also. When I went to pull them out to return them two of them broke so they can not be returned and I'm out about $100. I read the mixed reviews but thought I'd give it a try anyway. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Solar pest repeller,These things don't work. We have had them before and they were wonderful and did the job but these do nothing and we are out the money for 2 of them.
4,"So far, works great","Have been using the mole repeller for about 1 month and no new mole holes in the back yard. I plan on purchasing at least 1 more for the front yard. The moles in our neighborhood have been excessive this year but so far, this particular mole repeller has worked. Squirrels are another subject, they just look at it. We are very satisfied with this product."
2,Wife's Garden,"I was tasked by my wife to rid her garden of the voles. Unfortunately, this is not the device for that task. Our Garden is very small at approx 150 sq ft. We purchased one of these and placed it in the center. Even though the unit appears to be operating correctly, the voles are tunneling within 4 inches of the unit. They don't seem to be affected by this unit. Our neighborhood cats have delivered 4 voles to my driveway in the last month. Maybe i need to stick to feeding the cats.I give it two starts just for the fact the unit was received in a well packaged box with very quick shipping."
1,Does not work,"Since I purchased this item, it seems to attract pest. I wish I could returned it. It was a waist of money."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,I had previously read the reviews and I chose to ignore them thinking that perhaps they were competitors/saboteurs etc. I wish I hadn't.Quite simply it did nothing but make another hole on the ground.I think the idea that this product would work makes sense but the technology is simply not there.Save your money.
1,complete waste of money.,"Like another poster mentioned, the mole actually seems to have an affinity for this junk. The day after I placed the rod in the soil, the mole dug a tunnel right next to it! I assume most of the positive posts are from people associated with this product."
5,so far it works like a charm,Purchased 1 to see if it worked. Installed 4 days ago and it's sent the ground mole 50 feet away. Back to purchase more to get them out of my gardens and lawn.
2,Sunforce 80001 life span too short.,"I bought two because I wanted to place them before going out of town. Both arrived on time in working order, but on my return two weeks later only one of them was still working."
1,Doesn't Work on Gophers,I had hoped this product would save me from having to put out traps. No luck. One of the younger gophers actually likes to sit on the thing when he suns himself.
1,didn't work for me,"In reading the reviews I guess this is just hit and miss. It seems to have worked for some people, but didn't work at all for me. I don't like the loud beeping noise, but I wouldn't mind it if it was repelling the squirrels, if anything I seem to have more of them. It was a waste of money for me."
3,Seems to work,Seems to work but it needs to be a little louder I think. But it seems to be working. I have a real problem with squirrels getting my tomatoes and pulling up stuff. I also trap them which helps. I use a have-a-heart trap so don't jump on me about being mean.
2,Questions,Ok I haven't seen any difference but it's only been a two days. I am wondering however is this thing suppose to vibrate? I hear the buzzing but I can't feel anything moving inside that might annoy the moles in my yard.
2,Not working for me,"We purchased two Sunforce Solar Pest Repellers to keep rats out of our garden and backyard. We live in an urban area and have children/pets so it seemed that this was a good investment. It would have been if it worked. Just last night, I saw a rat walk right by it without even flinching! It may work for gophers and moles but not ""rodents""."
3,I do not know if this works.,"There is still a gopher very near this repeller. Maybe I have to give it more time. It has been a month, so far."
2,WOW LOUD,in stalled in new laid sodded grass area still have gophers and way annoying with a beep every two minutes
1,Nuff said,I have tried every known method for getting rid of moles and this was the last step. I put in two and the moles came up right next to the device...waste of money.
4,I think it's working,"I think it is working since we don't have any new mounds, but (sh) my both of neighbors have new ones. So, I guess the moles have been tunneling elsewhere."
5,Super Soft and Great Fit!,"I've read of so many crib sheets shrinking after washing, so I was a bit worried when I registered for these sheets...especially since it was sight-unseen. Well, there was no reason to worry! Not only did they not shrink when washed (and they can be washed in warm and dried in the dryer!), but I was easily able to put 2 of them on the crib mattress to do the layering technique (layer of mattress pad, layer of sheet, layer of mattress pad, layer of sheet, to make it easier for middle of the night boo-boos that require a sheet change). And they're so soft, even after only 1 wash! Highly recommend, especially when you consider how they are less than half the cost of some of the other sheets at BRU that aren't anywhere near as soft or reliable."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought these sheets based on the excellent customer reviews. I have a standard-sized crib mattress and use a waterproof mattress pad under the sheet. Since day one I have struggled getting these sheets on. I've only had them for maybe four months, alternating use with another set of sheets and today when I went to put them on, they ripped.I understand that sheets need to be snug, but they shouldn't be so snug that you have to pull as hard as you can to get them on, eventually tearing them. I'm glad I only bought one set."
5,The best for my baby,"I bought one set for my son when he was born, but after using it once, I went out and bought two more sets. Now that his baby brother is on the way, I have bought a few more. These are the best sheets ever!! I wished I could rate these higher than a 5.I don't know if their best feature is the elastic band around the whole entire sheet or the comfort. They have a t-shirt like texture that makes me want to crawl in the crib myself and go to sleep. You cannot go wrong with these sheets. And, once you use them, you won't want anything else for your baby."
2,Not enough New Tunes........,"Don't buy this CD if you're thinking it has 14 new tracks...about half the CD has old tunes and out of the new tunes, only ""Better Learn"" is any good...This is coming from RedFlame of ""Redflame's Dancehall picks of the week""..."
5,REL GWAN GOOD,This record was rel good the first day it came out.. I would tell anybody that likes beenie to get it.. or just loves reaggae or any kind of music.. this will blow ya minds out..
3,Bad Man Nuh Flee --Tight,"4 me the album track is 06 === Bad Man Nuh Flee === Track is tight nuff I still blaze it more dun 6 times a day. No hiphop, no rnb, pure dancehall == if u like it original. The rest of the tracks well...buy it."
1,False advertising,"The product that was delivered was NOT a Terk cable, but rather a generic quad shield cable. This is the second time I have ordered what was advertised as Terk cable, but was not. Amazon should scrutinize their sellers better."
4,Nice jeans,"These are good looking and well made. Be aware, the size is a bit tighter than most. A great buy"
5,Simply delicious!,"I am extremely pleased with this book. A yoga instructor told me to check it out and I decided to buy it after reading the other review here. The recipes are well written and there is a lot of variey as well. So far, I have made the Louisiana Gumbo and the Southern Style Gravy with Sesame Biscuits - and both turned out amazing! I like the menu suggestions in the back and am anxious to try more of the recipes. If everything continues to turn out like the previous recipes, I may have a favorite new cookbook!"
3,Read it but not necessary to buy it.,"The issue is that we don't ask the right questions to understand a piece of information and form our independent opinion consistently.The conclusion is to form your own independent opinion by asking the following questions and evaluating the answers objectively:1. What are the issues and the conclusion?2. What are the reasons?3. What words or phrases are ambiguous?4. What are the value conflicts and assumptions?5. Are there any fallacies in the reasoning?6. How good is the evidence?7. Are there rival causes?8. Are the statistics deceptive?9. What significant information is omitted?10. What reasonable conclusions are possible?It is a good book because it gives a very good framework along with a lot of examples and practice work. There is also a companion website www.prenhall.com/browne.You need to get a copy of this from a library and practice the basic premise of the book. After that, you need to practice."
5,Excellent book for scientific researchers,"I believe that this book will have great impact on my research for Doctorial degree.One reason is this. In Chapter 9 ""How Good is the Evidence: Personal Observation, Research Studies, Case Examples, and Analogies?"", many problems with research findings are clearly explained. This makes me be wary of fallacies which might cause my research findings to become unreliable evidence, and result in poor research work."
3,Not at advertised,"This DVD is advertised to contain Andrew Robinson and several other actors, all of whom are in the 1988 TV movie Liberace, giving one the idea that it is indeed a DVD of that movie. However, this is NOT that movie. It is a compilation of Lee Liberace during several performances, the first in a series of DVDs of that same genra. I was indeed searching for the TV Movie on Amazon. I took a chance -- and lost."
1,Mystery Fans Save your Money!,There's NO murder in this book and no real mystery either. The whole thing is just a soap opera about her heroine's love life. It should be re-classified with the Harlequin romances. I'm not kidding. What a disappointment! Her other books were good. I want my money back.
5,Assorted cerial for the entire family,"My toddler likes one cereal, while I like a different more adult cereal and my husband likes a different inbetween cereal (go figure LOL). We are super busy during the week days and mornings are the craziest for us so this just came right in handy for us. :) It last a while too. I love that I can just pack my cereal and container of milk and go (because thats what usually ends up happening). Cereal is fresh and delishious and individually pacakged so no guess for those who are counting calories its all pre-measured out for you :D"
5,wonderful history for a general readership,"Don't believe the Mel Gibsons of the world, who think everyone who does not mindlessly echo their own beliefs is ""anti-Catholic"". This is a wonderful piece of history that both scholars and open-minded general readers will enjoy. I highly recommend it to those interested in the history of medicine and science as well as modern French culture and, of course, religion."
2,Not a Good Way to Learn Singhalese,"Right before my trip to Sri Lanka I purchased this book. I find the culture and language fascinating, but I was incredibly frustrated by my lack of understanding of Singhalese. Nearly every word in the Singhalese language is at least twice as long as any word in English.For a person w/ no previous experience w/ Singhalese this book will be too cursory to provide much benefit. I don't recommend taking it w/ you to Sri Lanka unless you have nothing else. On the other hand, it doesn't cost much, and is probably worth its price tag.When you're in Sri Lanka you might try to take some impromptu language lessons from a friendly stranger. You'll get more from it."
1,Not very useful,This little book is not very useful for learning such a complex language. There is nothing about the alphabet and the pronunciation guide is confusing.
4,"Enjoy the lessons, but...","I agree with most of the past reviews. Not enough new vocabulary words introduced into each lesson. The speakers speak very quickly, with limited time to formulate a respone. Be prepared to hit the pause button and rewind several times to catch everything.Written lessons to accompany the audio files would be nice. I spend alot of time on Google Translate creating my own workbooks for the audio lessons, and supplementing my vocabulary.I don't expect to ever become a fluent speaker based this system, but I think I could get along OK when we travel to Prague. That said, I think this is probably the best selt-taught product on the market for Czech. Without audio help it is a very difficult language to attempt.A level 2 and 3 would be very nice."
4,A great start,"It's a great beginning. I spend a ton of time in the car and the all audio program is very helpful. When using texts later it was much easier since the very basics were already familiar. This program is so much better than the standard 'travel phrases' CD's. I strongly recommend this good foundational program.However, we desperately need Czech 2 (the second 15 disc program)."
5,a good place to start,"Czech is a very difficult language to learn, even if you have studied other languages. If you have some basic knowledge of Czech or very little, this a good series to help you learn survival Czech. It doesn't require the ""brain-strain"" of too much memorizing. Yet this series is easy to work with and increases knowledge and confidence. I only wish that it had several levels beyond for the more serious student of ceski jasyk."
4,useful study of medieval history on film,"Aberth provides us an excellent survey of cinematic treatments of the medieval era. Each chapter opens with a survey of the history the films cover, tnen proceeds to discuss several key films. The chapters cover King Arthur films, Viking films, Crusade films, Robin Hood films, Black Death films, and Joan of Arc films. Aberth's judgments are pretty reliable, as he favors classic films such as Bergman's Seventh Seal and Dreyer's film on Joan of Arc, but he also finds value in newer films such as Navigator. A very worthwhile study by a historian of the middle ages."
1,Juvenile writing,No depth in author's writing - sounds as though she took actual events almost to the point of plagiarism and calls it writing a book without consideration for family or friends. Any juvenile writer could do as well. She should stick to her day job. Don't waste your money on this book. The Farmers Almanac is much better reading.
5,WONDERFUL!,I could not put this book down!LOVED it from start to finish andcan't wait for the sequel.How exciting; a new author with theability to paint word pictures thatleave many seasoned authors in her dust.Keep it up girl!
2,Sometimes you get what you pay for.,"We decided to go for an economical 4 head VCR and bought this unit. Unfortunately, it did not perform as well as we had hoped. The sound quality is the biggest drawback. The volume has to be turned way up to hear, but then we get a lot of back-ground noises(hissing..etc.) Other than that, there haven't been any other problems, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, even at such a low price. Sometimes you get what you pay for."
1,Not the whole story,"This book reflects the experiences of one woman, not of all military women. Many of the ""facts"" presented are personal opinion and are not corroborated by statistical documentation."
1,Don't bother!,"As a female soldier I was disgusted with this book! Not only are most of her claims false and extremely biased, but she didn't even try to back them up with facts. Probably becuase she knew she couldn't. Please don't read this book if your considering military service and if you do read this book, don't believe it!"
3,Better and better,"The Kinsey Millhone mysteries continue to improve as the series progresses. Grafton is dedicated to realism in her novels, and she focuses on the little details (grocery shopping, eating dinner, the barriers Kinsey faces) to create the proper perspective. In previous novels these details were a bit tedious, but Grafton finds a nice balance of day-to-day and suspense in 'D' is for Deadbeat."
5,D is for Darned Good,I read this book back in 1995 when I first discovered Sue. Decided to read it again.I had forgotten the story and characters so it was new to me. The murderer was a complete surprise. I hadn't a clue. The funeral scene was hilarious as other reviewers have said.Another great book by Sue and wonderful to read on a rainy Sunday afternoon which is what I did!
5,The third book in the series,"D is for Deadbeat is Sue Grafton's third book in the alphabet series. It is perhaps her best, though. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was reading the book. I really didn't want to put it down, but it was 15 minutes until I had to be at work.I even read on it all day and finished when I came home. It was a simply delightful and suspenseful book.The characters were selected for this story with the upmost care, and I was amazed at the believablility of the characters involved in the book. I was pleased that the author provided detail of not only the characters, but also the action, so that, like other mystery books out there, you end up getting confused because of not enough detail or too much. Not so in this book; everything was just right.Get this book; I know you won't be disappointed."
4,Good early Grafton book,Another good book by Sue Grafton. Good to read earlier book by this writer. Kinsey is fun to keep up with.
4,Mystery Genre,I have enjoyed all of Graftons books that I have read. Light reading - easily understood characters and plot. I don't want to read too many of them close together as they are formularic but they hold your attention.
4,Sue Grafton: always a winner!!,"Sue Grafton has the ability to keep you guessing! I love her humour!! Kinsey Millhone gets top marks in my book. From the moment one opens the book, it is un-put-downable...A definite must for any Alphabet-lover!"
3,WHICH BLONDE DID HIM IN???,"A fair read. Kinsey Millhone is given a $25,000.00 cashiers check to deliver to a 15 year old. A few days later the man that gave it to her turns up dead. The police believe he was drunk and fell in the water and drown but Kinsey belives he was murdered. She sets out to prove it. There are many good characters you met along the way. The funeral is fairly funny. Kinsely finally gets a witness who saw a blonde women with the man the night he died. But there are three different women it could be. You will be very surprised when the killer is found. The beginning and the ending were very good but I thought the middle of the book was slow moving."
3,Um...,"It's hard to enjoy a book when you're not rooting for the protagonist, and it's still harder to root for the protagonist when the protagonist is a potty-mouthed, dishonest, promiscuous head case. It is even harder to dismiss a protagonist as a potty-mouthed, dishonest, promiscuous head case when everyone else who reads the books thinks they're wonderful, and it's hardest to accept the fact that everyone else thinks they're wonderful when you know that it's probably because they're just like she is. The story was very good and occasionally theme-heavy, but I cheered at certain parts of the book and kept praying for Kinsey to die. Good books to read when you're angry."
3,Why the profanity?,"Okay, it had a good plot and an excellent ending. I will probably read more by this author. My question is ""Why the profanity?"" It was not necessary for the plot, the character or the overall essence of the book - It just sounded nasty and unnecessary."
5,Great story with a surprise ending.,"The alphabet detective is back and as good as ever. Grafton does a great job setting this mystery up and the ending is a complete surprise. The twists and turn in the book take you all over the place, where you end up is the one place you never would have figured. You will read this without putting the book down."
5,Serious fun!,"No one can make a funeral funnier than Kinsey. For that matter, I laughed till I wheezed over her description of the deadbeat's wife--a somewhat unstable Fundamentalist--and the picture taken on their 40th wedding anniversary. But the last chapter is a real nail-biter, as usual, and looking through Kinsey's eyes, these folks may be quirky, but human just the same. I've read all the books in the series, but this is the one I'd recommend to someone who hasn't read any of these books yet. What a sleuth"
5,Devious,Another page turner. I've not read one of her books that I didn't enjoy. Always an ending you're not expecting.
3,D is a C+,"There are no bad Grafton books but this one is not my favorite...a little hard to care about the outcome. However, the Kinsey Millhone character is always entetaining and real. Worth the read."
1,You'll never perform to these tracks,"This was one of the first CDs I got 15 years ago, when I first started dancing, and in all those years, I've never used a single track in performing or teaching. Same title, different cover photo (scantily clad woman on a flying carpet,)'Legacy' label. Listen to all the samples here and ask yourself if there is anything you'd actually want to perform to - the sound quality just is not good enough for modern audio equipment. These are field recordings, mostly of ethnographic interest.On the other hand, if you want background music for a scene where Indiana Jones goes into a dive in some small Egyptian town, this may be just what you're looking for.Beware of compilations by Arc, Laserlight, Legacy, and any other label that lists performers only as ""various."" Odds are good that you'll find the same old copyright-free tracks repackaged with a different dancer's photo on the cover."
4,"""Five star material--a little rushed toward the end""","Kudos to the author. This book kicks! Almost every aspect of ones life is covered in this book. I wonder if Michael Janke totally walks his talk? If he lives according to every concept in this book he can also walk on water! For anyone of any age looking to break out of the daily grind, this book is your guide. The last two sections in this book contained redundant quotes and obvious advise. This is the only reason I did not give this book a full five stars. I highly recommed this book, own it."
5,very much needed book,started reading this book at a time when I was a in a rut and needed a kick in the pants. reality check.
1,Figure out how to use this one.,"I'm pretty technical (OK, I'm a geek) but after nearly a year, I'm still tring to figure out how to use this phone. Poor design. No, very, very poor design. Looks good but that's about it.The battery won't stay charged. I bought a new one and only take the phone off the hook when talking (total talk time less that 1hr/week). Still have to switch phones during conversations.Don't buy this! It's junk."
3,Something wrong with the sound!,"I have this cd...and its rather quite good, but the sound is very low...i can't understand why...i think they recorded it too far away. Anyway this is the only other recording that has all 4 movements of the symphony, the other is on marco polo, which i prefer..because the sound is clear and close and i feel more involved in this truly tragic and contemplative work. The only other good thing about this disc is the notes, which have much more to offer than the notes in the marco polo recording.Its not a magical performance mind you, i'd imagine that the sawallisch recording with first 3 movements would be the one to get."
5,Masterpiece,"This book is as huge and beautiful as the world. If you haven't read it, you should. It teaches that life is so beautiful because it is transient ... and it does so in interesting ways. I have read this book over and over and I always love it just as much."
5,Every man should read this book!,"I'm not saying that a woman couldnt appreciate it, but it will do more for a man searching. The books dedication sums it all up ""For your father and mine and their journey exiled in us"" If you are familiar with Micheal Meade or Robert Bly and can appreciate the subject you need to read this book. It combines poetic writing, mystical wisdom and adventure. Buy every copy you come across."
3,still not sure about it...,I'm about 1/3 into this story and I'm really not sure about it. The beginning is very confusing with the forward and back mechanism and the introduction of three storyline characters. I'm hoping the action will pick up soon as it is not as much fun as I hoped it would be.
3,jamiemail@iname.com,Although this book took me five years to read (I gave up on it many times) I plan to give it another shot. Maybe it was worth it. I can't seem to get my mind off of Borneo.
5,Humble words are not enough to describe this masterpiece...,"An incredible epic adventure, involving cultural clash, piracy and buccaneering, mysticism and fantastic journeys into the psyche. Words are hard to find to descibe this book adequately. Undoubtedly one of the greatest adventures ever written with a horde of brilliant and fascinating characters, locations and situations to boot. It's a crime that this book is out of print, someone should really sort that out!"
1,Disappointment,"I recently purchased a copy of Cram 101 Textbook Outlines for ""Legal Aspects of Managing Technology, by Burgunder."" Frankly, $40.00 for a notebook and a glossary are an insult to readers. I intend to return the book for a refund."
2,Book is ok but kindle edition is pretty bad.,The file is almost unreadable on my kindle because it will not aallow me to enlarge the font. Reading it on a computer is ok but a pain in the butt.
4,Arrived quickly,I received on time but tons of highlighted text. Overall it was great - purchased for a class and sadly we only need 3 chapters out of it so I wont be able to review the overall quality of the book.
4,"Excellent, you'll probably not be able to put this book down","I know that Krentz follows a usual pattern in her novels, but this one was very excellent reading. Imogen is a smart woman, and where else could you find a woman who wears glasses and chases ""spectral phenomena""? It was a lot of fun to read! Archaelogy has never looked better, in my opinion, but where the heck is ""lost Zamar?"" Read it and see if you can figure it out!"
2,I am disappointed,"I read all Amanda Quick's novels. She is really a good writer for fun reading. However, this book is a bore. Amanda lost her touch here.I would not recommend her fans to read this book."
2,Mischief - Nothing new for fans of Amanda Quick,"I've read and enjoyed all of Amanda Quick's previous books but wassadly disappointed in this one. The characters and plot were sosimiliar to her previous books that I had no reason to finish readingthis one. If you're a first time reader and enjoy lightheartedromances, I would recommend this book. But as a longtime fan, Ifound this read was a bore."
5,great book,Excellent book. I really enjoyed it. I like most of her books. I will definitely buy more of her books I enjoy the Arcane Society books.
4,All around good read!,Mischief was no disappointment! I can always count on Amanda Quick for an entertaining read. Just wish she wrote as fast as I read!!
3,"No more Zamar, please.","A pretty decent plot to this story, but I had a hard time enjoying it because I was so distracted by ANCIENT ZAMAR. On every single page. Usually multiple times. The couple in this story share a love for the ancient civilization of Zamar, all things Zamarian, the statues of Anizamara and Zamaris, the tablets of Zamarian writings, Zamarian lovemaking techniques, and they love each other like they love ancient Zamar. Which is evidently a lot. And I hope to never hear the word Zamar again. Zamar...Zamar.....Zamar......"
3,Unmemorable,I gave it 3 stars because it truly was unmemorable. I had to read the book overview and a few reviews to jog my memory. I have no problem remembering books/audios that I enjoy. I normally enjoy Amanda Quick books....and remember them. :-)
5,A Strong Woman Meets Her Match,"One of the great things about the women Amanda Quick writes about is the fact that they are strong and stubborn. This story is no exception. Imogen Waterstone needs a man to pretend to be attracted to her so that she can draw out an enemy. What she didn't bargain for was the passion that would erupt between herself and the Earl of Colchester that she recruits. Instead of solving a mystery, she finds herself also falling in love. Mixing the two can bring about so many complications that are passionate and even funny.This was a great read that I actually read twice. A great book for those that love romance and mystery."
3,Par for the course...,"The good thing about Amanda Quick's (pseudonym of Jayne Ann Krentz) regency romances is that they're consistent. You know before you even open the book what the gist of it will be about, and that it'll be a decent or better read. That's also the bad thing about Quick's books - they're so consistent that they all start sounding alike after a while. Just change the names, alter a few of the details, and there you have it. She has such a good way with pacing, quirky characters, and witty dialogue, however, that it makes you overlook some of the repetitiveness. Even knowing what I'll get, I still reach for her books from time to time when I haven't read her for a while. This particular title isn't one of her better ones - the tension and relationship between the hero and heroine isn't as well done as her other books - so it gets an ok (3) rating overall."
1,this phone [stinks]!,"I'm writing this review to warn people not to buy this phone! I swear the one I got is possessed! It has really bad noise problems, it answers after 1 ring even though I have it set to answer after 5, when I have the answering machine part off because it answers after the first ring it turns it's self on anyways. I can't stand this phone and will never ever buy a bell south phone again!!"
1,I hate this phone,"I can't stand this phone! The volume level cannot be adjusted... much. And the calls are WAY TOO loud. When I get a buzz to let me know someone is trying to reach me while I'm on the other line, it's so loud it makes my ears ring. It's painful. And I have it set on low (you can only set it to low, medium and high... nothing in between). After using the phone for about a month (I got good at holding it away from my ear), the calls now are too low to hear. The call intereupt noise is still painfully loud, but the voice on the other end of the line is almost too low to hear. Also, when I receive a call, about 1 in 4 times the handset doesn't pick up... instead it makes an awful screeching sound right in my ear... I absolutly despise this phone. Today my 11-month-old daughter tossed it into the dog's water dish... and killed it. I'm so happy."
2,Hard to use,"This phone has useful features and good sound quality (except message playback on the answering machine), but is very hard to use. The button combinations you must push to do simple things like add a number to the phone memory or call a number from the caller ID list baffle me, and I am quite a tech savvy person. I am returning this phone because the display stopped working one day after I set it up, not to mention it's complete user-unfriendliness."
1,it does not come with tools !,This product only comes with the barrel you have to buy the pump to get the water out . I ordered 2 barrels and one of them was missing a cap. On day two of my trip the pump stopped working and I could not get any water out of the barrel!!!!!The company sent me a cap right away and charged me for the pump. I feel the picture is misleading because to me I thought the pump came with the barrel and it almost looks like it is attached to the barrel in the picture. I guess it doesn't matter if you have the pump or not because it doesn't work (or at least the one that was sent to me did not work)! I still have not been mailed an invoice for the pump and it has been over 2 months. The staff I spoke with was hard to get ahold of at first but they were very friendly once I contacted them.
1,Disappointed,"I'd love to review this magazine - If it would ever get mailed to me! I ordered it months ago, and am still waiting for it to arrive."
4,Aesthetic and Functional,"Luckily for me, the previous owner of the house had a pot rack, so the hook was already in place for immediate placement of the rack to hang from the ceiling. Since I have a high kitchen ceiling, I got some additional chainlink so it would hang down low enough, and voila, it was up and holding 8 pans/pots. I only needed the 8 hooks that go along the perimeter, but they include some additional S-hooks which I haven't used. I have no complaints - it does what it's supposed to do."
4,Into Left Eye's World,"Overall I think this is a good album. There are a lot of songs I like and I thinkg its just very interesting to hear what she has to say. I think all TLC/Left Eye fans should get this CD. There are just a couple of songs on there that I tend to skip over, but other than that I think its a cool album."
5,R.I.P. Left Eye,"Man this was good Lisa proved she can well could hold her own without t boz or chili. Lisa gets deep my favorites are true confessions where her boyfriend ask her to get intimate with another woman, and untouchable which features 2pac kinda spooky hearing this since both are dead. R.I.P. left eye you was fire.why do they all gotta go so soon and she had so mucj talent to give us a tragedy. she will be missed."
2,Somewhat disappointed.,"I bought this album a few months ago- didn't even know it existed until recently. I was a fan of Lisa Lopes back in the day, and always thought she should do her own project, so when I found out about Supernova I ordered it immediately. I hate to say it, but it was not that impressive. Tracks 1-4 were pretty much all I listened to, but this cd did not contain any hits.I think what I didn't like about it is that it sounds like she is at a poetry reading or something. Her raps were not as hard hitting or catchy as I remember during her time with TLC, so it was quite strange. I do not recommend Supernova unless you are a hardcore fan who enjoys poetry readings."
2,Pure Trash,"I Heard About This CD From Friends At School. I Was Getting It For Him For A Present, I Listened To It, Wow, This Music Is [junk]. I Usually Like ""Punk"" Like Rancid, Anti-Flag, Tossers, Etc. But This Is Trash, They Sound Like A Mix Between Slayer And Rancid Backround. This Isn't The Kind Of Music I Would Listen To For Over 5 Mins. I Had To Stop It Short. I'm Sorry, The Only Thing I Really Enjoyed Was The Back Guitar And Drums."
1,the worst street rock band -ever,"this os a horrible band with false messages and no talent. street punk has never been as good as oi!, crust, or '77 punk, but you gt to know what to look for. try the skeptix, RIoT SQuAD if you like street punk. not this crap or any other punkcore band excpt the lower class brats"
1,not good,"This isn't a good cd. I cant even understand the lead singer. Fashion punk is stupid. I can't believe i liked these guys at one point, now i just think they're horrible."
1,horrible,"this is the most repeititive crap ever, it's the same note and same speed the whole way through, i have the vinyl and if you want to scratch on it you don't even need to know where it is, because you'll produce the same key scratch on any moment of this album, repeitition is cool if it's good in the first place, this, is Not!"
3,Good But Not Great,"The Casualties are a good band. A GOOD band. Not the punk kings that everybody makes them out to be. Songs like ""Nightmare"" and ""No Turning Back"" are anthems. But that's what hurts this cd to me. Some of these songs seem to try too hard to convince us how hard these guys are. It's like a punk version of rap almost. And I know that punk vocalist usually can't sing but his voice gets annoying. But besides those quirks, this is a decent album. It's worth checking out."
4,Book Description,"An abandoned attempt at suicide has caused nineteen-year old Taryn Martin to rethink her life and her values. The possible murder of his sister, an end to a drug addiction, and a reputation as ""the human lie detector"" because of his supernatural ""gift"" has caused Conner Patience John Rodriguez to start a new life in Belleview. Soon, Taryn and Conner's paths cross. But unknown to either, the college town of Belleview has a dark secret: a secret that will test the strengths and the fears of anyone who knows about it."
2,skip it,"In addition to the 'deification' of Robert Parker, noted by another reviewer, the book shows a surprising level of ugly American. Given the author's history, I had expected better. When I reached the bit where the author tsked 'those bad frenchies' who 'forgot we saved their bacon in WWII', I gave up. The subject matter the author follows could have made a good book, but in the end did not."
3,Diefication of Robert Parker?,"Speaking as a California wine maker from a region ignored by Robert Parker (the Sierra foothills) I found the deification of Mssr. Parker somewhat tedious. There were also some editing or reporting inconsistencies that made me wonder about other assertions made in the book. On page 37 Parker is said to get a good 10 hours sleep a night yet his assistant Pierre-Antoine Rovani claims he works 18 hours a day. Perhaps I am quibbling, but details such as these make me wonder if there are other errors I am not noticing.As to the non-Parker portions of the book; the stories were entertaining, gossipy and trashy. In other words thouroughly enjoyable."
4,A vine read,"This book is a good 'slice of time' account of the Bordeaux region of France. The author manages to include lots of history and geography, as back story, interwoven with interesting stories of real people and estates. I do have to echo another reviewer's sentiment- it can be very confusing at times. I kept having to go back and re-read to keep the people and their roles straight. This book is a great companion to the documentary MONDOVINO. Many of the people and places featured in the book are in the movie."
5,Bye Dawn!,"Dawn starts to miss her father, brother and friends in California so she decides to move back for six months. But she starts to worry that no one would miss her. This book is really funny. Especially the non-Dawn parts. I was laughing so hard that I was crying!"
4,Dawn isn't a brat!,Though many people say Dawn's a big brat I don't think she is. In this book Dawn goes back to California for 6 months.Though her decision was tough on everyone she had to do what was right for her.I do though think that Dawn should make up her mind. Since sheoes back to Stoneybrook and then back to California again in Faerwell Dawn.Make up your mind Dawn!
2,"Big on emotionalism, small on facts","Since there is no such thing as ""Satan,"" the very title of this book ""threw me off"" when browsing the book store, but since it was in the ""bargan bin,"" I felt it was wortyh two dollars to read. Now that I've read it, I want my two dollars back--- it was not worth it.It is well and good to relate anecdotal information if it is then supported by good data; the author does not bother doing this. It is also okay to add emotionalism to retain the reader's interest =IF= it is then followed with reasoned, sensible facts and information--- which the author also has not done.All in all, a waste of time. Please consider reading a different book."
1,Dangerous minds still in dark places,"Having read the book and met with the author's, I found the book slim on facts and overall lacking merit in self help. Whereas, I am sure they were part of a group that should be investigated, the authors are as extreme. Self help and improvement books take a solid and inner tone of problem recognition and ways moving from dark problem places to everyday life. Both the authors and the book think they have pin pointed a problem and have moved into the mainstream. In point of fact, both the book and authors are still in a very dark place and are seeking revenge more then anything else."
1,It serves its job well....,If you are looking for a fondue pot.... This is it. It does its job the way its suppose to.
2,Works Great if You Can Get Over the Flawed Design,"The good news: This fondue pot heats up very quickly, gets very hot and the non-stick surface is truely non-stick. My issues are with the design: the plug should be called ""sure it's plugged in?"" instead of ""sure release."" It wouldn't stay plugged in; the slightest nudge and it'd come unplugged from the pot. There's two prongs but it seems to only stay together via the magnet in the plug. Also, I don't like that the temperature control is blocked by a handle. It seems like an obvious mistake to place them like that. This fondue pot works well but because of the plug and the knob location we'll be returning ours for a different brand."
4,$20 at Target.com this week! (1/31/2005),"Just to alert prospective buyers, this item is $20 on sale at Target.com the week of 1/31/2005. We had just purchased this about 10 days ago at the $29.99 price. Amazon.com would not give us a price match at the Target.com sale price. Why Target@Amazon.com and Target.com prices are not the same would be best answerd by the two database administrators.Other than that, this is a good fondue pot at $29.99, and an even better one at $20. Easy to clean. Happy Fonduing!"
4,Great for parties!,"We bought our Rival Fondue Pot after a wounderful trip to the Melting Pot and decided to creat our own fondue at home. We love using and showing off our Rival Foundue Pot, it looks sleek and comes with enough skews for company. The electric option allows you to controld the heat which makes it sfae to cook anything (cheese, chocolate, and even meet). It is a little difficult to clean because it is not dishwasher safe and can not be submurged into water. It was a good price and we enjoy using our foundue pot."
2,Way too hot,"This pot does not work for me. Even on the lowest setting my cheese fondue bubbles... NOT GOOD. The breakaway cord is way to short. It might work ok if you want to cook meats or vegetables, but not for keeping cheese or chocolate fondue at the right temperature. Gave mine to Goodwill. I'll get an old fashioned pot with sterno flame next time."
2,Doesn't get as hot as it should,"At first I thought this was a great product. If you only make cheese fondue it is great. The pot is very easy to clean although it could be easier if it were dishwasher safe.The problem I've had with mine is that it doesn't get beyond about 320 degrees. The dial goes up to 400 but even after waiting for 30 minutes for it to heat up, it only got up to 323 degrees and wouldn't go any further. So if you want to use this for oil for a steak fondue it won't do the job well.I know these kinds of appliances have to have a short cord and also a break-away cord but this is ridiculous. Touch the darn thing and the cord falls free. Very frustrating if you have a lot of people trying to use it for fondue. People kept telling me that the cheese was getting ""hard"" because the cord had fallen off, again. Next time I'd get a pot that had a thermometer built in, don't rely on the heat setting dial."
5,A++++,"This is the perfect little pot for entertaining or for keeping the kids entertained (with supervision, of course). It's easy to create lots of possibilities and a snap to clean up. I love that I don't have to transfer from another pot. Cheese melts quickly and stays perfectly warm. The recipes included are great. I highly recommend this A++++ fondue pot."
2,Looks and Sounds Home-Made,"I received this cd, which I had hoped would finally complete my Naxos collection of the organ works of Marcel Dupre. Unfortunately, the liner notes are not included, and the sound quality of the disc is a bit harsh and disappointing. If I get another home-made Naxos disc instead of the properly made ones to which I've become accustomed, I'll stop ordering them."
4,Power of AFrican Cultures,"An appropriate read for undergraduate or graduate students in African or African-American Studies. The author provides a perspective from a West African bias, which adds texture to the many English language scholarly texts with a British or American bias."
2,Too Opinion Based,"This book was required reading for a class I took on African Culture and Development. I did not find this book helpful. Falola inserts their opinion far too often into this book. This should not be considered and textbook, it is a person's opinion of the development of African. This book was painful to read."
5,Song Listing,"This is NOT a CD single. This is the song listing: 1. Fairest Lord Jesus / My Jesus, I Love Thee / I Love You (6:31) 2. Just As I Am / Father, I Adore You / Have Thine Way, Lord / Lord Be Glorified (4:54) 3. O God Our Help in Ages Past / To Every Generation (4:52) 4. Blessed Assurance / He Is Able / I Will Celebrate (5:27) 5. It Is Well With My Soul / In His Time / Cares Chorus (5:18) 6. Were you there? / Blessing, Honour and Glory / Lord, Lift Your Name on High (6:23) 7. Softly and Tenderly Jesus is Calling / I Need You / I Thank You (6:55)"
2,Unoriginal,"Like material been done, and better, elsewhere. In spite of the lack of originality, reading inspirational material can be uplifting, and if that's what you want, this book is for you. Part of my disappointment comes from mistaking the book for a book about energy healing, (it is not) some of which have similar titles, through no fault of the author. Please see other reader's reviews."
4,Great CD,great cd...looked all over for it in digital format but to no avail. found it here brand new and my wife love's it.
5,Vanguard VT-560 Tripod,For the money that I payed. It actually works better than some of my expensive ones. The handel on the side works really well when you are in a hurry.....
5,Oswald could NOT have been convicted based on the evidence,"Assumptions are made and some slight liberties are taken. However, Walt Brown examines the evidence and allows the reader to see how it was not only impossible to have convited Oswald, but also how it would have been impossible for virtually anyone to have committed the crime with that weapon. READ IT."
1,Three Tenors review,"This DVD was recommended by my brother, age 62, and not exactly a ""culture vulture."" I really enjoy Andrea Bocelli so I thought I would like this DVD. Let me just say if you really are not into a bunch of guys singing in Italian you may want to got to the library and check this one out before buying it.Interesting note: The album cover for ""Three Tenors"" has photographs of four men."
5,"Fantastic Video, great sound.",This is a title I listen to over and over again. I feel like I'm in Dodger Stadium. The only way to listen is with 5.1 sound system. The sound is awesome. My favorite music DVD!!!! and let them get that many people into Dodger stadium for a baseball game!
5,No better than this,"This is the Three Tenors at the top of their form, and in a beautiful locale. The selected music, arias, are well known and among the most melodic in opera.In addition the setting is hard to beat for a sense of history--the baths at Caracalla, in Rome.The photography is also very good, with frequent sweeping views of the immense audience that was present. The tenors of course have aged with time--Pavarotti is no longer with us, Placido Domingo has moved on to occasional conducting, and Carerras I do not know about. Their format has since been copied many times by other trios, but this recording of the first performance of its type in the form of classical opera remains as the exemplar."
5,sword fight,This movie has the best sword fight ever staged.I saw it years ago on T.V. and I never forgot it.The price of the video is worth it just for the sword fight.
3,Prince Valiant,"Robert Wagner's performance in this story is very weak and forced, one could even say ""sappy."" This could have been a classic movie, but there's a reason you probably didn't know a movie version of this classic story existed--there are very poor elements to this movie. James Mason is strong as usual, but Janet Leigh's performance is also weaker than any film I've ever seen her in. The cinematography is good. I can only guess that it must have been a poor directing job to get such contrived performances from two of the main actors. If you like well acted classic movies, you'll probably be disappointed in this one. I was."
2,Disappointment,"As a great fan of the Prince Valiant comic strip, I was eager tosee this film. If only the producers had spent as much on writers and research as they spent on locations and photography they might have had something other than camp. You will get to see Stirling Hayden before he learned to act and Vikings out of a parody of Wagnerian opera. If you want sword-play, plot and real acting, with authenticity and stunning scenery watch ""The Vikings""."
1,So So,"I love the King Arthur Era movies, but was not thrilled with this one. I found it to be a bit slow, and the characters were not very engaging.There are plenty of other movies like this that are much more enjoyable"
1,Prince Valiant,So Sorry I could not watch this movies as It had code error regent I hope I can get it later to watch this as I like robert wagner thank you.
3,A mixed bag,"Prince Valiant is a reminder of movie making of the 1950s, both its strengths and (at least perceived) weaknesses. Filmed in rich color, the story is one a child of those times now in his sixties can understand why he enjoyed it enough then to go to the theater four times (a large number of visits back then) to watch Valiant succeed against the Black Knight. It still has the action and large-horn helmeted Vikings to enchant the child that remains in a person of those times. But the film also seems to indicate that its intent was also part of a message in favor of the blacklisting and witch hunts of those times, as it repeatedly makes reference to Christians against heathens. At the same time, such battles were going on in Europe around the time of King Arthur, certainly they were a part of the literature of the times of early Arthurian legend. Maybe that's all there is to it and nothing more."
2,Entertaining,"This is one of the funniest films I have seen in...well...it's not really that funny, but it's something good to watch when you have nothing to do one afternoon especially if you're one of those people who are too lazy to change the channel and have no life. Especially if you're a filmmaker, it's good for your self-esteem. It's one of those movies that are good at two in the morning when everything is funny especially the tasteless hair styles and corney acting. Perfect movie for aspiring actors who want to know what not to have on their resume."
4,VALIANT VIDEO,I AM AN OLD MOVIE BUFF AND THIS MOVIE I SAW YEARS AGO BUT I STILL ENJOY IT NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. ITS GREAT TO SEE THE ACTORS SO YOUNG THEN ANDTHE VIDEO IS IN GREAT SHAPE
5,Excellent and fun movie for families! Our kids love it! :),"We have really enjoyed watching this together as a family - there's something for everyone from princesses to a prince to even the bad guy in King Arthur's Court. It is what it is - a fun family movie that capture children's imaginations and we parents don't have to worry about foul language. Sure wish the ""new"" hollywood would make fun, clean movies keeping wholesome family viewing in mind! That is the reason we love this movie - kid's don't need the sleekness and side, mature jokes that come out in current movies - this movie is fun and great to watch - highly recommend it! =-)5 Stars!!! for family viewing!!!"
4,Great movie from my childhood,"I have always been a huge fan of this movie since I first saw it on its original release in the 50's. I realize this makes me ancient, but what can I say. The cast is great if you overlook Sterling Hayden's lack of accent and the sword which is so large as to defy a fight as long as the final fight between Robert Wagner and James Mason. These things don't really take away from the movie, which remains one of my favorites."
5,Prince Valiant,The storyline was typical for the time that the movie was made but overall it was a nice film.The video was received in a timely manner and in excellent condition.
4,PRINCE VALIANT,"Robert Wagner stars as a young Scandian prince in exile whose quest to win back his father's throne leads him to King Arthur's court and the arms of beautiful Princess Aleta in this extremely well-made and enchanting 1954 adaptation of the famous comic strip character. A delightful mix of adventure, comedy, romance, and royal intrigue, Prince Valiant is brought to life by a marvelous cast (Wagner as the titular young knight; Janet Leigh as his lady Aleta; James Mason as the traitorous Black Knight; and Sterling Hayden as Val's mentor, Sir Gawain) from a heady script by Dudley Nichols and the exhuberant direction of Henry Hathaway. Non-stop fun right up to the amazing trial by combat at the end (one of the best sword fights ever filmed), Prince Valiant is a first class family film that everyone can enjoy."
3,"Great fun and very enjoyable. Not serious, but so what?","I watched this movie fearing the worst, since it was derived from a comic strip character. Never fear--this is good entertainment. While this is not a film to take seriously, it is a fun excursion into the ""King Arthur"" theme and does avoid being straight slapstick. For those not familiar with it, ""Prince Valiant"" is the story of a Scandanavian prince whose father has been dethroned, who comes to King Arthur's court with the ambition of becoming a knight of the Round Table and restoring his father's kingship.This film features an unusually good cast for a production of this type and caliber. Robert Wagner as Val, Sterling Hayden (of ""Dr. Strangelove"" fame) as Sir Gawain, James Mason as the Black Knight, and Janet Leigh as Princess Aleta all turn in very enjoyable performances. The swordfight at the end (no spoilers here) is great!This is an excellent movie to watch with young kids, and adults will enjoy it too."
4,A beautiful live recording,"There are some fantastic live songs on this album, and although I believe Heather Nova is the finest female singer/songwriter in the world, I felt some of these performances were not as strong as those found on past live albums such as ""Blow"". That said however, the second half of the album, from 'Not Only Human' onwards, is just amazing. 'I'm The Girl' and 'Sugar' are better here than I have ever heard. I can't get over how stunning Heather sounds live. She is truly gifted."
4,"Good, inexpensive, SKINNY tire.","As other reviewers said, this tire appears very skinny when on the bike. On a hardtail mountain bike this will not provide much ""cush"" over rough terrain. However, I was putting this tire on my wife's bike, and she is small and lightweight and so is her bike. For her, efficiency is important (as well as cost) so this skinny tire is a great choice for her bike.It gives good grip and is a great price. Can't ask for much more than that."
5,Good Deal,"Saw these tires on another website with high reviews and recommendations. Surprised they are so cheap. Great buy, does the job and grips the road good."
5,Great Deal,This tire is a Kenda-K850. It has nice tread and a steal for a little over $7.00. GREAT DEAL!!!
2,The Budget DVD Bugaboo Strikes Again,"""Tumbleweeds"" is a film very worth having, but alas, my copy of the Miracle(tm) ""Tumbleweeds/Yellowstone"" disc froze and/or shattered into pixels by the third minute of ""Tumbleweeds"", rendering the disc unwatchable. With budget discs, you never know what you'll get -- the previous reviewer was pleased with his copy. Mine was unusable. Yours? Who knows? Is a bargain a bargain if you can't actually use it?Get the restored version from Image Entertainment instead -- it costs a lot more, but it looks better (and plays dependably) which suggests that if you have more than a very casual interest in ""Tumbleweeds"", it'll be well worth your cash."
2,"God is great, this movie isnt.","This movie is advertized as a comedy, but there's nothing funny about it. It's long, and a pure melodrama. I was totally disappointed"
1,I couldn't finish watching it.,"It looks like it might be a decent movie, but the camera work; constant starting and stopping, jiggling of the camera and odd angles was giving me motion sickness and I couldn't concentrate on the story. I gave up about 15 minutes in. It was just annoying more than anything. There are much better films with this actress it them."
2,Dissapointing!,"I am sorry to break this to you guys but this was pretty dissapointing. The best parts were the fencing which was tame, to say the least. Yet if you like a more dramatic film than one filled with action this may be your thing. The acting was reasonable and the plot hard to understand unless you understand the history, morals, society and conflicts of Eastern Germany! MR L should stick to the ACTION films!"
2,Not worth its weight in gold,"I purchased this watch and liked the fact it was an everyday watch. I has a classic looked but, the band would NEVER stay closed, so i had to return the watch. If they improved the band, a clasp that stays closed it would be great. I have very small wrist and the length the bracelet was perfect for me, only a little loose with all of the links in. My wrist measures 6 1/2 inches. And seeing that I have small wrist it is difficult for me to find watches that do not swallow my wrist and have a decent sized face, and look more professional than feminine. So when I tried on the watch I thought I struck gold, it wasn't too big, not too heavy, and the perfect size face.Again, if it had not been for the flimsy clasp that would not stay closed I would still be wearing the watch today."
4,Twilight Circus Dub Sound System - 'Horsie' (M Records),"Good, but I for one liked the 'Dub Plate Selection' effort (see my review) a bit more. Tunes here that manage to stand on their own are the somewhat jazz-fused title track ""Horsie"", ""Ergmm"" which is a nice little electronic space rock piece, ""Carousel"" and the industrial ""Binshaker Dub"". Do keep in mind that on every Twilight Circus Dub Sound System CD, the entire disc is essentially a true Ryan Moore solo work."
3,Good but not waterproof,"I have worn these boot for about 6 months. I use them for walking to/from work, ~ 5 miles/day. They are light weight & Flexible. Love those features. After 5 months, the seams started leaking just when walking in heavy dew, ~ 2 miles. Most of my toes & about 2"" back were wet. I tried waterproofing them with silicone spray, but it made no difference.These boots are great, except for the leaking."
2,"Nice boot, but too short, runs small.","I always wanted Keen boots, but all seem to be too short from back to front. Larger sizes of this boot were way too wide, but still too short. It is better to try on at the store."
4,Question the Source,"Love Keens, have owned them for years. Thought I would try to find some online ""less"" expensive than a retail store. Paid about 25.00 less for these, when they arrived was thrilled. (They were a requested gift) After the first wear, the complaint came that there was something around the pinkie toe that made one shoe hurt, when I checked it, there was a huge bunch of fabric where the inside was sewn into the shoe RIGHT WHERE THE PINKIE TOE GOES. I wanted to return them but the giftie said no and suffered with the pain, until I cut out the spot. That tells me they were seconds, and not sellable in the retail market, which is why I got the $ discount. Won't do it again, I looked like a fool. First and last time for this online purchase. I hate purchasing things to wear online, as my success rate is 30% at best, so I won't do this again either."
4,"Quality is Great, sizes run small.","I ordered size 12, and they were not long enough. 13s were too big. Too bad they don't make 12.5. I ended up going with size 12 Pittsburg soft toe, which were long enough."
3,"Not waterproof, but comfortable.","These shoes might be a little water resistant, but that's the best thing I can say about them. I wear them at work where the floor is always wet but the water is never higher than 1/2 an inch; I still come home with damp feet. They are comfortable, though. And they are better than shoes that aren't water resistant."
3,Keen Men's Targhee II Mid,"This is the second pair of shoes in this style that I have owned. My last pair fell a part in a few weeks, but that is because they aren't a good outdoor rugged boot (at least for central Australia they couldn't cut it!!!). The sole started to delaminate about 3wks into owning them and my gaiters wore through the material around the top. So why did I buy another pair?? Because they are probably one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have tried on. I have wide feet and these would have to be one of the widest makes. This pair will be my 'urban hiker' which will be worn around the streets and some light 'tracked' bushwalking with no extra weight carried."
2,Duct tape and bubble gum,"Had the sole coming apart after 155 miles of trail. Used super glue to hold them together for another section of the AT. Keen, you gotta be kidding me! Everything else about the boot is fine, but to lose it's basic function on account of glue? Just stupid!"
3,comfortable but soon breaks,"These are the most comfortable walking boots I've ever worn. However, the laces cut through the straps through which they're threaded. When this happened to my first pair, I bought another pair and installed thicker laces, thinking they wouldn't cut the straps - to no avail, the thicker laces also cut the straps.All was not lost. The shoe repair shop installed grommets. They look kinda dumpy but nobody noticed during my trek through Russia and China."
1,Comfortable but lethal in the wet,"I found these boots to be extremely comfortable straight out of the box. Bought them for a honeymoon trip to NZ and needed something that would tackle all terrain.Problem came on day two in the wet, quite honestly leather soles would have been more useful. They have NO grip in the wet whatsoever and both my wife and I fell several times just walking on a pavement (sidewalk) It was not as though we were climbing a mountain !They are so dangerous in the wet that I have to suggest that people utterly avoid these shoes, I have the bruises all over my legs and arms to prove how bad they are. If I can find a replacement, these are going in the trash"
4,Love Keens BUT,"No wide widths :(. I've had the same exact model but in women's. I got men's this time b/c I need a wide and couldn't find a wide in women's. Years ago I was told they don't make them in wide. A men's medium is typically a D width (women's is B), but these are still snug on the sides of my feet. I guess I need at least an E width. Since the waterproof model is more rigid, there's not a lot of give, so if you have a wider foot get a half size bigger than you normally need.Even so, I've always loved Keens and this was a great deal for this model at $90, when it normally runs about $130. Other than that these are super durable, comfy, super waterproof, great boots. I am very hard on shoes, work outdoors, do a ton of walking in all weather. I was very impressed with my last pair, other than being too narrow. The old pair is still in great shape other than being warped from wear; nothing pulled apart! For me that's amazing for having them for 3+ years."
5,Very happy with these hiking boots,"Tried on 10-15 different hiking boots before I decided on these. I have a wide foot, and most boots were too tight in the front with even a fairly thin wool hiking sock. These Keens have a very wide toe box and fit the best. I took a hike in the park/woods today in 20 degree weather with 4 inches of snow, and my feet stayed warm and dry in these Keens. No complaints at all about them."
4,Order size up,This has been a great boot. Very comfortable and has stayed water proof and together for the last year. I have worn this boot almost daily. But do order a half size larger than normal they run a little small.
5,Man oh Man.....,"I saw the shoe and liked the look so I asked for my size. When the sales assistant brought it out I quickly laced them up and put them on. I was blown away. When the sales rep returned and asked how they were I said ""These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn"" and that was no exaggeration. He went on to mention that they build their shoes not based on shoe size but on arch length. I don't know what that means in terms of the science of how the foot operates but they seem to be onto something. This is a comfy well made shoe it's functionality will be put to the test out on the trail."
5,very nice boot,This boot is super comfortable. Also is quite warm for winter use. I haven't been hiking with it yet but using it for everyday all day use around the house and around town in winter weather. Be sure to order 1/2 size larger than your regular size..
4,Feels great from day one,"The first pair of Keen shoes I tried were a size 7 (second hand) I got them wet a few times, they kept my feet dry but the shoes seemed to shrink a bit. So for my second pair I bought size 7 and for this pair I decided to go for size 8. I'm 64 and my feet are getting longer,I guess. I've read reviews saying that with Keen shoes you should order a larger size than other shoes, I guess that's true. I wear them everyday and work outside with them so they take a beating and get wet so sometimes parts of the sole come unglued.For these shoes I have to say they felt great from day one. No breaking in period. I'll see how long they last."
5,Love them,"Well this is my second pair of Keen's and the quality is great on them, they fit to size and as another reviewer stated like a four wheel drive for your feet. Do yourself a favor and give them a try."
4,leighton72,"Have had a few pairs of hiking boots before (very expensive)none of them compare to the comfort of these boots !Had them on for 10 days solid on a recent trip , driving, hiking ,fishing even just kicking around, not sooo much as a rub mark ...awesome boot,want to get steel cap pair for work....ps also rained for 7days ,did'nt feel a drop ..."
5,Great hikers!,"I have worn Keen Targhees casually and for hiking for nearly two years. We have been hiking in the heat, cold, dry weather, and wet weather and my Keens have performed wonderfully. They are light, water resistance, and hold the trail well. My feet have never been wet, as long as the water or snow did not come over the top of the shoe. The soles have worn exceedingly well for the terrain they have been exposed to. The insole supports my feet well and accomdates an arch support with no problem. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants comfort and durability."
1,"Fine for Pavement, Not for Trails","These boots are comfortable and lightweight, however they are not waterproof. If you are hiking off pavement avoid these boots.Walking 15 minutes in heavy dew resulted in soaked socks in both my boots. I was actually able to ring water out of my socks! For the rest of the day I had to put up with wet feet which certainly detracted from my hiking experience.I would strongly recommend against purchasing these boots if you plan to do any hiking especially in the back country."
3,Disappointed,"When I first found these boots I was so pleased with the comfort and wider toe box. I had never tried on Keens before. I bought these boots, and I hike daily in the mountains near my home, and the cushioning and comfort were great. Unfortunately, within two months the darker rubber part of the soles began separating from the main sole, so I took them back. I do have two other pairs of Keens that I love, though it would be nice to have hiking boots with the comfort of Keens that would last."
4,Sweet Show,"Saw the broadway cast a couple days before opening and thought it was a sweet, warm hearted musical that would have played better off-broadway in a smaller venue. Have seen it several times since on smaller stages and was right. Much better as an intimate show than on a large broadway stage. Still, has a delightfully charming score, hits the nail on the head about fears of childbirth. Liz Callaway is wonderful. She should have become bigger on the NY stage. Very enjoyable CD."
3,Tender to the point of being sappy,"I bought this to help out with music direction for a college production, and I really wanted to love it. It seems, lyrically and musically, to want to be moving but end up being saccharine. Also an unpleasant surprise are the Jonathan Tunick orchestrations. His work on all the 1970s Sondheim shows and Maury Yeston's Broadway shows (and Michael John LaChiusa, for that matter) is unparraleled, so his work here is a letdown. But, perhaps when he was faced with such an uneventful score, he felt the need to dress it up as much as possible."
3,Closer than never.,"This isn't BIG.This isn't CLOSER THAN EVER.This certainly isn't STARTING HERE, STARTING NOW.Liz Callaway soars. Although the ballads are nice (especially 'The Story Goes On'), songs like 'Patterns' and the woman that performs them just break my ears. This certainly isn't the Maltby and Shire I was expecting.But, hey, it's up to you."
5,BEYOND GREAT,"My dad has had captain beefheart records playing around me ever since I remember. A couple of months ago, he put this one in the car stereo. I could remember hearing all of these songs on vinyl for as long as I could remember. One day driving with my friend, I said ""You've gotta hear this"" and we've become total enthusiasts ever since.The songs have lyrics that make you think: Does this mean what it is saying, or does it mean something else entirely.The songs have musical quality that makes your brain tingle and your ears longing for more of the crazy wind instruments and such.And of course, Captain Beefheart's voice. He has so many different voices he sings and speaks in, and they all fit so well with his funky tunes.BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
5,One of the VERY BEST albums in any genre,"This is one of the VERY BEST albums in any genre, and it covers several genres itself! Along with Van Dyke Parks' Song Cycle, Peter Ivers' Knight of the Blue Communion, Pugh Rogefeldt's Ja A Da Ja and Zalman Yanovsky's Alive and Well in Argentina it exists in a world of its own creation. The marvel of all these idiomatic musical pieces is that are so incredibly good! The Beefheart, in particular, is as great in terms of sheer music-making as Szell and the Cleveland performing a middle Mozart symphony or Coltrane's My Favorite Things or Heifetz, Piatagorsky and Feuermann performing Schubert's chamber music. Heads up! You can't do better than this rockin' little gem if your ears are strong enough to handle the DEEP pleasures the Good Captain stirred into it."
2,Poorly Written,"This book is poorly written, but interesting if you're a social worker at the DSS office on Cape Cod. I know both the writer and many people in the book. It was just confusing to read."
3,"Interesting, but not fulfilling my expectations.","This is a curious book. It gives an overview of Elvis' spiritual search as seen through the eyes of Larry Geller, his personal hairdresser and self-proclaimed Guru. Geller got Elvis to explore his spiritual side mainly through New Age readings and meditation, and his own conversations with him. But the book seems to be a series of anecdotes, and bits and pieces of information thrown together. It was interesting, but did not give the kind of insight into Elvis' spirituality that I was expecting from Mr. Stearn. Perhaps I am expecting too much - Elvis the mystic?"
3,Hastily Thrown Together,"I was hoping to find out more about what Elvis had on his bookshelf in regard to spiritual books, his own beliefs, where his upbringing came in, etc...This seemed like a quickly done book of stuff we already knew.I preferred ""If I Can Dream."""
3,"great game, but not enough questions!","My wife and I bought Mad About Movies because we're big movie fans, and it is a fun game. It has recent movies, asks questions of different skill levels, and won't drag on forever like Trivial Pursuit.The problem is that there aren't enough questions! My wife and I only had to play the game a few times before we started seeing repeats. We then started playing less frequently and changed how we look at the cards to make sure we got to all of the items, and that helped, but that makes the game less fun.I wrote to Parklife, and they said they were planning a big expansion pack for the fall of 2001, but I haven't seen it yet. (I'm still waiting hopefully if someone from Parklife reads this.)"
2,It didn't feel like chanting to me,"I have listened to a variety of chanters from the Christian, Native American, Sufi and (like Bhagavan Das) Indian traditions. What strikes me about the chanting tradition is that it is the voice which is the primary instrument which must be the vehicle of this music. This CD has such a sophisticated sound mixing of the various instruments, and also highlights the instruments, to the point that the voice is simply part of the mix. I find the Vedic/Sanskrit chanting of Krishna Das, Wah, etc. to really put the voice out front even when a bunch of instruments are playing, and that allows the listener to key into the words (or more easily chant along), which strikes me as the point of chanting unless you just want it as some background music.This is not a bad album, but it just feels overproduced and a bit slick. It did raise my interest enough to want to hear him live and in a rawer form."
5,An excellent camera for low budget,"I took 100 high quality pictures with this camera at my cousin's wedding with the LCD on at all times (using an SD card). Almost 80% of the pictures I took were of superb quality which I was happy about, and I have yet to recharge the batteries I put into the camera the first time!! The camera also adjusts itself to deal with sunlight, light places, and most other environments which is the standard for higher range cameras.The only bad thing about this camera is that it has no optical zoom. Other than that, this camera gives you the best bang for your buck for both quality and economic efficiency. I highly recommend this camera for the budget user who wants something easy to use."
1,"Beware, you get what you pay for","Camera worked well for 13 months, as soon as warranty ends (12 Mos) camera will no longer turn on. Mfg's tech support was no help. PC software that accompanied camera was not user friendly to say the least. This was the first and last mustek product for me."
2,Weak battery door,"My MDC3500 was sitting on my desk one day, when I noticed it move. When I picked it up to see what had caused it to move the batteries fell out.The catch that holds the door closed had just broken off.It is now held shut with Scotch tape.Other then that the camera works fine."
3,Special Branch,Not exactly what I was looking for but not entirely a dud. A 70's era action series set in London. Good acting but not a lot of action. Slow moving.
4,Very easy to use!,"This deep fryer was the first electric one I've used, and it did a very good job. What I liked: The fryer assembled easily; it heats extremely fast, both at start-up and between batches; it produced consistent results start to finish; the oil holder is made of heavy-guage stainless steel; and --the basket, oil container, and lid all went into the dishwasher. I was prepared for a drippy, messy job, so I was very pleased to find that it was really simple to use and clean."
1,quality design,"the design of this fryer is great, it is all stainless steel, EZ to wash, with the exception of the electronics, I washed this with a damp cloth, just like they said to, and it stoped working after the first cleaning. maybe it was the heat or something.If they could make the electronics work.... this item would be great, but as it is now ... PASS!"
4,Read the instructions!!!,"This is a great deep-fryer. There is lots of room for the food, and clean up is a breeze. The adjustments give you just the right temperature for the food.That said, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! If you are like me, and just start using with a scan of the instructions, you are in for a rough time. The unit has a timer, which is great, and it turns the oil off when the timer goes off. You have to know to re-start the unit for each batch. Once you learn this, you'll have no problems!"
4,Annoying Settings,"This deep fryer does a good job frying food. There is plenty of room in the basket and it is relatively easy to clean. This would be a great deep fryer if the controls were not so annoying and complicated. You can't just 'set it and forget it', you have to follow a sequence of steps just to get the fryer to the desired temperature. Then you have to select a time period for the frying or the fryer will cut off. I find it all very annoying and unnecessary. All of that aside, the fryer does a good job and is probably the best buy available for the quality of fried foods."
2,Plastic is Cheap,"I really enjoy my Rival Deep Fryer. It is convenient, easy to care for, and no messes. The thing is dislike is the hard plastic they use for the handles and on the Back of the Main Body. Mine have broke of which has also caused it not to operate. The Control Panel has to be inserted into the Guide Rails, which can be done if they snap off. Also, the book on it does not say who the Manufacturer is or where you can buy replacement parts for it. So now I am unable to use it, and therefore I am going to have to buy a new one. This doesn't please me at all."
3,Cooking Odors Remain,"This product has a nice appearance, the basket on the handle is intact, quick to heat up, and is easy to clean. However, I have had similar products before and this one leaves cooking odors so badly I can hardly stand it. I rarely use mine because of that. It appears as if the filter material is not adequate - I am looking for ideas on how to remedy that situation because otherwise it is a good product."
2,ok,Worked good when I first got it. After a couple months it would turn off and on. The safety button/switch where the head slides on wouldn't hold. I stuck a clothes pin on it to hold it so it would stay on. It would still turn off sometimes. For the $ it should be much better made. I ended up giving it away.
5,I have a Restraunt in my kitchen!!,"I've only had mine for about a month, but we love it. This is my third deep fryer, and is definitely my favorite. Easy to use, easy to clean, and, looks nice too."
1,Another unobjective armenian book,"Out of curiousity, I visited the previous reviewer, N. Livadas's other reviews (using his own advice - to check on Adam's history or reviews). And, Oh My Goodness, I saw what I hoped not to see - the guy is doing the same things he blaims someone under the nick ""Adam"" doing. People like this make the world think about the armenians as being funny lyers. This is very unfortunate, since I personally have a lot of close friends from Armenia, as well as other parts of the Caucasus and I find that both sides have their own prism of seing things.Regardless of my sympathy to armenians as a naiton, I'd like to refer to the facts recognized by the internaitonal observers, and based on my thourough research on the history of conflict, I have to say that this particular piece is ""slightly"" misrepresenting the facts in favour to the armanian site."
5,A True Blessing,I have found this book to be a blessing as it walks one through practical steps that all lead to a closer walk with the Lord. Couldn't have asked for more.
4,Exciting Chases -- and a Lovable Dog,"As I look back, I still find it hard to believe that this was a debut novel. It holds up a lot better than romantic suspense by some of the veterans of the genre.The plot moves along at a fast pace. There are a few coincidences, but not so many that they spoil the read. The characters also fit the story well. As an added attraction, the Key West scenes are great.My own quibble is that the villains are off stage so much of the time. That's unavoidable with this type of plot, but it's usually not my cup of tea. (I prefer stories about villains hidden within a close circle of family or friends.) If you don't mind off-stage villains, you'll like this even more than I did.This book deserved its Golden Heart award. I gave it a B at All About Romance."
3,A nice disc!,"A really nice collection of Broadway songs, with strong arrangements and McDermott's impressive, wide-ranging voice at the front. This is a good Broadway disc, much better than recent releases from Kim Criswell (ugh!) and Betty Buckley."
2,The Voice Is Better Than The Way He Uses It,"Not a bad CD, and admittedly a pretty big voice. But in many of these songs the singer is reaching beyond his ability to interpret the music, and comes off sounding like a big queen at some birthday party singing showtunes. A Broadway leading man needs to take command of his songs, and on this CD it seems to be the other way around. Diction lessons should be on Sean's list of dreams to fulfill, without them, in ten years he may be doing nothing more than singing lounge music at The Monster on Fire Island."
3,Could be better,"I had gotten a black one in hopes that it would hold everything I needed for class. My two books, a sketchbook, a lots of pens and brushes, but the bag itself is actually the majority of the weight I'm carrying, and it doesn't hold quite as much as it looks like it might because the hooks just aren't heavy-duty enough to handle what the bag itself can. The twisting nob will pop out from the hook and the metal latches that keep the hooks on break easily, mine is not the only one it has happened to here. I just think that, for the price, it could use a few make-overs. If you can modify the strap components to hole more weight, go for it! If not, look for a different bag."
5,essential for any architect or student,"A fabulous survey of the conventions of architectural drawing in an easily referenced, concise format. Adequately covers the basics of orthographic, paraline, perspective, and rendering techniques. Good for the first time student just learning, or the experienced architect looking for a brush up."
4,architectural graphics,"This book is a lot older than I expected, one of the earlier published but all the same it came quickly, thanks :)"
1,Not a good book for Beginners,"When I first got the book I thought it was basic Tagalog, but it wasn't. This book is for people that know some Tagalog. It was very hard to use for learning the language. Not a good book for beginners."
1,NAGSISISI AKO!,WOW!I got this book back in 2003 and I dont recommend this book for begginers its very complex to understand I would rather get Beginning Tagalog: A Course for Speakers of Englishby J. D. Bowen
4,Good book but dated.,I bought this book to learn tagolog to meet phillipino girls. I know alot of them and to score cool points I thought I would learn the launguage. Well it turns out alot of the translations are no longer used since this book was first published in 1956. Its still a good book for someone who spoke English all their life.
2,Missed the Aliens,"Alien Seed is a not to be seen alien bomb. The only highlight was the bar scene and the end of the movie. Erik is not seen much and when he does appear he is still not seen. The two government agents are the only fun part of the movie and it's unfortunate we have not seen more of them. If you want to see a true ""C"" movie then go ahead and buy it. But I recommend you save your dollars for some old Roy Rogers movies. They'll definitley be more satisfying."
2,This is NOT a text book.,"Let me reiterate, this is not a textbook. It's a collection of interviews with people have designed new/different things. It teaches nothing about proper designing and brainstorming. It might be inspriring, but it has no real use as far as teaching/learning goes."
2,Not detailed enough for a class book,"This would be good book to a person that is in interested in products that people already designed, but it doesn't contain enough information to become a product designer. This book was required inside our class of product design, but quickly dismissed for a book that gave more information on the technical aspects of a design."
2,Product Brochure,"This ""brochure"" is a great way to see and learn about the product someone else has already designed. It does not give and lessons on becoming a product designer. There are no exercises that can help you expand you skills in designing a new product or modifying an existing one. On the plus side it has some cool pictures. This book would be great in the lobby of a manufacturing company so their visitors have something to read while they're waiting."
2,aka Series of Interviews Including Advice from Current Successful Prosuctr Designer,"This book would be very suitable for a person already through college and working in the field as a CAD designer. The book didn't deal with too much of HOW to become a product designer and what all will be seen and should be known. Product design isn't something everybody can do so it should not be summed up into one book. Product design is such a broad title dealing with numerous different fields of work including manufacturing, designing, engineering, research and design, etc. etc. etc."
3,Probably my least favorite Thom Brennan,"I'm sorry to say, that this album isn't up to the standards of his other album. It lacks the flow and grace that the others have. Perhaps its due to the fact that this is a collection of short songs instead of a few long flowing ones. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing ""Vibrant Water"" instead."
5,"Signals in Moonlight, depart and fly","Signals in Moonlight is a great departure from Thom Brennan. It transcends, but provides an intricate web of sound and beat in addition to his musical journeys that take you places known and unknown. I'd like to hear more from him like this."
5,iPhone off the floor,"This well-made mount far exceeds my expectations, is ruggedly built, and well designed. I coupled my Life Proof belt clip with it using serious double stick automotive tape (the black stuff) and now my phone is safe and secure in my FJ.Love this and installed another on the passenger side for my lovely bride and turned my brother on to it for his Silverado dually.A must have."
5,the title says it all,"yes sir this is one bass heavy album, even by dub standards.if you're thinking of buying this i guess you're already a twilight circus fan and personally i think everything he's done is of the highest quality, this is no exception.standout tracks are - the bouncing 'lowell and nine'. the deep, almost trance inducing 'bong loop' and the laid back skank of 'porno'. to be honest i'd say all the tracks are standout but these are my personal favourites.so give your speakers a workout, buy this album and then buy everything the guys ever recorded. it doesnt get any better than this"
2,A choppy book,"Hal Wallis is a worthy subject for a big biography, but this book doesn't get the job done. It is simply not thorough enough.A warning: If you're interested in Wallis' fantastic years at Warner Bros. - the era of Bogart, Cagney, Raft, Flynn, Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan - this book isn't for you. The author spends much more time dealing with Wallis' independent productions, particularly his big budget productions in the 1960s and early 1970s. Hal Wallis, a superb movie producer, certainly deserves a book that is more focused and complete."
1,A Major Disappointment,I agree with the other reviewers: Wallis' prime identity and chief claim to fame was his monumental work at Warner Bros. from 1933-1944. This is what he will be best remembered and revered for - and to just quickly brush over this vital period of his career is really unforgivable. The author must have been just walking through the paycheck line in a hurry with this book. It reads like a college thesis in which the student just wanted a passing grade and really had no commitment or interest in his topic. Obviously the Hyer interview was easy to obtain and the author just sailed through with it and made it the bulk of his lazy research. Pretty sorry and poor stuff - what a disappointment for any movie fan who appreciates the classics!
1,It is Wallis,"Is it the author, is it the subject? Four of the five competent reviews so far seem to lean on the former. I tend to to feel that a man of Wallis' rigidity and deviousness got his posts to exactly fit the needs of the mogul studio system. It is not easy to write well about an apparatshik, even if he occasionally had a good hand. So neither subject nor book are worth much - I agree.fbus 52 - Dick-Wallis - 28/7/2012"
3,"Okay, but not as good as Gloria Jean","Weak French Vanilla (especially if you make a travel size cup for work).I prefer Gloria Jean's French Vanilla Supreme, it's a little darker and much smoother (not to mention cheaper)."
1,WARNING: Version 2 of this software does NOT support the V3,"WARNING: Do not buy Mobile Phone Tools version 2. Motorola tech support has informed me that it does not support the RAZR V3. Motorola's Mobile Phone Tools version 3 (SKU: 98654H) is supposed to, though. You'll probably need to go to the Motorola website to get this, since Amazon doesn't seem to have it."
1,Misleading,"When I bought my Motorola Razr V3, the Phonetools came up under related items. This led me to believe the software was compatible with my phone. It isn't. It does specify the software only works on the V600 under the Product Desciption which I should have looked at. The Phonetools for every other Motorola phone is available elsewhere. Just a heads up."
4,Warning for Verizon customers,The package is very simple and does work as advertised - UNLESS your carrier is Verizon. The firmware they put on prevents you from getting pictures/video/ringtones on or off the phone so that you have to use their messenging services to email them off. Phone book and Calendar still seem to work correctly...
1,Ok cards,Well first off I am a big fan of copaq cards but this set let me down big time the black deck is warped very badly the plastic insert tab was pushed so far down it marked the cards on the edge this espn poker nights setup was a waste of money I even bought a another set from a local poker shop to test them same thing warped and dents all on the cards I still love copaq cards thou.
2,"Nostalgic, Yet Mean-Spirited","I was drawn to pick up this book when I saw the cover--the picture of the author as a young boy is irresistible. Although the content was interesting, I found myself quickly becoming annoyed by the author's numerous slurs towards our younger generation. I found his words to be increasingly mean-spirited and I finally put the book down for good when he made light of both children and their parents who are faced with the struggle of bipolar disorder. The author reminds me of many older Americans who can't see that the world has changed greatly since the 1940's and that our younger generation has many redeeming characteristics."
2,"An exercise in weirdness, but little more than that","Yo La Tengo fans should beware; this album is not exactly what they might expect.I give this 2 stars for a certain curiosity factor and for the kinda wacky lyrics, but in terms of music and production, this is a far cry from other Yo La Tengo albums. ""Weak"" sounds like an understatement.Even though the music is credited to YLT, this is much more of a Jad Fair album. Their musical talents hardly shine through as the production is a devil-may-care kind of lo-fi, the songs rarely extend beyond 2 minutes and seem mere fragmented vehicles to transport Fair's jumbled vocals. A major disappointment."
2,"David Fair is a poor, poor songwriter","Yo La Tengo's music here is lazy, but Jad Fair's decision to recite joke lyrics written by his brother David is what really kills this record. David's songs sound like they were written by a 12-year-old -- all obvious rhymes and stupid punchlines. It's ghastly."
5,"Hillarious, Good Music!","This CD is pure enjoyment. With the always great musical stylings of Yo La Tengo, and the hillarious lyrics of Jad Fair it can't be beat!"
2,Disappointed with Coffee,"The store who sold this ""AM COFFEE"" was fabulous. There service and presentation of the product was great. I did not like the flavor of the coffee however. The beans were very greasy and it tasted more like vanilla."
5,Top Ideas for Combining Home and Career - still best availab,"How'd we get here? What are the REAL problems today? And most importantly of all, how do you DO IT ALL without going crazy?Offers practical ideas you can use"
5,Good Cutting Board,The cutting board was exactly as described and perfect for preparing small meals. With just me and my roommate to cook for it was exactly what I was looking for in a cutting board. Fast delivery. I would definately use this seller again.
1,Did not last one day!!!,"I bought this together with a Canon Rebel XSi and some lenses, the whole kit from Cameta Camera. The items arrived intact and I looked like a kid on X-mas day. I opened the Vanguard VT-126 and extended it to test its features and on my first crank of the extension shaft...the crank stayed in my hand. Upon close examination, the shaft turned by the crank is made out of plastic, not metal. Hey designers, lose weight somewhere else, this part needs to be made out of metal or it will break, just a matter of time!I paid $60 for it, but I see lots of options on Amazon.com for less than that with more stars.Ohh, but if you decide you don't need to raise the tripod and looks are important to you, this tripod looks great!"
5,Great to use as leave-behind,I found this book to be a concise and easily understood overview of what XML can do for business. I've shared copies with one or two special clients and gotten a positive response.
4,Covers light detail of most aspects of XML,"Even at 150 pages, this book could have been shorter. Its covers XML just enough to let you have a good idea of how each of the technologies that go into XML work with each other and just enough to be able to create XML documents yourself.However, a soft point of the book is that goes into a little fluff at times, presumably because it is ""A manager's guide"", talking a lot about nothing consequential. There were several paragraphs that could have easily been summed up in a single sentance, (fortunately, at times they were summarized in the sidebar).Nevertheless, it does give you a solid understanding of most of the concepts of XML and a good starting place for those wanting to work with the technology, whether manager or not."
4,"Good High-Level, Non-Technical Introduction to XML","XML (eXtensible Markup Lanaguage) is an evolving and increasingly important language used to efficiently and effectively communicate data in context...put another way, to communicate information.""XML: A Manager's Guide"" offers a clearly-written and well-illustrated guide for executives who want to learn about XML. I recommend this book for anyone interested in gaining some insight into the nature and benefits of this language.This is an introductory book, but it provides a good foundation upon which one may build a deeper understand of, and appreciation for, XML."
2,Not wearable!,"We bought this under the impression that it was wearable. There is no verbiage on the box saying something like ""Warning: this toy not meant for wearing. Attempts to do so may result in toddler meltdown"". Our daughter is not quite 3 yet, and skinny as a rail and this pack will not fit at all. The games are ok, I suppose, and the pack seems fairly durable, otherwise I would give it a 1 star rating. Overall, very unimpressed."
2,Not Backpack Pictured,"I ordered this for my 3-year-old daughter who is obsessed with Dora because she loves the show so much. Unfortunately, the ""backpack"" we received with the games in it is not the actual Backpack from the show as is pictured. It was a very small plastic backpack with a screened on picture of Dora and Boots. Nice enough to hold the card games, but not what I thought I was getting."
1,Not What I was Looking For,"I bought this book on the assumption that it was edited by the LOR, Viggo Mortenson. I understand he is the ownwer of an editing company and sometimes writes editorial notes in material his company publishes.... my mistake!!! This book was written by a very learned professor of systematic theology and the director of the center for Multireligious Studies at Aarhus University in Denmark.....not the same guy.... Im sure its an interesting read for the right person."
1,One star to Amazon not the book!!!!,"Amazon should know better. It is possible in the whole world that 2 writers share the same name !You shoud not list Viggo Mortensen's works of art : poetry /photography/paintings/and movies with Viggo Mortensen's writings about theological concepts. The former is the actor, artist, and the latter is the theologian.Please, be consistent ! A little clean up is in order (no pun intended!)."
3,how many Viggo Mortensen's can there be?,I also bought this book thinking it was the celebrity Viggo Mortensen's. Wonder how many have been sold for that reason? It really is a fascinating book but a challenging read.
4,So far very happy,"I was a little nervous about buying a non nikon brand at first but so far am very pleased. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and for the price you can't beat it. I can't compare to the nikon sb ones and am not a professional but this flash works well. It does work with the ittl functions of the nikon, recharge time is good, can move up down left and right and forward and back giving lots of choice. The bounce works well, aim it at the ceiling and even in a room with the lights off gives a nice well it photo without the harshness of the built in flash.Only cons is it is a bit big/bulky. And parts of it seem a little flimsy like the battery cover, but I would say anyone whos looking for a decent back up or wants a decent flash but doesnt want to drop a few hundred this seems a good choice."
2,Great when it works,"When I first got this flash it was great, I never had any issues with it and gave me good quality photos. After a few months it became very unreliable and most of the time it won't work at all. At first I thought it could have been the batteries but when I swapped them out the flash continued to not work. Over all I love this flash when I can get it to work but but due to the unreliability of it I would not recommend this flash unit."
5,good flash,This flash works on my Nikon camers as good as any Nikon flash I could have purchased and at more than half the price. I bought a second one for my wifes new camera.
4,Flashlight,Very easy to use. Paying off its cost. Does not have a case / cover to protect it when it is removed from the camera. The light lens angle adjuster works OK but with the time passing by this frictional locator will be worn.
3,first flash,"My first external flash, no complaints. In the spring of 2011, I moved up from 15 years of point and shoot digital cameras to my first digital SLR a Nikon D90. I have images I cherish from my first magic camera , which provided a small fraction of a megapixel to work with. So the move upward has been fun. At this point I've only done a couple of shoots with the Bower flash, but considering my ignorance, I found it easy to use and what ever was lacking in the results on just a few shots, was probably more my fault than the Bower's."
5,Best book I read in 1946!,Each year I pick the best book read that year. In 1946 I read 78 books--48 fiction and 30 non-fiction. This great book was the best one I read that year
2,Blitzstein Revival,"I had wanted the 196? revival of this show starring Jerry Orbach which is not available on CD so I was glad to have one I did not have to worry about scratching it. However, it was my fault in that I really wanted the Orbach. This revival is somewhat lacking in the energy and the appreciation of the sarcasm of the earlier one. Perhaps someone who had not seen the earlier revival or the film about the infamous opening [and cloing] night of the original production would not know what was missing in this one but I did."
5,"Ahh, Ahh Awesome!","I ordered this dvd to replace one that was lost. A little girl's gotta have her Mermaid Movie! I received it quickly, in great condition for an excellent price. Another awesome, Amazon experience. Thank you!"
4,Discs in great condition.,Very happy with the quality of the two discs. No problems at all with them. My only complaint though is that they did not come in a Little Mermaid case. Just in a little plastic sleeve. That should be stated so people know before ordering.
4,Great Disney Movie,Great Disney movie for kids to watch! Definitely old VHS format! Can't wait for it to be out on blue-ray!
4,Great movie!,"One of my favorites and glad to have it in my collection. Amazon shipped it in perfect condition, great product!"
5,Great Stuff,Well done remastering. Colors are nice and vivid. Everything we remember from the theatres back when it was orginally released. Worth buying!
5,Little Mermaid,"What I thought might just ba a kids movie was pretty entertaining, the songs, the humor, and the storyline makes you feel like a kid all over again. Once again Disney movies a great family entertainment'"
4,little mermaid rocks.,My daughter loved it. It brought back memories when i use to work at block buster video. Kids and adults alike would sit there and watch the video as we replayed it over and over again.
1,Wait to Buy,"Disney is re-releasing this movie on BluRay and DVD in the Spring of 2013. I would wait if I were you, till then, and buy this movie from your local Wal-Mart or Hastings, at a much lower rate. Don't waste your money on someone trying to take advantage of you!!"
3,The Little Mermaid review,"It is good, but for some reason, my dvd player has a hard time reading it and it wont play in my car and it wont play any of the extras. But no scratches and my daughter's have watched it a million times, so we are happy with our purchase."
5,very happy,very fast and looks new!! friendly feel from shipper and i love that it is guaranteed because it is used
2,Was not new,"I purchased this under the impression that it was new. The dvd was shrink wrapped....poorly I might add...with air bubbles, and burnt edges....( I used to shrink wrap things at an office supply chain, so I know what it looks like)...the inserts looked like they were obviously printed. The movie works/plays, but I dont think I got a genuine Disney movie."
5,The Little Mermaid Platnum Edition,"My Wife loves the movie, but you can't buy it in stores any more. It is perfect! Thanks She loved it as a gift."
4,Little mermaid DVD Quality,The sound is great (full-digital) and the video is crisp and clear. The extras on this DVD were extremly lacking. No extra audio or video selection (Widescreen or Standard) but the standard language selection! Also there was a slight video pause in chapter 17. Overall great DVD to add to the Disney collection.
5,mermaid,"one of disneys best, love ariel and eric, what a s\love story. flounder is soooooo cute. is a must for disney fans, a keeper."
1,Walt Disney runs out of steam.,"Out of all the modern Disney Classics, this one is definitely the worst (although ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" run close second). Weak songs, weak story. It will make you a pirate for their days of glory in ""The Lion King"" and ""Hercules."""
1,Not to happy!,"Well i had ordered this item for a Christmas gift for my girlfriend. When i bought it it said that i would receive it the Friday before Christmas. I paid extra for shipping to make sure it got here on time. I didn't get it until two days after Christmas, i was pretty pissed. It was sent through DHL and they said they messed it up, so i don't blame amazon. I only gave it a two stars because, yes the item was shipped in the condition it was supposed to be in. But that doesn't change the fact that i didn't get it for Christmas."
1,Never received this item!,I am so disappointed I ordered this movie for my daughter for Christmas so she could watch it before we go on a Disney Cruise but we never received it from the seller! I feel that Amazon has really let me down and I will think twice before shopping on this site again.
1,2012 NEXT ON LINE DISAPPOINTED ME,"I ordered a dvd on line because I couldn't find it in the store for my granddaughter. They said my purchase shipped but I could not track it or get in touch with them. They took my money however.I could not get in touch with them through Amazon, they said they had decided to leave Amazon. They were called 2012 NEXT ON LINE. I am frustrated hoping this will not lead to fraud on my account and I would like a refund. Fortunately a reputable seller got a dvd to me in time."
1,Granddaughter waiting!,This product was ordered with another order and this order has not yet arrived. Granddaughter crying! Please help Amazon.
1,do not have item yet,I ordered Jan 23I went on a long vac just got home MondayHave not recevied this item yetI am getting worried it's for a birthday which is tomorrowother items came promptly
1,came in boken case loose dvd all scrached,broken not packaged well would not buy from them ever again very dissopointed was for my three yr old she was not happy and not to send it back i have to pay to ship back there messsssss up!!!!!
5,great buying experience,"Finding, buying and receiving ""the little mermaid"" DVD was as easy as 1-2-3. I received the product days before I expected it and it was just as advertised: perfect!"
5,One Of My First,i still remember getting this video for my 3rd birthday. i watched it then and i watch it now that im 18. its one of the best classic disney movies. and although i have this movie on VHS i would still buy it on DVD.
5,My Favorite Disney Movie of All Time,"This is my favorite Disney movie and I'm so glad that it has been released onto DVD. I just found out that I'm going to have a baby girl, so I'm so excited to be able to share this movie with her and raise a Disney fan. The songs in this movie are amazing and you'll find yourself humming them when the movie isn't even on.This is a must own if you are a Disney fan."
4,My kid loves it!,"We used to own a copy of Disney's The Little Mermaid when my little boy was 5, he eventually wore it out completely and we had to get rid of it. Sadly, the movie hasn't been on print except for a recent DVD release, but the price was a bit too much for us so we decided to rent the library copy. Although this one was almost as worn out as our own, my son enjoys this movie everytime he watches it and is now patiently waiting for a future DVD release. A must have for anyone who enjoys a good children's film."
2,format,"The disc was a regular DVD, but will not play in most DVD players. It will only play on a computer or in a Playstation."
2,another low-budget Disney money sponge,"I was disappointed with the production values on this ""Limited Time Only"" Platinum edition. The colors seem gray and washed out, the sound seems ... uhh ... gray and washed out, the animation seems ... hmmmmmmm ... jittery and fractionated. Ok, maybe I got a badly burned copy and Your Mileage May Vary. Unfortunately, this effort seems about what I'd expect from the ""Tease 'em Today, Promise 'em Tomorrow"" consumer engineers that pass for Eisnerville these days. Pixar does it right. Compare the burning sea colors in Finding Nemo with this, e.g. Another thing, if you're a BIG FAN of the team that did Pocahontas you'll love L.M. all over again. To me, it just seems very dated."
1,Fake DVD but seller made it right.....,"We ordered this DVD so we could entertain our kids on a trip to Florida. My wife noticed that the packaging looked a little weird and faded but didn't think much about it until she opened the cover. She immediately noticed that the disk had small scratches everywhere and upon further inspection, the DVD's had very poor image quality on the labels and the word ""Disk"" was actually spelled ""DESK""!! Not on one dvd but both of them!! WE loaded the DVD into our van DVD player and it wouldn't even play. Needless to say we where very upset the DVD was fake. I emailed the seller when we returned and she immediately made things right. She fully refunded us for the price of the DVD and shipping costs. I would do business with them again because I don't think they had any idea the DVD was fake. It was in clear packaging and they never opened it."
1,Poor Seller,Ordered item (DVD) the day after Thanksgiving and have not received the item or response from Seller when I tried to contact. Needed to hurry and reorder from another Seller.
1,It was awful!,"The DVD that I purchased was advertised as a 'new' product but upon delivery it was found to be open, used and damaged. I am most upset because I paid over $30.00 for the product. Thank goodness it was my niece I was sending it to and not a friend. I would have been mortified to send a defective product to a friend. If it is at all possible to get a refund or new DVD, I would like one.Sarah"
1,never got the product no response from amazon or seller!!!!!,The customer service from both amazon and seller were bad I still have never heard from either or got my product BUT i was billed
3,mermaid had time to grow up,"item came in about 7 business days with paying for expedited shipping... not too pleased with that, considering that the item was shipped from a neighboring state. so needless to say, i doubt i'll order from this company again"
3,A little disappointed,"The DVD itself was new and unopened like it should have been, but based on the picture I thought it was going to have the DVD sleeve to go with it and it did not. I was a little disappointed for the price I paid. I bought the Peter Pan DVD that same day for the same price and it came in a DVD sleeve."
5,The Little Mermaid,Happy with the product and most especially happy with fast shipping and handling. Thank you.
1,What a rip off.,"This is a major rip off don't buy from this seller. Its obviously a boot leg. First off it won't even play on my DVD player because it's a boot leg I had to play it on my laptop. Second, it has many edits it's not thye orginal and it looks like someone with a steady hand video taped it while it was palying from VHS. It's homemade. It's not even worth the money. Don't trust this seller. Horrible quality."
1,Scratched & Skipped in a Box,"the DVD skips beyond belief, it doesn't play cleanly on any machine. Wasted my money, wish I could REWIND and purchase a workable DVD. Kids were beyond disappointed."
5,It's how she rolls....,"my 4 year old, anyway. She's been very into mermaids for the last 2 years. She just adores this movie and sings all the songs, has many mermaid and Ariel dolls, a mermaid swimuit, and clothes. Wowza. She loves the pre and sequals as well. I loved this movie as a girl, and it's one of the few movies that she watches repeatedly that doesn't drive me nuts the 3rd time around."
4,One of Disney's best,"Love what Disney has done with the Little Mermaid tale, in particular the change to a happily ever after ending (in the original she turns to foam, at least that's what I remember) that being said, the transfer to DVD is not up to Disneys high standards, not really bad just not as good as one has come to expect from Disney, never the less I highly recommend getting this disc, hopefully Disney will come out with a BLU-RAY edition, till then this isn't bad, enjoy the story and artistry of the animators, a little film grain doesn't really distract from ones enjoyment"
4,Great DVD that arrived fast,The DVD arrived within 3 business days and besides one little skip in the DVD for a brief second has no other issues. We are very pleased and our daughter loves it.
3,The Little Mermaid,"Its ok, but the disk stalls and stops playing. I was really disappointed. This is the purchase i was most excited about."
5,Cute,"Got this for my wife and she opened it and watched it same day. This was her favorite movie growing up, so she had some sentimental value to it."
5,The Little Mermaid DVD,This was requested by our granddaughters and we were so happy to find in on Amazon. It is very good.
3,Mermaid DVD,Disk skips so I was disappointed. Fortunately I have a machine to create the issue. In good condition. Thank you.
2,Disc skipped,"I ordered this DVD for my 5 year old daughter for x-mas because she loves the Little Mermaid but never actually saw the movie. The DVD that we recieved was not the original, it had scratches on it and kept skipping. We tried the DVD on multipe dvd players and tried wiping it as well. Thankfully, Amazon refunded my money on this one so I could buy from a different seller."
3,Not 100% satisfied,I order this movie and the saler said it was a new movie. It was a new movie but it was a copy.
2,Copy.. :(,"This Movie is clearly a copy and not an the manufactured edition of this movie.... The colors on the packagaing are wrong.. the silkscreening on the DVD is bad and the colors in the DVD itself are less then aceptable,,,, will not purchase from this vedor again.."
5,"The best, Under the sea!","Needless to say, this is the best disney movie ever made. Ursula is one of the nost nastiest villians ever! She is cool..."
5,Pure Magic,"I was three when the movie came out to theaters and it has been part of my life ever since then. I don't think there's ever been anything that appealed to me as much as The Little Mermaid has. I find it hard to write a review and find the right words to describe this movie. The Little Mermaid sparked something deep down in my soul a long time ago. It reminds you of your dreams and your hopes. It's pure magic! This movie touched so many people over the years and it's still waiting for another generation to do the same. Today or Tomorrow, even a hundred years from now this will remain one of Disney's greatest."
4,A childhood Favorite!,"The music is still amazing after all these years. The quality, although not blue ray, looked great on a hi def television. My sons thought it was girly at first, but now they want to watch it more than I do! Platinum edition is worth it, if you have children."
5,Great,It took me to my childhood days. I bought it used and it is like new. I am very satified and will be buying from them again.
5,Excellent,"I received this product very promptly. The product was in excellent condition, and everything was just as promised."
5,The Little Mermaid,"Well, there's not much to say, the product is wonderful, this is one of my favorite motion pictures ever!And the service is great, I got the package really fast, and there were no problem what so ever!"
3,Fine animated flick for somewhat older kids,"Great animation but parents beware. Some of the scenes are downright frightening for small childern. Furthermore, my wife and I (liberal Democrats at that) were shocked at some of the content. Lines like ""you want her"" and Ursula referring to Ariel as a ""little tramp"" made us uncomfortable with having our 3 year old daughter watch. We know kids have to learn about this stuff, but I would prefer not to have to deal with it in a Disney film! We have shelved it for the time being in favor of ""The Aristocats"""
1,Received half of order,"I placed an order for two copies of the Little Mermaid from an Amazon third party supplier (Yeomanill) several weeks ago. After a few days, I received one of the copies which arrived in a damaged case. The disc inside worked, but I wasn't happy with the condition in which we got it. A day or so later, I received an email telling me my order was delivered and I was billed for both of the sets I ordered.I contacted Amazon to file a complaint, and they directed me to their customer support portal through I could contact Yeomanill directly. I emailed a complaint to them explaining the situation, and wanted them to send the second item or remove the charge for it. A week later I sent another email stressing the same request.It's been nearly a month since I received half of my order, and a week and a half since sending my second complaint. I've heard nothing yet.I have never had a problem with Amazon, but I strongly advise you never to order anything from Yeomanill."
1,SLOW BOAT TO CHINA,"It has taken a month and I still have not received the video that I ordered. Two other videos were ordered at the same time on December 9, 2010, & they arrived well before Christmas."
1,haven't recieved it yet!!!,"i ordered this video on nov. 3rd of 2010. i have yet to recieve it. today's date is dec. 8th. it was suppose to be here within 3-5 business days. how do i review this video? when and if i get both of the one's that i ordered, i will be happy to let you know!!!"
1,Little Mermaid,"I never received my platinum 2 disc set of the Little Mermaid, the money was taken out of my account, but no movie was ever received!!!!! It was ordered on Nov. 2, 2010 and was suppose to be here at the latest on Nov. 26th and it is still not here. I need the movie immediately or I need my refund immediately. Please take care of this matter today!! I'm very unhappy with Amazon.com, this was a birthday gift for my grandchild in Japan, and she is still waiting for that part of her present. All of her presents were sent late because of waiting for this movie.Please settle this matter now.Marcia Hackerson"
3,The Little Mermaid,Arrived very quickly. Outside case was broken and i was never made aware of that in the description.
2,Dissapointed,"I wasn't so sure to buy anything used ""that looks like new"". I was dissapointed with this dvd because it is defective. I had difficulty watching the begginning and also selecting language options. I should have gotten a new one for $4 dlls more."
3,Typical Disney Movie,"This is the typical Disney movie: beautiful animation, entertaining songs, sweet story, and multiple scenes too scary for children to enjoy. At least it is easy to skip the frightening scenes with a DVD, but it is frustrating to have to do that."
3,copied dvd not in case,i wish i knew this wasnt the real platinum adition that you can buy in stores. instead its a copied dvd not in original case.
3,DVD Quality less than up to Par!,The DVD picture quality was bad and the DVD skips at multiple parts through the movie. I guess you get what you pay for...
3,Love the movie but not the packaging,"Although the movie works/runs fine the color on the jacket was faded and looked like someone printed it from their home printer :/ I was assuming they had purchased it a while ago when it was released from Disney before it went into the vault so that i would be getting a complete genuine copy, but it seems that only the actual dvd was genuine, the jacket in the case was artificial. I most likely would not buy from this seller again."
4,My Favorite Disney Film,"The Little Mermaid is without a doubt a timeless classic. In my opinion it's the best modern Disney work since Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. Character development, plotline, visuals, vocals...everything is superb! Plus unforgettable songs like ""Under the Sea"", ""Kiss the Girl"", and my favorite ""Part of Your World"".I rated this item with 4 stars and not 5 because the Limited Edition DVD has very little special features... by little I mean almost none. If you can wait for the Platinum Edition, then I'd suggest you wait. I couldn't wait so that is why I got this edition."
5,woot,I love this movie and it came quickly and in great new condition. I couldnt have chosen a better product to order.
5,love it,I have been looking for this movie for my daughter and was glad to have found one that I did not pay a arm and leg for.
4,Perfect,I bought this for my daughter for christmas. The movie and its case are in great condition. The movie made a great addition to our collection.
5,Great movie at a great price.,My daughter really loves this movie so I got a pre-owned one and we watched it together and loved the film. Classic Disney. Thanks.
4,Little Mermaid DVD,Disneys original classic story of a mermaid that wants to be human. Lots of kool songs and cute story. My son loves it!
3,Not much effort put into the dvd,The dvd version is no different from the vhs. no special features are added and neither are the colors much different.
1,Advertised as NEW condition----should have said beaten and bruised,"I sent this movie to my 2 1/2 year old niece. When my sister took the video out of the package (it was (re)shrink-wrapped), it was scuffed and scratched. She was already thinking, ""This is New condition"". We all could have lived with that, but the movie stalls in playback. Try explaining that to a toddler. What's worse is that I contacted the company twice and didn't get any response at all. Amazon's A-Z Claim has resolved the issue, but should that have been necessary? If you are going to advertise a product, at least back it up with a response when you are contacted."
1,pirated,this is a pirated version of the movie. No meneus and the bonus disc doesnt work at all. Very unhappy
1,DVD didn't work,"I received the DVD and the cover was in good shape.. But when I put it in to watch, it played half way through the movie and quit. It does not work at all now."
1,buy from someone else,The quality was horrible. The DVD wouldn't play. Buy from someone else. I bought this dvd as a gift and my niece couldn't watch it. It was awful.
1,Duplicate not new,This item advertised as new in box sealed with cover. When I opened it I could tell that it was a duplicate not original. When I went to add the disney movie reward code it was confirmed by the site saying the code was already used. This is a bootleg.
3,is it worth it?,too much money for an old movie... Being that it was a platinum Edition I thought I was getting something special.
1,Aweful movie,"I rememeber when I was little I absolutely loved this movie, I loved skuttle the most he was a very cute bird, I still do like most of the music in this movie the movie itself though...So here is a girl who rebels against her father to get her own stubborn way and in the end seems to be rewarded for it, plus there is a scene of animated nudity in this film as she transforms from mermaid to human, the sea witch is just too dispicable for my children to watch... by far one of the worst disney movies EVER. I would recomend Tangled or Cinderella over the little mermaid."
3,"Love the movie, quality is not good.","The quality of this DVD is poor. I think I may be spoiled to bluray, HE, 1080p......I will purchase again when it is finally digitally remastered."
2,Invalid online code,"I am feeling a bit ripped off. Went to enter the Disney code only to find out this was used and the code not valid.Too late to return, so beware"
5,As Respresented,"After reading reviews from some sites where some people received copies or foreign versions of the video they order, I was a little worried about ordering this video. It came exactly as represented and arrived before I expected it. I'm very pleased."
4,An amazing movie,"The picture and sound quility of the film are amazing on DVD. The story is absolutely breathtaking. The only knock I have about the DVD is for the extra price of being a Disney DVD, why couldn't they throw in a few extras like so many other DVD movie releases have done - I felt that Disney got cheap on us on that respect, that's why I gave them 4 stars, instead of 5. The movie on widescreen will blow you and your children away, but I was expecting a few extras like most other DVD's."
5,Platinum Edition,"To those who mentioned it before regarding it's lack of ""Platinum Edition"" on the cover, the actual Disney store website titles it as a Platinum Edition even though the cover does not appear to say it. It also comes with lithographs and/or plush toys when ordering it through them, not sure if it's the same for it's general release everywhere. Hope that answered any questions."
2,cheap,This edition is not worth your time & money.Wait until October 2006 for the 2 disc platinum edition.You won't be sorry.
5,Just waiting for Blu-Ray...,"I bought this for my brother's bday as well as Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin (3 favorites as kids) and he said it was in great condition, arrived in a timely manner, no issues. GREAT movie; I heard a rumor they are re-releasing it in 3D before it goes to Blu-ray so I'm gonna have to make sure I keep on the look out for that one. One of my favorite Disney movies!"
4,Good-I t was a gift for my niece .,It was a Christmas gift for my niece .Couldn't find for sell anywhere but found it at Amazon.com.Wan't able to find it any retail stores here in Columbus either....thanks....
5,Happy Family,I loved this movie when I was a little girl and now I get to enjoy all over again! Not only my daughter loves this movie but my son is just as entertained! Shipped fast! Perfect! Thank you
3,"Worth it, but not for very long.","I rented this movie last night after going years without seeing it, and I hardly remembered anything from it. I absolutely loved it and was actually more excited to watch it again than I was to watch it the first time. I understand why this DVD is so expensive, as the movie isn't available in stores, isn't on YouTube, and never plays on TV, and it may be worth your money, but keep in mind it's set to come out of the Disney Vault in just a few years (I think it'll be 2 years, since that'll be its 25th anniversary)."
5,the little mermaid,i was blown away that i could find disney clasics to be available whenever i wanted them! usualy i have a habbit of being nostalgic and thinking hey id like to have that movie that i loved as a kid and would go to purchace it only to find that its locked in the disney vault! but here they are available whenever i want them and at a much more reasonable price. thanks amazon!
5,One Of The Masterpieces,"Im not kidding,this is Disney at its absolute BEST!This film was good at everything,disneys best songs,plot,humor,and characters!My 2 year old baby brother loves ariel and knows the words to her songs.This is definitly everybodys favorite disney movie!PLOTAriel is a 16 year old mermaid who loves anything and everything that has to do with humans.Her dad King Triton cant stand that one of his dauthers is in love with humans,and winds up doing something to Ariel that will change the course of thier lifes FOREVER!The little mermaid makes a deal with a sea witch that will change her into a human for three days,she has to kiss the human that she likes within the three days,Or else shell be ursulas forever!Note:Ursula might be to scary for younger kids BUT those certain parts can be fast foward.Bottom line A MASTERPIECE"
5,Childhood Revisted,The Little Mermaid DVD was great! I loved the documentary about Hans Christian Anderson and the deleted scenes. The best part of the DVD is the actual movie. I LOVE the Little Mermaid and it was great being able to have a DVD of it.
2,1 month still no movie!,"I purchased this movie 1 month ago & have not received it yet. My money was withdrawnfrom my account the next day, but still no movie! Will never buy a movie from this siteagain. Oh and I email the person and they never responded.Pissed Off Parent."
5,The Little Mermaid,"This is an excellant movie with a captivating and enchanting plot.The main character, Ariel, feels misunderstood by her family, so she goes to the sea witch as a last resort.She takes a chance and her dreams come true. I think that many young girls can relate to how Ariel feels in this movie.It's also a great adaption of the original book The Little Mermaid, wich has a very sad ending.I'm glad that Disney stuck to the main plot from the story though."
1,Disappointing,The DVD purchased was substandard. It was very blurry and distorted. Looked like a bootleg movie or one that had been poorly copied. This the first time I have been disappointed by an Amazon.com purchse.
1,Bootleg?,"I am pretty sure this is a bootleg- the label doesn't look authentic, and the quality of the recording is pretty poor. Not only are bootlegs illegal, but it was expensive. Throughouly disappointed in this seller and Amazon."
1,late late late,still waiting on a product that i ordered 9/3!! It is now 10/9! still haven't rec'd the product. very dissapointed
2,"Some great songs, but what a sexist message!","Sure, the animation is beautiful and some of the songs are terrific (""Under the Sea"" and ""Kiss the Girl"" are the best, I think), but don't any other parents have a problem with this film and the message it sends? A young, spirited girl with a beautiful voice must ABANDON her IDENTITY (or the two most important parts of it: her identity as a mermaid and her precious voice) in order to get a man (a prince, of course). After a series of struggles this supposedly modern heroine triumphs how? By getting the guy and sailing off into the sunset, even though we've been told at the beginnin that she's only 16. My 2 year old daughter loves the images and the songs, so we'll watch it occasionally, but I wish Disney would make a few female characters that have more on their minds than giving up freedom for marriage. We need more Mulans!"
2,Regional Restriction for viewing in Australian DVD player,There is apparently a Regional Restriction for viewing the DVD in Australian DVD player. So we were unable to view the DVD on our DVD player. It would nice that when we purchase the DVD that Amazon.com would tell us that there would be restrictions in viewing the DVD in Australia and restrict us in continuing with the purchase.
1,Copy,"This item was purchased Nov 2010 as a gift for my newborn grand daughter. Well it was opened today, Dec 6th 2011 because she is finally old enough to watch. Well upon opening this item the cardboard container was very grainy and dull and when the actual plastic contaner was opened the disc were chipped and scratched. It was obvious that this was a very poorly made copy and not an origanal NEW product as stated when I purchased it. I realize it has been over a year and there is nothing I can do about it but I did trust that this item was NEW so I wasnt concerned about it being FAKE. Anyway, VERY VERY unhappy with this purchase."
1,DVD Skips,The first time I watched the movie it skipped in a certain area. I thought it may be the DVD player. The second time I watched the movie it skipped at the same time in the movie as the first time. I'm not satisfied.
2,Too scary for all my children,"I ordered this DVD from Netflix and we played it twice. All in family concluded that they didn't want to watch it again. This is from a 2 1/2 year old girl, a 4 1/2 year boy and a 10 year old girl. My girls love many of the songs we play from YouTube, like ""Part of Your World"", but the evil enchantress and the sharks that ""kill"" make it all too scary for them. My kids have 100's of DVDs, and preferred titles are: Angelina Ballerina, Ratatouille, Cars, Baby Enstein box set, Teletubbies, Rescue Hero, Alphabet Train, Dora the Explorer, Bob the Builder, Maisy, Kipper, Mickey Mouse (not all the old ones though), Winnie the Pooh Friendship series DVDs, Heffalump Movie, and Wiggles Big Red Car to name the favorites. Wish there was an option to select and play ""preschool"" edition minus all the scary parts. Even our 10 year old thought too scary, and said Cinderella was the only one that doesn't scare her of all the Disney movies."
4,mermaid review,received - mild problem with the disc. Seems fine now. Ordered two discs at the same time - Little Mermaid and also Aladdin from two different sellers - one came .50 postage due - WTF? Not sure if it was Scott Weinger or Jodi Benson - beware.
4,Disney,The DVD was delivered in wonderful time and looked brand new. There is one glitch during the video in which the picture freezes but for the most part the video is in great condition.
5,Wonderful Movie,"I purchased this movie for our 2yr old daughter. She loves it! She now calls herself ""Princess Ariel"" and her Daddy is Prince Eric. How cute! It bothers my Husband that Ariel openly defies her father. So we point out that Ariel is very naughty for not listening to her Father. Oh, and I always have to be Ursula! Not sure how I feel about that! I would recommend it. It seems to be one of the few actually good movies for young kids out there that doesn't have some political message hidden in it. It is just good entertainment for little ones and the music is fun!"
4,The Victim,"A contracted mafia hit, a murdered police officer, Young Matt Payne, Inspector Peter Wohl...W.E.B. Griffin continues to keep my interest in the Badge of Honor series. Book III seemed fast-paced enough for me. As with other installments in his series, things are never ""wrapped up"" with the end of the book. Everything is more along the line of ""to be continued,"" which for Griffin fans, is what we have come to expect. On to Book IV, The Witness."
4,Great storytelling!,"No one can tell a story like Griffin, and no one can develop characters like him either. By this time (the third book in the Badge of Honour series), we are getting to know the main characters a lot better. This book gives us a fascinating look at the Mob and its interaction with local police departments. There's a lot of politics in this book, but I think that is a daily fact of life with police departments, and the book shows the give and take of this relationship. I need to read the next book in order to find out what happens with the characters. That is what Griffin does to me - he hooks me with his characters. I get to feel that I know them all. What new scrapes is Matt Payne going to get into, and what happens with Wohl's career? You will need to read these books to find out what I'm talking about. And they should be read in order."
1,The book was incredibly BORING!,"I can not believe that a publisher would even think of putting this book on the market. It was too descriptive, I wanted to know what happened and why. All it did was tell you about the people and the police offices. W.E.B. Griffin has done stuff 3 times better so why did he come out & write trash like this."
3,RE volunteer firefighters,"RE an earlier reviewer's example of volunteer fire departments... one of the reasons that cities professionalized their fire departments is that the volunteers were not always so helpful - they were paid by the value of what they saved, so competing teams would show up at the same fire, and end up fighting with each other for the prize while the building burned. Or they simply wouldn't bother with low-value fires. Firehouses of the period are interesting, culturally - kind of a men's clubhouse - precursor to fraternal lodges."
3,Not the best out there,"If you are looking for a book on veganism and disease, this book is OK but simply regurgitates excerpts from what the masters in this field already state in their books. Ms. Saunders credentials really do not lend to speaking in depth about disease. Dr. McDougall, Dr. Neal Bernard and Dr. Michael Klaper are all medical doctors who have written books and speak from their own professional medical practices and first hand knowledge of the subject. If you want my recommendation, I say go to the experts and read their books instead."
1,visited Dr Saunders after I attended her class,"I am a strength athlete and professional wrestler and I came to Dr Kerrie ready to try this diet out after her raving about it's benefits and numerous athletes that have broken records on it, along with some unusual symptoms I had (later atttributed to an pinched nerve) I have to say I gave the diet a fair shot and I noticed my testosterone dropped, weak, dizzy, several other problems along with weightloss, I consulted the books these ""athletes"" wrote and I have to say I was stunned to see most looked malnourished or took countless supplements and still did not seem proper. I apreciate people that do thrive on this diet but I have to say maybe I did not do it right, but it made me ill and it is one of my biggest regrets. Dr Kerrie is very nice and means well but left out key info about zinc...proper fatty acids and several other things vital to man my size and age."
4,"More a way of life than a diet, really","This book is really good. It goes into depth, really, about all matters concerning a healthy lifestyle, really. I really recommend it."
2,I wouldn't bother with it,"I didn't care for it at all. I don't know where the author gets her old information. She seems to babble. Not an easy read.I notice through a little light research that if the author doesn't like your review, she will get a family member todebate. easily found out. HA! I find other reading digestable. Still, I don't like her book , I have read many, and I wouldn't recommend it. Enough said."
3,Good resource,"This is a well referenced resource for anyone wishing to make an informed decision about living a healthy veg lifestyle.Plenty of information sourced from reliable research and researchers.Just about every health condition you can think of is covered.I think it could have been framed in a more positive tone, as the focus on disease is a bit of a downer, that being said, if you are in the nutrition / health / wellness industry it is a valauble read.Andrew FenwickHealth and Total Wellness ConsultantNewcastle Australia"
4,A great book if you want to be a professional programmer,"There is no doubt, this is a good book. In my opinion it focuses on the right aspects of programming and it does it in a concise and enjoyable way, and even better it does it on about 250 pages only. So, in fact I can manage to read it during hectic working days, not just buy it and decorate my bookshelf with it. I would recommend it to any beginner who wants to turn into a professional programmer. For the professionals who have been in the game for some years, it works very well as a reminder of what we should focus on to stay professionals. However, I feel it lacks something on how to handle really big software systems. But, together with the books by Steve Maguire and The Mythical Man-Month by Frederick Brooks, I would say you have a very good ballast as a professional programmer."
4,very helpful,"This book helped me get beyond individual languages, op systems, and tools, into the heart of programming.It's about solving problems and about getting clear on what I am doing before I start pounding the keyboard.The sections about specific languages are useful, but not nearly as interesting as the general topics.The sections on debugging are specially helpful."
5,The practice of Programming,This is a classic text from one of the founding fathers of programming. Easy to read and easy to follow.
5,If you buy one CS book this is it.,"This is the most readable computer science book you will ever encounter. Not really a reference, but more a generalized understanding of why we do some of the things we do in the software engineering field. The perspective this book gives you will make you a better programmer for any language."
2,Other choices are better,"This book would have been fine 10 years ago. However, the topics covered here are better covered elsewhere, by other authors (Code Complete and The Pragmatic Programmer). There's very little in this book that is not covered in the other books, and combined, they covered more areas better.In short: Better value can be found elsewhere."
1,A waste of time,"This book would be great if you want a review of what state-of-the-art programming in the 70's was like -- the Java snippets (which look like they were added as an afterthought) not withstanding. The book's coverage is as moldy as the many C language examples it presents (come to think of it, the only good I got from this book was a refresher in how badly designed C was).If you want a real ""Practice of Programming"" book read McConnell's Code Complete."
1,Doesn't go beyond the basics,"I really wanted to see more on software engineering, testing tools, etc. I think this book, if done well, would have been a huge tome. Instead, it is not a very insightful book for an experienced programmer. While it would be very useful for a novice or intermediate programmer, I'd have to recommend Code Complete over this one."
3,Too aged,"I wouldn't say this book is plain bad. It just feels aged in a 1970s kind of way, which is weird for a book released in 1999. The style is pretty particular to C and the Unix command line environment. It tries to take on a huge subject, but unfortunately it's quite short and lacks both depth and breadth.There is good advice in it, but the subject is much better dealt with by other books:Code CompleteThe Pragmatic ProgrammerProgramming PearlsIf you read those (which I highly recommend), this book sadly won't bring you anything new of value."
4,"Worth the money, but problems.","I found the book enjoyable. Best parts are stories of the old days, and some good chunks of code. Bad things: 1. Apparently written to ""cash-in"" on trendy lore-of-programming books (""Code Complete"" etc.). 2. Chapters end with exercises that *aren't answered*. Even on their web page; some are obviously speculative but some clearly have correct answers which I thought I was paying-for when I bought the book. 3. So I'm stupid: the Markov chain chapters left me confused about the algorithm itself. 4. The C++ Java ""interface"" etc. stuff seems tacked-on to a basically C-language orientation (see #1 above). There is virtually *no* treatment of GUIs. This could be a plus of course.But I still enjoyed the book...."
3,"For new coders a five star, for old timers a one.",If you've been around the block a couple of times don't waste your time. If however you are new and would like to see what's in this field do read carefully for the book contains many gems. Well written and carefully prepared.
3,Reasonably well-done but nothing new,"If you have not read Steve McConnell's books this book is worth reading. The supplementary reading lists at the end of each chapter are valuable (again, if you have not already read the material cited). I was disappointed in the lack of new material and/or fresh perspective on older material. Read McConnell, Stroustrup, Lakos, Gamma et al, and Scott Meyers and skip this one"
4,Snappy Reading and Excellent Advice with One Shortcoming.,"Hi,This book is great for programming style and clarity but there is a glaring flaw: The authors have a bad case of six (or eight) letteritus when it comes to variable names. Even though they advocate readable names for globals and functions, they still change ""procedure"" to ""proc"", ""SIZE"" to ""SIZ"" and ""buffer"" to ""buf"".Other than that it is a good book."
2,Out of focus,"Sometimes even the greatest masters make minor works. Brian Kernighan is a master. And this book is a minor work. Why? Take a look at the TOC. It refers to, at least, 5 complicated topics wich deserve nothing less than a single book each one. How can someone cover decently them all in just one 267 pages book? Once you finish each chapter remains the feeling that it was just a glimpse, far from a good explanation.It's certainly an above the average book. The authors know what they are talking about. But you would be much better served by the suplementary reading at the end of each chapter. At least, they sugest you the really good books.This is also an Unix biased book. Kernighan and Pike don't like interactive debuggers. And they don't care too much about user interface. If you are on the Windows/Mac/Palm/etc side of programming, you'll probably see things a little diferently."
2,incredibly slow shipping,"took 3 weeks for my item to arrive. bought it for my brother's birthday, he didn't get it until 2 weeks after it already passed"
1,Shirt Damaged,I bought this shirt as a gift for someone and received it with two holes right in the front center of it. Extremely disappointed in this purchase and will be returning it.
1,DESIGN COMPLETELY FADED UPON OPENING,"I have a Dunder Mifflin shirt...Michael Scott's fun run. So I bought this, thinking it would be the same quality. As soon as I took it out of the envelope I noticed that the logo design, which is the whole reason you buy shirts like these, was completely faded and horrible looking. It looks like the rollers didn't have enough paint on them or something. I sent the shirt back as soon as I opened it. Big disappointment, as I was planning on wearing this to a party tomorrow. I am surprised that someone would even package this to ship to a customer, as it is obvious it is defective. Now that I think about it, I think they put a ""distressed logo"" shirt in the envelope instead of the regular one, which is the one I bought. Not being a fan of distressed anything, I am sending it back."
5,"Thoroughly researched, clear interlaced theme of ecotourism","Thoroughly researched pulling no punches on the issues affecting Honduras' fastest growing economic sector: eco/ethnoconscious tourism. This book ties together the myriad disparate ecological, private, non-governmental, and governmental groups involved in establishing green havens of fast-disappearing biological treasures, including their successes, failures and hopes for the future. ""Ecotourism"", a relatively new concept and term often used in an almost generic way now by the tourism industry, is thoroughly explored and is interlaced as a theme throughout this exemplary work. We may only hope that other guide-book publishers are paying attention to this model as travelers are now demanding much more than just the mundane where to eat, sleep and catch a bus."
5,I love A1,"Not bcuz I'm a real x 1000 A1 fan, so I say their music are g8. They might have kinda...compied Ah-Ha's music but they made it more morden and better. Ah-Ha could not hit high notes but in A1 series, Ben could actually do it. I think its really really really fab!"
5,So far so good,I bought this item after my kids left my other crock pot on all night and the fire dept had to be called. I've used it twice since I bought it and I absolutely love the fact that it turns itself to warm. I have no problems with the cover and as far as it heating too fast I haven't found that issue to be a problem as of yet either. I do not like the fact that the handle gets as hot as it does on the lid though.
3,It's not the best,"I purchased this product for the convience factor of being able to set the time and temperature. I ran into a problem when I wanted to cook something on low for 4 hours and leave it be. You are unable to do that with this crockpot. You can only cook on high only,for 2 or 4 hours and on low only, for 6 and 8 hours. If these are your normal settings you use to cook - it's wonderful!! After your cooking time has been completed it turns it to a warm setting so that it doesn't overcook. If you are looing for something more versatile check out the progammable crockpot also by Rival."
3,"Decent, but for the price could be better","We use this for soup every day. The price seemed right and the removeable crock is something that we can't do without. We have only had it about 2 months and the plastic handle on the lid is already beginning to crack. The lid isn't abused, but I would expect to get more than 2 months wear out of this.On the plus side, I think that the little dipper is a great idea. Good thing you can purchase it separately."
2,DON'T BUY - Hairline crack appeared in the removeable pot,"I received this crockpot as a gift and have only used it three times. I just used it for a large party because the size is great. However after pulling out the removable pot to wash it, I noticed a small portion of burnt food in the bottom of the unit and after washing the removable pot I could see a hairline crack in the porceline. The Product warranty requires me to send it to them postage paid by me as well as the return postage. I have no idea when I will get this product back from them during the holiday season as well as how much I had to invest in postage."
2,I got this as a second crockpot for an earily Christmas gift,"It has some nifty options such as warm auto setting after cooking but other then that it makes me want to go get another one like I have or large the oval older style one. I had never been so disappointed in the cooking with a crockpot, it cooks way to fast. I am not sure if the heating element was right out of the box. The liquid did not stay inside the pot when I tried it so I would say not to buy it if you make liquid necessary dishes. Then the lid has a tendency to lift off the crock and hot liquid pops out. Be careful for adults and keep this far from even older children if you notice this! I would never leave this unattended nor use it overnight because it clanks while cooking. This is because it has a light weight glass lid with metal ring around, when it lifts up with the building steam, even on low setting, it can make rather loud clanks."
2,Cooks at too high a temperature,"I got this crockpot thinking the ""warm"" feature would be great if I was gone for more than 8 hours. Well, every recipe I have done in there is ready in five hours or less on LOW! I have tried adding more liquid with no success. I would hate to think what the high setting would do. In addition, you can't just switch it to ""warm"" by yourself, which I would love to do since with this pot everything I put in at 9am is done by 2! With two young children, I love crockpot cooking, but I'm not ready to eat at 2 in the afternoon."
1,Burnt food,"I am dissatified with the purchase of this crockpot. The handle on the lid burns your fingers. Not to mention this pot cooks entirely too hot even on the low setting. I purchased this in March and every time I have used it, the food burns and sticks to the sides. All the water evaporates and boils over. Which is quite shocking since the instructions say liquids don't boil away.I've contacted Rival and the only comment they had that they were re-designing the lid with a plastic more customer friendly handle. I was also told by Rival in the future to use a pot hold to avoid injury. They have yet to respond to the issue of the crockpot cooking to hot. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's a shame because the design it much nicer than the older versions."
2,Not the best choice...,"I was so excited to purchase this crockpot, the thought of it turning off was great! HOWEVER, it has not been a good product, and after only 3 months of use, I am calling it quits! It cooks way too fast, the ""low"" seems to actually be more like ""high"". The lid does not seal well, so it steams and pops all through cooking. The handle on the lid gets so hot, it can cause a burn. Don't waste your money, my last crockpot may not have been ""smart"" but it lasted 10 years!"
1,A waste of money,"I bought this unit to replace my worn but true Pifco model# 4852. I could not have picked a worse Item blind folded. Not only is this aberration shoddily assembled, it cooks waaaay too hot. I will replace this thing as soon as I find a different model here in Kuwait, or hopefully find a replacement lid for my Pifco."
2,Buy something else,"I've only had this for a month and already thinking of taking it back. While I love the size, the attractiveness, the free little dipper, the warm setting, and the glass top, I don't like the fact that the lid handle gets too hot to handle, the settings are limited to 4 and you can't just program in your own time. Plus, I made a pot roast in it and, even after washing it, see some slight stains probably from the wine I used. The little dipper is a nice addition but it takes too long to warm up stuff and when it finally does, it gets way too hot and you have to constantly unplug it. If it had a switch or 2 settings, it would be ideal...but it doesn't. I'd look for another product out there...doesn't sound like many people liked this one either."
2,Too hot,"Rival had a great idea with this one (the programmable feature), but like many people have mentioned, it cooks way too hot for anyone who is gone for several hours. 8 hours on low = burned, nasty food.I hate mine. Do they even test these products before they market them?I have had several Rival pots. They all realistically have two settings: burned and off."
2,Temperatures either too hot or too cold,I previously had a slow cooker that allowed me to adjust my settings in a range of 1-5 (wish I could find another one!). This cooker is too hot on high and too cold on low for what I like to cook. Also I agree with the person who mentioned the staining. The material used in the bowl seems to stain more than others I have had.I'm looking to replace it and my favorite thrift shop will get it.
1,Waste of money!,I have wasted my money buying this crockpot. I have owned a Rival crockpot previously and liked it.<br />This one cooks far too hot and the ceramic insert also stains badly.<br />I will be buying a new crockpot but it probably won't be a Rival.<br />Don't waste your money on this one.
2,Poor Quality,"I received this item as a shower gift. For the first two years it worked great. However, over the past two months I have spent about $50 on roasts that were overcooked and as hard as a brick. At first Ithought it was the cut of the roast, but now I have discovered that crock pot no longer cooks on low."
3,"Worked Well, but Plastic Handle Broke",This crock pot always cooked well for me. I agree it is hotter than others. My main complaint was that the handles are made of cheap plastic and could not withstand the weight of a full roast. They are also designed in a way that it is not possible to repair the handle only. The screws dropped inside the unit rendering it useless to me.
1,don't buy,"I AGREE WITH THE OTHERS,IT HAS BURNED EVERYTHING I HAVE COOKED.COOKS WAY TO FAST..DO NOT BUY..."
2,It tends to burn,This product tends to burn food if you leave it over night or leave for the day. Must have a lot of liquid to work well. The sets seem to be to hot.
1,Burn Baby Burn,"I purchased this particular crockpot because of the large capacity and the automatic shut off feature. Unfortunately, EVERYTHING I cooked in it burned. It was awful. I tried several different types of food and recipes and it did not matter, everything burned. If a recipe called for 6 to 8 hours on low, it would be burnt at 4 hours. My old crockpot does not do this. My old crockpot is the exact same brand. I was very dissapointed with this crockpot."
2,Flaws in this cooker,"I bought this crock pot about 3 years ago. It was fine for about the first year, or about 12 times used. Then the handles on the side started cracking and before I knew it one completely broke off in my hand. I actually ended up dropping the thing on my foot! Anyway, I wrote the company to let them know and to request repairs or a replacement. I was told that I could ship it and pay for repairs. I didn't think this was very good of them, so I decided to trash the unit. I agree with other customers in that it seems to cook at a higher temp. than needed. The low setting is really a medium and the high is SCORCHING high! Overall it's not a good unit. The built-in timer is great although there really is not a ""warm"" button which would have been helpful for warming and not cooking. The warm setting only comes on after its elapsed time is us. I would not recommend this item."
1,Bad handles .. stay away from this!,"I don't understand, Rival is a great name, but the cheap handles on this are just terrible!First, the handle on the lid is not a &quot;stay cool&quot; handle and there is no warning, when you lift it it burns your hand. It is very hot!!Second, the side Handles cracked upon using this the first time. THE FIRST TIME! I am returning this to Target.. Sorry but I don't think Handles should crack on the first use.Third, it is a shame,, it is a great pot! Cooked very well and I love the programmable part of thisBut, what good is a great pot when the handles are so bad... Very disapointing... Rival.. Hope you read this!"
2,"It's okay, but...","The big problem was that I didn't like ""Spinner"" and this CD seems like its half spinner edits. But I did like ""Saint Tom"" and I REALLY like ""Strawinsky"". Something to ponder over: does Strawinsky use the open (aka No Pussyfooting) looper? I think it does. Oh well..."
4,A doctor's view of a people he loved..,"This is a wonderful view of China over 40 years by a physician who loved it. There are some realistic descriptions of the life, his involvement with his patients, and unlike some of the missionary letters, it's a view that is not filtered through only the American viewpoint. Organization is sometimes difficult to follow, and the timeline skips around at times. Still very readable, and enjoyable."
4,Great for the price,"This Hitachi VCR is nice looking. It is average at fast fowarding and rewinding. It is wider than most VCR's, but that is not a problem. It does not make that much noise at all. There are very little buttons on the VCR, which is good because it is simple. The remote control for the VCR is okay and easy to use. Setting the clock etc is not that hard to do.If you are looking for a cheap, nice looking and good working VCR, buy this one."
2,Returning this item.,I purchased this through Amazon.[com] It doesn't play all my NTSC tapes. The old vcr which it replaced actually plays better once I cleaned its heads and blew out the dust inside with a can of air.I'm going to return it for something better. I hope I can still do this without the packaging.
2,disappointed,"I got into the storyline in the beginning. Once I figured out the plot twists, I had to force myself to keep reading. I think it would have been better if it wasn't so long."
3,Not Bad! Worth Reading,"This was a good read. Lots of characters that made the story interesting, and never boring.I enjoyed the romance, and just when you thought you knew the bad guy it changed. Really kept me guessing right up to the end. I do recommend this book."
1,A Complete Dud....,"I can't believe I'm writing this about one of Nora Robert's books, but this novel was awful. It started out boring but I stuck with it hoping it would become interesting, but it never did. The characters and the plot were flat. Sorry, but this one's definitely not a keeper."
3,Entertaining but VERY predictable,You know the end from the very beginning. It is entertaining though.
3,Great story and plot but.....,"This is the first Nora Roberts book for me and I enjoyed the story line very much. She spent alot of time on character depth and it was truly a ""whodunnit"" but I have to say the heavy romantic scenes where actually distracting and almost gratuitous. After reading some of the book, I wondered why Fabio wasn't on the cover. Ms. Roberts needs to decide if she wants to be a Romance Writer or a Mystery Writer. I hope she decides on Mystery full time, she is a great writer."
3,My First Nora Robert's book...,"...and probably my last. The book was pretty good, don't get me wrong, it's just that I felt kinda slimed after reading it, hard to explain. It's a fairly shallow book written in a rather simplistic style. It's a good ""sit by the pool with a drink or two or three"" book."
5,great,GREAT book - read on the Kindle of course - No additional words should be required to describe the book
3,Gift that went over well,"Got this as a gift, it apparently was an interesting read and the ""giftee"" thoroughly enjoyed it. She loves Nora Roberts books and thought this was great."
4,"Good, but I've read better",Not Nora's best but definately worth a read. I really liked the mystery. The characters were good but there were too many of them so none of them really had too much depth.A good leisure read but not as good as her trilogies. those are the ones I would recommend.
1,Long and Dull,"I wasted most of the summer slogging through this book, and considered not finishing it at all. I'd put it down and it'd take me a week or two to get back to it. The story was drawn out too long and I couldn't warm up to any of the characters, even those that were supposed to be the protagonists. Eve Benedict was a manipulative user and not someone I could care about. (But then that's my opinion of most Hollywood types, past and present.) The climax of this story seemed foolish and I was hoping for a different twist on ""whodunnit"". Oh well... I hope Ms. Roberts'other books I've purchased and have yet to read won't prove to be such duds."
2,Blah,"This is so far one of the most boring Nora Roberts books, ever. It was OK but it seriously was a PUSH to get through it, and usually I simply just fly through her novels. The characters are very flat and uninvolved. I was able to guess whodunit way before the act was even done, as well as guess some of the plot twists. The book was fun for the trip to Hollywood-land but besides that it was a LONG book (528 pages) that really would have been better off slimmed down. Lots ado about nothing which leads to boring repeat events and pointless happenings that in the end you discover served no purpose at all to the story.If you are a NR fan, you may like it but I suggest perhaps finding another novel to read first and borrow this one from a friend."
4,Delicious,"I devoured this book in one setting. It's suspenseful and engaging, as you find out all kinds of tidbits from a Hollywood star's life. Picture being able to follow Joan Crawford or Bette Davis around, finding out all the secrets they hold about Hollywood actresses, writers and dirctors, their kinky habits and glamourous lives. That's what Nora Roberts does in this novel -- she creates that world for you.My only gripe with the novel (and reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars) is that I was able to predict the killer, and I'm not fond of how the book ended. Still, the romance was lovely (as expected from any Roberts book) and the Hollywood backround fabulous!"
2,Poor,"This book is too long and too melodramatic. I also take issue with the theories put forth. For example, the notion that a woman who has an affair with a married man is justified..even glorified...because it's 'love'. Tawdry behavior and lousy morals espoused in silly dialog do not make for a good book. If you're going to digest low morals, irresponsibility and so forth, at least do yourself the favor of reading it in a witty , intelligent, and sophisticated context."
4,Venezia Millefiori Watch,"Nice watch, tells precise time and garners a lot of positive comments.As a result we have purchased several more as gifts."
5,"Original, honest, true to life, and uproariously funny!","I had the pleasure of seeing this comedian in Florida. He is by far the funniest I have ever seen. His original banter on marriage, men and women, and life left me in stiches. His spirited take on relationships is enlightening and on target. I cackled with delight. His comedy is distinctive and bold. I couldn't stop laughing! You won't find a better comedian today."
5,Hilarious,Steve McGrew is something else! He's got a thread of good ol' American common sense running through his ideas that gives his work just that final little oomph needed to step it up from funny to on-the-ball hilarious. Worth your money! I want more work from this guy!
2,great text lost in a poorly-designed book,"I think the thing that amazes me the most about this book is how poorly designed and organized it is given the cost of the book. The illustrations look like they were scribbled on scraps of paper, the black and white photographs are dark and murky and the whole thing is laid out with only minimal organization which is really a shame because there is a great deal of very useful and comprehensive information here providing you can actually find what you are looking for -- the Table of Contents is at the ->back<- of the book under the heading ""Index;"" there is, needles to say, no index per se. Ms Conner should seriously consider either finding another publisher for her book or persuading her current publisher to hire both a graphic artist and an editor with experience in creating crafts books in the event that she writes a revised edition."
2,Informative text ruined by poor illustration,I am amazed that such great text came with such awful illustrations that I can only describe as scribblings. Some being so bad that they made me mad trying to comprehend their directions especially in the seed bead category.
5,Just love this book,I had borrowed this book originally at the library and knew I needed to buy it. For someone just beginning beading this has so much information.There are some typos and other issues but as a beading book this is invaluable!
2,Uninspiring,I got this book probaly about ten years ago. It does not give enough information on any one technique to really allow you to feel a sense of confidence and did not really do anything to really make me feel inspired. I did one earing technique out of the book and quickly got bored with that.
5,The Best Beading Book,"This is a wonderful little book. The black and white illustrations may seem simplistic, but they are complete in their information. This book covers everything a person needs to know about beading, from beginner to more advanced techniques. I recommend it highly!"
1,Bad Recording!,"Although the performance is very good, the recording is defective. We received two copies, both of which had blank segments in the middle of selections, including Widor's Toccata and Fugue. Buy another label!"
5,Jaconet hair nets,"These hair nets are very hard to find. My Mom has been looking for them for months, unsuccessfully. I got great ""daughter points"" for finding and getting them delivered. These hair nets are exactly like the ones she has previously used (a huge accomplishment)A great purchase"
1,1,I order a book and I got it it was not good. all over the book was writing by pen most of the page are ripped.it was horrible.
1,Not artistically representing for having too many translated,"Disappointing since 1/3 of the book is dedicated to foreign authors' translated versions. In the sense of making an anthology of super-short, the selection might come directly from original English instead of any translated, seemingly storytelling-only stories since the brightness of diction is far more important than a ""short-short"" story itself."
2,odd collection,"One feels after finishing many of these 38 very short pieces that they are ultimately mystery stories, not as in, Whodunnit?, but as in ""What the hell just happened?"" The editors, Irving and Ilana Howe, have a special fondness for ambiguity. All of the authors are world class, but with occasional exception the stories are not so well-known. My favorite effort was Doris Lessing's Homage for Isaac Babel, so I was disappointed to find that the actual Isaac Babel story in the collection--The Death of Dolgushov--didn't do much for me. Overall, a few hits, a few misses, and a lot of head-scratchers."
1,Horrible collection if you like stories with endings,"It's not often that I find a book that would make me want to strangle someone for a waste of time, but this one and Briefing for a Descent Into Hell do that for me. I will admit it: I have no taste for modern literature that is supposed to be just ""setting a tone"" or whatever narcissistic excuse for self indulgence is currently popular. I want stories with a beginning, a middle and an end. Just because these are ultra short, doesn't mean you have to give those up. Too often, the scene is set and then goes nowhere, an absolute frustration for me. Maybe some people see it as art, but I don't."
3,Mixed bag,"Some good stuff in here but a lot of translations with too much focus, I thought, on Eastern European authors and works from the early 1900's. I was expecting better selections or more modern selections."
5,An Amazing Book,"This is the first Gwen Bristow novel I've ever read. Her historical fiction is wonderful. This is the first of her plantation trilogy, set in what becomes Louisiana, prior to the American Revolution. It follows the Larne and Sheramy families, telling how they carved their empires out of the forests. It's a great love story, a great historical novel, and my favorite of the trilogy."
1,Really?,"Wow. My wife, pre-teen-age son, and I rented this movie based on the positive reviews here. We were very dissapointed. I love good indie films, but with ""Gerald,"" the acting and writing seemed to match the film's low budget. The main premise of the movie required greater than normal suspension of disbelief; that's fine, but pulling that off requires top-notch writing and acting. I didn't think the man who played Gerald was believable as a mentaly impaired man, as his acting was 100% evident at all times and seemed to draw upon nothing but cliches and stereotypes (no Rain Man here, not even close). The characters of the lush and the transvestite were so cartoonish and one-note that they both seemed to have escaped a mid '90s Saturday Night Live skit. We had to give up on this movie after a half hour or so and there were zero laughs among the three of us during that time."
5,Children/visual Impairments,"Excellent, informative book. I bought it for my grandson & mate who recently gave birth to my great-grandson, born with cataracts. I read most of it before sending to them. Very useful to those of us with no knowledge of this impairment."
5,Nice Book,"I haven't had a chance to read this thoroughly, but when I skimmed through it I liked what I saw!! It seems like it will have a lot of good information! Can't wait until I have time to actually read it!! One of the better ""guide for parents"" books I have found!!"
3,"Great for pretend, not great as goggles","My kids LOVE this goggle/flipper set. My 5yo was a little angry he couldn't run in them till I pointed out he just had to change how he was running to his the ground heel first hehe. For them to stay sealed as goggles I think would only work on a bigger kid. This is probably ideal for a 7-8yo, but it's fun for dress up and playing around with face above water for my 3yo and 5yo."
1,Sharkman Deluxe Disappointment,It only took about ten minutes for us to realize this dive set was a complete waste of [$$$]. The fins don't stay positioned on the feet and the fin on the headpiece causes it to move and unseal the goggles. I strongly recommend against purchasing this product.
5,Always an intriguing read.,"Although this was not my favorite of Gardner's, I have never read one of his books that I regretted the value of the purchase. Like all of his Perry Mason books, this one keeps your brain churning until the very end, and then fills in a lot of blanks all at once. Although I did not look at the publication date, it appeared to be one of his earlier novels--not as polished as most--but it is always a good read for fans familiar with and devoted to his works and his cast of characters. I enjoy them because they are not excessively long, and yet are always intriguing. Great diversions from the complexities of everyday life. I anxiously look for more to become available in Kindle format, and already own those that are!"
3,Not one of Gardner's best efforts.,"Not one of Gardner's best efforts. The muddled contradictory testimony of one of the main characters, who was introduced after the free Kindle sample by the way, gives this story a three star rating at best. The typos and proofing errors that infiltrate these Kindle versions were, however not as serious an issue as in previously read Perry Mason Kindles. I remain, however, a Perry Mason/Kindle fan."
2,Poor quality,The light is very low when it decides to turn on. It took four nights of sitting in the sun before it even glimmered. And when it did light up it was extremely low. I hate that I am pass the 30 day return date. My suggestion is to choose a better quality solar light.
1,Stops working after less than a year,"The first unit I bought lasted only 7 months. But I liked the concept so I bought a replacement, which lasted 6 months. Lesson learned: an expensive gimmick rather than a dependable solar light that will last for years."
2,Solar Motion Lights did not las a year,I wish I had good news to report. Great Consept really but it only lasted 10 months and quit working all together. Contacted the manufacture to let them know the screws that were on the back to get to batteries were stripped out and un able to remove back to replace batteries. They suggested to ship it back to them but the price to ship back to Canada I could purchase new. At this point I think I need to purchase something that will last a bit longer because I need it in a location that only a ladder can reach. Anyway would re think purchasing this one again!
4,Satisfied,"Like any LED based night light, this isn't incandescent bright, but it's bright enough to expose an otherwise totally dark area. Plus not having to hook it up to the home wiring makes this/these products hugely convenient, esp. in locations away from the house.This product worked exactly as expected/hoped plus is less expensive than other versions, which is good combination of factors."
1,Absolute garbage,"Yes, I saw the reviews. Yes, I believed that I, Mr. Amazon could magically make the light work for an extended period of time since I am an Electrical Engineer. Yes...I was completely wrong. I wasted my money. This light is a joke. Believe the reviews. You have been warned."
1,"After a few days, stopped working. Replacement was also defective","Great service from Amazon, as usual! However, this product is extremely unreliable. First unit stopped working after a few days and replacement unit failed after the first 2 hours. Ended up just getting my money back."
1,DO NOT BUY!!1,POOR CONSTRUCTION. FLIMSY SWITCH. HAD TO RETURN THE FIRST ONE AS IT NEVER WORKED OUT OF THE BOX. . THE REPLACEMENT QUIT WORKING AFTER THE FIRST RAIN IN LESS THAN A MONTH. DO NOT KNOW IF THERE IS A WARRANTY AT ALL TO THIS PRODUCT. STAY AWAY
1,Buyer Beware,Followed instructions but item did not work. I should have listened to the reviews! Good customer service on the refund though.
1,do not buy...,"out of 7 I have had after a month only 3 work...poor support from manufacture, no contact info I have to look it up and then call information for the phone number, the phone is not on box, website or manual...cheap junk....stay away...."
2,Is this healthy? Really?,"I guess I'm kind of a stickler for feeding my kitties ONLY food that I know is good for them *all* the time. There are several things in this book that are recommended by vets NOT to feed to your cats, such as processed cheese (not including cottage cheese). However, there are some neat things in there too, and the book does say, ""in moderation."" But, if you're a stickler like me, you could probably do better with the Whole Food Diet book. It depends on what you're after. Personally, I feel weird about feeding my kitties something that's bad for them even if it's once a year, and most of the recipes in this book are like that. If you feel okay with that occasional treat and don't worry easily, then this book is awesome!"
5,LOVED IT,"I actually bought this book as a gag .. to give to a friend whom is a fanatical cat lover. Boy was I wrong, the recepies are good, but so are others in this genre. What really caught me was the illustrations and the small stories in betwen, a tru feast for the eye .. and mind. It is worth every penny for any true cat lover out there."
1,Disappointing purchase...,"I got these because I was tired of fighting with hard plastic ice cube trays that don't want to let go of the ice cubes. This silicone product works better in that respect, as long as you completely fill each cavity you can easily push the cube half way out from the bottom and then remove it by grabbing it from the top. The cubes are deep enough that pushing them completely out from the bottom doesn't work.Unfortunately, there seems to be something about the silicone that leaves a residue on the ice cubes. Every time we've used them a layer of yukky stuff floats to the top of the drink. No amount of cleaning the trays seems to take care of the problem."
1,pathetic product,"Read all the bad reviews and I've had all their experiences. Hot setting should be renamed Burn. Low setting should be Hard Boil, and Warm should be Too HOT. This thing is useless as a slow cooker. Rival had to know they were putting a piece of crap in the market place because it is so bad. Rival should offer to replace all the units they put out there or else no one should buy another Rival product. So far I'm 0 for 2 on Rival products and don't intend to go of 0 for 3."
1,Ruined too many meals,"It seemed to work fine for about a year. Then about 5 meals in a row were way overcooked. Particularly bad with beef meals. Turned a nice piece of steak into rubber. We were wondering for a while if it was the recipe, the steak or what. Finally I found that it simply runs too hot Even on the low setting the food boils in the pot.We must have thrown out $75 worth of food before we caught on. Pay up for a better brand."
4,Good family meal cooker,I have had this crockpot for almost a year now. It has worked great for us. I like how you can program the time you want it to cook and when finished it converts to a keep warm mode. You also have the option of cooking on a lower setting and again when finished cooking it will keep the food warm.<br />The touch pad is a bit cheap feeling when you touch the buttons but I havent had any problems with it not working. I think for the money this is a good deal.<br />Its also very easy to clean!!!
1,Even the dog won't eat the food,"I am also an unhappy consumer. This crock pot has burnt at least half of the dishes I've ever tried to make. The last thing I burnt, just last night the neighbors dog wouldn't even eat it was so charred after being set on low. My husband made me promise not to get mad before he told me that it had burnt our steak. Obviously it has drawn my wrath before when it has ruined our dinner and he was scared of how I might react. I have to fill the crockpot completely with water to ensure that it doesn't burn what I'm cooking. This defeats the purpose of cooking because all that water takes the flavor out of the food. I can't tell you how much I'd recommend not wasting your money on this &quot;crap pot.&quot; In addition you'll have to attend anger management."
3,Not my favorite slow-cooker,"I have been using slow-cookers for over 20 years and this one is by far my least favorite. I have owned 3 different Rival's in the past and am very disappointed in this newer, ""modern"" model. I have had most of the problems listed in the other reviews: wobbling lid, leaking water, discolored water inside the warming unit, and it gets TOO hot, TOO fast. On the WARM setting I had a rolling boil in my soup!! I do see the potential for a dangerous situation using this crock-pot unattended."
3,Lid does not seal,"I have used ""crock pots"" for several years, and am disappointed with the performance of this one. The problem for me is that the lid does not seal, there are actually gaps present, allowing moisture to escape, leaving food dried out or soups with little liquid."
1,Don't believe the timer!,"I actually used two of these, and neither one worked. With the first one, I made stew, carefullly following the recipe that came with the crock pot. As instructed, I set it to cook for 10 hours. Luckily, I didn't leave home that day, because it was fully cooked in 3 hours.Figuring that the timer on that one was no good, I exchanged for another unit. This time I tried a pot roast, again carefully following their recipe, and set it to slow cook for 10 hours. This time, it was overcooked in three hours. Again, I stayed home and kept an eye on it. Who know what would have happened if I was away from home for the full cooking time- it certainly could have cooked away all the liquid and started burning. Also, the handle on the lid gets extremely hot- way too hot to handle without a pot holder. Stay away from this one!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS CROCKPOT,"Don't waste your time with this crockpot. I bought it and turned it on and the timer started smoking. I took it back and exchanged it for another, got home and that timer smoked. I went back and got a THIRD one and asked them to turn it on at the store and it smoked also. I was very disappointed because I liked the way it looked but its not worth the smell of burnt plastic."
1,awful,i have wanted a crockpot for a long time and this one was one of the cheaper ones i saw.i've read reviews about rival before but decided to go ahead and try it out.i really wish i would have kept my receipt and box!.the lid doesn't even fit and moves around most of the time making a bunch of noise and letting all the steam escape so all your liquid ends up being gone.the food is well done before the slow time is up. my chicken turns out SO dry and overcooked.
4,****Very Happy****,"I received this as a wedding present in June of '03. I waited quite a while before using it since it is only my husband and I. I did, however, use it many times over the holiday season when we were entertaining. I was very impressed with it. I use it all the time now. Easy to use if you read instructions, easy to clean. I think its great."
4,Works Well.,I received this as a wedding gift and I think it works well. It has never smoked. My only complaint is that when I try to cut recipes in half (it's only my husband and myself that I cook for) they burn when I put them in for the recommended time. I guess I will just have to experiment with shorter times.
2,Crickity Crock,"I couldn't agree more with the other review citing that the lid doesn't fit properly. It doesn't! I've been through 3 different lids/pots of this model, some better than others, but overall, the lid is cheap, doesn't fit well, and lets out a lot of steam. I've had to wrap the lid rim with aluminum foil to keep the steam inside the pot. Additionally, the low setting is way to high, even with it being filled 2/3 full. Love the look, hate the performance. Rival was no help either, with lackluster customer service. Look elsewhere."
1,Vendor decieving,"The crock-pot itself is GREAT! However, the vendor ""ohio_dealz"" did not send me a crock-pot with a hinge. Though, they did let me keep the crock-pot for free.This is the e-mail they sent me: ""I have just refunded your order. You can keep the pot. I will really appreciate it if you can leave me a positive feed back, with: ""Arrived on Time"" YES, ""Item as Described"" YES, and YES for ""Customer Service"".""I don't lie and purchased from this vendor because of all of the great reviews. Are they really great?"
1,HORRENDOUS!!,"This is the worst crock pot I have ever owned! It boils even on LOW! Upon contacting Rival it was my fault; so I then explained in detail how it burns everything, even using their OWN recipes; should not be left alone while at work, etc. They sent me a condesending letter about how it meets all the federal regulations and labels. One thing they pointed out that I was unaware of - High on their cooker is 350 degrees. I don't know what kind of cooks they have working there but 350 degrees is a regular oven temperature NOT SLOW COOKING!"
1,Way too Hot!,"Like others have said, this cooker is MUCH too hot. My model has a low setting, but even after an hour or two the food was boiling. Even after the appliance switches to ""warm"" the food continues to simmer rapidly. I've made several dishes in this thing, from stuffed chicken to beef stew, and only one recipe came out decent (corned beef). I plan to replace this one for a smaller unit. Even 2/3 full, which is A LOT of food - even for leftovers - everything burns and has an off flavor. The final straw came when I used the Duet insert to make oatmeal. I woke up to a sticky, brown, burnt, gooey blob. I've had it with this product."
1,Hate it,My reasons are similar to everyone elses. Even when 2/3 full this thing will boil your dinner. What good is thr programmable feature if all the settings are just too hot? Definitely do not leave home when this thing is on as it is like playing russian roulette as to when it will burn the food.
2,Too Hot,"The heat setting on the Rival seems to be a lot higher than other models I've used. I used to be able to leave the slow cooker all day and it would be fine. The Rival burns my meals, cooks all the water out of my soups, and cannot be trusted to be left on all day. I'm very unhappy with it."
1,Cooker From He__!!,"Wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this insane appliance. Nothing ""slow"" about it-- burns everything, even on the Keep Warm setting. Best you can get out of it is 4 hours before you absolutely have to return home and shut it off. If not, your evening meal is small burnt pieces of food welded to the bottom of the pot. I swear, this thing is possessed! My old Rival Crock Pot was the best appliance I ever purchased, this one is the WORST!"
2,Dangerous Lid Design,"The lid on this crock pot is not designed with enough weight to keep the pressure in the pot. As this crock pot begins to build up heat, the lid begins to jump. As time progresses, and condensation begins to accumulate inside the lid and pot, hot water is splashed out of the pot with each jump of the lid. The first time I used this new crock pot, I returned home to find my cabinet top standing in water and the lid still jumping. I have since stayed home when I use the pot in order to try different settings but have experienced the same problem regardless of which setting I choose."
3,I NEED A FACEPLATE,"ITEM WORKED O.K. BUT FACEPLATE MALFUNCTIONED AND I CANNOT GET SUPPORT. IF YOU HAVE ONE, LET ME KNOW. WHY DOES KOSS HAVE SO MANY MODELS AND WHY DO THEY DROP GOOD FEATURES FOR NOT SO GOOD ONES?"
4,Ryan Liszkiewicz 2/25/05 Star Wars Episode 2,"I gave this book four stars because it was too focused around Anakin. The plot in this book is that Anakin must protect Padme while Obi-Wan looks for the Assasin thats trying to kill Padme. Then a war brakes out between Dooku's CIS droids and the Republic's Clones. The main conflict is that Anakin's mom dies and he gets so angry that he starts turning to the dark side. Anakin and Padme get married in secrecy. When the book ends, the Clone Wars are still being fought."
5,Better than the movie?,"Yes! Then again most books are! But if your a big Star wars fan then this is a must read. This book will take you deeper into the story of the man/machine Anakin. As Salvatore wrote me when he signed my book refering to this story, ""A glimpse into the shadows of his soul."" Indeed!"
4,Much more depth than the movie,"I really enjoyed this book, despite having seen the movie a few times already. The book provided a lot more information that there was in the movie.There was a lot more depth to both the plot and the characters, including a look at Shmi's life with the Lars family and her abduction by the Tusken Raiders, and the failed attempts to rescue her, also the love story between Annakin and Padme is developed much better so it actually seems they have a real basis for their feelings for each other. We also get to meet Padme's family and are able to see her much more as a person than just a political figure.These and a few others are the reasons to read the book. Everything else follows pretty directly with the movie, but there is enough extra information in the story to make the book well worth reading for Star Wars fans. I look foward to Episode III, both the book and movie."
5,Better than the Movie!!!,"A lot of scenes explained more in detail, more great scenes that were left on the cutting room floor that would had made the movie much better. It's a fast read and easy to follow. Worth a look!"
5,Plain and Simple FUN,"Remember reading the ""Star Wars"" novelizations back when you were a kid? Remember how fun that was? Well, this book will take you back to those fun days!This book is very well-written for a tie-in. There are some awkward writing tics that could have been edited out (people seem to spend a lot of time ""patting"" their hands ""in the air"" in this book, Padme's ""baby rabies"" is a bit much, and there are some confusing sentences), but all-in-all this book is a Saturday-afternoon delight!I especially enjoyed the parts of the book where we get to learn more about Shmi.Hey, you need a dose of fun! See the movie, then buy this book! You won't be disappointed!"
5,More Depth,"Ok, I thought this book was excellant. In the movie (which I Loved also) you see Anakins love for Padma but you don't realy see how she feels untill the end of the movie b/c in movies you can't see what there thinking, in the book you see Padma feeling alot sooner and it makes more sense when she declares her love for him..Also Obi-Won doesn't seem quite as harsh. You sort of see his reasons for being so tough on Anakin. The book gives depth to the characters. It's very very good. If you liked the movie pick up the book you'll like the movie even more."
5,Very Good Book,This book is very good. I really enjoyed it. It makes me look forward to watching the movie when it comes out. This helps to tie in about Anikin's life to how he becomes Darth Vader. It makes it more personal seeing how he became that way. We already know what he becomes. This helps to show us how he gets there. Can't wait for the next book.
5,An awsome and exciting story,"I belive STAR WARS: EPPISODE II- ATTACK OF THE CLONES, to be a worthy fallow up to eppisodes I, IV, V, & VI. It is a well written story. I think it comes very close to the movie."
4,Great addition to the movie,"I read this book straight through on a long plane flight. It was almost like watching the movie again, but better. The book fills in a lot of gaps that the movie has. Some of the scenes in the book appear in the deleted scenes of the DVD version. In the interviews, Lucas talks extensively about how he wanted the movie to be a certain length, so certain scenes had to be cut. My recomendation is to leave the scenes and make the movie longer. If it takes 3 hours to tell the story, it takes 3 hours.The book adds some history to Anakin's mother, and does a much better job of telling the love story between Anakin and Padme. Their relationship is much more believable than it was in the movie. In the book Anakin doesn't come across quite so whiny, because a lot of his frustrations are explained better. Definitely worth the read, no matter how many times you've seen the movie."
4,cant wait for may 16th,This book made me want to see the movie even more. It is a great story that makes you really want to see the movie. The book/movie is much darker than TPM. You will see the begins of the dark lord of the sith and in a strange way you feel sorry for him once you discover the reason why. Once I saw it I can honestly say that I dont blame him. If some one .....I think you'd better read the book or see the movie to find out the rest:-)
4,"On topic, Most of the time...","This story has all of the movie; and more. Yet, after a awile it is hard to remember what really happened in the movie. If you don't want to forget it, then be careful as you read the book. However, the story additions were great, and they gave you more insight to the characters. Over all, a good read."
1,Batting less than 1.000.....,"I think I've read just about everything Mr Salvatore has written. Demon Wars, Drizzt and Wulfgar, Vector Prime... Salvatore is simply amazing. His detail with weapons, fighting techiniques, strategies, character development, story telling. This guy CAN do it all. Terry Brooks did an excellent job with Episode I, he really made the movie/story enjoyable for me. I was so excited when I read that Salvatore would be writing what was to be potentially the darkest chapter of Star Wars....... then I read the book. I'm sorry, Bob, but this novel was terrible. You had a few good parts, but you rushed the entire 2nd half of the book. All of the fighting scenes, Force battles, military strategy... what happened? This was not Salvatore's normal writing style. I was very dissapointed with the Episode II novel."
4,Excitement to the last word!,"Salvatore had me rivetted to the book from the start. I loved the background look he gave us at the characters, particularly Shmi Skywalker. This story has a lot of heart. It really makes you wish that Anankin could avoid becoming Darth Vader, but I guess that's inevitable. Poor Padme!"
2,OMG,"I read this cuz i thought the guy on the cover was hot , but, since i havent seen any star wars movies at all i didnt really get alot of it, like how the girl is older than him by like a gajillion years , BUT even though i didnt get it , i thought it was really well written and i wanna see the movie(ANAKINS HOTT)"
4,"Great book, but...","I personally loved the book and I'm looking forward to the movie, but my problem with the story (not the writing or even the plot) is that it feels a lot like The Empire Strikes Back; and if fact there are several similarities that I will not mention."
3,uneventful,"blah boring novelization. on the star wars movie prequel tie-in novels scale, this one ranks way below ep1...and a billion miles above the stinkfest that is the ep3 novelization (by that martial arts poseur woodring)."
1,Who is R. A. Salvatore...,"... and why did he get paid for this [junk]? I've seen fan fiction written by high school kids better than this.Again and again, Salvatore fails to deliver the goods, turning a fun, exciting movie into an exercise in drudgery and mangled prose. We are never given descriptions of any of the characters, location, ships and weapons, etc. other than the brief ""long silky brown hair"" on occasion. Anyone not already intimately familiar with the Star Wars milieu, and ATOC in particular, will have a hard time trying to follow just what the hell is going on. The emotional passages are flat, the characters completely undeveloped, and the battle scenes bland and uninteresting.I don't buy the idea that this book had to be dumbed down for the kids. I read ""Dune"" at age eleven, and didn't miss a thing. Kids ain't that stupid, Sal. But maybe your fans are."
3,Doesn't tell you much beyond the movie,"Other than a few extra scenes featuring Shmi Skywalker and Padme with her family, this book doesn't go much beyond the movie. Maybe I wouldn't think this if I had read the book first. Then again, I have found that other Star Wars novelizations have given some added perspective to what you see on the big screen. The action sequences didn't translate that well onto text so without more in-depth characterization, I think the novel is lacking."
4,Great book for a great movie,"The book had some extras that make it well worth the read. R.A. Salvatore is a staple in Sci-fi/Fantacy and also wrote the first book of the ""The New Jedi Order"" series. His imagry is vivid. He really knows how to put in to words what he wants us to imagine. Even harder, he can verbalize what we have already seen or will see on film. An author, not so good at this, will create a seperate image between film and book. Salvatore is a great author who I look forward to reading more."
5,A must read!!!!!!!,R.A Salvatore you really did it this time!!! Star Wars Episode II is the best book!!! I fineshed it too fast for my liking. This book keeps you on the edge of your chair and has special seens not shown in theaters!!!!Defintly a MUST READ. Has many twists and turns and the plot is supirior!!!! if you liked the movie you will love the book!!!! If you didnt understand the movie i suggest reading the book. NO seens are boring and both boys and girls will love it!!!!!You cant put this one down!!!!Defintly worth the money andif you read ANY reviews that are bad they are NOT true because this is the best book ever!!!!!! And even though one of the characters has my name I still read it!!!
5,A Great Read!,"What a smash! A great read and thorough insight into the characters. Very personal and exciting all the way to the high-octane conclusion!As a Christian fiction author myself, I paid close attention to the universal POV that transitioned so smoothly between characters. Vivid writing. Thank you, Salvatore!"
4,Much better than the movie,"This book was pretty good. Definitely better than the movie, for those that are fans of the Star Wars franchise but didn't like the I-III movies. It gave me a better understanding of the start of Anakin's slide toward the dark side, and I understand the motivations and innerworkings of all the characters much better than I did prior to reading the Trilogy. Not as good as Revenge of the Sith, but better than Phantom Menace. Worth the read."
4,Salvatore does it again,R.A. Salvatore is a perfect match for the Star Wars Universe in my opinoin. And in writting the novelization of Episode 2 he proves that he can get into any characters head even a nightmare filled one such as Anakin Skywalker. It was a great novel and I recommend it to any fans of both Salvatore and Star Wars.
1,I tried to like this book...,"I really did. I read it all the way through twice, hoping that the second read would show me that it wasn't all that bad... and i suppose the parts that were taken directly from the movie weren't bad at all.. its just when Salvatore decides to fill in the blanks that this book becomes corny and shallow. Those who disagree should re-read the parts where Anakin meets Padme's family. It feels unecessary and silly. The book would be alot better if you bought a black magic marker and crossed those parts out. My other feelings about the book have already been said. After Terry Brooks' adaptation of Episode 1 proved (to me) to be better than the movie, i was very disappointed with this one."
5,this is an awesome book,my brother and i both read and loved this book! we would recommend it to any star wars fan!
1,"Choppy, incoherent",The author try to stitch together numerous events from numerous sources. It is not laid out in a coherent manner. Having lived in the society for a lifetime I recommend that to be informed this is not the book to read. Try reading Edward Seaga's My Life and Leadership volumes 1 & 2.
5,'Escape' movie from Amazon,"This is the movie made of the book 'Escape' written in the 1930's. As per the times then, it's a super movie and arrived here in great shape; I love ordering from Amazon."
5,How come I never saw this movie before?,"I really liked this movie. Of course, I love Norma Shearer, WWII movies and true love stories. I can not believe I have not seen it before. I'm ashamed to call myself a film buff."
5,great,"they look great, i love Yosemite Sam, that is why i ordered them. would reccommend them to everyone. i love them."
5,Smiling and beguiling....a classic of 80's art pop.,"I'm so happy this album finally got reissued. The Banshees never lost their edge, but Dreamhouse was the first album that introduced sexuality to their music that was only briefly suggested before, such as on Kaleidoscope. This is a gorgeously playful and darkly sexy record that shows the Banshees, previously called ""humorless,"" having fun in the studio, exhibiting their new found strength as a group from endlessly touring their previous record Juju. It's ironic that their guitarist would be ousted right after it's release.The recording itself has a very lush, open sound with plenty of reverb and atmospheric sounds added to the mix, such as bells and foot stomping, recorder and strings. I still consider ""Slowdive"" to be the sexiest song I've ever heard. Finally, we get the 12-inch mix of it! In my opinion, The Banshees would not exhibit such strength as a band again on record until 1988's sublime Peepshow."
1,Don't buy this,"The price seemed too good to be true- but it burned the rice one of the first times, then it just wouldn't cook the rice. We returned it, and won't buy a refurbished item again."
1,"looks aren't everything, so keep looking","looks good! but....lid does not fit well. emailed Cuisinart, but no reply. plus rice cooks too fast. bought for looks and name. real diappointment."
2,James Hall losing his touch,"I used to love James Hall's novels particularly his Thorn novels. With this book and his last few, I think he is losing it. I give this book 2 stars only because I love Thorn and I still have hope for the author.What's bad. I used to read Hall because of his original and quarky bad guys. I also read him for his use of language (he's also a poet) and imagination. In this book the bad guys don't seem very unusual, the language is that of a dime novel, the coincidences are to many, and certain important events are left unexplained... such as an explosion that plays a key role towards the end of the book.This novel seem like a novel that was rushed and nobody double checked. It also has lost most of the grit (as have his last two or three books) that made him such a fun read.I hope Mr. Hall recovers from his roller coaster ride into mediocrity."
5,Thorn's back!!!!,"Thorn is my favorite series character. Beginning with ""Under Cover of Daylight"", I've read all the books and ""Blackwater Sound"" is one of the best. It's got everything you'd expect from this author: moments that thrill you, others that touch you and some that make you laugh. And, the characters are memorable -- especially the still-in-love-with-her-dead-brother main villian.Definitely a five-star thriller."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.James W. Hall writes a great thriller and I also think this is one of his best.From it's dramatic opening to its satisfying conclusion, `Blackwater Sound' paints a riveting picture of southern Florida. Thorn, a laid back individual that seems to attract trouble like a magnet attracts steel, returns in another very satisfying novel of adventure.Halls dialogue and narrative paint a vivid picture. The locales of Southern Florida along with the characters, makes this a very `hard to put down' book.Highly recommended"
2,"Good story, Kindle edition fine.","Since I was going to the Florida Keys, I asked on the Amazon Kindle forum for some suggested reading, and this series was recommended to me. This is my first one.I enjoyed the story, though it fell somewhere between a mystery (no mystery) and action novel (not much action). Being unfamiliar with the characters, I had no pre-set notions or expectations. I found the characters to be less than fully fleshed out, though the other books may help in that regard.For me, the story moved along, but at no great pace or with breathless action. I guess I like my action heroes to be a little larger than life, and none were here.I have already purchased another in this series, and I will certainly read that while in Florida and give it another try. But this one didn't really thrill me."
1,Shame on You James W. Hall,"James did a disservice to his readers, to Thorn and to himself. I wish he had killed Thorn off instead of putting in such a pathetic effort. Not at all up to James W. Hall standards. Could the billfish segments have been more poorly researched?"
3,Thorn returns,"A revisit by an engaging hero and a meeting with characters from other books, mixed with straight ahead action, make this one enjoyable. Some notable holes in the plot will leave you wondering. What exploded and why in a crucial scene is never explained. But this was fun."
2,not for me,"If you like books that are very violent, this may be for you.If you like books to which the explanation of everything in the plot is, ""psychopath"" this book may be for you. I hated it. To be fair, in general i hate books where the device to explain an otherwise unbelievable set of characters is: one or more of them is a psychopath, so nothing needs to be explained, he or she is ""evil"" and could do anything. In addition, the characters are cardboard, the plot, such as it is , is dumb, and the most sympathetic character is a fish."
2,Modest juice for a modest squeeze,"This book was one of NPR&#65533;s Alan Cheuse&#65533;s picks of the season. While I admired it for its intense brevity, there were simply too many unfulfilled metaphors (a certain pink buffalo comes to mind) and lamentably lame high-techery to truly engage the reader (a hand-held neutron bomb, in essence, devoid of any calamitous health effects!). Although the well-sketched characters are praiseworthy, the mind boggles at the slipshod editing: the cause of, motivation for, and perpetrators of one entire scene (the conflagration in the marina) are never revealed, nor even implied. Just another, uh, fluke in a sea of editorial red herrings, intentional or otherwise. That said, there is a hint of Hemingway-esque majesty in the prologue and scattered throughout its 300+ pages that somewhat ameliorates these shortcomings. In sum, modest juice for a modest squeeze."
3,SOME UNANSWERED QUESTIONS,I AGREE WITH AT LEAT ONE OTHER REVIEWER THAT YOU ARE LEFT WITH SOME QUESTIONS. I DID LIKE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE FISHING ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST CHAPTER. BUT I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT WITHIN THE FIRST 100 PAGES I HAD A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHAT THE WHOLE STORY WAS ABOUT AND FINISHED THW BOOK TO SEE HOW IT CAME TOGETHER.thE BOOK DID HOLD MY ATTENTION AND WAS A PRETTY FAST READ. THERE ARE A FEW QUESTION I WOULD LIKED CLEARED UP BUT OH WELL. THIS BOOK HAS JUST ABOUT THE DEFINITION FOR DYSFUCTIONAL FAMILY
4,Surprisingly Good,"Let me admit first, and foremost, when I started listening to this CD I didn't think I would like it. It didn't seem catchy, or engaging enough to make me like it, but about halfway through, though I started to really enjoy it. The songs were actually interesting, the tunes were pretty. This CD is a great one to have not only because you will enjoy listening to it, but because you get the whole story line of the musical from the score. Sometimes you buy a CD and haven't a clue what the show is about, but with this one you feel as if you are in the theater with your eyes closed. The music is not new, it isn't poppy or rockish; isn't Tim Rice or Phil Collins, but it is enjoyable for all audiences. I would suggest this one to just about everyone. If you're only into the new stuff (Wicked and the likes) maybe you can skip this one, but everyone else needs it. Favorite song: ""Rivers Cannot Flow Upwards."""
2,Not the best example of Sarah's music.,"Much as I love Sarah's music, Nightingale isn't her best music. She's doing so much better selecting and writing her own work. Something from La Traviata next? Pleeeease."
2,As a lyricist . . .,". . . Charles Strouse is a pretty good composer. And as a composer of pseudo panto opera, he reminds one that natural melodists often turn dull when they aim to be highfalutin, if that's indeed what he's trying to do here. Jokey in an excessively juvenile fashion, reasonably well performed (Sarah Brightman's charm continues to escape me), and, well, dull, Nightingale might be picked up by inveterate Strouse fans, but I can't imagine where the interest lies otherwise.For excellent obscure Strouse, seek out I and Albert."
3,Good but....,They look nice and wear well but the back end ripped out of one pair the other day. I don't know if it was by my doing or defective pants (wardobe malfunction) but they could be a bit better.
1,Piece of junk.,"It`s annoying to put up and loosens after about an hour because the bar in the back that tightens and loosens it is bent, so it`s not very stable. Piece of junk."
2,You get what you pay for,"It's not bad - it does what it does but if the pressure mount isn't strong enough, my 22lb son can climb onto it and pull backwards causing the gate to fall on top of him."
1,good game for a bad dog,"I made the mistake of sending my fiance to the store to buy a gate to keep the dogs out of the kichen and this is what he came home with. It is a game for our 8 year old 60 pound basset mix to get it open and get in. We have come home to a lot of messes since owning this gate. I think more now, than before we owned it. I am looking right now on Amazon for a gate that will hold him better, as I can't really put him in a staight jacket everyday."
2,you get what you pay for..,"the gate is ok,it's good if need a gate that will stay in place and NOT need to be moved alot..easy to step over.I resold them on craigslist for 10eathey are just to cheap..."
2,not for us,"We bought the gate to keep the cat out of the bedroom at night. She easily jumped over it, so we gave it away."
3,Meow,"I got this gate so I could leave my door open to get some cool night air while cooking dinner and not have to worry about my cat escaping, but he can jump right over this!"
5,"Gate only expands to 40""-41"".","We got the gate to block the foot of our stairs for times when our 2-year-old grandson was visiting. We wanted a removable gate that did not need to be bolted into the wall. However, this gate only expands to a maximum width of 40""-41"" and our staircase is wider than that so I had to return it. It would be nice for a standard-size doorway, though."
1,Don't buy this gate,I have grandkids and dogs and this gate didn't last 6 months with them. The plastic stretched out and it wouldn't secure itself any more. I know you want to because it's inexpensive...but don't do it!
3,Paid 1/2 the Price in Dec. 2011!,"We really like this gate. It is simple and fits perfectly in our doorway between the kitchen and laundry room. Our toddler puts his entire weight on it trying to move it, but it hasn't budged yet. I'm not sure why some reviewers are stating that it isn't secure. However, things might have changed in the few months that we bought it. That is why I am giving it 3 stars instead of 5 - We bought this gate in December 2011 for $13. I'm not sure if I would pay twice the price now... What the heck Amazon! I think they are price gouging since it became more popular."
4,strong gate,need this gate for dogs when we were painting rooms and it is a vary strong gate just love it .......
1,Waste of Money,This gate is a total waste of money. It doesn't lock securely in place so it's impossible to get it to fit snugly in door frames.
1,Terrible! Clunky and hard to use,"I ordered this gate based on other Amazon customer reviews. It seemed most people liked it and only commented on the ugly appearance but were happy with the functionality. Yes, it's ugly. Aren't most gates? But this gate in particular is also clunky and hard to use. We already had a great gate, although it was priced a bit higher and we got it at Target. Our other gate looks very similar (gray, plastic...) but works like a charm, while this one and its weird ""memory"" clip make it difficult to set up and take down.I hated this gate so much that we just donated it to charity. I didn't even want to bother returning it through Amazon because come on - what a pain! I would have to re-package it and lug it to the post office. I would not recommend buying this gate - get a tension gate that locks into place, as it's much easier to use."
2,not satisfied,these are very difficult to fit into a doorway. Very hard to change the size. Works fine once you manage to fit it into the door frame but the effort required is too much. I guess you get what you pay for in this case. Note: I do not use this for a child. I use mine to confine my rabbit to a certain room. I cannot comment on the level of safety.
3,Good Product for Price; may be better for pets not babies,This gate is sturdy when in place.Set up was easy and delivery was fast!The plastic did crack on part of the gate. I am not sure if this happened because it was too tight or my 9 mo old did it by pulling up on it. I was able to easily fix it with duct tape. I did not mind this because I did not expect it to be superior quality for this price.
3,No good if your walls have molding,"This gate doesn't work on a wall with molding at the bottom, as you will find in many NYC apartments. The rubber pads on either side of the gate must be in contact with the wall; with molding, only the bottom ones touch. No way to adjust the pads, so the top of the gate is not anchored. No good. Glad to have Amazon's free return policy...Also, I'm not sure how one of the reviewers was able to operate this easily with one hand. The gate doesn't extend smoothly (i.e. requires that you pull on each end) and the locking mechanism would be difficult to operate with one hand, I think. Though, to be fair, I gave up on it as soon as I saw that it wouldn't work in my apartment... so maybe it eases up with time?This would work fine between two smooth walls. It seems like it would be pretty solid."
4,It does the job,"I have twins that love to be in the kitchen when I'm cooking and it was getting annoying because I was always tripping over babies and was always worried that they would get hurt. So we got these gates and it worked for a little while, until they stood up on them. After about two or three times of the gates falling down we just decided to not use them. Then a friend of mine came over and asked me why I wasn't using the gate and I told her that they wouldn't stay up. Some how she fixed it and now her daughter and my two daughters all stand up on them and it hasn't fell down since. Even though I read the directions two or three times I could do what she did."
3,Not Impressed,"Pros:- Better than using a piece of cardboard to block areas- expandableCons:- does not stay in place- locking mechanism slides very easily, hardly locks- need to use a chair to keep it from falling overBasically we bought these to keep our puppy in the kitchen, but we've learned not to put these wall to wall, but rather just prop them up against a chair since the locks on the gate are junk and do not stay locked anyway. The gates are a little short as well. Get what you pay for I guess."
4,Does the job for the most part,"My wife and I bought two of these to keep our 15-month old son from going through either of the entrances to the back of our apartment. They took a bit of effort to get into our doorways, but now that we understand how to do it, it's pretty simple. They don't stay in place very well, especially if you accidentally kick it or if your kid is determined to get through.For those of you who plan on stepping over this gate regularly, be sure to do so with care or wear socks/shoes/something to protect your feet. Both of my feet already have scars from having chunks of skin cut off while hopping over them. You never realize just how useful your toes are until they're injured!!All in all, it does the job well enough for our needs, but if you need something that's sturdy, this might not be the best option."
3,North States Pressure Gate,"The mechanism that locks and unlocks the gate is hard to set, making this frustrating to install and hard to move. It seems sturdy though, although my daughter can unlock it by reaching over (but thats with any of these gates). It is more durable than the wooden gates, which snap after a while. Recommend, with adequate supervision. Also, keep the lock on the other side from curious babies and toddlers."
3,Just Okay,"I was tired of searching every store (Walmart, Target, Babies R Us, Toys R Us) for plastic baby gates; they were way too expensive or there were no plastic options. I checked out Amazon and found these. I ordered two of them and received them on time. The gates are made of sturdy plastic, but they don't fit my doors well. It fits too loosely or too tight, and my 1 year old has figured out if he shakes the gate enough, he can make it come out of the door frame. That defeats the purpose of having a baby gate! I also knew that these were a little short, but my kids have figured out how to climb the gates, as well. I more than likely would not purchase these again."
3,easy to use,"This is a very good product, very sturdy and so easy to use. I bought it for my Buchan and unfortunately it was a little smaller in height than I would like(she jumps over it when no one is home)."
2,So stiff and outsmarted by my dog,"Packaging has no instructions on how to install - it's a gate so it should be easy to figure out but the design is not intuitive.Once I figured out how to install, I then had trouble opening and closing the gate because it doesn't slide very easily without two people pulling on either ends of the gate. Anyhow, it proved to be a solid gate once installed. I kicked it and it didn't budge. Satisfied, I locked up my 6lbs puppy in the kitchen behind this gate and left home.But alas, my tiny puppy used her little paws like a rock climber / spiderman to climb over the gate that very first day.I'm impressed by my dog, but not impressed with this product. If you have a crafty dog, get a gate with bars, not a gate with criss-cross barrier like this one that dogs can use to climb."
3,Okay gates,We bought two of these gates and I would say overall they are okay. They do their job. The only thing I have to complain about it that they are hard to close up. Other then that they are sturdy.
5,North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate Works Great,It does the job perfectly at a price that is too good to pass up. Very easy to set up and use. Highly recommend.
3,Doesn't work with molding/trim at the bottom of the doorway/opening.,"The gate seems a little bit weak and it was a little difficult to put up the first time. The locking pin did remember where it needed to stay though. However, I will be returning this gate first thing because the bottom bumpers hit my molding at the bottom of my stairwell and prevent the top bumpers from being pressed into the wall. Just won't work for us, but not that bad of a gate for the money."
1,Don't waste your money on this!!!!,"I needed a baby gate for my baby to ensure she didn't go near stairs, so, with funds tight, I bought this economic model. What a mistake! The latch sticks, the plastic bends, it is not easily moveable or adjustable! I wish I had never bought this item. Don't make the same mistake I did. If you can, just get an older model wooden one."
5,Great for what I needed,"Our new house has an odd feature where the back is fenced in, but the dogs can run up the steps and out to freedom due to the lack of a gate. This gate basically seals in our steps so that the dogs can run around without us worrying about where they might be in ten minutes.For me, that means 5 stars as it was cheap, quick to install, and completely what I needed. However, less than 2ft high might be problematic for containing some kids/animals. Also, as noted by others, I wouldn't want to have to adjust this gate often, though maybe only being 23inches tall could solve the need to take it down!"
2,Flimsy and Stiff,"This product Sounds like a great idea, but it's flimsy construction makes it a loser. The locking bar bows out when you have it in place, looking like it's going to snap. When trying to open it and select a locking position, it feels a bit like an off brand 80s transformer action figure- like if you move it the wrong way and arm is going to snap off. The plastic breaks easily, as evidenced by it arriving with the bottom corner broken, leaving a jagged piece in a dangerous spot. UPS is picking it up monday and taking it back- and I'm buying something else!"
5,North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate,"North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate is fantastic. Received the product in two days with Amazon Prime account, free shipping, and there was no damage at all. I bought it to keep my two little dogs in the kitchen while out shopping and running errands so they would not have any accidents on the carpet in the house. It is very easy to use and fits the door opening perfectly, but is adjustable to much larger openings."
3,Good for the price but not what I expected,good for the price but I found it tedious to set up and install. I wanted something that was quick and easy.
2,CHEAP! Thats what it was....,I got this very fast from Amazon. Upon opening the box found out the unit was a bit bent and not straight. It's cheap plastic. Now it's in my garage doing nothing.
1,Would Work Better As A Plate Than A Gate,"I just received this gate in the mail maybe 15 minutes ago and I already dislike it. I would have given it 0 stars if I could. The thing does not fit our standard size doorway. It's either too big or too small in the settings. I tried putting towels on both sides to hold it up, but it is still loose. Also, the gate is practically impossible to adjust I pinched/bruised my finger trying to adjust it. Waste of money!"
3,Not bad...,Its not a bad item. its just that it takes a while to set it up and the design of it is a bit sloppy in my opinion. bright side is its pretty affordable aside from that i wasn't fully pleased with the item
1,Worst Designed Gate on the planet.,This gate doesn't even make sense first of all. And more importantly it's lose when it's connected. This gate has caused us nothing but frustration. Returning immediately.
1,Falls off too easily,"I bought this gate and tried to install it at the entrance to kitchen, as my toddler daughter tries to crawl to kitchen to often. However this gate when installed is not sturday. It falls down when a bit of pressure is applied. Needless to say I did not install it as it was potentially dangerous for my daughter (she likes to crawl, and then try to stand with whatever she can hold onto).I would not recommend this gate to anyone."
1,TERRIBLE!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Don't make the mistake of going with the cheap thing. Once you get it small enough to get it in the spot you need to fit, it is impossible to expand it just by 0.5 inch to sit firm in the spot where you want it to be. Just terrible. I am a young male, who does not have a problem putting furniture together, yet this product was just a worse nightmare than any Ikea nightmare you might have ever had. This is being returned tomorrow."
1,Had to return it,"When I first saw this, I was so thrilled because it was very affordable and I needed to buy three gates. As soon as I opened the packages to try them out, I was very disappointed... Being a small woman, it was hard for me to adjust the length in order for the gate to fit my doorway. When I finally adjusted it to what I thought was the right width, the gate would not stay up and would topple over. I am now in the process of returning all three gates."
4,"cheap, solid, good!!","For the cheap price, i expected a POS to arrive, but this gate is very solid. The latch, however, is almost too sturdy and can be tricky to unlock. If you frequently remove the gate during the day, or have weak hand strength then this one might not be your best choice. If you set it and forget it once or twice a day... this is the least expensive way to go, while still having a sturdy gate that won't be problematic."
1,Not sturdy,"Bought these gates and they will not stay up at all. Any pressure from the kids and they fall right down, even if the kids just touch them. I thought it was just me but had my husband try to get them to stay and they just won't Waste of money would rather pay more to know my kids are secure and safe."
4,great gate!,This gate is very sturdy and handy! If you are using it for big dogs it is a shorter gate so you would need to set it up a little off the ground but it has worked great for me!
3,OK for the price and my purpose,"This gate is used to keep our dogs in the kitchen. In the process, we humans have to step over it each and every time we travel back and forth to the kitchen. It works for this purpose and is low enough to not need a pole vault and high enough that the dogs do not want to jump over. I do notice that every few days I have to set the gate back up because it has fallen, but I have not pinpointed whether this is the gate's fault or somebody in the household (4 teenagers, 2 adults). Either way, the gate is positioned between two walls with no trim, and when I set it up, it feels like it has a solid hold and when I pick it up from the floor, the lock is still set. Because I can't figure out why it keeps falling, I would not recommend it for a toddler or stairway."
2,Cheap gate,"The best thing about this gate is that it's inexpensive, but it's cheaply made. Mine had some broken pieces of plastic in the box when it arrived just like other posters. It still works though, and I use it on the guest room door to keep baby out. It's low and easy to step over, but we don't use that room much anyway. Baby hasn't messed with it so I don't know for sure how well it would hold up to that.If you just need a little barrier like I do then this is a cheap solution. If you need a good gate to use on a busy door or where a child will be pushing on it and trying to climb then I'd go with something better.Update: Once my child began pushing on the gate, he did push it right over. It was also difficult to adjust and put back into the door whenever we needed to take it out and put it back."
3,Ugly but does the trick,"We bought this in a pinch because we left our wooden gate at someone's house 4 hours away. It always looks like it's backwards because all of the structural plastic components are exposed. However, it does the trick. I like that it's not too tall so it's fairly easy to step over, even for someone very clumsy (I should note that I'm 5'8"", for someone 5', it might not be so easy to step over). It doesn't slide very well and it's not as easy to adjust as our wooden one, the ""Supergate Extra Wide Wire Mesh Gate"", but like I said, it'll due for now."
4,Great gate for a great price,I purchased this gate to use on my deck to contain my dog. The gate is fairly easy to use and seems durable. It is also held up very well all summer outside and being exposed to the elements. The negative aspect of this product would be the height of the product. It works fantastic for my 15 pound dog but if you are looking for a gate for a child 2 1/2 years or older or a larger size pet this gate may be too short for you. For the purpose I purchased it for and the quality and cost of the product I would highly recommend it!
2,Meh!,"The pluses? It's cheap, and it does keep the baby and the dogs separate from each other.The minuses? It is a pain in the behind (or more exactly, the palm, the fingers, and that soft webbing between the thumb and forefinger). I have caught one or more of these in the ""adjustable"" arm while battling with it to adjust, and then to lock down securely. I have a number of blood-red bruises the size of pinheads on the palm of my hand below my thumb from the last couple of times I tried to adjust it to fit a door size.My suggestion is to go to a store and try out a few gates before you sacrifice your flesh and blood to one of these things."
3,It does what it needs to.,"It does what it needs to, and keeps our dog out of areas most of the time. It's a little clumsy to use, and difficult to secure against walls with a baseboard. If it has a baseboard, then the gate will be tight at the bottom, but looser on the top - making it easier for our large dog to push it over."
4,Dreaded this gate... but pleasantly surprised!,"So we have a wonky bottom-of-the-stairs area that needed a gate under 25"" high, and this gate was pretty much it. It looks so junky, and it would be in a high-traffic area, where we'd have to remove it and re-install it several times a day... ugh. But we've been pleasantly surprised at how well it works! I can remove it one-handed with my 25-lb toddler in the other arm, and re-install it just as easily. She pulls on it with all her might and can't dislodge it. The price is right, too. It's ugly, to be sure, but does the job much better than I'd hoped for."
4,Efficient but not pretty......,"This gate is easy to use, and has worked well, it is just not that pretty to look at. If you don't care how it looks, then you can't beat the price and your child will still be safe, which is what is most important."
3,Not for areas where you have baseboards,"If you have baseboards where you want to mount this gate, don't get it. For that matter don't get any gate where you cant adjust the pressure mounts if putting it somewhere where you have a baseboard which sticks out thicker than the wall, you need adjustable pressure mounts or it won't work. If you are mounting in a door frame or somewhere where the walls are flush it should work just fine for the price."
2,You get what you pay for,"This gate is inexpensive, which is great, but it is difficult to use unless you enjoy jumping over it a lot. The ""memory"" feature that is supposed to make it easy to release and replace once you've got it set up doesn't work at all. The process of tightening the gate back down removes the bar that is supposed to keep its ""memory.""In addition, it is very difficult to get a snug fit in any doorway, since you can't use the level to spread it out, you've got to push with your hands and risk mashing your knuckles, which I did a number of times. Eventually, I just gave up and now I essentially lean it against the door frame. This works well enough, but I wouldn't recommend this gate to anyone."
4,A pretty good gate,I bought two of these gates to keep my house rabbits out of the computer room and away from my books. They are holding up well and fit tightly in the doorways. The only problem I can see is that they don't accommodate uneven walls as well. The height is just right to keep the bunnies out but not so high as to make them difficult to step over. They don't look too bad either.
2,Ummmm...,"Not only is this gate UGLY, it is complicated to install! I just could not get a tight fit with this! It sucks and I absolutely hate jumping over this bulky gate. I pushed it out of the way after the second day and ordered another one that I absolutely love. I was on a budget yeah, but man, the old saying is so true--you pay for what you get. Thumbs down for this one."
1,Stopped working after less than a year,"I set it up the first time to secure fit into one entryway. After about 9 months I decided to try and re-adjust it to another entryway, but it didn't fit well on that one for some reason. When I went to put it back on the original entryway IT WOULD NOT LOCK INTO PLACE AS BEFORE; The wedge that the metal latch goes into was suddenly too weak to hold the metal latch into place as needed. I'm having to buy another gate after only a year of using this one..."
1,Nope,Recieved and immediately processed a return. Very hard to adjust to right legnth. Makes for a PIA to open and close. Flimsy plastic so once you adjust it to fit the doorway and put pressure on it to lock it will bow and not make contact with all 4 pads causing it to be loose on one corner. Amazon was very quick about the return which says nothing for the gate really.
1,Absolutely didn't work at all.,"I followed all the instructions as close as I could, but I simply could not get this gate to work. It simply would not stay in place. I think we eventually threw it out."
4,"If you want to spend less than $20, this is your gate.","I am pleasantly surprised by this gate for the price I paid. It's not fancy, a little difficult to adjust if you want to move it to a different width doorway, and definitely requires 2 hands to put up. However, it holds really well, and even manages to fit in the uneven doorways of our old and crooked farm house where no doorway/trim is perfectly level or even. We have two of them, and if it weren't for our desire to have walk-thru gates in other doorways, I'd be thrilled to just save money and buy a bunch of these.Bottom line, this gate is not fancy or particularly attractive, but it's sturdy and more than sufficient for the great price!"
3,You get what you pay for,"I have an older version of this same gate, which has worked perfectly fine for us. I ordered two additional gates as puppy gates and am a bit disappointed. One was damaged during shipping, however not worth the cost to return it for a replacement (nor worth the carbon expense to do so).They are extremely difficult to operate and I cannot get one to lock into place.For $14, I guess this is what I should have expected. I really miss the days when companies took pride in their products and provided a quality item for consumers."
4,Good gate,"This gate does its job for the price. It is not the best quality gate out there, but it works. We have it in our doorwary leading to the garage. We like that it is low enough for us adults and older kids to step over."
4,Works just fine.,"We didn't buy this for style, we bought it for function, and it does its job well. We got it specifically to keep our puppy confined in the kitchen during the daytime so that she has space to play. It's plenty tall for a doxie baby and even with me leaning on it several times, it fits securely in the doorway. The gate itself feels very non-invasive, and it was a great buy for the price."
2,poor quality - bad packaging for shipping,the packaging was bad and the gate came damaged - no 'functional' pieces were broken so i didn't bother sending it back.
4,"a hilarious, futuristic novel!","This book shows us liberalism gone too far, in an outlandish, implausible future which may not be as far from our reality as we think...."
3,C'est trop (peu)--Too much & too little,"Moody and atmospheric, this directoral debut by Claire Devers tranplants a Tennessee Williams story to 1980s France. Something may have gotten lost in the translation. The story of a repressed accountant who finds pleasure in the pain provided him by a sullen African masseur is disturbing, but ultimately too sketchy. If you're going to plumb the darkest depths, there's at least a strong argument for going into some detail. No, not more torture scenes, but some hint of the actual relationship of the two protagonists might help."
3,Does not get knives very sharp but easy to use,"This was recommended to me as the right sharpener for my Global knives. This is the right way to dull your Global knives. It is OK for lower end knives but never gets them as sharp as my Chefs Choice. The minosharp is simple and quick but so is the Accusharp which is close to 1/5 the price.Ultimately, manual sharpening with a stone is slow but gets you razor sharpness.Not recommended. You have plenty of other options.Lower price, just as fast, sharper edge, easy to use = AccusharpHigher price, slightly faster sharpening, more versatile, very very sharp but not razor sharp, easy to use- Chef's choiceSimilar price (depends on brand), slower sharpening, requires skill, knowledge and practice but with all that you get the sharpest edge = good quality whetstones - use the water stones - less messy than the oil stones but both are effective"
1,Warranty nonexistent,"Good till it broke then told ""there isnt any warranty for this item...."" by the canadian distributor. Very disappointing and will not buy again. I assume same applies to Global knices. Back to Henkell"
4,it's alright i guess,"It makes dull knifes sharper, maybe not quite shaving-sharp, but reasonably sharp. Plastic construction feels fairly solid, though sometimes I wasn't quite sure if I had the angle right through the guides, especially on curved blades. There's about an inch toward the handle that the sharpener can't really get to with the cover on. Would be nice to have a 3rd fine wheel for honing (the two included ones are medium & coarse).This is my first sharpener of it's kind, so I wasn't really sure what to expect and don't really have a point of reference."
2,Not the sharpest sharpener on the block.,Was not that satisfied with this sharpener - not sure how good it is for my expensive knives? It well-made otherwise.
4,The Tall Book of Mother Goose,"This is a book I owned as a child and, contrary to the Horn Book review (above) the tall, thin shape did not make it difficult for me to handle and is one of the endearing features of the book. The pictures are colorful and charming and there is a good selection of nursery rhymes. There are enough rhymes and pictures to give a good variey, without having so many as to make it overwhelming as I have found is the case with some larger books. It is a great choice for a book of Mother Goose rhymes."
4,A good place for the Christian counselor to start!,Selwyn Hughes does a good job in dealing with the most common problems people face (Christian and Non-Christian sections inlcluded) and with the basic objections you will face in witnessing. Scripture references and a discussion of each issue are side by side on separate pages.A book I recommend to all Christians to review and keep on their bookshelves! This compact reference manual will come in handy in moments of need
4,Spacecraft - 'Earthtime Tapestry' (Lektronic Soundscapes),"Good third CD release from a new age/cosmic mostly instrumental four piece that's from Nashville(of all places).Tunes I found myself playing over repeatedly were the title cut ""Earthtime Tapestry"",the mind-lifting ""Living World"",the atmospheric ""Elder's Mourning"",""Beyond"" and the somewhat eerie ""Thread Of Continuity"".I don't usually favor much new age,ONLY those who have a space/cosmic overtone.Line-up:Tony Gerber-guitar&synth,Giles Reaves-synthesizers,John Rose-synthesizer and Dianne Timmons-synth&vocals.Wow,I've never seen a band with four(count 'em)synth players.Just might appeal to some fans of Kraftwerk,Tim Blake,Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze."
3,It's okay.,"I like this product. It works just the way it is advertised, and doesn't hurt at all. The only downside, is that It doesn't turn on all of the time. I have to switch it on and off about 3-5 times before I can get it to work. It's cheap, and you can tell. But it is designed well and when it works, its great."
5,Soul-wrenching performance straight from Sarah's heart...,There are some works of music that seem so inspired that its incredulous how the composer could have thought of such great tunes himself... The same applies to this very performance...Ive heard many cds...and Sarah is really in a class of her own.Obviously so;she never had to go through any of those violin competitions.Shes the most natural violinist. The same nine yr old girl who released her debut album MUST be gifted in a very very natural way.Hearing is Believing...her playing is inspired naturally.Even more so in this very recording of the Goldmark...I strongly recommend this album to any TRUE lover of music...music being defined as something truthful from the heart....its really amazing how Sarah will sound in another 10 yrs time.... i apologise for this informality...but words was never my preferred form of communication. :)
2,stale!!!,These were not all very fresh! I bought these nd split the whole thing with my parents. Mine were half stale and my parents' have been half stale. I wasn't too thrilled.
1,MS,The waffies were stale. They obviously are very old and they did not taste at all like they used to.
1,Self Teaching Geometry,I am very disapointed with this book. I expected more visual angles with rules and more practice exercises to accommodate the Rules. Instead this book requires a lot of reading which can be confusing if the person is new to gemometry. I do not recommend this book.
2,Nice Looking Camera,I like the camera but I found out that there is a short some where in the camera and drains the battery fast and batterys are not cheap I've taking about 10 pictures and went through 3 batteries
5,A must read for anyone in community development,"This book was a required reading for a class and I actually enjoyed it. The housing models presented in the book are very easy to understand and Shook does a great job of showing ""case studies"" of organizations/ministries that have carried out each one successfully. I was definitely taking notes as I read.Also, it is a faith-based book,but I highly recommend it to anyone concerned with [affordable] housing or redeveloping blighted communities."
1,Do Not Buy with MSI U120!!!,Do not buy with MSI U120!!! There is not slot in the U120 for memory expansion!!!!!!!Waste of money and shipping and time!!!!
2,not what it say it is,this item in not what is described to be and i had to return it after i purchased it.maybe for some other computer but definetly not for IMAC G4 1.0 GHz.
1,doa,"This product came doa (dead on arrival) and the sender requested that I return it before giving a refund. Given that the failure had already cost too much additional investment, I rejected that offer.I was pleased however that Amazon gave a no questions asked full refund."
4,Good Deal,"I got exactly what I wanted, it arrived exactly when they said it would, and was without defect. I know there is faster better out there but this is perfect for me"
3,ships from ID,"It Took forever to get to Miami!, crucial gives you free S&H; but amazon charged me for it.It's a good brand, great quality, but if you're far from ID get it in a store near you."
3,Mix-up,"Shipping was from two diffrent shippers igb from PC universe other 1gb was from xp passport, had to pay two shipping charges. They did not come at the same time so I put one in. Then waited for the other to arrive, it came two day later. I put the second 1gb in the computer I started to read the card the memory came in and check it with the other card they where two diffrent memorys one was 1gb ddr2 667MHz PC2-5300 the other was 1GB DDR2 533 MHz PC2-4200 They worked so I did not make and issue out of it Thats because cheap price $57.30 for two 2GB shipping from two venders $15.22 total cost of the memory $73.52."
2,eh..?,"Bought it in a bundle with my computer, doesn't even fit in computer. Make sure before you purchase."
1,Doesn't fit,"I returned this because it physically did not fit my laptop. Tolerances were off slightly, which made a difference."
5,This Sodimm is so bright!,"The Crucial 1 GB DDR2-667 Sodimm memory chip does just what it's supposed to do. It easily snapped right in to my Asus EEE PC and instantly boosted my RAM capacity. No hassles, no problems. I love when stuff ""just works."" This is a trustworthy product at a decent price. Bravo."
5,Helps an Asus eee 4g,Bought this product to double my memory in the small and handy asus eee laptop. My setup uses Ubuntu 8.10. The memory worked like a charm. It was a snap to install and I experience fewer memory related problems.
4,Seems to work fine,"Well priced. I bought this for my new MSI wind. Installed today, however it took me well over an hour because I had never installed RAM on my own before. Beware to MSI Wind owners - it will void your warranty on the netbook. This is likely because opening up the netbook is not as easy as you'd think. I was lucky I didn't ruin the thing. You'll have to judge for yourself how worth it is. The Wind system seems to operate about the same as it did previously, however if you use your netbook/laptop/desktop for major gaming, image editing, etc., you'll probably notice a difference."
5,It worked like a charm,I replace 2 X 512 GB memory in my Toshiba Satelite laptop with this 2 x 1 GB memory module. It was %100 compatible and had no issue recognizing the memory. I have never had problem wit Crucial memory modules.
1,Architecture magazine-esque writing,".This book does not meet the standard set by at least one otherbook in the series (""Trade Secrets of Great Design: RetailSpaces""). The ""Retail Design"" book provides intriguingstories behind the design of the spaces presented, includinginteractions with clients and problems that were encountered.In contrast, the stories in this book on offices spaces aremerely superficial and redundant descriptions of what you cansee for yourself in the photographs. There is little if anydiscussion of the design and construction processes. Thebook is no better than your typical architecture magazinearticle (and no wonder---the author is an architecture magazinecontributor).I would highly recommend the ""Retail Spaces"" book by StaffordCliff instead."
5,Love these,"Just love this set of pots and pans. I have Wolfgang puck and I truly like these better. I can actualy fry an egg with a teaspoon of margerine and flip it like nonstick. You just have to heat the pan first but use medium heat then heat your margerine until sizzeling and add your egg. To test the pans I even scrambled the egg when I flipped it and it will slide out just like nonstick. I love deep sides on the sauce pans, and the feel of the handels very good if your grip isn't so great. I have fibromylgia and sometimes I can't grip well or lift heavy items. These are just the ticket not flimsy but not to heavy. They clean beautifuly just use alittle bar keepers friend if you get a bad stick, or starch starts to build up. Just remember to turn down the heat when cooking and you will be fine. I also don't use metal utenciles I like the silicone ones."
4,Nice set...cleans easily!,I bought this set of cookware based on reviews here on Amazon.com by other customers. I am a real amateur when it comes to cooking but I like this set. I am learning that when cooking with these pots and pans you do not need to keep the flame on high! That will make it that much more difficult to clean them afterwards.
4,Didn't experience technical problems,"I own a Toshiba player, and when I played this DVD, I experienced no ""blotches"" nor ""blobs.""As far as the sound, I didn't notice any major phasing problems between visual/audio.The vocals, yes, are (i believe)perhaps overly-processed, but I find equal enjoyment in the theatrics and setup of this particular concert.I'm a relatively new Peter Gabriel fan, and I have never, until I purchased the DVD, been able to see this show. It was a convenient purchase, and I'll take what I can get."
1,macrovision problem?,"I think I have an answer to what some people are seeing. I think what happened is they over did the macrovision signal when mixing the main concert. I have an apex player. The menus and extras and preview play great. However, when I play the main concert it's a mess. Blotches and other problems come and go all through the show. Can the people that have problems try it in a different player and verify. Can the people that don't seem to have problems list the player."
2,Audio and video out of sync,"One of my favorite concerts on video; however, the audio and video are out of sync for the entire video!"
5,Best Live Show Ever!,"Secret World is the Best Live Show I can imagine! The mix of excellent impassioned songs, great sound, great stage presence of all the band- they were all having fun! plus the cool stage presentation make this the best concert!!When we play this dvd we all end up ""dancing in the aisles"". The girl singer- Paula- mixes so well w/gabriel and has one of the best voices ever. I've been to a decent amount of shows and this has to be the best- from the living room. It goes so well with a cranking sound system and big screen!It's interesting because I had the secret world live cd for years and it was amongst my favorites. I was thrilled to discover the dvd and the couple of ""dud"" songs on the cd that I used to skip over have some pretty cool stage theatrics in the dvd that make them riveting."
5,The best concert you will ever see,"Peter Gabiel is the consumate outstanding professional rock musician. I saw this show in Houston in '93. This may be the single best concert video ever recorded. It is a must for ANY music fan! Whatever you do, buy this video."
5,Very Vibrant and Outstanding DVD,"The sound and quality on this DVD was excellent! You could clearly hear Peter Gabriel, and he sounded great (which compared to the ""Growing Up"" concert DVD, he always sounded far away and faded out). All the band members, including Gabriel were very energitic and vibrant! This was a concert that I wished I would have seen with my own eyes. All the song selections that Gabriel made for this concert were either his better and livelier songs, such as Sledgehammer, Sulsbury Hill, and Shaking the Tree, or they were at least pleasant and melodic, and enjoyable to listen to. From beginning to end, this was a very entertaining DVD. I played this for several friends who were not into Gabriel, and one even said that he would love to purchase the dvd. It is a dvd that will make an impression on you! I am not a true Gabriel fan, yet I enjoyed the dvd and concert very much. I would recomend it to anyone in a heartbeat!"
2,I'm so disappointed !,"The poor quality of this DVD is unworthy of Peter Gabriel, his musicians, Robert Lepage and this amazing show. Nothing less ! I could do a better job with my own DVD recorder. The technical team responsable of that should be dismissed. It's awful to discover that such a great artists like that are so badly disserved. Deeply sorry for Peter, his fans around the world and for me."
2,"Great concert, poor DVD","I was really excited to get this DVD, only to face dissapointment. I actually bought this at a store, and I had to exchange it three times because each DVD skipped in between ""Digging in the Dirt"" and ""Sledgehammer."" I still haven't found a disk that doesn't do that, which makes me think that this DVD is destined to be re-called.The quality of the film looks cheap (but that's already been mentioned by other reviewers). I was dissapointed that there were limited extras--multiple camera angles would have been wonderful, considering that there is a lot of action going on the two stages and the camera offers a limited view. Also, this may sound a bit picky, but I wish the menu had larger print. It took me a while to realize what I was choosing... Overall, only Peter Gabriel fans will appreciate this DVD..."
1,Great Video - Horrible Quality,"I was surprised with the number of poor reviews for this video being that it is one of the best concert videos ever produced. Unfortunately, I have to agree with all the ""1's"" out there because the quality (compression or whatever) is absolutely horrible. C'mon Peter, get this remastered on Blu Ray baby!!!"
5,GENESIS IS GREAT BUT PETER GABRIEL IS GOD,"Anyone one who has been to a Gabriel show has had this religious experience. This one is no different. But why isn't God on DVD? And where is P.O.V. on DVD? Doesn't make much sense. Come on, Peter, you know what your fans think of you. You need to think of them. After all you only come around LIVE about every tens years. What are we to do in the interim? But who am I to question God?Buy this one. It's the next best thing to being there."
5,Allmost as good as being there',"Lets me ""relive"" THE BEST CONCERT I HAVE SEEN.Friends come over and ask if I mind playing that Peter gabriel concert again."
5,EXCELLENT,"I cannot understand everyone's complaint on the quality of the film. I first watched this on DISNEY, viewed the VHS version, and watched the DVD. All look and sound exactly the same.Don't be picky, and enjoy."
2,Worst video quality I've ever seen in a DVD,"I'm not sure whether the person who says ""disregard negative reviews"" is doing anyone a favour - because a lot of what's been said to date here about the poor video is negative but very accurate. I love Peter Gabriel - I have all his albums and had this DVD on VHS previously. I bought this DVD along with Growing Up in the weekend. Growing Up is superb video quality whereas Secret World Live is the worst and grainest music DVD I've ever seen. I have a very good quality TV set and hundreds of music DVDs so my comments are most certainly not to do with equipment or operator error. The sound quality is superb though and as a result you can tolerate the bad video for the amazing sound. It rocks in DTS! Its sad that such poor video quality (and one which boasts of being remastered!) is out there and I'm sure the artist himself did not know about this before it was released. Someone of PGs status deserves only the best."
4,"If you're a newbie, it'll be the best you've ever seen...","Absolutely stunning concert performance here. I bought the VHS when it came out, and literally wore the tape out. Visually, the DVD *is* better - crisper, cleaner, just better. But the audio mix on the VHS tape is far superior to any of the DVD mixes. Tony Levin carries this band, and for some reason the mixes on the DVD do not reflect this fact. It is vaguely reminiscent of the Eagles ""Hell Freezes Over"" DVD, where the songs are great, the video editing well done, and the audio is just wrong. If you're a casual listener, you will never know, and you will think that it sounds great. The more you know about audio, the more you are disappointed by how good this thing could have been, and wasn't."
3,great concert - too bad they ruined it on the DVD,"Have owned the VHS since '94 and was really looking forward to the DVD version. All the comments you have read about the grainy picture are true. Some of the reviewers dispute this and lay the blame on poor quality tv's. I played mine on a Sony XBR 53"" screen, and while the video quality is better than the VHS it is embarrassingly poor when comparing it to many other concert DVD, even some that were filmed well before this concert. The sound is allright, but even there they did not improve on the versions that precede it.To sum it up, if you have never seen the concert, buy it - you will enjoy it. For those of us that have seen previous versions, don't waste your money. I wish I would have taken previous reviewers seriously and skipped this one."
3,Where is the DVD?,"Three stars even though I know that this would be a great video from listening to the CD. My problem is that I will not buy a VHS any more. I want to buy this video. I want to buy it on DVD format. Royalties, liabilities, contracts, etc all likely conspire to prevent release on DVD. I find it hard to imagine that Peter Gabriel (or David Gilmore of Pink Floyd's Pulse and DST) really would want to handicap their income by not releasing their work in a modern format. Peter? David? Is there anybody out there? Release your work on DVD and have more income."
3,"Disappointing video quality, actually the worst I have seen","I don't understand how you can produce such a bad quality video on DVD. It doesn't even match VHS quality. The picture is extremely grainy and when a fast movement occurs, it disintegrates into large square pixels. Otherwise the concert and the audio are great... but you will have to listen with your eyes closed?"
2,Great Concert - Poor Picture Quality,"Make no mistake about it, this is a fantastic concert by Peter Gabriel.The only problem that I have with this DVD is the picture quality - it is not much of an improvement over the video. The sound is good however I was expecting a clean film transfer for this movie - they obviously did not go through this trouble.Pity though, I can't give this DVD 5 stars - the picture quality is poor."
1,Great show - bad transfer to DVD,"I have owned the VHS of this show for several years. It is one of the best shows that I have ever seen. The DVD on the other hand is pretty bad. The picture quality is no better than the VHS, is sometimes even compromised (watch MK's drum fills on ""Come Talk To Me"" - they cut off the bottom of the picture - you can't see his stick work on the snare drum anymore).My biggest gripe is the sound. What happened ? The sound is out of sync with the picture - it is terribly remixed. The vocals and drums have been mixed higher (and possibly added to ??) and the bass is GONE !! T.Levin's playing is great on the tape - but he is only there to watch on the DVD. Too bad.Maybe it will sound better on a 5.1 instead of a stereo - but that still won't put it in sync."
5,Classic Peter Gabriel,"I was only a so so fan of Peter Gabriel's until I saw this concert on TV one night and it solidified me as a permanent fan. Great mix of songs performed here along with good back up vocals from Paula Cole. She is quite good in her own right especially during her performance for 'don't give up', very touching song. I am not sure how to qualify Peter Gabriel, rock, pop maybe a little of both but many of his songs can really move you personally.Peter J. Miller"
5,Peter Gabriel - Secret World Live,"Saw this concert on HBO years ago... loved it... Been about 15 years since I've seen it, it is still incredible!!The rest of the band is awesome!! And I thought Paula Cole did a fantastic job! Well worth the purchase, I would definitely recommend."
2,poor quality,"i was counting the days,waiting for this dvd to come and now that i have finally got it,i am very disappointed!i hate being negative like this but i really didnt like what i heard and saw.first of all the video/audio is out of synch.its not a big deal(someone would say)but the whole time i had the feeling im watching via satellite.but what really bothered me was the remix,and the fact that i did not hear many things i was expecting to hear. entire passages that are on the cd were missing(example:drum solos on ""shaking the tree"").and i really do not understand why this has been done.i have listened to the cd 1000 times,and i know every small detail.further more i consider it one of the most beautiful pieces of so called pop music recorded and i think things should have been left just the way they were.for me as a result of this remix some great pieces of music have been lost on the dvd.i was really disappointed to see all this damage done to such a masterpiece."
5,This IsThe Best Video Concert Out There!!!,"Everyone else who has reviewed this tape has said it all...It's Amazing!! I wanted to let you all know that there is a companion CD-ROM GAME called ""EVE"". If you LOVE this video like everyone else does, you MUST get the ""EVE"" adventure as well ...HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!!!!"
3,RKL,"I ordered this for a friend. She reimbursed me. At this point I'm unsure whether the disc is defective orincompatible with her older DVD player, but she called on Monday the 21'st of March, 2011 and informed me.I may end up trying to return it. She said she'd test it on my DVD player before she would ask me to do that.Because of the confusion, I can only give a potential notice of return and an OK rating."
3,Great yet disappointing,"Fantastic sound quality and great to view it in wide screen, but did anybody think to try and improve the video quality?"
2,The VHS was better,"I am a musician and my first choice in having any gig I wanted would be Peter Gabriel. I first bought the 2 CD set which I found astounding. Then, a couple of years later, I bought the VHS and was floored. I recently bought this DVD and was extremely disappointed. What I was hoping for was the exact same performance on DVD that was on my wornout VHS cassette. What I got was an approach of ""more is always better"". The DVD has been enhanced with guitar overdubs and remixing. The visual portion of the DVD isn't very good quality either. If I knew then what I know now, I would search for another copy of the VHS tape."
1,I think I'm gonna cry....,[$$$] theater system including a plasma TV. Worst DVD I have ever bought. This is my favorite concert of all time and I am so heartbroken! Do yourself a favor and take the video of this show into the kid's room and watch it on your 2 head [...] VCR. You will get a much better playing. Trust me. I'm so disgusted that I can't even write anymore.
4,Concert Film that rocks,"I saw it in Netfilx rotation and came here and bought it. Consistent, entertaining and I found myself humming the tunes the next day."
4,Mostly Good Capture of a Tour I Missed,"This was taken from 16mm film, so it's not as sharp as we are used to on blu-ray. But this makes it as good as it can get. Audio is well rounded but I would have preferred more bass punch at times. The highlight songs are ""San Jacinto"" and ""Shaking the Tree."" I absolutely hated ""Kiss That Frog"" and ""Digging in the Dirt"" and will skip those the next time I play this. It's nice to have a good Peter Gabriel concert with a head of hair."
3,"Keep the dvd, skip the blu-ray...","Let me start by saying this is a fantastic concert. Very imaginative in its staging and execution, and visually deserves 4 or 5 stars, not the 3 that I gave it. HOWEVER, having owned the dvd since its original release several years ago I was disappointed in how, with the new audio mix, they went for a more ""lush"" sound that, I feel, sucks all the energy out of the performance. With the old dvd version, the DTS audio gives the bass and drums a ""presence"" they just don't have in the new mix. Also, even though I had been upset over the exclusion of ""Red Rain"" from the original release, I now see why they cut it - it's lifeless.The blu-ray, while the footage looks better, was a big let-down. Amazing that you could get so very different impressions from the same concert."
4,Some Great Moments Here,"As with all of Peter Gabriel's projects, this one ranges from pedestrian to good to GREAT. If it wasn't for the rather grainy (it was filmed in a European auditorium full of cigarette smoke, I guess) image quality, I would give it five stars overall. Musically it IS five stars."
1,"Wonderful concert, horrible DVD","This is a great performance by a really exciting performer backed by a first-rate band. Unfortunately, this DVD contains the worst video transfer I've ever seen, with compression artifacts visible throughout. I'm not crazy about the audio mix, but don't hate it as much as some other reviews I've read. But I think a campaign needs to be started to demand a re-issue of this DVD with the problems fixed."
2,Great concert...Poor video and sound quality,"I agree with all the other negativ ratings. Just one addition, the DTS Soundtrack is simply unusable."
1,This is NOT the 1994 concert...,"I have watched the 1994 concert several times on Directtv when they show it. I've looked high and low for a DVD of that concert. So, when I saw this dvd and some people claiming this was the 1994 concert....I bit. Big mistake.The picture on this dvd is poor. The sound not much better. But what really disappointed me is the fact that this is a highlight reel from the 1994 concert. There are so many cuts from the real concert that it is like trying to watch a classic movie that has been reduced to scene highlights.If you think you are buying the 1994 concert dvd you will be sorely disappointed. This has to be the most disappointing dvd I have ever purchased. Anyone want it I will gladly send it for cost of postage...otherwise, in the trash. (If you really want the songs save your eyes and get the CD)"
1,5 Star Reviews ...I bought it....I HATE it......,"I guess I don't hate it BUT...I bought this because of all the great reviews I saw on Amazon.com...I hear know great musicians here, there ok, but nothing extrordinary...Some reviewer said the stage was great or something...wow...A tree comes up...and a dome comes down...I say this performance and DVD is a master of mediocrity..."
4,Peter Gabriel - Secret World Live,GREAT DVD! I loved it! Understand there was a DVD for the SO Live concert also but can't locate it.
1,Overhyped concert.,"I like Peter Gabriel. I loved his music with Genesis. I loved ""Shock the Monkey"". And I loved his ""So"" album. But this concert, I did not like. The reason being that he lip-synchs throughout the show. Apparently, this is done to enhance the actual ""showiness"" of the concert. That might be ok, if there were an interesting story or theme to become involved in, but here it was all just so boring. I just couldn't take the fakeness of it all. In addition, the song selection did not flow together. Did I mention this concert was boring? Sorry to all fans of Peter Gabriel. As I said, I think he's made great music in the past (I have every CD he made with Genesis), but this was not his finest hour."
4,ITS REALLY POSSIBLE,"There is no question that F.W.H. Myers was an outstanding individual. That is a FACT. It is also a FACT that the human being only uses approximately 10% of their mind. (Unless you're a politician, then it's much less). Be that as it may, just think how people would have thought you ""crazy"" just 30 years ago if you told them about devises ie: cell phones, hand held computers or Fax machines.The 90% of our ""unused"" brain contains other such ideas and thoughts we're not able to grasp as yet. So why then do we dismiss research such as F.W.H. Myers, Dr. Michal Sabom MD, Raymond Mooney PhD, Kenneth Ring Phd & Dr. Elisabeth Kuber-Ross, PhD, MD., etc. when they tell us that their in-depth research has established the fact that After-life exists?"
5,Harbingers,"Excellent continuation to the story. Good tie back to Conspiracies. I have been reading F. Paul Wilson's books since the ""The Keep"" first came out in the early 80s and I can say that his readers will not be dissapointed. Can't wait to see the next in the series!"
5,does the job,"I bought this to use when I tape hockey games. I set up on a counter top in a press box so I do not extend the legs. Good range of motion. Pros may want more but it works fine for me. I have also used it with a still camera for taking some landscape pictures, it is nice for when I use a slow shutter speed, I set a timer and don't get the blurriness. Had it about four years and definitely gotten my money's worth out of it."
3,"easy to operate, but high on power use","It is easy to switch between modes of the camera. The included video cable allows you to display video or photos on a t.v. with the setting of only one option.It seems to eat batteries though. I was surprised when after shooting a few minutes of video and taking 8 photos with the LCD screen on, I didn't have enough battery power to download them onto my computer. In two days, I had used up 3 new pairs of AA alkaline batteries. Perhaps that is normal - this is my first digital camera. The service department recommended I buy lithium rechargeable batteries."
5,More should know this story,"This story is very dear to me. I discovered my copy of it when I was in elementary school. It was very old (about fifty years) so I thought I would be mysterious. It was. It is a very sweet tale about Cinders, Cinderella's coachman whom the fairy godmother forgot to turn back into a mouse. The sweet librarian who worked at my school noticed how much I loved it, and since no one had checked it out in years (except me who kept renewing it) she gave it to me. I love it and when I have children, they will know it just as well, if not better than all those other fairy tales. Someone should dress it up and reprint it for future generations."
5,love the mogami cable,"theres no other choice when purchasing mic cables,especially this mogami gold cable.i love it,it sounds amazing with my mxl mic and m-audio phantom power interface.the price was very low compared to going to a music store and delivery was quick but this cable is the best any musician can get,period."
5,"even though im not, t-of-r makes me feel sexy.","i was lucky enough hear these guys in princeton a few weeks ago along with two other fantastic bands, million time winner & palomar. t-of-r rocked so hard i couldn't even believe it. i heard the cd and expected a great show, but their live show blew me away! they brought to life all the emotion, humor, romp and rock of the music and the band members. do yourself a favor, if you ever get the opportunity to see them live, go! this is one of my favorite rock bands. i won't be surprised if they become, ""The Next Big Thing."" love, Blazer."
4,Good,This is one that would be nice to see on kindle. It is a simple guide to some basic druidry. Alot of it isn't just for druidesses either.
1,Huge disappointment!!,"When I saw the previews for Bag of Bones I was all excited, but I missed it when it was on TV. Bought it on Amazon and now I wish I didn't. The book was so good but this show was a huge disappointment :(."
3,Just,a short trailer now I want to see more but was not worth my time when I could have gone to YouTube & watched it.
2,Not a Good Fright Time for Me,"This lost my attention ten minutes in. It was stupid, flat and boring and I never finished it. It didn't live up to Steven King's other works."
4,Good.,"As always, Stephen King knows how to deliver a story. This is no exception and for those who like his work, they won't be disappointed."
4,All the King stories are Great,I loved the tree!! it was the creepiest thing i have seen in a long time. and the gay brother is great.. this is a King that must be seen
5,Outstanding recording,"This is one of the Collectio Argentea recordings issued by Archiv in the 1980s. Sadly, this particular cd is especially hard to find, although it is relatively easy to find the vinyl version, which includes only the Vivaldi cantatas on the cd with an additional aria by Vivaldi.Recorded in the late 1970s, the performance is nevertheless very modern sounding since it features some of the best early music performers. The Vivaldi is sung by Rene Jacobs, countertenor with Alan Curtis and his Complesso Barocco. The Bononcini is performed byRene Jacobs, countertenor; Sigiswald Kuijken, violin; Lucy van Dael, violin; Wieland Kuijkin, violoncello and Robert Kohnen provides the harpsichord basso continuo.The highlight of the cd is the cantata Amor hai vinto, which is a real delight.Vivaldi:Cessate, omai cessateO mie porpore piu belleAmor hai vintoBononcini:Siedi, Amarilli miaCare luci del mio bene"
1,Dull and useless,"This was a total disappointment. I was looking for a basic instructional video for my son - simple pointers on hand position, review of the keyboard, etc... The video jumps right into watching the host sing and play a few chords."
3,A Disturbing Look at Small Southern Town Life,"Meet the Hunchback of Colin Hill and other characters in Studstill's thinly veiled semi-autobiographical novel. I read the book with interest, trying to figure out who the characters in the book were. Colin Hill is based on Madison, FL where Studstill grew up. I asked some of the old timers who the characters may be in the book. If the book hadn't been about my hometown, I probably would have lost interest in it!"
1,DISPLEASED WITH PRODUCT,"THE INSTRUCTIONS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPLIED BY PALM TO ENABLE ME TO TRANSFER MY DATA FROM A PALM IIIc TO THE CURRENT PRODUCT LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED. I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS AS PER THE INTERNET AND COULD NOT ACHIEVE THE TRANSFER OF DATA. IN ADDITION, THERE IS NO TELEPHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO GET HELP. AS FAR AS I AM CONSERNED, THE PRODUCT IS A DUD AND NOT WORTH ANY ADDITIONAL TIME ON MY PART TRYING TO GET IT TO ACHIEVE WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR. AS OF RIGHT NOW IT IS OF NO USE TO ME."
5,Palm Pilot Praise,I'm happy with my purchase of the Tungsten II Palm.....it has all the features I need and it's easy to read. I would recommend this product.
2,E2 Warranty Not Worth the Price,"I bought the warranty after reading that the E2 screen was easily damaged. Mine got damaged right away. After a lot of effort with Palm, I finally got a replacement. But it was obviously a refurbished model that someone else had returned. It never did work right, and lasted only about 6 months before failing completely. A second repair is not covered. I'm looking for another manufacturer for a more reliable PDA."
4,"Not for college, but great for the work world","The main thing I did not like about this product is that using it for a college schedule is not ideal. It is difficult to put homework in and you aren't able to easily view you week at a glance with it pointing out exams, quizzes, homework, and other assignments. For the work world I can imagine this product being GREAT! It is just easier for me to see my exams, etc. when it is written on paper."
5,Excellent,"Love it! Needed an upgrade to an older PDA, this is perfect, up to date, color, easy to manage. Able to sync my work & home calendars & contacts so they are always up to date and match each other. This PDA allows multiple categories for multiple contacts. Very glad I purchased it!"
4,good product quick shipping,"The product shipped very quickly even though i chose the slower shipping method it came in like 2 days.The pda itself works good,it looked almost new when i got it, just the one issue i have when the battery power gets depleted and i recharge it the pda will not turn back on with out pushing the reset button in the back and then i need to reset the time and date."
4,Used Palm Tungsten review,"I have purchased three Palm Zire 31s and one used Palm One which I discovered was a clunker. The Palm 31s performed well but failed without warning and if I had not had the connection to my Outlook would have lost my contact list and calendar. The current Palm Tungsten is performing well and is easier to use and the screen is brighter than others I have had. But again, it is important to back up your data. MM"
1,Tungsten E2 was defective,"I ordered this product with the assurance that it would be a replacement for the one I had. Instead, the first time I started it up, I went into the touch screen to tune the stylus on the screen. The Tungsten E2 froze ion this screen in a known irreparable endless loop that indicates a dead device. Palm cannot fix this problem. I know because the Tungsten E2 I was replacing 'died' with this exact same problem. I give them a very low rating because they are selling product without knowing whether it will work or not. It seems to be a great waste of my time and not reliable.The 1 star rating I gave them is because they promptly sent a return label and refunded my money.Buyer beware.Joanna"
3,Not Too Impressed,Received it as a Christmas gift and I regret to say that I am not too impressed. I was hoping that it would have more comprehensive features and be up to date with the latest techno. features. Unfortunately it has not lived up to my expectations. I will say that it is attractive and very easy to navigate though the screens LCD doesn't have the highest resolution
3,Tungsten,"Sad there is nothing on the market that is compatible with the latest Windows, that can store names addresses, passwords etc, all password protected and that can sync with my PC periodically."
2,nice but can't use,"I purchased the Palm Tungsten E2 handheld to replace one that I had for years and it finally wore out. When I tried to download the cd that came with the tungsten it couldn't complete the download, it isn't compatable with microsoft vista. The software had not been updated for vista."
1,It's my 4th and last Palm,"Discouraged lower-level user here. I wanted a PDA, not a phone, so I got 4th PDA since 1998--a Tungsten E2. Since nobody in my town retails them any more, bought online (great Amazon service.)Still can't get E2 to sync with Outlook. I'm willing to settle for syncing with Palm Desktop Software, have read blogs, tried several fixes, still no joy. Lack of support seems a deal-breaker. MS Vista doesn't support online Help in Palm Desktop Software. You need Google to find help on Palm's web site. Trying to avoid spending $50 more for 3rd party patch just to make it do the basic deal: be my handheld, and get backed up."
4,Handy little device,"I got the Palm Tungsten for my wife to use. She really likes it.It's a handy little device to store her address book, with email. Keep track of appointments and make lists.She also uses it to sync with the home and work computers to transfer a few files.A good price on a great little organizer."
1,Palm is GARBAGE,do NOT buy ... I have had a e2 AND a Palm Lifedrive ... both have had loving care but broke within a year. Customer service will gladly fix it for $150 so unless you plan to spend an adverage of $20 a month for this .. BEWARE and dont buy!!!
5,Great PDA for excellent price,"This PDA stores photos, mp3's, and all the information I need in a compact, light package. Excellent value."
3,Hardware good - software ??,"This is the 3rd Palm device I have owned so I am familiar with the operation and features. This one is a feature rich device. The software included has provided nothing but frustration trying to get the included software to properly sync with the device. I ended up with duplicated contacts in my address book - over 300 of them. Calendars not syncing properly and then the device just locking up which requires a complete deletion of files on the Palm and starting over again. This may be a problem with the MAC operating system, but the prior Palm devices worked with the same OS X system. I have used Palm's support and they have offered suggestions - but the problems are still there.I am sure this will be eventually resolved - it has just made many of the features I purchased this new unit for unavailable."
1,"Get black spot within a week, and makes it very hard to use","I purchased a hard case so I can carry in aback pocket. I got a black spot on the screen.this makes it very hard to use.I love the Palm and have had one for years, never had a black spot before. Would like to have a replacementSteve SvandaMichiesvan@aol.com"
2,Palm Tungsten E2 review,"The On and off switch died shortly after 90 day warantee was up and sadly, nothing could be done about it."
3,Hate the buzzing noise,"It works fine like all the all Palm I have. I got this because of the color screen. But boy, what a pain now that I have to deal with the buzzing noise from the screen. I'm really thinking of upgrading this just because of the noise. Maybe this is what Palm wants!"
1,Fatal error,"I just puchased the Tugsten E2 to replace my old Sony CLIE. It synced up with my computer the first try out of the box. At my next attempt at a sync, I got fatal eror and lost all the data on my computer. Now i can't sync and have no backup of my data. I've tried every trick from Palm and the user forums, the answer may be to do a total reset which will lose all my data. I'm ready to toss this unit out the window"
4,Great improvement over the Tungston E,"The best feature of the E2 is the improved battery life. Whereasthe old E will exhaust the battery in 4 hours of usage and emptyin a couple of days when not being used, the new E2 stands up tomany hours of continuos use."
1,Unreliable handheld,"I thouhght this was a great handheld when I first got it, but after two months I found it dead one morning. None of the recommended procedures revived it. I sent it back to Palm and after a week and half it was returned. It worked for 2 weeks and then it died again. I told Palm tech support I wanted a new one since this is obiously defective. They refused to give me a new one and said they would fix this again. The cost of using this device goes up considerably when you consider that all the time you spend on the phone with these people is on your nickel. They do not have an 800 number. Then there is the cost of shipping it back to them (they do not pay for return shipping) And finally there is the inconvenience of being with out the device for the week and a half that it takes to fix it. Between service and reliability issues, I would recommend buying a handheld from anonther company."
2,Lasted a few months only..,"I've been a palm user for many years, from Zire to Tungsten E and then E2. I was impressed by the cost and the new features of E2. However one fine day, 4 months after its purchase, it hung up during hotsync and even the soft and the hard reset aren't working. It totally died, and I've no idea what caused it.I would not recommend Tungsten E or E2 to anyone who wants to keep it for sometime, as their operating systems are vulnerable and thats the reason palm only gives a 90 day warranty on them, compared to 1 year for Tungsten T5 and TX.Its small 32MB memory is too small for any professional user, so invest a little more and get the more high end models."
1,over 50 users have the same problem,"I've had my E2 for around 7 months and it just suddenly wouldn't turn on. There was no warning, it had worked fine the day before, there weren't any battery problems and NONE of the possible trouble shooting suggestions would work. It is completely dead and no data are accessible.I couldn't get it to sync or charge from either the AC charger or USB trickle charge. When I went on Palm One forum, it became evident that over 50 other E2 users have had this problem and Palm isn't responding. This is my second Palm PDA and I'm done with Palm sadly. I'd say buyer beware. If you have questions about this, check out the Palm One forum for possible problems before buying!"
2,Don't buy this device,"My prior experience with Palm was always a little frustrating, but since the device I had worked reasonably well (m515), I overlooked their poor customer service. No longer. My trusty m515 had to be replaced because it went missing, and the E2 looked like a good bet for what I needed. Unfortunately, the happy story ends there.My Palm E2 was in warranty when I got the ""grey screen of death"". Palm repaired it. It has happened again, but this time, one month later than the additional 3 months warranty they tacked on (within 7 months: total of two repairs/replacements needed). My option -- $150 to have Palm fix ""my"" problem. I will never buy another Palm. And I won't recommend the devices any longer to my friends and business associates. This company does not back up their products and seems to think they are throw aways. Which is what I'm about to do -- throw it away."
2,really poor plugs,"As usual, Palm doesn't improve with later versions. The sync and power plugs are much worse than the Tungsten E. They have plastic tabs and little metal prongs, and to put both in at the same time you have to force them together. I have had very bad luck with palm service under warranty so now I buy the cheapest I can and consider them ""disposable"". The Tungsten E2 does nothing to change my mind. No wonder they have no feedback button on their website, but I did fax them about the plugs. They are the worst I've ever seen and will break sooner rather than later. Also, after installing their new software which told me it had deleted some 3rd party programs that might not work, it still wouldn't sync without a fatal error every time. So their software isn't great, either. Wish I had another palm platform choice, other than a palm product."
1,beware Palms limited warranty,"Its a great little device but I have never been able to get the bluetooth to work with my spint phone. Now at just over 120 days my connector in the bottopm of the palm has failed. Palm will not repair or replace the unit. I paid $25 to find out I need to buy a refurbished unit for $150, nearly the full retail price. Beware of the lousy 90 day warranty !"
2,Lasted only six months,I was very happy with the device until it stopped working after only six months. Fortunately I backed up my information regularly and so didn't lose any. Now I am faced with the prospect of buying a new PDA. I'm sad to say the new one is unlikely to be a Palm. Manufacturers must be able to balance economical prices with reliability. What's the point of giving you low prices if you have to replace the units often.Makes no sense to me.
3,"Good performance, but very poor quality","I have been using a Palm product, T5 or E2's for a number of years and when they work they're great. However I have been very disappointed in the reliability and quality of each of these products. It seems that after a year, with very limited use, it crashes and burns and you're left with repairing it (which will take months) for more money than you could buy a new one. Each one either just crashed with a total failure or more commonly, the ON/OFF switch on the top would stop working. It has been a very frustrating as well as expensive experience buying a new unit every year. I think I'm going to try a different company next time."
1,"Bad battery, bad service, bad warranty",I have owned two of these in the last two years. Both have died without trauma. The warranty of 90 days is inadequate for a $200 product. It seems their made in china battery suddenly dies leaving one high and dry when you need the palm information the most and the battery will not recharge. It stays totally dead despite recharge. I was able to fix one for now with a new battery from ebay.... for now. I would avoid this product or buy the extended warranty and plan on having it out of service.
4,great little handheld,"I use this handheld for nursing school and I've been able to purchase reference books online, use ereader, and have all I need for clinicals at my fingertips. The handheld is a nice pocket size for carrying, but the included ""case"" is nothing but a screen cover so I've had to purchase a case. I use an extra 1 gig memory card for all my programs (inexpensive way to carry a lot of information). I give this a 4 star rating due to the hotsync connection, it's a little loose, so I can't move the unit while syncing or I lose the connection. I've also had to order a cradle for this use which would have been a nice addition to the unit as purchased. Overall I like this unit, but have had to make several other purchases to suit my needs."
3,Tungsten E2 problems,"I purchased the E2 to replace an older M505. The screen is much clearer, crisper and brighter. It has more memory and is faster; however, I can't get it to sync with any of the Outlook features. It has a problem with Contacts, memos, to do and mail. The error message is not very clear and Palm's answer appears to be the purchase of a third party piece of software that does not have the excellent features of Datebook5, my current datbook manager. I'm more than frustrated as the unit is fine except for the hot sync problem."
2,"works -- most of the time, but . . .","Loved it initially - lets me store ready-access data (I'm an emergency physician and keep the PDR and Tarascon and Merck data on it) and to-do lists and a fair calendar. But when it decides to lock up (about every 2 weeks, have no clue as to why) it takes repeated re-boots to get it to work again. And the battery -- my unit lasts for perhaps an summed hour (at most) of intermittent use. I finally got tired of this, bought a new battery and installed it, and it still drains the NEW battery in an hour. If it leave it sitting in off mode for more than 24 hrs, the battery is dead. In spite of all of this, the thing is still LIGHT YEARS ahead of the HP IPAQ I foolishly bought a few years back."
5,Tungsten E2 Handheld,"When I purchased the handheld, I knew nothing about them, however as I played around with the device, I found that it is a very useful, compact device. The information it contains is very helpful.Unfortunately, I purchased a pre-owned unit and did not receive any information with it, but there is a wealth of information on the 'net to help with the use of this unit. I'm looking forward to hours of enjoyment as I obtain the necessary accessories for the unit."
4,Good choice for a first PDA,Very nice product for a first PDA. Easy to use and long battery life are awesome. If only it can support larger SD card and perhaps WiFi or support bluetooth of more cell phone...
3,Satisfied,"Although the item ordered (E2) is not what was sent (E), seller made prompt efforts to work with me to reach an agreement. I did not get what I wanted but am satisfied with the outcome and appreciate seller's willingness to work with me (doesn't always happen). I have no doubt once I replace the battery the battery life will improve drastically."
3,"All in all, a step down from previous palms","I bought this to replace an M500 that eventually broke, and am disapointed. It is less stable, has more sync problems, and is generally less robost as a pim manager. Yes, there are some neat new functions, but they are mostly gloss, and don't augment the basic tasks I want it for, or make up for the fact that the basic tasks are now more difficult.I wish Palm still made the M500."
1,Digitizer dying at age 3 months,"I bought my Tungsten E2 on 3/8/06, as of 6/22/06 the digitizer is malfunctioning. The area of the digitizer where one taps on 'details' no longer responds reliably to tapping. Recalibrating the digitizer has no effect. I've seen this happen on a few Palm devices (Vx, Samsung i500), but never so quickly.I warranty is 90 days, a good clue to Palm's opinion of this device. The Lifedrive has a 1 year warranty.This device is still covered by my AMEX extended warranty and I'll probably get my money back this way.In retrospect I should have noticed how short the warranty period was on this device and that other, more costly, devices had a 1 year warranty. Stay away from any device with a 90 day warranty."
2,Buyer Beware,"I loved this device out of the box - it had everything I needed, with good interface and efficent features. It synced well with Outlook Express and the bluetooth function was seamless.It died after 6 months, and palm's support to tell me to send it in to have it ""serviced"" (160.00) with no guarantees of it being returned in working condition.To make a very long story short, the battery was fried. I did not charge it abnormally nor did I ever misuse the PDA in a manner for which it was unintended. Palm does not sell replacement batteries, but I imagine that the ""service"" would have simply involved replacing the faulty battery. Please note that a replacement battery is NOT available from Palm.After this happened, I went online and found that the same thing had happened to a number of users. While the majority of users have not had a problem with their device, I would beware buying this model as it seems that a small percentage happen to arrive as lemons."
1,Dead after than 6 months,"I received Palm Tungsten E2 from Amazon on May, 2006. It had battery problem (battery exhausted very faster even unused) from the beginning. It is dead today. The screen displayed irregular black shapes, some yellow curves and white. Even hardware reset could not bring up the PDA. I visited Palm site and learned that it cost as much to repair as to buy a new one and it only had 90 days warranty. I have Sony Clie SJ22 for over three years and it is still working. I wonder if the quality difference that Sony is manufactured in Japan while Tungsten is made in China?"
3,"Eh, It's Ok",First i need to say the battery life is HORRIBLE. My husband has and E2 and his is wonderful.Second i got it on mother's day 2006 and on 7/20 the on off button caved in. NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT!I love the color coding. that is the best feature. To be able to assign each family member a color and sort by color. I like that can put a ton of information in the contacts.But to spend $200 plus on this........um no.
2,Shipped Defective,"This product was shipped defective. After receiving a complete charge to the batteries, it wouldn't turn off. The vendor has quickly taken responsibility and I have returned the product for replacement. It is still frustrating when a product is shipped when already defective."
1,Product was defective,"Since I had earlier ordered a Palm Tungsten E2Handheld from Amazon before and it was in working condition upon arrival, I had the confidence that I could do the same for a gift purchase.However, when I received the product and gave it as a gift, it turned out that the receipient could not use it as the product was defective. The right hand side of the screen did not respond to taps by the stylus and could not scroll easily either. I was embarrassed by this as I had given the product as a gift.I have since returned the product via Customer Returns last Wednesday and would expect to have a full refund as soon as possible."
3,Not the Palm Quality of before - Gives me headache,"Nice screen and look. BUT, it has a high pitched humming noise that is driving me crazy. The Palm website sayd its normal and just the way it is. If high pitched whining sounds make you crazy, do not get the E2.By the way, normally, noises don't bother me. But I can not get used to this noise.This is the first Palm or any device that makes this sound."
1,Sudden Death,"It worked well until it did not turn on 7 months after purchasing it.The repair charge is $149 for a machine that will cost $180 new.Unfortunately, It runs software that I use everyday at work. I'm purchasing another one because I have no other choice. Very, Very disappointed.Potential Palm customers. Beware before you invest time and money in this pda."
2,"Useful, but inadequate quality","Problems with the digitizer are too common, not long after the short warranty expires. But by now we should not expect very much in the way of quality or reliability or durabilty from anything made in china. And unfortuntely too often there is not much choice about it available in the marketplace."
1,bad,"the hardware was out of order after one week of usage,very bad experience,will not recommend t any one"
1,Buyer beware,"No where on the box does it say that this product is not compatible with XP Media Center. Only after not being able to install the software and drilling down into the Palm support site do you find that out. The box simply states it is compatible with ""Windows XP"" Their support is really lacking."
5,Pleased E2 User,"Excellent graphics, great Palm quality. I wanted a simple unit to keep my information. This works flawlessly."
2,A real step down from a Sony Clie',"I've been forced to switch from the tried and true Sony Clie' I bought more than 5 years ago to a Palm, due to a software compatibility issue. Not having a keyboard incorporated into the device slows things down tremendlously and forces me to use both hands to enter grafiti. The Palm is chunky and awkward to hold compared to the elegant design of the Clie'."
2,Not reliable,"While this has all the right features, there are two big problems. First, these palms only last 18 months or so. Then freezes beyond repair. Second, whenever it is on, there is an annoying, constant high pitched buzz. I do not recommend this product."
5,TungstenE2,"I'm a previous user of tungsten E. When my battery died and I needed to replace the battery or buy a new product, I chose to buy the TX because of the added features. I had problems with the application software for TX virtually from the start. So I returned it for an E2. I have not had a problem from the moment I took it out of the box. I sacrificed some desirable features but it's more important to me that I have a reliable access to my data. I'm now a happy camper."
4,Nice basic PDA but the sync system stinks,The Tungsten E2 is a good choice for a basic PDA at a reasonable price. But the sychronization connection system leaves a lot to be desired. The handheld is plugged in a computer with a USB2 cord that has a very fragile-looking plug on the handheld end.In addition the plug has to be inserted just so otherwise it won't sync with the computer. There is an optional cradle that can be purchsed but appearently it is only available in a $50 kit that includes adaptors for foreign voltages--a kit that costs a quarter of the price of the E2. In general the plug-in system needs a redesign.The E2 comes with a flimsy flip cover. Aftermarket covers or cases should be purchsed for better protection.
2,Terrible Quality Control,"Great when it works, but that hasn't been often. Good luck dealing with ""customer service."" My Palm cust. service highlight was when they told me the annoying, very loud, high-pitched buzz is ""normal"". The wireless keyboard is just as bad. Avoid!"
1,Died suddenly after 12 days & could not be reset,"This was my third Palm Tungsten E2. My first Palm PDA, a Palm V, lasted five years. My first Tungsten E2 lasted a little over two years. My second one lasted a little less than two years. This one lasted a whoppin' 12 days! All of my Tungsten E2s, even when working, were flaky -- they buzzed, they had to be reset often, their conduits quit working and I could not back them up to my computer. Customer ""support,"" when I tried it years ago, was so useless it was insulting. I'm not even going to try for a refund, I'm just never going to buy a Palm product again. Unfortunately, none of the other PDAs seem very reliable either. Much as I dislike the bulk and inefficiency of paper, I'm going back to it until some wonderful company makes a reliable PDA."
1,frozen pda,"This is the fourth pda I have owned. I have never had a problem with the others just a silly need to get the latest gadget.The Tungsten e2 I ordered only worked for a week. I am a hairdresser and I keep all my appointments for the year in this thing. The pda froze up and will not turn off or on. I have done everything possible, reset the thing reinstalled my software etc. I contacted the seller and they told me to send it back in the original package. The package I got had been opened and no plastic on it just a box. OOPs I never thought I would have to send it back and the package is somewhere far far away recycled. I am just so disappointed. Don't know what I will do but in the mean time I transfered all my data from my computer to paper."
2,Remember!,"Please remember, when the battery dies (and it will die!), there is no remedy. There is no replacement battery and no service department. You are dead and presumably, expected to purchase a new unit. Bull pucky!"
1,I don't recommend this one,"I have an old Palm Zire that I have used for several years. It does nothing fancy, but it is totally dependable. I ordered the new Palm Tungsten E2 for the really nice screen and other amenities. Here's the good and the bad.The bad first:The cable that hooked the new Palm to the computer connected, but would not disconnect. The software was messy.The good:I kept my old Palm Zire and reinstalled its software and am back in business.I returned the new Palm and Amazon, as always, was most cooperative.I gave the tungsten one star bacause the screen was really nice. I can't vouch for anything else because I never had the chance to use it.Don't purchase this Palm."
2,Palm Tungstun E doesn't hold power after a year,"I loved my handheld when I first got it, but after only a year, the battery goes dead after I play one song on my mp3. When I called Palmto see about getting the battery changed, they told me it would cost$130 to get a new one. Wow!!They have a trade up policy now where they will send you a few dollarsto use for your next PDA, but I really don't want another handheld now because this battery problem will probably happen again next year if I decide to purchase another PDA.I am now looking for a new unit where I can use my SD cards and play all my recorded music and I'll buy myself a paper planner for all my records."
4,I'm a happy camper,"I resisted upgrading my Sony Clie T615C, which has been at death's door for a while now, because I thought the transfer of data would be a pain between the two makers. Plus, I didn't need all the extras being touted now - MP3 player, voice recorder, on-board camera, etc., and wasn't looking forward to making the buying ""decision"". I made my decision, though, and am tickled. The color is beautiful, the speed is peppy, and I'm grateful to be joining the 21st century, having just added some songs to my expansion card. P.S. The transfer of data went very smoothly."
1,"If I could rate this a negative number, I would.","I bought this as my first palm in October and was very happy for the first couple of months. Then it was like it developed a mind of it's own -Reminder alarms going off for no reason - - and no way to shut them off - - it just beeps until IT decides to stop.Buttons completely unresponsive - won't turn on, won't shut off - - sometimes.Sometimes it will turn on but in a diffrent application than what I attempted to access.When accessing the calendar, it will sometimes start fast forwarding past every day and won't stop until it has run through several minutes.The stylus may or may not work to access programs.Customer service? Forget it. Their recommendation is to buy a new one, and that is also the recommendation of service techs at Best Buy and others. I may have been behind the times with a paper-type Franklin Planner, but at least I was in control!"
1,Tungsten E2 won't turn on,"There is a problem with the E2, after some time, for me it was 6 months, it just stops working. No matter what type of reset you perform the unit will not turn on. Leave the unit for a week or disconnect the battery and something resets and it starts working again. There are many people having the exact same problem, however Palm takes no responsibility for this defect and blames the problem on 3rd Party Apps. I have an extended warranty but I am waiting for the E2 to be obsolete before I act on it, I don't want my unit replaced with another defective unit. It's a good pda for the money, when it works it does what it is supposed to do. Until this defect is fixed I would not recommend the E2. And since I have been disappointed by Palms customer support I cannot recommend any of their products."
1,Horrendous....I give this Zero stars...,"I bought the Tungsten E2 after doing much research on it and I was hoping for a great product..I was wrong. The product itself, if the thing actually worked, would be great. Like many of the users here that left comments, after using my Palm for about a week, it just did not turn on. I sent it back twice so far and it will work for a few days and then...dead. I put another call into Palm but they give me the runaround and want me to give them my credit card info so they can send me a ""refurbished"" item and I have to send the dead one back. No thanks. I would not trust them with my credit info. Anyway, this is a horrible product..not so much a horrible product, horrible customer service and warranty. I'd give anything to have my old Sony Clie back..I loved that thing!!"
1,It's fried,"I bought the Palm Tungsten E2 Handheld PDA about three months ago. In the meantime, I've spent almost $200 in software and an SD card. It was totally loaded as I wanted. I had only recharged four times, at most. Everything was perfect, I was in love.Then a fatal error. Recovered from that. Then, another fatal error. I lost access to all programs on main harddrive(?). When I tried to reformat and start over, I couldn't get back to the main menu. No resetting, nothing. When it was off, I noticed that there was a burned spot in the screen. It's fried.Back to the drawing board. I'm almost forced to go back to Palm because of the investment I have in software.Needless to say, PLEASE don't buy this piece of junk."
1,BAD PRODUCT / BAD COMPANY,"This is the third Palm PDA I have owned. I bought the E2 directly from Palm after my previous palm died. It simply quit shortly after the warranty expired. Telephone support is poor and expensive. After research this is a common problem.My employer pays for PDA's for executives and since I approve of all of these products, I will hereafter not allow any purchase of any Palm product based on falty products, poor customer support and extremely poor customer support."
4,95% in love...,"...and 5% in *hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate* with the graffiti update. Even though this PDA allows you to write with ""normal"" characters (rather than graffiti morphed characters), the panel doesn't translate as liberally if I'm not precise (and pressing hard...which makes the stylus slip between my fingers), and I ***can't write as fast as I could with my old IIIc.*** ****Kinda defeats the whole purpose of the entire PDA idea!!****"
1,Do not buy this product!,"I am on my third E2 and this one just died less than nine months after I bought it. My second one died after 366 days. I called Palm and was told the repair would be $149 and I would be without my device for several weeks. I paid $257.95 for this one, through Amazon, for nine months of use. However, when I spoke with Palm again, they told me that this unit was manufactured in 2005 and the battery shelf life would have been far exceeded at the point of sale. They stopped even making these units three years ago, so any being sold now would also have inadequate batteries. Also, Palm is not agreeing to meet the one year warranty since the unit is so old, even though it was purchased nine months ago."
1,Do not buy this,"The batteries on these are horrible. They don't last long, even with special care. They are difficult to replace, and utterly unreliable. Design-wise, it's just what I wanted for a PDA...but I would not recommend anyone paying more than $20 for this thing."
4,It does the job,"My wife uses the Palm Tungsten E2. It performs the simple jobs she needs like schedule, phone book notes and showing pictures very well. The battery life is good. The battery indicator and recharging feature sure makes it easier than the old Palm she had which seemed to die suddenly. We are now going to try using it as an MP3 player with the ! GB card that we use for storing pictures."
1,Very unhappy,"very unhappy with the product, every time I tryed to sync I had to giggle the cord so that it will make a conection. I would not buy another used product again."
1,Absolute piece of junk,"Warning, this is a compete waste of money! First off, if your Palm has a problem after the warranty, there is zero customer service. You will be relegated to the forums where other pathetic owners trade ideas on how to fix this electronic piece of junk. Your sync conduits will get screwed up and you'll get messages saying your ""note pad"" is the wrong program (of course it's a Palm program but it and your Palm desktop won't speak the same language anymore). You'll go to the palm support website where you will search for answers using the search function but the site doesn't go anywhere unless you start at Google, and your search results in a Palm support page addressing your problem. There Palm will offer you ""support"" downloads like the ""PIMS update"". Well I just downloaded it and now my Tungsten E2 just keeps trying to turn itself on. Forums will advise you to perform a ""hard reset"" which isn't working. These items are a nightmare."
1,Warning: Very Poor Battery Life,"It worked fine for the first six months then the battery began to take longer and longer to reach a full charge. Currently, it takes about a week if ever to reach a full charge. It has a wireless keyboard that never worked. For what you get, it's really over priced. I can see why they don't make this model anymore. It's a real a lemon. The earlier models worked much longer and were much more reliable. I am so disappointed with Palm. The more features Palms loads into it, the less reliable they seem to get.I still can't figure out why the engineers at Palm try to re-design or fix something that's ""not broken."""
1,What they don't tell you & poor quality control,"You may want to think twice about purchasing this if you have a 64 bit operating system (like Vista). It will not sync with 64 bit Vista with the supplied cable, you end up having to use Bluetooth (which in my case meant another purchase and another delay). Also, the quality control at the factory seems to be questionable. The unit I received had a built in battery which would not take a charge. Once the factory charge ran out, it was totally dead and was impossible to recharge (I followed the directions EXACTLY). The first support person I talked to was very nice but the ""trickle charge"" he suggested did not work. The second person was almost impossible to understand but in the end I ended up having to send the unit back. So much for my wife's birthday present being on time."
1,Horrid,"How sad is this.I've been using my E2 for school work and keeping track of my schedule and after using it for several months, it died. It only works for a few minutes after charging or resetting the device, and if you turn it off(it won't let you keep it on indefinetly) after ten minutes you won't get it to turn on. Even after replacing the battery this problem didn't go away.What to do?Chuck it"
4,Fantastic Organizer!,"I love the Palm Tungsten E2. This is my second one. The first was a refurbished Tungsten. My only complaint is that the battery didn't last too long and it was difficult if not impossible to change unless you had the skill and tools to solder it. However, I liked it enough to purchase the E2 which has a replaceable battery. I refer to this device as ""my other gray matter"" as it has the capacity to store a great deal of information thus eliminating a lot of paper clutter.Marilyn"
1,JUNK,"This is my second PDA from PalmOne. I had high hopes this PDA would last longer than my previous PDA from PalmOne, which lasted two days.Well, to my dismay, after buying all sorts of software and accessories, it broke on DAY TWO!!! Unreal. PalmOne produces abosolute JUNK. Do NOT buy this PDA!"
1,Too Expensive,"My old Palm TX died, and I didn't like it. The browsers are horrible; you can't see anything on the screen, it's too small. I liked the Tungsten E2 I had before it, so I wanted to get another Tungsten E2...but $579! Yikes! No way! I guess my PDA days are over as I don't like Smartphones either (and they have smaller screens than the TX!), especially given they can't communicate directly with the computer (we can't have people using the phone as a modem for the computer now can we?). Too bad, they are a real convenience, especially being able to create EXEL files, but that price is way too out of line for me."
1,Awful support for Windows Vista,"You would think by now that Palm would have figured out that Windows Vista is the software that all of the new Windows based PCs are running now. The best they have for software is a Beta version (yeah, giving you nightmares yet?). The Beta version for Vista and the Tungsten E2 does not support many of the items that the XP compatible software version has AND if you have Vista on one computer and XP on another (ergo - XP on my work laptop and Vista on mhy home computer) it will make your life miserable as it just won't work.I had to dump the Tungstgen E, find and buy the older Tungsten E handheld and install the old version of the software on both computers in order to have my life back again."
1,Amazon got it wrong,"Although we ordered the Palm Tungsten E2, Amazon sent the Palm m515, a much older model. We paid approximately $250 for this. Meanwhile, we ordered the Palm Tungsten EZ through a private party on Amazon and, for ~$125, we got what we ordered. I chose the one star ratings because they did not send the item they want me to rate."
4,Palm Pilot,I am very satisfied with the product although I believe the user instructions could be printed rather than found on the computer.
3,Bought it as a gift,I bought this as gift for my wife years ago. She never got around to using it and now it's probably buried under a pile of other useless electronic devices.I now have an iPhone which is much more fun. My wife may want that instead.I guess I should've considered the need for this Palm device before buying it.
2,Poor Desktop Software,"Palm's desktop software has steadily deteriorated over the years. When you download the latest software, it doesn't save your data from the prior version. It simply wipes it out. So make sure to sync before upgrading, or you will lose data from a simple upgrade. Second, the save feature on the latest software (Version 6.2.2) takes a full ten seconds, using a Windows Vista operating system. This is completely unacceptable, since the machine is locked up for the full ten seconds while the Palm software processes. Third, the font on the desktop software is very small, and cannot be adjusted. Fourth, syncing can be a nightmare. It just not easy, even when you are not trying to sync with a third party software. All in all, Palm used to be a great company; however, I get the impression that it just doesn't care about its customers anymore."
2,does not worth the money!,"I had problems with my PDA the first day I received it.When I called the customer service guy in India, he tried different things to try to solve the weak connection problems(which made it unable to syn) but nothing worked. After 3 years, I am not even able to turn off this PDA. When I tried to push the start/off button on the top right corner or the button at the bottom middle, nothing will happen. It is just a big waste of my battery and money!"
3,VERY GOOD,"I am hooked on the Palm Pilot interact method. I used to prefer the key board, but I eventually accepted the touchscreen and I would never go back.The is an excellent information platform, buy with confidence."
2,Problems with Notepad,"I have had 4 Palm tungsten E2 PDAs. I like the compactness of the PDA.However, the quality of the product has deteroiated and gone downhill.The screen area for the notepad keeps failing and you cannot write notes after just a short while. This product has poor quality control."
3,Not Bad at all,"Ok with the purchase.Thought i would also get the accessories like the USB cable,but.....Still finding the product useful though.It arrived a bit later than i had expected."
4,Tungsten E2,"A dependable PDA with the features (calendar, address book, expansion card slot) I need. No phone, no camera, no movies - which I don't want.On the down side, as a Palm owner for many years, I am annoyed at the need for not infrequent soft resets that seems to have accompanied their development of OS 5."
2,Not as good as the old ones.,"My E2 is one with all the problems you may have heard about. I replaced my E with the E2, despite reading the issues about the digitizer, etc. They were right, the thing is a real lemon. There are goods things, the battery life is great, the screen is bright. But the bad is so bad! The screen won't stay synced very well, it is nearly impossible to use graffiti to write, despite downloading and trying every fix ever suggested. The stylus' silver coating wore down to a brass color in only a few weeks, then its tip fell off. After about 6 months I find that unless I really carefully ensure that the charging cable is seated, it won't charge. Palm really blew it with this unit, they cheaped it to death. I really wish I had bought something else."
5,Tungstons are Amazing,"I'm really glad I got the Tungston. I used to use actual priinted assignment books, and this is a lot more convenient in many ways. It is a little harder to enter in assignments (I could just scribble them down before), but this has so many more features- alarms, setting priorities on tasks, a contact book, and hey, the music player is a great added feature. Other than the fact that entering stuff in is a little slow sometimes (and the feature that supposedly lets you write letters with the stylus and have it transfer that to typed characters is a little glichy), I love everything about it. The notepads great for quickly jotting suff down, and everything is so much more organised. If your the kind of person that needs organization in their life, I would strongly recommend a palm."
3,Tungsten E2,The device itself works extremely well. The battery goes dead quickly and the replacement cost is extremly high (About $150) It's cheaper to buy new one.
2,Not as good as V,"When I reciebed the E2 as a gift I thought nice, i needed a new one (had my PalmV for 5 years). So after i updated the new Palm I was ready to go.I use mine every day, all day, so it got a work out fom day 1. Now the problems 1st it is slower, 2nd, in the middle of writing it freezes and you have to wait for it to catch up, 3rd you cant read it in the sunlight, 4th The battery does not last as long. All in all it has some better features (MP3, bluetooth) than the others but its not all its advertised to be. Actually starts to make me want to look at other brands for a PDA."
1,Tungsten E2,"Tungsten E2 was great, would have rated 4.5 UNTIL I bought a new Computer W2, Now NOT Compatible with Win 7! Now I cannot update other then by hand with clicking on numbers and letters with pen on the machine. Machine might as well be useless. I would never have purchased the Tungsten E2 if I had known this and there is NO warning on the amazon page for it."
3,Absolutely Fine - But outdated,"Mistake #1 - I read the reviews and bought the Zire (Z22).Mistake #2 - Didn't see that the Zire has a tiny screen.-After owning an IIIxe since 2000 I had planned to upgrade to color, but the Zire had a smaller screen and so I shipped it back.Now I've got the E2 and all those other negative and picky reviews are insignificant to the owner pleasure the E2 brings. 1) nice touch screen that's more sensitive 2) no up and down button required just tap the screen 3) relearning a couple new letters not a big deal 4) Seamless Bluetooth sync with my MAC (wow wow wow)Con - I miss the flip up cover on my E2 (big deal? no.)2010 - of course it was a bad purchase as Apple was even then eclipsing it."
5,"Reccomended, the price is good for what you get","I bought this to replace paper calendar and agenda. It's easy to use. Good back light and color. It comes with enough internal memory, you don't have to buy extra memory(card) immediatly. I still don't need it.It's very handy.I was choosing between the Tungsten E and the E2, but for a few bugs more you can get this newer version. The only difference is the Bluetooth. Maybe you won't use this at the beginning, but you never know.I also have the Palm Z22. It's also very good. It just don't support Excel and Word. Also doesn't have an extension slot, although the internal memory still has enough space, you never know if you would need more later. For the rest it's almost the same as the Tungsten E2."
1,Nightmare Palm,"This was the first haldheld I ever got (September/05).It started to work fine but after I deleted a software itgot frozen. After navigating to the support site and spendinghours till I got a representative to talk to (you can do itfor free only in the first 90 days), I was able to doa proper re-set. It worked fine for a while but then itstopped turning on after you turned it off. The only wayto put it back on was by doing a hard reset all the timeyou wanted it to turn on. The warranty period expired (90 days),so to get it fixed I'd have to pay almost the price of a newhand-held."
1,A pile of junk,"I have 3 palm devices, two have failed out of warranty. The latest my Tungsten E2 had a speaker failure 16 days past the meager 90 day warranty - cost to repair $149 plus $35 web charge (more than I paid). Go look it up yourself. My Tungsten E had a power switch fail within 1 year. I can't afford to buy a new one every year can you? I don't think Palm knows the magnitude of their quality problem because no one bothers to repair out of warranty items. I am never buying Palm again."
1,Quitting Palm,"Palm is such a great idea, but they make the on/off button too cheaply. It breaks on the day the warranty is done. This is my second breakage, and it shouldn't cost $200/quarter (90 day warranty) to store addresses and appointments."
3,Palm Tunsten E2,"I had a Palm III and loved it. This product is not that much better than the III.Good:1. Color screen is an improvement.2. More memory than the III.3. Battery life is fine: more than two weeks with low usage, and I can recharge it with my PC USB connection.4. The unit retains memory if the batteries go dead. This is nice.5. The bluetooth works well for backing up the data.Bad:1. The new Graffiti II is terrible, almost unusable. My mistake rate is about 25%; I liked the original Graffiti, and am very disappointed with the new version.2. I liked the old hard cover; the new flex cover is breaking already (<1 year old).3. The software for MP3 playback is terrible: very hard to upload, organize, or play songs; no documentation that I could easily find.4. Navigating around the operating system to do simple things is a little slow.Overall, I might buy one of these again, but I am a little disappointed. Eight years after my first Palm III, I expected a lot more from the Tungsten E2."
4,Great for what tis' designed to do,"This is a great device for what it's meant to do. It's designed to store and organize pieces of imformation, personal data, notes, etc. not function as a mini-laptop. For these purposes, it works great. The screen is large and clear, everything is easy to navigate and the battery life is incredible. The PIM functionality is good. Being able to attach notes to to-do list items that are then cross-referenced in the calendar is very useful for keeping things organized. The address book holds everything you'd ever want to know about a persn and then lets you add your own custom fields. Bluetooth is a nice feature and easy to configure, but not necessary for what the palm does, so I consider it an added bonus. This certainly isn't the be-all and end-all of mobile devices, but if you're looking for a well-designed tool to store and organize information that nees to be readily accessible, then the Tungsten E2 shoudl do the job jsut fine."
2,CD,This was sent quickly and was packaged safely and have been enjoying listening to it since. Thanks
2,Does not work any better than a cheap one,WMF Profi Plus 8-1/4-Inch Pizza CutterNot what one would expect for the price. Cutter is wobbly but very sharp. Very stylish - you can do just as well with a Target special. Made in China.
5,A good selection of themes.,"I don't know very much about the jazz, but I like the tracks (themes) listened with me. (Sorry, I don't speak english very good)"
5,works fine,"I use StarOffice every day without the slightest difficulty. Writer imports .doc files without any font problems (this is on Windows), Calc and Impress are fine as well. I'm very glad not to have to pay $500 - more than the price of a PC! - to Micro$oft.I have to wonder about the legitimacy some of the reviews below. For instance, all those who give StarOffice one star and compare it unfavorably to OpenOffice. StarOffice is *based* on OpenOffice ... the look and feel and functionality are *identical*; StarOffice is just enhanced to do a better job of reading MS Office files. Makes no sense at all to love OpenOffice and give StarOffice one star. Methinks Bill's droids are trying to game the system."
1,What's SUN trying to prove?,"I think $69 is even too much for a software that an undergratuate student can even put together for a project.Not intuitive or functional in any sense I would use either MS Office or WordPerfect Suite.Don't waste your money this software will be free soon.Another failed attempt @ Microsoft, way to go SUN :-)"
5,Greatly improved,"StarOffice 7's usability has been imroved significantly over the prior versions.As before, it runs on multiple platforms (which is essential for me).No more crashes (the application can run for several weeks without restarton my Solaris box).User interface is improved as well: faster and more intuitive.StarOffice has comes with same functionality as MS office (at a fraction of the cost)and there are no problems with MS office interoperability!!"
5,StarOffice Rocks!,"StarOffice 7 is just as good as Microsoft Office, for a fraction of the cost. I am well pleased with the product."
3,Not bad,"For the amount you pay, and the fact that most users only use maybe 20% of the features of Micro$oft$ Office, this office suite could be just what people have been waiting for."
2,It's a lot like Microsoft Office was in 1994,"StarOffice 7 is a good basic package that has some neat twists to it. The files products are actually XML and the sxw file format is a an archive file that's compatible with the ZIP utilities.On the whole, it works well. There can be some oddities though when you save files as Microsoft Office documents. I've had a number of people find the files get ... a bit rearranged when opened in different versions of Office.The interface is a bit nicer than with OpenOffice, but OpenOffice 1.1 seems more stable on my various Linux systems.(...)"
1,Java is full of bugs,"This needs java to run and it is the worst plug-in you can put on your PC. It causes run-time script errors and helps you download viruses on you computer. The Open office is worse than this, if you use either versions of these Office suites your computer will crash and never work right again. I am happy I have a backup, because I had to ghost my computer after this StarOffice install.Now after installing MS Office 2003, I am not pleased with myself wasting money on StarOffice."
1,Bad software,"This product failed to convert files correctly, thus causing data to be lost.Stay away, just buy the norm MS Office."
1,The low-down,"First off, this has to be the worst Office suite I have ever purchased. It does not convert files correctly, or if it does it must be in a foreign language or something. There is NO email application? What the heck do use for email, well I guess there is no market for email any longer..... Anyways, I find that the icons in the applications are hard to read, something to do with Java. Just do yourself a favor and just use MS Office it works!"
1,Is zero stars possible,"Absolutely the worst Office Suite I have ever used and purchased. If you want to be aggravated by non-working applications, errors coverting MS Office Docs, Excel spread-sheets and database-java script errors then this is for you.For the rest of the user community use MS Office 2003, I purchased this and I am never considering anyother alternative."
1,Does not work without Java installed,"This requires the Java plug-in from Sun.com and itcauses errors, plus the download is huge in size.If you want a REAL Office Suite look no furtherthan Microsoft Office 2003-it is the BEST."
3,MS office compatibility isn't perfect,"I have heard that equations entered in the writing program do not transfer to MS word. When opening in MS word, the equations are simple missing. Also, complicated formulas in the spreadsheet software do not translate well. Saving a MS excel program in the staroffice format can mess up the formulas. Also, graphs set on a separate sheet do not show up nicely on Staroffice. Just some considerations. Otherwise it seems to work well. If you need to go from MS office to Staroffice regularly, it might be better to stick with MS office."
2,Don't get it if you want it all / if you care for compatib.,"The product is fine for people who don't really need all the sophisticated features of MSOffice.I tried to use it as an alternative for Excel and Powerpoint, but there were big! problems with compatibility when I tried to exchange files with my colleagues and friends. Only the most plain Excel sheets and presentations can be exchanged without losing some style information or document intelligence.MS Word files can be handled quite well, but there will be always something missing, esp if you make use of some specific features (e.g. automatic inclusion of chapter caption in the header, macros, .. there is a lot of that). And very very often there will be some objects that lost their right position.The product is o.k., esp. considering the price. But don't get it, if you want it / need it all!"
1,Going Back to OpenOffice,"Glad I did not pay for this. I like OpenOffice functionality better, plus it is free. I like OO as a replacement MSOffice where my clients can't/won't get MS licenses."
4,Better and faster than MS Office,"I have been using Star Office and Open Office suites for a while (since 5.1) and the improvment of product quality has been great. I use it all time interchageably with others using MS office and other office programs. Now both Star Office or Open Office is in the mainstream and I am in the process of eliminating all MS office software from my systems. MS's has a vision where they are going to try control how you think and their office software show this by all the auto-formatting is does while writing. If you are not sure if you would like it, try openoffice.org first. Star Office is a much more polished version of Open Office with extra bells and whistles. I give it 5 stars in all areas except price and that is why it is only 4 out 5 stars."
1,Not worth a star ***,"First off you need to install Sun's Java, on a dial upconnection the download is huge and would take hours toinstall it. This is required and once installed it takesover the machine generating Java exception errors.Second, it does NOT convert Excel spreadsheets correctlyleaving ### (hash marks) in the cells.Third, I cannot think of anything this can do other thanconsume tons of memory and generate java errors."
1,Better stuff for free,"I left the Microsoft Office monopoly a while back. And let me say there is better stuff than Star Office out there for free. Programs like Open Office can do word processing, spreadsheets, web pages, and power-point like projects and have updates, unlike Star Office. Do yourself a favor and don't touch this cheap clone."
1,Nothing but problems,"Anyone who writes reviews on StarOffice as excellent have not used this 'office_suite'. For starters when converting files from MS Excel it converts some columns to '#' signs. This is a great concern because this was my billing cycle that was messed up because of this. Next the whole deal with SLOW loading, plus it gets some java run-time errors. Then I started getting java script errors, to say the least it messed up my workstations and I had to re-load the operating system on another.If you want files that are incomplete, data that is missing, or overall total file destruction this is for you."
4,What a great deal! (Students/Educators: plz read!),"Much better value than other bloated productivity suites by by the leading monopolies. True, it doesn't convert everything perfectly, but such is life -- in most cases all you need is a few minutes to adjust the settings to however you see fit. Bravo to Amazon.com for a great deal on this software!(For individual students and educators with broadband: Browse Sun's website for StarOffice 7.)"
3,Careful when reading the reviews on this product....,"Disclaimer: I don't own this product. I gave it an average rating because of this.Having read all of the reviews on this product, I've noticed that on the negative reviews there are consistencies in grammar that are hard to explain if they were written by different people. Check for yourself against this phrase:""...Java which is slow and buggy...""Leads me to believe that MS employees are posting reviews of a competitors product."
1,country music fan no fan of this,The quality of these recordings is terrible! It does not do justice to George Jones. Find his songs on other CD's!
4,Italian watch,Purchased to replace a watch originally purchased in Capri and which was stolen. Looks very much the same and was sent promptly. Haven't worn it yet. Thank you for prompt action.
5,For Hardcore Film Lovers Only,"A teenage boy made a video of a pig being slaughtered when his parents visited a farm. He also stole the gunlike instrument used in the process. With parents away for the weekend, the boy invites a lonely teenage girl he met at a video store to his apartment, where he kills her. We get little insight as to why - however his extremely cold & distant father and TV clips of the war in Bosnia link this boy's deficient emotional state to the human condition. Despite an unpalatable premise, the film moves masterfully through to a strong conclusion."
4,No Funny Games this time,"Austrian director Michael Haneke is adept at puncturing your mind, challenging your power of judgement, and then lingering deep in your memory. He directed this five years before the masterpiece Funny Games, and this is no less gripping of a tale.Benny is a young teen whose obsession with violent films spills over into real life. The dilemma he ensnares his family in is quite disturbing. I love how Haneke defies many standard methods of storytelling, much of the violence occurs just off screen.If you liked Funny Games, give this a look. There is not much humor here, the tone is dark, edgy, and desperate. Haneke is brilliant at pacing and sustaining momentum. 4.5 stars"
2,fails,"Header says it: fails on two levels: not only as a horror flick, but as an intellectual take on why humanshave this urge/need/desire/propensity to murder for (apparently) no reason at all.Could the answer (simply) be ""boredom?"" About the only character (the young killer's mother) who comes alive (if briefly) is when she takes her son to Egypt--in order to get away from some nasty bit of businessthat the kid committed back in Europe and sobs for a while, guilt having gotten to her after all (for having attempted, along with her husband, to cover up their dull little punk's dirty deed.)By the way, don't be fooled. This can't, CAN'T touch the original Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, a true horror classic."
4,An imaginative concept...,"The premise sounds great - a story about a librarian who falls in love with a giant teenager. I began reading with a smile, anticipating all sorts of strange and wonderful situations. Although the story was sweetly memorable, I thought the author missed an opportunity to inject some humor into the tale. Surely this situation would have some funny moments as well as so many serious ones.Overall, I would recommend this book because of its fantastic premise alone. I am curious to see what Ms. McCracken comes up with next"
2,Disappointing Read,"I found myself feeling actual hostility toward Peggy as I read this book. Her motives were foreign to me; her actions often unfathomable. This is not a plot-centered book, but that is not its chief fault. There are plenty of highly successful books that are less story-line than they are explorations of character. What makes this particular book excruciating is that one cares not a bit for its flat and unbelievable protagonist. We read this book in my book club, and I believe my views were representative."
3,"Okay, though not all it's been cracked up to be","Although I thought the premise of the novel--a small town librarian falling in love with a giant teenager--was really fascinating, I found myself feeling empty at the end of the book. Peggy Court felt very flat to me as a character, and we hardly got to know James at all. The ending was highly unsatisfactory. Dotty should never have been. An interesting read, but not something I would enthusiastically recommend."
3,"Interesting, but the ending seems rushed, disjointed","The premise seems interesting, and the portrait of Peggy is an unusual and touching one, but the love story is difficult to invest in, become involved in. James is not a well-developed character, so the reader's understanding of the love between them is one-sided. In addition, the ending seems rushed, out of character, and not quite believable. It left me feeling like the story deserved better than that ending."
3,Nice but flawed novel of unlikely romance.,"Despite an interesting premise, this book disappoints because of the ending. I was entranced with James, but Peggy - in having a child- is totally out of character- both for the time she is in (the 1950's) and the pattern of her life up to that point."
3,Disappointing,"Like most National Book Award nominees, this novel doesn't live up to the hype. Awkwardly written, it's about the relationship between an extremely tall young man named James, and Peggy, a librarian about 12 years older than him. It's barely interesting enough to hold your interest to the end. There is also a glaring discrepancy in the final pages that is impossible to ignore or accept. Hint: do the math, two months should be obvious. One wishes that a more talented writer had taken the basic story outline and run with it--the result would undoubtedly have been better."
2,Disappointing; inferior to its real-life model.,"McCracken bases her giant upon real-life giant Robert Wadlow (RIP 1940), a familiar face in Guinness Books of World Records. Wadlow, who floundered throughout his life seeking a career that would preserve his dignity, was a lot more interesting than her character; not that McCracken's giant is as much a factor in this book as the muted, whiny, navel-contemplating -- in other words, standard dirty-realist --pack of lame supporting characters. McCracken should punt."
3,Not bad...,"The Giant's House is a good story, well written, a bit slow in parts but ultimately worth the time spent. The ending seems a little rushed, and I wish Peggy had told James she loved him, but I believe the charcters are written well and developed ok throughout the story."
1,Unsettling,"I am not a fan of books written in the first person, but the person who lent it to me had nothing but rave reviews! The book to say the least was unsettling and quite disturbing. I found the story line long, drawn and boring. The characters lacking depth and emotion. The only character you feel sorry for is Mrs. Sweatt, who is honest and outright from the start, she hides nothing. As for Peggy, she comes across as pitiful, selfish and ""stalker-like"" in her obsession with James.I know evey book does not have a happy ending and I have read those, but I was relieved when I could put this book back on the shelf and forget the characters in it!"
2,Giant Miss,"The only reason it didn't take me long to read this book is because I kept waiting for the story to get better...And waiting. But it never did. The author wrote about how Peggy spent the day with James so many times that it just got boring. I woulnd't recommend this book, I felt it was a giant disappointment. The ending made it even worse."
4,A most unusual romance,"Elizabeth McCracken's 1996 novel The Giant's House recalls a most unusual romance. Peggy Cort is the librarian in a small Cape Cod village. James Carlson is an ""over-tall"" eleven year old boy who becomes a patron of the library, then later Cort's closest companion. Carlson is, literally, a ""freak"" of nature. As he grows to his late teens, he becomes over eight feet tall. He is also quite frail, and destined to live a short life. The ""romance"" between Cort and Carlson both is and is not platonic. Peggy's daughter both is and is not James' posthumous son. This is a very moving work, and says much about small town life and prejudices, friendships, and love -- whatever that is. It is a very quiet book, and perhaps quietness -- or repression -- is a main theme. McCracken writes beautifully, and both her plot and characters (including the impossibly tall James) ring true and clear."
4,Wow,"I really enjoyed this book. The whole premise is very creative - a 1950s relationship between a librarian and a student, 13 years her junior. People just don't write about stuff like that. :-) In the end, you realize how much the librarian changed, but didn't change at the same time. One bright light shown in her life for the decade, and her life was forever altered, but then she went back to being the same ole recluse she was before the giant came into her life. I wish things had turned out differently for our romantic pair, but..."
2,Good Pictures - Very Short Battery Life,"This camera's 3x optical zoom worked well and it took good pictures inside and outdoors however they did not appear to be any sharper than the pictures I got with a $98 3MP Vivitar.The Vivitar did not have 3x optical zoom or macro capability which is a definite plus on the Samsung 420.On the more negative side for the Samsung, and the main reason for just two stars; a new set of alkaline batteries lasted less than one day, taking only about six pictures. That was with trying to minimize my use of the LCD display to conserve batteries."
2,"Not what I would call ""point and shoot""","I've had this camera for nearly two years and have read the manual from front to back several times and still can't get the camera to take a decent picture. My first digital was a Sony MVCFD200 FD Mavica 2MP Digital Still Camera, and it took WONDERFUL pictures, but let my ex-hubby keep it. I'm sorry I didn't stick with what worked, and bought another Sony Mavica.Like the other reviews, I, too, learned to turn off the flash and yes, it did improve the photo quality, but nothing compared to the Sony."
3,Unique book,The most appealing thing about this book is the journey Mark made - I have always wondered what it would be like to circumnavigate Australia. I also felt I learned alot about Australia from his description of the different regions. The journey itself was fine but not a life or death adventure. It's a good story.
2,A disappointment!,"I wish I could give a better rating. This is by far one of the worst thrillers I have ever read. The story is predictable, plot too simple, characters too powerful. Imagine resuing someone of the huge jungle of Cuba. It took only a chat and a map to locate the hostages.This is my first Hailey book and probably my last.Perhaps Hailey is overrated."
2,Predictable,"Well if you like Sidney Sheldon, you might be in the range of just liking it-but with a difference. You know what to expect when you pick up Sidney Sheldon - there's an entertainment value at the least. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. The book is highly predictable, when author first tells you story and then what follows is an investigation of what has already been told to you. You can't put the book down - simply because you won't like taking it up. This was my first Arthur Hailey book and boy, I swear this will be my last. Its bad to judge author from one book, but impressions lasts longer especially when you feel you wasted your time by reading a book that claims to be a best seller"
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This book kept me up till 7am and I completed the first 2/3 of it in one go (Then I had to get some sleep..). It describes the TV news networks very well, down to the detail of how the technical side works, and at the same time the story keeps you spellbound till the last word.It is the first book I have read by Arthur Hailey, but it sure won't be the last!"
2,"Formulaic, predictable, and highly inaccurate.","This one is very likely Hailey's worst book. In fact, in my opinion, it stank. The plot is formulaic, and Hailey, as he has tended to do over the past 20 years, mistakes overpessimism for profundity. But I digress.In ""The Evening News"" we are supposed to believe that the electronic news media functions as a form of superagency that can and does outperform the FBI and CIA while simultaneously acting at a level above that of the government. What nonsense. The whole plot is permeated with this tripe.I will give Hailey credit for keeping the book moving. Although this book had little to say, it at least says it at a brisk pace that makes for a quick, if unsatisfying, read.A mediocre book from a writer capable of much better."
2,Hailey's Weakest Book,"I read this book looking forward to an insightful view of an industry - the in the tradition of Airport, Hotel, Moneychangers, and many more. What I read was Hailey's weakest book. While his statement and theme of an independent press is good, the story cracks in many places. If Hailey can't do better than this, he should fish in Bermuda and retire from writing."
3,From 5 stars to 3,"The first three quarters of the book are very good, they will keep you reading all the time, but the last quarter when Harry decides that he is better than SWAT is really pathetic, if you read this book, don't get disappointed with that pathetic end."
2,Not useful for DSLR?,It is only for small DC but cannot support my D70 with 18-70 lens. The legs are soft and too flexible.
2,Pretty lame tripod,"I was under the impression this was similar to a GorillaPod, and it is not even close. It is very small and light, which is nice, but it is SO small and SO unflexible that it is practically worthless.Save your money and put it towards a GorillaPod. I bought one after being VERY disappointed by this, and I couldn't be happier with it."
4,Great item!,"Tested thing bad boy out today and i'd have to say, its quite small, kinda hard to maneuver, but it gets the job done. Another downside was a bunch of black thread looking plastic stuff rubs off of it. But otherwise Great for the price!"
3,Doesn't work for My Camera,"Doesn't work simply because the screw in spot is not centered, and therefore the camera tips over. If my camera had a centered screw in spot this product would be nice to have."
4,Inexpensive Steady Tripod,"Obviously, this isn't going to be as good as a Gorilla-pod or a full size tripod, but it is excellent for capturing clear pictures. I use this with our Kodak Zi8 for taking videos and our camera for capturing pictures in low-light settings. Overall, I would rate this product 4/5. It doesn't really wrap around anything, but it is adjustable so that you get a good angle to your shots."
3,Not so flexible,"Works for simple leveling, and to avoid using the grass, etc.But if you need to attach the camera to something, or maybe a greater angle, you will need another product."
4,Fun product,This tripod is so easy to use. I bought one for myself as well as my sister and father. It might not be the best tripod for serious photographers but for those of us who just like to take pictures it's perfect.
4,Does the job!,"I use this on my canon a720IS to take night shots or set custom timer to sneak myself in the picture with other members of the family. I also hold it and take shots as it acts as a stabilizer giving more focused picture. Cheap, portable, and works with point and shoot cameras. I wouldn't trust a DSLR on it since toppling over will easily cost you $500 or more."
3,"Cheap, but that's what you expect...","If you're buying this tripod, you're obviously looking for a deal, so I'll rate this based on that premise...-Pro: Easy to stand up, holds the flip and most small point and shoots perfectly fine, easy to travel with in pocket or bag, and costs less than the Flip brand.-Con: Super cheaply made, the clip snapped off with a little tug (not a huge loss, not sure what I'd clip it onto anyway), can be hard to position on a slippery surface, legs don't wrap around poles or railings that securely.There ya go, if any of the cons scare you off just spend the extra $5 for the flip brand, it's a bit more stable and not so cheaply made."
3,"nice, could be better","It is nice little tripod. Very small and compact. It stands fairly well on its own. It grips some things but not a whole lot. It doesn't always hold its position when I set it up on an uneven surface, but it does work for some things. Overall, not great, but good."
3,"cheap, smells bad, but works","I bought several of these because they were so cheap, and they turned out to be pretty close to one I paid a good $15 for over 10 years ago. They are generically packaged and reek of the chemicals from the factory (I feel bad for the Chinese workers who had to breathe the air there) but after a few days sitting outside they were tolerable. Well worth the price unless you consider the ridiculous shipping charge of the seller."
4,It was cheap and works,"Got this for a digital camera, the camera tripod mount was off center, but with careful bending was able to get it stable. Would not buy for an expensive shoot, but for quick pics on the point and shoot its fine."
3,Vanguard VS41 Flexible Mini tripod,"Item is a little smaller than expected. Unfortunately not very stable, but worth the price.I suppose I have to just get used to setting it up properly."
2,Not that useful to me.,"I wanted a very small tripod to carry with me when I bike ride. This tripod is suitable for a small digital camera. It is not suited to a small palmcorder or larger camcorder. It may hold it but you will have to balance things carefully. It will be even more difficult on uneven surfaces. The flexible legs are not flexible in the ways I would like. They cannot be contorted into positions that would allow versatile settings. Their useful range of flex is rather limited. I bought a folding, rigid leg mini tripod from vivitar for about the same price. It is much more flexible in terms of supporting the camera in odd positions on odd surfaces like a fence post where the post is not level. I wouldn't recommend this tripod for the reasons mentioned, plus it is no smaller than the vivitar, and won't support as much weight. The normal rigid leg tripod is also way more stable and not so likely to collapse or fall over with the camera."
3,"Unsteady, but handy","I needed a particularly short camera stand with some flexibility of angle, and this looked like a good bet. While it is handy for steadying my camera, it takes a lot of fiddling with to make the tripod itself stable in whatever configuration you want. This also makes it time-consuming and difficult to change angles or height. If you have one persistent configuration you want to use it in, it's probably perfect, particularly given the fantastic price. But make sure you understand its limitations."
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought this a while back for my Flip Cam. After using it for less than 30 mins, one of the leg's wires locked up/broke. As a tripod, it still works, but isn't nearly as pose-able as it should be anymore. I should've just paid the 10-20 bucks for a legitimate tripod and I'd be a lot more stoked. Had the leg not broken, I'd be pretty into it for the money. Alas, not as good as it could be."
5,"Great, unbelievable and cheap","I initially bought this because it was cheap. But after using the product now I feel, its great. I love it. Its dead cheap and works great. I like the flexible legs. I use it so often. I recommend it to everyone."
2,Ok recommend vs55,I purchased the vs41 and vs55. Vs41 more flexable but vs55 stays firm on any surface. I've Used the Vs41 a few times and it does what its suppose to do but if you use a heavy lense the VS55 will do a job better.
2,unnecessary,"Works just fine, especially for a mere few bucks-- but you end up using the table or a book just as easily, and a cheapo little bean bag would be more ideal anyway."
1,Emits Toxic like Smells when opened,When I opened the box on this product I was struck with a nauseating toxic like smell (kind of like a cross between burning plastic and oil). After a day the smell had largely abated but it still has that smell if you put it to the nostrils. I recall reading something like this about this product or something similar. Mfg should recall the product until it deals with the potentially dangerous vapor issue.
1,cheap junk,"Don't waste your time - get one a little less cheap. There is a reason that S&H; is more than product price (and way more than is reasonable: 2oz @1st class is $0.79).This is the same exact product as ""Sunpak 620-786 Mini-Spider Tripod""They don't support my tiny Lumix FX33 and are more elastic than ""poseable""."
4,Can't beat the price!,"Used with a mid-size Powershot it is sturdy enough, will be great with any smaller point-and-shoot.There's been a lot of buzz about the heavier gorrilla-size minipods, and I'm sure they're more reliable but they're also 10x the price, so if you're just casually using it, or only need it for indoor tabletop snaps, it's clearly a very good deal"
5,Tripod/Hand Grip,"This is a very nice little tripod, which also doubles as an excellent hand-grip for those of us with large hands. No more worries of holding a small digital camera and having fingers getting in the way of the lens. Set-up as a flex-tripod is easy, but be careful with large cameras, as they will tip over easily. All in all, this was a great buy for me. It definitely deserves 5 stars. By all means, buy it, you won't be sorry!"
4,Works OK,"A rigid tripod is better for situations where it can sit up straight, but if you need to bend or twist to an odd angle then this semi-flexible one is fine."
3,not so good,I found this to be a little fragile. Your camera has to be a light one. Because of the flexible legs one has to be careful to set the camera straight to keep the picture straight! Be careful before you buy.
4,Perfect for tabletop,"I wasn't sure what to expect for this price, but it's a sturdy enough little tripod to hold my Sony DSC-H1 Cybershot with an additional filter and sunshade extension installed on the lense, all weighing maybe a little over 2 lbs. max. The tripod just screws on to the bottom of the camera, which is in the middle of my camera, so it isn't an issue as it might if the place to attach the tripod were off-center. I'd buy this unit again. I did purchase a lightweight travel tripod as well, but this is just right for tabletop uses."
3,Worth the price,No doubt this product is worth the price. It's also very easy to transport. It fits into my jacket picket easily. The mini-tripod holds my digital camera without a problem.The legs are a bit stiff making it a little hard to adjust at times. Forget wrapping the legs around a vertical pole. The head doesn't swivel making panoramic shots difficult at best.
3,so so product,"It works out OK, honestly, just below my expectation. Two legs are flexible enough but the last one is so stiff and hard to bend. It's cheap though."
4,...be careful during windy conditions...!,"Good price and easy to keep packed in my backpack ready for use. Be sure to spread the ""feet"" as wide as possible during windy conditions or your camera will take a tumble!"
5,Best for Price,I have had this camera for a while now.For the price and features that come with it you will not find a better deal.It is great and I would recommend to everyone.
3,Not too great in high heat,"I took this to Iraq with me and it was an okay camera for a while. Then the weather got really hot, it'd take a few pictures, then freeze up due to the heat. So for anything else, you're okay, I guess."
3,Good review but outdated,"I bought the book as a text for a test review class. The book was useful, particularly the review exams. You will need your old electronics textbooks (AC/DC and Electronic Devices) for the equations and example problems. My exam was full of tube questions and outdated testing procedures (Lisajous Patterns). However, if you understand the ""ancient"", you understand the development of IC's."
4,Great Practical Review,"It's been a little while since my electronics schooling has finished, and needed to brush up on my knowledge, as well as start studying toward ISCET certification. The practice test are a great learning tool, although there are a few instances throughout the book of typos and confusing wording. With a little thought they can be sorted out. All around, very useful."
1,Ambiguous and Rife with Errors,The number of errors and ambiguities in this book are astounding. I agree with the previous reviewer that you are better off studying elementary electronics text books.
5,"Wreck and sinking of the Titanic,:The ocean's greatest disaster",Purchased for a student who has a great intrest in the Titanic and the facts surrounding it. He has really enjoyed it. Purchase was easy and gave student a greater knowlege. What more could I ask for ... I have a life long learning with in my classes.
5,Works Great For Cairn Terriers!,"The metal teeth are excellent in getting through our Cairn Terrier's hair. The light color allows you to really see what you get off your pet. The small size is good for getting every spot on these small sized dogs and it is comfortable to hold onto. This replaces an all plastic flea comb, which did not work at all. I am quite happy with my purchase."
3,Pretty Chill,"I'd give it 2.5 stars. It's a good recording with a clean, polished sound. I disagree with ""a music fan"" from VA -- this CD doesn't rock. It's like a chill, relaxing, reggae lounge sound, with light jazzy sounding keyboards and effects in many songs. I like my reggae a little more raw and less processed or sterilized. I'd probably prefer one of thier live CDs over this one. To me, Jah Works sounds like UB40 if they were more influenced by current dancehall reggae. Sometimes they put too much emphasis on the singing, and not enough jamming. At times, it sounds like a rapping contest between the two singers, each one trying to out-do the the other, and sound more Jamaican. If you want a more authentic modern roots sound, give a listen to John Brown's Body. They're way better than Jah Works."
4,My third Berger and Des book and it keeps the string of hits coming.,I like the characters and the story lines of this series. I woulld recommend it for anyone interested in mysteries with personable and likable main characters.
4,Wonderful fragrance!,"I became aware of this beautiful fragrance many years ago and I look for it all of the time. I was amazed to find it through Amazon.You normally will not find this lovely fragrance in a mall department store. It is difficult to describe the fragrance, but I consider it my most special of the several that I own. It is not heavy nor is it too sweet. It is not overpowering, but people do notice it with a great comment."
2,Wrong cologne,"I ordered the wrong Alexandra de Markoff cologne for my mother's birthday. I should have ordered Enigma instead. Unfortunately, I found out too late that cologne cannot be returned/exchanged because it is considered a hazardous material. I don't understand why it wasn't considered hazardous when it was shipped to me. Needless to say, the box sits unopened in it's original shipping box."
5,A well-written introductory text,"This interesting introduction to water technology is suitable for self-study, for use as a text, or for reference. It has an international flavor (EU/US), and its references reflect a good balance between North America and Europe. It provides clear, concise, and accurate explanations, and is broad in its coverage. U.S. college/university audiences will find it a viable alternative to standard textbooks."
3,"an excellent film, poor print. wait until late 2004 to buy","This review is for the Criterion Collection (1st edition) of the film.This movie is Fritz Lang's first ""talkie"" and an excellent film about a serial child murderer. The police are so obsessed with catching him and are everywhere. This prevents the other criminals like pickpocketers and burgalrs from doing their criminal activity so they team up and enlist the help of beggars and the ""underworld"" to find and apprehend the murderer.This Criterion DVD, now temoraraily out of print, has bad picture quality but still is a good film.Later this year the DVD will be rereleased with far better picture quality and special features which this version does not have. This edition has no special features of any kind. I will put up a new review when the new version is released."
4,hard to believe this film was made 77 years ago,"Perhaps the very first serial killer film ever made--way back in l931!Although, as far as directors go, I preffer the works of Claude Chabrol (especially Chabrol's The Butcher, over Lang's M), Lang's M holds up pretty damn well.What you really get here is three films in one: first third feels like a serial killer film, middle third feels like a police procedural, and the last third feels like a crime caper flick.For me, the first and last third worked exceptionally well. Peter Lorre convincing in the title role. Middle part (with the cops doing what cops do) lagged and felt drawn out, only because we have seen so many scenes like this over the years in other films of this nature.Friedkin interviews Lang in the two-disk package."
4,First Noir,"This was basically a superior movie, still daring in its subject matter and approach going on 70 years later. There are parts in the middle that are just a bit too wordy, however. Sorry, I wasn't looking for a car chase, but I do feel there's a bit of drag about 2/3 of the way through. The movie as a whole more than makes up for it. Was that the worst I could say? Definitely deserves its place in the noir pantheon."
2,Wonderful Movie _ A Criterion Transfer Failure!,"I have seen this movie once on a german video-edition and there was no annoying thick white line in the upper part of the picture for nearly 2/3 of the movie, which distracts you a lot while viewing. I don't know what happened thtrough Criterion Collection's transfer work, but something must have gone wrong.As I know and appreciate their craftsmanship, proven with the restauration of films like ""The Third Man"" and ""The Seven Samurai"" (to name a few) wich is perfect through out. So my amazement when I bought this DVD was to the negativ, since I expected a miracle work again.My advice: Don't buy this DVD-Edition now. Wait for a new edition to come out, since Criterion is able to do a better work. I hope they will."
1,"five star film but horrible print quality,",...A wonderful and thought provoking film but what was Criterion doing by releasing this print? The last third of of the film was ruined by a white line across the top of the TV destroying the mood of the film and making it practically unwatchable. Buy at your own risk. At Criterion's high prices print quality should be outstanding.
5,"M, an awesome DVD at last.","M is a wonderful piece of early sound cinema. It is Peter Lorre's first film and he portrays a chilling yet pathetic man who commits such heinous crimes. It is beautifully made by director Fritz Lang. Both Lorre and Lang would go on to make their mark in Hollywood film history.The film is beautifully restored. After years of poor quality VHS releases, I found this DVd to be of very high quality. It is nice to finally see this film intact and the interview with Fritz Lang is a treat. This is a must for collectors of classic cinema."
4,Peter Lorre is frightening.,"In this, his first famous role, Peter Lorre is frightening at the same time pitiable, as a suspected child murderer. Given his dimunitive size it is odd to watch him entice his next victim, hardly smaller than himself. He is disgusted with his own desire, frightened of the pursut that builds during the film, twisting and slimey, like some newt or toad, trying to escape. The story has several clever plot twists, such as having the underworld capture him, but it is Lorre's face,posture, acting that carry this movie. Well worth seeing!"
5,Film Noir before it existed.,"Peter Lorre was honing his craft before he came to the U.S. and this is probably his best film performance, ever!"
