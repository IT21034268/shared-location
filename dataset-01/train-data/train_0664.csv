4,Remanufactured Brother EMFC-8220 Laser Multifunction Center,Black and White laser printer does great job of printing. Everything works. 250 sheet paper tray. Normal text prints at about 18-20 pages a minute. Intricate print is about 7-10 pages a minute. Would buy again. Paid less than $200.00.
2,Ho-Hum,"I should have heeded the words of another reviewer, who felt this album was basically a modern soft jazz version of Hawaiian music. I thought - I like jazz, I like island music - maybe this will be cool. Wrong-o. This album is pretty much muzak - homogenized and shined up to have mass appeal, I suppose. It misses the mark, though, and hits neither a truly jazz oriented stride nor the island feel one might anticipate. Mr. Shimabukuro is obviously talented, but those talents go to waste on a go-nowhere album. If you are looking for HAWAIIAN music, and want to feel that flavor once you're back home and missing those lovely islands, pick up Keali'i Reichel's 2-disc set, ""Kamahiwa"" and get ready to feel some true yearning. His voice is silky, and the melodies are lovely - nothing kitchy or contrived here. This is beautiful, soul-stirring stuff. So, pass on Jake, and seek out Keali'i."
5,This Rocks,This band is renowned for good quality bsides and this collection of songs make a better album than the Platinum selling Out Of Nothing and any of the other albums that went before it.
1,Fish-eye lens,"I had known that these attachments had a soft focus around the edges, but this was terrible. I was hoping that I could crop off the sides(with soft focus) and still get a wider view than my normal lens offers.Nope.By the time you get to the point where the edges aren't sharp, you have less angle of view than a wide angle lens.If you want this for goofy effects, great. If you want any kind of sharpness, forget it."
4,Great for the price,"This adapter is a lot of fun. it's certainly not a real fish eye lens, but for the price it's great. If you want high quality optics, buy a real lens. This is full of colour aberrations around the edges, but for fun it's hard to beat the price."
2,Eh,"This book was about a girl named Hilliry. She is 12 or 13 and she BELIVES that everything else is not real. Come on, I am 12 and I never belived that! This book was really confusing and boring, my favorite part was the end."
3,the ashwater experiment,the book the ashwater experiment was about a girl who movd around all of the time . but for six mounthes she staedin in one spot. the things i liked aboutthe book was it had a lot of detail . the things i didnt like about the book was i just did not intrest me.my favorite chacter was hillery becuase she was interesting.in concltion i think the book was ok but all depens on what your looking for in a book.
1,Caution on this product,"I didn't use specifically this product. I bought some heavy duty plastic ties for our tennis screens and between the wind load and the UV deterioration they broke within 2 months. I didn't see any UV note on this product, so would be wary, at least in a wind environment (ours is Northern Virginia in an open field)."
5,The grandmother of protest singers,"Violetta Parra was singing for her people, for her beliefs and for her political standing a decade before Bob Dylan.Her songs range from the fight for freedom of opinion and speech (La Carta) to her personal life (Gracias a la Vida), always sung in a way that reaches out form her heart to the hearts of her listeners.She belongs in the hall of fame of artists who were never afraid to stand and voice what they believe in, fight for it, when needed, and even pay the personal price that goes with these.This CD is a magnificent example of Violetta's enchanting work."
4,A music fan from Sweden,"Well, what can I say. Actually i'm out of words, because this soundtrack score is brilliant. Trevor Jones has made a exellent work, It must be his all time great score. That's at least what I think. As I said, i'm lost for words. The opening track gives pretty much a tale about what the whole album are about to give you. So, this is the score I haft to say is one of the best i've heard in my entire life !!!!!!!!!"
2,Meh....,"If you compare this with the composer's earlier effort, 'The Dark Crystal'...you would probably think it was composed by two different people.As I was listening to this soundtrack--not ever had seen the film the music was compsed for--I thought this music could have been for any movie or televised film or series that dealt with politics; the music has a U.S. 'patriotic' at certain points.However, the music wasn't inspiring, and didn't move me in any way.There was a certain motif in the theme, but it came off as soft.James Horner, in certain themes, puts his heart and soul to the point where, as a listener, you start to 'feel' the music whether or not you've seen the film the music was for. Examples: 'Legends of the Fall'...'Glory'...'Iris'...'Thirteen Days' was an un-memorable soundtrack for me; it was un-inspiring."
3,A LIttle Boring after a while,"Some of the songs hold a lot of beautiful melodies and it is a marvelous score. However, sometimes the songs are too drawn out and it gets a little tired - just though I'd warn you."
5,Brilliant work from a talented group of artists.,My husband and I saw Peplowski live with Howard Aulden and were ... transformed. This man is gifted and his personality shines on every track. I highly recommend this artist.
4,great thom yorke cd,eraser is a very nice and refreshing album from the former singer of the great Radiohead.Buy this with PABLO HONEY and THE BENDS from RADIOHEAD but avoid all albums from the horrendous Justin Stinkerlake as suggested by a previous reviewer.thanks
3,Thom Yorke is Thom Yorke not Radiohead.,"I have listened to this album several times now and I have grown to appreciate it, but I really doubt that I will ever ""love"" it. I would still recommend it, since it is worth checking out."
5,"Hands down, Best Album of 2006 so far","Thom Yorke just seems to pour his whole mind and soul into every album he records, and ""The Eraser"" is not exception to this. From the opening track, all the way through it, Yorke's music in it shines with brilliance and echoes of minimalist electronica. Co-produced by Radiohead's longtime collaborator Nigel Godrich and with the bare minimum instrumentation necessary to help his voice tell his stories throughout the album's nine songs, the album's highest point is reached in ""Harrowdown Hill"", the best song in it. With ""The Eraser"", hands down, Thom Yorke takes home the Best of 2006 award so far."
4,a worthwhile detour,"This is definitely not a Radiohead LP. It's almost a Trent Reznor (not NIN) LP, but Yorke expresses his angst more introspectively, with juxtapositions of eerie melodies and vocals on very pretty and ethereal backdrops, whereas Reznor tends toward aggressive backdrops with simple melodies.Unlike the style he's adopted on Radiohead releases, here Yorke's vocals and melodies are much more understandable and hummable. It's a very personal, very minimal set of actual *songs*. Fairly straightforward structure, and lots of melody. But don't let the sparse structure fool you. Rather than coming off like a demo in need of ornament, things sound abstracted and distilled to essential elements and nothing more.In addition to Reznor I can hear Rufus Wainwright, Prince, and Flock of Seagulls. I really, really like this record -- I only hope it doesn't mean there's less Radiohead coming."
1,Don't buy it just because the package design is very poor,"Other people can review the music, I'm reviewing the packaging. It isn't a jewel box or a digi pak. Its a folding set of flaps of paper with a cd loosely put in it. It will get damaged being handled and damaged if you pull it in and out of wherever you keep your cds a lot.I support the jewel box, they last forever, the plastic protects the booklet and art. For those who say plastic is non environmental, These will fall apart and end up in the trash (so you have to buy a new one) at least a jewel box will last."
1,I thought this album was a joke . . .,"Really, I did. I can't claim to be a huge Radiohead fan, but I have enjoyed their music in the past so a took a flyer on this highly rated album. Before you buy this, listen to a clip of The Eraser. Multiply that annoying, painful 30 seconds times 80 and you would be better off than buying the 40 minutes of complete and utter trash that is this album. I have no idea what anyone else is listening to when they give this album high marks."
1,pin girl says it all,"read pin girl's review. hit it on the head there pin girl! if there's anything more annoying than whining, thom does it here!"
3,"Neither young, gifted or black","Most people know Thom Yorke as 'that guy who used to sing in Iron Maiden', but he's much more than that.We'll never know the full reason for his dismissal; whether the sex act involved three or four giraffes is a fact lost in the sombre fog of history. Some even suggest he had an affair with Radiohead's drummer, Mariah Carey.All we know for sure is that this time last month, Thom was working as a lollipop-lady in Penge. The Eraser therefore represents a remarkable recovery.I like to sit out on my patio and listen to this record while dusk falls and I finish some knitting or tuck into a supper of pickled herring. At other times it does nothing for me. On balance then, is The Eraser worth buying? My definitive answer is 'maybe'."
1,aptly titled... this album would be worth more as an eraser.,"i know i'm not the only one out there who thinks radiohead has gone off the deepend musically. if you can stand kid a, and ""hail"" and thom yorkes meanless meandering vocals, then by all means, buy this...this album goes nowhere, and fast. by the end of track one, you have already wasted more time then necessary in trying to figure out this disc. thom yorke, i don't get you.. go back to making decent music, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel with all your recordings. i'm not impressed."
5,I'm sure it will be some sort of precedent eventually.,"Thom Yorke is a pro. He knows what he's doing. This is a really great album. I'm sure it won't be long before other peoples albums are being compared to this, because it does have a very signature sound. This is not a Radiohead album, and it's not supposed to be. So anybody mentioning Radiohead or comparing this to his Radiohead work really doesn't know what they're talking about. I'd definitely recommend this. Great work, Thom."
3,more of the same,"first few listens, it is good stuff. gets boring after a while.very similar to amnesiac /kid a"
2,I expected a bit of Radiohead in here.,and it doesn't sound like Radiohead at all.I like Yorke's voice and it works with Radiohead but falls flat here.Its now hitting cutout bins where it may be worth a try at a good price.It might have helped to have lyrics but none are found in the flat cardboard packaging of a plain black and white line drawn landscape.Its like all the color and life has been 'Erased' get it????This music is a an old black and white copy of a slice of life in a depressing flat world.Enter at your peril.....
3,Low-Budget Radiohead,"That Thom Yorke would eventually record an album relying solely on a computer for musical accompaniment should come as no suprise to anyone who has followed Radiohead's musical development over the years. Stylistically, ""The Eraser"" is probably closest to ""Amnesiac"". This isn't really good or bad, but one does get the sense that Thom is coasting, rather than attempting to yet again push the sonic envelope.While the the song compositions are fairly solid, and the lyrics and vocal delivery admirable, the production is a major weak point. The computer generated music often sounds like a low-budget version of Radiohead. There is also not a tremendous variation of music, tempo, or attitude between the individual songs, and consequently none stick out as superior to the rest.This album mainly comes off as a minor side project meant to tide fans over as they await the next Radiohead release. Taken as such, it will not disappoint."
3,The Eraser ~ Thom Yorke,"The music on this CD is OK, but it is not as good as what you would find on a Radiohead CD. Much more mellow than Radiohead."
3,sounds like Kid A......,"So I was very disapointed to buy the album and find it to be like Kid A. Kid A was my least favorite of radiohead. While I love all radiohead albums, for a started album for Thom Yorke, I was a little disapointed. I thought it would be a little more creative..however, I do like it, just not a album I would listen to all the time."
4,Thom Yorke - The Eraser,"I tried listening to Thom Yorke's ""The Eraser"" in a couple places - at work, in the car, and then at home at night with minimal lighting. This CD only worked for me on the last location (at home w/minimal lighting). I know that sounds weird but this is kind of a weird CD.It's not something you are going to want to put on constantly. It's something you need to be in a specific mood/attitude for. That said, I did like it. The more and more I hear of it, the better I think it is. This takes a little getting used to since there's no really big, bright choruses to grab you in.It's somewhere in between cool blippy background music and surreal futuristic music. I love Thom Yorke's voice no matter what he's singing. So overall, yes it's weird, but if you're of an open mind, and give it a few listens in the right setting, you should start to really dig it like I do."
5,Another masterpiece by Yorke,"It's as Radiohead released a new album. This one may not be an easy listening like Radiohead's Amnesiac or Kid A. Yes, I am talking about Radiohead because it's impossible to segregate Thom's solo work with his main band. This CD is weird the first time you listen, in the second time you start paying more attention to the lyrics, and say, oh well, there is good message and poetry here, in the third go you start to say ""this album is good"", and by the fifth time one is saying ""this is a masterpiece"". The album has several good tracks among I highlight ""The Eraser"", ""The Clock"", ""Black Swan"" (My fav), and ""Harrowdonw Hill"". If you are a truly fan of Radiohead, you will love it. If you are looking for catchy tunes, maybe you should buy another album."
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable,"I'd give this album 3 1/2 stars if I could, but I rounded up because I really quite enjoy it. I've always thought that Radiohead's albums are 30% mind-blowing genius, and 70% just okay, or worse, painfully dull. The Eraser is more of a middle-ground album...never brilliant, but consistently good and listenable throughout.Oh, and for the record, I couldn't disagree more with the people who are saying this music is a far cry from Radiohead's sound. Based on some reviews, I was expecting Thom Yorke singing over really terrible techno music, and it's really not like that at all. I think it's very comparable to Radiohead's more electronic albums, especially Hail to the Thief."
5,Psuedo Musical Intellectuals,"The Eraser is NOT Radiohead. Stop comparing it to the Band. This is merely an opportunity for Thom to do his own thing. Whether or not you like it, should be based on the sound of this album alone. You cannot compare this to Kid A or Ok Computer. Is Thom expected to play 5 different instruments at the same time? This album is very good....it is good because Thom went out on a limb and for that you have to respect him. He could have opted not to make the album and been scared of what all of you were going to say. He obviously doesn't care what some wannabe musicians (who draw inspiration from his work anyway) think of him. Stop analyzing texture, tone, vocals, etc....you are not a music critic...you just wish you had an ounce of his talent so that you could move out of your parents basement and do something real....the eraser is a great album if you are not an overanalyzing degenerate."
5,wonderful,"Amazon's review of this is bewildering - sometimes sounds like demos? What planet are you on? It was produced by one of the best producers around today. Whoever wrote that doesn't know much about music production. This album is tight, concise and superbly layered.It's also way more melodic than anything Radiohead has done since OK Computer, which was a shock to anyone expecting an electro beep fest. And what melodies! They're just beautiful. Thom Yorke's incredible voice has simply NEVER consistantly been this forward and clear on any album released by Radiohead.Unless you're determined to dislike it (cough, pitchfork tired of being accused of fellating Yorke, cough), you can not fail with this album."
3,"Too thin to need erasing, thick enough to appreciate","Thom Yorke's stab at a solo record will probably appeal to Radiohead fans, but those that don't like his band shouldn't quickly dismiss Yorke's album: it lacks the (faux?)-grandiosity that turns some away from Radiohead records. ""The Eraser"" is surprisingly modest, a collection of bare electronica pieces about environment and coldness and Dr. David Kelly. ""And It Rained All Night"" could rake in converts, while those less-skeptical folks should be able to make an ecstastic forty-one minutes out of pieces like the darkly slinking ""Black Swan"" (""Cause this is f____d up/F____d up"") or the one about Dr. David Kelly (""Harrowdown Hill""). There isn't enough to warrant four stars, but there's more than enough to defend this against those angry people ready to leap upon the record as mere trite Radiohead-lite."
3,"Pleasant, interesting, and repetetive.","This CD is interesting to listen to. When I first heard Black Swan, I was intrigued, and wanted to hear more. The problem is that almost every song on the CD sounds just like it. The same drum sound with some beeps and sound effects. Nothing amazing here, but still something I enjoy listening to. It sort of makes you realize how important the rest of Radiohead is, and leaves you yearning for some guitar and real drum kits to make the songs come alive. All in all it's mellow, creative, and is best listened to in the background."
3,"Good, but not Radiohead","I think that many assume that Thom Yorke's solo debut will be just another Radiohead album, but that's not quite right. It is clear that Yorke is a highly talented musician and lyricist, but the synergy that is present through all of Radiohead's albums is absent. Definitely worth a listen, but don't expect another In Rainbows."
3,Meh,I think I'll stick with Radiohead. It was so-so and unfortunately I think Thom missed the boat on this one.
4,good album,"nothing extraordinary (if you've listened to radiohead before). but in the end, if you like radiohead you'll definitely like the eraser. just one more album you can put between your kid a and your amnesiac."
5,Beautiful.,"This album blew my mind.I am speechless.To tell you the truth I didnt really know what to expect from The Eraser. I am a big radiohead fan, and as any, my favorite albums are The Bends and OK computer. So I was a little wary about the idea of Thom Yorke releasing an album, alone.As all of you know, the album did leak all over the net. So I gave most of the songs on the CD a good listen. Like I said before I was speechless. What a beautiful, powerful, hunting album this is.From the first listen I was hooked. And I know that it will only get better, because if I can admit after just one listen, that this album is amazing, then what will I think after the fourth, fifth, sixth, etc.?Now Im gonna go, get dressed and run out and buy the Eraser. Because, hell its that good!"
4,Feline,"Something strange happened when I was listening to ""The Eraser"" for the first time. Both of the cats in my apartment came into my bedroom when they heard the music, and sat down on the floor motionless, seemingly hypnotized by it. They've never done that before. Could it be that Thom Yorke's solo album spoke to them? That the noctural, sensual, shifty, melancholy songs somehow appealed to their feline sensibility? Who knows. All I know is that I was equally as enchanted as my feline friends."
5,Why Complain?,"Thom Yorke has created a very impressive solo effort. Radiohead (along with an older group, King Crimson) always surprises the listener with something new and innovative, and Yorke's influence on Radiohead is evident here. The heavily syncopated backgrounds on many of the songs remind one of an electronic samba/reggae mixture that also pops up in Radiohead's work. (This album plays well before listening to ""In Rainbows"".) Criticisms of this album as being a ""minor work"" when compared to Radiohead's albums are unjustified--it has just as unique a sound as each of the Radiohead albums but with a more personal touch.The album's first half is stronger than the second with ""Skip Divided"" being the weakest song that divides the nine selections."
4,Now We Know Yorke's True Influence In Radiohead,"Spectacular solo effort! It's too bad Yorke is foredoomed from having been gifted enough to construct albums that he'll probably never be capable of again -namely O.K. Computer and perhaps even The Bends. The songs Harrowdown Hill, Analyse and Black Swan are incredible. If you have enjoyed Radiohead's more electronic albums such as Kid A or Amnesiac then you should find a huge appriciation for The Eraser."
4,Decent.,"This album will probably take more than one listen to fully understand.Not to say that The Eraser isn't a good album, because it most definitely is, but without Radiohead, Thom Yorke sounds surprisingly dull. There are a few songs that, no matter how many times I try to like them, I must skip through everytime I listen to this CD.Definitely a good album, but nothing great, and definitely mediocre compared to any Radiohead album."
3,dissappointed,"I like some of the stuff, but other songs sounded like he intentionally wanted to make his listeners mad. There is very little that works on this album (it kinda reminds me of the latest Wilco album). Who know's though, maybe I'm just a musical idiot and Thom-o-boy really does know how to make good music still?"
2,Stick to Radiohead....,"Unimpressive. Leaves me wanting more RADIOHEAD!!! Its more electronic than most of RH's albums, which is fine since I love electronic music also. But Bjork can pull it off, Yorke (solo) can't, in MY OPINION!! Save your money... and wait it out for Radiohead's next release which should be coming out soon...."
4,Terrible packaging,"CD NOT REVIEWED - Just PACKAGINGThis is weak, did the artist insist upon this crappy paper (not even cardboard) packaging,ugh no wonder why the record industry is failing.Packaging is the ONLY reason we buy from the labels anymore otherwise get this from iTunes and print up better packing.Pretty Lame.I thought the labels did a poor job an the Beatles Capitol Albums box, but this is a new lowWhen did they stop caring?"
1,Thom Yorke erased any talent he had with this bucket of poo,The album is typical moaning and whining. If life is that bad than thom should just go ahead and kill himself. An irish wake has more cheer than this dredfully bad album. The songs sound like they were aranged by a group of schoolchildren high on a pepsi and chocolate binge. I would just go download the tracks for free if I was you because the cd will only be good to stick a cold beverage on after one listen.
2,The Worst DJ,"Music is at its best when it makes you feel something. Whether it makes you feel happy, sad, or like bobbing your head, music should be powerful in some way. Thom Yorke's CD and Radiohead seemed to forget that instruments make music, not computers. The only positive about this CD is Thom Yorke's voice, which is the only real instrument on the cd. This CD targets those who embrace apathy as if it were virtue. The CD as a whole is unmoving and emotionless. To see this in concert would look more like a man playing a computer game than actual music. Yorke used to play rock. What a shame. I gave up after 2 songs, but I'm sure there are plenty of you out there that will force yourselves to love it."
1,"NOT RADIOHEAD, SO NOT GOOD","This a good example of what's wrong with todays music.This guy is on such an ego trip he doesn't realize he can'tmake a successful album without his bandmates, one who made a very good instrumental solo album. He has absolutely no sense of melody and just seems to know his way around his laptop. Oh, he will have some fans who might feel sorry for him and some will enjoy the ""f"" word showing up. but count me out!"
1,When was the last time this dude got laid?,"Thom Yorke is the most boring person in rock right now. Zero charisma. He's sooooo uptight! Does he even know how to smile? Truth is, this album is not only overrated, but it's already selling CONSIDERABLY LESS than his albums with Radiohead. Anyhow, Justin Timberlake has a hot new single, ""SexyBack"" on the radio now. It will be available for digital download real soon. Get that instead."
4,Good Listen,If you liked Kid A you'll probably like this album. If you did not like Kid A you probably won't enjoy this album as well.
4,Never was a huge fan of Radiohead but I definitely dig Thom Yorke's solo work,"As a fan of idm/ambient electronica I stumbled upon this album from a friend's recommendation. This is a very interesting album from a production and song writing perspective. Very ethereal and subtle melodies that carry Yorke's voice like a steam train slowly building up speed. Recommended if you're into music thats different from most of todays mainstream garbage.Highlights: The Eraser, Black Swan , Skip Divided , And It Rained All Night, Harrowdown Hill ."
5,Impossible To Fault.,"Radiohead's music has grown increasingly insular over the past 3 albums or so and ""The Eraser"" is a beautiful extension of that ideal. Accepted on its own terms, Thom Yorke's solo foray into deep mystery, fractured emotions, paranoia and fear, is a stunning work remniscent of David Bowie's 70's peak (the highly regarded trinity of ""Low"", ""Lodger"" and ""Hunky Dory"")and will easily enrapture and relax any listener with an open mind.A great set of tunes!"
4,Erasure,"It's been a long time coming. More than 13 years after Radiohead's debut album comes Thom Yorker's solo outing, Eraser. Some say it's Amnesiac Part 2. You decide for yourself but with a palatable mix of chilly electronic and emo music, the Mercury-Prize nominated Eraser is as weird as it is ecletic. Once you revel in the music, pay attention to the lyrics and the record starts making more sense than before. The electronic stutters toward the end of the title track bring to mind Bjork. The trio of songs that closes the album makes for an extremely satisfying trip into a dark realm that Yorke has slowly drawn us in through the 9-course feast. Throughout the record, his distinctive vocals adds finesse to the entire project.A strong contender for the album of 2006.Recommended tracks: Black Swan, Harrowdown Hill, And It Rained All Night, The Eraser, Cymbal Rush(A+)"
4,a nice departure from Radiohead,"I will start off by saying that this solo album from radiohead frontman Thom Yorke will not have mass appeal . This album is almost entirely electronic , and minimalistic in it's approach . Sufficed to say , it is destined to alienate the casual listener . However , if you enjoy lush , ambient electro-soundscapes with emotive vocals ( and you are not a card carrying member of the A.D.D. generation ) then you may like this very intimate and personal album . Essentially , this is a stripped-down Radiohead . Thom Yorke seems to have a re-newed sense of purpose , he isn't just going through the motions like on previous -RH- albums . This is his most inspired work in years ."
3,"Not reviewing the CD, but the packaging SUCKS","I am quite certain the music Thom Yorke has put out is brilliant. I expect no less. However, ""The Eraser"" comes packaged in a muli folded paper Digipak(?), with the actual CD encased in a paper slipcover. Why can't artists just stick to the good old fashioned CD jewel case? Yes, I will transfer this CD to my iPod, but I STILL HAVE TO PUT THE CD SOMEWHERE. The Digipak is the worst idea ever. It doesn't fit in the slots of my CD rack, there is no spine to read even if I do put it in there. This really sucks. Not water resistant, not abrasion resistant. I'm sure this fancy packaging cost more than a jewel case. If Thom and his people want to give me artwork----give me a nice booklet IN THE JEWEL CASE. Prince and the RHCP have jumped on the Digipak bandwagon, and it sucks. I have CDs from the 80s that still look like new. I can't see that happening with Digipaks. DISCONTINUE THE STUPID DIGIPAK, PLEASE."
2,Yorke should not go Solo ever again,"If you are expecting a sound from Thom Yorke as good as the band he fronts, you will be disappointed. I do not believe this album is close to the quality of any Radiohead album. T.Yorke is too experimental with his solo debut. I am not impressed. ""The Erasure"" has glimpses of the brilliance of 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' but doesn't come close to matching either of Radiohead's most recent releases."
2,The Meandering Thom,"There are a few shining moments on this CD but as of the last couple of years, Mr. Yorke and company have veered so far away from what they are truly good at: writing good songs. While I appreciate the detours this band has taken to broaden their sound, it's depressing to see a band this great forge ahead in such aimless ways. Mr. Yorke compounds the problem here. Some good songs but overall this CD is a bore. Nobody is asking him or them to duplicate The Bends or OK Computer, but this isn't working in the slightest any more and one would seem to think that they would want to get back and just write some good songs. Not everything in the world is disaffected and disassociated and Radiohead and Mr. Yorke seem hellbent on staying in that very rut."
5,Amnesiac & Kid A fans are in for a treat!,"""Amnesiac"" is my favorite Radiohead album, with ""OK Computer"" and ""Kid A"" very close behind. I never gave ""Hail to the Thief"" a chance so I guess I basically gave up on Radiohead at that point... well, now I bought Thom Yorke's solo album because it sounds right from that era... and just as solid!How someone can create an instant CLASSIC like this, I don't know, but I am very pleased with this album. It has a dark mood, and the percussion elements are very strong (experimental & electronic). Yorke's voice, the usual haunting, emotional tone is enjoyable as always.Do NOT hesitate on getting this album if you like Radiohead from their finest hours!"
1,disapointed,"Being a Jeep fan, I was disapointed in this video. I was expecting vintage footage, and a nice history. Instead, I got advertising footage from the '80's on the XJ model. What this video contains, is little more than a list of models made by Jeep. I would guess that the target audience would be someone who is interested in learning the basics of the jeep history, not someone who already knows any of it. The driving instructions might be interesting to someone who has yet to venture onto their first dirt road, but not much there for a veteran."
4,excellent bag!,"very convenient bag, contain lots of pockets and spaces for diapers, bottles and baby clothes"
4,DC Cooper rocks,"DC Cooper can sing with the best of them. The band sounds a lot like Priest and Maiden, and the muscianship is excellent. The triology on this disc is weak, but the rest of the songs rock. This is a must buy for any fan of screaming heavy metal."
4,"groove sucka, jam sucka, then buy this album","I just cant give 5 stars but this album above many should have got it! Rage Against The Machine have truly outdone themselves (and these arent even their songs) Powerful, and above everything else, useful, these guys...just ROCK.Please figure out your differences.The Devo remake although slow, does remind me of a time when all I thought was the next Rage song I would hear on the radio.Pistol Grip Pump.... need I say more?Tom Joad, a hungry new born baby cries for more R.A.T.M.Kick Out The Jams (as only RAGE can do)BUY THIS ALBUM. It hasnt left my CD player for days."
3,short,"This album on cd is great. Not every song however is, but there is a wealth of material to make up for it. The vinyl however takes, arguably, the best tracks from a 2 disc set and puts them onto one lp. Its good, but missing some of the less popular tracks i love."
3,Renegades,"`Renegades' is RATM's covers album and although it's not as fresh or immediate as their other albums, it has plenty to offer existing fans. `Pistol Grip Pump' has an awesome sound and never fails to get me psyched up and ready for the rest of the album, `Kick Out the Jam' is a particular highlight and their rendition of Springsteens `The Ghost of Tom Joad' makes for an interesting and apt take on an already excellent song. As an overall album this doesn't sit together that well and if you're new to RATM then I'd suggest you try their debut first before coming to this later on down the line. But, as an example of what they can do with other peoples material and to see their influences out in the open this makes for good listening. No where near their strongest album but worth a listen at some point.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,a dying breed!,"Although this album is more hip-hopish than the others it makes a great addition to the Rage legacy, Zack de la Roca is and excellent lead singer/rapper!! tom morello mastery of the guitar is excellent! good album!! a must have!!"
1,Finally they will STOP...,"Rage Against the Machine should go down in history as the band with the most rediculous song lyrics ever. They just sing about taking down the government and stuff...they are a bunch of pathetic socialists. Problem is, under their desired socialist system, they wouldn't even be allowed to say the things they do. They just talk trash about a government that protects their right to say what they want. What is their problem??Not to say the music itself is much better. All they do is play the same guitar riff the whole song while their terrible singer spits out rap then starts screaming like a tortured weasel. Not to say their riffs are bad, they are kinda catchy, but it is over and over until you get sick of it.My advice to you is to avoid this and if you're looking for real heavy music, go get yourself a copy of Linkin Park's debut."
3,"Fourth album, fourth on the list","RATM is very unique. They are one of the few bands that I am into that peaked with their debut album. Their self-titled was better than Evil Empire, Evil Empire was better than the Battle of L.A., and this album is better than Renegades. Their first album was a landmark album and was way ahead of its time. I guess when I think of the latter three albums, each sticks out in my mind for one killer song: ""Bulls on Parade"", ""Guerilla Radio"", and ""Renegades of Funk"". But with their first album, their was no clear best song. They all rock! Still worthy without a doubt though."
3,KarlMarx is a dork,"KarlMarx is a dork, he likes Anime. Renegades has some good songs, Renegades of Funk and the Ghost Of Tom Joad (though how many times are they gonna issue this song? Its been on the Godzilla soundtrack, the RATM live movie free CD, the Guerilla Radio single b-side, what a bunch of money grabbers, SOAD wouldn't do that. I recommend buying a SOAD album before this because SOAD has way more variation on their sound."
1,Stick RATM in the deep frier with Mumia.,"When rage against the machine sold out to sell more records, I was in shock. I mean, it is just a matter of time before greed catches up with any hit artist these days, but I thought Rage would be different because of their passion against corruption. However, I was wrong and I've witnessed rage play to the masses with the same stagnated style and even try such publicity stunts as supporting known murderer Mumia to sell records. Anyway, this album is no different from their last two, even though I was hoping that it would instill the fire that their first self titled album did. I wasted my money. Don't give these sellouts' label any of yours."
1,MOLOTOV wipes the floor with r.a.t.m.,"MOLOTOV is the only Real Rap/Metal Band out there that really matters,they are from Mexico but belive me they are a million times better and more raw than that electronica based mainstream ""Rage against the machine"".Want proof? listen to their album ""Donde jugaran las ninas"" and judge for yourself."
3,Worst RATM album yet.,"Well, I've been a rage fan since their first self titled release. As their fourth album release, it's definitly sub-par. This album is totally covers, which include anything from Cypress Hill to Bob Dylan. Pistol Grip Pump is very well done, along with Renegades of Funk. If you like RATM, you'll like this album. First, buy their other albums."
3,Before you buy this version...,"...Note that the 'bonus tracks' arent Australia only. 'Maggies Farm' and 'How I Could Just Kill a Man' are also on the U.S. version(they just arent listed as tracks). Since this one is alot more dough than the U.S. version, and they are basically the same, you would want that version instead."
5,Renegades,"This is a very good Rage Against the Machine album. Every song minus one is upbeat and incredible. I really enjoy this album, it is one of my favorite Rage Against the Machine albums of all time."
3,have to say it: the recording quality is poor,"I really do like this album. Especially ""in my eyes"". But, it's difficult to listen to due to really bad recording or mix. I'm no audiophile snob but the bass is way overdriven and it just sounds like bad equipment when I play it on any stereo in my house; the computer; or in the car. Whatever you do, don't use this CD to judge stereo equipment. It's the best example I know of a bad recording in this day and age. Let me repeat, I do like the music."
2,It was okay,"This CD didn't live up to what Rage is known for. I will say that ""Renegades of Funk"" is my favorite rage song of all time."
5,Microphone Fiend,Wow... Rage never ceases to impress. This cover track is breathed new life and made into a song fit for today. It is a wonderful mix of Zack's rapping an Tom Morello's very impressive guitar riffs. The only thing regrettable about this album is that there won't be another.
2,"God, this is RATM, what the hell happened","Come on, this is too slow for the kings of ""RAGE"" whatever happened to having any rage. And when, may i ask, did Zack feel that he was all hip hop and no metal. Rage is metal, all metal, and nothing can change it. Zack always incorporated hip hop, but not like this, damn this is the worst album of theirs and i cannot believe this is how they are going out. This is nothing, like the real Rage, i miss them, why don't they come back?"
2,why people are possibly calling this the best rage album eve,"i think this album is ok but not ok for rage's potential. i think like korn, every album by rage gets worse than the one before. this one does not show the artistic talent that evil empire and their self-titled one do. might i say that r. of funk is so overplayed. i think that doing an all-cover album was a huge mistake because it's not rage. they're are now 2 good songs (used to be 3 but i don't like r. of funk anymore) on this disc. cypress hill's ""how i could just kill a man"" and ""in my eyes"". otherwise this is a huge diappointment."
1,rage against your message,"Can anyone say cashing in? Yeah. Its hard to take a leftist political band on a major label seriously. Zach quitting is the best thing that could have happened to them. Can someone please explain to me how climbing up and sitting on a prop at the mtv video music awards furthers your cause? Right, it doesn't. But Tom Morrello looked super cute on the cover of rolling stone.This CD makes a good coaster."
3,RATM- Renegades CD Product problem,"I really like RATM. This album would be one of the best RATM has produced to date. However, this CD is very poor in production quality. Every track on the CD is clipped. This distortion is audible on even low quality stereo equipment like PC speakers.I gave it 3 stars for being excellent music, and it lost 2 stars for the poor production quality of the tracks. In fact, I am returning the CD until they get it right. Nobody should have to pay ... for this kind or poor quality. Epic Records and Sony Music Entertainment should re-produce this CD with the proper dynamic range for a quality sound product. I am surprised with the producer ""Rick Rubin"" and at the co-producers RATM for letting such a poor quality product go out into the world. Hardly representative of their talents.It sounds like an old LP that has 1Million+ spins and the tracks are worn out. I'd personally rather hear the intentional distortion of the band and not the production distortion of the process."
5,Unique! That's the only way to describe RATM!,"Have you noticed that there are no bands that sound like Rage did? Some have tried (Limp Bizkit for one) and failed magnificently. No one will be able to match the awesome, ferocious, funky sound of Rage! There is no term to describe Rage but here is how I describe them Hard funk rock! This CD contains a few cover songs, but that's okay, its a good album anyway. I can't wait to hear how the new group Audioslave (with three remaining members of Rage and Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell) sounds. Hopefully, its not a Rage rip off. I hope no band ever succeds at trying to sound like Rage Against The Machine, because these guys are a style all their own."
5,A Must Have on your Vacation to Germany & Austria,"We took this book along with us on trip to Germany and Austria and found it indispensable. Steve's hotel and sight-seeing information is well researched and accurate. Steve's books cater to the rail traveler, but traveling by car is just as easy and more economical if you have a family - not to mention that it allows you much more freedoom to explore. Make sure you have good detailed maps of the places you will be traveling to, as the maps Steve provides are hand drawn and not extremely detailed. We found that many American's use Steve's book to travel, so making friends by talking about Steve's book is a great conversation starter. Make sure you also ask about the discounts that hotels and services offer through Steve's book."
1,Avoid this book.,"While this book is tolerable for the first semester of organic chemistry, it falls flat on its face for the second semester. Simple reactions are given full page mechanisms while other reactions like 'reducing of carbonyl groups to methylene groups' are given no mechanisms! The writing is pure garbage, with the author rambling on for pages to give simple answers like 'resonance.' Don't even bother with the solutions manual because it has no real solutions. Instead it has just answers with perhaps a sentence of poor explanation, and sometimes even questions in the answers! If I'm reading the solutions manual it's pretty apparent that I don't know the answer, so why are you asking me questions in the solutions manual?!Save yourself the frustration and buy something else."
1,It was so dirty,"I bought this book as used one.However, it was so dirty to use it because it was covered lots of drawing and writing"
3,Horrible at explaining.,"Ok to keep it short... The text is great but the author is horrible at explaining chemistry. I found myself confused a lot of the time and wasting the precious time I have to do homework, rereading over and over until it made sense then I would get the biggest sense of frustration because I spend so much time rereading a concept that is not that hard. Bottom line is the author can't explain for his life and if you have to get this book you better have Khans Academy on bookmark."
3,Great text for organic chemistry,"This textbook is the best I've seen for learning organic chemistry - the author is clear and precise, though the chapter organization takes some getting used to. The only reason I gave this 3 instead of 5 is because my specific order was not what I expected. The seller said the book was in pristine condition, but it actually had some pencil writing and highlighting in it. If I would have known, I would not have paid the few extra dollars for ""like new"" condition and instead would have paid less for a book from a seller that did not lie about its condition. (please note, this was an independent seller, not Amazon)"
1,"First- glance science, Second glance- English","My Profile:Chemistry/Physics dual majorReview:Bought this book for class. My bias opinion of this book is that it's not for me. I picked it up hoping to learn something from it, instead I'm met with 2000 pages of words. Words are nice, but I'm use to reading grad styled books >> less talk more show. I recommend ""Organic Chemistry"" by Wade over this text, and now regret lending my Wade book to a friend.PS: to the author- stop trying to describe orbitals with paragraphs until you've taken quantum mechanics, your analogies are bull. I don't care if you're a well renowned chemist, but as a physicist I am applaud at how orbitals hybridize magically to fit the necessary bonds, and justified with 5 pages of the ""that's just the way it is"" approach."
3,"Good, but not good enough","This is a great introductory textbook for organic chemistry, but for accelerated chemistry courses, it simply failed to give more advanced materials and examples.I ended up getting another organic chemistry textbook to complement it. Still one of the most understandable organic textbook around, though."
3,An Acceptable Organic Text,"This is the text we teach from in the accelerated organic course at Harvard. While it is a very readable text, and that is important, it is not very technical and many definitions (see Curtin Hammet principle) are just plain incomplete. A good text for a simple course but no real weight here."
3,Dark Eye,"I read this book to its end. The writing itself is well done but the characterization was so intense that I finished it feeling tense. I've read other stuff by this same writer and this book was no doubt one of his earlier books. A man implants an alien element into a small girl which causes her to take on and cure other people's diseases. The characters make a few wild character changes. Worth a read, though."
3,Still a politician...,"Overall a better read than I had expected. I have some criticisms, the most serious of which is the author's inability, for most of the book, to break away from his politician's habit of campaigning. Indeed, every time things start to get interesting, he holds back. He has the politician's sanctimonious habit of bringing up his religion at every turn and mythologizing his origins. Descriptions of political wheeling and dealing are tedious and are better skimmed by most readers. And his description of rehab is cringe-worthy; how does a twelve-step program turn an intelligent and confident adult into a drooling idiot? He would have done better to go on vacation in Mexico... Finally, the book includes a picture of the author with his present partner but not a word is written about this presumed happy ending. At least an epilogue would have been nice."
3,TOO POLITICAL,The beginning of the book was very good but as it progressed it was just too much politics for me and not nearly enough about Mc Greevey's life!
3,The Disappointment,"One could call this book a memoir and it is somewhat self-serving. McGreevey attempts to point out all of the good he did in political life while explaining/defending/excusing his behavior and mistakes. I was saddened as I finished the book because I think he is essentially a good man with good intentions; he just went wrong, lost his way and basically failed to accomplish what he could/should have done. The book is also quite a sad comment on the state of politics in this country: McGreevey details the corruption, obsession with power and the need to be overly concerned with the implications of every action/decision."
4,The Confession,I most definately enjoyed reading Mr. McGreevey's ride to the top.I only regret that he quit without a fight. Did not feel it necessaryfor him to resign because of his sexual orientation.
1,McGreevey embarks upon a journey of self indulgence...,"Poor Jim has finally embraced his true self, he has owned his mistakes and his confession has set him free and absolved him of all crimes. For you know, any crime is acceptable, as long as you confess, use the right psycho-babble, and blame it all on those who kept you from embracing your true self. What a load of ****! Anyone who buys this line is a sucker."
5,"Gives new meaning to the term, New Jersey Turnpike rest stop.","l have to make a confession, l loved this book! Jim McGreevey is proof that with hard work and dedication, any boy can grow up to be Queen of New Jersey. This gets my vote."
4,"Interesting, but.........","An interesting read. Compelling and emotionally involving. I truly commiserated with McGreevey. While I am not gay, as someone raised catholic I understood the catholic guilt aspect and really felt for him. My only problem with the entire book is that I wonder if McGreevy would have been willing to give up the charade if he basically didn't have that proverbial gun put up to his head.As for his object of desire, I totally bought into his description of this appealing man until I saw him being interviewed on Larry King. Either the boyfriend Golan is the smarmiest liar on the planet or the biggest victim."
1,He's No Barney Frank! Don't say I didn't warn you about him!,"When congressman Barney Frank feared getting outed, he didn't go and get married like Jim did. Frank came out and admitted his sexual orientation and became more popular than ever. Jim however married twice and had children. His sexual activities were quite common to lots of people even in his city of Woodbridge. Jim's not a role model for any ""Gay American."" Jim used it as an excuse to hide from the political shortfall of his administration. Nobody told him what to do ever. His family would have still loved him regardless of his sexual orientation. The scene broadcasted on television announcing his resignation failed to show the fact that he was the leader of the most corrupt administration in our state's history. As for Jim's book, he's clearly in love with himself and now he's getting thousands of Americans to be suckered like I was (twice) into supporting him. Don't say you weren't warned!"
4,A Man Shares from His Heart,I have enjoyed reading the book. There is a great deal of political information in the book about Jim's move through the political forces. Right when you have had enough of all the political talk he opens his heart and bares his frailties. Jim has been criticiezed for writing the book for monetary gain and they may be partly true but the way he honestly shares all of his life truly took courage. His two past wives and his two daughters may very well be embarrassed by the things Jim reveals about himself in the book. Hopefully at some point his family may see his honest attempt to share what made him the man he is today.
1,not as expected,"Because it is under Nature and Music, I was misled to think there was music. Some people may like just the nature noises."
5,Emersed in Nature!,"This CD is one of the best nature CD's I've heard! It Creates an environment of total peace and tranquility. Not overbearing with a mass of sounds. You can pick out the Cardinal calling for his lover, the Robin, the Bull frog.Excellent for those city dwellers who crave an escape from the highrises and pavement!"
5,From the Heart,"The Path to School Leadership: A Portable Mentor is the journey of a year in the life of a principal. It's an inspiring overview of the triumphs and tribulations that leaders may face. Through Bolman and Deal's use of the four frame strategies, real-life situations are created for a clear visualization of leadership qualities. Whether a new administrator or not, this book is a must! It will open your mind as well as your heart. As Bolman and Deal so eloquently state, ""The book will help you find new paths to confidence and success- and deepen your contribution to the students and staff members who count on you for leadership."""
3,What Goes Around...,"A helpful book which provides insight into some common pitfalls that a first year principal is likely to encounter. School politics, culture, and opposition are among some of the many topics explored between the mentor principal and the rookie principal. As expected, the rookie grows to become a colleague and an equal to the mentor. The rookie becomes the mentor to another first year principal who has the same overwhelmed feeling that he himself had felt five years before. The concepts in this book is then distilled into five signposts that can be utilized by a practicing principal as they are learning the ropes. I especially liked the CAIRO method to committee work. Sorry, you will have to read the book to see what the CAIRO method is."
4,Calling all Principals!,"""The Path to School Leadership"" provides a ""roadmap"" for success for practicing administrators. Bolman and Deal's ""frames"" assist us in developing strategies for responding to seemingly overwhelming situations. Like Rodriquez, I have ""augmented my book knowledge with wisdom that can only be gained from experience and practice"". The wisdom I've gained through sometimes hurtful and stressful situations has made me much stronger and more confident. After serving as an administrator for one year, I have begun to develop a greater understanding of organizational change and an appreciation of conflict and new ideas. This book confirms the value of mentoring in the field of educational leadership. Who better to listen, give advice, and encourage us than someone who's been there before. Veteran adminstrators, we need your help!"
3,Organizational Frameworks for Dummies,"While not great literature, ""The Path to School Leadership"" does provide real life applications to theory. This book follows a new principal through his first year, documenting the various situations that arise. The new principal is soon swimming in unfamiliar waters, and decides to find himself a mentor. This mentor helps him to process information and directs him to possible courses of action. (The reader often feels Bolman and Deal speaking through the mentor.) This book is a great follow-up read to ""Re-framing Organizations"" by the same authors."
4,Your Right Hand,"A question that is on the minds of all first year prinipals. Do I have what it takes? It can indeed become overwhelming when we have to deal with new administrative duties, policies, and procedures. Jaime Rodriquez got first hand experience when he became principal. He found himself in tough situations that required good decisions. However, he cannot receive all the glory, because without Dr. Brenda Conner providing a good support system then all his efforts would have truly failed.Jaime Rodriquez allowed Dr. Conner's experience and expertise guide him through tough decisions.I would recommend this book to all principals and everyone aspiring to become a principal. It stresses the need that everyone should have a support system that has the expertise to lead you as a professional in the right direction."
5,Honest memoir,A common pornography reads like a dairy. It's a collection of short essays about his life. I was moved by his honesty. Great read.
4,Quite good -,"This little book was amusing, insightful, well-crafted ... but could've been at least twice the length to flesh out the situations & define the characters."
5,I Enjoyed Every Moment!,"Almost Home is a wonderful, engrossing book and kept me reading long past midnight. I especially loved the hero, Zach. Mmmmhmmm. I was also immediately drawn to the setting--Kentucky bluegrass country--as well as the very interesting background of thoroughbred horse racing. Almost Home is a keeper, romantic without being unrealistic, and with a surprise twist at the end. Once again, Barbara Freethy has written one from the heart!"
3,Entertaining,"This was an easy read to pass a rainy, lazy day. I would recommend this book for that purpose. For the most part this book held my attention - the main male character was written well enough that I would have wanted to meet him."
3,Abrupt ending...,"This is a good story but unlike her other books, this one ends abruptly. The story builds up moderately slowly, it gains momentum and suddenly in one chapter all is explained and ended. It seemed to me that the author was in a rush to end the story. I was disappointed at it since this was the first book I read from this author. I gave the author another chance, and I read her other book ""The sweetest thing"" which I absolutely loved and would recommended to anyone who enjoys some romantic and well-written novel."
2,Not Freethy's Best,"I didn't particularly like this book. I like to know the main characters and feel that I care about them. Claire was the only character I felt this way about and she had only a small part in the book. The premise of the book was good, but somehow it just left something to be desired. I would not recommend this book, although I would recommend this author and most especially, Daniel's Gift."
3,Not that great :( but not horrible,"Cute, I guess. Not that much Gorey and not what I was looking for. Not wretched, but not very useful unless perhaps you're looking for a chuckle."
3,Enjoyable Character But Story Getting A Little Thin,"Irony abounds in this latest hit man installemnt but it feels like even Block is getting tired of this hit-man-with-a-lunch-box plot. Still worth reading for the interplay between Keller (the hit man) and his agent, Dot."
4,First Time Reading This Author,"Not usually my type of book, but really enjoyed it. I will now have to get the others in the series. I thought the concept of the story was great, a stamp-collecting hit man! Who would have thought something like that up?!"
2,Disappointing.,"I enjoyed the previous John Keller-Hit Man books by Lawrence Block, who has been one of my favorite authors for many years. But this one fell kind of flat. In the earlier books, Keller has a certain charm, despite being a professional killer. For some reason, in this outing Keller comes across simply cold-blooded and inhuman. I think the author took away Keller's formerly interesting personality and all of his charm. This book is not really a novel, but rather a series of short stories about various hits Keller is hired for. Perhaps this is why Keller's character suffers this time out. I am hoping for a much better book with the latest Keller novel, HIT AND RUN."
3,"Yes, He Is","I really like Laurence Block, and I've read a couple of Kellers that I liked as well. Perhaps I've just started thinking more about what Keller is actually DOING, and less about the humor and the good writing. It's pretty sick, actually, and saying he ""needs the work"" in order to buy stamps a bit tough to swallow.I think I'll skip the rest of these."
2,Who would have thought a hired assassin could be such a dull guy?,"I've read several of Block's novels but this was my first exposure to his hit man character, Keller. None of these stories (each chapter is a separate story) are, well, very interesting. There is very little suspense or anticipation of what will happen next. Before you can care one way or the other about his victims, they're dead. Not much build up or background - they're like cardboard people that we don't get to know much about. Even the methods Keller uses are mundane.I was expecting more of an edgy personality in a profesional killer. Keller is just a boring guy whose obsession is stamp collecting. The more interesting sections are his interactions with his agent, Dot. However she's another flat character. If Block had dug a little deeper into the lives of these two, he might have captured my interest more. I just never felt engaged by either the characters or the stories. It was a disappointing read from a talented writer."
1,Deadly Boring,"I check out this book on Friday evening from the library and took it back on Monday morning. I only got to the First three chapters and I couldn't make and further. I tried really hard. Some book take you on the first chapter and some you have to get halfway before any action takes place. this is one of those books. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible"
1,One of the more boring books I've tried to read,this is from the guy who wrote those great Matthew Scudder books?
3,The hit man's hit man,"John Keller is the hit man's hit man. He has a code of honor that would seem twisted to us. He looks at it as his job, a problem to be solved and doesn't take it personally. He is quiet and efficient. His thoughts of retirement are daunted by the money he spends on his passion for collecting stamps. Dot, his contact who sets up the jobs for him, knows of his doubts and loneliness.Murder mysteries are one of my favorite genres and I love the character of John Keller. Makes the thought of a hit man likeable, if such a thing is possible. I keep hoping he will find some peace and happiness."
4,Good but flawed,"I love Lawrence Block, and I love the character Keller. This book is quite good until it becomes disjointed and episodic. Where'd the plot go?Still, there's a lot to like because Block can flat-out write. Keller is a compelling character, a hit man, who is obsessed with his stamp collection. I also like Dot, the woman who arranges the hits. Their conversations provide interesting, strong dialogue.There's a few things that don't work. Wouldn't it be easier for Keller just to shoot his victims? Does he really need to come up with unusual ways to kill them? Also, I could have done without the animal cruelty.After having pointed out my criticisms, I'll read anything Block writes about Keller in the future."
3,Contract Obligation Book?,"I've always enjoyed Lawrence Block's Hitman series, but he mailed it in on this one. The story just meanders with no purpose and the characters were not at all true to their former incarnations. The end is very disappointing. It's like he just quit when he reached a certain number of words/pages required."
3,"Read, don't listen to this one",I really don't know if I liked this book or not. I got it in audiobook form and was so distracted by the author's monotone reading that I missed most of the storyline. Authors should not read their own material. It takes an actor to make a book come to life.
4,One of the best CDs I have,"It's really one of the albums I like most. Just to mention some tracks, try ""An Affair to remember"", ""East of the Sun"" and ""I've got the World on a String"". Wonderful!"
3,Slap bass only,"I expected funk bass handbook - I am dissapointed. It is slap bass handbook.If you are interested in slap handbook it may be a good book. If you expect general funk handbook - don't buy. Funk started much earlier than slap style become popular. Its a pity it not covers important funk styles like New Orlean Funk, Jazz-Funk of sixties or Tower of Power 16th note style. Funk bass is much more than slapping and popping."
3,"Great Book, but CD Poorly Composed","This book has some great Funk grooves, but the CD is horribly composed.The CD omits chapters 3 & 4, which contain fantastic grooves, but no way to get a sample. It only covers chapters 5 & 6.The grooves are not separated individually, but rather, in large groups, so you can't just go to the groove you want, but have to scan.I can't believe this great teacher and player could have released such an ill-conceived CD tool.Although he is a great player, he uses some sort of Chorus pedal or something with the CD, so his tone ends-up sounding cheesy. He's a great player that didn't need any effects to record the samples.Sorry to be so harsh, but I really could have used an easier to navigate the CD.Take a look at Bass Guitar for Dummies by Patrick Pfeiffer. Really well-designed CD, although no depth of Funk like Liebman's."
5,Feel Good Fantasy!,"I wondered when someone would come up with a fantasy that takes us out of the world of the occult and gives us something to smile about. This story offers lots of adventure and excitement, but also addresses some real-life problems we all face. Highly recommend for kids of all ages! I can hardly wait to read the next in the series!"
5,An ESSENTIAL,"I bought this album years ago, and loved it instantly. Usually when I dig an album so much its appeal fades quickly. Not so with this one. I've given it to many people over the years and EVERY, absolutely EVERY time they have loved it too. It's worth the money. If you like obscure ""funky"" music, this is filled with very rare gems that should never have faded off the charts. It's not the George Clinton style of 70's funk, it's late 50's and early 60's - the originals!"
3,A little slow but well worth reading,Though this is by no means Van's best novel - written as it was at the forefront of his second wave of output that peaked in the 70s - the brilliant and unexpected turns in the last few chapters of the book make the sometimes dull plot worth enduring.
5,Another keeper from Calder,This is another fine reference book from Nigel Calder! I think that this book along with a good factory type manual would be all you needed to maintain your diesel engine. I have yet to purchase a book that Calder has authored that was not worth the money.
3,"A good reference, but a but too technical, even for a technical guy.","A good reference, but a bit too technical. I was a machinist and would not even dream of attempting some of the repairs suggested. Removing, cleaning and replacing internal engine components is something I would only attempt if I was broken down in the jungle, many miles from civilization."
3,Excellent Reference Book,I purchased this book to understand better the diesel Volvo 200 HP turbo engine on my sailboat. It certainly helped me with that objective. I feel comfortable tackling many projects and when I need a professional I'll be able to negotiate with him.
3,i need information about marin diesl engine,i need mor information about marine diesl engine to study and take expariance
4,Diesel Engines,"As a diesel engine boat owner, this is just what I needed to feel confident about how to keep my engine in tip-top shape."
3,The narrator absolutely ruins this book,"The woman who narrates this book is terrible. The author's actual writing is good, poignant, therapeutic, and comforting, but I had to constantly try to tune out the narrator's obnoxious and melodramatic rendition of the text. Her voice changes from a condescending, cloying and excessively pitying tone during most of the text to an inappropriate and downright nasty one for most quotes the author has included from ""real stories"" she has encountered. I started dreading the real-life quotes because I knew the narrator would switch to the rude, mocking voice she used for the quotes. It's really a shame, because much of what is written in this book is valuable information, even if it probably should be common sense (common sense, after all, isn't so common). I recommend the BOOK, but avoid the audio version if you possibly can - or spare yourself and get the abridged one because hearing this woman's melodrama is truly a trial all by itself."

1,An AA/ Al Anon 12 Step Book,"I was interested in how past childhood experiences affect co-dependency (there are no alcoholics or drug addicts in my pre-marital past) and bought this book to get a better understanding of co-dependency in general. Instead, I received an A/Al Anon 12 step program manual disguised as a self help book. Having lost a spouse to the cult of A.A., the last thing I was interested in was more 12 step higher power speak, and this book is chock full of it. Had the author mentioned anywhere in the title that the book was 12 step based, I could have saved my money and gotten a more useful book. If you're interested in 12 step based recovery literature, they hand out the Big Book free at A.A and Al Anon meetings; save yourself some money."
4,to die in Jerusalem,"Great documentary, but embarassing to buy a DVD from Amazon. I used to be a big DVD buyer there, but like with this latest one, I invited a lot of friends to see it. 3/4 toward the end of the movie, the DVD froze and stopped playing. We never saw the end of it. My DVD player is not the problem, as other DVD's played well and it's a great unit. The DVD is of a bad quality, and I am tired of trying to find a receipt to return the DVD.. so be warned!"
2,Buy thick posterboard instead,"The price for these dividers is kind of high, considering that you can simply buy thick posterboard for $2-$3 and make 16, 32, or 64 dividers yourself. Works just as good. You can just slide it into the slot on the center of the drawers."
2,Good but massively overpriced,"While they are much better dividers than the ones you cut from the back of the cabinet, they are very expensive. A pack of 16 should be $2-4 not $10. I am glad I didnt purchse more than one packet, I cut out cardboard for all the other dividers I needed and they work fine."
1,Why would you buy these ?,"Sure, they work as dividers, but at $.50 a piece they're absurdly priced.There are so many alternatives to these if you have any skill. You can even use hot melt glue to affix your dividers if they're not perfect."
3,Fine product but why sell separately???,The drawer dividers work fine - but it is frustrating in the extreme that they must be purchased separately from the drawers. Why on Earth can't Akro include some dividers with the purchase of the drawers???
2,Product definitely needs improvement,"The material is good, but the overall shape needs some changes.The ridges on the sides of the dividers need to be inset ~~ 1/16 inch so that they fit better into the molded slots in the sides of the plastic storage trays. The top surface should have a notch in it so that the divider won't catch on the restraint tab at the top of the frame. These weaknesses can be compensated for with a sharp knife, but this is time consuming!"
1,Akro-Mils 40716 Accessory. They should include these dividers with the purchase of the drawer orginizer,"I feel that Akro-Mills should provide these dividers as part of the purchased product. It is such a plain item I was inspired to make it my own and refuse to pay such highly priced item. If I were to purchase these divider the cost to include a divider for each of the 64 drawer is $ 25.84+ the shipping This means that the drawer and dividers would have cost me about $60.00 and I purchased 6 sets of 64 drawer organizers. and that's $360.00 WOW! : (Akro-Mils 40716 Accessory Dividers for Plastic Storage Hardware Cabinet Small Drawers, Pack of 16"
1,Non existing,"I ordered this item, paid for it and now it is not in stock and is going to be refunded. I can't find it anywhere. Driving me crazy. If anyone knows of another item that will work, please write."
1,WAY too blue,"I buy hi-wattage bulbs for improved night-driving vision. These bulbs are for the rice boys who want their headlights to look colored to other drivers, not for serious night-time drivers.The light output is so blue that night vision is actually blurry. For real driving at speed on open highway after dark, these bulbs aren't half as good as original equipment."
4,This is a GOOD german<->english frequency dictionary,"This has a good vocabulary of over 4034 words, although only 4034 are defined in the second group. Overall, I think it is FAIRLY well done. There ARE a few things I don't like, but I write this having seen the SPANISH version as well!The first group, which is in order of frequency(most to least), has sections where common categories(such as fruit or animals) are listed EVEN if they aren't in the top 4034. Usage is also shown. Unlike some frequency lists, a word counts ONLY in its base form. Verstehe will NOT be listed, for example, because the base form of verstehen IS.The second group includes only the first 4034 of the first group, but they are listed in alphabetical order. The english word/s is/are also shown.The THIRD group is like the second, but ONLY a limited number are listed, and they are listed in alphabetic order under word form. So, I like it, but I wish it were more complete, like your spanish version."
3,Oasis Aria,"On the positive side: Light weight, compact and easy to fold, fun colors, works great with my graco car seat.The negative side: The sun shade doesn't provide any protection! the cup holder is to small for most drinks, and the wheels twist and turn uncontrollably, unless you lock them straight, but then of course you can't turn! Also the harness (between the babies legs) is so far forward my baby keeps sliding down.I wish I had done more research before buying the Aria."
2,OK stroller,"The biggest plus of this stroller is that it is really lightweight. There are way too many minuses: the sunshade does not shade from anything, the basket is hard to acces and pretty small, when I hung my diaper bag on the handle of the stroller I wasn't able to recline the seat all the way and the seat of the stroller sits very low to the ground."
4,Good in the kitchen,"Bought these speakers to fill an unusual (tall, thin) cabinet space in a kitchen. They do the job nicely, particularly at higher volumes. At lower volumes, the bass tends to drop off, but the sound remains crisp, unlike other speakers I listened to in the same price range."
2,Ice review,Plot was very predictable and contrived. I could have easily put this book down and not even finished it. I find this true of the five of McBain's books I bought. Purchased five because they were offered at a very low price but felt as if I wasted my money.
3,Definitley Ok....,"Definitely Ok...This book is about a girl named Roxanne, who is about to start middle school. She wants to be popular and make a good impression. So she buys an awesome outfit and is all set, but when she gets to her school disaster after disaster happens. She is wearing the EXACT same outfit as another girl! To make things worse her tag-along friend (Rolland) won't leave her alone! The first day has been a disaster, and later in the week when she finally makes some friends they turn out to be boy crazy. After awhile things start to lookup for Roxanne, she gets a boyfriend and is finally fitting in! But then she has to make a major decision on what cool really is. To find out the problem and how she solves it read Definitely Cool.This book was ok. The beginning started off a little bit slow. Things started to pick up towards the end, and it got VERY interesting. This book is all about fitting in, which is probably what a lot of teenagers can relate too."
2,This book is unrealistic.,The language and actions of the kids and the parents are unrealistic. This book is a waste of time and money. The parents are too strict and the kids are trying too hard to be cool and fit in. School is nothing like this book has it.
2,okay - but not really for a beanbag,"These beads are super heavy and probably suitable if are making your own stuffed dolls, but not really any good for a beanbag chair, unless you bought a whole mes of them, and then your beanbag would be pretty darn heavy. The bag was smaller than a pillow you'd put on your bed, maybe a third of that size in volume, so it is not going to help fill anyone's beanbag, because if that's all the extra stuffing you need, you probably haven't even noticed yet."
3,Far-out man.,"It's a story we've all heard 100 times: good boy goes to bording school, boy meets stoner, stoner takes him to hippie concert, boy makes new friends, does numerous drugs, then sells drugs, hates his father and step-mother, spirals out of control, and ends up in rehab. I couldn't decide if this film was for drugs, or against. Maybe the pros/cons of the whole scene. Overall the films story was half jam-band parking lot life, and half the ups and downs of the boy Simon. Even though I could relate to some things, overall I felt the movie was kind of a buzz-kill. No bands were actually in ""Around The Fire"" either. And no great acting to be found. The only ""star"" here was really Tara Reid (pre-implants). Overall decent for those who attend shows, but it basically just reminded me of countless losers I've known (meaning those who didn't know when to say when). Peace."
4,Taking a look at reality,"This movie is about the upper middle class boy being introduced into a world of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll and his recovery from his addiction. A real subject I have seen myself. What is scary is this could be your son or daughter."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I heard this movie was really good. So I rented it because I go to alot of shows and know how the scene is. Well I popped it in and watched it, and I was really disappointed. First off the movie was pretty slow in some parts.... Another thing is yeah there's drugs there, but that's why you have to be smart and say no!! And it makes the scene look bad by centering the movie around acid!!!! Because there's not always that at shows, and now some dumb teenager is going to go to the shows because they watched Around the Fire and said ""Wow there's acid there!!!"" It's all about the music!!I gave this movie 2 stars because Devon is hot, and Tara Reid is pretty cool too. Other then that the movie was terrible."
5,this is a fun and great moive,Acouple of year ago i was on the set watching this moive being made. It was a lot of fun because the eara where they were filming was really was created into a deadhead consert seen. I have seen this moive about 5 time and i sitll watch it. This moive should have been bigger but there was not a lot of money for advertisement. So see biggest and the best independent film of a long time.
1,Are you serious?,"This movie is ridiculous! I hope people don't take this movie serious, because it in no way depicts what touring from show to show is like. This was a direct kick to the groin to any and all who like movies and enjoy really good music. By the way I loved the kids haircut in the movie, it was the most obnoxious mullet I have ever seen"
4,enjoyable film,I just watched this flick...might I add a great soundtrack and a nice fast moving story line. I thought is was a good movie overall and was glad i bought...being a phish head i have been to many shows and they have really duplicated the scene pretty well on the movie... anyways definitely check it out
4,very interesting,"I got this book for Christmas. I must say it is interesting. I agree with the other reviews, as it was a bit cumbersome to read at times. I guess that comes from the writing style, as the book was first published in the early 1900's. If your interested in the legend and myth of werewolves this book is priceless. It hasn't been watered down by tons of hollywood or mainstream info. The chapter that actually tells you how to become a werewolf was great. If I can find some raw opium and a wolf skin belt I'm in business!!"
4,Incredible!,"This volume is of incredible value from both an historical perspective and from a study of lycanthropy world-view as well. Comprehensive. I would highly recommend it to anyone delving into this fascinating behavioral syndrome and the history attached to it. Originally published in 1912 (I believe), you will find it heavy to read now and then but the insights gained are worth the effort. Not a ""neo-werewolf"" volume! Don't bother if you think Oz on Buffy the Vampire Slayer defines werewolves."
5,loved it,My firend loves werewolves so I got a book about them . Couldn't have picked a better book.Loved it wondefuly writen.
4,A fun 'old-school' toy,"The toy was shipped well, arrived undamaged and on time. We did not realize that it plays music when it rolls which is nice. The only issue that prevented it from recieving 5 stars is that we feel the cord holding the stick is too short. If the cord was only 4 to 6 inches longer it would be easier for the child to use."
2,Order another xylophone,"This xylophone's cord which connects the stick is insanely short. So short that it makes the playing the end notes impossible. The manufacturer never tried to actually use this thing. Plus it's overpriced for what it is, better alternatives out there."
4,"Helped me, maybe you too","I found the AP US History Review book very helpful. The review was especially helpful - it was clear and concise. And the practice exams - ""forget-about-it."" The trick is that you have to already know what you are studying before you use the book because afterall, the book is just a review. It should only remind you of what you already know. The book is just brief enough to not cloud your mind and confuse you and is just comprehensive enough to get you everything you need to know. All said and done, I would definately recommend this book to anyone who wants to pass the exam, but beware, you must study too."
5,5 stars for the score of 5!!!,"This book definately helped me for the May 2000 exam. It had the compressed version of all the text. It discussed the important topics that were divided into three parts: Politics, Economic, and Social & Culture. The book has 6 tests that were a good practice , and each question has an explanation. The DBQs are also included with sample essays. It is a great method of review. I got the book about 3-4 weeks before the test date and just read and took the tests. I relied on this book and my basic knowledge of history. It is a great test prep book. Cons: there are some typos in the answer key. but if youre sharp youll pick them up and thatll show that you know your stuff!! Another con is that the book doesnt have that many techniques, but the pros outweigh the cons. If it wasnt for this test prep, i wouldnt have gotten a 5 on the exam."
3,Not the best test prep book,"This book is ok, but it had some historical mistakes in the historical facts. Most of the facts that were messed up were ones about woman and sexuality in the 1900s. Other than that the book turned out to be average because when I took the test, the book seemed to give a confidence of knowing the information behind the questions."
3,A decent one for noob,"The book is filled with informations, including unnecesary ones. There practice exams don't reflect the actual exams in anyway. There is no visual aid in the book. It is poorly organized chroniclly."
4,"Great book, but you might want more","This book was great, it covered everything on the AP exam, but the practice tests were about half as hard as the actual AP test. If you really want to prepare, I would suggest you get this book and a second source."
5,Lindsey's Best,I think this is Johanna Lindsey's best book. I love Scottish novels and she wrote this so well. It reminds me a lot of a Julia Garwood book. You should definately read this book. I have read it atleast 4 times already.
4,warning - reissue!,"Please be aware that this book was an earlier book that is now being issued as hardback.It is a worthwhile read, but boy, do I get irritated with these older books released as hardback without disclosing the earlier copywrite date."
1,Worst yet...,"This was one of Lindsey's worst. I just wanted it to be over, and wanted both of the main characters to die just so it would end the torture. This book was basically so awful that the one redeeming quality that I can think of is that I didn't notice any spelling/grammar errors. That is the one positive point."
1,"She shoots, she misses...","I'm a huge JL fan...normally. However, this was a little painful to read through. I got so bored throughout the book and distracted with other things because it just wasn't a captivating read. The plot is very redundant and similar to many other JL books (I will say that I liked the Scottish setting), except this one didn't make the cut. I disliked the heroine because of her whinny and spineless attitude. It's understandable that she was supposed to be afraid of the hero, but really?? Could she have been a bigger baby?? I think the drama was a little over the top and the end extremely rushed. . Sorry to say, but I wouldn't waste the money on this book, just borrow it from the library if you have nothing else to read."
3,I did like the dialogue,I thought the best part of this story was the authentic dialogue. The story itself was a predictable.
3,...,"It was a nice book. I love Lindsey's writing style. The story was a bit slow to begin, though. They didn't even meet or talk to each for very long. And I didn't like it that Jamie's brother found her and brought her home. And then all the fear and the fighting... A typical Lindsey love-hate relationship."
2,Not the ending i wanted,"Reading this book, I felt sorry for Sheena and I wished that she could have someone better. Sheena almost dies because of Jamie's temper, and I was annoyed by how Jamie is angry after he believes that Sheena slept with Jameson. He wants his wife to be a virgin, but he's slept with many other women and has not married them. It was also annoying how every time Jamie touches Sheena, she gives in. I don't like that in this book or any other book, because this is the character's weakness, and I don't think that having a man touch a woman would make her will become the same as his in real life. Everytime Sheena is angry with Jamie, he touches her and she gives in. I would not recomend this book."
4,"a simple, but sweet love story",This novel has the most beautiful heroine and she makes the story shine! Another thing I like about this novel is that Jamie and Sheena are in the same age group. I only wish the book was longer. It would be interesting to see what these two characters are like in ten year's time. They both have such fiery tempers! I wish there were more fighting scenes because those are almost always the most fun.
3,Lacking salt and pepper!,"A gentle feuding is a nice story, likable enough to take you through a journey into the lowlands and highlands of Scotland with much ease. At some points the plot gets you so excited, you just go on and on to find out what will happen next, but that is all. The story is not as enchanting as it aspires to be, the heroes are easy to identify with but they don't charm you or draw you in. In short, I am not sorry that I bought this book and read it, it is really nice and well written, but you will feel that something is missing, maybe spunk, heat, intensity, depth..."
2,Horrible heroine,This book was very difficult for me because I found no redeeming qualities in Sheena. Was she feisty and willfully or was she a timid mouse afraid of the boogeyman man? Her anger and fear were so unjustified at every turn that I found myself hoping some horrible disaster would befall her. Disappointing because Lindsey has so many other wonderful books.
5,A Classic,Johanna Lindsey's book on highland feuds and intrigue is a classic. I first read in the 80s/90s and always compare highland stories to it. A lusty laird and a headstrong girl both with tempers lead us through the gamut of emotions. Can't wait to read again.
2,Lynne Cheney's a whiney academic herself.,"This book is written for a general public that is assumed to know nothing about academia & the world of scholarly ""research."" Ms. Cheney apparently would like to keep it that way. Cheney's book is a celebrity ""quote-off,"" pitting statements by academics & scholars she admires against those she does not. Two stars because at about the middle of the book, Cheney, perhaps accidently, distinguishes between Marxism & the latter-day Marxist ideologues. Too bad she couldn't've made the same point about postmodernism & postmodernist ideologues. Like the people & the ideas she condemns, Cheney apparently believes that the battle over values can be fought only at universities & affiliated ""think tanks."" Boy, talk about elitist!"
1,Party Line,"Got it! Radical Feminism, bad. Multiculturalism, bad. Afrocentrism, bad. Queer Theory, bad. Academics, BAD. Its funny how people of Lynne Cheney's extreme political persuasion are so stuck on that what's-wrong-with-our-culture and what-happened-to-our-values? talk. They are soooo fixated on education and children. It's almost like some sort of perverted fetish. Maybe she needs to start one of those nationwide youth clubs. That way she can put her race theories into practice."
3,Damaged,The book was damaged when I received it. It has yellow paper stuck to the cover that appears to have been there before it was shipped.
2,Not a Super Deal......,After a week inside of the wheel well I checked and all that remained was the magnet no boxInsufficient glue on the magnet to the plastic body
3,A Reprint of Win 98 Book ? ?,"This book seems to have too many references & tips that were applicable in Win 98 but are not applicable in Win ME. This results in the problem that you can't tell which of the tips in the book are valid. The book makes numerous references to using TweakUI to enhance some parts of your system, yet TweakUI does not seem to be a part of Win ME as it was with Win 98. TweakUI does not appear in the pre-loaded software on a new PC, nor is it on the backup CD. The book offers many other tips that probably were applicable to Win 98 but do not work in Win ME (or require going thru different screens to get to the correct result). Methinks this book was a quickly modified version of the Win 98 book that was rushed into print to take advantage of a new audience."
5,2 Years and Still Holding Up!,"This car seat bag is amazing. I am able to travel through the airport with a toddler, a large check only bag, a checked toiletry bag, a stroller, diaper bag and purse. I have a method and I make look silly but I manage without hurting myself or exerting a crazy amount of energy. We have checked the bag, with a Britax convertible car seat inside, over 75 times and it is still holding up. One of the straps is starting to disconnect from the top of the bag but only a little. I will just take a heavy duty needle and thread to it!"
5,Great bag,Have taken it on 3 roundtrip flights already and it has held up well. It fits both my Graco Snugride 35 & my Britax Boulevard (not at the same time of course). I love that I can throw a few extra things in the bag (like all those diapers you need while traveling!) & check it in. :) The hubby says it isn't the most comfortable backpack to carry (with the Graco inside) but it also isn't uncomfortable. I find that it is most comfortable if you adjust the straps so that the bottom sits right against your lower back/pelvis area. No complaints so far with this bag.
2,The bag broke on the first use,"We bought this for a trip to the Caribbean to hold our daughter's car seat. It held up fine on the way there but on the way back it burst at the zipper. When we went to baggage claim, the empty bag came out first with baggage tag then our car seat came out several minutes later. I'm surprised we got both back. I returned this to Amazon for a refund. It is a shame since it seemed like a very well constructed bag with heavy duty zippers and material. It may just be that we got a defective bag. I may try another one in the future (maybe they'll improve the zipper issue or I'll get a non-defective one)."
4,a little tight around a britax marathon,"we have a britax marathon 70 and this bag is surprisingly tight around the sides. we filled the seat with other items as recommended by others, used it on a trip successfully but signs of slight rips on top flap already. good bag for the price"
3,Great bag but doesn't last,Great bag! Fits perfect and lots of extra room for other things. Ive put my kids little duffle bag in or in the winter well stuff our coats in so they're easily accessible when we get off the plane. I really like this bag but it is really bulky. It took me some time to master the balancing act. If u bend forward you can easily topple over (I'm 5'1) but I didn't think it was that heavy and the straps are comfortable. Only complaint is that after a few trips on the plane it's already starting to rip at one of the seams :(
3,Disappointed product,"Bought it thinking it would replace my ""one step ahead"" one. It looked great but the bottom didn't hold up well at all for the first use from BOS to SJC. In addition, it looked BIG but mine almost didn't fit."
4,sturdy,This bag has done well so far. I gave it four stars only because we've only had to use it once. So I am not sure how it will hold up over time.
5,Very Helpful,"I traveled alone with my 3 month old and used this over christmas. It was AMAZING. I was able to check it and put lots of diapers and my Pump in Style and extra clothes and christmas presents in it (and to check a ""car seat"" is free). I would highly recommend this."
1,Durable? Not hardly,"First trip with bag, the seam ripped at the top by the handle all the way across. Returned and Amazon was good enough to give a full refund."
3,Great idea but not very sturdy,"I've just returned from a trip to Europe on which I used this bag to carry a Graco high-back booster seat. It was used on a total of six flights and got progressively more ripped on each stage of the journey. It now has five rips in it, three of which go all the way through to the interior. Childress say that they guarantee their products 100%; however, damage caused by airlines is not covered. Well really, what damage are you going to have inflicted on a travel car seat bag except damage caused by airlines? Childress need to use a much sturdier, rip-resistant material so that this product is actually fit for purpose. I doubt whether we will be able to use this on more than a couple more trips due to the damage it has already undergone.This bag is a great idea, but it could be so much better..."
3,"AWESOME, except zipper quality!","I was so excited to receive this, and ignoring other reviews on quality I decided to purchase this for our Britax. I put the car seat in and tried to zip up the bag. The zipper track was broken. I used no force and not sure if this was shipped to me like this or if it was so fragile that it broke with me just putting car seat in. The bag itself is great, good quality. The zipper is cheap-ish and probably needs a better zipper to endure the stress of the bag."
5,Great Purchase,"I just got home from a trip with two layovers with my 1year old's Britax car seat. The Travel Bag was a lifesaver. It's a little awkward since it is so big, but it really worked well. I was able to carry the car seat everywhere much easier than any other way. We used her car seat on the flight, and the bag was easily packed and unpacked in the plane with the large Britax Seat. The bag looks like it would hold up for checked bags too, but the zipper seems a little weak. It didn't break on my trip, but I'm sure they will be the first thing to break.On another note, the majority of the air line people didn't' realize what the bag was for, and continued to push me to check or gate check it, but if you are persistent, they let you bring on to strap your child in for a flight."
4,Great for the airport!,"We got this for our Graco Snugride 32 carseat. The seat and base fit in it very easily. The bag was really helpful for our trip. The backpack-style shoulder straps mean the carseat is one less thing you have to carry, which is a huge help when traveling with a baby! I do wish it had a little more protective padding, but overall, this was a great purchase!!!"
5,Great Travel Bag,"This is a great travel bag for carseats. We have used it a few times, and it makes travelling through airports a breeze. You can carry it like a backpack. It is nicely padded, and you can put a few extra items into the bag (lightweight) and check for free! It even fits the larger carseats. We have a Britax and a Recaro - and this fits them both."
3,serves it's purpose,"This bag was just what we needed to bring our baby's carseat and base on our plane trip across the country. It has some padding, which is a little peace of mind considering how much carseats cost and how they're handled by luggage carriers. the reason for the 3 stars is that when we went to pull on the top handle to get it off a shuttle bus luggage rack, the material tore, so from that point on we had to use the backpack straps to carry it whether we were wearing it or not (which really wasn't bad at all). But other than the lack of reenforced material at the handle point, this bag is roomy enough we fit both carrier and base, and a portable high chair for the trip in it, and it held up to all the airline guys could dish out (it only ripped when WE pulled on it).....Good bag!"
1,Immediately broke,"First time using the bag, the zipper tore apart. Even if we get the zipper to close, it rips open with the slightest pressure."
3,Can't use it through to the airplane!,"So this was a GREAT idea, until I had to take it through security. It doesn't fit in the xray machine, so I had to remove the seat from the bag, while holding my one year old and all of our stuff. NOT easy. It's also a HUGE pain in the butt to get down the aisle of the airplane. If you are planning to fly with your carseat? Don't use it. The padding is great for keeping the carseat safe when checking bags, but TERRIBLE for allowing it to fit in tight spaces."
1,Does not fit Evenflo Symphony,"We purchased this to make carrying the car seat while flying easier. While the bag is huge (wide, and very tall), the top portion was not deep enough to fit the headrest of the car seat. We tried everything, but could not even get the bag zipped up over the car seat. Had to return it."
3,Ripped on 1st Flight,"The JL Childress Ultimate Car Seat Travel Bag did its job; our car seat made it without damage. However, there were 2 small rips in the bottom of the travel bag after its first flight, but the travel bag did protect the car seat. It was also a tight fit on the Evenflo Triumph but the travel bag did zip up."
3,Its just alright...,"This bag is alright, not great, not bad. We've had it now a year, and only used it twice. Once on a flight, the other on Megabus. After the second use it has a tear from using the top handle to lift it. The top fabric actually pulled from the inner fabric and is now torn at the seam. Still can use, but still disappointing. One of the straps is also pulling away from the pack at the lower point. Again still can use, but I'm not looking forward to when it snaps on us while we're traveling. These damages are from us lugging them around NYC via public transit."
1,Broken zipper,What an amazing product idea! Too bad the zipper broke within the 1st hour we used it. Not sure if exchanging it will result in a better zipper as it seems poor quality
5,Exactly what we need,We brought our Graco My Ride 65 Convertible Car Seat on our trip and it fits this travel bag perfectly. The car seat is in the same condition when we arrived to our destination and on our flight back. It has adequate padding and the back pack style of carrying it is really convenient especially with a little child.
4,Great bag!,We just bought this bag for our upcoming vacation so we haven't yet traveled with it BUT it seems great. We have the Britax Marathon and it this bag fits it perfectly. The bag and zippers seem durable and the backpack straps are relatively comfortable.
3,JL Childress Car Seat Bag,"This is a great item if you need to protect your car seat when travelling. It's very big and I can confirm it fits the Orbit Baby G2 Infant Car Seat w/base. Now I'm disappointed that on the flight back home, there was some damage to the zipper. I didn't notice it till I was flying another time. This limited me to the use of only one side of the zipper. The bag held up for our flight back home but after that I couldn't zip it back up. So this lasted me for a total of 6 flights. I purchased another bag because I have faith that it will hold up better. I will update."
4,J Childress Ultmate car seat travel bag review,"Good product. We used it on one round trip (with connecting flight). Our chicco keyfit 30 car seat and base fit in the bag with no problems. The back pack straps were useful adn functional. The bag does look beat up after the trip, but I'm sure the baggage handlers were tossing it around without caution. There are no tears or rips so far. I have no complaints with this product. It performed as i hoped and fit our carseat/base which was my biggest concern since I couldn't find any reviews about car seat bags for the keyfit 30."
5,Excellent Product,"We just used this travel bag for the first time last weekend and it worked wonderfully! Prior to this trip we have taken the Britax carseat on board for our son, who is 2, and used the gogo Kidz travelmate to wheel it thru the airport. However, our son is 38"" long and his feet rest on the seat in front of him, so we decided to try him in his own seat with a CARES restraint, which worked out much better!! However, that ment checking his carseat, and we wanted to make sure it didn't get damaged, so we purchased this bag. The backpack feature made the normally cumbersome carseat VERY easy to manage, and the carseat arrived perfectly both times. The material appears to be very durable, but I can't really speak to that because we have had the bag for such a short amount of time. I would highly recommend purchasing this product if you are going to be traveling with the carseat as a checked item!"
4,"Good quality, awkward to carry.","I purchased the ""backpack"" version of this bag after reading the reviews that the wheels on the rolling version broke easily. After using it for the first time, I somewhat wished I'd gone with the rolling one.This bag is sturdy with quality fabric and a surprisingly good amount of padding. We used it with a Graco Snugride on one trip, and it left room to pack a whole other bag inside. It will clearly fit a larger, full-size car seat. We felt confident gate-checking the car seat being it was so well protected.This bag is HUGE and awkward to carry through an airport. You have to constantly be making sure you aren't whacking someone with it as you turn, and you kind of have to wonder how silly you look. You also can't fit the car seat through the x-ray machine in it - at least not in the airports we were in."
3,Pretty Good,"We ordered 2 of these to bring on our trip recently. Of the 2, one made it through without damage. The other was damaged on our first leg of the trip. When we got it from baggage claim, they had inspected both seats. One was fine, the other had a broken zipper. I'm sure it has something to do with the inspection people not being very gentle, but to have 2 brand new bags and one gets broken on our first use - kind of upsetting. We still had to use it to come back home.They are WAY better than the other kind of bag we'd used in the past though. Way more protection, and much nicer design. I would still say this was a good purchase for us."
3,Nice cover but DOESNT fit Britax Advocate,This was a very protective car seat but it does not fit Britax Advocate car seat. They were very helpful about accepting the returned item though.
5,Genius!,"I had talked to a friend about this product and that was as far it went. But then, I was sitting at the computer one day clicking around Amazon and thought, 'I'm going on a trip, just myself and my son, I really need to streamline our baggage especially when we are flying back and forth from overseas.' As anyone with an 18-month old can attest, one does not travel lightly. I found the car seat travel bag, and thought I'd give it a try. I just received it in the mail, put the car seat in it to make sure it fit (the seat and on my back)-- sure does!! Now I only ask myself, 'why I didn't I buy this six months ago when we transitioned to a forward facing car seat?!?!?!? Thanks for this awesome product!!!"
5,Fantastic!,"This thing was great for our last minute cross-country vacation. Not only did the airline we were flying on not charge to check anything associated with children under two, but there was plenty of room for the car seat, and a bunch of extra items we just couldn't jam into our luggage. Was a little bit awkward carying it on my back, but the seat made it there and home in perfect condition."
5,only way to travel with a carseat,"I bought this bag to travel alone with my son last month. I have previously traveled alone with him, but always had someone meeting me to help with all my luggage and gear, this time I did not. I would not have made it without this bag! Like other reviewers stated you are also able to throw in a few extra items since the car seat is going for free anyway, which was great! This fit my Peg Perego convertible seat just fine and it made getting through the airport alone possible! I would highly recommend this bag even if you aren't traveling alone, the ability to put the car-seat on your back is just wonderful!"
2,Very cheap material - not durable,"After 1 flight there was a tear near the seam on the bottom. I don't expect I'll get more than a few uses out of them (I bought 2). Also, the positioning of the handle on the top makes it difficult to lug more than one bag. The shoulder straps are nice, however if you are only carrying 1."
5,Keep your car seat safe,This is a great bag. Easy to carry as a back-pack and kept our car seat in perfect condition during the flight.
4,Great bag to protect the seat.,"This bag worked very well to protect the seat (and to pack some extra baby stuff in.) The straps make it convenient and easy to carry. The backpack is not comfortable to carry for a long period of time. I found myself putting it down almost every chance I got. I highly recommend this bag to use to check your seat for travel, but not to carry to the gate. Car to ticket counter is fine, but much further than that and it would be quite uncomfortable."
4,Graco Nautilus 3-in-1,i was scared that our Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 would not fit .. it did and still have room cant wait to take it on the plane .. i rated it 4 n not 5 cause i have not tried it out yet.. but i put a picture of my husband with the bag
4,GREAT BAG- NOT SO GREAT ZIPPER!,"This bag has been very handy.Love that its padded, to keep our $300 car seat safe.The drawback is a crappy zipper.We probably got our money's worth though, since we have used it for about 10 trips.I tried to get the zipper repaired, but they said it would cost $50.I guess it's time to buy a new bag.I am looking for one with wheels AND padding."
2,Doesn't fit Recaro Pro Sport Car seat,This looked like a sturdy enough bag so was very disappointed to find that it didn't fit the Recaro Pro Sport Harness to Booster seat. The website stated that the bag fit the seat but the actual packaging on the bag didn't mention Recaro.
5,worked for Graco My Ride 65,"Used it for one round-trip plane ride so far. A bit snug, but zipped shut fine! And I was able to also pack it with a bunch of toys and such to leave more room in our suitcase we were sharing! Wasn't damaged at all... so far! Oh and we traveled alone, my daughter and I... I was able to wear this on my back with the huge convertible car seat, daughter in a carrier on my front, and rolled the suitcase with folded umbrella stroller sitting on top and backpack attached to the retractable handle, so had a hand FREE to check in!"
1,Horrible Construction,"My husband and I just finished our second trip using this bag. We bought it to protect our Chicco infant seat so we had plenty of room to spare as it also fits larger convertible seats. Well, not only did the zipper break on this trip but one of the straps broke off while my husband was carrying it through the airport. We have barely used it and it is already completely useless. Please don't waste your money on this one, research some other brands."
4,Worth it,"I flip flopped about whether or not we needed a carrier for our car seat for soooo long. Mostly this was because many options are expensive. After seeing many other positive reviews, we took a chance on this Ultimate Car Seat Travel Bag. We'd planned to rent one through our car rental company for a recent trip, but for a 3 day trip, this bag was cost neutral. It just barely holds our Britax Marathon, and I can see how the seams would rip on the upper sides if the bag was tossed around some. It seems that this would only be an issue with larger car seats.Otherwise, the carrier is surprisingly comfortable to carry. Definitely worth having."
1,Should have spent more,"The quality of this is absolutely horrible. Had to throw out after 1 trip, it ripped right up the seams on the side. Wish it would have worked. We have a britax advocate."
4,Serves it purpose well,"Ordered two of these for a family move and we needed to take 2 car seats with us. Seemed like the perfect solution. These carries come packed in a zippered, reusable storage bag. Found them really easy to use; place the car seat in the bag and put the padding in the right spot. The back-pack straps were great because it was easy to throw on and wrangle the kids and the other luggage. They sell some with roller wheels, but depending on how much luggage you have, it may not be worth it. 1600 miles later, our car seats arrived un-damaged.Taking off 1-start because I wish it was a little bit bigger. It was a tight fight for our forward-facing booster seat.I would recommend this product."
5,Highly durable. Well worth its price,"Our Ultimate bag has survived multiple trans-Atlantic flights and 6+ Caribbean/European/US domestic flights per year since 2004 (it's now Aug. 2008). It has a few rips which are completely the fault of the airline (one looks like an actual knife cut it), which I've mended with duct tape, and still it keeps going. I absolutely cannot recommend it enough for its durability. By comparison, we purchased a 'cheap' alternative last year for our 2nd child. That thing was absolutely destroyed in one single trip overseas. The Ultimate Travel Bag is head and shoulders above its competition. I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY ENOUGH. If you want something with wheels - I see that's an alternate model now. I would warn, however, the ""other"" bag we bought, it had wheels - and those were the first things the airlines popped off."
4,IT FITS BRITAX ADVOCATE CS TOO!!!,While we have not yet been able to travel with it...that is still a few weeks away. We really like the sturdy material and padding. The biggest plus we found is that it still fits the Britax Advocate CS car seat...which is a few inches wider than most because of the side impact protection. I wanted to make sure that other people who may have the advocate CS saw this info. I'll update my review after I travel with it.
1,zipper broke during first use,I will be returning this because the first time we attempted to take it on vacation the zipper broke in the airport- nice start to the vacationSInce the entire point of the bag goes away with a broken zipper I can only give it 1 star
4,good,Britax Advocate 70 cs owners do not buy it does NOT fit no matter how hard you try!!!! do not buy if you have a Britax other wise made really well.
1,Do not waste your time.,This bag has a bad design and the zipper is cheap. It will rip open.The bag did not make it through a single trip (only 1 layover).
1,Terrible,We are returning this car seat travel bag. The zipper broke during the first leg of the trip. I just happened to be sitting by the wing of the plane watching them load luggage and saw our car seat sticking out of this bag with a broken zipper. Then I had to worry for the rest of the trip if the car seat would make it to the our final destination as we had a lay over and transfer. Not cool! FYI- The airline was unable or unwilling to alert the luggage carriers when I spoke to the customer service rep during the layover. This product was too expensive for this kind of stress!
3,Not as well-made as I'd have hoped.,"The item arrived in a timely manner, was as advertised, but the construction of the item isn't as high quality as I'd have hoped. One trip out and back thru the airport was all it took for the bag to have stray threads poking out all around the edges. I doubt highly that this would make it through more than 3 trips total, without falling apart completely. All-in-all, it did the job we asked, for the price, but will need to be replaced probably annually due to use. I might look for something a bit more rugged next time."
3,A well-designed bag except for the zipper,"The first bag I received had a defective zipper. I didn't realize until I got to the airport and the zipper kept splitting so that the bag was essentially open when I got my seat back on the baggage carousel. Amazon allowed me to exchange the defective one for a new bag and it doesn't appear to have the same problem.I still recommend the bag, but order it well before your trip in case you get one with a bad zipper.Things I liked about the bag: fit my Safety 1st convertible seat well, comfortable to wear, padded and adjustable shoulder straps, and flaps at the top that you can tuck the car seat sides under."
3,Great product,"This really is a nice product. It protects your baby's car seat from all the grime that comes from checking things in planes. However, the zipper broke on our first trip and we had to manage this for the return flight, which was a pain. Luckily, Amazon has a great exchange policy and we were able to swap it out. We'll see how long the zipper lasts on the new one."
4,Does exactly what it's supposed to do,"I was worried that the straps would get torn off in travel, but they survived a trip to Europe and back just fine and we didn't even gate-check it. It was as comfortable as you could expect a giant bag to be on your back and was much easier to deal with making train and tram connections than another roller bag would be (We already had two medium-sized suitcases we were lugging around). Our Britax Boulevard (same size as a Marathon I think) fit fine, but another inch or two taller and it would have been a stretch. The padding protected the seat well, although the interior lining got a small tear where the hard plastic base of the seat pushed against the soft bottom padding."
4,Mental Disorder presents,"This is a cool compilation from the legendary Mental Disorder label, UK. Originally released as a vinyl LP, this CD completed with bonus tracks. Nice bands, like Frantic Flintstones, Nitros, Cellmates and Red Hot Cadillacs. Many songs are exclusive for this album, so if you're a real Psychobilly fan like I do - this is for you."
3,Listenable and satisfying.,"Time is a pretty good album from Mercyful Fate. The musical direction of the disc is hard rock with a gothic atmosphere. There's a total of eleven tracks, and I find all of them to be listenable and energetic. The musicianship is proficient, and the songwriting and production are good. King Diamond does a cool job with the vocal duties. He is a distinctive, dramatic, and versatile vocalist. The guitar playing is tight, and there are some nice riffs and solos throughout. The songs that I like the most are ""Nightmare Be Thy Name,"" ""Angel of Light,"" and ""Witches' Dance."" ""Nightmare Be Thy Name"" sports a cool guitar riff. The CD booklet contains individual photos of the bandmembers and the lyrics to the songs, too. Time is an album from Mercyful Fate that I don't mind listening to. Worth a listen."
4,Minutes and seconds are passing us by......,"This is Mercyful Fate through and through. Although some tend to argue that the original two albums are ""the best"" and ""Time"" is just another filler. I am on the opposite side of the spectrum there. I believe this is a great MF record. Not only have they shown that they are maturing musically, but the massive satanic tones from ""Don't Break The Oath"" and ""Melissa"" are almost gone. This gives way to a creepier, more haunting atmosphere to the music and less satan b.s. Every song on this album is great and deserves a listen. This album is good for both those familiar with MF and to those new to this extraordinary band."
4,"Excellent guitars, good production, not as many hooks","This album has better production than the older, classic, Mercyful Fate stuff. The original guitarists play on here, and they lay down some great riffs. King Diamond is King Diamond -- not too much else to say, there, other than he seems a bit more restrained on this album than is typical, especially when compared to his solo stuff.While the guitar riffs are strong, the songwriting and composition isn't quite as good as the older stuff, with a couple of notable exceptions (The Mad Arab, The Preacher). Great guitars go a long way for me, though, and there's a lot of good metal guitar work on this album."
2,Has Some Moments.,"This album sounds just about the same as In the Shadows. There's a little more experimentation on this release though. The intro to ""The Mad Arab"" is different. This isn't a bad album in places, but it doesn't really offer anything new. The musicianship is good as usual, it's just that the songs aren't very enthralling. I actually give this two-and-a-half stars."
3,Try seeing the DVD before you review it.,"The process of reviewing a DVD is simple, and it requires you actually see it before you review it. Duh. Three reviews have been posted in here before it was even released! Review on product, not anticipation... There are plenty of DVDs released these days that simply look and sound worse than the VHS. Of course I hope this is not the case with this partiular release."
4,The last concert of a great band,"On Halloween in 1995, one of the greatest bands I've ever known played their last concert. And here, in all its glory, you can watch it on DVD. Not only that, but you also get a bonus DVD filled with goodies like backstage interviews and even hidden videos (I have found that pressing the 4 button on the number pad is useful ;)).Of course, if you would prefer experiencing the concert in your car's stereo system, there's also the audio CD. But beware, it's missing ""Just Another Day,"" which they gave a stunning performance of."
3,So-So,"It was about time they put a Boingo item out on DVD, but they could have done alot better. The sound is kinda weak, 'Insanity' would sound so much better with BOOMING bass out of the subwoofer. And yes it is pretty much exactly like the VHS copy, but hey, I bought it anyhow. Hopefully a COMPLETE video collection will soon follow, with remastered sound & picture, plus commentary. But for now, this DVD will have to do. Show the the BIG companies BOINGO merchandise still sells well! SUPPORT BOINGO, show them we want more! Buy it today, you know you want too!"
2,Best Concert Ever - Bad DVD,"Why, oh why couldn't this DVD be given anything more? The sound isn't even remixed for the disc. I'm a true fan of the band with tattoos to prove it, but this DVD doesn't justify purchase unless your VHS copy is, like mine - worn out.Please let there be another version later - Danny Elfman isn't new to the world of DVD. He should see that this one is done again and done right."
4,worth it,"I would say that if you buy this set, just the performance of ""Grey Matter"" alone is worth the price. ""Who Do You Want to Be Today?"" is alot of fun too. It's great to see these guys out there running around so much...I can't keep up! haha The little extras of the Mystic Knights are fun, and the 2 videos at the end are cool too. Get ready to dance!"
1,Very Disapopinted!,"I received this product and payed for it as it was advertised as a New Conditioned DVD. Not the Used price,but new. It was not in new condition,It had scratched marks on it!! Try to play it but it stops between the movie. I have never bought anything from Amazon before and probably won't again after this. I don't like to throw my money away. Sighed,Very Disappointed."
4,Great concert video,"This was an amazing concert!. I saw it in Vegas, this one was filmed in California. Great way to remember or experience for the first time. You MUST Max the volume to really immerse yourself!! :)"
3,Okay book.,"It was okay, a nice light read. Not as good as Lowell's books usually are. I had to read it off my computer though as I could not get it downloaded onto my Kindle HD!!"
1,Very Old Elizabeth Lowell Book,"I bought this, as it was an early publication of Elizabeth Lowell.The characters were one-dimensional and inspired no emotional involvement of this reader.Unless you are an avid Elizabeth Lowell, Ann Maxwell, A.E. Maxwell fan, I do not recommend you purchase this book."
4,A good start,"This book is great for anyone looking for a starting point for historical and geographical information on the railroads of northern New England. Maps of each railroad (as well as certain regions) featured in this book make it easy to locate where a railroad was located, what cities it connected, among other things. I highly recommend this book for model railroaders and railfans, as well as anybody just interested in general history of the New England region."
3,Great Show,This is a must for all car fanatics.A great series to watch by yourself or with friends.I highly recomend this as you will not be disapointed.
1,Great the first two times,"The show is basically always the same. Oh wait, thats the point. How do we know some kid doesnt go to a junkyard, buy a $100 piece of crap, makes a video, and get it remade on this show? Xzbit is just anther rapper who doesnt make it in the buisness, thanks to it being over crowded with lesser talent. Its kind of stupid to think, the car just sitting alone in the drive way, a camera crew on a street that is not busy, surrounded by houses, no one around, as Xzbit looks at your car. Where is the person? standing in there house? The show is preplanned, and the reactions are just faked abit. I know im over doing this, but if you had your car pimped like they do- think of how much it would cost to insure the car. The payment would sky rocket, and people who have it redone are poor it seems."
2,Not Worthy,"This deserves DVD treatment? First of all, I object to the term ""pimp"" being used as a verb. It's just not right. Some of what they do with the cars is amazing...but I wonder why they don't just get better cars to work with. If you rebuild an old piece of junk, you could get problems down the road. For all it must cost to redo the cars, they may as well just buy new ones (I suspect they do anyway, as some of the ""improvements"" are too hard to believe).I miss the days when MTV played music videos."
3,"MTV, you unpimped my DVD","Five stars for the show itself, of course. It is great fun, packed with surprises, always outrageous, and full of good-feelings for helping the needy without condensation. Xzibit is a fantastic host, charasmatic and witty. Good quality sound and decent video (a little fuzzy, but no artifacts). I wish they had a seperate audio track without beeping out the swearing, but they keep it all clean. Quick and stylish interface. Three disks in three thin clear cases, which I really like.But I have to downgrade the score because MTV decided to front-load the disks with almost 10 minutes of *non-skippable* ads for their other lame shows. I don't find fat oafs with no dignity or bozos who enjoy getting hit in the crotch the slightest bit entertaining, and being forced to watch it it painful. Too bad I can't take this thing to West Coast Encoding to get it fixed."
3,"Beautiful, but charts hard to read","I love the photos in this book, which feature adults of all ages in lovely country gardens and estates. The sweater designs are beautiful and painterly, and the sweaters look really comfy.I've never knitted anything from this book, partly because some of the designs are very intricate and I feel like I would need a microscope to read the charts for those designs, even though most of them are full-page."
4,Brillian Knits,"Very inspirational knitting in this book. Be prepared to spend a wad on yarns as they call for many, many colors. Nice items, something for everyone."
4,I find myself drawn to this book again and again and again .,"David and Micki Colfax have succeeded in doing what some of us would love to do ... return to a lifestyle that while more challenging (physically and mentally) is often more rewarding ... the simple pride of being able to provide for one's self and family; giving to one's children the gift of unrestricted time and energy, taking time to answer their questions and involve them in what you are doing and teaching them that some things in this world are not always fair .... there are other things I could mention but will let you find for yourself. When I find myself needing to step back from the hustle and bustle we know and call life, I return to ""Hard Times In Paradise,"" to be reminded of what's really important."
4,return to glory,"Jay's solo stuff was starting to wear on me, so I can't tell you how happy I was to see Son Volt back together for this CD. I agree with one of the other reviewers that I too miss the Boquist Boys and Heidorn, but I still fine the music to be on the same level as the Straightaways CD.Can't wait for the tour!"
3,Good output from Farrar,"After splitting from Uncle Tupelo, Jay Farrar made a genius-level album in 1993's ""Trace"" and has spent the remainder of his career trying to make another one half as good. With ""Okema"", he's done that and no more. The music is powerful straight-ahead rock, a big improvement on Farrar's drab solo albums. Except for a few preachy rants against the American Right, Farrar's lyrics continue to be suspiciously vague and ""poetic"". The band probably is not as tight or as creative as the original Son Volt. Tupelo/Son Volt/Farrar fans will find plenty of strong evidence that Farrar is ""back"", but ""Okema"" still does not meet the insanely high standard of ""Trace""."
1,Decent but Marred by Copy Protection,"This is probably the best thing Jay Farrar has done since Trace. Unfortunately, I'm returning the disc due to the rediculous copy protection scheme employed on the disc. Some cd players will play it, some won't. I listen to most of my music on my ipod, but unfortunately trying to rip this disc to mp3 will not work. I buy hundreds of cd's a year, yet I'm treated like a criminal. Don't buy this disc!"
2,bland repetition from one of the best,Unfortunately this cd just doesn't come close to earlier son volt efforts. I have been a huge uncle tupelo/son volt/jay farrar fan from the beginning and I was elated to hear there would be a new son volt release. However jay just doesn't cut it on this one. The songs are bland and boring and many of them sound the same especially following son volt's masterpiece wide string tremolo (one of my favorite cd's ever) and Farrar's excellent solo cd's. If you could find a bad song on any other Son Volt cd it would be better than anything on this disc. I just hope there are better things to come. I will buy any new Farrar/Son Volt release either way but this one will collect dust on my shelf.
1,"Son Volt fan, but won't buy because of copy protection","stop reading if you've heard this before, I want my voice heard. I've been a fan of Jay's since Uncle Tupelo, and want to hear this CD. I won't, however, as it comes on a crippled faux-CD that won't copy to a high-fidelity or lossless codec for use on my home stereo system and my portable players.And no I won't just buy from itunes, because that's a low-fidelity and lossy codec. If I buy a CD, I have the right to encode it to any codec I choose. Son Volt's publisher has decided this shouldn't be so, so I'm voting with my dollars and my amazon comments. For shame."
3,"Great Music , Pretty Disappointing Format.","I really enjoyed the Okemah and the Melody of Riot. You will definately want to give ""Bandages & Scars,"" ""Ipecec,"" and ""Gramophone"" a listen.I would give the album itself 5 stars, but they saw fit to make the other side of the disk a DVD, which is cool, but my portable CD player, the cd in my car and my CD Rom at work will not play the CD side for some reason. Pretty disappointing."
2,"ever must we learn, ever must we learn...","First off, this is not Son Volt. There is no Boquist/Boquist/Heidorn. This is Jay and some hired hands, not Son Volt but Jay Volt. And as such, this sounds nothing like a Son Volt record. Why resurrect the name just to urinate on it with this slate of bland tuneless dreck? Even if this were a Farrar solo outing, it's easily his worst, worse even than the maudlin moping of Terroir Blues (another record i considered a disappointment.) I don't know what's going on with Jay, but he needs to pull together some tunes with some soul, not this sparkly, by-the-numbers, pop-rock garbage. Just 'cause you're name-checkin' Woody Guthrie and naming the album after his hometown doesn't mean you got the goods. This album manages to both meander and bore at the same time. What i'd give for that hat to be medicine, and for Jay to recover his songwriting ability."
4,Rock and Roll still alive,"This cd is a throw back for sure but a pleasant one. It's just great to hear a collection of rock songs. They don't write 'em like this anymore and I wish they did -- rock songs with hooks. The sound of the guitars gives an new energy to Jay's singing. I love the line ""shaking your own brand of rhyme"" in the song WHO. ""6 String Belief"" would have been a hit single if they still played songs like this on the radio."
5,Son Volt is BACK!!,The PERFECT remedy for the summertime blues. A MUST have... great stuff!! Jay has put together a fantastic new lineup to resurrect Son Volt. They sounded great when I saw them at the Ardvark in Fort Worth a few months ago and this CD captures their sound. The DVD side with the documentary and live footage is worth the price alone. It gives you a chance to get to know the band.
3,This isnt the Son Volt I know!!,"I'm sorry folks. I tried my best to love this cd.But I can not. Besides Jay being the only original member, Where is all that great pedal steel guitar? I'm getting old! But I'm not deaf yet. I waited 7 years for this. I think it's a Jay Farrar solo cd & they decided to use the Son Volt name to sell a few more copies. Let the flamers begin!! But if you can tell me that this rates right up there with the first 3 Son Volt cd's? Then I dont really think you are a Son Volt fan! I think you might be a huge Jay Farrar fan. (Thats great) But you are not a Son Volt fan. I just hope if I wait another 7 years, That I get something a little better then this. I'm sorry, but thats how I feel. Thanks to all."
1,VOLT No - DO NOT BUY IF YOU LIVE IN A DIGITAL AGE,I bought the CD off of Amazon. I was excited for it to come out but . . . it doesn't play on any of my music devices (all Apple laptops/iPods of various sizes). It plays on my colleagues car CD (I only have an ipod and tape deck in my ol' '97 SAAB). She seems quite happy with the CD. Son Volt now goes into the category of Starbucks - places to boycott.
1,obvious backfire,"so i bought this album when i was on a trip & my hotel room happened to have a cd player. i've always been a big fan of uncle tupelo & its offshoots, but i have been disappointed with the limp trajectory of son volt's efforts since trace. this album received strong reviews. and those reviews are correct: i loved the music & it stayed in my hotel cd player the entire week i was out of town. NOW, i'm back at home where my only listening device is my computer/iPod, and i can do nothing with this. i willbe returning it. such a sad, stupid waste."
1,It's the voice,"I don't know why Farrar changed his singing voice after WST, but it ain't working for him. In fact, it is downright annoying. Not only that but the high, whiny tone is affecting the songwriting, because it's getting weaker with each new album. Listen to him on pre-solo and that is the voice that made him a great singer."
3,Same old Jay,"While Tweedy continues to experiment and expand his musical horizons, Farrar seems mired in the same ol sound. Not that it's a bad sound--it's a good album, very listenable--but it's time to move on. At least there's no space junk."
4,One of the Best of '05,"I popped this record into the CD player expecting to hear ""alt.country."" What I got instead was something like a Neil Young and Crazy Horse record, in the very best way possible. The sting and bite and electric rumble of the guitars evokes the best of Crazy Horse, and Farrar's new Son Volt line-up has moved firmly to rock'n'roll terrotory. If they'd covered Young's ""When You Dance"" or ""Everybody Knows This is Nowhere,"" it would have made perfect sense.I don't apologize for invoking Neil Young, as I see several of the reviewers who got here before me do the same. Its just in the air.The crunchy sould of the guitars on O&TMOR; is just so rewarding, mixed right up front with great separation. I hope Son Volt continues in this vein.Plus, its got a good beat and you can dance to it."
3,Nicolet men's Pocket Watch Quartz Model NC-1778,"Appears to be cast metal, done in such a way as to look engraved, but still quite appealing. It's for those who want the fancy style of years gone by. For the price I don't see how anypne could complain. I just recieved this watch and can't say how it will perform over time. So far, I'm pleased. I didn't expect it to compete with expensive watches."
5,sims season 2,I bought this product because my daughters enjoy playing the sims. i get so much enjoyment seeing them create their families and learn about real life.
4,Sims 2 Seasons a Nice Addition,"I didn't purchase this expansion pack until Sims 3 had already been released because I haven't been playing Sims 2 for a while. The addition of weather and gardening to the world of Sims 2 has been fun to have, and I've been enjoying items like the bowling alley, the skating rinks and the greenhouses."
5,awe-inspiring add-on,"This had so much in it, the original should have included it. I like the penguin and gardening. Glad it was cheap here."
3,"Seasons, worth the money?","I was really looking forward to this particular EP. Maxis put a lot of hype on Seasons and made it seem as if this would be the EP to end all EPs. The fact is you can get through all four seasons in an hour and a half and if your Sims don't have a lot of money or skill (and you aren't into cheats) there isn't a lot to do. The new objects and gardening plots are really expensive and require a lot of time. Sims over-heat and freeze way too easily and the Simkids get taken away left and right. Overall the game was a little bit of a let-down and somewhat frustrating, I think it would be especially frustrating to someone new to the Sims 2. I felt like I needed to give Maxis some bonus points for all their hard work though. It took massive amounts of programming skills to get snow to fall on anything that might be outside, and they do have plants that grow better in the right seasons but maybe it would have been better if they hadn't made such a big deal about it."
5,Yey! Snow!,I am so happy to finally be able to use my holiday pack items within appropriate seasons. And the gardening is very fun.
5,"F-F-FUN, FREEZING, H-H-HOT!",WHAT AN IMAGINATION THE CREATORS OF THE SIMS 2 SEASONS HAVE! I KIND OF WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY LADIES WEAR A FUR-YES I SAID A FUR COAT.DID YOU GUYS KNOW THAT THE TODDLERS EAT SNOW! AWESOME. BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THEM OUT THERE TOO LONG!ANYWAY LIKE WITH ALL THE OTHER SIMS/SIMS 2 GAMES I'M HOOKED!
5,...WORTH IT!,"...the minute i found out that they were comming out with a game where you can ice skate/roller skate, make snowmen, fish, and other outdoors activities, I right away thought of The Sims Vacation. I thought that it might not be worth it, since Sims has already come out with a game like such.This game is completly different. I love being able to go outside and have myt sims do a little garden work, make snow angels and snow men, ice skate, and ect. This game I found to be completly different. This is deff a good buy and you should buy it right away."
4,Love it !,"Ok so I seriously never give anything a ""perfect"" score but this game is much fun. I enjoy the fishing (which I do MUCH better on the game than IRL)and the gardening during the warmer seasons.It is well worth the money spent if you are a SIMS fan!"
4,Much better than the last expansion pack!,"The Sims 2 franchise is back on track with this latest expansion pack that lets your Sims experience seasons, as well as the activities that go along with those seasons. My Sims are having great fun gardening (and eating the results!), playing in the snow, raking leaves, fishing, having water balloon fights, sliding into the pool on their brand new waterslide... The list goes on. There is a lot of new content in this game, and yet it doesn't slow down my computer like the Pets expansion pack did (I uninstalled Pets before installing Seasons, and the whole game runs more smoothly).There have been a few minor glitches, but all in all it has been a lot of fun. I'm addicted to my Sims again!"
3,Always Weather?,"I had very high hopes for this expansion pack, but it seems as if most of them were not met. I don't know if I am the only person that has problems with this, but there is always some kind of weather going on, and my sims are spending half thier day looking out the window.Also I think that summer should have been made so that there was no school. It seems like EA is dead-set on making it so that the sims kids HAVE to go to school. I liked the new interactions that came with this, but the penguin confused me. There is no point to it.While I think that this isn't the worst EP I have no idea why everyone says it is thier favorite. I personally don't like my kids getting up at one in the morning to look at the light shower.It is definetly worth getting, but I think there is too much hype about it especially because of the constant weather. There is never a day where I don't have to worry about getting my kids in the right attire for outside."
4,Nice addition,"A nice addition to a good product. I'm a little delayed in buying this particular expansion pack, but I don't regret doing so. Some interesting features such as farming/gardening."
2,Didn't operate completely,The game was fun except the seasons didn't change and it would only stay winter. Some stuff wrong but it was okish
4,Amazing,Adds a TON of new content like winter clothes and it allows u to become a plant sim lol u can also control the seasons XD Worth every cent i paid for it
4,Enjoy the weather,"I believe this is the best expansion pack EA has put out for the Sims 2, with a few reservations. I love the farming and fishing aspects, the different skill and relationship bonuses tied to each season, and the graphics. BUT - there is always a BUT - the season graphics can really slow down a system. My laptop is well above all the system requirements for Seasons, but when winter arrives, my system can barely handle the constant snowfall. Also, some aspects of Seasons build upon the previous expansion pack Open for Business; if you don't have OFB, the farming and fishing won't be as lucrative for your sim. Overall though, I highly recommend getting this expansion pack."
4,Sims 2 Seasons,It is great being able to make a snowman or rake leaves and play in them. I almost lost a person though when he went outside without coat!! This is a great addition to the Sims 2 collection.
4,i like it,"it adds a lot to the enviornment of the game, though not really to the actual game play like the university expansion or something like that. i like the new objects and occupations it comes with."
4,ITS RAINING SIMS HALLOLUJA,The Sims 2 seasons is the best expansion pack because it bring such new-never-before-seen-dimensions to the game play. It makes the sims even more realistc. Its the bomb! Get It!
4,Re-review,This game works great its fun to play. Got the neccessary stuff i needed. Nice product in working condition no damage to game.
5,Gifts,Arrived on time for birthday present. Didn't like the fact that it didn't come gift wrapped since it was a present but it arrived on time and the child loves it.
5,Seasons,I just got the game and I am going to try it out today! I CAN'T WAIT! YAY! Thanks so very much! Great prices by the way!
1,not reccomended,"waste of money, and it totally takes over your motivations plus majorly changes game play as your sims can now get sick!!and omg it takes forever to grow food to heal your sims!"
1,Not worth its price.,EA games/Maxis made a quick buck on this expansion pack. Theres not a lot there. Yes you get weather but its not that big of a deal it doesnt affect game play hardly at all its more just visual than anything else. Theres not a lot of new things in this pack either like previous ones. Id save my money and by bon voyage instead. If EA games/Maxis lowered the price by 10.00 it would be O.K. but at this price its just not worth it.
1,Sims 2 Installers are the worst,"Each time my daughter tried to install a Sims 2 expansion pack it consumed hours of my time... Sims 2 Seasons is no exception! After 3 install attempts which hung on the second CD, I thought I'd try to disable my anti-virus software (OneCare). Low and behold OneCare would not run! AGHHHHH!I ripped out the Sims 2 Seasons program files (the uninstaller didn't work, of course) and reinstalled OneCare. What a POS!"
5,Nice pen for the price,"I am glad that Amazon updated the picture of this pen. The picture of the pen on this page used to be of silver one and that tricked me into buying the pen. Honestly, I was very disappointed to see a dark blue pen in my package.However, the pen turned out to be a very good pen. It writes better than my $50 Cross. I was amazed how my handwriting looked so good with this pen. The only complaint is the ink dries up really slowly. So, make sure you get better ink when you buy this pen."
2,Not what I thought,"Because the title says prep protector I thought this was the clear gesso, it's not. Don't be fooled, it's regular white gesso."
2,Good article but deceptively short,"Advertised as a four page article, it is really one page with what amounts to a cover sheet, a page of advertising for other HBR articles and a blank page.A very short interview focused on -- Love your customers.Not really worth 4.50"
5,One of my 10 all-time favorite CDs,"Buy this CD! Not only are Harris and Hamilton masters of their respective instruments, they work beautifully together, handing off solos seamlessly. They play with exuberance on some cuts, melancholy on others. Wonderful style on every cut, and a wonderful variety of music. This CD is one of my all-time 10 favorite CDs, and the title is very appropriate. Very enjoyable listening, and you won't regret buying it - I promise!"
3,This has turned out to be a very meaningful cd,"This cd has really become a favorite of mine. It is a meaningful and significant cd.The idea of Scott and Gene together on a project is mind boggling.Until this cd, I had never had the opportunity to hear Gene play. I must confess that Gene has won me over with his sound on the ivories. I plan to buy some of his product in the future.This cd offers a star studded band. The band seems to play together real well and seems to be having a lot of fun in the process.This cd offers a good repertoire. I like most of the songs offered here.Recommendation: I would like to recommend this cd."
3,Floats up,"I bought this one to replace an existing vacuum head that broke. Unfortunately this product is listed to be with ""covered weights"" but is so light that the vacuum head floats up in the pool when trying to vacuum the base. It consequently misses a lot of dust/leaves at the bottom. If you have a big concrete pool you are better of buying some other heavier pool vacuum head."
1,Don't buy TVs online,"I ordered a TV/VCR/DVD combo online. It arrived quickly, however, once I opened it I found that : a. it was used b. it was damaged/brokenI did return it for a full refund but I'd advise against making TV purchases online."
4,Long but thorough history of Irish leader,"Tim Pat Coogan compiles a sober and thorough history of Eamon deValera, the most influential Irish leader of the twentieth century. Combining painstaking research with first-hand accounts, Coogan presents a well-rounded portrait of this most complicated and controversial figure. Those who hold deValera in a saintly reverence may be angered at some of the less flattering depictions of the ""lay cardinal."" But this ranks as a most important read for anyone interested in tracking the course of twentieth century Ireland."
1,Don't do it!,"I wish there were negative stars for a review. This book was written in the 'dark ages' of horsemanship. I've ridden all my life and been taking natural horsemanship clinics since 1990, there isn't one good idea in this book. Save your money!!"
4,What a talent,"I just adore Judy Holiday! As an actress, she was magic. As a singer she is just as magical. True, she doesn't have an amazing range, but she has the ability to sell a song.This album is such a find, along with the even better ""Trouble is a Man"". I just LOVE her version of ""Lazy"" and ""What's the Rush"" is such a clever sweet tune.Do yourself a favor and pick up this CD...as well as ""Trouble is a Man"", and see for yourslef what a truly gifted song stylist she was."
1,POO-POO!,All tabloid garbage. This is the one Mick tried to stop publication. Alot of Anderson's claims are seriously waaay out there! Mick bit off a piece of his tongue in a high school basketball game forever changing his voice? Before becoming famous pop-singer Madonna was a Stones groupie?? As a teenager Mick lost his virginity to a sexy hospital nurse?? Anderson's 'source notes' do not provide specific substantiation to any of his claims. Even the baby photo of Mick is really a baby photo of Charlie!! Now i seriously doubt he would be able to get his text right if he can't even get a photo right?!! Come on now!
1,Snore zzzzz,"I have but a few words to say about this waste of paper.Utterly boring, badly written speculative gossip.No wonder it's Unathorized.No wonder Mick didn't want it published.Let's face it, some of this stuff is true, I mean, c'mon, It's only Rock 'n Roll, but he likes it.Pass on this one.The only redeeming quality about this loser of a book are the funny quotes.I'll leave you with one from Keith Richards.""Mick? He's a lovely bunch of guys"""
1,Jagger Unauthorized is a waste of time,"I was hoping to read an interesting book on Mick Jagger's life. I picked this piece of thrash up at the library. It is horribly written. I don't believe any editing was done on the book. In one passage, Anderson mistakenly writes ""himself"" in reference to Jagger's lover, Marianne Faithful. I'm glad I borrowed this from the public library. I wouldn't spend a dime on this book."
3,Good Background,"A little out of date but since I'll be visiting for the history, that's fine. Well written descriptions of the countries, their often regrettable recent history. Appreciated Lonely Planet's typical viewpoint."
3,"Lonely Planet Guatemala, Belize & Yucatan","While being a good general guide it is not, as others seem to believe, for those of you interested in getting ""off the beaten path"". You will end up visiting the same sites as the rest of the thousands that have purchased this book and others like it. Also, keep in mind that this book has not been updated in three years and is not to be relied upon heavily. I do believe the Lonely Planet series is quite helpful, but remember that you are the true judge of what you see and experience."
3,A comprehensive review of earlier works on hert lung machine,"As a new commer to the world of cardiac surgery I have started to learn the works of the forefathers of cardiac surgery. Dr. Shumaker has appropriately gathered enormous information on the subject of development of heart lung manchine and narrated it in simple language that can be easily understood by medical and nonmedical readers alike. I learned a great deal about the hardship and dedication that was put to work behind the evolution of present cardiac surgey by reading this book. It is a must read for all those who are interested in knowing the minds and imaginations of great people like Dr. Gibbon who shaped the unthinkable task of operating on the heart. One factor in this book that I particularly found it to be annoying is the description of family background of Gibbon(s), even though they hailed from very respectable families, this extended discription will not interest an average reader."
5,Inspirational Book of Dreams,"Jim Bickford's Las Vegas Dreams is a must-read for anyone wanting to know how Las Vegas, as well as the American dream, was built. This book contains story after story of how people we all know came from humble beginnings, overcoming obstacles to be leaders and legends in many walks of life. Entertaining, insightful and well researched, Las Vegas Dreams was a pleasure to read."
1,DANGER!,"This book was entertaining for a few miniutes. The ways to open it were quite entertaining.I had a few friends over for a party one night, we were drinking and discussing the book. One of the ones is open it with your teeth. Me being drunk at the time figured ""Ok"". I chipped a tooth.I would just like to warn all about the dangers of mixing this book and alcohol."
3,The Big Fix,"I've been looking for a copy of this film. I was visiting L.A. in 1977 when this film was in production, and happened upon a location shoot & watched while one of scenes in the movie, where Richard Dreyfuss walks across a parking lot and onto Santa Monica Pier, was being filmed.When I later went to see the movie in the theater, I was surprised to see that my car ended up clearly visible in that scene, as the camera followed 'Moses Wine' as he walked along past the front of my car. It was a distinctive looking car, a green 1950 Pontiac panel sedan delivery with NY plates, which even back then was practically an antique."
2,Trio Paraiso,"I'll first start by saying that for the money, this CD is worth the small investment made. While listening to it, I found myself comparing this trio to Los Panchos. Not a good idea. The style of Trio Paraiso although similar is not quite up to par of the successful and talented Panchos. The voices and octaves do not blend to give the songs an almost unison vocal semblance that is characteristic of Los Panchos.The two very familiar tango cuts leave a bit to be desired. A bit too ""sweet"" as compared to authentic Argentinian style.All that said, though, I would still recommend this CD because the lyrics are hauntingly beautiful and memorable. A good step in the right direction for a novice in this style of Latin music."
3,Slow Paced!,"If you enjoy reading about the middle ages, and you enjoy adventure, strong characters, and a battle of wills, this novel may be lacking, as I found it lacking. I would suggest Heather Graham's/Shannon Drake's 'Princess of Fire' which is a five star or 'The King's Pleasure' which I gave 4 1/2 stars. I didn't particularly care for Danielle, the heroine in the King's pleasure (as I stated in my review for that novel), however, the historical events, the battle of wills, the intrique and mystery made up for Danielle's lack of sensibility"
3,Caution about assembly....,"I opted for this play house because I wanted something fairly large (I keep two kids in addition to my own) and something that looked like a house (windows, etc.). It arrived and I started assembling it. I got as far as the first four poles and packed it back in the box to return it. It looked cool, but I knew that it would be one of those things I never got out for the kids because it would be such a big pain to assemble and disassemble. I ordered the Megaland Pop-Up Playset as a replacement. It doesn't look like a house, but it has the other functionality that is more important to me. Hope this helps!"
2,Fresh series goes stall,"I really enjoyed Mr. Synder's two previous novels and was looking forward to reading his latest. I enjoyed the witty dialogue and funny, yet realistic story lines from his previous work. I expected the same in the new novel. I don't know if the author was hurried by his publisher or if he is running out of ideas, but I was rather disappointed when I finished the novel. The plot was weak and the characters just seem to sit around like they were waiting for the author to tell them what to do. The story never seemed to go anywhere and it just sort of ended. In some cases, I was confused as to what was going on. The book seemed hurried and I felt it could have used a little more proof reading. Hopefully, this is just a bump in Mr. Synder's writing career. Maybe he should start another series with fresh new characters."
5,"Clever, witty writing and a story that hooks you from page 1","Keith Snyder's talent is showing again and he just keeps getting better. Snyder is not your average mystery writer. He manages to combine good writing, witty dialogue, clever plotting and three of the most engaging and real characters you've ever wanted to spend time with. And, believe me, it is time well spent!(Personally, I think I'm a little in love with Robert, the Friendly Giant.)"
1,Don't Buy,"I bought this phone about a month ago because I was looking for a cheap phone with caller ID. Needless to say this phone is cheap for a reason. The phone requires 4 AA batteries to get the caller ID to work. When I put them in the caller ID showed nothing. I thought it was broken until I found that I could see the caller ID if I held the phone at an angle and in the light. If I looked straight on, I saw nothing. The caller ID system is a joke. If you are buying this phone for solely the PHONE, then it is a good purchase. But if you want this phone for the caller ID system then save your money. It isn't backlit and it is impossible to read. I have already ordered a different phone."
1,Caller ID does not work,"I bought this phone for my kitchen. I wanted a wall-mounted phone with caller id.The phone was easy to set up, after inserting 4 new batteries, I set all the options (contrast, date and time, area code, etc.). Everything worked correctly EXCEPT the caller id. Callers are not shown, even the number of calls received does not increase. Batteries were fine since I could see all the other data displayed (date, time, et.) on the screen.I thought it was just bad luck and returned the phone to the store in exchange for a 2nd one of the same kind.Same thing with the 2nd phone too...I am returning it to the store today and will definitely not buy from this brand again.BTW: I have caller id on other phones in the house so the problem is not from the service being installed or not."
3,"Please help, lost instructions! Can't program or receive ID","For the love of GOD can someone please tell me how to program this thing? I bought it a long time ago and never bothered to put batteries in it. Needless to say I lost the box and instructions long ago, and I can't find the magical key combination to enter into the mode to set the time, date, language, etc., and caller ID doesn't work at all until this is set (I assume, since it isn't working even though the display does work and counts the time of a call). If you buy this phone, make sure to keep the instructions until you set it up! :)"
4,A very well presented argument-line.,"This is definately a must read for any researcher on the Hollew Earth Theory.It contains a well defined outline as to what exactly the Hollow Earth is, and provides interesting proofs to support this theory.Whether or not they are true is irrelevant. What is important is that there are scholars amongst us who are not satisfied by simply accepting current ideas about our natural environment but wish to challenge them, perhaps opening new platforms of understanding the world we live in. Mr. Bernard is one of these people. A refreshing read.Kilroy Montgomery (University of New South Wales)"
2,"Sorry, this is a ""call-out"" not a review....","Hi, Sorry this isn't a review for the book. I just really want to contact Douglas A. Detelj. He made an entry here and mentioned he would like to talk with like minded people. I tried his e-mail but it doesn't exist. Basically I'm hoping he'll read this or someone can help me contact him somehow.Again, sorry about this intrusion but I really want to talk with this individual.Thank you.Oh, and I'm definetly going to order this book!"
1,Nonsense,"If you read this book as a fantasy, then it is mildly interesting. Otherwise, it is simple foolishness."
2,Shameless bootleg from other CD's by O.P.,"This is a shameless bootleg, copied directly from other CD's that are still in print. I doubt that Oscar's estate will get one cent from any royalties. I guess the copyright expired now that the material is more than 50 years on. The sound is muddy (of course, it's a copy). You will be better off to try and pick up these early sides on a couple of the legitimate Canadian issues, on RCA, and on Verve. You'll hear the difference sonically and Peterson's heirs will get paid."
1,Careful what you buy!,I had no idea that there were multiple Learn Though Music versions. My grandson was very unhappy when he got two new (actually used but new to him) games that will not fit in his player. Be careful what you buy! It says NO WHERE that there are different versions of this player. The cartridges themselves look the same but there is about a half inch difference in size.
1,Did not fit the new Touchpad,"I purchased this item thinking it would fit the new ""Learn Through Music Touchpad"" I purchased for my 2 year old grandson. It must be cartridge for an earlier version of the toy, because it would not fit in the new one I had purchased. I was raked over the coals by Amazon for not only return shipping, but also for the original cost to ship it to me. I recommend that the description of this cartridge include the fact that it will not fit any newer touchpad. After contacting Amazon customer service a refund was issued for the shipping. Thank you Amazon!"
1,dissatisfied,"Be sure you are ordering the right cartridge. I bought a Learn Through Music ""touch pad"". The discription for the touch pad or game cartridges doesn't say anything about a ""touch pad"" game cartridge or regular game cartridge.My 2year old grand daughter was so happy to get a new game and then it wouldn't fit (this cartridge is smaller), she was not very impressed."
1,chapters missing,"la novela no esta completa, le faltan capitulos, yo compre la novela para que ya no me siguiera desvelando, y resulta que le cortaron capitulos, ahora de todas maneras tengo que ver la por que lo que ustedes me vendieron esta incompleto, yo no lo recomiendo, es mas quiero que me regresen mi dinero, por que yo pague para ver la novela completa no a medias."
4,Comentario Sobre la Edicion en Dvd de Para Volver a Amar,"Estoy Esperando que llegue el 22 de Noviembre para Comprar este Dvd. Sinceramente no vi la Novela de forma completa, mas bien me la recomendaron y quiero tenerla en Dvd. Por otra parte Me Gusta Mucho Rebecca Jones, es Muy Buena Actriz, la Historia tiene un Buen Elenco y la Novela Fue Todo Un Exito en Mexico y en Estados Unidos, espero que el Dvd valga la pena y que contenga un Buen Resumen con las Mejores Escenas.Cuando Lo Tenga y Vea les cuento que tal esta el Resumen...29/11/2011: Me Encanto el Dvd, Contiene un Buen Resumen con las Mejores Escenas, Tiene una Duracion de Más de 12 Horas y Ademas Material Extra con Bloopers y el Trailer de la Novela, a pesar de que en la Contraportada no dice que contiene Material Adicional.Muy Buena Telenovela. Exelente Historia. 100% Recomendable!!! Comprenlo Si Les Gusto Para Volver a Amar, No Se Van a Arrepentir."
4,They are larger than expected,They are about 2 sizes larger than I wear.But for long rides they serve good to keep the feet protected.
5,Great riding Boots,"I wasn't sure when I ordered these boots as the price seemed a little cheap. I was pleasantly surprised and I just love these boots. They are well constructed, look great and are comfy as well. A nice boot for a great price."
2,I don't know really...,"This one is for the die hard fans.From listening to this, I realized I'm not one of them.So I returned to the Shangri-Las as always."
1,What happened ?,"When I heard that Mary Weiss of the Shangri-Las had cut a new release, I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy. Back-in-the-day her voice soaredover the airwaves. As a teen-ager she took you up, she took you down. She kept you on the edge and you felt that you had shared some of the same romantic feelings that she conveyed. I don't know what happened but in this release Mary does not seem to go about this with confidence. Many cuts are off-key and the band also cuts in and out inappropriately and also off-key. Bad sound and production. The audio sounds like something that you recorded in a ""Put the dollar in the slot"" for a recording of your voice and a personel CD for your boyfriend. I feel bad writing this.I was hopeful for so much more from Mary. Maybe next time."
4,Still Tough,"Thanks to a pal of mine I found out the lead singer of the Shangri La's headed back into the studio to record her first album in about 30 odd years. I'm so glad he told me and I'm so glad I bought this.Her voice is a bit deeper now but it's still that sass a frass Mary behind the mic. She even does a cover of ""Heaven Only Knows"" an old Shangri La's hit, and the music is very much in the vein of her former band, but with some added attitude and a few swear words here and there. I just can't believe she's waited this long to record but where ever she was hiding it's worth it, cause she sounds amazing and the songs are all really good. Just listen to some of the songs and you'll be hooked like it's a brisky day in 1966."
5,this is a great album for Mary Weiss fans!!!,"After I listened to it a couple of times, I was hooked. Please, please continue to record! It is now my favorite album. I did not realize how much I miss her style until they brought it back. Thank you to Mary and the band!!!"
5,Pure 60s Magic,"Capturing the classic 60s sound, Mary Weiss in her first solo effort does it in style. The voice, the band, the songs all come together. From the opening licks of My Heart is Beating, to the touching end of You Can Stay With Me conjure up images of the Shangri-Las, The Ronnettes, Del Shannon, Carol King and Bruce Springsteen.This is a must for anyone who loves the 60s sound."
4,Dangerous Game - A welcome return,"Great rock and roll from an old master. Mary Weiss has reappeared on the scene with a unique sound, great backing with a Spectorian 'Wall' - Great stuff, lets have some more Mary!!"
5,The Fixt It Guy,"Works great, pre-filters sand, grit, and splashed water. Will keep the oiled K&N cleaner longer. Wish it was water resistant longer than the indicated 6 months. Buy it, it is well worth though."
5,Wow,"One of my favorite TV theme compilations of all time..and just about the only place you can find good versions of IT TAKES A THIEF and THE NAME OF THE GAME. Gregory's version of CANNON is pretty darn good, too."
2,Elevator Music,"I was expecting the original themes (such as Name of the Game, Mannix, and Banacek). What I got was remakes that sound like elevator music versions of the originals. Mission Impossible just about put me to sleep instead of ramping me up like the original does.If you want fully orchestrated, put you to sleep, elevator music then this is the CD for you. [...]."
4,Very good insight on the expedition and how slaves were treated,I loved the way the author cleared the air on others who wrote about York in a negative way. The speculations about facts that are not known about York make a lot of sense. The footnotes alone were very informative. Great reading.
1,Where's the survival tale?,"Where is the tale of survival? If I had known it was a story of two men waxing poetic over "" the clean slabs"" of canyons and their ""striations of claret colors"", I never would have spent 9.99 downloading it to my kindle. This tale should never be placed under survival genre. The endless prose...""Man, you might say, is nature dreaming, but rock And water and sky are constant...."" Oh please!!! My brain is tired of all this dribble. If I wanted it I would go sit and meditate at some new age commune. I wanted a good survival tale..not listening to this ""Dirk"" character rage on and on. I truly spent half the book anxiously awaiting the monent when one of them would fall into a canyon slot, you know...get his hand or foot stuck or something! The trip was exhausting, self important, and boring. Amazon...please place it in philosophy. That is what it is!"
2,Let's talk about real survival,"With all due respect (I find most of Craig's other books written with both elegance and restraint; amd his solo explorations acts of courage and surrender.), these two men went out for a month, with top-of-the-line gear, plenty of food (cached and otherwise) and, in fact, were in no real danger. A real survivor is a grandmother on food stamps, taking care of and loving five grand-kids, in a roach motel, with no vehicle and a greedy landlord.Or a woman with a double mastectomy, who finds out she had bone cancer and decides it is time to learn how to drum because she has wanted to all her life, and knows each 3-month check-up might be her last."
5,A hard-hitting account of discovery,"A two-weep trip through the American Southwest with a good friends turns into a challenge which will test friendship and survival skills in THE WAY OUT: A TRUE STORY OF RUIN AND SURVIVAL. Any with a special affection for the Southwest will find vivid descriptions of its terrain and desolation as they enjoy this memoir of survival, a hit in hardcover and newly available in paperback to provide a hard-hitting account of discovery.Diane C.

5,"Not so popular band, but great CD","In the fall of 2003 I went to see Revis play at the Hard Rock in Chicago. Well, Swizzle Tree was an opening act, and to say the least, they were awesome! I bought this CD at the concert and played it out. I still listen to it often and plan to see them again live this fall! I would really recommend this CD. Swizzle Tree has a very unique sound, dissimilar to mainstream rock, but they are awesome. It is a CD you can play all the way through, each song is great. The lyrics are clean too, with no swearing or vulgar talk. Great band!"
4,Practical lessons to keep you on track and in the black!,"Gardner Russell gives an ""insiders"" view of the pitfalls small businesses must overcome to survive. Written in anecdotal form, each chapter covers a specific, business threatening problem Mr. Russell faced starting and running a variety of businesses in the USA and Puerto Rico. Each chapter concludes with an explanation of how he was able to overcome the challange and save the company.These practical lessons will help the budding entrepreneur stay on track and in the black.

3,pretty catchy cut,i dug the vibe of this cut&the overall take on this cut.I Ain't that Big on Jay Z but this Cut was alright.
2,Bad microphone,"My daughter got this present for her one year birthday. She loved it!!!!! But one week later, my 3 year old nephew came over and somehow ruined the microphone. Since my nephew is 3 and does not have a slobber problem from teething or anything, the micorphone should have been able to handle it. Since it can't even handle a 3 year old, I wonder how long it could survive a one year old who was still teething. And since the microphone is ruined now, everytime the piano is turned on, there is very loud and annoying static. She can't play with it anymore."
3,great for a 1 year old,"My 14 month old got this for his 1st birthday and it definitely keeps his interest. There are different settings to allow him to play the piano, make animal sounds, or just beat the ""drum."" There is a low volume setting which is GREAT. The only thing that is annoying is that it keeps talking to entice your child to it for about 10 minutes after he stops playing with it."
5,My son loves this,We gave this to my son on his first birthday. From the minute he opened it he loved it. He's now 15 months and still loves it. He likes to sing in the microphone. My 3 year old even has plaed with it from time to time.
5,Very fun and lots of activities in one toy!,"My 14 month son loves this toy! He just got it a few weeks ago, but it seems like it would be great for 9 months and up. He loves the music, the dancing dog and the lights. His favorite part is probably the microphone. The only thing is that you kind of have to have your mouth on the microphone to hear it, but he loves to howl into it and hear himself. It's very durable, with him dragging it by the microphone."
3,Another broken Mic!!,"This is a wonderful toy, other then the mic, with developed a short in it after a very short period of time. The wire to the mic is too flimsy for the age group it is listed for."
3,worked for a few months,My daughter loved this toy but as others have said the microphone died after a couple months probably from the my daughters slobber. Even when the mic worked you could barely hear it.
4,Seeks Out the Entertainer In Your Child,"This is a great gift. My sister gave it to my daughter for Christmas and my daughter continues to play with this toy.It has keyboard for her to play, learn numbers, different sounds etc... It's so fun. Plus it has a connected microphone which my daughter loves. She puts her mouth to it and tries to sing. It's really adorable when you hear her on microphone setting. She shakes her shoulders and finds her groove. It's hilarious.I highly recommend this toy. It will keep your child entertained for a long while."
2,Drives me insane...but my son loves it,"Personally, I hate this toy. Of all the toys my 8 month old son has that make noise, this is the most obnoxious. When I finally can't take it anymore, I have to shut it off and lure my son to another toy.My son, on the other hand, LOVES it. He's not old enough to be coordinated with it yet, but he loves the lights and constant music/noise. It is only because he seems to love it so much that I haven't thown it out the window.If you're looking for a piano for your child, get a different one. This isn't a piano as much as it is just a music machine. If nothing else, for your own sanity get a different one! Not to mention the microphone broke after about 2 months...."
3,"Great, even when broken","I bought this for my 10 month old daughter. After 2 weeks, the microphone broke, and the music started to have static. After about another 2 weeks, the static subsided, somewhat. My daughter still loves it. I am disappointed in V-tech. My daughter still tries to sing into the microphone occasionally. I miss listening to her babble into it. It was so cute. Now she just dances to the music. I would purchase it for my daugher again."
1,great toy that broke very quickly,"my daughter absolutely loved this toy at 8 months. she learned to use the microphone quickly & it was a huge favorite. however, the toy developed a problem with some kind of short in the microphone cord that causes very nasty sounding static after only 6 weeks of use. it is definitely not up to v-tech's usual high quality."
4,Great for babies who don't drool!,"I purchased this product for my 10 month old and he adores it. The only problem is that the microphone stoped working (and made a terrible crackling noise) after only a few weeks. We exchanged it for another piano and the same thing happened to the new one as well. The piano is also very sensitive to drool (granted, it is intended for children 12mo's + - probably for this reason) and occassionally has to be taken apart to air out! Although the microphone still doesn't work, my son loves it so much that I would never consider returning it. I think it's a really cute toy and would recommend it for children over 1 year (or babies who don't drool too much!)."
5,good toy for infants,This is an attractive toy for infants and toddlers. The music and lights are nice.
1,Way to LOUD!,"I tried this toy at it's lowest volume, and it's still lound enough to damage young eardrums. Remember that this toy is much closer to their ears than yours."
3,It broke so quickly,"We bought this toy for $19.99 from Amazon and eligible for free shipping. Microphone broke in a month. There was a very loud and annoying static for some time, and then in 8 months the toy was completely ruined. While it lasted my son enjoyed it very much"
2,"Microphone needs to be fixed, so it lasts more than a month!","We received this as a gift for my daughters first birthday, she absolutely loved it, in no time at all she figured out how to use the microphone. She loved the lights and music and would dance. BUT in less than a month it was broke!!! Called Vtech and had to send the item back (at my expense) for a replacement. And 6 weeks later I received the replacement, needless to say my daughter was overjoyed to have her toy back, and low and behold............after 3 weeks the microphone did not work again!!!! If you are going to make a toy for 12mos-3yrs you really need to make it more durable!!! the cord seems to pull just enough to break the connection somewhere, and thus a very unhappy 1 year old (and mom). I guess I could play the send it back and get a new one, but until they fix the cord for the microphone, I will just skip it, not worth the shipping each and every time."
3,microphone problems,WE bought this for my son when he was 1 and the microphone worked only for maybe a month then it broke and the music had static in it. It was $30 at the time so I was dissapointed in it.
2,uncertain,"I read many of the reviews on this product~after I ordered it for my grandson for his 1rst birthday~now I worry! Seems this toy doesn't hold up well, if I listen to what I read. This was not a cheap toy once you've added s&h; then taxes. I could tell by looking at the picture that the microphone cord was indeed short but thought it might not present any problems. As for the static I read about, now that upsets me. I'll have my daughter keep me informed on the performance of this toy and it's life span. I do understand it's gonna get beat up by the little tyke. I'll be back with the history of my grandson's first piano.Cindy Breault"
3,Poor Quality Mastering,"This is widely considered to be a classic album, so if you plan on buying it, do yourself a favor and seek out another edition. This edition is poorly digitally mastered and features quite a bit of annoying digital clipping, harsh crackles that distract from the music. You might be tempted by the lower than usual price, but you'll get what you pay for. If you're reading this at all, I don't have to tell you much about the music. My simple advice is to avoid this edition."
5,I'll walk the streets naked for FELA. BABA 70,"What do u want me to say? He was the greatest. I have this album and he explains his suffering and unhappiness against the Nigerian military. It is a dancing as well as relaxing CD. Get it or get out of the world, thats the only way I can describe the album."
2,A Massive Disappointment,"If you're like me, you loved Schor's previous work, The Overworked American and The Overspent American. I found them to be well written as well as thought provoking. This work, however, does follow in this pattern.First of all, contrary to the clever marketing, the vast majority of it is not written by Schor at all. It's basically a Schor tribune book. A bunch of far lesser known scholars put forth their theories on consumption in a sort of reply to what Schor has said in her previous research.Further, what these other scholars have to say is just not that interesting. It doesn't fill a void in our collective knowledge the way that Schor's original work did.Overall, I think this book is a pretty shameless attempt to cash in on Schor's popularity. However, there are a few interesting points and for those most interested in consumption research, it may be worth a read."
4,Interesting Soundtrack From Two Members of Asia,"This CD isn't really rare tracks by Asia - it is music by two members of Asia, John Payne and Geoff Downes, which they wrote for a documentary called ""Salmon: Against the Tides."" The music is highly recommended: it is beautiful and interesting and sounds at times like Tangerine Dream and Moby. However, the CD really should have been titled ""John Payne and Geoff Downes: Salmon: Against the Tides"" and not marketed under the Asia name."
1,"""Rare"" should have stayed rare - as in ""unheard by others""","The latest incarnation of Asia has never been afraid to dump its discards on fans. Witness the abominable Archiva 1 & 2 - nothing more than abandoned tracks dumped on a gullible fanbase. ""Rare"" is more of the same - lifeless soundtarck work from a salmon documentary, coupled with snippets of sound for an abandoned video game concept. This is ""Asia""? How the mighty have fallen - hard."
5,Excellent CD,"I first heard the song ""Just Kills Me"" as background music on a You Tube video and looked it up online. That's when I discovered this CD on Amazon.com and bought it. All the songs are very good. Michael Clarke has a great voice and the lyrics are outstanding."
2,Different,"I had to purchase this for a class in my rn to bsn program. The book did succeed in helping me to think about my health and wellness in a more holistic fashion, but a lot of the questions/statements were a bit odd and overly reflective of the authors' personal opinions. the booklet gives the impression that it was authored by a flower child."
4,Handy but outdated -- Wish he'd publish it again!,"I teach high school world history and I picked up a copy of this great little book in our library's discard pile. The first few chapters offer an excellent background to these two opposing political viewpoints. Kronenwetter starts with the Enlightenment and explores how those ideas shaped the American and French Revolutions. Unfortunately, this book was published in 1984 so it does not include more recent information. Mr. Kronenwetter, if you read this, PLEASE update this book and publish a newer addition! Otherwise, this is a great resource for teachers and students. I'm definitely going to share Kronenwetter's information with my class."
5,Prose that matches the beauty of the subject,This book is a magnificent expansion of what a novel can be. Those looking for an connect the dot plot line with traditional climaxes and conflicts may wish to stick to less challenging fare. Those who wish to explore an inspiring type of beauty and a character driven tale with great characters and interesting historical references buy this today. This is a debut that bodes very well for a promising future for Mr. Wharton.
3,"Brilliantly written, but disappointing","I read this book with the greatest of expectations. They were based upon the synopsis printed on the rear cover of the book and the artwork on the front cover.Mr. Wharton did an excellent job of visually depicting the vast stretches of the icefields. He did for writing, what Ansel Adams did for black and white photography.However, I was expecting more of a story based upon the synopsis. The theme outlined held a lot of promise as to what could possibly occur. Unfortunately, I was waiting in vain for it to occur. He never delivered on that theme. The synopsis of the theme was the main reason I chose to read ""Icefields.""The story concerned the saga of Doctor Edward Byrne and many eccentric and colorful characters he met in his travels, set in the harsh beauty of the Canadian icefields.Had that been the synopsis, I would have read the book with different expectations, and I would not have been disappointed."
1,Great expectations in the beginning,"I had great expectations in the beginning of this ""novel"" It reads more like a first draft that has gleanings of a masterpiece, but that needs a bunch more revisions. Some readers found the author's convoluted style exhilarating, I found it troublesome. Still Wharton's language is beautiful, and he uses a variety of interesting techniques, but he switches back and forth between time periods, characters and settings entirely too quickly for my tastes. I recommend it for a challenging read that evokes the haunting surreal qualities of a glacier."
2,"He can write, but this is not a novel!","Thomas Wharton has talent as evidenced by some of the most beautiful passages of original prose I have ever read. But what a disappointment Icefields is for the lover of true novels. The word ""novel"" stands for something and we novel readers are entitled to the fulfillment of certain minimum expectations. This is a convoluted, plotless diatribe that reads less like a novel and more like the badly edited journal of a writer lost in the wilderness. Match Thomas Wharton's innate talent up with a terrific story idea and I think you'd have a great novel. But Icefields is an example of why good writing just isn't enough. I WANT A GREAT, COMPELLING STORY!"
3,Passable,"I bought this book on a whim, so I wasn't too disappointed upon finding it to be a fairly average and forgettable book. The prose is rather sparse, which Wharton may have done purposefully to match the setting of the novel. Some people might like it, but it was not to my taste."
2,a solid boot to the face,"System 7, a duo bursting at the seems with talent and potential, bizarrely enough, seem have found contentment in producing a monotonous stream of uninventive and decidedly poor dance tracks, leaving very little room for actual innovation. Tunes such as Faydeaudeau and similar just go to prove how under-exploited their talent is -for the greater part, the other songs just make me cringe in agony as the inevitable 4/4 beat kicks in, delivering with it, a solid boot to the face of any hint at quality that dared submerge its dainty features during the opening seconds or minutes. Mektoub is a prime example of this, a beautiful and moving soundscape laid to waste by their blatant lack of effort to even attempt something new or accomplished. As it stands, practically every song is a lazy and predictable affair, leaving me sour, gagging for my daily dosage of Orb, Sun Electric or Thomas Fehlmann."
1,Bore-o,This album is the most boring album I have ever bought. The artists of this group should no better than to make their songs around 10 minutes when the song consists entirely of 1 measure being repeated an ungodly amount of times. I truly think I and almost everyone else could make better music if we only had the tools and the time. What defines this album --- Boredom.
5,12 year body builder man,This is a good product. The best energy product period. I work unloading trailers for ten hours a day and blow everyone else at work away. Then I still have plenty of energy to do a 3 hour work out. It will put on about 5 to 8 pounds of lean muscle. It is worth the money. Make sure to drink lots of water on it.
4,A Classic in Every Sense,"While dated and simplistic in many ways, this is so much more than a ""monster"" film. It is very different from Shelley's book, but it manages to capture the main ideas of the Romantic movement - that science sullies nature by making it understandable, and that the life of reason promised by the enlightenment would not lead to happiness. Even today as we have our lives improved and extended by technologies unimaginable at the time of the film (let alone the book), the entire world still struggles with these issues. Will we return to the simple, short, and technology-free life of the middle ages or move forward to the wonders still promised by the enlightenment? Undoubtedly the book and the film will continue to play a major role in how our culture struggles with that question."
5,Frankenstein (1931),"Crisp, clear video and sound. The detail is so much better than VHS, you will feel as though you are in the laboratory. Colin Clive's lines, spoken after the monster comes to life, are easily heard. On VHS they were obscured by the thunder. The bonus features are not to be missed. A definite keeper."
5,Whale and Karloff: Perfect Together!,"Nowhere close to Shelley's novel but it makes no difference! Eerie, eccentric and atmospheric, this classic offers nothing but top drawer! Whale's vision is impeccable; sets are moody and gripping, but it is Karloff who mesmerizes with a performance that is a work of art in a role that allows no dialogue but punishing make-up and costuming. Even the distinguished DeNiro didn't come close to the pathos, confusion, sadness and panic of Boris Karloff's elegant and ageless performance. It gets better and better with each viewing."
3,An entertaining literary inaccuracy!,"Ridiculous? Absolutely! Literarily inaccurate? For sure! ...but, from a 1931 viewer's perspective, was it entertaining? Without a doubt!What I want to know is ...who is ""Henry"" Frankenstein anyway? Is he a bizarre combination of Victor Frankenstein and Henry Clerval from Mary Shelly's tale? Or perhaps Hollywood felt that Henry is a better name for the protagonist and the name Victor should be reserved for the handsome family friend (???). Also - what about the hunchbacked Fritz ... I seemed to remember Victor Frankenstein's journey into his mad obsession to be a solitary one. ...And so forth and so on!Despite all of this, I still think this is a must watch for classic movie buffs and Mary Shelly fans."
4,Classic,Classic storyline told in an old world view... it's an old movie and most won't find it to their liking but I believe the ancient feel only enhances that this story was written by Mary Shelley a long time ago.
1,Where is Mary Shelley's Frankenstein?,"I was delighted to receive the video in the mail today. What timing! My class of high school seniors has finished reading Mary Shelley's novel and will be taking their final tomorrow. Afterwards, I thought they would really enjoy the film. Unfortunately, I just finished viewing it and am sick. This adaptation is nothing like the book. I am scrambling around looking for one that is! I honestly feel I have wasted $...---and on my miserable salary that's painful! The acting, sets, script, camera work, and editing are ridiculously crude. I wish I had saved my money and spent it elsewhere!"
1,Junkenstein,"Hi! I'm your Movie Review Girl! Are you tired of real drama, good actors, and deep dialogue? Do you poop out at movie parties? Is your good taste unpopular? The answer to all your problems is in this little movie. Yes, Frankenstein. Frankenstein contains staged drama, stiff actors, parroted dialogue and lots of growling by an emotionless monster. With Frankenstein you can earn your status as a classy movie viewer. All you do is take five minutes after every Hitchcock movie. It's so tasteless, too. Just like dryer lint! So why don't you join the thousands of bright, misled people and buy a great big DVD of Frankenstein tomorrow? Remember that name! That's Frank-en-stein."
1,Awful filmmaking!,"The problem with this film is that it's a very poor adaptation of Mary Shelley's gothic novel. If I recall, the first scene is of Dr. F-- at a cemetery to exhume body parts. There's no build up. The next scene or so sees Dr. F-- in his lab with the creature, and get this, he spills the beans of what he's about to do. It was at this point I stopped watching. Did the producers of this film actually read the book? Also, the acting is heavy handed and overwrought. Really, almost unwatchable. How did it ever become such a classic? The only thing I can think of is that most of the filmgoers have never read the novel."
3,Frankenstein 1931,"Boris Karloff is the only Frankenstein. This movie brings back memories of Nightmare Theater in Dallas in the early 1960's on TV channel 11. Most notable are the electrical spark machines that bring the monster to life. The film quality was not as good as I thought it would be on tape or DVD, but the story and spookiness does overcome this. The B&W adds to the spookie atmosphere. One drawback - the movie only lasts about 70 minutes. I would rate the movie much higher if the clarity were better and it lasted longer, but this an all time collector's movie. Always great to watch around Hallowe'en and with the kids late at night with pizza or nachos."
4,Gothic Classic!,"The film is based on the first half of Mary Shelley's gothic novel Frankenstein where Dr. Frankenstein reanimates life. The being that he creates becomes a product of its' environment while continuing to learn through trial and error. Unfortunately, its' errors become magnified by its' physical attributions, which causes unrest among those it comes in contact with through simple attempts at communication. Whale's horror creation was made over 70 years ago; however, one catch phrase, ""It's alive!"", that terrified audiences in the 30s, still produces chills in audiences today. Therefore, regardless of age, the film still provides a tremendous cinematic experience."
5,THE MAN WHO MADE A MONSTER... OR TWO.,"It's true... in this excellent 1931 horror classic, the townsfolk give a toast to ""Young Frankenstein!"" during the preperation for his wedding. Those who love Mel Brooks take note, this is most likley where the title for his own Frankenstein came from... but for the first, and the original, you can't go wrong with this DVD release. On a fiddle factor if one to ten, Frankenstein gets a eight for extra's. An original documentary (plus BOO! - which I don't want to give anything away on), photos and stills, cast bios and more, adding Frakenstein to your collection is a smart choice. There only negitive I have is the feature commentary by Rudy Behlmer comes across a tad conversational, almost as if he just happened to drop by and you were watching Frankenstein... but it's not that bad. Worth buying."
3,"Superb quality, but disappointing extras.","Give this DVD five stars for sparkling audio and video quality, though the commentary is a bit dry and somewhat tedious (Behlmer actually reads paragraph after paragraph from the Shelley book)and the documentary seems slanted toward those who know little about the film's history. Best comments are from Paul Jensen and Gregory Mank."
4,frankenstein dvd,"this is a classic movie, filmed in the 1930's, i was a little skeptical how it would be put on dvd, however i was not disappointed and the dvd was in good condition and played very well. i have enjoyed introducing my children, the youngest, 7 yrs old, to this classic horror film. having order many dvds from amazon sellers, most used, i have yet to make a bad or even slightly disappointing purchase. suffice to say, i have been very happy adding to my dvd collection with my purchases from amazon and will continue to do so."
2,Classic in Name only,"I bought this dvd to show my students after having read Frankenstein, well, both the students and I found the movie laughably bad. Yes, some of that is due to the technological limits of the time, but some of the other problems are inexcusable (why are Victor and Henry's names switched? Why does the movie start of the way it doe?, etc.) All and all, it is a movie I wished I would have rented rather than purchasing because it is doubtful that I will ever use it in my classroom again."
2,A Big Esoteric Doorstop,"Okay, so I did actually buy this at a thrift store. But I looked up my horoscope in it for my birth date, moon phase and etc, and was not at all pleased by the negative combination of traits dealt out for me. I decided to look up my mother's horoscope, and hers was also excessively negative to the point of being hurtful. The ONLY thing that I liked about this book is that the pictures for each planet's goddess/fairy whatever were really beautiful. I plan to cut these pictures out and most likely frame them. The rest of the book I may use for a doorstop. Sorry, astrology fans, this is not a good book to work with. Go buy some Tarot cards instead and learn how to tap into the random energies of the universe, as opposed to the fixed aspects of natal charts. We are ever-changing beings who are free to redefine ourselves at any given moment......,3*<"
1,littlewing,"my book was falling apart when i got it, for the time i waited and money i paid i could have gone to my local book store and bought one in mint condition for a little more."
1,A worthless review,"This book does not review you for the test. The practice exams are nothing like the actual SAT II; they are instead geared to judge how much you remember from the book's review section. Many answers to the questions from the practice exams are simply, a disturbing realization when one applies such knowledge to the rest of the book. The book does offer two hundred pages of detailed, if sometimes confused, historical review, so if one lacks a history textbook, this might do, but if you actually want to review for the SAT II in any meaningfull manner, don't read this book."
5,Recommended,"THE JOY OF FEARING GOD by Jerry Bridges is an excellent book on an often over-looked topic in modern Christianity. In the first chapter he states his premise clearly: ""There was a time when committed Christians were known as God-fearing people. This was a badge of honor. But somewhere along the way we lost it. Now the idea of fearing God, if thought of at all, seems like a relic from the past. That's to our detriment. The fear of God is actually as relevant today as it was in bygone generations"" (1). In the remaining fourteen chapters he defines, describes, and illustrates what it means for Christians to individually and corporately to fear God in their lives. Chapter titles include ""Beyond Measure, Beyond Compare"" describing God's greatness, ""Transcendent Majesty"" describing God's holiness, ""He Is Lord"" describing God's sovereignty, and ""He Is Worthy"" describing how essential the fear of the Lord is in our worship."
2,Wooden Utensils,I bought this one for my kitchen but my son is using it now in his playground. I am extremely dissatisfied with the product.
5,Fabulous Chinese and English herbal cookbook!,"I have read and seen so many cook books from my mother, sisters, relatives, and friends. But I've never read such a cook book that actually writes in Chinese and English, incorporates those Chinese herbs into our daily life, gives recipes for those delicious dishes (my mother actually makes a dish out of one of the recipes, and wow..., it's tastier than most Chinese food I've eaten in restaurants. I'm sure I won't miss the rest of the recipes to come.) Amazingly, I feel I've more energy, ya, probably that's what the herbs are really for."
1,"Yea, nobody walks but nobody should read this either","This book started out as good, with the Gods of the Freeways and all and his life with parents that ran a liquor store in the Valley. HOWEVER it was very soon evident that this author lived a very privileged life in L.A. In his book, he talks about L.A. while driving around the city, but he leaves out sooo much of what L.A. is ....the part of L.A. that is L.A, a city of darkness that is over-showed by media light. He's a private catholic school kid that has NO IDEA what L.A.. This book could of been written about any city, Detroit, Miami or Charlotte...nobody walks in those cities either....he really thinks his L.A. is what L.A. is, but about 1/2 way through it's very obvious he has NOT A CLUE about L.A. just what his eyes see....quite a very LIMITED view of the (or any) city."
4,NARS The Multiple Portifino,"I just got my NARS The Multiple in portifino. I was a little surprised to find the color darker than it looks in the pictures but it turned out to be a great color. Its a deep rose color. I am fair with freckles and auburn hair so naturally I was concerned, but it turned out to be just the right pop of color on my cheecks. It lasts all day. i'm not sure that this color would be good for highlighing anywhere else on the face. Overall I would reccomend this color."
4,Nars Blush,This product is great. smooths on and does not have that powdery residue. the seller was reliable and good.
5,shopmaster knows cosmetics!,"This is a keeper. Goes on like silk . Feels awesome(no I dont drive for nascar) color has gorgeous pigment, blends beautifully. Wish I could buy every color. Ladies you cant go wrong with this one. A suggestion, dont push stick up too high not neccessary, and will only increase chance of breakage. Treat it good and it will last forever. Trust me girls, I know makeup and I want you all to look your beautiful best."
5,Incredible book,"So far my favorite seminary book. Has been clear, thorough and all encompassing. I think many other apologetical approaches struggle with using logic and reason as evidence, but it is really unnecessary!"
3,"Complete, but not quality checked","Overall I thought this book was fairly easy to read, comprehensive, and well organized. However, there are several easy to spot typos and one or two mathematical goofs (2^24 does not equal 16,777,218.) The high error rate in printing of the book that I have, and no apparent online errata listing, makes me feel like doublechecking any fine details I might use from the book."
1,Misleading!,"I purchased this ""book"" for my daughter's 3rd birthday. I found out 2 days before her party that this ""book"" -- as it is referred to numerous times in Amazon's product description and review -- is not actually a book, but a cartridge for the Learn Through Music system. The book is useless without purchasing the $35 system. Nowhere in the description does it mention that the Learn Through Music system is required to use the ""book""...it just keeps mentioning how great and educational the ""book"" is. For those unfamiliar with the very new Learn Through Music system (it isn't even listed anywhere on the Fisher Price website), it is impossible to know that this product is actually an accessory to a relatively pricey product. It comes up when searching for Dora the Explorer books and just appears that to be a neat electronic book in a series called ""Learn Through Music."" I'm very disappointed with Amazon for not being clear with the description."
2,Take some Tylenol first.,"""Let's all go to the farm to see our animal friends!Let's all go to the farm to see our animal friends!Vaminos! Vaminos! Let's go, let's go, let's go!Vaminos! Vaminos! Let's go, let's go, let's go!""If you can stand to here this little ditty three thousand times, then by all means buy this cartridge for your ""Learn Through Music"" system. This song is played on EVERY page. It drove our older kids absolutely bonkers (even with the volume turned down). We found the Blues Clues cassette to be much less irritating."
4,Almost as good as homemade,"This is delicious! The label recommends adding lemon juice and garlic, but I thought it was great as it was straight out of the can. It has a nice smokey flavour, and it had just the right degree of tartness, probably from the citric acid listed in the ingredients. It's also very smooth and consistent, no chunks of unmashed eggplant. It's almost as good as the baba ghanouj my mother used to make when we lived in Lebanon. A while ago I tried the AlWadi al Akhdar brand in a jar, and thought its flavor was a just a wee bit better, a bit more robust than this, Cortas, but Cortas consistency is better and smoother."
4,exotic excellence,"It sounds like Trey Gunn has finally come into his own unique style. You can still hear the influence of Fripp, but this disc has a very earthy, grounding feel to it. Lots of percussion add to that. Definitely not an easy listen though for someone who has never heard king crimson, fripp or Trey's earlier work"
3,HAVE YOU HEARD...,"Supersexy Swingin Sounds is sort of a dance CD for hard rock fans; it could also be called a hard rock album for dance fans. It's got that dance feel to it, except it's tough and electric-guitarish. The end result is an interesting and really unique kind of music."
2,CENSORED VERSION not obviously disclosed,"I love this album, BUT I HATE CENSORSHIP. Since it is not marked on the cover nor was it obvious anywhere else before I purchased it, I was extremely disappointed that the product I received was CENSORED!!!Yes, all the explitives have been edited out.VERY dissappointed when I received this. Wasted my money and now I still have to look for the real deal.Did I mention....I HATE CENSORSHIP!!!"
5,Supersexy Techno Metal,"White Zombie was/is one of the few 90's metal bands that I could actually listen to and enjoy. In an age of Pearl Jam and Sum 41, Rob Zombie along with Kid Rock and Metallica were pretty much the only options for 70's and 80's style music. White Zombie is super occult and sex minded with extremely racy lyrics that I cannot write here. If you want to get raucous, rawdy, and rebellious, NOTHING comes close to a good White Zombie album. Jam out to this in your car on a road trip or at a party. Zombie combines electronica, club, techno, and synth with CRUSHING metal jams. More Human than Human is just one example. Serious metal with an electronica twist! My favorite sounds ever!"
2,It's ok,"I liked the Astro-Creep 2000 better. Personally I bought the CD just to get ""I'm your Boogieman"" which was remixed anyways... I should have just bought the Crow soundtrack."
4,White Zombie - 'Supersexy Swingin' Sounds' (Geffen),"First off, let me say just how much I LOVE the lay-out art work on this CD release (hubba-hubba!). They used several full color adult pin-ups from (would have to be)the late '60's era. I must also admit that I may like this disc better than I do their 'Astro-Creep: 2000' mostly because it has a diverse sound on just about every tune. Totally dug the after dark mix of ""Electric Head Pt. 2"", the raw mix of ""Grease Paint And Monkey Brains"" and the ass-kicking wine, women and song mix of ""Blood, Milk And Sky"" the most. Great compilation CD."
5,BETTER THAN ASTROCREEP,"for anyone that likes electronic metal such as what was featured on the spawn soundtrack then this is for you.im not the biggest rob zombie fan but this cd is just phat with some really good remixes,completely different from astrocreep in a good way(not that i didnt like astro but i just enjoy this more)plain and simple,its just a great techno-metal cd thats pretty trippy.best tracks are 1 2 7 8 9-later"
3,I WOULD JUST STICK TO ASTRO CREEP,"Astro creep is absolutely incredible. Zombie likes to mess around with different sounds. I got this when it came out cuz Astro Creep was so good. Its a little bit interesting, mainly for the chick on the cover."
2,Ridiculous,"Honestly, White Zombie was techno-metal enough as it was. Why did they go and do something so stupid. These remixes are terrible. El Phantasmo and the Chicken Run Blastorama and Boogie Man are the only good tracks on here. This is just miserable. Seriously, this is a joke right?"
1,Please give me something tougher!!!,"This was a waste of my money. I figured that in the sense of White Zombie and their hard core riffs and beats, this would live up to expectations but NO. THis was a soft, limp and incomplete mix. It sounds and feels like they spent a day mixing one or 2 of the tracks and threw the rest togther in a haste. I love good techno and Heavy metal and I think that if you like the hard stuff, then you should look into Fear Factor's ""Remanufacture""; now that is a good hardcore techo mix.This is a turd."
3,Got what I wanted out of it,"The accompaniment tracks are pretty good, not too chintzy. The singers on the sample tracks are no where near the original Broadway cast, but sufficient to remind one of the performance of the songs."
3,"The Good, The Bad and The Laughable","The instrumental tracks are very good, even preformance worthy. Unfortunatly, the vocals arn't quite as good, or just sound odd (In paticular, the bizarre preformance by Sir Robin, who's flutey, alternately effeminate and rough voice can be a bit ditracting.) You'd be best off buying the actual cast recording to learn the songs than risk mimicking this CD. (Though it is fun for a laugh.)"
4,it's good,"i have the mantra edition of the cd, which looks the same as voiceprint. i enjoy the opening track, ""magick circle"". my only complaint is that i find his vocals weak. i just don't think he is a strong singer. like the lyrics, especially some of his stuff with hawkwind and gong. i guess i favor his more instrumental cds. that's just my opinion though."
5,Like a hot knife through butter.,"Used it to cut a one inch thick piece of granite and it worked great! I did take two passes to make the cut so the blade would not heat up too much, this blade was worth every penny and I would buy it again..."
2,don't meet my expectation,"It could not cut well on granite, so I have to used my old, worn out one to cut the granite. I have not tried to cut any thing else."
5,used to cut fiber cement board,I used this blade to cut fiber cement siding board. It worked fine. You do not need a special blade to cut this siding.
5,Excellent saw blade,"Just got done cutting some old,hard concrete. This blade easily cut through about 8 feet and is still in good shape. It is definitely worth the money."
1,Wrong Product x 2,"Twice I have ordered the ""SKIL 79510 7-Inch Dry or Wet Cutting Turbo Rim Diamond Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch or Diamond Knockout Arbor for Masonry"" and both time I have received a product that looks the same (As far as the saw blade goes)but with completely different labeling on the blade and a warning on the package that states ""do not expose to water, condensation, or freezing"" Since I bought the item to use in a wet tile cutting machine, this blade is useless to me."
2,Not as Advertised,"I haven't used the blades yet but, the picture of the item on the order page does not match what you receive. The packaging in the picture says it is a continous rim saw with 2x life (you can actually see the words, Continuous Rim in the upper right corner on the picture). The picture does show a segmented rim blade however, the art work on the blade you receive does not match the art work on the blade in the picture. I can't imagine how they managed to do this. Be aware, this item is not a 2x life blade."
2,It ok,not so great about this blade. just normal and heat up easily. it hard to install to the saw you have to careful with the ring it keep fall off.
3,The blade was a bit too thin for my wet saw,"Unfortunately I had to remove the splash guard attachment because this blade is pretty thin, and the cut tile wouldn't slide past the guard. The previous blad I had wa sa bit thicker and I really didn't notice until I started cutting. That said, the blade lasts really well and does nice cuts."
2,Terrible reproductions.,"I am a big fan of Winsor McCay and I have purchased all five volumes of this series that have been issued so far. It's nice to see such a big variety of the early work in print but I am afraid that some of the reproductions are atrocious. Some of the ""Pilgrim's Progress"" and ""Dream of the Rarebit Fiend"" strips appear to be third or fourth generation photocopies. I realize that not all of these strips are easy to find in decent condition but I have seen many of them in other books in far clearer reproduction. I would rather they had left the strips out then print these murky copies. I'm sorry: I really wanted to like this series but they seem to be getting worse as further volumes are issued."
5,"As good as it gets, for such a dry subject.","I am very impressed with this textbook. First off, I'd like to say that the font is very easy on the eyes, double-spaced and can be read for hours. The authors are very thorough throughout the book. What I like a lot about this textbook, is that the authors will tell you what they are about to talk about and how it relates, before discussing a particular topic. It isn't choppy like most text books, the sentences are very coherent and easily flowing. The book also contains everyday examples and statistics sprinkled around to keep the viewer tuned in. In all honesty, Research Methods is going to be dry regardless of the author-but I really like how this book was put together! My respects to the authors."
1,DISAPOINTING!!,"The idea behind the book is great, but the book itself fails to meet expectations. The description on Native American life seemed superficial and like it had no experience or research behind it. The charachters were good, but the whole book seemed like a rough draft.The story never went into enough detail. It jumped from one event to another without ever spending enough time on each event to interest me.My advice is to skip it."
5,"A tragic story, magnificently written","This is the story of another tragic episode involving a Native American tribe. That this probably happened under other circumstances, and happened to more than the Arapaho tribe, cannot be doubted. This is another in a series that has given us insight into tribal life and continues to leave us wanting more. The characters are strong, believable, and you want the best for all of them. The underlying plot--selling tribal babies and telling their parents they died--is heartbreaking. The reunion of one such child with her father made me weep. And Vicki's trial reconciliation with Ben gave me hope. This is a great work, written with deep feeling."
3,Useful for undergraduate students,"The book shows the different topics about operations management with several excercises and mini-cases. The mini-cases are not so complex. These mini cases are designed for tools applications but don't help to build a business system concept or a bussiness problem, something very important for MBA students. That is the reason because this book is appropiate for undergraduate students in Bussiness or as a complement material for graduate students.Also, the book needs to improve the explanation of process choice or process tipology, both for goods and services. It is something confuse.I have the spanish edition book with a software (POM) in a CD included. This software has some applications as forecasting, linear programming, proyect management, mrp, among others,in a simple format. But POMS for Windows (H.Weiss), DS for Windows(H.Weiss) and HOM software have more modules and let you try more complex situations."
2,Sally isn't quite the swashbuckler she appears to be.,"The quality of the costume wasn't quite what I had expected for the price I paid. The material is pretty thin and flimsy and the sizing of the pants runs extremely small. I wear a size 8 to 10, and the ""supposed size 12"" was incredibly tight. I wasn't impressed by the costume."
2,Spaceship Eyes - 'Truth In The Eyes Of A Spaceship' (Cleopatra),"Shaceship Eyes is the side project of former Melting Euphoria keyboardist Don Falcone. One of his other efforts, Spirits Burning - 'New Worlds By Design' is SO much better (see my review). I decided to give this disc another listen because I know several others that actually like 'Truth In The Eyes Of A Spaceship' far more than I do. A so-so trance / electronic release I thought,at best. Had a couple of decent tracks to boot,like ""Mind The Alien"", ""The Great Yew Hedge"" (with guest Harvey Bainbridge) and ""We Need A Volunteer"" was okay. You might enjoy it more than I did."
2,Hard to read,"I had this for a topics class in college. The book had great articles, written by many scholars. However, there was no common bond pulling the book together. No overall theme, and each article was painstakingly hard to comprehend. Works better when supplemented with knowledge of the collapse event before reading the article. In that it fails as a stand alone book. Maybe it could have had an overview of the chapter topic or civilization, before outlining specific theory."
4,"Very odd, but effective documentary","I bought this DVD on a whim and I was pleasantly surprised. The documentary provides an in-depth look into the dying world of the sideshow. The best parts for me were the interviews with former sideshow performers while the worst parts were the cheesy sideshow re-enactments and transitions from topic to topic.I was left wishing for more old footage of sideshows, but the footage they did show was amazing.The documentary treats the performers with respect and compassion while not omitting the unusual lives they had.The sequence of the ""monkey woman"" and her romance with the ""lizard man"" was surprisingly moving and should bring many people to tears.If anything, this documentary brought a new awareness to me regarding people born with unusual physical deformities."
5,An amazing movie about amazing people,"In today's Politically Correct climate it might be shocking to see that people, unlike you or me, are so much like you and me. People that today would be forced to stay at home and do nothing but collect a government check, where celebrities and made decent livings. This is an excellent documentary on the amazing world of the American Sideshow."
5,Very Cool!,"I enjoyed this video. The DVD was very interesting and presented Sideshows the way they meant to be....not a freak show but a good job and great profession! I showed this video to 12 year olds. It held their attention and they seemed to like it as well. If you have any interest in this topic, you may enjoy it as well!"
4,It's well enough.,"This is a good book, but I think there is a push for the COMLEX Level 2-PE at my medical school. If you are thinking of getting it for the COMLEX and not for class, I'd skip it. Get the COMLEX review book. Nevertheless, for my HnP class, it was well written and organized."
5,A classic,Happy to have this classic on my shelf. Recommended as one of the most romantic movies of all time. Now I see why
2,No WPA despite advertising,"I got this wireless card from somewhere else for 29.99 and free shipping. It installed easily enough, but the quickstart instructions and the help files are not great. I finally got it to recognize my home wireless network. However, despite what ASUS says on their website, the product does not have WPA security built into the software. At the ASUS website, one can download additional software for WPA security functionality, but it is a third party program (Odyssey Client) which is not compatible with the ASUS software, and whose instructions are less clear than income tax forms instructions. I fiinally gave up and uninstalled Odyssey Client, and now only use WEP encryption.If you want off the shelf WPA security in a wireless card, do not buy this card."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED $ ON THIS!!!,"I've owned 2 of these. After 3 months, the second one is shot again. The motor is too weak to support the primary funtion of this tool, which is to mix oil, a heavier liquid than vinegar, so when you mix your vinaigrette, it's putting too much pressure on the GIZMO. The invention is a great idea, but it should be plugged into an electrical outlet. APPLICA, which supposedly fixes these - doesn't anymore - I was told to get it recycled, end of story. PLEASE, do not purchase this or any other battery operated mixer. THEY GIVE OUT IN NO TIME!"
2,pills too big for me,I like the oil better than the pills. Love Dr.Udo's and use it for everyone in my family daily. I prefer the 3-6-9 oil blend with DHA in its liquid form that you drizzle over food.
2,Disappointing,"As a self-professed non-fan of PSU football, I'm not sure why Mr. Bracken wrote this book. Reading it, I get the feeling he *had* to write these PSU football articles because he worked for the local newspaper. Some of Mr. Bracken's articles have historical information which may be useful, but overall it's not very entertaining or interesting, even for the fans. There are many books on PSU football, some of the best are written by one of its biggest fans - the coach."
2,"A BOOK FOR BEGINNERS OR NEW EMPLOYEES, NOT THE EXPERIENCED","Having been in the veterinary field for 10 years now, I found the book to be way too basic (and a little sappy for my tastes). However, I think it would be a good source for someone just starting out in the veterinary field. This book may also be useful for an experience person starting at a new hospital as the book contains worksheets for the reader (a.k.a. the new person) to fill out regarding hospital policies (for vaccines, lab testing, surgical appts, etc.). These completed worksheets could provide a quick reference to new employees (whether filled out by the new person as a learning experience or prepared by the office manager/head receptionist and provide to all new employees)."
1,NO GOOD AT ALL,"YOUNGSTOWN DEBUT SINGLE ""I'LL BE YOUR EVERYTHING"" IS WORTH NOTHING.IT SOUNDS LIKE 3 LITTLE GIRLS.I SAW THEM IN CONCERT AND THEY CAN'T SING.THIS SINGLE ALSO HAS CLIPS FROM THEIR UPCOMING ALBUM LIKE ""WHENEVER YOU NEED ME"" AND ""LET'S ROLL"".DON'T BUY THIS SO CALLED ""CD SINGLE""."
2,"Annoying, Shameful and disgusting","I first heard this song when Youngstown came to perform at my school, some promotional thing...anyways, the song is kinda bland, annoying and too dumb for its own good. I gave it the extra two stars since they did the Disney concert with my favourite group, Steps. Listen to me-don't buy this-get a Hepburn import, a Steps import, an S Club 7 import, Adam Rickitt import or a Westlife import instead. That's real music. It's shameful, ANOTHER boy band making it. But I must admit, Dallas is nice, nice guy. (After my blabbing to him about Steps being my absolute fave group and that I couldn't believe that I was meeting someone who would be performing with the,) Props to him!-but sorry once again-bad, BAD song....don't get it! I have their autograph, but will most likely give it away for a Westlife poster."
5,YOUNGSTOWN IS BY FAR THE BEST BOY BAND EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok, inspite of my hotts for Dc or David from the group who may I say is absolutly gorgous, I love their song ""I'll be your everything"" I only wish they were singing it to me. I am a teen girl and I was babysitting one night.They insisted on watching The little mermaid that night and that night also happened to be the world premeire of ""I'll be your everything"".At the moment the song ended I called my TWIN SISTER and told her all about it. That is currently our fav song and group, I have both of their singles, and I have posters of them all over. KEEP IT UP GUYZ!"
5,Excellent!,"This single is great, with little bits of sounds from the movie, Inspector Gadget. Although it doesn't let you know, there are three samples from their upcoming record, Pedal to the Steel, Whenever You Need Me, and Through Your Eyes. The whole Cd is great, and I think that Youngstown is going to do great in their career!"
5,Incredible. Sexy. Good Beat. Makes you want to dance.,"This is a great song. Has a good beat with a real catchy tune. The boys are sexy, clean and wholesome. Can't wait to see more of them and hear more of their songs."
3,"It's sub-humanoid,like something from...Inspector Gadget.","It's sub-humanoid,like something from...Inspector Gadget"
5,First-rate,"This is a first-rate collection of mathematical puzzles, from the very easy to the quite difficult. The book is divided into chapters, which usually begin with some discussion of techniques for solving a particular class of puzzles. It stays away from the super-difficult category. As such this book is for nearly everyone, not just those who want to prove their puzzle-solving skill."
2,not very realistic or educational,The puzzle should have the planets' names indicated and placed in proper relationship to each other
5,Adorable !,"My 8 yr. old daughter loves this book, she reads it all the time. She particularly likes the cute, funny characters that Milo encounters in his search for a best friend then to end up finding a very special friend that is always near. We can't wait for the next Milo adventure."
5,How easy it is to talk to God,"Wonderfully illustrated by Andrea Karcic, Milo With A Halo is Lisa Umina's engaging and highly recommended story for young readers about a little animal named Milo who informs God that he is going try and find out who he can consider to be his best friend. The story is utterly charming and young readers will discover how easy it is to talk to God about such things -- and to find in the end that God is truly any child's best friend."
4,Chimera Stone,"Our reluctant hero is named Peirol. He is a Dwarf, a jeweler, and a thief. A Wizard sends him on a quest for a 'Chimera' or an unrealizable dream that is called ""The Empire Stone"". To possess the Stone is to become like a God. Our hero lives in a brutal world with slavery, wars, thieves, and human sacrifice. Peirol travels on his quest paying his way with his wits and with some of the enchanted gems that he trades. Periol really has to use his wits once in possession of the ""unrealizable Dream""."
2,Didn't like it very much,"I was surprised about the 5 star ratings this book got. To each their own I guess. I didn't enjoy this book because I just did not like the heroine. She spends practically the entire book being rude to the hero, but she sleeps with him over and over again. And cries after each time. I was completely disgusted by her and wondered what the guy saw in her. She senses she is in danger but stupidly puts herself in bad situations over and over again. Frankly, this is not a character I can respect. He loves her inspite of everything, but I wished he didn't waste his love on this woman. I don't like this author much and this book was the last nail in the coffin."
3,Good reading,Good reading as usual . A little slow but when it starts it ok. Not one of her bests. Good
3,Not Cerrone at his best,"In my opinion, the most fun track here is ""Not Too Shabby"". I don't really like the other tracks. In those tracks, Cerrone makes a departure from what had been his style. Don't get me wrong, those tracks may be good objectively speaking; nevertheless, this album hardly turns me on. When I first heard this album I was struck by disappointment. Fortunately, this feeling vanished when, shortly afterwards, I heard his next album - Cerrone vii (""You Are The One"")."
3,Limited variation of designs,"Yes - another coloring book review by me, but necessary in regards to this one. I was excited to try this one out as I love geometric designs and was pleased at the price available from one of the sellers through Amazon. One I got it I decided to try a few out and was pleased with the results of my artwork...then I examined the book closer. I found that there were only 12 designs and four of each, thus making the 48 pages of the coloring book! I felt disappointed, even though I could easily vary each image with different colors and patterns. The paper was of better quality than many other coloring books so that was a plus. But I wish I had known that there were only 12 different designs as other reviewers didn't mention this nor in the description of the book. I do recommend using quality colored pencils in order to get the most of your work - you will be happier with what you produce if you do!"
2,too small,If you do one page you cannot do the other as the markers leak through to other side. The other side of the pages should be blank.
4,Great book,This book was purchased for my Ed 34 class at Brooklyn College. I actually had one of the authors as my professor. Professor Lopez. Great book showing in detail what it is to grow up and live in a multicultural city. Also pretty funny. Great recommended reading.
4,76 year old Grandma learns to shoot Pool,"Yes Grandma can learn a new game, mine did with the help of Byrne's video tape. The video explains all the basics of shooting pool and gives a review of each segment so you can get the important points firmly in mine before the next topic. Once he gets past the bare basics the really good info is presented which is helpful to the beginner as well as the intermediate player.If you want to improve your game or just understand the dynamics of Billiards buy this tape."
5,3rd of 3 in Smithsonian's Lead Belly Legacy series,"(70') This is the third of three volumes in the Smithsonian's Lead Belly Legacy series, probably the best set for just listening to Lead Belly play and sing. All three CDs are taken from Moses Asch's original studio masters (as opposed to most other available compilations on reprint labels, which are made from secondary sources); the other two are Vol. 1 ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night"" SF40044 (67'), and Vol. 2 ""Bourgeois Blues"" SF40045 (72'). As usual, the Smithsonian provides extensive and authoritative notes; the notes for this Vol. 3 also include a complete song listing of Lead Belly song titles on their various CDs, but unfortunately it doesn't distinguish between the few duplications issued, versus different recordings of the same song."
4,GEAT CAMISOLE FRON AMAZON,THIS CAMISOLE IS A PERFECT FIT. THE MATERIAL FEELS GOOD NEXT TO THE SKIN. IT REALLY LOOKS NICE UNDER SHEER TOPS. IT WAS A GOOD PURCHASE PRICE.
4,Vanity Fair Women's Satin Glance Adjustable Strap Camisole #17701,"It's a standard, but does not come in black or other colors. The straps tend to unadjust. The silky texture allows clothes to fall better."
2,SMALL Sizes,Wow it sure depressed me trying this on. I ordered the same size as the rest of my clothes - but couldn't squeeze into it. Maybe it's a junior size?
2,Not great,"The camisole is smaller than sized. Looked far better in pictures. Sizing needs more work. The fabric is okay, just."
4,The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe Review by spicywind27,"Okay, so this book isn't the best I have read, in fact, at times it lmost put me to sleep, but I think overall Mr. Staples did a very good job writting this book. I thought I would hate it, but it turns out it isn't bad. It's actually pretty good."
5,Michael Datcher do ur thang!!!,"I thought Raising Fences was nothing but humourous, poetic and reflective. I'm proud of Michael Datcher for writing such a strong realistic book which other people can relate to. In my opinion if you've read the book and didn't like it, that's you but don't hate on a brotha trying to succeed! Michael keep doing your thang brotha because through my eyes you've already succeeded!And that's my review!!!"
5,Loved this book!,"This may be written from a black man's perspective, but it resonated with me (a white woman) as well. His writing is so emotionally compelling, I wanted to help through his dilemmas. I wanted him to help me through mine as well. Mostly, I just accepted the incredible gift of language and poetry that he shared in this book. My favorite lines are the ones he uses to describe what he needs to be happy. ""I'm not looking for a perfect person, I'm looking for a perfect match. A coworker to build my picket fence."" I hope we all find that match."
4,A wonderful read.,"I read the book for my reading group and it was a great read. I picked it up and, like most of the other reviewers, I just kept reading. I'm not a big fan of poetry (it's an art form I have not understood or embraced), but his writing vacilates between wonderful imagery and monologues to fairly pedestrian dialogue. He would mix incredible poetic cadences with wooden and stilted writing that, I don't think, the two always married well from the ""novel"" point of view (even though the story is autobiographical). Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the book. I got a sense that by the end of the novel, he was still searching (hoping?) for the picket fence. Or, at the very least, he was now on his way."
3,Nicely told,"This story was definitely amazing! I thought the writing was a bit awkward in the beginning, but the author's honesty and openness kept me reading. The story is nothing like I envisioned. It is indeed ""A Black Man's Love Story"". I really enjoyed sharing in the highs and lows he outlined so transparently. Now, I must read Resurrecting Mingus!!!!!"
4,"""A go getter""","this book is a; to me that you would never think a man would write ,and yes i did mean it when i said that the book is a go getter.And I think anybody that reads this review should really consider reading this book.And i am willing to read another book by Michael Datcher."
4,Raising Fences is Needed,I have worked with rural youth on an Indian Reservation. I see many patterns with minority children as with Mr. Datcher's book. We need to know the proper insight on helping not documenting. Black America is a reflection and an unfortunant leader in the principles of poverty and confused justice. I feel this book is a good read in the fact it represents all miniority's who face fatherless situations.
5,Excellent!,"I finished this book in two days. As a 40 year old divorced black woman, mother of a 15 year son and sister to 6 brothers, I found Mr. Datcher gave great insight as to how black men think & feel - not the way WE think they think & feel.The whole experiences of growing up fatherless; peer pressures; surviving the streets; first sexual experiences; almost repeating the cycle of becoming a father out of wedlock in a loveless relationship to finding real, true, life-sharing, deep, committed love will keep you hooked. I loved the raw, heart-breaking honesty of the poetry during 'open-mike' nights @ the poetry club! I would love to give a copy of this book to each of my brothers - this is highly recommended read!!!"
5,Illuminating and Thought Provoking,"I am an African-American woman who prides herself on being informed and racially conscious. However, this book gave me a more in depth understanding of the difficulties faced by black men. Because of our reluctance to discuss the less positive aspects of life in our community, we do not address issues like fatherlessness. Michael Datcher makes it clear that boys who grow up without fathers are at terrible risk of acting out under the most negative types of peer pressure. He also discusses the choices and habits that far too many black women engage in that have terrible consequences for them and their children. Of course these are very emotional and complex issues, but we must not shirk our responsibility to address them as best we can. Raising Fences is a must read."
3,Maybe next time...,"While enjoyable in its own right, I think that This Time pales in comparison with both Kiko and Colossal Head. The only two songs that stand out in my mind after repeated listenings is the laid back pop/soul of ""This Time"" (the title track) and the fuzzed out riffing of ""Viking."" It's nice to hear more songs sung in Spanish, but none are quite as memorable as Colossal Head's ""Marciela."" If you're new to Los Lobos and are looking for a good introduction to the band, this ain't it. In my humble opinion, this album lacks the groove, beauty, and sheer variety of their best work."
2,"Los Lobos, but not at their best","In ""This Time"" Los Lobos build on the bluesy sound they developed in ""Monster Head"" and that David Hidalgo continued in his side-project ""Houndog."" The overpowering bass thump and harsh, clanging guitars are back, but this time with a bit more melody. ""This Time"" is mostly blues with a few Latino flavored tracks mixed in, none of it very exciting. If you liked ""Monster Head"" you'll probably like this too, so give it a shot; but if you remember the fabulous sounds of Los Lobos from ""How Will The Wolf Survive"" and ""By The Light Of The Moon"" you may find their newest release a disappointment, as I did."
3,"Hard-edged, but not quite solid","Always followed this band through the years and at first, I liked the electric blues feel. But then it seemed the songs are too short, ideas that show promise are never finished. Still, it is one of their best, if not the best. It took a while to get into it, but I have no regrets! La Nancy"
2,Not the best performance of Scott Joplin's work.,"I'm sure Mr. Thompson is a fine pianist, but on this CD, he seems a bit ham-fisted. I have the uneasy feeling that his timing is just slightly off on many selections, and he seems to make a number of blunders on each piece."
1,Rampant errors,"The first reviewer is correct; there are careless spelling and grammar errors everywhere. Just read through the first chapter to get an idea. Not only does this make the book highly unprofessional, but it also makes it nearly impossible to learn because one is constantly distracted.In addition, while I realize that this isn't the fault of the publisher or authors, this book is not suitable for the graduate level. It is much too elementary for the advanced learner."
1,very disappointed,We should have returned this item as we had to make adjustments to many of the doors. We did not receive the same size hinges in the order. Would not order these online again. Live and learn!
5,A Passage Through Bombay,"A delicious book. A stunning debut. Manil chooses an average apartment in an average neighborhood as a port hole into the vast Indian lower middle class. He works in the rich tapestry of Indian culture and daily lore with great efficiency for a modest book. There are no complex plots, deep thoughts or messeges. Hindu gods, slum lords, social taboos, Muslim neighbors and even the obsession with Guinness records are paraded through. To top it off, Manil Suri also delivers all this in an comedy style which is highly entertaining. I hope there is more to come."
5,Extraordinary and life affirming.,"This is the most compelling book I have read in years. Simply extraordinary....The other reviews provide a synopsis - I will just tell you if you read with an open mind, the book will rock you!"
4,From the heart of Mumbai,"The thing that impressed me the most was the use of English as spoken by people in the middle class family of India. It may be hard on some people who have not been brought up in such an environment. I specifically liked the duels between Mrs. Asrani and Mrs. Pathak that stemmed from the socio-lingual structure of the Mumbai society. The plot that is woven out of the daily lives of simple souls is indeed very realistic. Mr Suri deserves the credit for excellent character protrayal of each character in the novel, whether it was the Tall Ganga or Vishnu himself. At times I think the mythology part was a bit too much and hard to corelate. Overall, it is an excellent novel to read."
3,review of death of vishnu,"I generally enjoyed the book, though I would have appreciated a glossary of the Indian terms and words used in it. Some, I could figure out; some I could find in a standard dictionary, but some I could not find even in on-line dictionaries. I may read one and perhaps both of the other books of this trilogy, when they are complete, but not right away, as this one was a bit tiresome, almost mentally exhausting, in parts, especially much of the spiritual and dream imagery. In sum, I am glad that I read it. Hopefully, the other two books will tie up some of the loose ends left dangling in this book. I saw the author on the University of Maryland cable channel. The interview encouraged me to buy the book, Kindle edition, and to keep looking for other works by him."
5,fantastic and powerful,Great read. Interesting characters and well tied together. Explores some religion/caste issues and brings India to life. Intriguing imagery.
2,"Great beginning, tedious ending","The story started with pop and sizzle, and then just fizzled. It seemed to lose focus halfway through, and then just dawdled and meandered to the finish. I can't recommend it, unless you have a particular interest in this genre."
3,Confusing,"I could not tell you what this story is about, even though I have read the entire book.What I can tell you is that Mr. Suri's writing is exquisitely descriptive. It has a very poetic feel to it. The author also does a believable job of breathing life into his characters. And his descriptions of the town, the streets, the weather bring the reader right down to earth.I wish this story had made sense to me. I was rather confused throughout, and often forgot who was doing what and when... new characters are introduced sporatically and this disrupts the plot. Maybe this was the author's intention?I would recommend this book if you can't find anything else to read."
2,Die Vishnu die,This was a really really really bad book. None of the characters had any redeeming values and it made me not really care what happened. I was expecting all sorts of metaphors involving Hindu religion to be revealed but they never did...
2,Interesting but contrived,"The deliberateness of the plot makes the story contrived. I was also disappointment by the rather poor understanding of the mythological basis of Hindu beliefs that formed the underpinnings of the novel. I read somewhere that Mr Suri is learning Indian mythology thru Penguin translations. This is not the way to do it. These translations are literal, they don't capture the spirit behind the originals.-Sam"
2,Awkward Frist Novel,"I could not wait to finish this novel. Suri has a very interesting concept behind his book, but I do not think he pulled it off. The characters all had colorful backgrounds, but the flashbacks into their past felt more like a historical dictation and less like storytelling. Vishnu's past with Padmini is a flop. I couldn't tell you what the significance of that was except that he wanted what he could not have. I didn't understand Mr. Jalal's deal, either, and what the impact of it was, nor was it believable that he was going through a spiritual rebirth. I liked Mrs. Asrani and Mrs. Pathak a lot. These two bickering neighbors who could not get along created some very entertaining conflict. As for the writing, I think Suri tries way too hard to evoke drama, rather than allow the drama to speak for itself. I did not enjoy reading this book, but that is not to say I wouldn't give Suri another try if he wrote a second."
4,"Beautiful, but sad story","On the steps of a Bombay apartmentVishnu, a servant, a handyman, lies dying.The story shifts from Vishnu's remembrances of the past to each of the apartment dwellers and then to Vishnu's dying thoughts. Vishnu is ignored by the others as much as possible, but becomes an embarrassment as his dying grows more and more prolonged and more and more messy.The book's strength, to me, was in its focus on both the sensuality of life and the casual acceptance of the horrors of life."
1,Boring,"I'll be brief - started out fairly well. As I turned each page I cared less and less about any of it. Didn't tell me anything about indian culture - which I find very interesting. Give me Salman any day over this. Indian ""very lite"" - not worth the time nor $."
1,Not good,This book follows the lives of several families in a Bombay apartment building as a homeless man in the stairwell dies. This book has few good points. There are several sexually explicit scenes. I do not recommend it.
2,2nd time not the charm,"This was a highly dissapointing follow-up to a shockingly good debut. In short, after the first chapter...it was all down-hill from there.The story of a head-strong girl comming of age during India's partition and her disasterous marriage are simply new clothes on an old empress-how many times have we read this tale? The convoluted Father/Daughter relationship lays the groundwork for the incestuous Mother/Son incident that is (yawn) the pivitol point of the book.The charactors are flat and very few take on a life outside the page. It became clear,after the middle, that the author was having a hard time trying to sustain the voice of a female protagonist. The voice becomes shrill, repetative and whining- a real bore to read and even the son fails to arouse sympathy within the framework of the tale.Better luck elsewhere...."
2,Too many vocabulary words,"I was so excited to read this book. I thought it would give me some insight into Indian culture. I did get almost halfway thorugh before I gave up. Obviously he wrote for his Indian audience. But for Joe or Jane American, unless you like looking up vocabulary words all the time, it's cumbersome. Mercifully, there is a glossary in the back, but any novel that needs PAGES of glossary is not a joy to read, it felt more like school work--having to refer back there sometimes several times on a single page of text. And several words were not included. After a while, I just gave up. I only hope this is made into a movie...the story was great, just didnt have the patience with all the unfamiliar words...."
5,Biscuit always makes the day,My 5 year old loves to read Biscuit books. They are easy to follow and read on her own and the pictures are great.
3,Cute story but didn't like the barking!,Okay...so the story line is cute for the biscuit series but almost every page you have to bark impersonating biscuit the dog and I really got tired of that. My daughter (22months old) seemed to like it so I'll keep reading it to her and eventually maybe she will take over the impersonating!
3,book is great seller unreliable,"the book is great. The seller,skmfg1234, however is totally unreliable. I was promised shippin between Aug 30- Sep1. It's 11 days past that range and still no delivery. So much for getting it as a birthday gift. My advice DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM SKMFG1234."
5,Catholic Youth Bible,This bible is wonderful for teaching teens in religious education class. I like the descriptions and prayers that are part of this bible. I would highly recommend this bible to anyone for teens and younger.
5,excellent choice,this is an excellent bible for catholic teens! well designed with tons of question and answer pages and how biblical teachings can be applied to real life! I definitely recommend!
2,Disappointing at best,"Not the best of anything in this version, a poor translation and shallow offering. It's as if no one understands the words or emotions they are supposed to be portraying, including the director and translator. Susanna played by Rossana Potenza is overacting at its worst. Her exaggerated facial contortions and arm waving make it difficult to get through the first act. Particularly difficult to watch if you do historical reproduction, as the sets, props, and costumes all fall short to a critical eye. Hold out for a better version."
2,Lackluster performance,"I'm a singer by avocation. We performed this opera last season. I wanted to see a performance of it for reference. It was OK, but not great."
4,"Tiny, read but classic",Read the dimensions carefully. Its tiny but can be won as a pendant. The color is lighter than I had hoped for but it looks classic.
5,"Quality production, highly entertaining","No Wiggles here, but lots of excellent singing and dancing from Dorothy and friends. The dialogue is often paced a little slow, even by kids' standards, but the musical bits are fantastic and little ones love them. The production is on par with the Wiggles' best DVDs, such as ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"" and ""Wiggly Wiggly World."""
4,very interesting presentation of the growth of a teenage gir,"I enjoyed the novel very much. It reflects with a crude reality the changes a girl has to undergo in order to achieve maturity. The imaginative world she creates and the neccesity to belong to someone or something is deeply moving. I would like to see what other people think of the novel, especially, the characterization of Frankie Addams."
4,Very Interesting,"This book was one of the best on my list. It was easy to understand, the only fault I foud was that it didn't have much of a story to it. I enjoyed reading it anyway and I feel that many people can relate to Frankie."
3,A Great Piece of Symbolic Literature,"Frankie's struggle with existence throughout McCuller's novel may have appeared a bit dramatic, but in reality it conveys the typical teenage/adolescent experience of feeling awkward and lacking a sense of belonging in the world, which I recognized as the key theme. The fact that her over-powering physical growth greatly conflicted with her immature inner-growth of emotions added to her struggle. She was reluctant in accepting the fact that she was on the verge of entering adolescence, bordering on the fine line between the innocent, yet confusing age twelve to the more mature age of thirteen. It was interesting how McCuller was able to incorporate both drama and humor in her novel, both of which had a lasting effect on the outcome of the story. I enjoyed this novel, as I was able to relate to it's symbolic portrayal of the emotional maturation process that each individual experiences at one time or another during his or her life."
4,absolutely charming,"I thought this play was very well written and it had such a wonderful portrayal of a twelve year old girl, nicely done!"
3,The teen angst of a bored Frankie Adams to find her calling.,It was a fairly decent book with fascinating characters.But it dragged on a bit long about Frankie Adams tamptrums.
2,Undeserving of its place in american literature,This book is one of the books of the twentieth-century cannon whose reputation I find underserved. The slow pace of the book and its annoying lead character are its two main faults. They work in conjunction to create a book that is neither an enjoyable nor a memorable experience.
1,The worst book I ever TRIED to read,"So I didn't actually finish the book. I was only able to get through 20 pages of it, which took me 4 hours because I kept falling asleep as I read it. Hmmmm... I think that says enough about the boredom level I reached."
3,"Depressing, but worthwhile","This book presents a very bleak view of coming-of-age with a style that seems to be deliberately suggestive of a child's nightmare. The prose is impressionistic, almost dizzyingly so at times. The plot isn't much to brag about, but I suppose she wasn't going for plot. It was worth reading once, but I don't think I'll come back to it too often.(As an aside, the reviewer who claimed it was unrealistic that a soldier might try to pick up a 12-year-old girl irritated me a little bit. First of all, some soldiers simply do want 12-year-old girls--just ask some of the folks in the Phillipines, Japan, Okinawa, Vietnam etc. Secondly, McCullers makes it abundantly clear that F. Jasmine is taller and looks older than she is. I'm not sure how anyone could've missed that.)"
2,Not very good at all,"A very boring book, cousin's death not needed at all ,and read only to do book report on. Better than some ,but worse than most"
4,What it Means to Grow Up,Few books capture youth as well as this. Frankie is as true as she is beautifully crafted. This is a tremendous work.
3,This was a great piece of writing,I enjoyed reading this book.The aurthor Carson Mccullers gives you such detailed describtion leading to a wonderful image.
1,Terrible,"This is probably one of the worse books I ever read. The plot was totally undeveloped and it kept changing tones. Whatever, McCuller was trying to portray was totally useless information. The book was terrible and I would not want to recommend this book to anyone unless they wanted to really wanted to waste some time!"
1,Most uninteresting book i have ever read,"I believe this book to be the most uninteresting book i have ever read. This books plot is missing and if it is ther somewhere its very unorganized. The characters' moods are not conveyed to the readers except for Frankie's. The author describes all of the scenes very well except she doesnt need to because most of them are the same, the kitchen. It's fine that the kitchen is the main backdrop for the story such as the water pump in the miracle worker. But every time you go into the kitchen it's the same why spend and entire page in your novel talking about the same thing you told us 10 pages ago. The only reason i didnt quit after the first 20 pages is because I had to be a critique of a book and i was running out of time to read. I kept thinking it has to get better at some point, but i was wrong it was the most boring book i have ever read."
1,Horrible Book,"This book is simply terrible. I had to read it for summer reading, but this book is simply awful. It's now collecting dust upon my bookshelf, where it shall remain for quite some time. This book is all about a messed-up Frankie Addams, who goes through three phases of her life, including going by different names. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Sure it has a theme, but the plot is terrible and the girl is clearly in need of mental help. Seriously, she uses knives to get splinters out of her feet, threatens to throw knives at people, insists that her brother take her on the HONEYMOON (!!!) and allow herself to live with his wife and himself, starts to date at the age of 12, drinks at the age of 12 and hits her date over the head with a water pitcher. But to each their own. If you wish to read the book, go ahead and knock yourself out!"
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I read this book because it was on the Publishing Triangle's List of 100 Best Lesbian and Gay Novels. It was the first time I'd read McCullers and her writing style, her ability to put together a beautiful sentence, is fantastic. The story reminded me of unhappy, subdued, female-character based version of Ray Bradbury's _Dandelion Wine_. However, I found the end of the story abrupt and out of character with the rest of the story: 100+ pages of slow story telling then a jump into the future for the ending, which comprises all of 3 pages. However if you are looking for glbt content, it is not really here; sure, Frankie is a tomboy, but that is as close as the story comes to glbt content."
1,"Shallow, overated, worn out theme of ""Coming of Age""","This is the first book we have read by Carson McCullers and we were disapointed by the lack of action. Through McCuller's lack of in-depth analysis of Frankie's problems, the plot grew increasingly tedious. The kitchen discussions with Bernice, the cook, were insufficient to resolve Frankie's inner conflict. The novel seemed extremey unorganized, constantly jumping around, maing the reader's perception of time completely incoherent. Perhaps McCullers' other works are not as disappoitning, however, we were not pleased with Memebr of the Wedding."
1,Ewwww....,"I'm sorry, but after reading this book I just wanted to throw it against the wall. Frankie is so annoying that I could barely keep myself from ripping the pages apart. Frankie was an annoying and obnoxious brat who had no cares for anyone but herself. And where did her cousins death come from? It was just thrown in there for obviously no point! If I could give this book no stars I would...."
2,Maybe I wasn't paying attention,"but this book didn't seem to have much point. The dialogue was interesting and amusing on several occasions, but when I got to the end I suspected my copy of the book was missing some pages. That was not the case. The book was just over and I was quite disappointed that I spent any time reading this one."
3,Not my favorite book ever.,"Not my favorite book ever. It was alright. Maybe because I have to do such an in depth reading of it, it made me a bit wary - I don't know."
4,easy to do on own,Dealer wanted $110. I did it on my own with this and 20 minutes of youtube where someone showed me how. Easy. Cheaper than dealer. I did notice a difference in air quality.
5,Fits 2008 Accord 4cyl,This is a good fit and easy to change. I should have changed the dirty filter a long time ago. It took less than two minutes.
4,Nice Product!,"The WIX cabin filter seems to be a solid product. When compared with the Honda OEM filter, I can tell no difference. After installing the new filter, that strange stale air smell that I had been experiencing went right away....clearly I need to replace my filter more often! :)Overall, I would see no reason to not purchase this filter again. It came packaged well, arrived fast and took 30 seconds to install in my 2006 Honda Accord Coupe.Good Luck!"
5,One of the easiest DIY maintenance out there,"The air filter shipped fast and fit my 2007 V6 Accord perfectly. The install took less than a minute and I could tell a difference right away. The musty smell from the old filter was gone and if I took it to the dealer to do the same, they would have charge me 49.99. Talk about markup!"
3,Filter for Honda,"It makes noise. It is in my wife's Honda Civic. It is cheaper than at the dealer, no questions about it!"
2,decent,The filter definitely fits my 2009 honda civic. This filter works and gets the job done; however it is VERY flimsy. I rather pay the extra 3-4 dollars for the Frame breeze filter which feels like more effort was spend on the design of the filter. This filter seriously feels like a few layers of coffee filters. For the price that this company charges I do not think it was worth the $14.50 since another filter which is better built is about the same price.
5,Perfect fit,Fit our 2008 Honda Accord like a glove. Quality filter and 1/10th the cost of having the dealer do the job.
5,fits 2010 Accord 4cyl perfectly,"Great fit, and super easy to install. Can't imagine anyone paying a dealer 1/2 hour of labor to install something that takes 5 minutes to install. I think I spent more time getting everything out and back into my glove box than I did unhooking the glove box and installing this filter."
4,Cheaper than the Dealer,This item replaces factory filter The dealer wanted $50.00 to replace the filter. I did it myself for less than $10.
5,2009 MDX & TL application,I installed these on my 2008 Acura mdx & TL. They are oem quality as to be expected from wix. Fit and finish was better than the purolaters they replaced and I will be ordering these annually as long as amazon continues to carry them.
5,Just Right,This product fit in my Honda Civic EX Sedan no problem! Make sure you connect it in the slots on either side so air doesn't escape. My AC is working better than ever!
1,Honda Cabin Filter,This filter does not fit may 2004 Accord EX (4 CYL). There is a filter under my glove box and it looks like a diaper that snaps into the plastic removal cover. This product was not even close to being the correct filter.
2,good film but the quality was horrible,"good film but the quality was horrible. film was bad with the pixelation. I actually wanted to buy the film because i'm a designer, but didn't have that option."
3,Lots of potential but light on substance,A fascinating topic with the viewer being guided on screen by various experts and hobbyists. Ultimately the movie was a tad superficial despite the enthusiasm of the narrators.
5,"A Must See, especially for anyone in the printing business","I stumbled across this movie quite by accident and am really glad to have seen it. I had no idea how important the Linotype was in advancing the availability of reading materials to so many people. It was also fascinating to learn about it's evolution, starting with a need to make copies of notes to a becoming a working machine. It's so complex it's a miracle that it works at all, but was the cutting edge technology for printing for 80 years. Thankfully there are still a few people interested in perserving a few Linotype machines for the computer generation to learn about. At just over an hour and a quarter, it's a short film, well worth your time to watch."
4,It was very informative,My grandfather was a Linotype operator. I rented the movie to learn more about the profession and the machine. I found the movie very informative and interesting. I did not give it 5 stars because it was slow at times and was a bit repetitive.
3,A mixed rating,"I have mixed praise for this book. I believe its positive attributes lie in the breath of alternative and supporting treatment options for biploar disorder the author discusses. Certainly these are all beneficial and well worth understanding and applying to manager this disorder. To that end I recommend the book highly. My concern lies in the authors implied belief that these are in fact possible alternatives to medication treatment plans; not adjuncts to them, his cautions not withstanding. In the light of the overwhelming research evidence that most patients with bipolar disorder need to be on a life long medication treatment plan this is not only misleading but potentially dangerous. Bipolar patient's have enough trouble trying to stay on medication withtout encouragement to discontinue them based on the errorneous belief the alternative treatment plans discussed in this book will be sufficient. A decision which could have fatal consequences for them."
4,Waiting for a Follow-Up Book,"Paul Wider has done such a fine job with this book that he should soon write another. It has been an honor to participate in this project with him as an editor. Wider has provided such a gift to people who struggle and suffer with this disease. His wit and wisdom, as a fellow sufferer, carries a note that sounds thoroughly convincing thoughout this volume. The ""Tools"" section is especially rewarding. Anyone who cares about someone who deals with depressive illness should read this book."
5,This book goes beyond common sense and that is the TRUTH.,"Depression is a big problem in our society and I believe Paul's book will help those in need. So, if you know anyone who could benefit from the information in this book, please get this book for them. Paul Wider is a good friend of many years and he has always been a sincere, caring and spiritual person. I also purchased a copy of his book with the intention of giving it to someone who I thought might need it. I recommend, before you do give the book to that special someone, read it yourself. The information inside will help you to help someone else."
3,Not Good Enough,I bought this book hoping it would give me insight into why I was feeling depressed. But it didn't. It gave pratical advice and just wasn't good enough.
3,"Useful for what it is, but beware...","it certainly feels to me to be in the ""bad"" Alexander camp. It also seems to me that he tries to understand Alexander by holding him to the mores of our current era. This is not right or wrong, you should just be aware of it. For the record, I'm in the good, but with some flaws, camp as pertains to the Great King."
5,I would say Kick A**,"And so I have.As much as I would like to leave my review just like that I figure you guys/gals would like a little more discriptive phrases other than BUY IT.Suction cup is about the size of a 50 peice.Soot ball is about the size of a baseball on the smallish side.Soot ball is fluffy, well constructed, & squeezable.By ""well constructed"" I mean the eyes aren't glued on or anything like that.There is 2 strings like the picture so it hangs/ balances well.It does have a tendency to ""wind up"" like a pitcher at the mound though, but this could be because I'm only rolling down 1 of my car windows.BUY IT."
1,not what i thought it was,"i had a pen from this company and i was trying to find a replacement because i loved the way it wrote. Well my old pen had a pink gel grip, black ink, and it had an exclamation mark on the top. I knew it was not exactly the same, but being it was roseart in black ink...Well i was wrong, the company was the same, but the pen was the worst i have ever written with. The ink didnt come out smoothly, and i felt that i had to press really hard on the paper to make a line. I woudnt buy it.You'd be better off buying a regular bic pen first."
2,"Very Thin, Not for a man","Unfortunately, I am not savvy about thickness terminology, so I went by the photo. The photo must be magnified by a trillion. ha. This necklace is paper thin, and looks like it will not last long at all. The other reviewers who said they were getting this for a boyfriend? This is not a ""guy"" chain at all. The balls are teeny..it nowhere at all resembles those ""dog-tag"" chain type necklaces if that is what you are looking for. If you are looking for a nice DAINTY chain for a woman, it would be okay. The seller however was nice enough to write me back about a refund (why I gave 2 stars,)but it was Christmas time and I was just too busy, so didn't get it done."
3,"Not Worth the money, but still pretty good","I've been in a fight w/ Apple and Peachpit over this 'new' version of DVDSP4.I'm an Apple cert. instructor for this and other ProApps. When I started reading the new book I found the same mistakes from version 3 had been copied over to version 4.Granted, the new compressor app is great but nowhere does it explain the new features of DVDSP4 like support for external video, VTS editing and the whole HD support. I was told by Apple and Peachpit that this version of the book was intended to be an 'revision' of the old book; however, the general advertising of this book says 'Fully Update' instead of 'Fully Revised'... a bit misleading to the people who thought this version would help instruct students on how to best use the new features. We'll have to wait."
5,great book,I have found this book to be very useful and helpful. I am a film student learning Editing and this was a required book for my first editing class.I love the lessons. Every thing is well written and easy to understand.
2,By the end you'll feel you haven't read anything,"I've read many of Kerouac's works so I understand his writing. I understand the book is a dream journal, I just didn't much care for it. It was a refreshing change from his other works that ""stories""/scenarios ended quickly however by the end of the book, I felt like I had just wasted a lot of time. Some say that this book gives you a better insight into his life, but it's just a dream journal and I walked away not feeling like I gained any insight. I'd skip it unless you're a Kerouac fan and want to read everything he wrote."
1,NEVER RECEIVED ONE SINGLE ISSUE,"This subscription for USA Today was ordered and paid for yet I never received a single issue for over 2 months even though the delivery time was about one month.When I called the Magazine service as instructed by Amazon, I was told that the delivery would be delayed another month. This was unacceptable and I cancelled the subscription. I was told I would receive a refund. I assumed since not one issue was received that I would be refunded the $52.00 I paid. Shortly later I get an e-mail from Amazon the I was refunded only $17.00I e-mailed back and was told to contact the Magazine service. I the responded that I had already done that and I should receive a full refund. That was the last e-mail I sent to Amazon. It's about 3 weeks now and I've still not gotten a reply from Amazon. I'm accepting that I was screwed out of $35...and will never again order a subscription from Amazon."
1,Unreliable Delivery,"Great paper when it arrives, our subscription started a few weeks ago and it's been coming on and off ever since then. Somedays we get the paper, some days we don't. When you call Magazine Express they seem helpful and will offer to call the delivery source to try to find out what the issues are. In the future I'll just order direct from USA Today, it's the same price and you can cut out the problems with the ""middle man""."
2,poor delivery,"LOVE the paper.I buy it everyday (when available next to STARBUCKS)But oftentimes it just wasn't there. once every 7-8 days maybeSo I thought with the subscription it would be better...NOTI must be in a BAD area, San Diego-East Del Mar.I was VERY disappointed and I cancelled after the delievry was even WORSE.They missed at least ONCE a week."
1,"Dumber Than A ""Dummy?""","You have to be far from an Excel ""Dummy"" in order to make good use of this book. It starts out showing you the various shortcuts and tricks that make Excel operate more efficiently, but it does nothing for the person who's knowledge of Excel is limited to booting up the program. My biggest gripe that at no point did it give you a start-up spreadsheet that would allow you to build your knowledge as you went along, using the shortcuts and tips that the book includes, so after you are about 100 pages into the book, you are saying to yourself, ""So, if I want to set up a spreadsheet for my business, what do I put in 'A1'?""My advice is to find someone who knows Excel, pay them the price of the book for an hour of their time, and go from there. You'll learn more in that hour than the entire book will tell you. That is, if you're a ""Dummy"" like me."
2,Rust Farm,"Not bad for their first CD!! The first track is especially good--great guitar and mandolin. The slower songs aren't as good as the ones with a faster, really good beat. Some of the lyrics have a definite Jimmy Buffett feeling--you have to laugh! I was disappointed that one of the songs from the movie ""Limbo"" wasn't included;i.e., ""Loving You Hell Enough For Me""...(and endless well of misery)...etc. Maybe on their next release! They definitely have potential; I'll be watching for their next CD."
5,Penguin Party Lotion Pump,"This product is exactly what i expected, it is exactly as the picture shows, it works great and gets the job done. I love that its life like but is still fun. :)"
4,Easy to Install,"It took me more time to pull the TV away from the wall and dust than it did to install the unit. I have a picture back, and things seem bright. So far so good.I did receive the full unit that is pictured in on the product page. There are several mixed reviews on this product with the buyer either getting just the bulb, the full assembly or something in between. I think the confusion is in how Amazon rotates the sellers on the product. When I added the lamp to my cart, the page said one seller, on the final confirmation screen it said a different seller, and on my final receipt it said yet a third seller. I imagine that the different sellers fulfill the orders however they can. Mine ended up coming from Kennedy Webster Electric. Good luck!"
5,Sony XL-2400 Projection TV Lamp,"So far I haven't had any issues with the lamp, the install was very simple and my TV was up and running as soon as we installed it. It arrived in a timely fashion as well."
1,It's a scam.....,The product doesn't include the housing as the pictures shows. I bought this from samsung parts and they didn't mention it was just the buld without the the housing. It's a rip off be aware.
5,Replacement lamp,"Easy to install, works perfectly, picture looks better than before. Love the pricing, so much lower than buying from major retailer"
1,Sony XL-2400 Replacement Lamp Died after 2-1/2 Months,"This projection TV lamp from LAMP MONSTERS stopped working after only 2-1/2 months. When I ordered it, I did not realize I was getting a 3rd party lamp. I was very disappointed that this lamp died so quickly. Plus, the lamp replacement warning message displayed on the TV did not go away when this lamp with installed. I guess only new lamps from Sony will make the replacement warning message not appear."
1,Lasted less than 6 months.,The product is a genuine Sony item but it must have been on the shelf for years because it has lasted less than 6 months after it was installed and the TV is only used on weekend which is about 300 hours.
2,Poorly remanufactured bulbs....Seller not cooperative,"The bulb performed very poorly compared to other replacement bulbs I have used. This bulb produce a flashing/stobing effect after just 20hrs use. I contacted the seller and they first implied my television must have broken since the last bulb replacement, and that the only recourse for me was a refund, minus shipping and handling.No offer to replace the item, just ""send it back"", telling me that they know there bulbs are defective...Just the fact that it lit up is the reason for the two stars.Low quality goods...Terrible Customer Service"
3,Lasted just past warranty and burnt out.,"I purchased this bulb knowing full well that I would be taking a chance that the bulb wouldn't last being that it is an after market bulb. This bulb did make a huge difference in brightness and breathed new life into my older TV, so that is a plus. My bulb burnt out just days after the warranty period was up. So, now to buy a new one."
1,Replacement lamp didn't even work for 2 months,"What a rip off. I received this product in Sept, It stopped working in Dec, the return policy expired in Nov. I'll change my rating if I get a replacement that lasts for a year."
2,Didn't work,I guess I'm probably the exception but when I got my replacement lamp it would not mount into the TV. I spent hours trying to get the thing to mount into my TV. Finally I had to take the bulb out of my new housing and mount it into the old housing. After doing that the old housing slid right in and mounted instantly. Also its not any brighter then my 4 year old bulb was that I replaced. I was completely disappointed.
2,Reversal on previous review,"Got the lamp a few weeks ago and was amazed at the ""new"" picture...it was bright and crisp. Also commented on how easy it was to install. The only problem is, the picture has already faded. So, I'm thinking this was the equivalent of getting your aluminum foil at the dollar store. Oh well live and learn."
5,SOMETHING MY TELEVISION NEED .,"WOW!THIS PRODUCT MADE THE PICTURE MORE BRIGHTER THEN BEFORE, NOW I CAN SEE THE TELEVISION PICTURE IN THE DAY TIME."
2,"short life, buyer beware","I bought a replacement bulb and housing from dynamic lighting (XL 2400) for my sony lcd tv. The original bulb lasted 5 years, this one lasted 13 months. Dynamic lighting would not warranty the bulb past 6 months. They would not even discount a new bulb one dime. I tried Amazon and Sony directly with no results. It was a sony bulb, so I thought the might at least pro-rate or discount a new one, not a chance. wouldn't even give me 10% off towards a new one which if you are buying from sony is a rip off. $200!!"
2,Not sure,I am not sure the product is working properly. Occasionally when I turn the TV on the red light comes on showing that there is a problem with the bulb. After I turn the TV on and off a couple of times it will begin working OK.
1,"Great service with logistics, but the bulb stopped working.","Purchased the bulb assembly from Lamps Direct LLC, and paid for overnight shipping. Recieved the bulb as promised next day in great condition. Vacumed out the bulb compartment, installed the new bulb assembly, and reset the timer. Wow, the TV came right on when powered up. Picture looked great! Next day turned the TV on to watch some news only to find the Bulb had stopped working or burnt out. Wanted a replacment but was only able to return for a refund. I wrote a reveiw just like this one and posted it. A week later i was contacted by the seller and promised a replacment bulb would be shipped to me at no cost, if i was willing to remove the negative feedback. That was 7/20/12. So i did just that and notified them by e mail that i had removed the feedback as promised. That was 7/21/12. A week later, and no response, and no new bulb as promised. :~( Review is on Lamps Direct LLC, not lamp monsters.Sony XL-2400 DLP Replacement Lamp"
3,These things seem to blow quicker and quicker...,I have had to replace this lamp 5 times in a three year span...I finally replaced it with this bulb and it worked well so I sold the TV. These were easy enough to replace but the cost made me not like the TV so much.
1,Replacment lamp damaged my optic block 300 bucks,I ordered a replacement lamp for my sony wega kdf 46E2000. back in june. just so I had a spare on hand. I usually order official sony parts but decided to try and save some money this time. This is the 3rd time I have replaced the lamp since owning my tv. since 06 or 07. Now after replacing this lamp I got a red bar at top and blue at bottom of tv screen. looking at this issue on various forums and after contacting sony. I am going to need a new optic block for 300. can't even return this lamp for my money back now because it's past the july return date.learned my lesson always purchase OEM parts from now on
1,Sony XL-2400 Replacement Lamp for Grand WEGA 3LCD Rear Projection,"I purchased this bulb at Lamp Monsters in June and used it in October as soon as the bulb was changed the TV was very dark, this bulb lasted 1 week."
3,SATISFIED,"For those of you who own the Sony Grand WEGA Rear Projection TV and require a new bulb. BEWARE: DO NOT order the ENTIRE casing/bulb--only order the bulb as the (new)casing around this bulb does NOT fit properly. I had to take the bulb out of the old casing and place the new bulb in it for it to fit properly. It's really a simple fix (just a few screws) but had I known this prior to ordering, I would've just ordered the bulb and saved myself some money. Once I did the switch-a-roo, it worked like a charm. Otherwise, I am happy that I have an operational TV again."
5,SWEET!,Perfect fit and function at a truly excellent price! Restored the brilliance I was unaware the screen had been missing.
1,Unhappy customer,I bought this bulb in July of this year only for it to burn out and actually shatter 5 months later. I'm still waiting to hear back from the company.
2,the quality is very poor,when i got the item which is a projection lamp with house for my sony tv i installe it properly in it place but when i switch on the tv its just start for a few minutes 2to 3mn and switch off by it self i have to keep doing this operation for every 5mn im going to send it back even i paid 17 $ for the express mail.
5,Easy to install,"All I had to do was pop open the side of my tv, pull out the old lamp, and place this one in. I didn't bother to read the instructions and it only took a second. It made my tv look brand new until it started to turn yellow later (if your tv does the same thing google the problem and find out how Sony will replace your old tv)"
3,Not quite the same...,"After struggling to get the tv to accept the new bulb, we saw that the wiring harness was slightly different between the old housing and the new housing. We found a video on Youtube to show us how to remove the bulb and ended up opening up the housing and swapping out the wiring harness. After that the TV accepted the new bulb and the picture is like the tv is new again! The difference in cost between this and buying from Sony made it worth the hassle."
2,Housing faulty,"Does not work out of the box for KDF-55E2000. Several attempts were made to just swap, but the unit caused the TV to flash a red light 3 times. I eventually had to swap the bulb with my old housing (waste of an extra $20...didn't want to fuss with a return)This item is definitely NOT an OEM replacement, and there's an off brand bulb in the housing also. Do not take your chances.The picture of the the product does not match what is delivered. After comparing, the silver tab on the top is only half the size of the one pictured above. I will upload a photo of the housing."
3,OK. Works great . . . with some tweaking,"Bought this lamp and housing to replace one in a Sony KDF50-A10 television. My picture had been dimming over the last few months. Removal of the old lamp was effortless, as was insertion of the new lamp and housing. However, it did not work. I repeatedly got a blinking red Power/Standby light when I inserted the new housing. After five tries, I removed the new lamp from the new housing and installed it in the old XL2400 housing (which appeared to be exactly the same with the exception of the length of the metal lens clamp on the front). Using the ""bare lamp"" instructions provided with this product, exchanging the housings took about 10 minutes. Once I did this, it worked great, with a noticeable improvement in picture brightness and clarity. In retrospect, I would have purchased the bare lamp and inserted it in the old housing."
2,Only lasted 6 months,"I'm very disappointed that this bulb only lasted for about 6 months at casual usage. It literally blew up in our tv after a low on life message. It did burn nice and bright right up until it blew, however. Six months is not enough usage to earn any more than 2 stars from me."
2,Works for 20 mins only,"I bought this product to replace the lamp on my 5 year old TV. The product packaging looked amateurish. The installation was quick. The TV came on bright and like-new. But, it was short lived as it stopped working after 20 mins. I let it cool off and turned the TV on an hour later.. it was working fine again.. but alas, only for another 20 minutes. I realized that this product is made out of cheap plastic and might be causing the issue. So, finally I took the bulb out of the cheap plastic and installed it inside the casing of my Sony original. This seem to work. I've had it for couple of days and no issues so far.Lesson learnt for me.. only buy original/quality product. Cheap knock-offs are...cheap and wont work all the time!"
1,"dont buy used, from: tech for less","I purchased a used ""in new condition"" from: tech for less, and was verry unhappy with the product when it arrived. It was used up, not almost new. My tv displayed a message stateing that the lamp was at the end of its life, and needed to be replaced. If you need on of these lamps buy new."
1,Should stick with OEM parts,"Replacement bulb fit is fine, however resulting picture is below par with discoloration at the top and bottom of the screen. This product is a fine example of ""you get what you pay for"". I would recommend people to stay with OEM for replacement bulb."
1,Don't buy any products from this company,"I would very strongly recommend not to buy any lamps from this company.After receiving the lamp I installed the lamp into my Sony LCD television as per the manufactures instructions, this bulb did the same thing as the burned out bulb that was in my TV.I ended up contacting Best Buy and since my extended warranty was still valid I had them come to my house and replace the lamp with a lamp that the tech brought with him.Everything worked fine after that.I returned the lamp but had to pay a 15% restocking fee to this company even though the lamp was faulty and did not work!"
3,XL-2400 Review,"Hard to review something you have to purchase, get it or no TV viewing. However the good news is that it was a breeze to install, LCD was brighter, colors came to life and I recommend this product.Price on the site that I got it from was 30+% lower then most sites which made the must purchase a bit more palitable. Service and communication was outstanding......."
4,Review of Sony XL-2400,Much better price than buying a new TV. Since this is my boy's TV they play their video games on I said take it and go change it (always good for them to fix things). They had it installed in less than 30 minutes. There is a line at the top of the screen and am hoping that goes away. If not will have to take it back off and see if it is an adjustment. Overall - great experience and very easy to install for the price.
2,Not great,"Bought this item back in may of 2011 and just got the warning on the T.V. That the bulb was in need for replacement. 6 months shelf life...not that great, very unhappy that it has only lasted this long and now needs to be replaced."
2,Housing is faulty,"Like a number of others who have posted reviews here, I found out the hard way that the housing on this product is defective and as such the TV will not work. I ended up taking the bulb from the housing and installing it in my old housing which then worked. This took time and made this a very expensive bulb. TV has been working with this bulb for a week now, so will keep fingers crossed there are no issues with the bulb."
1,Poor Quality,"I've got a Sony KDF-46E2000. When installing, the module wouldn't seat correctly and I was getting the 3 red flashed from the power LED telling me the lamp is not installed or inserted correctly.After many tries, I decided to swap just the bulb and reuse my old lamp housing. It's very easy to do and there's several videos on Youtube showing you how. Just do a search for XL-2400. Remember, don't touch the bulb with your fingers.The poor quality of the module makes me wonder how long the bulb will last."
2,"Lamp works great, housing not so much","I have replace this before with no problem so when it came time to replace again, I thought no big deal. I received the unit and inserted in and for whatever reason there wasn't a solid connection with too much play. I ended up removing the lamp of the new and old units and put the new lamp in the old housing, which I knew worked."
5,pleased,Worked great...first gave a smell but went away on the 3rd day..and its still going strong I was alittle apprehensive at first because the price was less then half I found everywhere else but I am beyond happy I ordered it :)
3,Replacement Lamp,We now have a pink line on the top of our screen that does not go away. Price was great but product is not the best quality.
1,Buyer Beware Defective,"I ordered this lamp as a back up and when I needed it it didn't work ,.To much time has passed to return it The old one still works and the new one doesn'tIt is defective Sony XL-2400 Replacement Lamp for Grand WEGA 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV"
1,My bulb burst in the first week of use,The lamp was installed correctly. It worked for a whole week (including a whole Sunday of NFL football) and then burst/broke. Not sure why this happened. I will not be ordering from this supplier again.
3,Only lasted 18 months before having to replace it,"After 18 months, I'm back on here having to order a new one. Definitely disappointed. Granted, it was extremely simple to install but it should last longer than it did."
2,It was ok!!,"It was ok! Except there is a BIG BLUE SPLOCH in the middle of the screen! Buyers be warned!!! BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!!!"
4,sony xl-2400,I like it it's easy to replace but doesn't last to long because my tv in on 24 hours a day a year is about how long it last
4,Excellent result after some work,"Received this lamp in excellent condition, well packaged, new condition. Plugged it in and got the infamous POWER/INDICATOR three flashing red lights. This happened dozens of times over the next two days. I was extremely frustrated. Finally, as a last result, I removed the new lamp from its housing, installed it into the original housing and the TV fired right up with amazing results. The TV looks brand new! I would advise people to just buy the lamp without the housing and install it yourself. Very, very happy to find this lamp rather than paying over $200 bucks to Sony for the same thing."
1,Doesn't work. Housing out of spec.,"bought this lamp to replace my 5 year old original lamp that became dim. new lamp works for 5-10 min and then tv shuts down and shows lamp error. reinserted new lamp 5 times but result is the same.ended up to install back my old lamp and return this new lamp.beware that this lamp is of poor quality and in my case it is out of spec.visual comparison of my old lamp and this new lamp shows that contact pads are half millimeter smaller in new lamp housing. Obviously it will cause quick overheating and current loss and hence ballast circuitry shuts down power... again, product is out of spec...returned product... but amazon didn't refund 5.85 for shipping... crap..."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FOR KDF50-E2000,"Order was easy and delivery was on time. I tried to install the lamp on my KDF50-E2000 and it caused my red power light to flash in rounds of 3, put the old lamp back in and it did the same thing as well even though it worked before just had a darker picture. I took it to a tv repair place and the guy told me the new lamp housing was slightly different than the old one and wouldn't work. He said I cracked a circuit board probably trying to get it to work. He took the bulb out of the lamp I ordered from Amazon and put it in the houseing of my old lamp to get it to work and had to replace the circuit board. Beware of this product!"
2,Worked great until.....,"It blew up, literally. As others have said it was easy to install and worked like a charm at first. I did, however, expect it to last more than 6 months. I heard a loud pop in the TV and pulled out the replacement bulb. It had shattered. Rather than continue to buy new bulbs every 6 months, I'm just going to buy a new TV. Buyer beware of what you might be getting."
2,Not that good,"I purchased this item and it arrived on time and as promised but it did not work.....period. I had to remove the bulb and install it into the old housing. I tried to leave the contacts in place that were on the new bulb but again it did not work. I had to put the bulb into the old housing and use every thing that was with the old housing to get it to work so I guess I purchased a new bulb. But then checking on the price of a new bulb alone, it was more that twice the cost so I guess I am ahead. It is not....repeat NOT....a factory item, it was assembled in Mexico and all the contacts will not work on the TV. Purchase this item if you want a bulb at half the price but be ready to change everything out and DO NOT THROW AWAY the old housing because that is the only thing that worked with the new bulb."
3,Four Days late.....,It was Four days late. It seems to be working fine. No problems installing it. TV bright again. Packaging could have been better.The airpack that was used was empty.
4,Sony LCD TV replacement lamp,"The item purchased is fine so far;however, the item description indicated the lamp was made by Sony and instead the item delivered was a generic lamp."
1,broke in 3 weeks,"I bought the product, which was listed as new, and it blew in three weeks. I dont recommend the company."
2,easy but not lasting long,Very easy to install and good price; however bulb starting to go after not quite a year and a half...
3,Projection TV replacement lamps,"This is my second purchase of this product. In my experience, the repalcemance lamps do not last nearly as long as the originals."
1,Didn't work,Opened installed and the tv would not turn on. looked up teck answer for the blinking code and it was bulb error. Reinstalled three times to try to get it to work and recieved the same error every time. Put the old bulb back in and tv worked fine. I am going to try the phillips brand because i am told they are the ones who make it for sony.
2,Okay for a little while...,"Received my replacement bulb in late June and installed just fine. Took all but one minute to replace. Replacement bulb was a good match and noticed a big difference in the brightness on my TV. I guess over time I did not notice it getting dimmer and dimmer...but now we are just past the 6 month warranty mark and ""POP"" it goes out. Very disappointed to see the bulb only last 6.5 months when the last one lasted 4 years, I have the KDF-55E2000...guess I will be looking for a different replacement from another company this time."
1,not good,Replacement unit would not work at all. Removed bulb and placed it in the origional unit to get it to work
4,Replacement Lamp,Here in Canada they wanted $300.00 an more for this lamp. I made this my first purchase with amazon.com as the price was less then $175.00 plus shipping. I was nervous lake most ordering from the internet. This purchase was over a year ago and still works fine in the TV and came from California. I'm pleased to this point and will do it again.
1,It lasted 3 days!,"I received this item around the 21st of June but didn't get around to install it until the 23rd or 24th... like others have noted... it takes longer to open the tv slot than it is to install it and it is super easy...I was super happy...everything was working GREAT! then I went on vacation from Jun 26 til July 4th... THE TV WAS OFF THE WHOLE TIME... when I got back I found my tv had a HUGE green line across the top of the screen... not only that now it went back to the ""the lamp is nearing the end of its life"" notice when I turn it on... this is supposed to be a TWO YEAR fix... not 2 days...not sure if it's this distributor or my particular one... but since I can't get a straight answer from them please be aware you're stuck w/ a bad item when you're unlucky enough to get it and they won't answer their phone/email... now they're selling it cheaper than I bought it... makes me wonder..."
2,XL-2400 lamp from MarginMart,"Bought XL-2400 lamp from MarginMartSony XL-2400 Replacement Lamp for Grand WEGA 3LCD Rear Projection HDTVand regret it. First MarginMart sent the wrong lamp which had to be returned and then delayed the replacement XL-2400 that it did not make it here by Superbowl and I had to cancel my party. The new lamp when it did arrive looked like a refurbished product and was not original Sony as the product description made it out to be. Mainly, I have a dark bar across the top of the screen with this bulb and am in the process of returning it for good. DO NOT BUY FROM MARGINMART. Apart from poor product, very poor customer service including long silences answering e-mails."
1,This lamp does not last,"After 3 years of using our Sony TV, we needed a new lamp. I bought this lamp in July, and by the following February it had already burnt out. The original lamp lasted 3 years for about $200, and this lamp lasted 7 months for about $100. Save your money and get the real lamp from Sony."
1,Not at All,"Packaged up real nice, Housing would not fit in my tv .I tried suggested adjustments to no avail.Bulb did not work. Sending it back. I am going to reorder as I need a working bulb."
5,Happiness is a new lamp!,"Thrilled with the quality of this lamp. Just got it this morning and the difference is night and day replacing the lamp. I had replaced the lamp previously about 1 1/2 -2 years ago and was considering getting a new TV since the picture was so dark. The TV never gave any change lamp warnings - where it had when we replaced it originally, so we just assumed something was wrong with the TV itself. SO GLAD I rolled the dice and decided to replace the lamp. Once I pulled the old replacement out and compared it to the one I received today - I think I got a cheap lamp last time. This new one looks like higher quality, and I don't remember seeing such a stark difference when I replaced it before. And the other one was more expensive. Go figure. I'm picking up more of these to have back up. You can't beat the price. So pleased!!!"
1,This product is defective!,"We purchased this replacement lamp in August 2012, and it died yesterday (1/4/13). The original lamp lasted 6-7 years, the replacement lasted less than 5 months. There is visible damage around the bulb - it actually looks like it has melted. It is advertised as a Sony product, but I see nothing on the product that indicates it was manufactured by Sony. This is a waste of $$$$$. Not happy!"
5,Like it!,Product came in very good condition. It did not give me any trouble to adapt to the TV and it works perfectly.
1,The Lamp is not performing well,I changed the lamp a couple of weeks ago and now the TV is calling for me to change it again. It is taking forever for the TV to come on and the lamp to warm up. Very disappointed in the performance.
5,Perfect Fit,Got the message on your screen to replace the bulb? This is exactly what you need. Replacement is as easy as 1 2 3.
4,leary of some of the reviews but so far am satisfied,This part directly from Sony was over $300 (YIKES) so when I saw this on amazon for less than $50 I was skeptical. The review (which were many) were half and half so I decided to take a chance. Some of the reviewers said the part wasn't original Sony (not sure if what I received is or not) and that it didn't fit correctly. Ours looked identical to the part we took out and the new part fit perfectly. So we are happy so far. Did notice a great improvement in the brightness/color with the new lamp. Guess only time will tell on how long it lasts (some reviews said it didn't even last a year). Our original lamp lasted well over 6 years. For the price we got the replacement for if it last 3-4 years we will be happy.
5,fits perfect,The housing fit perfectly opposite of other reviews i have read and its works perfectly. Make sure to take the bulb you are replacing out and compare the best as possible before ordering it really helps determine if it is the correct bulb.
4,okay,I husband bought this about a week ago. but for some reason my tv still says that I should replace the lamp. the picture looks fine but why would it say that it I just installed a new lamp.
4,Great Low-cost Alternative,"Item received quickly, was packaged well to prevent any shipping damage. The picture is great, and I hope that the service life will approach the brand name models. If it does, this will be a great low-cost alternative to the brand names which are advertised for 2-4 times as much than this one."
2,You get what you pay for.,You get what you pay for. The bulb only lasted 3 months. Spend the money and buy the quality parts.
2,"Did not work as a replacement in my TV, BUT.....","As many others have commented, this was not ""compatible"" with my TV. The TV would turn on for about a minute and then turn off again. I read someone else's review (THANK YOU!) advising switching the bulbs out of the housing compartments. The bulb itself is fine, it's the plastic housing that doesn't fit properly. So, look up on YouTube ""XL2400 bulb replacement"" and you will see a video of how to switch out the bulbs. It took me about 10 minutes and my TV is functioning perfectly (so far). I haven't checked how much it costs to get a bulb directly from Sony, but this seems like a decent option if you don't mind a few extra steps!"
1,Do Not Buy,"Do not buy this bulb. I had an extremely trying time with this. The bulb would not work in my TV. I had to use the old bulb housing, take it apart and put the new bulb in the old housing. The quality is suspect and I do not know how long I will get out of this unit. It's better to pay more for the genuine Sony replacement bulb then go with this cheaper junk."
2,"paid for the package, should have bought the parts","Similar to story to some of the other reviews, this housing wouldn't work in my TV. It seemed to fit okay, but ultimately wouldn't work. I wound up removing the bulb and throwing away the housing... just replaced the bulb in my original housing.Just buy the bulb."
1,did not last the 6 month warranty!,"our projection lamp, installed yesterday is already popping up on screen the lamp is nearing end of life. The date stamped on the lamp is 06/30/2012. I did't know if that was the exp date or the date when made available--I still don't know. we will have to get another projection lamp--before returning the one ordered via Amazon. The screen hasn't turned black yet. Will order another from a more reliable seller.Is this a genine ""sony"" made by sony lamp? Did not get any projection lamp nearing end of life message. Screen just suddenly wnt blank."
4,Projection lamp,Lamp works fine. However it was not the diagnosed problem that was determined. Sony products are sometimes over priced as well as over rated. Delivery was better than was stated.
5,Sony TV lamp,"It was easy to replace, if i would have went to best buy again it would hav been 210.00, it only cost me 35.00. and it was there right on time not much of a delay."
3,Shadows on screen,"This was delivered on time and is reasonably priced, but does not provide uniform illumination. There are some shadows on the screen from some structure inside the bulb that can be seen on a ""blank"" screen. They are not very visible to me when normal TV shows are on, and I wouldn't have noticed it during normal programming if I hadn't seen it on the blank screen first."
1,Beware,"Ordered a XL 2400 replacement lamp to have as a back up for my Sony TV. Well, when I needed it (after the 90 day warranty period), the lamp did not work properly. The company basically said too bad. They were not at all concerned about the poor quality of the product they sold me. I guess you get what you pay for!"
3,"Cheap, works better than my old bulb","It is cheap, got it for like $32. the screen is much brighter now, but every few minute the screen flickers really quick , kinda like a strobe light. it'll do it for like 10 seconds then go back to normal for awhile, then do it again. hoping this will go away eventually, but we will see."
2,Lasted 1 year and 6 months almost to the day.,"It seemed to work fine up to this point. I took it out and heard some rattling as I moved it, and sure enough the filament had exploded inside. With others saying the original bulb lasts 5 years and up, this isn't good at all. I doubt I'll find the original, so I'm stuck with getting another one of these. At least the price is in the 30's instead of the $94 I paid for it originally."
2,Not as good as the original.,This replacement lamp works but there are some problems. My screen is not nearly as bright as it was before and there appear to be yellow colored vertical stripes in the background of all channels. I wonder if the bulb is defective or if it is not as good as the original SONY product?
4,Review of Sony XL-2400 replacement Lamp for Grand WEGA,"At first I didn't know which replacement lamp to buy for my Sony WEGA 3LCD television because there were several listed on AMAZON and the prices varied greatly. I did not want to spend a lot of money because the TV was old and I felt if the replacement part was going to be over $125 that it would be cheaper and better to just buy a new TV. I chose this lamp because it wasn't the cheapest and it wasn't the most expensive. It arrived the next day because I paid extra for next day shipping. When we first installed it the picture was extremely grainy and I was greatly disappointed. All I could think is you get what you pay for! I even considered returning the part but decided to wait and see if the longer the TV ran the better the picture became. Well that is exactly what happened. Within a few days the picture was awesome, and no longer grainy. I am very happy with my purchase and it did not cause the national debt!"
3,Doubt this is a Sony product,"I bought this because the item description said it was ""by Sony."" However, it seems to be made by some no-name company. There is no name anywhere, and the directions look like they were made by a third grader. Don't get me wrong...it works, and was easy to install, but I think if an item says it's made by a certain company, it should in fact be made by that company. I'm guessing it will burn out faster than a name brand one. I wish Amazon would do something to these sellers that falsely describe their products."
1,Warning Get only Sony Parts for your WEGA TV,"Just purchased the XL-2400 bulb, tried for over an hour to get it to work with my Sony WEGA 50"" TV no luck, Call Sony & a Authorized Sony TV Repair Center. Was told by repair center that many after market bulbs will not work with Sony TV -need to get original bulb from Sony only $100+ to get TV to Work. Hopefully Amazon's will take care of this matter so I can return bulb and get one that works. Back to using old bulb till then( shows yellow blotch viewing screen)."
5,Great replacement for my Sony Grand WEGA,very easy to install - made my TV look new again! vendor was excellent to work with; thanks!
1,This was total junk,This Sony replacement lamp was Junk! The original lamp lastedover 5 years & was still working. This replacement lamp lasted just a little more than 3 weeks.It went out last night. We will be returning it.In the meantime we installed the original. It still works.
1,Not a Sony Brand Bulb,"Sony is the first word in the description of this bulb, but I don not believe Sony made this bulb. But we kept it. Now a few months after we bought it and the bulb flickers a little bit, which never happened with this TV when we replaced the bulb before (with a REAL Sony bulb). I will not buy this bulb from this source again."
1,Technician says it was defective,"We purchased this back in November and within a few weeks the TV started cutting off again. I figured it had to be something else wrong with the TV since we just replaced the light unit. We finally had a Service Representative check our TV and it was confirmed the unit was defective. To be fair to the Vendor, we haven't issued a direct complaint and requested a replacement. I will update this review once we evaluate their customer service to this problem."
1,not get it,I'm sure that if actually got the product I ordered which I never did and the company charged me for it I would really like it. Since I never got the product I have to say it sucks worse than sweet lemons. Thanks for asking my opinion
4,AS ADVERTISED,"PRODUCT WAS DELIEVERD ON TIME AND WORKED AS PROMISED.CONSIDERING THE LOW PRICE COMPARED TO OTHERS SIMILAR ,WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.WOULD CERTAINLY BUY AGAIN"
1,Didn't work,"We bought this to rejuvinate our tv as the picture has been very dark for awhile but the bulb still worked. New bulb was installed and it didn't work. We thought maybe we didn't put it in right so we re-installed the old one. It worked fine. We tried the new one again and again. After each failure, we tried the old one, which worked every time. I don't know what the problem is but, its going to be returned tomorrow. Since it was not damaged in shipping, Amazon will not replace only refund. So, now, we order from a different supplier and cross our fingers. The come from Lamp Monsters or as we now call them, Lamp Morons."
1,Not a OEM bulb,"I was led to believe that the is/was a SONY OEM productit is not, it works, but greatly effects the warm up time for my set (over a minute)putting in the old dull OEM bulb results in about a 8 second wait time"
1,Can't get it to work,I've tried putting it in over 30 times. Most of the times I get the blinking light and the TV cuts off. A few times the TV works for a minute and then cuts off. I had read many reviews that said this happened to them as well and that I should just keep trying. I keep trying. It just won't work.
3,Not a perfect replacement,"This bulb was not recognized by by TV. I ended up replacing the rear housing with the original and it worked.Other than the initial problems, the bulb works perfectly and provided a brilliant picture."
1,Don't bother,"Bought this to replace the lamp in my Sony Rear Projection TV. This was the second bulb I had put in. The first was a OEM that cost $150 locally. Knew that I could get one for less online for less. Yes, you can get one cheaper online, but buyer beware. For $60 I should have known it was to good to be true. When installed, the housing never lined up and never get in a true seated position. The TV would not even turn on. Sent this one back and order just a bare bulb. Five minutes and a screwdriver had the new bulb installed in the old factory housing. I should have just taken the bulb out of this one but I did get free return shipping and a quick refund. The next time you need a new lamp replacement, just buy a bare bulb and do it yourself."
1,don't waste your money,"I received this today. This lamp is not the same as the original, is of inferior quality, does not easily lock into place and the metal arm doesn't appear to have any spring like the original Sony lamp. When I inserted the new lamp it would not snap into place and the plastic ""hook"" literally broke into pieces. I am returning it and buying the real deal from Sony."
1,poor purchase,"Brought this hoping to replace my old OEM lamp. Bad idea, this 'new lamp' throws horrible blue/red and yellow streaks all over the screen that we're not there before.(((((BUYER BEWARE)))))))))))"
1,Knock off lamp lasted less than 4 months!,"I bought one of these lamps in May--and it died this weekend (just a week past the warranty period). After doing some research, it seems this is a common problem with these knock-off bulbs, with many people reporting they last less than a year. If I had reviewed this a couple months ago, I would have gave it 5 stars--it was easy to install and worked fine. Unfortunately, it only lasted a few months (my original lasted for YEARS). Spend the extra $20-30 and get one that is very clearly labeled as a true new Philips bulb. I wish I had!"
1,dont buy from this company!!!,"I bought a Sony lamp that was suppose to last 3 years and it didn't even last a year. I attempted to get a refund or have them replace the lamp but they said it was past the 6 month warantee. They did not stand by their product and now after a year, I will have to spend another $100-200 to replace it."
2,averaged $25 a month too much,The bulb was easy as pie to install but I'm not happy with the fact it only lasted 4 months.
4,good product at a good price!,The product supplied was a good product at a good price. I found the product on other websites but for about 50-70 dollars more. The only thing that I can say about this product is make sure that you read the replacement process completely before you install and use your TV!
5,Works perfectly,I got this for my Sony TV and it restored it to working just like new. I do not know how long it will last but the factory one lasted about 4 years. Hopefully this one will last as long.
5,Awesome Service!,Old Lamp fried on a Sunday...had new one by Thursday. Product very easy to install! Very Highly recommended if you happen to need this particular lamp for your TV.Cheers!
1,Sony TV bulb,I ordered two replacement bulbs and neither one of them worked and one of them fell apart when I opened the package and would like a refund.
3,"Good lamp, housing looked fine but didn't work.","This lamp and housing is exactly as described and I'm glad that this seller goes to lengths to educate its customers on genuine phillips lamps. The lamp is great... but I could not get the lamp in the aftermarket housing to work in my TV, not matter how many times I tried to reseat it and ensuring the lamp door was closed. Similar to other reviewers, the only way I could get this to work was to reinstall the replacement lamp (a good lamp at that) into the original housing that was in my TV. The next time I'll just purchase the lamp."
1,Robbery Fake Bulb,"I purchased this bulb thinking that I was getting a Sony bulb for my TV and was disappointed when I tried to turn on my TV and nothing changed. I got an error message stating that the newly purchased bulb had the same problem as the original Sony ""Philips"" bulb. I am really shocked that this was not the original Sony bulb as advertised. Now I have lost my money and my TV still does not work, that is why I am writing to warn other consumers to be careful of companies like this one who are trying to rob them with false advertisements."
5,Works Great,"I've had the lamp for 4 years now. It's worked great, easy to install. Lasted through two movings from one home to another."
3,expected it to last longer,"Purchased this replacement bulb May 2011 for like 100 bux.....just blew up today and when i mean blow up i mean shattered, but self contained for the most part...i expected it to last much longer...the original bulb lasted at least 7 years and when its life was close to done the tv gave me a nice notification that the bulb needed to be changed soon...having it just explode is not cool...at least now i see the price is significantly lower"
5,tv lamp,"Replacement lamp works very good. It restored my tv picture 100%. My tv is now just as good as it was when it was new. Before I replaced the lamp we could not watch tv in the day time, as our tv is located in our sun room."
1,Should have listened to the other bad reviews!,As soon as I put the bulb housing into my TV it looked horrible. Big blue bar on the bottom of the screen and a small goldish bar on the top of the screen. This is being returned tomorrow! Guess I have to buy it directly from SONY :/
1,Never Again,"I have purchased replacement bulbs in the past online with no issues however, this time was different. It was not as described--built completely different that it was listed as. It looked cheaply made, not very heavy--just not at all what I have purchased in the past. For the money, I expected a Sony replacement bulb...but this wasn't it. It also didnt work after we received it. I will purchase directly from Sony now."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,Lamp came on time & in the housing as described however there are now wide lines of discoloration across the top & bottom of my tv screen that were not there prior to replacing the lamp. Red across the top & green across the bottom. VERY annoying & distracting! DO NOT BUY!!!
3,NOT O.E.M.,THE AD MAKE'S IT SOUND LIKE IT IS AN ORIGINAL SONY LAMP WHICH IT IS NOT.IT SEEMS TO BE AN AFTER MARKET BULB OR REMANUFACTURED ONE.
1,Lamp become defective less than 45 days,After ordering the lamp within 45 days had a message on the TV screen to say that the lamp is near its end of life and need to be replaced....so since the warranty is 6 months I requested a replacement and Iam be very unhappy with this product
5,great product,"quick, easy, inexpensive fix if you have an lcd projection! when my bulb went out, i was a little worried, but this new lamp fixed the problem, and the picture looks great! i would recommend this lamp to anyone out there still hanging on to an lcd projection."
2,Pink Line,After I installed the lamp there was a pink line across the top of the TV. I put the old one back in and it worked ok.Shipping was on time.
2,Housing,Had to put build in Sony housing then it worked fine. A major pain in the tail. Was easy to change components but the description said it would work. Still a lot cheaper going this way but a major pain!!!
5,Very Good projection lamp for Sony Grand Wega,"My husband don't have a hard time installing and removing it from our TV, it fits perfectly and you can tell it's brand new because our TV screen looks like new."
3,Just OK,The service was great and it was easy to install. I dont think it is as bright as the OEM bulb. It is still dark on many scenes
1,Returned immediately,"The item was listed as new when purchased. When received, item had scratches and was anything but new. Appeared as though item had been assembled using spare parts. Completely misrepresented In listing. Item was returned immediately and refund given by Amazon."
4,Took 2 Lamps!,"First off just let me say that the vendor was excellent! The first lamp blew out in just 4 days, but I let them know and they sent off a replacement immediately, no questions asked. The 2nd lamp has now been working for a couple of weeks, and if it continues, then this was a great buy. If not???? I'll be back to let you know."
3,Sony replacement lamp,First lamp lasted one week and basically exploded. No parts came flying out. Second one has been running fine for a month with no problems.
1,Bad lamp,"I bought this replacement lamp and it was sold as new. When installed my TV would cycle on and off. Sony tech support suggested it might be a cooling fan on the TV. I took it to the local repair shop and they pointed out that the lamp I purchased looked remanufactured and had a 'weird looking' connector on the back. They showed it was pulling more amps than it should. Replace with a Sony lamp and TV works fine. Big hassle, cost me more money, Amazon supplier took more than a week tdo respond to my email messages, and Amazon would not back with their A-Z Guarantee because I contacted them past their time limit. Took me more than that to determine the lamp was the problem and note lag of response from supplier above. A-Z Guarantee? More like A-F'd up!"
1,Lamp went bad within 60 days after installation,Lamp went bad within 60 days after installation. Went to MarginMart website to contact us and nothing happened. Contacted Amazon and out of warranty (45 days).
1,Sony Lamp,The lamp was not nearly as good as the one Sony provided. This one began to fail within a week and I replaced it with one from Sony. Sometimes it just pays to buy from the manufacturer.
1,bad purchase,lamp only lasted from August to May - cheap is not the best deal.We contacted shipped and no response! Imagine that...
5,Exactly what I ordered.,"Worked perfectly, exactly what I needed. Great price, easy install. Looks like a new TV again! It was quite a bit cheaper then buying it off of Sony's website or other similar websites."
5,Sony XL-2400 Replacement Lamp,"Ordered this lamp in June when the old one started giving me issues during a construction project, When it arrived I decided to wait until after the project was done before I installed it. Well project is complete and the new lamp installed and it works great. I have just ordered another lamp as a backup from the same company. Ordering the lamp was a lot cheaper than buying a new TV actually several hundreds cheaper."
5,Great purchase!,Easy installation and the picture is perfect. Have had the new lamp in for a month now and the TV is as good as new.
1,Do not waste your time ordering this lamp!,"The site would not allow me to give this product ""zero stars"", my true rating for this lamp. The lamp did not work! After waiting for it to arrive, reading and re-reading the section of the manuel that describes how to replace the lamp, the lamp did not work. The housing did not fit properly. We also suspect that the bulb is defective. We have decided to just spend the extra money and buy a name brand bulb from a company that we have done business with in the past. Then we will put the new bulb into the original housing. I suggest that Amazon.com require the companies that sell replacement lamps for TV's to test their products before they mail them to customers. Do not waste your time and money on these no-brand replacement lamps."
1,Sony xl-2400 lamp,"Bulb was ok , housing was defective. Had to pay a Sony tech to troubleshoot and discoverdefective housing. $125. Recommend buy direct from Sony."
3,Product works fine,"The product works fine. There is a noticeable slower response/refresh rate when you change channels. Don't know why but it's there. However, it works and reasonably priced."
1,Only lasted 5 months,"I purchased this bulb at the end of August 2012. On February 4th 2013 Superbowl Sunday, it went out. TV is not used excessively. There are only two people in the household. I will not be purchasing this bulb again without a warranty."
1,It only lasted 8 months,I purchased this replacement lamp for $60 in April 2012. It is now broken after 8 months. I mean yes I got it for a good price and all but it was too short lived. I would never buy from this company again. When I got the T.V. new it took 7 years for the lamp to go out. I really didn't expect another 7 out of this one for the price but I did expect it to last at least 3 to 4 years without breaking. I am really disappointed with my purchase with this company and would not buy anything else from them ever.
1,Disappointed,"The bulb was burned out when it arrived. I was not very happy, but because I waited so long to install it, I was unable to return it."
2,UNHAPPY,The TV is not working again because the replacement lamp is not working. I would think that the lamp would have lasted much longer than the purchase time.
3,projection replacement bulb,"the bulb works just fine. however, what i learned after replacing it is that with the wega grand sony tv's once you replace it you will have a red line 2 inches thick on the top of the tv screen and a blue one on the bottom of the screen, that if you look this up, other customers have had complaints about that i hear sony will not claim. the line isnt too bad, but it is frustrating that now you have another issue. after replacing the first problem. love that amazon had it at a great price. other websites are selling them for over 150$,"
1,"The part was refurbished, not new as advertised.","It was advertized as new, but the part was refurbished. I ened up having to replace it again right away."
5,So far so good,Works fine... I would say no discernible difference from the original lamp.... will know more over the life-cycle... good value for the price though.
4,So far So good.,"I passed on my old 50"" DLP HDTV to my mother, the factory bulb that we had blew on her tv. It seems that it was seemingly her fault she decided to block the vents. I got another replacement on amazon that included a casing which i had to completely dismantle and swap because it didn't work in the TV. But this time around the bulb worked great, the tv is nice and crisp and the bulb is working like a champ, the casing fit perfectly and didn't have to be mickey moused to fit."
5,Perfect Fit,I purchased thiis Bulb for a coworker with his help and knowledge of what he had to purchase before. This came in and work perfect. The price is awsome here on Amazon compared to retail.
3,Sony Bulb?,"I have doubts that this is an original equipment replacement. There is a blue area in the center of my screen when the TV is showing a dark or black background.Also, I ordered the Bulb on a Sunday, with 3 day delivery... the bulb arrived Friday; that's a long 3 days!"
5,saved a bundle,The price we paid for this lamp was a fraction of what Sony was charging. We got it within a week. TV's back up and running and we couldn't be happier.
5,Easy to Replace & Restore TV Quality,This was a great way to save having to replace the TV. Installation was simple and quick. Fully satisfied.
2,product fine service lousy,I bought the lamp it was easy to use it did not solve my problem and was a big waste of money. I should have just taken it to a service shop to find out what all was wrong with it instead of wasting my money. Service was lousy. I ordered the product it was suppose to be here 8 days later. It was not even shipped for 3 weeks. I do not plan to use Amazon again.
1,Broke within two weeks and no refund or exchange,"After recieving and installing the product, within two weeks it didn't work anymore. I called the seller and they said they cannot do anything and told me to call sony about the warrentee. Are you kidding me, it took almost two weeks to recieve the item from the date of purchse and within two weeks of use it went dead and they said they were not going to cover it because it was no longer cover within their warrentee. Do not buy from this seller. Buyers beware."
3,kindly waiting.......,"I have now changed my review on this item because I was asked to do so before another one would be sent. I orginally ordered this item on Dec 31, 2008. It is currently Feb. 9th, 2009, and am waiting for either a new lamp or a reimburstment.... once I receive either I will remove the comments :)"
1,Bad,I had to have a tech come out to find out that this lamp was bad and then paid over 300 dollars to repair and replace
3,Sony XL 2400 Replacement Bulb,"Received this item on time which was great however, upon installation the part did not work fully. Seemed to be faulty housing unit that the bulb was placed in, for when took new bulb out of 'new' housing and put it into previous housing unit, then worked when re-installed."
1,doesn't work,"packaged up for return within 15 minutes of opening it. I thought installation was so easy maybe I was missing something, but I wasn't. I put the old bulb back in and the tv worked fine. There's a few minor differences on the construction of this unit that might have changed the way it fits."
1,Does not fit television,"The last time I had to replace the bulb on my Sony projection TV it was almost $200.00. So I was excited to find a replacement this time for under $60.00. However, it would not fit properly and all I got was a blinking red led, indicating an error, when I tried to turn on the television. Thinking I was doing something wrong I put the old bulb back in and it powered up just fine. I noticed that the ring on the back of the bulb that works the hooks on the side of the bulb, would not retract all the way down, like the old bulb, to secure the bulb in place. I will be returning this and buying a new TV. No point in paying $200.00 for a (working) bulb when there are so many good deals on new TVs this time of year."
3,NOT a Sony product,"You should know that this product is NOT a genuine Sony product, though the description leads one to believe so. It's a no-name replacement part. It weighs a bit less than the genuine Sony lamp that I removed from the TV and is not constructed as well as the genuine. I had a little trouble getting it to fit properly - I had to try three times, and finally I was able to wiggle it around and lock it into place. Once installed, it seems to work just fine."
1,Don't think these are Sony!,"Titled SONY bulbs... I don't think so... These were inexpensive and it shows; they are also cheap. I bought two lamps and neither worked when I replaced the lamps (an easy job - I've replaced the lamp on this tv before). Took the tv to a shop where I paid $75.00 to get the bulb to work. The repair man explained it was not an OEM part. I ordered these two bulbs in October of 2011, and now 4 months later, the ""replace bulb"" warning is showing. I'm contacting Amazon to see what they'll do... I'd update later, but can I give less than one star?"
1,Failed in 30 seconds,"This was about my 3rd lamp replacement for this TV. I waited a couple months after ordering to replace it, trying to get as much life as possible out of the bulb. When I did replace it, it came on for about 30 seconds then failed. Now Amazon won't take it back. I shelled out the extra money for genuine Phillips for nothing.UPDATE 5/8/12I returned this bulb months ago. I keep sending messages to Amazon Customer Service and they do not reply. I have heard nothing from the seller. I have been an Amazon customer since forever and they have always done right by me. But in this case they have screwed me out of $100, and I am considering parting ways with Amazon over it.I ponied up another $200 to buy a genuine Sony replacement bulb from Best Buy and it works fine."
1,Not impressed,"I got this projector, which I wouldn't have bought from this company, except for the reviews I read were good. I was leaning toward another seller, and wish I would have done it.I received the project in a very timely manner. I installed it, which is very easy to slide it into place. I plugged in the tv and it did not work. It did what all the other complainants said...the tv would simply turn off. I tried several times to turn the tv on, just to have it turn off.I will not buy another projector, I think I will suck it up and just get a new tv."
3,New housing did not work,"The lamp was shipped with the housing, but would not work out of the box. I could get 1 to 5 minutes of picture before the lamp was turned off and the red light started flashing 3 times. After fiddling with the housing it worked for another 1 to 3 minutes. After way too much effort, I wound up moving the new bulb to the original housing. YouTube has a video for the XL-2400. It has worked for over an hour. There were no visual differences between the new and original housings but the screws were different."
1,stinky!!!,"I understand the need to put an irritant in the scent to make you notice the smell, but this product has gone too far!!If you have any kind of allergies at all, don't get this!! It gave me a stuffed up nose and a sinus headache. My boyfriend, who was sitting across the room from me, instantly got a stuffed up nose an red eyes when I came in to watch TV. If you use this product and your little kids act out-of-sorts a lot, it could very well be a headache from this product!!"
2,Not alot of boy patterns,"This should be really called Crochet for Girls, although the patterns for the girls are really cute I thought there would be more boy patterns, there are only few in this book."
2,Sent this one back,This book includes sweaters that *look* like you made them. Almost every pattern has sleeves that are very visably attached to the blocky body of a sweater. The designs are outdated and the finished products don't even look that great in the book.
4,Very good book,"I read the reviews for this book and checked it out at my local library. Personally, I found there to be some great patterns in it, and I am now putting it on my wish list for future purchase. It is true that there aren't many boy patterns in it, but that is hard to find anywhere. The patterns in this book are very cute and I can't wait to try them out!"
3,Very dark pictures,I love the projects in this book but as I purchased it in Kindle format all the pictures are in black and white which makes it very hard to see the finished results. Would like to have seen the pictures lightened so they are clearer.
5,FROM THE BEGINNING,"Thank you Motown for Early Classics. On each of these we get rare classics that seemingly cannot be found anywhere else. In this case it's Fingertips 1&2 and With A Child's Heart. Stevie mesmerizes us. Again, thank you Motown."
5,A visual journey to the great Four Corners.,"The Four Corners, Timeless Lands of the Southwest is another visually perfect offering by Northland Publishing in their travel series. Having lived in Northern Arizona and made several pilgrimages to the Four Corners area, I have always felt that no book could ever capture the intensity and energy that comes from this amazing real estate. I am delighted to share that this book does just that. The photography is breathtaking and it will haunt you into visiting there. Author, Kathleen Bryant, gives the reader a diverse sampling of the four corners areas as well as the culture, arts and flavor of all that call this special landscape home; truly as the subtitle states, ""A Visual Tour of Hopi and Navajo Homelands."" This softbound, coffee table size book is most affordable at under $10.00 and you will want to keep it within easy reach when you want to escape to this wonderous place."
3,Misleading and Disappointing!,"The Four Corners - where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah come together - is itself a desolate place simply consisting of a large marker surrounded by a number of native American vendors. The predominant nearby attraction is Monument Valley, about 60 miles away. Bryant, however, provides just a few photos of that area, and instead goes hundreds of miles further, including eg. photos from the Flagstaff, AZ. area and the Grand Canyon - omitting much closer Antelope Canyon and Horseshoe Bend (Page, AZ.), Natural Bridges National Monument (Utah), etc. Also, there was too much printed material, and not enough photos, and NO photo of the Four Corners Monument."
4,Pete Seeger sums up the disposession we all feel.,"Pete Seeger, the golden throated voice of the peace movement speaks for all of us through this recording. His unrivaled banjo and 12-string guitar ring resound through this recording. Thank God for Pete Seeger!"
3,Not Bad,I'm reading this book now and it's not bad at all. Considering that it was written in 1863 perhaps I should say-pretty good. Interesting little bits here and there with some inaccuracies but you can see where they came from and you can get a flavor of the thinking at that time. If we could give half-stars I would have said 3 1/2.
1,Nope,I dislike it. Nothing particularly special about this magnetic toy. The LED light is useless and dark. Even using the product in the dark you do not get much light to brighten up the toy.
2,Boring,"This toy is pretty cool. Good to bring to a science class to demonstrate magnetic fields and stuff. It levitates and you can spin it, but otherwise it's boring. Not fun to play with for long."
1,bad cd,"The individual who I purchased this CD for, seem to have liked it. They have not complained or made any comment. This is a recent update. When the CD was opened it would not play, which meant it could not be played in the US. I would like a re-placement or tell me how to return this one."
2,YUCK,"I normally like the smell of Patchouli... but this smell I hated. YUCK... don't buy this perfume essence, you'll hate the smell of Patchouli after that."
5,Witch or Not???,"This is a classic expose dating back to 1584. Thanks to the author many named witches were spared from being burned at the stake! The author reveals the secrets of so-called witches and explains their supernatural powers as being nothing more than conjuring tricks. If you like magic, or reading about the history of magic then this book is a must have. -Diamond Jim Tyler"
5,julie kenner does it again - another 5 stars,Julie Kenner is a great writer - I have enjoyed all of her books so far. This is no exception.... I loved the characters. I am hoping that maybe she writes a book about the chef Tim so that we can see how Lisa and Ken are doing...
5,Many years later still the best,"Great grill, heavy construction and has lasted for many years.Even when I tried to blow it up and burned a fatty duck, the unit survived explosion.Highly recommend!"
1,Flimsy,It is flimsy and hard to strike the keys. What is the purpose of the ribbon?? It is a pain! The shape is too boxy and hard to handle when you are trying to juggle your book and the dictionary. The design falls far short.
4,Good product,"Works well. Keys are very small, which I suspose is necessary, given the size, which is good for sticking in the book bag. Should be good for students, nine through university for quick reference. The only real pain, I suppose, is it's not very intuitive, which is the problems of all dictionaries, print or ""e"". If you don't know how to spell the word, a print dictionary might be easier."
3,Well made but not that great,"This is useful, but I would recommend a regular electronic dictionary that has more features and easier keys to use. This dictionary isn't very handy."
1,Good Information Masked by Bad Editting,"This book has a lot of valuable information with regard to the construction of a compiler, that fact is overshadowed by the amazingly poor editting.This is supposedly the ""first edition reprint with corrections"", but it seems like the vast majority of errors are yet to be corrected."
1,modern compiler implementation in ML,"I cannot describe my hate for this book in such a small space. Appel's writing is embarassingly bad. Some of the ML code he gives as examples doesn't even compile in sml. It may have been better if he actually described what all his complicated structures were meant to do. If this is your textbook for a compilers class, make sure that your professor knows more about compilers than Appel. BTW, if you're using ML to write a compiler, go learn a real language."
5,Brassy: Don't Miss this Disc,"I saw Brassy last week at south-by-southwest in Austin, bought the CD, and can't stop listening to it. It is infectious and original and grows and grows and grows on you until you can't put it away!"
1,Are you kidding?,"Brassy is without the a doubt the absolute worst group i've had the misfortune to see ""perform"" on a professional stage. Absolutely talentless, the band attempts to get by on an odd, lame neo-hip hop, and of course, Muffin Spencer's name, and succeeds only in being a silly sideshow.I suppose if you enjoy hearing a shrill vocalist screaming the band's name incessantly on top of a 3rd rate Elastica ripoff, then maybe Brassy is for you. Anyone else hoping to hear anything the least bit original or interesting (or at least not annoying) in this genre should stick to Cibo Matto or Lucious Jackson. Brassy is an absolute mess."
2,Engagingly written but has nothing to do with the Baal Shem,Wonderfully-told with great details of everday life inthe shtetl. But ultimately a rip-off if you expect it to be what it claims to be. The story is completely dismissive not just of the early Hasidim but of religion and indeed of spirituality. Left me really annoyed.
4,GREAT BLUES CD,"Another,mostly unknown blues guitar player that deserves more recognition. Think a mix of ALBERT COLLINS and ROY BUCHANAN and you would be close to this mans sound. He plays with real feeling and stays away from too many cliche licks, in favour of an improvisational style that may contain mistakes, but is ever soooooh soulfull. His singing is first class and his material is of a very high standard. When he rocks it is infectious and will set your feet on fire. Highly recommended!!"
5,"Smokin' Blues, great tribute.....","James Solberg was a long-time member of Luther Allison's band, playing with Luther right up until Luther's untimely death in the late 90's. In fact, some of James Solberg's best guitar work is on Luther Allison's outstanding ""Live in Chicago"". L.A. Blues is a blues tribute to his former band leader, and a very moving one at that. But it stands on it's own as a fine blues album of mostly original material (8 of 10 cuts), with my favorite the title track. I remember seeing this band perform several songs live and thinking what a shame that more people weren't there to hear this fine set of blues. Excellent work on the Hammond B3 by Larry ""3rd Degree"" Burne, by the way. Very nice renditions of ""Just a Closer Walk With Thee"" and Dylan's ""Ballad Of A Thin Man"" round out this fine album. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up, you won't be disapointed."
4,Another fun read,"HG Wells never fails to entertain and provoke thought, anyone from a child to adult will benefit from and enjoy his work"
2,Intermatic ML200RT Low Voltage Lighting Transformer,"Intermatic ML200RT 200 Watt Low Voltage Lighting Transformer, BlackThis was an exact replacement for the old system, the main problem is customer support, as there is none. I went to the Intermatic web site, sent emails, looked them up on web, called 800 number and left messages, no return calls. I needed to get replacement bulbs for this system, managed to figure it out with the help of a local hardware store. The problem ended up that I needed to buy new wire too, wish they would have told me that as I would have purchased it from them, instead I got it locally. My mistake was buying an old 200watt system, when for a few more dollars I could have gotten a 300 watt system and had more power. Due to lack of customer support I will never purchase an Intermatic product again, and Amazon lost my business for all future outdoor light projects."
1,? damaged product,"All other reviews were positive for this item but the top was broken off when it arrived. I taped it back on, thinking I would just keep it instead of returning, but timer does not work. I reset it and so did my son every day after he installed it. It would come on at the correct time but because the timer was off, it went off way before I had it set to go off. I wonder if this is a damaged item. I'm not asking for a replacement because I didn't realize this one didn't have the ""dusk to dawn"" setting and I want that."
4,Good old standby,"I purchased this as an identical replacement for one that had been damaged by the wires shorting out. I looked at the new ""electronic"" stuff and decided to stick with the old tried and true. Also, if you want two cycles per day the newer units won't handle it. I have this unit and two larger Intermatic units and all have worked well. I suppose one small criticism could be that the unit did not protect itself against the wires becoming shorted. However, failing is preferable to starting a fire!"
1,ML200RT,"Do not purchase this item unless you are willing to replace it every 5 years. I had purchased this from Lowe's about 5 years ago. Back then the warranty was 5 years. Of course the 12vdc output crapped out after 5.5 years. I just got off the phone with Intermatic customer service (manufactures them for Malibu) and they will not provide a replacement as it is past the 5year date. They followed up with ""be happy your warranty was 5 years as now the warranty is only 3 years."" Buyers you have been warned.To Malibu / Intermatic, I would be happy to take down this poor review on your crappy product if you would stand behind your product and replace my failed unit. You know how to contact me as my warranty claim # was 153827."
5,As Advertised,"Good product.Performed as advertised and solved our yard lighting issue. Item ordered and arrived quickly. Good service, quality product.Thank you."
3,"Good transformer, bad timer!","The transformer operated my Malibu lights okay, but the timer portion didn't function at all, ever! I had to turn the lights on and off manually! Fortunately, Amazon took it right back so I bought another identical one that works great!"
5,Fantastic,"This controller, the wires and lights I bought all worked perfectly. An awesome finish to a deck project and now the lighting is drawing great compliments. This controller still has sufficient capacity for me to add a string of walkway lights. I would recommend going 200-300% over your initial power calculations on this as additional capacity is cheap."
4,Transformer and timer OK,"Old 120 watt transformer/timer did not have the capacity for new Halogen bulbs. Had to upgrade to this 200 watt transformer/timer.Transformer/timer was shipped in box without adequate packing material. As a result, the hinge pin on one side of the cover broke. Cover now lays on top of the transformer/timer. Cover can easily be knocked off to expose timer dial to rain.Not worth the effort or expense to return item. I'll see how long the cover stays in place. May use duct tape to hold it in place."
1,"Do not buy, doesn't keep time accurately","I got this to connect some LED hardscape lights and at it works good for that but it does not keep correct time, sometimes the lights come on at night sometimes the come on during the day. The timer is off sometimes by 12 hours or more. I would not recommend this product until Intermatic fixes the issue with the timer."
3,Works fine,Just got it and it works out of the box. Of course most would want to know how durable it is and such. That will come in time.
1,"Timer runs fast, an hr/day!","Nice little timer, replacing a similar outdoor timer I had for years which finally died. Unfortunately it seems to run fast by at least an hr every day, cumulatively. So, by the end of the week we are now approximately 7 hrs fast. I will buy another unit, hopefully I'll have better luck."
4,broken part,"Works great, but taking it out of the box one of the tips that the top hooks to was broken. Using it anyway."
5,Don't cook with it!,This book is great for the new cook as well as the experienced. I found it to have many basic recipes as well as involved recipes. The variety was incredible. Something as basic as Bechamel Sauce to a recipe for Gnocchi. Every kitchen & cook needs this book .
3,religious,I found this to be a good book foruse in my religious ed program for the older children. It helps me with the younger children but too deep for them
1,WAAAAAY overpriced for what it is.,There is quite literally more plastic in a McDonalds happy meal toy. so Why on EARTH IS THIS $30???????????? Because the company is a greedy company that is trying to leech as much cash from their customers as possible. I thought I'd get this for my 2 year old but he can already bar a chord now so it is useless. do yourself a favor and just learn the friggin' guitar already. It's not that hard. Are you telling me my two year old is cooler than you???
1,Umm....,"Am i the only one completely disgusted that this product even exists? I guess it goes along with the poser Guitar Hero craze, wouldn't surprise me if Matthew Bellamy owns one, the song stealing, single string dwelling git."
2,Hard Chord,Does not work on my electric guitar. I can't get clear chords. I tried to set it uo as good as I could but still doesn't play clear when I push the buttons.
3,GOOD FOR BEGINNERS,Works just fine for beginners If you adjust it just right. Gave it to my brother and he loved it.
2,E_Z Chord,I didnt care to much for this one. It did not fit my guitar very well. I had to send it back.
2,inaccurate directions,"I have not had enought time to fully explore functionality of this product, but was disappointed to find that the directions for tuning the guitar and incorrect. They say to use the 6th fret of each string to tune the next (except for the 5th for the b string), when it should use the 5th fret with the 4th for the b string. I figured it out easy enough, but could see it being challening for people without a guitar background."
2,Waste of money,"Neat little toy for a kid to play with thinking he/she may become the next country music star. I think it was designed specifically for acoustic guitars, not electric. The (vocal instruction) CD that came with it also indicates that it was meant for country-style music and the thick Oklahoma-accented instructor did not not impress me with his musical intelligence. The product feels very cheap as well. I don't wanna tighten the screws too much in fear that the POS will break thru the plastic threading. I don't recommend this unless your kid wants to pretend and you have a Jackson you want to waste."
2,E-Z Chord,Gave this as a gift (I already had one and love it). Found out months later that it never owrked right. I examined it and found that it is defective and doesn't line up properly on the strings like it should. Figured it was too late to do anything about and forgot where I ordered it from.
4,Ez chord,"I haven't played the guitar in awhile and my fingers are a little stiff. This gave me the ability to play chords, again and have fun playing! Thanks"
4,EZ chord,"The EZ Guitar chord does work to a point. I can get it set so chords 1,2,and 3 work pretty well. Once those three are working it becomes difficult to make the # 4 chord. It seems that the #4 chord will not press the 5th (A) string down enough. I can manipulate it enough to make it work, but that takes time and during chord changes time is one thing you do not have much of. Still if you're like I am and have a deformed arm that prevents you from making chords with your fingers the EZ chord is about the only way to play, unless you want to learn to play the steel, or dobro guitar. Neither of which are rhythm guitars. I give it 4 stars simlpy because it does give me the ability to play at least three chords."
4,Movie? I don't think so.,"This wasn't a movie... it was the 3 eps rolled into one tape. It kind of sucked that way too, seeing as I already owned the first two tapes. But otherwise, I love the series... it's just too bad they had to rip you off this way."
1,Boring beyond all belief...,"It's hard sometimes to describe what exactly it is that makes a show lousy. Is it mediocre dialog? Lackluster action sequences? Lifeless and uninteresting characters? So-so animation? Or how about a incredibly unoriginal clique-ridden (slapped together)plot that puts you to sleep? In other words, this anime is just plain bad, and there's nothing really to redeem it from that status. No compelling characters, no cool designs, no great music, nothing. Save your money and skip this one. There's better stuff out there."
4,Mom's boston terrier is nuts for this lizard!,"I bought this little guy for my mom's boston terrier puppy and it is now her favorite toy. The boston chewed through it pretty quickly, but loves it nonetheless."
1,My dog is terrified!,"My Yorkie is terrified of this toy...even when it isn't squeeking! It has a very rubbery smell too, which may be part of the turn off. She usually loves noisy toys and this is the first toy that she truly hasn't liked."
4,Happy Dog!,"This is my dog's 3rd lady bug, as he just loves them! This one is a bit bigger and heavier than the previous ones, (I don't know if I selected a different size) but this is my 16 pound poodle's favorite toy to play toss with."
3,Spooky Pink Elephant,"I have 3 papillons, and one loves squeaky toys, but they were all scared of this pink elephant. My bigger, male papillon finally attacked it, but the elephant sits, untouched since. I think it may be the sound of the squeak, that they didn't like."
2,Not for a large puppy,Very cute toy...but we have a 60lb. 9 month old puppy who ate the tongue and tail with great relish....so guess this is best suited for an older dog or one who is not so into chewing!!!
5,Dog's Best FRIEND!,"We have a large male golden that is now a destructive chewer. This was one of his first toys and stayed in tact for almost a year. He takes it everywhere like it's his best friend. I have ordered a new one, b/c the chameleon is his fav, but we also have the octopus and dragon, which are still in tact. This toy is a great value for the price, and the dog loves squeezing it to see the tongue unroll."
3,"got this same exact dragon in Jr version... dog loved it, but destroyed in 2 days.","I have a 7 month old schnoodle. He's only 10 lbs but while he's been teething he's been capable of destroying everything! He was initially very careful with this dragon. He would creep up to it and lick its tongue.. then run away when we squeezed it and the tongue flipped out.. after some introduction, he was all over this thing. Absolutely loved it. 1 day later we looked at the poor dragon and his tongue was missing! and one of his toes were gone too... :( I thought it would be more durable then it was.. I'm sure our puppy ended up eating these missing rubber parts despite our careful supervision. Also, we were concerned about the make/ coloring of the dragon. This was made in China? is there a possibility of lead in the coloring? (flashback; all the toy recalls in china).. Our puppy never got sick or anything, just our paranoid thoughts. anyway, though our puppy loved it, this is why I gave it only 3 stars."
5,Premier Latex Elephant,"This is such a cute toy, my dog loves it! She uses all her toys as a fetch toy and does that with this too, but she also likes playing with it on her own."
2,DON.T RECOMMENDED,MY PUPPY 18 MONTHS BYTE THE LEGS OF THE TOY AND CUT AND BROKEN TO EASY THE SOUND STILL BUT NO MORE LEGS IN 5 MINUTES
4,"""Tell me you love me...""","Sherrybaby starring the extraordinary Maggie Gyllenhaal is difficult to watch but it made a lasting impression on me. Gyllenhaal's fearless and childlike performance is what makes this film worth seeing, she plays Sherry who has been released from prison and is trying to rebuild her relationship with her young daughter. Her daughter is living with her brother Bobby and his wife and Sherry wants to do right for her daughter but obstacles and old habits creep back up again. This film isn't perfect and the ending isn't cut and dry but Sherrybaby doesn't sugarcoat or preach, it's raw and seething."
2,Awful!,"I don't know why this film got so many positive reviews. Other than Giancarlo Esposito's excellent portrayal of Sherry's parole officer, this movie has little to offer.Sherry fresh out of prison for stealing to buy drugs, is willing to have sex with anyone whether it is a man giving her a job or her rooming house supervisor. I found several of these scene distasteful. Meanwhile Sherry is trying to reconcile with her daughter after being away in prison. Her daughter is now living with Maggies brother and his wife. This is the only redeeming aspect of the movie and the only reason why I gave it any stars at all."
2,"So, so. Plot was never established...","Plot was never established, so the entire flow of the movie, as the viewer I felt was ""in constant waiting"" for it to start.Acting was excellent!The script and the flow definitely was lacking.Subject matter is important to address and the movie made good points, but again, certainly lacked in content.I would have liked to have known it was as sexually graphic as it is.As the movie was difficult to follow, I am left with many questions...too many. I realize the ending was left with a lot of unknowns which enables the characters to portray reality and truth, but this movie left the viewer with too many unanswered questions to qualify as a good movie or as a movie period."
3,Slow and distrubing but wonderful acting,Again Maggie Gyllenhaal impresses with her acting ability. This was a very strong role in an slow movie. Not much is said other than how hard life is after getting out of jail.
4,Wonderful Movie,Maggie Gyllenhaal is great in this movie. She plays a down and out single mother trying to earn her place in her child's life. This movie brings you into Sherry's life and breaks your heart along the way.
5,Awesome!,"I love, love, love this movie. I had to buy it so I could share it with others. It depicts an accurate picture of what addiction does to a person, their life, and the lives of those involved with them. Thanks!"
3,Nice Film,I thought this was a nice little film and I really liked it. I had never heard of it and a friend recommended it. I went out and bought it and I am glad I did. It isn't a great movie and it isn't full of big laughs or big action or CGI or anything like that. It is just an interesting character study of a woman who is down on her luck and who is trying to regroup and trying to change her ways. Maggie Gyllenhaal was perfectly cast as Sherry and she was great in the performance. Danny Trejo was just wonderful and cast against his usual 'heavy' type and shows a lot of range and ability. I hope to see him in other sensitive and character roles.
4,Addiction,This is a very honest movie about how abuse begins and where it could land you. Sherry has a lust for life and no place to take it. In the beginning of the film; you see how hard the girl is trying to do the right thing but always misses the goal. When you reach the end of the movie- you know why she never seems to be able to get ahead in her life. Acting was steller.
3,NOTHING SPECIAL!...BUT NOT BAD!,"The lead(Gyllenhall)gives a very good performance,but I was not overly impressed. I've seen better movies of this nature. It is worth a rental,but I wouldn't buy it."
2,lame story,story's not very interesting... character development very mediocre... not sure what's the purpose of this movie
2,Irresponsible Mommy,Maggie's small and droopy boobies aren't anything to write home about and neither is this trite movie.
3,Like watching a car wreck...,"Although I couldnt keep my eyes off the screen wondering what was going to happen next, it was more in the way of watching a car accident take place than watching a great film. It almost reminded me of a documentary from the ""real life"" stand they took with it all. DEFINATELY NOT A FAMILY MOVIE. The movie is based on a self destructive drug addict recently released from prison, who struggles with life after prison: getting on her feet, keeping clean, prostitution, sex addiction, and even shows some not so comfortable scences of her being a victim of incest from her father. I liked the movie from the aspect that I feel it grips to reality and the real struggles of someone in her shoes; it's no fairytale with a easy ending. I personally will not suggest this movie."
3,Very Crazy,"You've seen Monster and thought it was a fantaastic film. Imagine an imperfect monster with one of your favourite actresses, Maggie. The film is a watered down Monster and there are many disturbing things about the character's life.On the DVD cover, one finds a strong and independent woman, this I found to be a bit misleading. I know many people have recommended this film to me and it's the sort of film that sits right down my alley but there is absolutely no hope I saw in this film of recovering from it's misery.The storyline is just sad and though it's been played out quite well my Maggie Gylenhaal, I feel I could've lived without this film and this would be my least favourite Maggie Gyl film.I would recommend you renting this but it's not something you'd own and ever watch again. And if you would, I would consider throwing a quarter of affection in your direction, love."
4,Glimpse into a tortured life,"Fresh out of prison, Sherry Swanson struggles to put her life back together. She only knows how to survive by using sex to manipulate and has a difficult time gaining any self respect or a sense of self worth. Damaged emotionally from her father's molestation, she doesn't know how to relate to men other than sexually. She wants to re-connect and protect her daughter, but she has no confidence in her mothering skills. Sherry can barely take care of herself and stay off drugs, but she does have friends who help her limp along. The movie can get slow in places, but it's a realistic drama that brings us into the real battles of a former drug addict clawing her way up from the gutter.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
4,Scary,"Maggie Gyllenhaal played her part to perfection, scarily so. She's the perfect sociopath, only thinking of herself while using her daughter, as well as anyone else she encounters, as a foil. She's a master manipulator and feels no remorse for using anyone unlucky enough to cross her path.All in all a real slice of life film accurately depicted, directed and played."
2,Fine performance ruined by too much sex,"Without doubt Maggie Gyllenhaal gives an outstanding performance as Sherry (with the title as a take off on the old song, ""Sherry Baby""?) However, I couldn't even finish the film after the 5th or 6th gratuitous sex scene. My wife was completely bored since she is not a fan of bleak films or independent films, for that matter.As a great fan of foreign films, Fellini, Bergman, Truffaut, etc.; I have no problem with slow paced films or steamy sex in moderation but why do they have to do it to the point that it takes away from some fine performances such as the brother, sister-in-law, daughter and the Indian ex-addict who befriends Sherry, all fine performances by strong actors?So they should give Maggie and the other actors awards and send the director and/or editors of this film back to film school!"
5,Compelling,Something about Galway Kinnell makes you see death for what it is and find peace in that acceptance. His poems characterize the modern push for speed and excess as a search for stillness or contentment. I love the collection.
1,Not too inspiring.,"Yes there are 150 ideas in this particular book, but I found very few ideas interesting and most ideas too far-fetched for my taste. The book also defines minimal start-up fees ranging from $500-$1,000. Is that minimal? A majority of the qualifications needed to run these ideas require some sort of formal training, so you can't just get up and go. The book also claims that most of these prospective business ideas might be already aquired hobbies...I don't think so. Most of the ideas are far-fetched and truthfully lame, which I'm sorry to say was a big upset. I'm not inspired, just disappointed I have to purchase another book."
2,Less than great,"This book touches on the surface of providing helpful information, but it is too short and does not provide enough depth to be useful."
4,Western Civilization School Book,Received the book in a timely manner. Condition not entirely what was described. Would consider doing business again - but would ask specific questions.
4,It's Just A Textbook?!?,"I am taking the class AP European History, and I have to admit it is a very comprehensible textbook. However, it is just a TEXTBOOK! The other people that have written reviews of this book need to be locked up! I mean one girl said she begged her parents to get it for her for Christmas, and another guy said this book was better than sex! Judging by where these people are from I can see they should be easily amused. I can't understand what these people are getting at. If you take the European History class, this book is a requirment. Unless you're taking the class I can't imagine anybody buying this thick book. And if you are a person that likes to read textbooks for fun you should have yourself committed!"
5,Western Civi.,Book came as described. arrived on time. also had no choice needed the book for class. This is for a class I need to take for a BSN
4,Good,the contents are well-organized. Illustrated with colorful images. information is useful. An essential book for your history course and an interesting book to read in rainy days.
3,One of Fast's Better Efforts,"As Synergy, Larry Fast has produced an impressive body of work as a contemporary American electronic composer. Cords is one of his better attempts to go beyond the sterile technical flash of the Wendy Carlos school of classical electronic music and manages to achieve some interesting results, particularly on experimental pieces like ""Phobos and Deimos Go to Mars"" and the avant-classical trilogy ""On Presuming to Be Modern."" Ordinarily, contemporary electronic music with a thick, lingering classical aura is overblown and pretensious. Cords can--and does, at times--fall prey to such faults. Still, it's worth a listen for fans of the post-Switched-on Bach generation and for aficianados of synthesizers."
1,A disgruntled socialist,"The author is disappointed, that socialism failed, despite all the ""intellectuals"", who considered it the right way.Rather than simply admitting defeat, Mr. Birnbaum finds many explanations, why it had not succeded, yet.His story is a boad sweep through the 20th century. Lack of scholastic methods are ""compensated"" by some of the most difficult language, I have ever read (I am not a native speaker of the English language, so you may discount this comment)After about 300 tedious pages, I decided to put the book away.A great disapointment!"
1,Color does matter,"Buyer beware when they say color choice is not available. I was disappointed when I received the laundry bag. The color pictured was blue. The item I received was pink. Since this was intended to be a humorous gift for a young man, the color was inappropriate. As I received the wrong product/unacceptable substitute, I requested a full refund. However, the shipping fees of $5.75 are non-refundable. Organize.com apparently does not want their customers satisfied at all levels. I would not recommend ordering this product as sometimes color does matter."
4,Have I missed a slam on KPMG or is it coming?,"I've not yet read the entire book; however, I am hopeful that he slams KPMG, because if they do to companies what they do to their employees, then it can be assured that they are RUINING businesses.I worked for KPMG after a couple of multi-year stints at a couple of Fortune 500 companies. On more than one occassion at KPMG, I was not paid on payday. When I asked HR what the %^&# was going on, they explained it to me thusly: ""It's like a case of the cobbler's son who has no shoes."" Well, folks, that doesn't pay the rent or the car payment on time! Yes, I should have spoken with a top-notch Silicon Valley employment attorney, but rather than hassle it, I went on to greener pastures. I'm just glad that someone is finally telling the truth about these so called experts who can't even run their own companies!"
4,Think twice - Outstanding reminder,"Dangerous Company is a book which shows out the known fact: If the management itself don't know what to do - well, you are in deep **it. Consultancy is consultancy. Sideman is a Sideman.If they take a firm grip from your nosering you are on a expensive Macig Mystery Tour. This book is worth reading especially for Devil's Advocates A.K.A. Human Resource and Business Development Executives."
4,Armed with advice and Dangerous,"This book is a look by two journalists who have sifted thru lots of cases to bring to the front examples of management consultants bringing ruin (and in one case prosperity) to their clients. It also tries to chart the future of consulting industry and where it takes the rest of corporate world.Written in a racy style it takes a look at the firms which defined consulting, right from people like James Oscar mcKinsey to Bain and the companies they started...their differentiators etc.The authors come to the conclusion that giving a carte blanche job to a consulting firm will only make them more dangerous :-) They suggest that to manage a firm you need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the firm and therefore need to focus them.But undoubtedly this book is great information on the persona and history of the specific consulting firms like McKinsey, Andersen Consulting (now Accenture), Bain & Co., Gemini Consulting, BCG etc."
3,Value based services: The future for smaller consultancies,"If you read between the lines of this book carefully, listen to the discussions between clients and consultants, and hear what CEO's and senior managers talk about, there is only one conclusion. Value based services will be a growth industry."
2,It ain't necessarily so...,"As an insider for one of the firms highlighted in the book, I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the authors spin their stories to provide the highest possible shock value. Of course selling more books is their goal. Unfortunately, presenting a fair and balanced report often falls short of that goal...so just leave out the contradictory evidence and go to press. In all my years in the industry, I have never seen consultants independently ""destroy"" a company. However, I have seen many, many poor business decisions that were made by corporate management and blamed on others."
1,Superficial and naive.,"O'Shea and Madigan have tried to take a few ""war stories"", court documents, and interviews with consulting PR-types to generalize about how clients should deal with consultants. It's a 50,000 foot view that may be interesting to someone who's never heard the word ""consulting"" before. Revealingly, in their litany of consulting horror stories, they somehow missed the biggest consulting disaster of the century: IBM at the FAA. Worse, their simplistic advice for clients considering consulting help is misleading and more dangerous than the company of consultants. Consider: ""If it's not broke, don't try to fix it."" Goodbye competitive advantage! ""Insist on tailor-made consulting engagements."" Hello high cost and uncertainty! If you are looking for an ""insider"" view of big-time consulting, this is not it. Hopefully, we'll someday get a definitive analysis of the multi-billion dollar consulting industry, but it probabaly won't be written by a couple of newspaper guys"
4,Interesting peek behind the curtains,"The book gives an interesting peek behind the curtains of consulting, which is for many people still very esotheric. In this sense the ""Dangerous Company"" has its merits. However, as somebody who has recently joined one of the ""big four"" consulting houses, I think the book missed out on one of the most important trends in the business, namely that consulting is moving more and more away from the classical ""write the report and run"" approach and is moving more towards a form of ""interim management"" where the consultant is brought on board of the ship to help (instead of just telling how) to steer it for a certain time. Apart from this, the book states some simple truths about how to deal with consultants, but simple truths are most often disregarded by people!"
5,A lost star,"Living in the country he loved most and which he dedicated his best songs to, I just cannot stop missing him and his music. Son of the great director Jules Dassin and step son of the actress Melina Mercouri he sang about love, dreams and places. His sudden death was a great lost. This cd contains nearly all his best songs and everyone who loves romantic french music must have it."
5,A great french language learning aide!,"This one singer helped me to learn french, and I recommend it to anyone doing so. His lyrics and pronunciation are very clear, and the music is excellent! There are several songs that are a remake of american songs in french in this particular album, but there are many others that are very french (you'll like them in no time)There's one song in english, though (The guitar don't lie)"
4,THE SON OF A MOVIE DIRECTOR,"If there is a singer well suited to a greatest hits album,it is JOE DASSIN who was always snobed by most critics, but fortunally for him, the public loved him.JOE DASSIN was a hit maker, and i see nothing wrong with that because a singer after all wants to be heard right?.This is the type of record you can put in your cd to relax after a hard day. Hits with nothing too deep."
2,not for someone looking to sweat,"Its an ok dvd. its good if your looking for breathing techniques and something to help you get your abs stronger. but if your looking for a good workout, to work up a sweat not so much. i am also only 12 weeks so i might feel a little different when im further along."
2,"Well done survey, but not a rational justification of faith","The main premise of this book is that it is as rational to believe in God as to believe in the existence of other minds, this is false. In principle, it is impossible to, by pure reason, justify belief in anything other than our own selves, yet we live by more than just pure reason alone, we believe in the existence of other minds beyond our own because we are compelled by experience to believe, but we are not at all compelled into believing in God's existence. Only to the person who is naturally inclined to belief in God does the existence of God seem obvious, to a true atheist, thw world and our place in it looks like a world without God. I am writing this review because I am offended as a believer in God (although someone who is outside of any traditional religion) that people still try to justify, by reason and science, faith in God, that is why we call it FAITH, because it is not supported by reason or science."
1,Wrong is wrong.,"Wrong's wrong. All the sophisticated argumentation in the world won't change that. Doctrines and mere theism simply do not deserve the elevated status of axioms or a priori true basic beliefs. The fact that unlike actually agreed upon axioms, theism is not universally agreed on as a self evident truth should be sufficient to make that clear."
3,"honestly, somewhere between 3 and 5","I know I originally gave this CD five stars, but that was within the context of avant garde music. If you want something truly wild, strange and obscure, Mira Calix the artist I recommend for the genre. There's some good variety on this CD. Some of the tunes are a bit scary. She has an intriguing voice, and has some exotic beats. This woman tends to compose like she has ants in her pants. One track sounds like joyful bees in a windtunnel. Don't expect to throw this kind of CD on all the time, though, as one of your ""soundtracks"" for everyday life ... it is too distant and off-kilter for that. Not recommended for driving. Listening to this while lying on the couch on a lazy, sunny Saturday afternoon suits the experimentation and occasional paranoia of this disc best. Recommended for when your mind wants to take a leisurely hike in some fresh weeds. Don't pass up seeing her live in concert, though. She was great!"
5,Great book to learn hematology,"Hematology is a complex subject, often with very variable and confounding clinical presentations. Trying to learn this subject by the conventional approach of reading pages upon pages of dense, dry text describing pathophysiology, symptoms and signs is often overwhelming and unrewarding. The approach of this text, using case presentations, followed by analysis and didactic commentary, to teach the subject makes it memorable, interesting, and gives the reader a 'real world' sense of grasp and mastery. The book is comprehensive, and despite being an anthology with multiple authorship, the chapters progress well and are clearly written. Definitely the book for this subject."
5,The most important book that I have ever read.,Bobby Sands: Writings from Prison is the most important book that I have ever read. In my opinion it is the most inspiring testament of courage ever to be put onto paper. Sands vividly describes what it was like to be on the H-Blocks of Long Kesh. His description of the conditions in which these brave men lived and died in would strike a nerve in any person that calls himself human. Humorous and sad at the same time this book changed my whole entire thought process on certain social issues.
1,Another glorification of murder,Easy audience in dumb Irish American lobby. Sands was a terrorist thug and his writings the work of an evil man. Why are people in this country so quick to support terrorists in Ireland? Don't you remember the Oklahoma bombing? Sands and McVeigh are cut of the same cloth.
5,This book is a very engaging . . .it's awesome.,"This book is a very fascinating, I love it! It is one of the best books I've read. Believe me, I've read a lot of books! I would recommend this book to female young adult readers . . .especially if you're interesting in Indians, and even if you're not! A great view inside the world of this girl. *****"
2,This is a fabulous novel about Native American life.,"Matcheck has created a fabulous novel about Native American life. The young Apsaalook girl is a most determined and dynamic character. The plot of this novel is so authentic and exciting it makes you want to keep on reading. The many experiences she goes through teaches her and the reader many things about life. It is a very real and touching story. This book is one I would consider to be greatly inspiring, especially to the female reader. I would highly recommend this book to any young adult reader. Even though I am not an avid reader of this genre, I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
2,The Sacrifice,"I gave The Sacrifice 2 stars. I didn't really like the book. I didn't like the tpoic of the book. The plot was very un believable. There wasn't much action or adventure. It was just like someone was telling you a story.I would recommend my book to kids fourteen and older. I recommend the book to people this age was so that they could read and comprehend what is going on in the story. Also,they need to have an intrest in native americans. If you don't have an intrest in Native Americans ( like me) then you can't enjoy the book."
4,Survivor Series 2007 A Good Show,I think this years survivor series surpassed last years due to the fact it had two big time main events in randy orton vs michaels and Taker vs Batista HITC Dream match for many. It was good seeing randy orton and shawn have a pure wrestling match and the ending was also very good to me Ecw also had their best ppv by far all the competiors looked good and no one knew who was gonna win good show for the young stars the HITC with taker and batista was also good but the crowd seemed a bit dead maybe because of the awe of it but regardless these two had a battle hard fought it was a little cheap but Im sure this one aint over quite yet all in all this ppv was worth the money and one I will add to the collection now I just cant wait till the rumble -Robert V.
4,Better than the Rest!,"This year really sucked, PPV speaking for WWE. Overall, if you want to buy DVDs, you should get, Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, Survivor Series, and Armageddon.This is Ok, very enterteining, buy I definitely expected more from the WWE Championship, rather than just Blowing the match.Also, the Hell in the Cell was blown.Im not going to buy to see the blowouts over and over."
5,The Definitive Book on F-4 Production and Use,"Over five thousand F-4's were built by McDonnell in St. Louis. Most of the birds are no longer in use, but some are still flying and will be flying on the 50th anniversary of the plane. It began as an all-weather fleet defense interceptor for the US Navy, but will be remembered most as the mainstay of the Air Force operations in Vietnam.This book is the exhaustively researched records of what happened to each of the planes that were built. It includes the McDonnell build information and more on the planes lives. Most of the data is in tabular form, you can't put too much about each of the 5,000 planes in only 360 pages.And of the 360 pages, about sixty of them are beautiful four color photographs showing more imaginative paint jobs than you can imagine.This book is going to remain the definitive report on the construction and operational use of the F-4."
3,Do you require a record of Phantom?,"I think it is not a real book, is a record of Phantom. Why? As you know, record is dry, but it can supply complete information about per Phantom, for example their final fate. I can tell you it can do that. And it includes all US Phantom air to air combat record and lost. But if you want to look for many pictures or drawings, it is not a good choice. And it cannot supply detail of Phantom. But some representational pattern is including in it. If it can combine with another Phantom book, ""Phantom, spirit in sky"", the new book will be a perfect book. I give three star because I don't know how many people can accept its record style."
3,Overall nice quality not 100% sure authentic,I ordered these and compared them to the same pair I purchased at Nordstrom (for a lot more $$$). Overall they felt really well made but the lenses seemed to have very tiny inclusions or almost air bubble type spots. I kept cleaning them and putting them on but the lenses never seemed to have the clarity I expected. Could be just an off pair; purchase and return went very smoothly. Thank you Amazon!
5,Want to know if that $20 is counterfeit?,"This is a great little tool, compact and powerful. It's useful anywhere you need a little bit of UV light. I can see stores keeping one behind a register to quickly check currency (US paper currency has markings that flouresce under UV light). Most state IDs and credit cards also have UV markings that are hard to counterfeit. Mechanics can use this to check for leaks in your AC (when phosporescent die si introduced to the system). Forensic document examiners may use this to check for differences in ink.It's inexpensive, highly portable, and works well. If you need a limited UV light, this is the tool for you."
1,Disappointed,The light is indescernable in normal household lighting. You have to be in a totally dark room to see the small circle of light. The packaging says the LED is visible at distances upwards of a mile - ha - there is NO way you could see this from across any normally lit room much less a quarter mile in the dark. It is totally ineffective unless you are on your hands and knees in a totally dark room. I regret buying it.
2,Did not work very well,This particular pen did not have a long distant beam as my old one did. After a short period of time the batteries did not last no time. I am still looking for a good pen with some long distant beam. Any suggestions from anyone appreciated?
4,"Good, but could be brighter.","The UV light is of average brightness, and overall it seems like a sturdy, high-quality product. However, I subtracted 1 star because I found another UV pen light that is even brighter for half the price ($10 vs $19) - that product is a children's toy! It's strange that a cheap, plastic children's toy UV light should be brighter than a sophisticated-looking ""adult"" UV light.If you want a brighter light, check out that toy: it's the ""Secret Agent File: Including amazing invisible ink pen!"" (Hardcover) by Moira Butterfield (Author), Tony Potter (Designer)However, perhaps this product will be longer-lasting than the children's version."
1,Here we go again,1991 technical building manual. code has been revised twice since then. useless. by the way check out amazons policy on dispute with marketplace sellers!! no involvement. grea t policy huh.Amazon.com should require that all technical books state date of publishing. And no when I bought it it did not say out of print.!!
5,Holds a lot of weight.,Strong well made steel that is easy to assemble and I intend to buy a third one for my wife.
5,Love it!,"Everything about this garment rack is perfect. The manufacturer sent it out quickly and i'm not sure what these other people are talking about the assembly. I am a 24 year old petite woman and had NO trouble putting this together without an instruction manual. Maybe I'm just good at putting stuff together or maybe they're just really NOT good at putting stuff together. Also, the second rack is flexible. You can place it wherever you want. I can see how if someone is a larger person, it might have to be lower, but the top rack is also extendable. Either way, like I said this garment rack is awesome."
2,Good quality but not tall enough,"Height of uprights is too short to accomodate adult garments on both rail using standard hangers. Needs at least 4"" more in height."
3,not for taller people,"This is a very sturdy clothing rack. Unfortunately, I stand 6ft 2in and i cannot fit two full rows of clothing. The vertical capacity is limited by the ""Z"" bar and by the space taken by the hangers. I bought a few hanging shelves to store shoes in for the bottom half."
3,Just As Advertised!,"Large Casters are terrific. Hard floors, carpet, smooth moves. Strong across the span and carries unbalanced loads without a problem. I like it. My wife put it together in 15 minutes."
5,Hanging rack is fabulous.,"I don't understand why people say this is difficult to assemble. I found it very easy to assemble. It is very high quality, and heavy. Glad I bought it."
1,Criss sucks.,Ever since getting booted from KISS this guy can't find a tune to save his life. Garbage.
1,Lame,"Very, very, VERY lame book. I bought it looking for funny one-liner jokes to take to the office to stir the pot a little. This whole book has about 2 good ones."
5,Great Handlebar,"I was looking for a handlebar for my mountain style bike that would allow me to sit up straight, easing my back issues. This bar was inexpensive and fills the need. It seems quite sturdy, although I mainly ride on bike paths rather than off road."
5,Decent Handlebar,Put it on my wife's bike and it works fine. Makes bike riding more comfortable. I have no problems with this product.
4,A Reluctant Rave!,"This book was written by an iconoclastic lama. I read it twicebefore I sold it (and you're not supposed to sell dharma books!).The author gives the outlandish belief that the rules of thevinaya (monastic order) were simply created so that they couldget along with one another! And had nothing to do withcause-and-effect karma! So much for the Gelukpa Order ofTibetan Buddhism. Nevertheless, his chapter on the useof alcohol to hasten enlightenment and his account of a lamastopping rain in his prescence are incredible! Well worthreading even if you disagree. Meditation techniques aregood, but a little too advanced. The author also refersto having moral precepts as being ""drag factors"". They dragdown altruistic intent. I belong to the Gelukpa Order so Ishould be giving this book one star. But I recommend it foreveryone. Priceless information contained inside. He willalso stop you from using an alarm clock with a button thatdelays your awake by ten minutes! Just read it."
5,Larry Fast does it again,"This album is as good or better than ""Electronic Realizations for Rock Orchestra"" Larry Fast makes electronic music sing."
2,Received NOT as Pictured,"First of all, I waited over a week to receive the product and I am not used to that with Amazon fulfilled products. The two ink cartridges (HP96) did not come in their original commercial box as pictured, but in a small cardboard box. The cartridges were, however, in their original plastic wrap with the HP logo. The dilema is the expiration date. The commercial box shows that information and the plastic inner wrap does not, so I do not know if I received an already out of date product or close to it, so red flags rise as to why they sent them this way; even the alpha/numeric codes on the plastic wrap are somewhat smudged out!! Also, I should note that the vendor I received the product from is not the one mentioned here. What's up? Now I have to go through the process of talking with Amazon to see what we can do. Not that happy right now."
2,Suspect a knock-off,The two cartridges came loose in a shipping box; NOT in the dual box pictured. There is NO indication of any expiriation date to be found on the wrappers. I suspect that these Malaysian products are a knock-off.
2,The Second one failed,"Don't buy these thing from these people. The first of the twin pack worked fine, the second one failed-streaky lines. I would say it was a fluke but I just had the same experience with the a 901XL which I bought from them for another printer. The stuff they are selling is either defective, and the time period for returning is too short. Buy most things on line, but from now on I am going to buy it it in a store, where I can take it back. You should do the same."
2,Not worth it!,"I ordered HP 96 double pack. Late one night when I was writing a paper due the next morning, I ran out of ink and pulled out these replacements. They had sent 98 instead!! Such a pain to go to the store and get the right ones at the last minute. The customer service lady was nice and apologetic and sent out replacements. I just tried the replacements and the first one did not print well! The second one is working but the low price is not worth all this hassle and worry."
5,great price on ink for my all in one printer,This set of ink cartridges for my printer was a great price and defintely the genuine product. Very happy with my purchase.
5,Great price for me..,Original ink supply at a great price. I live in the Dominican Republic and usually deskjet inks cost a lot. I am saving 50% for this bundle.
5,Easy way to buy toner,It's just toner so there isn't much to say. The price was reasonable and the product shipped promptly. I'm satisfied and will order toner through Amazon again.
5,"On time, as promised","On time, and as promised. Best deal I could find after much research. Works as advertised. Recommend."
4,"Nice, but....","The wells aren't quite deep enough for the sticks....hard to get chocolate to cover stick without running out of mold. I would get them again, because they are cute and were a big hit!!"
3,try Something to Write Home About instead.,"There is little emotion on the new Get Up Kids album. It was a disappointment. If you're looking for their old, poignant sound, check out ""Something to Write Home About."""
3,not bad but try earlier stuff if you're new to the guk,"a lot of people are saying that this album is a return for the get up kids to their earlier (pre-on a wire) stuff. i would disagree on some levels. this album doesn't hold a candle to red letter day/woodson ep's, or something to write home about, or even four minute mile. however, it's an improvement on on a wire, to be sure. the songs on guilt show are much faster, catchier and more power-poppy and in that way, it is a throwback to their earlier stuff. however, it lacks the raw emotional quality of the earlier lp's and ep's. if you're new to the get up kids, i recommend something to write home about. however, if you're a tried-and-true guk fan, i wouldn't pass this album up; it's pretty good. i just can't see it as a soundtrack to my life like stwha and the red letter day/woodson ep's once were."
3,I Hope it just needs getting used to...,"Ok Ok Ok, Ive been a GUK's fan for a long time, and like another review for this album, I was kinda dissapointed!!!! I mean (((SOMETHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT....even the change of sound of ON A WIRE))) are still in my cd player today!!!! But i dont know about this one. Its like all fast, like all the songs on (((Guilt show))) are like all the fast ones on (((Something to write home about))) The first song is good, but I dont know all the other ones just seem like they dont grab me!!!!! Soooo, Im hoping in do time that I get used to it, I kinda had this problem with (((ON A WIRE))).....but I was prtty disapointed.... There just wasn't any of those catchy hooks, or sing along choruses that TGUK's are so GREAT for...if you dont own any of the (((NEW AMSTERDAMS))) or the previous albums I'd go with those. YOu need those!!!!! OR (((Reggie and the Full effect))) even!!!!!!!!! :)"
4,Surprisingly good,"I walked into a Virgin Megastore today and this album was in the new releases. I had never heard of this band and I always like to discover new sounds. I gave this a listen and immediately purchased the CD. Many times there will be regrets in making an impulse buy like that, but the CD gets better and better every time I listen to it. Track 3, ""Never be Alone"", should be a hit, but unless this band is discovered by more, they may slip into oblivion like so many other bands...Do yourself a favor and listen to this album. If you like it, buy it! Support these guys."
5,nice looking hinges,"I was redoing a bathroom where the cabinet doors are secured with demountable hinges. These are somewhat odd (your local Home Depot, Lowes, OSH, etc. does not stock these) so I ended up on the internet where you can find just about anything. I bought them through Amazon because I knew that if I had to return them I could do so without any hassles. Well I did not have to return them as they fit just fine. They look great and they work great. What more can you ask for?"
4,Works great for us!,"We bought this to replace a Rowenta toaster that was also long and narrow, but never worked well. Our choices were limited as it needed to fit in a narrow space behind our cooktop.This looks lovely in the kitchen and toasts evenly. The variety of settings works well for various breads, although it will take some practice with different bread types to see which setting is best for each. The default setting is fine for standard bread. Crank it up for bagels or rye bread.In response to another review, the toaster doesn't wait 10 seconds before starting to toast. It gives you 10 seconds to change the setting after putting the bread in, but it begins to heat right away.We are very satisfied with this toaster compared to the four times more expensive Rowenta that was horrible!"
2,Worked as expected for 6 months,"Since this model was about the only long-slot toaster (for rye bread) available at a reasonable price, I took a chance and purchased it in April.The only two problems I had with it the first 6 months were:1. It REALLY pops the bread out. Completely out of the toaster. Not good, when your bread lands in the floor.2. It has the same crumb-catcher design that many toasters now have. Is that to keep the outside from getting hot, or just for so-called 'looks'? They are very hard to keep clean in any case.Now, after six months, a third problem has come up. It burns the toast. No matter what setting I use. Don't you just love electronic controls?So I now have a unit that is difficult to clean, and flings burnt toast out onto the floor."
4,So far so good,"+Toasts!+Looks sexy.+Love the crumb tray and the cord wrap. Re-heat is also a nice little feature. Have yet to try defrost.-Buttons feel a little cheap on the front.?Why the cooling rack? Whenever I toast something in any toaster, its cold in about 5 seconds flat. The cooling rack is a useless accessory for me.?Have to turn up fairly high to toast bread. Assuming this is because the coils are farther apart to account for bagels."
4,Attractive Toaster,"Happy with this toaster. Nice design. Easy to spot how much longer the toast will take by a series of bright, blue lights. Perhaps a bit slow, but a good product."
1,Ed Slidell,Purchased February 2010 died November 2010. Customer support is a joke no answer at office in NY and no response from email. This is a pure marketing organization and seemingly could care less after the sale.
1,I gave up after sending two of them back,"The first one that I ordered was DOA, it would not work at all. Amazon sent a replacement very quickly, and although it did work the center heating coils only partially worked. You got a very uneven piece of toast, one side was ok the other was half done. It was easy to see that the center coils would not heat properly.I gave up and also sent this back. Still looking for one that works, but I would not recommend this one to anyone."
2,Short Life,"I've had this toaster for under 3 months. Lightly used and carefully too, yet it jams and will not eject the toast. Will need to deal with Haier to replace. Worked well until this problem."
5,Top quality!,"This toaster fills the bill! It not only handles bakery bread that you slice yourself, it has excellent settings to get the degree of browning desired. And it really does a good job with gluten-free bread. Can't say that about any other toaster I've tried.Looks very neat on the counter, too."
3,It's a toaster. Makes toast.,"It makes great toast. Looks good too. And the countdown lights are a nice touch. My only reservation is that the increments on the browning selector are too large. There is no way to make fine adjustments in the degree of browning desired. This makes the toaster just OK in my view. That said, I have no regrets."
4,WE LIKE IT!,"I purchased this toaster because I wanted one that took up minimal counter space, was stainless to match other appliances, and could toast various breads cut to different sizes. This one is perfect for our 2 person household and it's good looks a bonus. I love the blue lights that count down the toasting time left and was surprised at how cool the exterior is while toasting. I gave it 4 stars only because this was the second one I received, the first one had some interior"" toasting"" wires that did not light up. Returning it was easy thanks to Amazon's easy return policy."
1,Slick Talker but did not Upgrade and replace defective HAIER Toaster,"After filing a complaint with this business for a defective toaster. I was contacted by some guy presumably the oner. He promised to send an upgrade . What he did instead was issue a refund. Had I of known this to be the outcome I would not have waited two weeks to get a toaster. I even took down my first review, which I do now regret. I will never do business .with him again"
5,awesome toaster,I've been super happy with this toaster. I love the long slim design and it looks so modern and clean.It works like a charm. No burnt toast here. We love it!
3,relacement toaster,"Bought on Amazon.com wanted upgrade, digital is great. Slightly longer single slot would be better for all off size breads. Cool countdown to finish, evenly toasted toast, had for one month, anticipate years of great toasting based on what have done so far."
3,Toasts pretty good!!!,"Toaster came quickly and looks real nice. Cool blue lights that countdown your toasting. The drawbacks were that it did not quite fit 2 sandwich bread slices side by side. They had to overlap slightly. Not a big deal, but worth noting. Also no specific ""Bagel"" function and the toasting eveness of denser breads was a little lacking. Really 3 -1/2 stars."
3,Multiple batches needed to be adjusted.,"We use our toaster every day, and usually make several batches at a time. The only thing we don't like about this toaster, is that after the first batch at setting 5, and the toaster heats up, all subsequent batches have to be adjusted down or they burn. It took us about a week and several slices of burnt toast to figure out the best combination of settings. First batch = level 5, Second batch = level 3, Third batch = level 2. The toaster does a nice job of toasting evenly on both sides and looks great. We were specifically looking for a single slot toaster to save on counter space."
3,"Nice looking, but uneven toasting","The toaster is very nice looking and I love how it fits long slices of bread. However, I cannot make it toast evenly. One side is always more toasted than the other. The bread is either too dark or too light. It also takes a long time to toast the bread. Overall, I think the toaster is an OK value for the price."
3,Haier TST 120ss Toaster,"ProsLooks good, has long slot which accomodates breadmaker bread.ConsDoes not toast evenly. Toasts darker on second piece than the first piece."
5,Great space saving toaster,"Works just like any good toaster...even toasting. Fits bagels and long pastries. Easy to use, I don't know how people get confused with these really...I love that it's long and skinny, it fits perfectly in my space."
3,Openly spiritist; inconceivable that this is filed under Christianity,"Eddy is one of the best-known occultists in the history of the United States. Learn about witchcraft, cults, demonology, etc. and you will quickly find a very familiar pattern which includes EVERYTHING Eddy writes.A crash course in doctrines of demons (sorcery, spiritism, etc.) is available at chick.com"
5,Mandatory reading for me:-),"If this looks complicated and long, go to page 600 and start reading from ""The Fruitaqe"" chapter. Some have been healed just reading the book~!"
1,Poor copy. Get the authorized version.,The copyright expired on Science and Health with Key to the Sriptures so anyone can print the book and sell it. This is a poor copy. It is badly formated and hard to read. The book is still published by the Christian Science publishing company who takes care to do it correctly and preserve the correct wording and formating intended by the author. The book is life changing. I would give it a 5 star rating if it were published correctly.
1,Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,This looks to me like is it not the authentic Christian Science Textbook that is authorized by The Mother Church in Boston. It does not bear the signature or cross and crown logo. Do not wish to own it. Deleted the download. I will buy the authorized copy.
4,Oliver's Progress,"The Twist tale, much like all ""classics"" is fairly well known. This edition is good because of all the extras. There are critical reviews, illustrations and a good map, and a very clear editor."
1,Pretty awful...,"I have to confess, I don't currently own this album. Why not? Because I gave it away almost as soon as I had listened to it once. I was always wary of buying Solas' material; nothing I heard from them really struck me as having a lot to do with traditional Irish music. Their sound and music selection always struck me as being more in line with a contemporary, American pop/folk band. There is no traditional dance music on the album as I recall, and the songs fall overwhelmingly outside the trad. idiom.I received this album from a local radio station as part of a giveaway and I decided to continue the trend and give it away again. And you know what? The friend to whom I gave it tried to give it back!My advice is to stay away from this album if you are looking for truly traditional Irish music. If you are into the whole contempo-folk/pop sound, then maybe this is for you."
3,"Where have you wandered off to, Solas?","My experience with Solas goes back to when I was first discovering my Irish roots. I played the heck out of their first few CD's and recently purchased their concert on DVD. In general, I am disappointed with the Irish bands that are becoming Americanized. Plugging in instruments and rock and roll drumming is not unique in the United States. Neither is Bluegrass. What has been unique over many years is the traditional Irish sound of lyrics in the original Gaelic and instruments that could be played in the deep woods around a campfire or in a pub with friends and family. I suppose that is why I am now playing Danu, John Whelan and Dervish more often."
5,I love this CD!,"A friend of mine is a somewhat-rabid Solas fan, and I finally decided to listen to soundclips of the group's music. Am I ever glad I did. ""The Edge of Silence"" is absolutely beautiful, a fusion of Celtic and modern music I haven't heard anywhere else (no doubt it exists, but...), and Dierdre Scanlan's voice is lovely. The album includes a few instrumental tracks--2, 4, 7, and 8--and although I enjoyed those I liked the other songs a bit better."
5,Excellant...,"I don't know what those other reviewers are thinking. This is a good CD. its has a lot of heart and some of the songs can at times bring tears to my eyes. I espcially love Prelude 2 and Cloths of Sand. Again, not quite sure what those other people who are condeming this CD were expecting."
1,nothing of value,"As with Runaway Dreidel, Ms Newman takes her inspiration for a Chanukah book from Xmas, not a good place to start writing a good quality book for Jewish children. So, it is not surprising that the book contains nothing of value. Neither the text nor the illustrations feel like they depict a Jewish family at Chanukah."
5,Fantastic Read,Joe Gunther does it again the series gets better and better I find the books so hard to put down once I start to read them.
2,Very slow reading...no plot twists,"A litle dull. Plodded through just to see how things were resolved. Disappointed. Maybe detective work is ponderous, monotonous and slow moving. Certainly do get that impression from reading the book."
4,A quick read.,"I was able to read this book in one evening and handed it to my husband to read... I think it's got a lot of helpful information if you've never dealt with a shy dog. The biggest problem for us and applying these methods to our shy dog is that he's over 100 lbs and not quite the same as working with the Papillon the author has. But much of it is just ""common sense"" and I DO recommend reading this book if you have a shy dog -- it's worth spending an evening if you can help your dog gain any confidence."
4,good,"Bought for a friend who has a shy dog, she said that it is helping her a lot working with her dog."
5,Clear and straight forward,I am a dog trainer and I fully endorse this little book. It is easy to read and gives some wonderful information for anyone dealling with a fearful dog.
3,Help for Shy Dogs,"The book was okay. Had some inspiring stories. I was looking for more practical strategies to deal with my very shy dog. There were some suggestions, but the book was not as much of a training tool as I had hoped. It was, however, inspirational."
3,ok book,"Okay book, a litlle disappointed since she stresses over and over training since I did that with my Ted already....many of the ideas in her book are really common sense"
4,Excellent display of a type of Monkey Boxing (i.e. Monkey variation of the Lao Family Hung Gar Kung Fu system),"I have seen quite a few movies that feature Monkey Boxing and I can honestly say that in terms of the number of Monkey Boxing fight scenes as well as the quality of each fight scene, this movie ranks amongst the best. The story line is also quite good."
1,Rotten Potatoes,"Don't waste your money on this one. I'm not even half way on this flim. I saw This film back in the early 80's. It's repackage to look like a more up to date film.. I was had... Lost money on this one... I wish I can return it.. The promoters for some of these martial art films, are using deseptive practices to make these films look more resent.. look out for those 80's films. in those days sound effects wasn't alive.. even remaster, it's still a risk.. Don't buy this movie..."
3,A fairly enteraining(if not educational) WOD anthology.,"Dark Destiny is a very twisted book. In it readers will find everything from werewolves who are controlled by the whims of their ancestor spirits to a vampire owned and established blood bottling plant that conveniently delivers its wares to local Kindred. Many of the stories were entertaining, but few held up to the way things really work in the World of Darkness. One such story shows a human who becomes a werewolf by eating a scrap of lupine flesh given to him by a friendly Garou. Totally stupid.Despite this, the stories ""Night Games"", ""One of the Secret Masters"", and ""But I Feel the Bright Eyes"" make this book worth the price of admission. ""Bright Eyes"" tells of how Edgar Allen Poe became a vampire only to battle the Kindred on their own terms. It's a wonderful story of the human spirit triumphing over the Kindred's corrupting embrace, and I was nothing less than inspired after reading that one."
1,Unimpressive,"The scholars who prepared the Literature subject test, from Central Piedmont Community College, Portland State University, Ricks College and a high school, do not sufficiently know their stuff. Students would be far better off studying the tests in the Official SAT Study Guides, or the Princeton Review series."
5,One of our favorites,Lovely book with an important reminder for kids (and adults). Great illustrations with a wonderful flow to the words.
5,Cruden's Concordance,"This was actually a gift to my son, who told me he had another concordance, but Cruden's is much better."
5,Indispensible resource.,Books like these prove that one does not have to be a trained theologian or scholar to understand and research the Scriptures. Just have access to books written by such people.
2,"fun, fun, rust, rust, rust...","We got this for our kids at Easter. It looked great and the kids really enjoyed it, including my sons friends. Unfortunately, about 2 months after we had it, it started to rust and 'bleed' down the goal post. I actually e-mailed the company of the basketball goal and never heard a word. Now swimming season is over and the goal is going to the dump. Looks terrible.Bottom line, we really enjoyed having it but the rust over rules."
2,disappointed,I was expecting a full sized hoop and rim. I was drawn to it by the all plastic base and limited steel. I should have read the details closer. I am returning.
4,A literary answer to one of life's imponderable questions.,"I was deeply moved and grateful at the way Pat Conroy writes. This was the first book of his that I have read and instantly recommended it to all of my book club friends. As a former athlete, I felt a closeness with Pat and easily related to the pains and successes the team went through. I am very appreciative that a story could be finally portrayed about what it feels like to have high expectations placed upon you only to disappoint in the end. For me, the question: ""Why do bad things happen to good people,"" was answered by Pat in the beginning when he stated: ""Life is a fiercer more uncompromising teacher cold-hearted but clear-eyed in it's understanding that life is more dilemma than game and more trial than free pass."" Finally I understand what fate was teaching me through athletics...sometimes you lose."
3,"An interesting, cathartic read","I didn't think I was going to enjoy this book--I've never read Conroy's books before, I've never attended a military school, and I don't like basketball--but I'm pleased to say I was wrong. Though Conroy does dwell on the play-by-play of ballgames a little too much (especially later in the book), I found this story of failures and triumphs to be gripping.I think Conroy wrote the book more for himself and his old team than for the average paying customer, but I didn't feel left out. Good stuff."
2,Not what you'd expect from Conroy,"Read this book after reading the editorial reviews. Typically really enjoy Conroy's style of writing and story telling. HOWEVER, a biography on this small portion of his life-his baskeball years in HS-just didn't do it for me. I realize I may be in the minority here but it seems that this book talked about the same things over and over again.......I wouldn't recommend it. Stick with Pat's fiction instead."
2,My Losing Season,"The book that I read was My Losing Season written by Pat Conroy. This book is a story about the author Pat Conroy. Pat was the starting point guard for the Citadel basketball team.As a kid Pat was raised by an abusive father who was a colonel in the marines. Pat overcame all of his problems and was a good player at Gonzaga High School. He received a scholarship for basketball at Citadel. There he was the point guard on his college team. His senior year he went through many ups and downs during the season. In the book Pat gives great detail of the games, almost making you feel like you're there. I didn't really like this book and I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone."
1,Disappointing and boring,"The review of My Losing Season in the New York Times Book Review gets this book absolutely right. That is, the book is just plain awful."
5,My Losing Season: A Memoir,"Pat Conroy is our finest wordsmith. My Losing Season made me laugh and then made me cry. By the end of his time at The Citadel, I was laughing again. He weaves a story like no other."
5,Conroy's Winning Season,"Overcoming an abusive father and an abrasive basketball coach, Pat Conroy describes his life in basketball through his senior season in college. Despite being both physically and mentally beaten by the cadet system at the Citadel and a father worse than any Conroy has previously described in his novels, Pat discovers his inner voice during what he titles his ""Losing Season."" More importantly, he begins listening to that inner voice and following it rather than the coach who screams ""don't shoot"" and the father who continually berates him. This is a story that goes beyond sports to more important issues.Well written, reads like a novel. Deserves to be read."
2,For basketball fans only,"I own every book written by Conroy. However I am NOT a basketball fan. In My loosing season, Conroy writes play by play, names basketball players, basketball teams etc. Since I know nothing about basketball, it rings no bell and leaves me cold and unconcerned. There's a bit of the old Conroy and his life's struggles in this book but not much. And we never even get a glimpse of his teammates' characters, personalities or inner lives. We only read about what kind of game they played on which night and against whom. Conroy is so good at making us care about people by bringing us into their hearts and souls yet we finish the book without knowing (nor caring) about anybody on his team or in his life at the time. All in all, it makes for a very cold, overly technical and sadly boring read."
3,"A special book, not just for sports lovers","I have never played basketball. But Conroy let me see the beauty of well-played sport, to almost feel the special thrill of coordinated athletic movement, while sitting still.He portrayed decent, loyal and loving people in a way that is touching. He put the reader into the story. This is the mark of a good book, and a good writer.By comparison The Great Santini came across as embarrassingly trite and smarmy, but that's for another review..."
4,Losing Season Review,I thoroughly enjoyed the book and completed it in three days whiich is a rarity for me. It kept me captivated and took me back to some of my own basketball and life experiences.
4,Basketball with Pat Conroy,"I love Conroy's writing and have read many of his books. This is autobiographical, not fiction, as he details his years playing basketball for the Citadel. Much that he writes has been already written in his other books and he alludes to some of those books in this one. This book goes into much detail about some of the games--a working understanding of basketball details would probably make some parts clearer. And because this book touches on so many other incidents he has written about with more detail, there is a strong sense of deja vu throughout the book. I prefer to read his fiction--there is more character development and more sense of place. His writing and vocabulary is sparkling, but not so much in this book. Still, I like reading Pat Conroy's works."
4,Wonderful!,"I am so glad that I read this book and wish mr. Conroy had even more books to read.I was hesitant to read a basketball memoir, but this was much more. The sports motif was really an allegory of so much more. I learned a lot about the author's life, education and childhood. This gave me more insight into his other novels particularly Beach Music and Lord's of Discipline (both excellent).This was so well written. Everything become lyrical when described by pat Conroy. He is so reflective, honest and insightful. I am not sure about the conversation between the author and the protagonist from Lord's of Descipline, but it was an interesting diea.I had to go back and savor passages that were just so beautitful.I loved it and thank the author for sharing so much of his spirit and craft!"
4,About life,I am not a fan of basketball. But I found this book to be more than about the game of basketball...it is about life. I'm sure many people can see themselves in this book. I highly recommend it.
2,Hating your Father as Basketball,"Having been a college basketball player eons ago, I looked forward to this book. My mid-point, I was forcing my self to read it. In his previous books he tells us how much he hates his father. This book is just another chapter in that process. However, in the end, he tells us his father was revered when he died. Maybe there will be a new book telling us how much he loved his father.I liked the first part of the book, when basketball was a major part of his life. I had felt that once also. But I don't remember all that anquish over losing. Incidently, his college coach was tough, unyielding, and unfair. Conroy's father met his match!In the prologue, Conroy describes his many bouts with madness and that he had crazy spells during every novel he wrote. Well, this novel is another one, written by a crazy man."
2,mediocre,"This book was mediocre at best. Self-serving at times, Introduced too many characters making it difficult to follow. Like most Conroy novels, reverts back to his abusive Father to try and liven story.I suspect he dramatized much of the story like Bissinger did in ""Friday Night Lights""After this and the convoluted ""Beach Music"", I doubt I'll read another Conroy novel."
2,Don't Bother,"Do not waste your time on this one. This over written, overly long book would have made a nice magazine article, but as a full-blown work it is much ado about nothing. There seems to be nothing here that sets this team apart from any other of the hundreds of teams every year at colleges all over the country. At the end of the book I did not care one bit about any of the players on the team including Conroy, whose insecurity and self-loathing throughout the book is almost unbearable. If you are looking for a ""year in the life"" basketball book, read ""A Season on the BrinKk"" by John Feinstein or ""The Breaks of the Game"" by David Halberstam. Both are far superior to this mess."
2,"I like basketball, but this was too much","This was my first Pat Conroy book, and the last. while I understand all of his books are memoirs of his abuse-riddled childhood, his endless, repetitive self-absorption eventually just wore me down. the first half of the book was engrossing, but the author gave enough signals how it was all to end. the second half was a real slog. boring! get over yourself, Conroy! I am so over you."
5,My losing Season,Pat Conroy's book My Losing Season Is about Pat in his early years trying to take his basketball team to the championship but he finds it hard. He has to determine whether or not his family is more important to him than basketball. He deals with his father's abuse and disapproval of what he is doing. This has been one of the best book that I have ever read. Anyone who likes basketball or has played any sport would love this book.
2,Interesting mainly to himself,"Pat Conroy sets out to digest his college basketball career but quickly develops a case of literary diarrhea. The Prologue is interesting and Part 1 sets the tone of his story but the rest of the book is overstated, melodramatic, repetitious, and occasionally unbelievable. Taking the book at face value, I conclude that Mr. Conroy was a better basketball player than he is a writer. His real talent is as a narcissist. If you want to sample this book, I'd recommend you get it from the library, read the Prologue and Chapters 1, 2, and 30, and return the book. The rest adds almost nothing."
4,LOVE Conroy!,"While I love Conroy's style of writing and lyrical descriptions, this book was too much about sports for my taste. OK, that's the point about the book, but it was extremely enjoyable despite the sports theme. The stories and conclusions about friends are excellent. I loved ""Beach Music"", ""The Great Santini"", ""The Water is Wide"", etc. and am eagerly awaiting the next Conroy book. I recommend to all, especially for sports lovers, but also for the non-sports people, too!"
4,old movie,"An old move and rather cheesy. Not the sellers fault, but it did not have much about the Grand Canyon which was why we bought."
5,A Hit!,"I purchased this book used for my 8 year old grandson, who is an avid reader. He just emailed to tell me how much he enjoyed the book. From my brief assessment, I would think this book would be ideal for the 8 - 11 year old."
5,I love this tea,"Not only has Kabucha kept me well for the passed two flu seasons everyday ,you have a little passage to read on each tea bag.I post them around my salon for the girls to read we all drink Kabucha and now I am sending a package to my sister in Texas!Drink up you'll love it!"
4,Fresh,Numskullz have been around for a while and have finally hit us with their album. They possess a unique sound with some dope beats. There is a cohesive vibe that jels this album together with beats that contain wonderful depth giving the MC Rola the oppurtunity to express himself eloquently. Rola is definitely a very underrated MC and Numskullz is an underrated group.
1,Limited Edition packing not worth extra bucks,"There is no reason to purchase the limited edition- the disc is the same, and the only thing you get for the extra money is a non-jewel case package. No extras at all. The album's great! But this edition is not worth it."
3,"Welcome release, but leaves listener wanting","On ""Come With Us"", ""It Began in Afrika"" is the strongest track followed by ""Star Guitar"", so it is no wonder that both of those tracks were treated to CD singles. The last third of the album I found dissapointing. The rest of the album of is definately worthy of at least one listen and demonstrates the interesting variety of approaches that the Chemical Brothers have shown in their past releases.If you are considering the purchase of the Limited Edition package of ""Come With Us"", don't. It contains no extra tracks. Instead, use that money to buy the standard version of ""Come With Us"" and any of the currently available CD singles from this album."
4,"Good music, bad buy","I too got suckered into the ltd edition packaging. I figured with the average selling price of 5-8 dollars more for the ltd edition packaging I was getting some bonus tracks or a bonus CD. Nope. .... I agree with everyone else..get the jewel case edition, it'd hold up better if you take it around places, it wont bend unlike the cardboard and the CD wont scratch up as easily as it will rubbing against that cardboard sleeve that the ltd edt packaging has. Is it ME or would this paper sleeve cost less to make than the jewel case?Guess they just knew people who always buy the limited release would get suckered into buying it. Guess they taught me one thing....never again will I buy anything limitted edition from the Chem. Bros....they can block rock MY beat..."
3,another great album with a horrible gimmick,"wow. putting behind their experimental side of 'surrender', tom and ed return with a powerhouse of a release. three tracks are already hits with the various crowds out there: it began in afrika, galaxy bounce, and star guitar. the rest of the tracks are a flurry of genres, from electrofunk to some idm-like beats to some dub/ambient. with guest appearances from beth orton and richard ashcroft, both tracks of which were solid, the album rounds out nicely. regretably, the tease of the idea of mixing all the song together between it began in afrika and galaxy bounce leave me with a wish to have seen them do it. and while it is a solid album, it is nothing extraordinarily new from the chems, just more of what one would expect. they also lose points for allowing astralwerks to release a 'limited edition' version of the cd."
1,Flaked and didn't hold up well.,"We bought this to use on our two year old. He has a double cow lick and we like his hair spiked. In our experience, this gel started off ok but well before the day is over it lost its hold. It also flaked throughout the day. The smell is not bad - it reminds me of salon smells. We used this gel for a few weeks before deciding on a replacement gelJohnny B. Mode Styling Gel Medium Hold 16oz. We found this new gel did hold well almost all day and rarely flakes.1/5 stars because it doesn't work well enough for the price."
4,WWE Cyber Sunday 2007 review,"The only bad match on the whole card was the Kane-M.V.P-U.S title match. The best matches were All 3 of the World title match & the Street-fight between HHH & Umaga. The Rey Mysterio-Finlay-Stretcher match was a high-flying,entertaining,brawling bout and the same goes for the Mr.Kennedy-Jeff Hardy match. I give this PPV a 8.8 out of 10."
2,The cover says it all....,"The cover of this DVD has WWE Diva Candice Michelle on it. This is an obvious sign that nothing spectacular or interesting is going to happen on this pay per view. I actually bought this DVD months back, watched it and can't tell you a thing about it. Because it is not interesting or entertaining."
2,Barely ok for the money,"Good enough for the money. You might get more from a college textbook, but you'll pay a hell of a lot more. My only caution: be careful on the digital editions. I got the Nook version (sorry, it was a gift, I'd rather have had it on Kindle), and and it looks like a crappy scan. There are a *lot* of errors and malformed characters. That's ok if you're already a pro, but if you're just some poor slob like me who's trying to teach himself physics, it doesn't take long to lose confidence in *any* of the answers you read.I hope that's not true for the Kindle version. A better alternative in the Schaum's series that I'd recommend over this one is the paperback ""Schaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Physics (Schaum's Outline Series)"" by Alvin Halpern, Ph. D.Update: 3/17/2012 I tried to give the book another shot, and instead came back to remove one of the stars. Horrible book. If this is the same guy, then it's all starting to make sense:[...]"
4,If You're in AP Physics & Need Some Review...,"This book is awesome. It contains a ton of word problems, perfect for AP Test Prep and HW!"
1,a little light,"This book is probably good for high school physics. I am in a physics for non-majors course in college and I found the material in the book to be not in-depth enough. To be honest I found it relatively useless to consult when I had a tough question and needed some help. There are better books out there. I just ordered 3 books that were recommended to me: ""The Physics Problem Solver"" by James Ogden, ""How To Solve Physics Problems and Make The Grade"" by Robert M. Oman and Daniel M. Oman and ""3,000 Solved Problems in Physics"" by Alvin Halpern.Don't bother with this book if you feel lost in physics because it won't really help you."
3,It's ok.,I used this book for a Physics class. It was alright. I wish it showed how to actually do the problem instead of just giving answers. There are a few different versions and they are all pretty much the same.
5,Gran Libro,"Este libro es recomendado para aquellas personas que tienen intereses en la criptografia pero que no poseen grandes conocimentos de teoría de números ni de álgebra. Casi todos los algoritmos tanto clásicos como los modernos están detallados en esta edición, por lo tanto lo recomiendo ampliamente."
5,"Finally, a Cryptology book for the illiterate masses","Very well done book. Bravo to the authors for using normal english and plenty of illustrations. The purpose of educational books should be to impart knowledge and facilitate understanding with little effort. This book does it well. Don't let the size of this book fool you. It has plenty of in-depth information. Before reading this book, I could never understand what MOD meant. Now, using my Windows Calculator, I am as good as the best Cryptologists. :^ )"
3,Pretty Darn Readable,"It explained the basic concepts of cryptography quite well but at times I found the story of ""Alice and Bob"" to be a bit tedious. Although written for the layperson, the book skims too rapidly over some very basic concepts (S-Box and Confusion for example). Too much of the book was dedicated to hacking-type breaches of security and not enough to cryptanalysis of DES and other systems. Still, overall a good book. The next edition should tighten it up a bit."
2,Disappointing and definitely not accessible,"The cover says this book can be understood by anyone with a basic math background and an interest in formulas. Don't believe it! By only the second chapter, the author assumes, without any real explanation, that you know what a euclidean field is and how continued fractions relate to matrices. The presentation strikes me as arrogant; there are far too many gaps to be filled in by the reader. Maybe I'm dumb, but I did somehow manage to stumble through MIT with 16 straight A's in my undergraduate math courses, and spent three years in graduate school studying number theory. The author should have taken more time to explain, and skipped a lot of the sideshows and self-promotion. If I could return this book I would. I give it a 3 only because the appendices are more fun than the main text."
2,Not for the faint-hearted,"Although the author comes over as arrogant, I am, after several years, warming to this book. With concentration and very careful reading I have found that much can be gained from it. It is humorous, witty and iconoclastic. Reading a page here and a paragraph there, I have learned what Mordell's theorem is, almost understood a single paragraph proof of the prime number theorem, and more maths besides.It is however heavy going and the lectures and notes are in a concentrated form. The cover says the book assumes only one year of university maths. I really doubt this is enough math for this book. So beware."
2,"Clonus - Just Rent ""The Island"" Instead.","I bought this movie, as I realized after watching The Island that it was a remake, and I wanted to see the orginial one more time. It took me some time to find the movie as I had almost forgotten the title which I had seen on TV way back when. So I bought it so that I could see the whole movie now that i am older. The movie was just fair, and is kind of corney of course. This has all the makings of a low-budget flick. The story is interesting, but not enough to warrant buying this DVD. Buy The Island instead, the effects and storyline are better. The makers of the Island did Clonus a favor by remaking it. It is a great storyline, but skip buying this one."
2,dumb clones,"Let's face it, clones are rock stupid and this movie proves it. A half-witted clone escapes from a facility that breeds and raises clones so their parts can be harvested if their counter part ever needs them. In a stroke of unbelievable coincidence he runs into the the man who he was cloned from who did not know he had been cloned. So this man tries to help his clone escape his equally micro-minded clone girlfriend who ends up getting a labotomy which doesn't do much to aid the situation. Well, it's all a rather stupid mess and the memories of it I've brought up thus far have made me ill enough. In short, about all this movie is good for is a few laughs but it is a terrible piece of work."
1,Do NOT do business with bargaincell!,"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned."
5,Best Book,this is one of the best books i have ever read and i am a book gobbler this book has a excellent plot and is very inresting just dont read it too often or else you will memorize it and it will lose all feeling
5,Nothing Like It!,"Between Us is a great way to say ""I Care."" Whether you give this video to someone diagnosed with breast cancer, or to a friend or relative of someone with breast cancer, it is an extremely informative gift of love. There is nothing like hearing it from someone who's ""been there."" The ladies in this film are real people and they share their experience with you in a helpful way. The video leaves you with a feeling of hope, and in some cases may be just the strength you need to get through this trying time. As a ""giver"" of the film, you get that feeling that you found just the right thing."
4,good little introduction,"A good little introduction to one of the all the time greats. Keeping Up With the Joneses is worth the price alone, it has great singing, style, & feeling along with sparse beautiful music, along with a couple of other gems."
1,"Weak at best, no effect on me","I was hoping this would offer some relief. There are many better natural remedies from others for much less cost that include Valerian and Melatonin. I would have to take 4-6 of these to have any effect compared to 1 of another brand whether it is Vitamin World or Vitamin Shoppe. Valerian is OK for a natural herb when it comes to helping one relax and melatonin is good for falling asleep, Clarocets problem is it lacks a sufficient amount of ingredients to do the job. The best solution for my sleep issues would be if the American government would take the Islamic threat on the USA and world more seriously, God knows the EU doesn't at all, but with Obama for the next three years I don't expect it to change."
4,Esoteric but Colorful,"I must respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer. For those interested in military knives, and/or the British Commandos, this book fills a niche. The author at length explains the setting for, and origin of, the development of what would become the famed Fairbairn/Sykes ""Commando"" dagger. In the colorful location of Shanghai, we find the characters who created the prototypes of the famed blade. It is only my desire for even more photos that precludes a five-star review. When one finds a book that offers information found hardly anywhere else, and which documents an exciting historical, albeit esoteric item, one must purchase it. It is a small booklet compared to the slick tomes put out by major publishers, but a gem nevertheless."
1,Did not like characters.,Did not like plot.did not think it plausible. Did not find the characters interesting or entertaining.It was a waste of good actors.
2,Would not purchase again,I own a number of British Series. Commander Set 1 and Set 2 along with An Unsuitable Job for a Woman are probably three of the less desirable to buy. I did not think that that women with such power could be so weak.
4,Lots of Batteries,This product shipped on time and was delivered as advertised. Good deal I I would do it again if and when I need more Batteries.
1,batteries got loose and shorted out,"Firstly, a good portion the batteries were bad from the outset. Since the batteries are not well packages, after a while they were seperated from their packaging and so I put them in a baggie, big mistake, they all shorted out and discharged. Probably lucky I didn't start a fire.Not recommendedScott"
2,False advertising,I'm very upset. Just received this DVD and was very surprised to find that it is not the DVD advertised. I bought it for Lavell Crawford and Cedric the Entertainer--neither of which are on the DVD.
3,Laff 5,"This laffapalooza 5 is not the dvd that is advertised, i purchased this dvd thinking it had Lavelle Crawford on it and he is not even on the dvd, i think the description of the dvds should be more accurate."
1,Impossible to repair,"I bought this from a department store, after 3 weeks the hight adjustment quit working. Called the 800 number, was told to take it to a repair shop that was just under 4 hours away, apparently that was the only authorized dealer. I took it back to the department store and received a full refund. If you buy this, make sure the authorized repair dealer is close by."
1,Do not buy this product,"Vacuum is way too heavy.Works reasonably well but button/etc are a bit flimsy and don't seem to respond well.Retractable power cord broke the 3rd day I used it.I would never buy this machine again. Also, for the most part, I recommend a cannister over the upright."
2,faulty wheel design,"I purchased the oxy 3 in January 2006. Within a few months, the wheel broke off and I took it to the nearest service shop for repair. The repairman stated that this problem was very common and that he had replaced several wheels. Several months later, the new wheel broke off again, so I took it back for an additional repair. The opposite wheel has now broken off, so I will likely find a new vacuum to purchase.The product does clean carpet and hardwood well and it is very quiet, but it's obviously impractical to use with only one wheel! Additionally, finding bags and filters locally for the vacuum is impossible...I have to purchase on-line."
1,Get something else,"We bought this in Nov. of '06, and the housing for the brush melted in August of '07. The company is providing a free replacement, but when I asked the repairman why this happened, he said, ""It's just not a good vacuum cleaner."" So much for the Electrolux brand name. By the way, we only used this about 10 times before it crapped out."
1,poor quality,"Beware--This is NOT the Real Electrolux (which is made by Aerus). I purchased this believing it to be a replacement for the Electrolux I'd owned for 20 years. The wheel broke off and flew across the room after being lightly used for 7 months. When I took it to the repair shop, the gentleman told me it was the 2nd one he'd received that week with the wheel that had broken off. It is HEAVY, maneuvers poorly and is frankly a poorly designed machine that is grossly overpriced. I found out that the vacuum cleaner I'd purchased is actually a Eureka--the Eureka company had purchased"" the Electrolux brand name--but it is NOT the real Electrolux. I found an Aerus dealer who sold the REAL Electrolux and purchased one. The big orange monster is with the repairman."
2,Poor quality design,"I'm on my second Oxygen upright. The wheel broke off the first on after 3 months of use. Returned it to the dealer and got a new one in exchange. After 6 months, same problem. Could not return this one due to the time from original purchase. Called my nearest authorized service center (1 1/2 hours away) as it was still under the Electrolux 1 year warranty. He said that this is common with this model and in fact said this will happen with ""all of them"". As stated above, this is acutally made by Eureka and, while is cleans very well and is very quiet, it is not worth wasting your time and money on."
1,rip off vac,"The wheel broke off of my vac right after the one year warranty was up. I took it to the repair shop. A month later they called and said it would be about $200 to repair it. Another month went by and they called and said Electrolux has been having this problem with these vacs and they will replace it. Six months went by and the repair shop called and said Electrolux would only replace it with a different model. I agreed and the thing they sent me is horrible. It is a commercial vacuum cleaner. Heavy, hard to handle, the cord is so heavy I can hardly lift it and it doesn't retract. Is is also ugly. I am so angry with this company I would never buy another one of their products. I am now looking for a new vacuum cleaner, and it won't be an Electrolux! I am also trying to give this monster away that they sent as a replacement. So far, no takers."
2,Broken wheel,"Like others have pointed out, my wheel has broken off as well after less than a year of use. The lock that keeps it upright broke off about 3 months ago. I sure wish I would've read these reviews before I made my purchase. DO NOT buy this product unless you like burning money. They did get the motor right as it does vacuum well but the rest of it is falling apart."
1,So Bad!,"I bought this vacuum because of it's name but, sadly, this Electrolux is a hugh disappointment. The electronic height adjuster is stuck on the high settings (after only 6 month) so I can not vacuum my carpets. The manufacturer replaced it twice and after the third break would not help me. I tried to repair it on my own but they were no longer making the parts that were needed. The vacuum was not even 4 years old. It is pretty sad to own a vacuum that you can not use as a vacuum. I wish I had seen these reviews before I spent the $600.00."
5,HILARIOUS,This show is hilarious. I have watched every single one over and over and over again & still find funny things I didn't catch the first time. You also learn a lot.
3,Great video series,Great video series. One of the discs in my set does lockup however and has to be fast forwarded through to keep playing the disc.
1,Bad service,"The movies arrived on time, but upon opening them we could tell they were not a very good quality. Sure enough the first disc would not play a couple of episodes. We checked every disc and they got progressively worse as the seasons went on so that by the last season we had the disc would not even work at all. Needless to say we contacted the seller who did not respond, so we had to get Amazon involved. Thankfully with Amazons help we got a refund and were able to buy the movies from a decent seller, whose stuff actually works."
5,enough is not enough,"I have not yet bought these dvds the reason they come on every night I'm thinking tbs I record them but can only keep five at one time. The price has come down from a hundred and some to eighty, I am seventy and watched many a show that were funny in the day but nothing like this. I love when Penny and Sheldon are together by themself talking the looks on Penny face is priceless, no matter what she gets the best of him."
2,the big bang theory seasons 1-4,"the shows is ok but the packaging is sub par at best. disk will not stay put and the case won""t stay closed. This is the cheapest cases I've seen."
2,Well...what I got was great,"Received the DVDs on time and they all work. BUT, I received two season 2 sets and no season 3! Really disappointing because when I figured it out I was wanting to start season 3 and had friends over!"
3,there are one disc from season 3 and 2 discs from season 4 won't play.,It was ok. It took almost two weeks for me to get them. it is new and looks alright.only reason I only gave 3 starts is because there are 3 discs won't play. and that really makes me sad. I don't know if I still can ask for change or anything since I already opened them.
3,Disc skips,Love the big bang theory. Ordered package seasons 1-4. DVD package was new and I'm sure its no fault of the supplier but season two disc two skips and you can not view the full episode
1,Pirated?,"I purchased the set as a gift for my daughter. She received it, was thrilled to get it and then popped it into her mac. Unlike every other dvd she has ever put in her mac, this one wouldn't play and she had to do a work around to get it to play. When it did play, there was no menu structure as there would be with a normal dvd. She would have to click on a file, each file is one and a half episodes, no way of knowing which episode. And it was in Portugese. Every time she puts it in to watch it, she has to change the language. She is certain it's pirated. I'm certain I'll never buy from that ""store"" again."
1,Terrible set - bootlegged??,I've had to replace most of this set due to bad DVDs which are completely unwatchable - more than one too. I've replaced season 2 and now I'm going to replace season 3. It was too late to return the product. I would recommend buying the show in single DVDs. The only thing I can figure is that this set must be bootlegged.
1,"Come on, really?","I was really excited when the package came earlier than expected, and it was all bundled together like this. HOWEVER, about 90% of the discs are scratched, and two of the boxes were broken. Not to mention the fact that Season 2 and 3 were both missing a disc altogether. For something advertised as new, it definitely isn't, and for this price it should be. This is unacceptable and I will be reporting it."
4,Pretty Good.,"Received the package very quickly. Only one disc out of the whole set had a scratch on them, so pretty good."
1,Missing shows,Season 3 only has half the shows it's suppose to have. The guide lists 8 episodes per disc but each disc only has 4.
5,Awesome,My fiancee and I loved how fast this came in. Also how everything was wrapped up and looked great when we got it.
5,Great show,I recently started watching reruns of this show on TV & quickly got hooked so I bought this season 4 pk. The characters are so great & there is a real chemistry within the cast that makes this very funny show well worth watching. I love the idea of skinny packaging so you can get an entire season in 1 slim case. It's a real space saver.
5,AWESOME,"Best comedy for a long time , have watched all 4 seasons twice. Amazon service was great. If you want a good laugh I reccomend , Sheldon Rules"
1,Bundle price should be less,"The bundle price is $134.99 on sale. Buying them individually would cost $107.67. It doesn't add up. When bundling things together, they should give a discount for buying the bundle, but it should NEVER cost more for a bundle."
1,WAY overpriced...,"Sears has this boxed set for $69, and other sellers have it listed for under $100.00. This price is ridiculous."
3,"Love the show, but the quality of the product is low","I ordered seasons 1-4 for my husband for his birthday. We LOVE LOVE LOVE the show, but the quality of the DVD's that we received were not good at all. The picture is very grainy (poor quality reproduction) on my LED flat screen.I wish I could give it 5 stars, as this is the first time I've purchased DVD's from Amazon that were not of the best quality. My past purchases have been top notch.I think Amazon should check out some of it's suppliers and their products prior to allowing them to sell. They say you get what you pay for. I paid over $100 for the 4-season set. It should have been of better quality.I also pre-ordered season 5 at the same time. I hope it's of better quality than seasons 1-4."
