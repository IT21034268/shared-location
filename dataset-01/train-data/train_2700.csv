5,Amazing,"This is an amazing session. Recorded in 1959 in Paris. Oscar Peterson, Ray Brown, and Ed Thigpen with Sonny Stitt - talk about a line up..."
1,Generic filter..ugh,We ordered these filters without reading the reviews. Generic filters that came from Lillian Vernon. They had wire around the outside instead of the soft mesh that is usually on the Honeywell HAC504. The price is too high for something so cheaply made. Never again will we purchase these. Save your money and look elsewhere.
1,never again,"Is there anywhere to buy the old filters without the blue wrapping.I have used Honeywell Humidifiers for many years and never had the smell / mold problem you do with these filters, they are downright unhealthy.I tried to rate these zero stars they are that bad but the system would not let me.Please go back to the old filters"
2,**** NOT HONEYWELL ****,"FALSE ADVERTISING. THIS IS NOT A HONEYWELL BRAND PRODUCT. This product **does** look like the photo however... it is the filter alone, without any metal or plastic around it to help support the filter once it gets wet. It DOES work but it will fall down after a few days. It is NOT made by HONEYWELL, nor does it say ANYWHERE on this webpage that it is not Honeywell. IF YOU WANT ACTUAL HONEYWELL PRODUCT, SEARCH AMAZON.COM FOR: Honeywell HAC-504AW Humidifier Wick Filter, Single"
1,Would not order from this company again.,"The order I placed is not what I received. They were the wrong size and unusable, but would cost to much to return to company. I would not recommend that you order thru them. The order form had the # of the ones I ordered but not what I received."
3,Filter looks different in box than picture shown,"The filter shown is not the filter I received, although honeywell explained to me that the HAC504A was an acceptable alternative. I would warn against purchasing this b/c I was told they often ship filter substitutions without having to notify the buyer."
5,Humidifier Filters!,The BEST filters I ever used. I am breathing better and I can walk further than ever before! Thank you.
2,How to compromise with a bad idea,"Evaporative humidifiers are flawed conceptually for several reasons: they are noisy, high velocity air to create enough humidity to be worthwhile is uncomfortable, wet evaporator filter breeds molds etc. You have to keep buying filters and chemicals to keep it clean which are evaporated into the air. Other types are more expensive so sometimes you have to compromise."
2,new filter gets moldy quickly,"Purchased the filter to replace my old moldy filter. Had this one a few months, and within 6 weeks or so, I started to see black spots. Can't remember whether the first filter was began to mold that early. Relative to other humidifiers that I have previously owned, this one requires constant maintenance. And, to have a ~$15 filter mold within such a short time, well, when this filter goes, I'll be purchasing a different unit altogether."
1,honeywell HAC504 filter,"Filter does not fit the humidifier. It is too high and not the same size as the original, which does not allow for closing of the cover. I will attempt to return this item."
2,"Works well, for a few days",The filters work great when they work at all. The filter shown in the picture is the old style which worked better than the new style which has a blue wrap around the filter to help prevent mold.The problem is that after a few days they stop wicking gradually and eventually dry out even when remoistened.Mold does build up occasionally but honestly they don't last long enough for that to be a serious problem.
2,Not the best,The humidifier is not great. Every time we fill it it leaks on the floor from the valve until you get it in. The filters are supposed to last for 1-3 months and our starts to smell musty in 2-4 weeks.
4,Does what it is supposed to,"Shipped quickly, product in good condition and as described on the site, fits in my humidifier. I didn't have any problems with receiving a generic version - this filter was in the branded Honeywell packaging.One star off because these ones seem to need replacing more frequently than the slightly more expensive antibacterial ones with the blue layer."
1,No more shopping from Allergy Be Gone,"The filters I received were BestAir HW500 (1 of 4 was in the original box). They have a metal shell versus plastic on the original Honeywell HAC504. I returned them and received another set of filters which were again the same filters(HW500) I believe. They had no original box and the shell was metal, which can easily scratch its housing and stimulate mold growth in humidifier.It is also sad that I saw another review sent on October 2007 about similar problem(purchased as HAC504, received different) for the same item purchased from Allergy Be Gone."
1,do not buy it! VERY CHEAP AND UNHEALTHY!,"Length:: 0:35 MinsI was ordering filter which pictured on this page on amazon.com site, but I've got different type of filter. but I decided to give it a try. in this video you can see what happened to that so CHEAPLY made filter just after 2!!! days of use!!! If you get same filter I did, DO NOT KEEP IT! RETURN right away! it's just SIMPLY DANGEROUS to use!the original filter from Honewell (which pictured on this page) is very good! I used it many times before I needed to replace it!"
1,Junk,"It came with a strange metal wrap which was very sticky and when I tried to remove the wrap, the filter tore apart. Material used in the filter is like paper and durability is questionable. Never buy."
2,Not a good-quality filter -- metal frame rusted right away,"This item is not of the same quality as what I have ordered in the past, which is a better product -- Honeywell HAC-504AW Humidifier Wick Filter, Single Sold by: Amazon.com LLC. This one from Today's Concept shipped in a plastic bag and was kinda smushed flat when it arrived. The filter itself has a metal mesh frame to it, which rusted and discolored the filter (and put what into the air I don't know) material within just a couple days, even though every morning I take the filter out of the water to air-dry. I used it only a few days (supposed to be able to keep them for 30 days) before it looked too scary, and I just threw it out."
4,Do the job,"I have two Honeywell humidifiers. If you don't use them for more than 3 days, mold buildup occurred. I have to replace the filter frequently. Order two packs from Amazon and received the items promptly. Ready for next summer"
3,Don't last too long...,"We are pretty happy with the humidifier, but the filters get dirty fairly quickly (alot quicker than other humidifier filters we have used) and as pricey as they are, to have to change them this often is really costly. This is the least expensive I have found them though, at Home Depot, where we got the humidifier, they are $20 a filter."
4,except doesn't last long,"I love the filter because it doesn't fall apart in my hands when I try to form to a circular shape. Works well except for one problem. Just like any other filter, it doesn't last long. That has a lot to do with the water quality in my area, I know."
4,Honeywell HAC504 Replacement Humidifier Filter,"Great price - even honored later date sale price but lacked outer evaporative ""cloth"" covering of original."
2,Anti-microbial feature is false.,Item states an anti-microbial feature. However mold buildup ocurred in about 2 weeks. Thus have to replace every 2 weeks instead of the manufactured recommended of 2-3 months. This 2 week replacement frequency has been consistent for the last 2 months for me. Will look into getting another humidifier that is not made by Honeywell.
2,a poor design,i am very disappointed with this humidifier and its filter. it consumes about 1 filter per month and if you keep the humidifier off for more than 2 days the filter dries up and you might as well throw it away.
4,An interesting collection of short stories,"This is a very interesting piece of fiction. The stories in The First Paper Girl In Red Oak, Iowa are quirky, poignant, intelligent and funny. What amazes me most is the character development in the short stories. Stuckey-French is able to create wonderful and life-like characters in a brief story. My favorites are ""Junior,"" ""The First Paper Girl In Red Oak, Iowa,"" ""Famous Poets,"" and ""Blessings."" Each story has its own brand of quirkiness and hidden message. Also, I love the backdrop of the Midwest. I have never been there -- I've always been an East Coast girl -- but the vivid descriptions made me feel as though it was my own hometown. This is a great book. I highly recommend it, especially to Midwesterners."
3,Strange. Very Strange.,"My former father-in-law is from Red Oak, Iowa. I got this book, thinking he might like it. I did not pass it on.What we have here is another Literature, Fine Arts Major writing to impress herself and her associates. It's a collection of artsy stories: offbeat, sometimes insightful, Not Necessarily Iowa based. It's urban Des Moines more than Red Oak sensibilites. If you liked Haruf's Plainsong, this collection's for you!Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
5,She is at her top,"during this concert Mariah was at the top of her voice, carreer ...each performance of this show is simply unique and perfect!!"
1,what the...,this is awful music...it reminds me of my kids recital..when EVERYONE..is testing out their instrument...at the same time...im a pretty open person...but theres no room for this..not on my shelf...if you like jazz...smooth jazz..check out Norman Brown..Albright...Streetwise...something...anything...just not this....but of course..this is just my opinion..and who really cares........
5,with I had two pair,I love these sandals. Once broken in they are by far the most comfortable shoes I own.
2,Garden Party reality check!,"As an old disc jockey who once interviewed Rick and Dion in the early 70's , here's the real story on Rick's Garden Party ordeal:The night of the show in New York while he and the Stone Canyon Band were on stage , there was a disturbance in the section of seats just above where the guys were playing. When the hassle broke out , the security people went up to escort the offenders out of the Madison Square Garden show. At just the moment Rick was playing Honkey Tonk Woman , the ""bad guys"" were being escorted outside and the surrounding crowd started to ""boo"" the cops. At first ,Rick thought they were booing him , but the ""hisses"" were for the security people.That's the truth. Sorry it doesn't match urban legend.All that being said , I'll still enjoy any of Rick's greatest hits. Always have..always will.David - Elk Grove ,Ca."
4,"If Rick can't please anyone, you have to please yourself","O.k. Not all of the song, with the exception of Garden Party, are nearly popular of Rick's early and rock-abily hits such as Hello Mary Lou and Traveling Man. In fact, he was booed from the stage by fans in Madison Square Garden when he tried to play his new song... Rick wrote Garden Party as the reflection of that incident.. He made points in Garden Party.. First, he didn't want to be part of rock&roll nostalgia. Second, he wanted to put forth his country. Third, he didn't want to please anyone by playing old tunes.. If you think that Rick can't please anyone, you have to please yourself.."
1,Best of Rick Nelson,"I have reviewed all the ""Best"" or Greatest albums of Rick Nelson and do not care for any of the collection of tunes in any CD. The CDs are not of remastered originals but made from a time period later in his career when his voice and style changed."
5,Perfect,This is simply a great stats book. It takes complex models such as logistic regression and multivariate analysis and explains them in real life simple examples. I feel that I finally have a grasp on medical statistics and how and when to use these test.
1,Not good quality,"I loved the way Staub cooks, or at least until my pot cracked against the sink. Amazingly the sink survived but my pot has a crack 4 inches long. I was more amazed to see a disclaimer on their website that if the pot hits a solid surface it might break and there is no warranty on that. I have plenty of Le Creuset and they resist pretty much everything. Staub slipped of my hand and cracked againt the sink. Poor quality and they never answer phone calls or e-mails for warranty services. Also, keep your reciept forever because you need it for any claims. To pay $200-$300 for a pot and loose it like that is not worth it. Go with Le Creuset instead."
5,Cooks as well as it looks,"I really like the looks of this dutch oven. Like another reviewer, a lot of my purchasing decision was based on the rooster handle. Who else makes funny-shaped handles like animals?! I've got a cookware addition by the way.The other reason why I purchased this is that Staub seemed higher in quality than my Le Creseut. Also, I purchased this Staub so I could use both when cooking for many people. After using it for a few weeks, I find the meat seemed a tad moister in the Staub. And when baking no-knead bread, the Staub seemed crisper on the outside. No stress because both brands will give excellent results."
2,Is not useful for improve your game,"This book is only a curiosity, maybe a mathematic who likes bridge can enjoy it but not the bridge players who want improve their score since they can not use the calculator machine in the table.....i dont recommend it"
4,Photo paper,I don't like this product quite as much as the Ilford gallerie Paper that I used before. (professional inkjet photo range) but it is good. Don't know if it will lose color over the years but presume it won't Tried it because other paper is no longer available.
2,Carry Me Home DVD,"I didn't care for this movie. I disagreed with the story, the outcome and the values portrayed in the movie. I thought it would be different but was sadly disappointed."
1,Do not purchase! Waste of your money!,"These videos are very poorly done. I tried to return for a refund but they do not do refunds. Therefore, I am leaving this review to protect everyone else. The Stations do not even go through the Primary assessment. He says BSI Scene Safe then starts in with treatment. There are only 4 or 5 that actually show you what you are supposed to do. The emt in the videos is unsure of what to do and hesitates and repeats himself. There is only one trauma scenario that covers everything and 4 Medical Scenarios. There are several times he even skips portions of the Primary Survey.Find another product.Ron"
5,The Natural Inferiority of Women,"This book is, by title alone, the natural sequel to The Natural Superiority of Women by Montagu, an early feminist manifesto. It was, therefore, a 'must buy' for a guy who grew up in a household of early feminists who kept a copy of the Natural Superiority on the coffee table (for at least a decade). The overly serious nature of the former practically demanded the assembly of these incredibly entertaining quotations in the latter, collected by a woman for just that purpose. Risk taker that I am, I brought it out the first night that I met my girlfriend's relatives. It was a great icebreaker and a source of howling laughter. Only the humorless will find fault."
1,DOES NOT WORK for HP printers,"I bought this paper because it said it was compatible with HP inkjet printers. IT'S NOT! The black ink never dries to the paper and smears everywhere. I emailed the company about this problem and this is the response I got:""We believe to know the reason although we don't own a 1610 printer to prove.Your printer has dye based Vivera inks for Cyan, Magenta and Yellow and pigmented ink for Black. Our inkjet media you have is still the previous version of the Smooth Pearl Product which didn't perform well with the Vivera pigmented inks (in your case the Black). We launched this summer a new improved Smooth Pearl Paper that is now also compatible to the Vivera pigmented inks. Thus we propose that you switch to the new version IGSPP11.""They didn't even give me a coupon for the new paper...I doubt it even works. WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,FOR COMPLETIST'S ONLY: OLD AUDIO,"This set will indeed take you back in time, but, unfortunately, not due to the music: It sounds like it's coming out of an AM radio, as it was released fifteen years ago, and has never been remastered.If you are seeking the best reproduction of the TM&P;'s sound, serious consideration should be given to the remastered, 2001 2-disc setAll the Leaves Are Brown: The Golden Era Collection.""Era"" contains the complete first four TM&P;'s LP's, plus the non-LP single, ""Glad To Be Unhappy"" in excellent remastered sound. ""Era"" is also superior in sound to the MCA ""Greatest Hits"" single disc CD released in 1998.This disc should only be purchased if the more obscure tracks and studio dialog justifies the expense of this additional set."
5,An Overlooked Icon from the Musical Sixties,"All that I expected to hear was there, and it brings back some fond memories. But much more than that, the music was excellent! It is heard to advantage here in one of the most beautifully mastered CDs I have ever heard. Nice context is provided by the inclusion of music both pre-M&Ps and after the group's break-up. What is great about this compilation is that you don't have to be familiar with the group to appreciate their talent. Some of the masterpieces here have more than simply held up. 35 years later the music sounds as if it had been created today.The liner notes are fascinating, too..."
1,A tribute to paige and Banyan,"If you want to hear paige kiss up to TLC and Banyan, this is for you! Paige will absolutely gush about herself and how cute and sexy she is! The entries jump from one topic to the next without any explanation which makes it difficult to follow. I had to repeatedly look up which episode she was referring to on the computer. This gives NO insight into the behind the scenes. I wish that I never bought this book, waste of money!!!"
1,Only a page or two worth reading...,"I love the show ""Trading Spaces"" but I was very disappointed by Paige's book. I should have viewed a few pages prior to purchasing it, because I lost interest quickly and found it very superficial. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Paige thinks she is great,"I really love trading places and I was very excited to read about what goes on behind the set. This book is all about Paige talking about how great she is. There are full page descriptions about her great hotel rooms, about how she goes back to people that were on the show to cash in on airplane rides and basketball tickets. I guess the moral is if you have access to anything Paige might want - don't tell her or she will be knocking on your door. I like the show and Paige, but Paige likes herself enough for everyone."
2,Looks like it's for teens,With pictures and in diary structure. This book seems like it's made for teens about their favorite star. It doesnt look like it's about a 'star' of an adult show.
1,Paige by Paige hopeless drivel,"This book offered no insight into Trading Spaces. It is an egotistial diary written by the obviously mindless Paige Davis. If you want to know how wonderful Paige thinks she is, or how cute, what she wears when and where, then buy it. If you want the insider scoop on Trading Spaces, this book offers nothing! Its hopeless drivel and a huge waste of my money. It reads like a 12 year old's diary."
4,Paige by Paige - A Year of Trading Spaces,"My wife and I started watching Trading Places after discovering TLC to be a younger and hipper version of HGTV, which we still do like to watch Saturday nights. We had actually watched ""What Not to Wear"" and thought a channel with shows as way out as this might be worth watching. But then I saw her, the hostess of ""Trading Places,"" Paige Davis: the lithe long arms, dazzling smile mellowed by the shadow of a fleeting bemusement, the upward curl of the lips. And I knew I had seen a star, and wanted to know more. A web search confirmed what I had previously only intuited: Her star is fast rising. And a mighty wave is building build around her. Now is the time to ride that wave!"
4,"Not much Trading Spaces info, but good for Paige fans","I really enjoyed this and wish it had been longer. It's done in diary/journal format. There isn't as much behind-the-scenes info, and sometimes there isn't much about the episodes at all. However, the book gives a lot of insight into Paige, both from what she writes and the way she writes. There are a few people who have written reviews complaining about how it's all about Paige or it's egotistical, etc., and my response is ""duh."" It's written as a diary, and most people who keep diaries are writing mainly about themselves; that's the point. If you want to learn more about Trading Spaces, then this book isn't very helpful, but it does give some info, and if you're a fan of Paige, I'd say go for it. I only wish she'd written more."
1,Not Sterling Silver,"My husband gave me this bracelet and, after one day's wear, it turned my wrist green. So he used a magnifying glass but couldn't find the Sterling mark. Although he did find that one of the wings was slightly broken. Beautiful bracelet, but not sterling silver. And trying to return the bracelet is turning into a nightmare of hassles."
5,I love this bracelet,I am really pleased with this purchase. I love the beautiful detail of this piece. I have been wearing it a lot since I received it and have gotten great comments about it. It is very comfortable to wear.
5,Great Sticks,"These sticks are very good sticks. They are a nice balane between rock and jazz sticks, not to light not to heavy. The tips are very durable so they rarely break. There's good grip to them as well. Great all around sticks that will last long too."
5,Piano played as drums,I have met accomplished pianists who after hearing this album gave up playing the piano entirely and became monks.
1,rip-off - break a single book into multiple and earn more,As somebody else noted - this is the same Sword of Shannara broken down into a number of parts and sold separately presumably to fool people into spending more.The story is good and I would not hesitate recommending it to any fantasy fan but I'd rather have them read the original single book.
1,Class Time!,"Instead of writing a typical review like I normally do, I will instead attempt to educate you, internet user who picked to worst review to read (I'm not kidding, read the others) on what makes a person gullible. Ready? Good. Okay, late 70's Sword of Shannara first published and it sells. Dude writes sequals, they sell, and so on. As I write this Amozon sells this book new for $7.99 or used for as low as a penny. But his review isn't about Sword of Shannara, it's about Sword of Shannara : In the Shadow of the Warlock Lord aka what happens if a six year old manages to rip a book in thirds. This sells for $6.99, as do the second and third, which makes the grand total $20.97 a difference of $12.98, as compared to buying the actual book. QUIZ TIME! finish this famous quote, ""a fool and his money are ... """
2,Don't Bother,"The Paranoia Sourcebook is set in post-crash Alpha Complex, during the reboot period. Alpha Complex has split up into three factions - the Alpha Complex we know and love ruled by the benevolent computer, Alpha City ruled by renegade High Programmers, and Alpha Base ruled by secret societies gone public (see Crash Course Manual). The entire book is geared toward campaigning in this setting, and tells you exactly how to keep characters alive long enough for a campaign. Can anybody see what is wrong with this picture? The essence of Paranoia has been lost with this book, and it is easy to see why it was one of the last books of the line."
1,There's a better version available!,"Be advised, there are two versions of this video available, and this is not the one to buy. Paramount released this under the assumption that the only extant print of the original pilot was in black and white, and they combined it with the color footage used in The Menagerie. A few years later, a color print surfaced and was released. For some reason, Paramount continues to market them both. Amazon has the full-color version available, its ASIN is B000003K1B. Also, the black and white/color version is Volume 1 of the original video series; and the full color is Volume 99. So to get the most out of the amazing dancing green babe, buy the color one!"
5,Incredible un-released pilot,"I Hve seen this video, the un-released pilot of Star Trek because the TV executives thought it would be too dificult to understand, and I think it's probably the first Star Trek pilot, and I hve seen all the rest. I think that every one that call himself trekkie must see that video. Just one warning, there is not Kirk, not McCoy, anly Spock, and he is not liko our beloved Vulcan."
4,"Better than the first release, but still isn't perfect!","I was glad when Paramount found the lost color footage (I always thought they should've released Episode 1 strictly in B&W,) but now: Would someone please find the original soundtrack and restore that too? If you don't know what I'm referring to, listen to Meg Wylie's (The Keeper's) voice during the restored footage. It's in a lower register. It's obvious that her voice part was re-recorded for ""The Menagerie,"" so it would fit in with the new footage especially shot for it."
5,A real illusion...,"I could not recommend this episode enough for deep mental philosophical discussions. From this episode I was awaken to the fact that we all come from ideas, which in effect are illusions. This episode must be watched without in complete silence, in order to understand the depth of its theory."
1,This is NOT the color version!,"This was a good episode, but amazon is selling this as Episode 99 (the color version). It is not! It's Episode 1 (the black & white version). If I were you, I'd buy the DVD release instead. At least with that one you get both versions."
4,Good episode that should've been aired,"I saw ""The Cage"" episode in all-color on the Sci-Fi Channel a few weeks ago and it was good. A different crew of the Enterprise are in the show instead of Shatner, Nimoy, and the others. Some aliens with brains 4 times bigger than a human's, do some experiments on Captain Pike to find out more about the human species. Captain Pike sees what he imagines and has to fight off his own thoughts to find out what is real and what isn't. All the while, the aliens are doing experiments to test him and to see if they will keep him or let him go.""The Cage"" is a good episode. I don't see why it never aired on regular television. It has good effects and a good storyline. However, I do prefer the episodes with Shatner, Nimoy, Kelley, and the rest of the crew. But if you haven't ever seen ""The Cage,"" I recommend getting this episode. It would be a good addition to your Star Trek collection."
3,This epsiode gets a B- grade and is ranked 41st out of 80,"Ten years before James T. Kirk takes command of the U.S.S. Enterprise, Captain Christopher Pike and his starship crew receive a distress signal from the planet Talos IV and beam down to investigate. Tracking the beacon, the landing party discovers crash survivors from a missing scientific expedition; among the survivors is a beautiful human female, Vina. Pike is concerned for the woman's safety, yet allows himself to become distracted by her beauty and is subsequently captured by the Talosians who live beneath the planet's surface. The distress signal and expedition survivors, except for Vina, are revealed to be but illusions created by the Talosians to lure the Enterprise and Pike to the planet. The Talosians are a strong race, yet after decades of illusory indulgence, they have physically atrophied and need sturdy beings to rebuild and repopulate their barren planet."
2,not as expected,"This pasta fell apart, while the filling was still dry. There is also almost no cheese in these. I was very disappointed overall."
4,GOOD SHOW,"Live at The Paris Olympia with Lee Morgan and Benny Golson a week before the Club Saint Germain feast. Indeed some tunes would be repeated there. Highlights here are the only Messenger recording of Golson's Just By Myself, a 10 min. stretch out of Are You Real, and the Morgan feature-I Remember Clifford."
3,Good Book !!![.],From the looks of the cover I thought this book would be an awesome read but it fell a little bit short. From reading the back you would be sure that this book would be filled with drama to make you jaw drop but that was not the case. The story is of two best friends that goes through drama with their family and their boyfriends. I must admit I still do not see the reason for the title! I have read so many good books that I am not sure I can add this to the top of my list.
4,"""A Black Star is Born""","This book is definately a ""must Read"". Lewis captures so many facets of day to day situations involving love and life. From the time it took me to read the book from start to finish, I was totally entertained. Lewis in my opinion is definately an author on the road to writing success. Watch out Terry Mcmillian...here comes Natosha Gale-Lewis!"
4,Great A side and Awesome B sides,"Firstly this is Pt 1 single, not part 2 as the title suggests!Awesome single, the title track is one of the best off lost souls and 2 of the better b sides. Valley is a terrific song with a catchy piano and bass line. Down to sea is a very stripped back sea song, beautiful sounding with an ethereal sound to it.Worth buying or getting lost sides to have the songs."
3,Booda Muttz-RRR-Ella Sticks,"Good product, delivered quickly but not a good value for the price since there were only about 6 small sticks."
2,Choke-able!,"This are pretty choke-able. I got two of these as a sample with one of my dog toy orders and both times I saw them disappear into my dogs mouth while she chewed them. This made me very nervous because my dog loves to swallow things whole. She didn't, thankfully, but did end up swallowing them in large pieces which in itself isn't good because these are so tough, it's kind of like swallowing chunks of wood. Not to mention, they gave her the worst breath ever (and she already had bad breath!) Despite the $5.00 off coupon I received, I shall not be buying these."
2,Disappointing . . .,"I guess if I didn't actually own ferrets I would have enjoyed this book more. Ferrets are probably the most misunderstood domestic animal around and suggesting that a 2lb ferret (albet 4 of them)could kill a grown man and eat his face off is just plain absurd, and does not help the image of these wonderful animals. I know about literary license but pleeese! If you're going to write a book with an animal as the prime suspect the least you can do is a little research. Okay, I admit that I was expecting too much from a paperback mystery, but it would have been nice if she explored the ferrets personalites a little more. I mean, if it was called Nothing to Fear But Bunnies I would expect some insight on bunnies! As for as the rest of the book . . . I liked Kendra's character but I had a hard time getting past the ridiculous ferret face-eating plot and the whole story seemed to drag."
2,Very disappointing,"I know California is a nutty place, but a belief that 4 small ferrets could actually kill a large man?Nobody is that stupid. Also, while ferrets make noises...chirp, hiss, doink, and snore...they are not loudenough to be heard outside a door. They are very quiet creatures. Most ferrets would not recognize fresh meat asfood. They may gobble ferret/kitten/cat chow, dog biscuits, peanut butter, bananas, strawberry jam, and baklava,I have not known them to eat regular meat. Cooked or canned. In fact fruits and veggies are the usual training treats!This could have been such a good book with a little bit of research, and an awareness that people value their ferrets asmuch as she values her dog."
4,NOTHING TO FFEAR BUT FERRETS,Enjoyable read and I will purchase more of her books. Right now I am hooked on PD James. It is not fair to compare.
4,Great recovery,Glutaform by primaforce is a great product. It works as advertised for the most part- or at least in the recovery department. I used 1 scoop (5 g. glutamine) in my protein shake after each workout and the next day I didn't feel very sore at all. I also used 1 scoop before bed. It didn't do so much for creating muscle fullness or volume but if you're looking for something to boost recovery then buy this and use it in your protein shakes (even though they already contain glutamine) and you shouldn't feel much soreness the next day.
3,Missing Book Description,"Setting: American WestA Taste of Heaven...When beautiful Katie Lee Holden lost everything, masterful Bruce Cabot came to her rescue. But Katie Lee was determined to forge her destiny alone-and light up the stage of glittering turn-of-the-century Seattle. No one would stop her...not even the man she loved.To Bruce, Katie Lee was a pure and brilliant diamond. He vowed to make her his wife-before her sparkle was tarnished by unscrupulous men.They shared the embrace of eternal desire. But would they ever share one another's dreams?"
2,Lasted a couple years,I have one. It burned out yesterday. I assume the fuse blew. I had it a couple years and used it rarely. It worked fine until it died. I would not buy another one.
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I read this book hoping to hear a well thought out and biblically based reason for pacifism. I was let down. I felt that the author began with the innate assumption that Christians should be anti-war, and then used very little scripture (which was often taken completely out of context) to support his claim. It seemed to be much more of an appeal to emotion, rather than a conclusion that follows from reading the Bible. I also felt that this book should have addressed some of the counterarguments to pacifism. It didn't. I really believe that the author had the agenda of pushing pacifism, and was hoping that the reader wouldn't take the time to critically analyze his suppositions and arguments.I would instead recommend reading some of the works of John Howard Yoder, which seem to be much more thought out and supported."
4,Philosophy and theology finally meet the road,"Most of the thinkers and writers championing the case for Christian pacifism, while nuanced and intellectually capable, lack any forthcoming advice when it comes to practically applying nonviolence and Jesus' testament into real-world setting. This book not only gives a historical explanation for our violent and militaristic ideals, it debunks the mythos around them by highlighting the life of Christ. For those who like banal rote and academic rhetoric and are content with leaving this issue in a heady safety of ideals, this book certainly satisfies the cerebral pursuits of the topic but challenges the reader to apply the theology into a daily practice of love and wisdom."
4,hope you get what you ordered,"First off let me say that if you get the film with Meng Fei and Liang Kar Luang which is on the cover you will be getting a first class film, but the title and the actors advertised dont match. So to sum it up I will critque the cover not the film because I dont know what film you are getting."
5,Wonderful If You can Find a Copy,"Having read some of Jo Beverley's later novels I set out to read everything she's written. Emily and the Dark Angel is a marvelous story of Piers Verderan and Emily Grantwich.The very proper Emily, thought firmly on the shelf at six and twenty, had a very uncommon introduction to Piers ""The Dark Angel"" having been doused with powder as it was being thrown at Piers.They do say that opposites attract and try as she could to fight it, Emily does feeel drawn to this uncommon Rake. How she fights both her feelings and learns to break out of the standard mold that the period seems to put females in is a delicious romp made to come alive through the talented pen of Jo Beverley.If you are lucky enough to locate a copy of this earlier work, you will definitely enjoy it. A real keeper."
3,No Chemistry!,"I enjoyed reading this BUT... where was the chemistry? I didn't feel that there was anything much going on between the two of them. Ver seemed to suddenly be in love with Emily for no apparent reason other than a couple of not very promising meetings. This was a sparkle free zone for me. Perhaps the author ""felt"" the chemistry but she certainly didn't transfer it into print.The story was OK. Some of it felt extremely contrived. Particularly the weird agreement to marry Ver if she goes hunting. Surely if she was developing into a strong women she could make separate decisions about hunting AND getting married without that ridiculous arrangement, which only served as a plot device.Interesting for the hunting detail which the author obviously researched at length, but not a great romance."
4,Duties of the Heart - Boxed Set,"Duties of the Heart (2-Volume Set, Pocket-Size Edition)NOTE: I should have bought the pocket sized edition! It's my only regret with the purchase as the volumes I selected are too big to carry around in a handbag or pocket.This is considered ""among the rarest jewels in the crown of Jewish spirituality"" and it does not disappoint. It is about one's inner life: reflection, trust, sincerity, discipline and trust.MUST READ for anyone seeking to explore the inner potential for wisdom."
5,Great,"Book arrived in a timely fashion. Attractive, hard cover in 2 volumes.Well thought out book. Very detailed. Written centuries ago, so scientific references are not really useful, but philosophy and interpretation of the Torah and God's plan is extremely helpful."
2,Ho Hom shopping experience,"This book was a disappointment. Gershman mainly suggests the stores that fit her style which is, in her words, non-trendy and older. She omits many of the one-of-a-kind boutiques that make New York a truly unique shopping experience...a time to savor and discover the new styles that one only reads about in magazines and sees on the E! channel. Instead, she leads shoppers to chain stores and common mall fixtures, which would be ok...I do want to know where the Gap is located. But, she mentions the same stores over and over...pointing out each location all over the city. If purchasing a shopping guide, consider Fodor's CityGuide New York. It contained every single bit of information as Born to Shop plus much more."
1,Sad day for kitchen cutlery,"I bought these at a local retailer thinking that Chicago Cutlery was a respectable brand, but when I opened them up, I found that the blades were rather weak and easily bendable, the handles were not well attached, and they weren't very sharp. They had a good variety of knives, but the craftsmanship was terrible. Do not buy these!"
2,Low End Knives,Agree with the above 2 reviews. The workmanship is fair at best. The sharpest knife cuts the apple with more effort than my 5 years old serrated knife. Bought on sale from a retailer. I am taking them back
4,Not bad,I love Chicago Cutlery this is a good basic set. I wish it wasn't all serated edges but for a wood handle set of set of Chicago Cultery its a good entry level set.
2,Made Cheap,The tip of the plug broke and got stuck in the power outlet for me as well. Also it has a very bright blue LED that is way too bright for the inside of a vehicle at night.
1,GARBAGE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"SAME AS THE OTHER REVIEWS, PIECE OF GARBAGE, TIP BROKE OFF, KEPT ON BLOWING FUSE ON UNIT, & THEN BLEW FUSE ON MY VEHICLE. BLUE LIGHT WAS TO BRIGHT WHILE DRIVING & I HAD TO COVER IT WITH TAPE, SO IT WOULD NOT SHINE WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT.PURCHASED A CHEAPER UNIT FROM DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER & WORKING JUST FINE."
1,Not worth it,"Very cheaply made, broke the first time we used it. The part that goes in the cigarette lighter socket split apart when we tried to pull it out of the socket."
3,Fairly Nice Little Book,"Fun to look at the altars photographed for the book, but majority of them have Southwest/Hispanic feeling, which seems to infer that that's the only style of altar around. Not so. Many people are building/assembling altars with a wide range of materials. Author could have done a lot more with her topic by showing a wider variety of altars."
5,"A graceful, thoughtful look at how we remember.","What a wonderful book. Jean McMann's luminous photographs, paired with her subjects' words, combined to create an enlightening, moving experience for me. I enjoyed the many different kinds of stories and shrines, from the simple little computer shrine, to a more elaborate wedding mantle, to the very moving shrines to deceased loved ones and beloved pets. This book makes me realize that creating concrete ways to remember and commemorate important events and people is a natural, almost involuntary part of human nature. We create shrines, big and small, all the time without realizing it. The simple way we arrange family photos on our living room mantle, the way we arrange a vase of flowers next to a candle next to a souvenir from a meaningful trip...that's a shrine. The realization of this has helped to bring spirituality and grace into my life."
1,An extremely thin look at a very interesting subject,"I must say that I was looking forward to Altars & Icons for months, and was surprised at the superficial treatment of the subject, which suggests that any collection of stuff on bedside table, windowsill or knick-knack stand is an altar. If ""spiritual"" can be equated with ""nostalgia"" perhaps that is true, but most of the visuals weren't even appealing, and looked as if they had been ""set-up."" While the presentation by Chronicle was simple & slick, the writing was over-all (with a couple of exceptions) very thin and uninteresting. I do hope this collection points the way to other more meaningful texts on personal home altars and handmade icons. I was just chagrined that this particular book didn't even scratch the gilded surface."
2,"Dull, don't waste your money.",I flipped through this book and wondered why I bought it. Gave it away. Nothing very creative.
4,Great first cradle for toddlers to use,"This is a good cradle for toddlers to use for their babies. It is a little flimsy, I completey agree, but my daughter has been using it since she was 15 months old (she's now 23 months old) and we haven't had a problem with it breaking. She's not a rough kid, though.My complaints: the flimsiness of the cradle and the inside liner/sheet does not stay put, which is a problem when your little one keeps bringing it to you to reattach every couple of minutes. I finally had to use the glue gun to glue the sheet to the cradle so that the liner would stop coming out. This will be a problem if the sheet ever gets dirty and I have to wash it but that most likely won't happen unless something gets spilled in it. It's very cute, though, and my little one loves putting her dollies to bed."
4,Novel idea to a real candle,Flickering bulb very real candle-like. Nice variety of shapes. Can recharge multiple candles at once. Wish the candles were larger in size.
4,I Like It!,I put this product into immediate use upon receipt and it has been operating as described ever since. Looks very realistic and is pleasing to look at. Very satisfied with this purchase.
2,light is too orange,"I am so disappointed by the color of the light this gives! The flickering and the glow are nice, but are completely ruined by the horrible greenish orange color of the light. It reminds me of terrible flourescent lighting, like the utilitarian street lamps you see all over the NJ suburbs. It really looks nothing like the lovely white glow in the pictures on amazon and the Philips website."
1,This could have been so cool . . .,"I purchased this candle because of the Philips name. The candle flickering effect is good, but the color of light that it produces is all wrong. The light is too yellow. The candle light to me does not look like the advertised picture regardless of the ambient lighting situation in which the candle is placed. Philips really missed it on this one. The fake candle light bulbs that have been around for years and years which you can buy at Home Depot are more realistic. I hope that Philps fixes this problem in version 2.0. I plan on opening the candle up this weekend in hopes that I can change the tint of the material used to color the light. On a positive note, the battery seems to meet or exceed the advertised run time."
3,Novelty that isn't worth the money,"They are pretty, have a nice effect, and work well. The price truely wasn't worth it though. The charging cord is nice in that it has a magnet to make it easy to quickly charge the base, but you have to take the base out of the candle holder, and it is too easy to accidentally connect the charger backwards. It still lights up and everything but you haved to realize(or read manual to find out) that red is backwards and green flashing is charging."
4,A nice little cozy,"This third in the Pennyfoot Hotel series is a comfortable little cozy. I find that I enjoy the characters in this book (especially the serving staff), and the mysteries are usually a little tricky puzzle like this one. Cecily is faced with having her hotel connected to a ring of jewel thieves and to a murder, so she must set out to solve the murder on her own with the help of the faithful Baxter. It all starts with the wrong body in a casket at a funeral. These books are set in Badger's End during the English Edwardian era, so that also makes them interesting. These little stories are a lot of fun."
1,Bad light,A book light should:1)Light up the page enough that you can read the entire page without repositioning it2)Not be so bulky that it is difficult to adjust it.This book light does not meet either criterion. The light is dim and unfocused and it needs constant adjustment. I had high hopes for it but it just doesn't do the job.
1,Not Enough Light,I was not happy with this light either. The light is not bright enough for me and it seems to be getting dimmer and dimmer the more that I use it.It's awkward trying to keep it clipped to the book too.I'm in search of a better book light!
3,Lives up to its genre,"This is my first Ashworth book. I didn't like it enough to buy it new, but enjoyed it enough to pick it up if I ever see it in a used bookshop. Interesting characters, decent storyline, good pacing. The only frustrating part for me was near the very end, when Olivia can't seem to move beyond Sam's past, particularly one person in his past. That kind of holier-than-thou attitude from a married woman who sleeps with a man NOT her supposed husband (and worse, her supposed husband's brother) wasn't plausible for me. There might have been a better way to add a dramatic element at that point in the book. But other than that, I found it a fairly decent read. Definitely a ""good"" book in the sense of something worth reading as you laze by the pool on a warm summer afternoon."
5,Great Read! Everything a Romance is Supposed To Be!,"Adele Ashworth always does a great job of creating interesting characters, and she always keeps the sexual tension high. Good job, Adele! It's too bad Avon won't reward her with better covers. She's certainly one of the top romance writers of the day!"
4,Easy Read,I enjoyed this book. I thought the characters were believable. Guilty pleasure reading with the ending tied in a bow...
2,"Poor dialogue, poor characters","Adele Ashworth can't write dialogue. Her characters speak as though they live in the 21st century. It's very jarring to read a historical novel and have the characters speaking modern language. The characters themselves are poorly drawn. They have inconsistent personalitites. And maybe it's just me, but it's difficult to root for a heroine who is completely gorgeous, witty, and well-to-do. Couldn't she be human at all? I'd skip this offering and read a historical by someone like Cathy Maxwell, Tracy Warren, Elizabeth Thornton, or Galen Foley, writers whose books were released on the very same day as this sorry one."
5,Perfect,"Thank you so much. I was a little worried about the shipping of fine china. Not only did it arrive in 5 days (standard shipping), it arrived in show room shape. Hope this review helps you out."
5,"A Great Read for Middle Schoolers, too","I teach middle school. For years, I've used The Recess Queen as a class touchstone. I read it aloud the first week of school to an enraptured audience. As the year progresses, we go back regularly to The Recess Queen. Plot structure, characterization, rhyme, literary terms -- the whole enchilada. It's not only great fun and a fine story, it's a fantastic teaching tool. And every time I bring it up, they smile."
2,Playground Despot,"Mean Jean may rule the playground with an iron fist, but it takes newcomer Katie-Sue to stand up to her by taking the offensive - offering to jump rope with her. All well and good, but it does not really address the very real issue of playground tyranny. Not all bullies are amenable to overtures on the part of their peers and Katie-Sue seems an overdrawn literary ploy. I did not like the illustrations, finding them overly large and the colors gaudy and garish. I didn't like the way the characters were drawn at all and found them physically unappealling. Mean Jean was especially unappealling with her oversized head and perpetual sneer. I also disliked the nonsense rhymes, e.g. ""lollapaloosh,"" ""kitz and kajammer."" What saved this from receiving a one-star review was the good faith effort to tackle the issue of playground despots.""King of the Playground"" by Naylor, et al. is vastly superior to this book. However, this is a good effort."
5,"Hoppity, skippity, jumpity, ringity, zingity, YESSSSSS!",I recently read this book to a first grade class. The children loved the fabulous illustrations and the fun rhyming language in the story. Of the 4 books I read the girls seemed to all prefer The Recess Queen. I am going to look up other books by both the author and illustrator. They both have great style.
3,Mean Jean the Recess Queen,"My kids like this book, I think it is ok! It is the illustrations that really make it. As for sending a message about bullying....it isn't crystal clear!It's nice enough, my kids like it and that is what matters!Recommended for 4-7 year olds."
5,"Amazing, Rockin', Sexy Music!",HannaH*s Field CD is a great cd to rock out to or lay back and chill to. The singers voice reminds me of a modern Janis Joplin-but more positive. The guitar work is so cool and takes you on a ride. Awesome!
5,Inspirational,"I am an experienced martial artist but am new to the world of Taekwon-Do. I LOVE this video! Each of the patterns are demonstrated first by Grand Master Tae Sun Kang with amazing precision. His students (also black belts as well) then demonstrate the pattern in a step-by-step fashion, pausing to show the applications in defense. Grand Master narrates the steps, describing them in detail.The initial pattern performed by Grand Master Kang is what you should be striving for. It was well worth the price and I have used it several times to perfect my footwork and pick up little nuances that make the pattern look more crisp and efficient. I would highly recommend this video to adult beginners or intermediate students of Taekwon-Do."
4,Taekwondo Forms,I found this DVD and Volume two to be very helpful. Practice is needed though. Watching GMaster Tae and his students makes me sleepy because energy of thought is greater than performing the forms. These DVDs demonstrate the intensity where books lack to instruct; however both are recommended as an aid to second sourcing instruction in this great art.
2,Way too fast and not enough instruction,"I was looking for clear step by step instructions to improve my form. This instructor performs the moves way too fast, making it impossible to follow grasp what he is doing. To make it useful I will need pause and rewind a lot."
3,Traditional Taekwondo Forms Volume One,"Great DVD for ITF TaeKwon Do beginners; However it is not a true ITF TaeKwon Do DVD also Master Tae Sun Kang doesn't appear to be a true ITF TaeKwon Do instructor. These forms could have been performed better by many students, all the patterns performed by Master Kang were done much too fast."
4,"Sturdy, Good Garbage Truck","Love how this comes with a hard-hat, a little garbage man and two garbage bins, but wish its bin-loading mechanism weren't just placing the bins in the back. We'd probably prefer one of those side-loaders, although this has been a well-loved truck and is certainly built to take abuse."
3,Tonka Lights and Sounds Sanitation truck,"My granddaughter is fascinated with ""garbage trucks"", however, our real trucks do not have flashing light bars on top. She enjoys the little trash cans in the back of the truck the best."
2,Too simple - but too hard!,"My 7 and 8 year old love the Guitar, but the games are lame. Too simple in terms of gameplay which easily bores them, but the fingering expectationsare far to advanced for most little ones. Even at $5, it wasn't worth it."
1,Wrong Color!,"The photo of the lime green ""color block"" duvet is not what you'll receive. I received a different design and a light brown duvet. Beware!"
4,The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel (Biblical Resource Series),"The book is useful because it brings many information about archeoloy findings and hidden references in Bible about the other gods from Israel. However, the author does not structure the hidden references or archeology findings over the time showing the evolution of devotion in different phases of Israel history."
2,Scholarly Treatment,This book is extremely heavily footnoted and reads like an article in a scholarly journal. On many pages the footnotes cover nearly the entire page. Most of the footnotes are not discussions but reference after reference after reference to other works. Not for the layman.
3,Acme Siren Whistle,It is not as loud or strong as I expected. I am not sure if there are other models or not. This was a bit disappointing.
3,acme Siren Whistle,"Works great, but the picture showed an all-metal whistle and the one I received has a black plastic mouth piece. It was expensive, but works well.Acme Metal Siren Whistle"
4,Fantastic Yoga Video,"The Art of Flow Yoga is a great new DVD on Flow Yoga. While there are a number of videos out, this is the first one that takes flow yoga breaks it down into simple but yet advanced Flow Yoga. Yoga and Flow Yoga taught by Zuzana is great for beginners as well as experienced practioners. I find this DVD a great addition to my practice."
4,Good shoes,"I find these shoes are very comfortable for walking and light hiking. They have a good grip, but not as good as the lugs on Vibram-soled hiking boots. The sole design is such that the shoes pick up fewer pebbles than most.The lacing eyelets are all metal-lined to let the laces move smoothly through them. This is different than previous versions. It means that the lace tension will even out after you walk a bit. Great for me. May not be good for you if you try to do trickly lacing (say, looseness on the instep and tightness around the ankles)."
5,Where's the rest?,"A previous reviewer states that the absence of the complete score on cd is the 'biggest whole in the catalog'. It's worse than that - it's a travesty. We have Cleopatra on two discs, Ben Hur on 2, King of Kings on 2 - the list goes on. Where's Spartacus? The bootlegs have the unpublished cues - in STEREO - so they're out there - waiting. We're waiting . . . . to BUY it."
1,"Awesome Score, Terrible Mastering","Too bad there's no score isolation on the Spartacus DVD because the mastering of the CD sountrack is absolutely terrible. Hiss abounds everywhere, instruments are blurred together--there's absolutely no separation. In a nutshell, this CD hardly sounds better than the LP, which is a shame, since it's one of the greatest scores ever. Fans of the score should know that the Criterion laserdisc of Spartacus featured various tracks which did not make it to the film. They were all absolutely beautiful. So just know that not only does Spartacus receive a painfully bad mastering, but also that there are quite a few unheard tracks rotting away in some studio vault, heard only by a few who bought the brilliant Criterion Collection LD set."
4,Wonderful but incomplete,"Having listened to this wonderful music by Mr. North, I must concur with some of the previous reviewers - this is great CD that could have been much better with the inclusion of the full soundtrack. One example - the Spartacus Love Theme on the CD is actually the exit music arrangement, though it's not indicated as such. The first exposition of this theme - when Spartacus first meets Varinia, played by an oboe - is unfortunately not included. There are numerous other examples. What is included is marvelous and very moving, but what a shame that this soundtrack was not given the lavish attention of Ben Hur ( rightly so, I might add ). Alas, maybe someday...until then, enjoy."
5,Classic Alex North.,This is a powerful score by Alex North and I think he should have won the Oscar in 1960 for Best Original Score. He lossed to Ernest Gold's Exodus which is good but doesn't sound as good as this one. I would like to see an extended version of this album in the future because only a fraction of the score is on this CD but it's worth it.
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this product. I am so glad I went to check this out at the library before buying. The exercises were boring and repetitive. I did get a good warm-up from it. But other than that, this movie let me down fully."
2,Hemalayaa: Bollywood Dance Blast,"I didn't like this video at all. I was torn between ordering a Zumba video or this. I really like Indian dance music, so I thought I'd give this a try...I was really disappointed!"
2,Would not reccomend,I thought this was boring and I am not so coordinated. The moves were not as easy as I thought they would be and I just could not get the hang of it. I have the booty workout of hers and would defintly be more apt to do that one instead.
2,Not like Zumba!,"I was not very impressed with this video. I was looking for a more fast paced Zumba flow and it wasn't. However, on a positive note...my three-year-old daughter loves dancing to it."
2,Not her best,"Having danced and enjoyed Hemalayaa's DVDs many times, I was really looking forward to this release. However, I was disappointed. The choreography was repetitive - a surprise given that the choreographer was KMG who did Bollywood Burn, Bollywood Dance Workout and Bollywood Booty, all far more entertaining and complex workouts. The narrative was irritating and directed excessively towards spiritual healing and cleansing which would be fine in small doses but not every two minutes. It felt like a quick-release production lacking in complexity. I'm saving it for my dull days."
2,Disappointing.........,"The cover model (or firefighter) is beautiful, sexy, and provocative. One may think this video has much to offer. Well, no, it's not. Even if the mission and vision of putting together this calendar may be noble (Firefighter Fundraising - we often think back to 9/11, and the many lives we have lost, among others).The video is boring and truly disappointing. It just doesn't flow and, unfortunately, it is not in tune with the message the cover is trying to send. If you feel generous you rather send a donation to the firefighters directly. Do not waste time and expectations buying this video. It's not worth it."
2,Low output that require frequent refills.,"This is an inexpensive humidifier that is simple to maintain but runs out of water halfway through the night. When turned down to conserve water it seems to have little effect on my medium sized bedroom as compared to my daughter's Crane Adorable 1 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier - which lasts far longer than a single night (even on ""high"") and makes her room very comfortable in the dry winter months). My wife and I ended up buying another Crane Adorable 1 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier for our bedroom and giving away the Honeywell."
3,Too small for all night use.,"THe first thing odd is that I waited almost 3 weeks for delivery of this item. This is a first for merchandise ordered on Amazon.Com. I am spoiled I guess with the fast arrival of most stuff....almost instant gratification. Then I realized it is quite small and runs out of water before a full evening and nighttime in my bedroom. I was a bit surprised because it doesn't look small in the ad and holds less water than indicated...Now, after 10 days I can't get it to produce steam at all although the light comes on...So I should have purchased a larger more expensive humidifier."
2,Misleading product description,"The water capacity of this humidifier is 1 gallon, not the 2-gallons that might be expected from Honeywell's name: HWM910 Warm Moisture 2 Gallon Humidifier. If you read the fine print, it says that it will output up to 2 gallons of water per day. Of course, to get this output, one would have to fill it up twice. Someone at Honeywell needs to fired or indicted for misleading the public and soiling Honeywell's brand name."
3,only last for one winter,"It was fine at the beginning, but then you need to clean up the residue in a weekly basis, which is kinda time consuming. I was glad that I had it last winter and it worked great. This season, I used it a few times and it worked fine, but it suddenly stopped working."
5,Perfect for small apartment,"We bought this small humidifier after returning the Honeywell HCM-6009 QuietCare 9-Gallon Console Humidifier with Air Washing Technology. The HCM-6009 was an enormous, noisy, high-maintenance, monstrosity that took up a lot of space and required $30 filters. If you are loaded and have a big place, it might work great for you.Four our less than 400 square foot apartment, the Enviracare is a much better fit. We have it on the dresser and run it most days and every night. If you fill it right before bedtime, it will run all night on the Low setting. So what I do is fill it up when I get home from work, run it on High to get the room air moist, then refill it to run on Low while I sleep.After schlepping the unwieldy HCM-6009 tanks to the bathtub to fill, refilling the Enviracare tank in the kitchen sink is no sweat. It makes occasional gurgling sounds that my husband and I find soothing.There are no filters, it's super easy to clean, and dirt cheap. What's not to love?"
3,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this humidifier. It's a sleek design, easy to remove the tank and fill it up. And it does not leak. For most people I think this humidifier would work great. But I am an extremely light sleeper. Every 10 minutes or so the machine makes a soft bubbling noise that would wake me up every time I was about ready to fall off to sleep. So for me it was not a match."
3,Doesn't last long enough,"I originally liked this humidifier because of its compact size but I guess there's a drawback to being small. You can only fill one gallon, not TWO, and if you put it on the high setting, it won't even last through the night! On the low setting, it probably will last through the night. That kinda sucks because you sometimes need a little more moisture and who wants to wake up just to fill water in a humidifier?I haven't had any problems with maintenance and I've had it for two seasons now. I might put this in my daughter's room and keep it on the low setting, and buy a larger one for my room."
4,Good humidifier,This is the third humidifier we have tried and we like it the best. The tank is a little small so you have to refill probably two to three times a day if you run it non stop but overall very satisfied. Easy to fill and clean and make no noise.
2,disappointed,"Works well, but does not hold 2 gallons of water as stated. Whenyou fill the container it holds only 1 gallon. It seems like wefill the container at least twice a day... not pleased.."
2,Use at own risk,"Same thing happened to me as other poster stated, it worked fine for about two months, then stopped working. I opened it (easy to do because the entire thing is snapped together rather than screwed in) and found a ton of residue blocking the water from steaming out. I cleaned it out and it still doesnt work very good. When it was working it did it's intended job, I don't blame them for my water having so many deposits but I do find fault in the design and operation."
5,Great Product,This little humidifier works great in my extra bedroom. Keeps the air nice and moist. Juli
1,"too small, cheap","The first night I woke up to burnt smell and this unit was hot. Although I had filled it fully, the water was all gone. Later I read the manual and I could not find any mention of auto-shut off !! It does not have it.The material used is plastic, not the hard polycarbonate that can withstand higher temps. So now, (probably due to the high temp incident), my unit has the shell 'caved in' at 2 locations. It is still working though (been a week now).The moisture pumping capacity is also low. Of course, as others pointed out the water capacity is also low.I am already shopping for a replacement.11/2008 Update: I stand corrected. This one does have auto-shut off. I have used for more than 1 month and it has not run hot again even though the water runs out. I still rate it low (2 stars) as water capacity is small."
4,"good product, quiet and easy to use",it is quiet and easy to use. Just fill the tank and turn on the power.Good for a relatively small room.
4,I Keep it in my Pocket,"It's great for me because I'm an older guy working with this fine camera. While the camera is easy to make fundamental settings, it has a lot of subtle control refinements that have the potential to make good pictures great. I'll keep it in my pocket and review it from time to time (when forced to wait or when sitting on the can). I won't need it after all the camera's features become second nature. Of course it's just a helper and doesn't take the place of a full size manual."
1,a book only a hipster could love,"First: ""...there was going to be more tenderness in the world starting right now and spreading out from this room. Especially if we installed a webcam. Global tenderness would raidate from us in waves..."" (the narrator is at a party on the night of September 10, 2001).Then they wake up the next morning: ""A huge gout of smoke was pouring from a lateral tear in one of the towers, six blocks away; and suddenly, beneath the massive buildings, under the tall sheer sky, I felt obscene and small, like a fly batting at the bottom of a TV screen.""Gag me with a spoon."
4,Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed this book. It was awhile ago now, but I remember it being a great read. I don't relate to the protagonist that much, yet I empathized with his conundrums and love of European backpacking women."
1,Sorry,This book was boring from the start. The dumb one liners made it seem like the author was auditioning for the comedy club circuit. Dwight feels like he was drawn for the sole purpose of gaining the readers sympathy--I just thought he was a spineless dweeb-- which becomes abundantly apparent the longer you read the book. And yet I'm supposed to suspend disbelief and think all of these pseudo-intellectual phrases and wildly errant use of the English language come from his comatose mind. Doesn't add up.
3,Novel by Kunkel,We knew this author when he was growing up in a small town in Colorado and I bought it mainly out of curiosity and to give him a boost in sales. Not really my type of reading but it was interesting.
1,This Book Was Lousy!,"I'm almost finished with it, now. I quit at one point and started it again. I like reading lousy books by talented people. He has a tiny bit of talent. Perhaps, in the future, he will sit down and actually write a good book. But this book was lousy, though maybe 20 year old boys like it - I dunno! I did liked the character, Alice, but felt that her description lacked depth so I did not really get to know her. I felt this way about almost all of the characters - that they were thinly depicted - with the exception of Dwight. AND THERE ARE NO PEAR TREES IN MANHATTAN,DUDE!"
3,A Good Start To A Book That Doesn't Finish Well,"I read Indecision cover to cover on a cross country flight from the east to west coast and while I REALLY enjoyed the first half of the book, it simply falls apart towards the end. I appreciate what Kunkel is trying to do when he sends his characters to South America, but the final twists and turns just don't work. Also the final chapter of the book is dreadful, it's as if Kunkel had no clear vision of where to go with the story so he just plummeted into a dogmatic diatribe for some sort of climax. I will be interested to see what Kunkel does next, he does have potential to be a really strong writer, I just wonder if all the exuberant praise he got on this one will stall his real need to continue to refine his craft."
2,Amazing reviews,"I was really impressed with the professional reviews Indecision received. They must have been written by friends of the author, because this is, quite simply, a bad book. Witticisms are sprinkled throughout, but nearly always feel preplanned, and stand out from a silly plot and premise. If you find my review lacking, it is because reading Indecision has made me dumber."
1,From great to garbage,"I've never seen a book start off so great and end so poorly. The first half of this book was excellent, especially the way he captured being a 20-something in New York City. Once he went to Ecuador, however, it was worse than the fiction of a middle schooler writing a class assignment. To me it felt like the part in New York was non-fiction based on the authors' actual life; when he went to Ecuador, however, it was obvious it was stricly fiction and the author's imagination was not up to par with his experience. The twist was absolutely predictable, the ending pointless. The only point seemed to be that the answer to life lays in psychodelic drugs, but to me its as if the author took so many drugs he convinced himself he had something important to say. Or maybe this does capture our generation - baked and talentless."
1,prep school fiction,"This book wants to hug itself. Oh so precocious. It imagines readers with eyes dancing delightedly from word to word -- readers who would unabashedly guffaw, isn't he so clever! Myrna, read what this young boy wrote!!I found the book trite and faintly repugnant, an exercise in preening vanity, and neurotic.Authors should eschew mirrors."
2,be decisive & skip this one.,"bill dungs romani had such high expectations for this brooklyn-hipster, but I was disappointed by this novel. first of all, the prose seemed to be mediocre at best. second, the main character isn't much different from the boring pseudo-intellectual white male hipsters floating around williamsburg, brooklyn, who have trust funds & are perpetually writing their ""great american novel."" third, the ending just seemed so contrived, as though the author just tacked something on after a few spitballs had missed the target."
4,worth reading,"i do think the book got progressively worse as it went on, (full disclosure: i often feel that way, even with the classics) however it started out so good that on balance i still think it was worth the read. It paints a very accurate portrait of a generation while telling a great story."
5,Very fun and entertaining~!,"This book was amazing, dont let anyone tell you otherwise. Either u love it or you hate it, I guess. I want him to write some more books because this one was so good!"
3,eh,"I wanted to like this book much more than I did. There are some interesting ideas, but the prose is downright difficult to get through at points and at the end, the plot is maddeningly simple."
3,Amusing and Trite,"As a post-philosophy student, this book was very amusing. Unfortunately, the ending dissapoints."
2,Doesn't quite pull it off.,The writer has talent - that's almost a given. But the promising protagonist's depth is slowly wasted by a tediously improbable voyage and a tedious and vague female lead. Disappointing.
2,Half way through and don't care enough to finish...,"Wow...I checked out the book on CD because I didn't have anything on the horizon. It looked amusing. Self-involved junk. I have one rule for books. If there comes a point at which I just don't care how it ends (or even how the next page goes), I quit reading. Not knowing what you want from life is not unusual. Don't bother writing about it unless you can make it interesting. If I hadn't been busy cooking, I wouldn't have bothered to get as far as I did. Oh well."
3,Ehhh...,"I picked this up on sale at a book store and thought it looked like an interesting read based on the description. There were some funny parts here and there. I agree with the other reviewers that it went downhill when the main character goes to Ecuador (which is about half way through). What I disliked the most, however, was how the book just stopped without a real good ending to the story and just started going on and on about the author's political views. I don't think it was the worst book I've ever read, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it to anyone else."
1,Publicists in high places,"The true praise for this book should be reserved for its publicist and the strings they pulled to get the three glowing reviews I've read. If this were indeed a talented rendering of the cultural overload created by an abundance of meaningless possibilities, it would be both more self-aware and more varied in its rendering of supporting characters. Instead, it reads as a self-engrossed blog. Some credit is due the author for approximately 20 pages describing a show down with his father. Taken alone, these pages would make a compelling short story. Smothered in the rest of the text, they are not enough to convince me that the purchase price and reading time were well spent."
1,Read Almost Anything Else,"Man, is this what passes for a novel now? This book is a windy, completely conventional coming-of-age story of an uninteresting prep school alumnus. The prose gets annoying after about five pages. The incidents are stupid, the plot predictable, the politics tacked on. Why did this book get so much hype? I'm not the only one: 7 out of 8 people in my book group loathed it."
2,Steering Arm,"Arrived at my door and it fits, but it came with rust on it! Almost looks like a bad refurbish job."
3,A good film to get into B&W,"I think the best use of this film is to get aquainted with the wonderful world of black and white. It's biggest feature, from the perspective of an beginner, is that you can drop it off at any old lab and they will do a good job processing it. Very few labs do an acceptable job with traditional (non-C-41 process) black and white film, but they are all set up for C-41.For the person who does there own processing, this film has a few limitations. Being C-41, it is more difficult to process for the home darkroom, and you don't have the same level of contrast control as you have with ""regular"" Black and White films. Still, it is really fine grained.Overall, this film is pretty low contrast, and thus records a good tonal range. It scratches very easily though, so be careful with your negatives."
3,Fun as a toy.....,"I bought this film because I ran out of Tri-X in the middle of a trip and it was all I could find in B&W. On the plus side, it can be processed by your neighborhood 1-hour shop and it has pretty fine grain for 400 speed film. It also seems fairly forgiving of incorrect exposure. I have two problems with it: -firstly, it's just as expensive as Kodak's T-MAX 400CN film, a higher quality chromogenic (i.e. color-process) B&W film. -secondly, if you do any of your own processing and/or printing, this stuff is just as tricky and temperature-sensitive as color film, and the slightly reddish base color of the film wreaks havoc with contrast, especially if you use multi-contrast paper."
2,Not quite the same,"Although this film is more convenient to develop, I was disappointed with the results. There seemed to be a slight red hue to the prints. Not much contrast, either, though that could have been my fault."
2,"good quality, large, solid.... but too thick on the ends","I found the ends to be too thick to use. It would lift the nail bed too high when I tried to clean under the nail, and I would really have to push the cuticle back harder then necessary in order for it to lift. A friend of mine has a pair of cuticle pushers that are much thinner on the ends, and there is no comparison, they work much better and more easily."
3,Slow to get started.,"This book wasn't difficult to get into, but the action took a long time to get going. The first crime doesn't occur until halfway through the book. And the true hints about whodunit don't happen until the book is nearly finished, so you can't really spend the whole book trying to piece it together. It just happens all at once in the last pages. Arly puts up with way too much and most of the characters are more caricatures. This was my first foray into the Maggody series and it was slightly disappointing, but not an unpleasant read."
3,Life in Maggody Continues,"I have enjoyed the light-hearted books about Arly Hanks, small-town sheriff.This one seems to plod a bit, but it is still fun reading about the residents of this small Arkansas town.It offers a few hours of light, fun reading!"
1,Booger-eating Morons,"I honestly couldn't stand to finish it. It convinced me that cozies involving colorful characters from back-water regions are not for me. I hated Maple Sugar Murders, infested with paranoid and bad-tempered New Englanders. I hated Multrain to Maggody, where the locals seemed all to be booger-eating morons. I don't understand why Arly didn't run screaming from this inbred village back to someplace civilized. I just don't understand the appeal this might have for some people."
2,Too many characters,"This is the second book i have ""listened"" to and they are getting more and more painful. I like the main town characters but with every story she throws in 50 more people to add to the mystery..if i were reading these books i would never make it pass chapter 2. Oh and everyone is rambling these conversations never seem to lead anywhere not as background information, motive or even to a point. UGGG"
1,DOES NOT WORK,I have tried this product on various items and it just doesnt work. The coverage is streaking and looks smeared. There is not a consistant look to it. I have tried various amounts and used numerous types of stencils. Would not recommend wasting money.
5,Hilarious,"At first I rented the DVD from Netflix. Before long, I quickly realized that this was a ""keeper"", returned the item to Netflix, and ordered it from Amazon. Even though the series is British (although I'm sure that means American's will screw it up trying to convert it to an American comedy), I know many friends here in Illinois that are JUST like these guys. Watching these guys is like watching friends get into ridiculous antics. This series shows why British shows (Being Human, Skins, Coupling, etc) are so often superior to many American shows."
3,The Inbetweeners - the Complete Series,"Without knowing or really hearing anything about the Inbetweeners, I decided to go see the movie since it was playing at the local movie theater. I left the theater loving the movie (sadly, the theater was completely empty on Opening Night). I thought the movie was extremely well made and featured a good surprising soundtrack. Anyways, I decided to finally watch the show which was amazing! It was just as good as the movie, if not probably better.Now about this set, I must say I'm happy to own the show, but the video quality is terrible, it very pixelly. It's disappointing that it looks this bad. I thought it looked poor on Netflix, but this is almost the same. The packaging is fairly simple, the case is made from cheap plastic as you feel like it's about to break in your hands, but other than that, it was worth how much I paid, $7 with free shipping so I feel like that's all it's pretty much worth since the picture quality is no Blu-Ray."
2,Uninspired,"If you were faced with the task of introducing someone to Celtic music, then this CD should be close to the bottom of the list. The performances are generally listless and uninspired. Capercaillie are capable of better; the version of Loreena McKennitt's ""The Mummer's Dance"" is simply painful to listen to, as examples. There is no emotion, and certainly nothing to tap your foot to here. Go buy something else."
1,Disappointed,"Yogitoes Skidless Premium Mat-Size Yoga TowelI was very disappointed in this ""skidless"" towel, as I slipped all through my yoga class. When I asked about returning it, I was told that I would only receive 50% back, after one use. Beware of buying something that you are unsure of --- you may lose money in the transaction if you need to return it."
5,Best product!! great for hot yoga,Loved this so much I just bought another!!!! Great for hot yoga or any type of yoga to add comfort and a little extra grip to your mat. get one today.
4,good sleeves,"I've done a lot of research on what card sleeves to use for Magic the Gathering cards and Dragon Shields were typically recommended over ultra pro and other brands. The sleeves are thick and durable and allow you to shuffle without damaging the cards. These are the cheapest ""color"" of the Dragon Shields listed on Amazon, and I actually prefer the clear ones anyway. The only (major) drawback is cumulative shipping cost - expect to pay almost as much in shipping as for the cards themselves. Go figure. Better prices on ebay and elsewhere."
4,Shure N78S - a nice stylus for your 78s,"The Shure N78s is the replacement stylus for the M78s cartridge. The cartridge has a very good sound, especially if you like to archive your collection, either on tape or using the computer.The stylus has a recommended tracking force of 1.5 - 3 grams. This is quite impressive, but has one big negative - warped records. If your vintage recording has a ""buckle"" in it, this can cause the cartridge to smack into the shellac, or bounce around. I really wish Shure had made a stiffer cantilever that tracks heavier (perhaps 3 - 7 grams). Because of this, it is recommended to have another cartridge to play problem records with.Overall, though, this is a fabulous product, and I am quite happy I picked it up. And, of course, Amazon was Amazin'!"
3,Traditional Taekwondo Forms Volume Two,"Great DVD for ITF TaeKwon Do beginners; However it is not a true ITF TaeKwon Do DVD also Master Tae Sun Kang doesn't appear to be a true ITF TaeKwon Do instructor. These forms could have been performed better by many students, all the patterns performed by Master Kang were done much too fast."
5,Great Sound Great Price,This is a very good beginners drum. Having the bag makes transportation easy. I have really enjoyed this Djembe drum.
3,"14"" Djembe by Toca","Most dembes have a tinny sound to them & this is no exception. This djembe is big, It sounds better being played with soft mallets. It's good looking. The bag is nice but it's really tough getting the djembe in or out of it. Like most instruments, a good player can make it sound great. Practice, practice, practice."
5,See other review; nice colours make it a bright idea,"Like in my other review, these quad cases are nice for consolidating 4 disc cd sets; e.g., Crossroads by Eric Clapton, or a jazz set of four cds I have. The colours make it bright, but the other, ""clear"" set is fine. Would be nice if they made these in 10 and larger packs, but otherwise nice item."
1,Do Not Buy this Book!,"This book is atrocious and teaches children how to abuse rabbits and create even more overpopulation than we are already dealing with. Our shelters are already overcrowded with these poor animals who are euthanized by the thousands daily. Why are you wanting to breed more when there aren't enough homes for the ones already born??? This is a disgrace to society, and this book is only adding to an already highly difficult problem.If you want to learn how to REALLY care properly for rabbits, and show them the love that they deserve, try checking out the House Rabbit Society[...]and also check out the book House Rabbit Handbook. Both are very informative with information that benefits the rabbits, not just a way for humans to abuse rabbits for profit."
1,Out of Touch with Reality,"This books, FFA, 4-H, and all breeders are out of touch with the reality of rabbit populations. One female rabbit can in the right conditions give birth to 200 baby bunnies a year!The amount of buns in shelters is staggering and overwelming. In this day of age breeding not a hobby, it is abuse.If you want to raise a bunny go to your local shelter or House Rabbit Society and adopt one. Let is live freely in a bunnyproofed house and NOT IN A HUTCH OUTSIDE or a cage!LOTS of research and preparation must be done before adopting a bunny, they are wonderful creatures but are not as resilient as cats and dogs and need proper care (especially PROPER DIET) for survival, otherwise you are abusing the bunny.I could go on but stop the breeding people."
4,Nice Unit but have not hatch a batch yet,Appears to be a solid unit but still running first batch of chicken eggs. Unit only held 16 large chicken eggs. digital read out is nice and easy to read. hold temperature steady
4,"Vivid, Disturbing - and Powerful","I found this book difficult to read, because it paints such a vivid and realistic picture of an issue I find extremely disturbing - child sexual abuse. The authors do a remarkable job of showing how the victimized child grows into a victimized adult. But I was glad I read through to the end, because they also show the tremendous healing power of forgiveness - God's forgiveness acted out to us and through us, and how it is only through forgiveness that our own healing can take place. A tough read, but one with a message than can change lives."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"After reading the first two novels by Teri Holbrook, I was really looking forward to her third book. I found that The Grass Widow was a great sequel to A Far and Deadly Cry in that the characters of Gale Grayson and her daughter Katie Pru were further developed in a wonderful way. In Sad Water however, to my surprise and disappointment, I felt that the characters of Gale and Katie Pru were rather flat, none of the other characters became really convincing and the relationship between Halford and Gale, which was kept suspended in The Grass Widow, lost all its former tension. The tale itself was clever and the plot intricate, a little too much so for my taste. Michael's Diary provided the story with local colour, but as a focus for the plot it fell flat. All in all, of course, Teri Holbrook is a good storyteller and she kept me reading, but when I had finished the last page, I just thought ' hmm, well ...'."
5,Outstanding!,"In her third novel, Teri Holbrook has again written a gripping suspense novel. The characters are offbeat and the storyline is intense. I couldn't put it down until I reached the ending. I highly recommend this novel to anyone, especially Minette Walters fans."
1,Doesn't work !,"I used this controller once, it worked. Second time, the led doesn't come on. I went camping and my battery went dead. All connections are tight and conected properly. Help, is there anything I can do , to get it to work. Email me at [...] if you have an answer I have the Sunsei 22 watt solar panel. Thanks, Jim"
1,STOP!,"STOP! Do not buy the Leica DUOVID 8X42 - 12X42 binoculars. An outfitter friend and I each bought a pair of these binoculars at the same time, both binoculars failed in the same manner, and Leica did not stand behind either product.Focus does not coincide when changing between 8X42 and 12X42.The mechanism used to change between 8X42 and 12X42 does not operate smoothly, and sometimes sticks and locks up.The eye cups are loose and do not stay at a desired setting.Use caution when buying a Leica product. Properly complete the warranty registration and keep your original receipt if you ever expect to request service."
4,Its typical thomas.,"For some reason my daughter really loves trains. She likes to watch this with her dad and they have a good time doing it. It teaches good moral lessons, with cute little train fables."
4,Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book! It was great feeling like you were a part of it simply because of where it was set...The Bay Area. I felt like I knew Valerie and may run into her any day. The love story between Valerie and Michael reads as it is real and I'm sure many people would be able to relate to their story. Her girlfriends were also ones (friends) that you may have of your own. I would recommend you all to read it, it keeps you going right from the start!"
3,"Interesting storyline, flat storytelling","Valerie's battle with lupus and lung disease impedes her living her life to its fullest, including the pursuit of a romantic relationship. Until she is rear-ended by Michael. The love story begins and the ups and downs of a relationship, in addition to dealing with her health issues are described in great detail. The relationship is interesting, as is her struggle with friendships and illness. I adored the storyline, however I love stories with dialogue. Dialogue makes a story come alive. This story is told in journal format. Sometimes it reads like an author's notes and reflections that should have been fleshed out with dialogue.Because the storyline is good, I'd recommend it with only slight reservations."
1,False Advertising,The battery you will get isn't the Panasonic pictured here. Instead you will get a black aftermarket battery. False advertising.
1,Clock radio,I had a very bad experience. The clock/radio box was all beat up. It appeared that this item had been used before. When I opened the box there were scratch marks on the CD player at the top of the radio. I asked for a return authorization and had to pay to ship the item back. Very expensive. I do not believe that this company is a good company to work with.
4,Great quick reference,"This is a great quick reference with a lot of relevent phrases near similar words and ideas.My only real criticism is that I'm American and the fact that it's written by British folks means that, when looking up words or phrases, you have to think about the way a Brit might phrase it and look it up that way if you cannot find it the first time around (eg, I'd never heard a ""diaper"" referred to as a ""nappy.""). Similarly, because British folks pronounce things differently, the way they've romanized the words is a little funky. For example, the word for ""today"" is pronounced ""wan-nee"" but is written ""wun-nee"" in the book (and the same thing for ""chan"" and ""chun""). So it's something to be conscious of when using this as a reference -- everytime you see a ""u"" you have to decide whether or not it's an ""ah"" or ""uh"" sound.So other than that, it's pretty awesome."
5,Unfurling the Heart by Susea McGearhart,"This is an exciting adventure story with a look into the author's soul. Not just for sailors, but for everyone who likes to travel and to follow adventures first-hand. I felt like I was in the Bahamas actually seeing the sites and encountering the rough waters with McGearhart. She tells the story with a gift of wit, and using a delightful descriptive composition to enhance the account of her personal sailing journey. There is laughter and there are tears throughout her experience, an experience in which you'd like to be included. I recommend this true story for those who like a good love story, a travelogue of adventure, and perhaps, a guide to the beautiful Bahaman Islands."
4,Stephen Kent - 'Oil & Water' (Intuition) 4 1/2 stars,"Stephen Kent's more recent offering. Although this CD is a bit different than his 'Landing' and 'Family Tree' titles, it should still do a lot for loyal followers. Tracks to fully take in (listen to 'em twice) if need be are the eight-minute ethnic / tribal ""Thel Kupa"", ""Ouled Sergo"" (to me, it sounds like maybe a lost Embryo cut that never made it onto an lp), the stunning Lights In A Fat City-like ""Valley Of The Winds"", ""Edge Of Time"" and ""Elders Lament"" (sort of reminded me of possibly Third Ear Band). I know what you're thinking - WHAT am I on tonight? Actually check out all the cool instruments that Kent decided to employ while assembling this piece of work - didgeridoo (of course), frame drum, sintir, bass, guitar and percussion. Hopefully, this CD won't be the last we hear from him."
2,The Eye Care Revolution,"Although the information in this book is good, it is now outdated. I didn't realize how old this book was when I purchased it. Much has gone on in this field since it was written. I would recommend searching for a newer book."
2,"Can't give it more then a two star, because!","When I first got this book, I thought, Wow its big. It should have all the answers and information.But I find it does not.One of the commonest eye problems is ""Macular Pucker"".(although it seems not many people have heard of it!)I could Not find anything written about it in this book!.At that point, I stop reading this book, and was very disapointed."
5,Very Pretty Barbie,"I ordered this Barbie for my 6 year old for Christmas because she loves the tooth fairy and still has many teeth to lose--it comes with a pouch to put under your pillow when you lose a tooth. My daughter still carries her around and plays with her. She comes with a stand for so she can easily display her Barbie on the shelf. Very pretty outfit but fragile. It is more for displaying if you don't want the dress torn. Make-up is nicely done, I think it's the prettiest doll she has."
3,Going down under,"rented the ususal copy from blockbuster, ok. thought, get unrated copy and see what was added. NOTHING MUCH I COULD TELL. not bad , but thought maybe unrated edition would help story line. nada."
4,This is a funny film,"I have watched ""Going Down Under"" a couple times and it just gets better, skinny white dude loses his penis in a meat pie mincing accident, gets a transplant from a dead black porn star and now every time he gets an erection he faints (what isn't there to get???). From Donkey punch to rainbow lick - I repeat most lines from the movie on a daily basis. The soundtrack is ""Real Real Good"", I just love the B&S; ball punch up and Jonno's friends, especially Shane (Paul W. He).If your looking for a great party movie, this is the film to check out!"
1,unclear,"The instruction was hard to follow. Master Chen says step to the right while he is stepping to the left, very confusing. He does not show the movement of the hands, arms, and feet clearly."
4,great dvd,"This was my first time trying Tai Chi, and it was great. The instructional part was difficult for me to follow, but when I proceeded to the basic exercise, I was able to catch on very quickly. His voice is very calming, and the controlled movements will accelerate your heart rate and help you control your breathing."
3,Tai Chi Review,Good in that the instruction goes through both the individual stages and the whole form - but not easy to work with a mirror image of the movements.
3,Man,"This was my first Tai Chi instruction video. I think it was well done but not easy to follow. Perhaps as I mateure in the practice the flow will come. I would still recomend it for those who wish to study the diciplin, especially beginning Martial Arts students."
5,Excellent Learning Aid,Many people expect to learn Tai Chi Chuan from a Video. This is a mistake. You really need to interact with a qualified instructor. This video is an excellent study aid for people who would like a practice guide between actual lessons. It is also a helpful guide for people returning to Tai Chi after an interruption in their practice. You really need an instructor who can observe what you are doing and offer advice. If you want to learn Tai Chi and don't live near a good teacher; then relocate or find something else to do.
1,NOT a beginner DVD,"This is not a DVD for beginners. There is no explanation of the movements. The narration says to ""turn foot in"" but never says which foot, or what part of the foot whether it's the heel or the toes. You're just supposed to mimic the movements shown on the screen, but it's very difficult at times to see what your feet are supposed to be doing because his pants and other leg block the view. There is absolutely no explanation as to what your hands and arms are doing. In one section all the instructions are given as ""sleep"" and ""wake up"". It's very frustrating. It's a beautiful DVD, and it's obvious that Grand Master Chen loves what he is doing, there is just no instruction, and no explanation as to what is really going on."
5,An excellent starting resource for those new to Tai Chi,"Tai Chi for Beginners with Grandmaster William C.C. Chen is a DVD introduction into the ancient Chinese art of Tai Chi, a martial art that can be practiced to reduce stress, strengthen the body and mind, and improve one's bodily well-being. Host William C. C. Chen, one of the most respected Tai Chi Grandmasters of his generation, leads the viewer through fundamental, low-impact routines. Special features include learning segments with continuous loop option; three different complete-form practices centering around basic, counting, and energy; Tai Chi tips; and audio options that include music only or music combined with descriptive instruction. An excellent starting resource for those new to Tai Chi, recommended for public library collections as well as private fitness DVD shelves. 67 minutes (plus 20 min. bonus), 16:9 widescreen."
1,Tai Chi for Beginners with Grandmaster William C.C. Chen,For being a grandmaster & a beginners guide was not informative as I expected it to be. There were not any all around angle shots. If I wouldn't have been so busy I would have returned it for a refund!
1,NOT FOR CHEWERS,"If your dog is a chewer, like my border collie/corgi mix, then DON'T GET IT! The vinyl is very soft and immediately after opening it, my dog chewed and swallowed one end of the toy."
1,False Advertising,We are dog sitting a Yorkshire that had a hot dog toy that looked like this picture. It is one of her favorite toys. It is about a year old and quit making noise. I decided to replace it. Received toy it is all brown. Looks nothing like the picture. It made a noise for about thirty minutes. It ripped down the length of the dog. I would not recommend this toy anyone.
4,Yorkie loves it,Dont know why. My Yorkie loves hot dog toys. But she does. Squeaker didn't last long. Was afraid she would eat would come out whenShe chewed it. So had to throw away. Also. Toy was mis sharpened But not too bad.
3,Life on the Texas Range,"Several pictures from this book were actually taken in southeastern Arizona rather than Texas. The picture of cowboys riding past a Greene and Co store were taken in Hereford,AZ. Col. Greene was a rancher and started the copper mine in Cananea, Sonora, Mexico. His home and headquarters were in Hereford. A resident of the area has this picture and another quite similar, the event was staged. Several other pictures have similar mountains in the background and were most likely taken nearby."
5,"A ""Luvly"" story","Having grown up in the same time frame as Barbara Windsor MBE,and being a big fan of British comedy,I found this bio,very revealing,and at some points,bought tears to my eyes.A very good read.Thanks Bar.XXXOOO"
1,Who is the artist?,"Is this a Crusaders cd or a Richard Beirach cd? Be careful, folks, your don't really know what you'll be getting when you order this. If it is the Richard Beirach cd, I would give it five stars. It is my favorite piano trio cd. Can't say I ever heard the Crusaders cd, but I like the cover."
2,"Received a used, defective heater from ANTOnline","I like the heater itself. However, I ordered mine from ANTOnline (through Amazon). I was suspicious that the heater I received was defective because of the way the cord was loosely wrapped in a rubber band when I took it out of the box. The heater has a bad rattle in it. I contacted ANTOnline. They refused to replace it with the SAME MODEL which is all I asked. They instead told me to send the heater to the manufacturer at my expense. I won't order from this company again as they do not stand behind the products they sell."
1,Difficult,"Overall, this unit comes up short. The nice feature is the remote, but this is where it fails. The user sets a specific room temperature, and once the unit reaches this temp., it shuts off. Then when temp. drops 2 degrees below set temp., it comes back on, bringing room temp. back up to set temp. (like a furnace operates). The problem is, the only way to shut it off is unplug it every night if it is at set temp. (because neither remote nor unit power switch will power it up at this point). If left plugged in, it will just come back on when it gets cool again (at this point only, it can be shut off).The product should really have a manual on/off rocker switch in addition to the front panel power switch to shut it off permanently at the end of the night."

2,Meh...,"Two cats and one dog, and one of our cats -- during summer -- licks his belly to a dew-covered morning grass sheen (slick; all hair gone)! After a while, he'll makes raw spots because he can't stop himself. Long story short, while various vet-recommended prescription ointments work -- we can't apply it continuously. Thought this might work but our cat LOVES it so much, he immediately licks his belly even more!!! (Soft cones are always placed on him after any ointment application -- but this product -- the minute we take the soft cone off, he's nearly EATING his belly.)Back to searching for other healthy/natural alternatives..."
3,Where's the bass on 5.1?,Saw Halford last year with this setlist in Chicago House of Blues. Great show! Was very excited to see this come out. This show was a few weeks or so before I saw them in Chicago so I wanted to have this so to relive. Well the video is great. Whoever recoreded the 5.1 hd audio needs to find other work immediately. There is no L.F.E. at all. In other words my subwoofer only detects sound if I switch it to 2 channel. Luckily I have enough tweaks with my reciever to make it sound decent. I have tried many other bluray music discs just to make sure and well it is only this one. When it starts out for all the recent and updated Halford releases including all the remasters it freaking jams. Then the show starts and you are like I can't hear anything? So then you turn it up. Cool well where is the bass? Oh its in the 2 channel. Well that's just great. Lets just go back to vhs. Halford is the greatest unfortunately the audio dude for this is not.
3,Something is missing,"The sound is 4.5 stars, halford is 5 stars, video edit is 3 stars (change scene every second¡), and for my taste the song setlist is 2.5 stars there are many fillers here and also they forgot to put more songs from the crucible album ( for me the best of halford), i dislike stupid songs like locked and loaded, cyberworld,thunder and lightning, likes theres no tomorrow, fire and ice and of cousre the commercial made of metal. Where is the mower, speed of sound, and hell razor for me the best cut of the last album , this dvd have 11 good songs and the six worst halford songs. Shame that he have so many good songs. Maybe its the fact that i dont like too much the latest album. Hope these words help you with all repect."
4,"Makes you dizzy...but, Rob is awesome","I counted about 60 edits(changing scenes) in one minute. A bit too much but, the music (of course) rocks!!!!!Recommended for Metal Gods!!!"
5,Satisfactied Customer,"Diana Palmer is so good! This is another one of her wonderful novels. Why is it that I always get so upset at the male leads and then fall head over heels for him? It must be because she expresses the male character so well, you can't help but understand his conflict and reactions. I became emotionally involved in this book and it satisfied me in every way!"
3,'S Okay....But not Great,"I had to read this one twice over, to figure out how the h/h managed to do that whole misunderstanding thing like they did. Sabina was okay, and so was Thorn, but good lord! When was this thing published? ""I hate you -- but let's make out MORE!!!""Thorn is quite the Alpha male, and Sabina stands up to him for most of the book, but the ending is -- almost -- disappointing. Very much an 80's romance.The main thing I had against it was the pace -- it just went flyin' on by [another 100 pages would have been a great improvement] and the situation was really contrived, what with Thorn's brother and her best friend and Thorn's parents... still, a good book for an evening in."
5,Sabina and Thorn : perfect characters and perfect couple!,"Funny, touching, passionate. Make me laugh and then cry. There's no doubt, this book is the best novel i've ever read.Read it more and more!"
5,An impressive collection of memorable poetry and commentary,"Ceremonies is an impressive collection of memorable poetry and commentary by Essex Hemphill, one of the few authors who dares to openly portray African American gay life. Raw, compelling, gut-wrenching verse is the hallmark of this serious and powerful compilation. American Hero: I have nothing to lose tonight./All my men surround me, panting,/as I spin the ball above our heads/on my middle finger./It's a shimmering club light/and I'm dancing, slick in my sweat./Squinting, I aim at the hole/fifty feet away. I let the tension go./Shoot for the net. Choke it,/I never hear the ball/slap the backboard. I slam it/through the net. The crowd goest wild/for our win. I scored/thirty-two points this game/and they love me for it./Everyone hollering/is a friend tonight./But there are towns,/certain neighborhoods/where I'd be hard pressed/to hear them cheer/if I move on the block."
3,Be prepared to go shopping,I admit the shocks work fine once installed. Please check the air lines prior to installing. They are not a match to the original AC/Delco. The original air lines in my vehicle are screww on and these shocks are compression. Good luck finding an adaptor kit. They are not included and not readily available.
5,No more hop,"Just put these on my car, 2000 lesabre, what a pain in the ! If your not mechanically inclined I would suggest finding a mechanic to do it or take your car in to a shop. The speed clips on the bottom of the shock G.M. has the shocks mounted to broke and spun around on one bolt on each shock. The head of one of the bolts broke on each shock, ended up cutting the tabs on the shocks so I could get at them better. I used flange bolts and nylon lock nuts to mount them back on. OK enough whining. The shocks are GREAT. My car didn't have what you normally would see with bad shocks you know bouncing up and down, It had tire hop over bumps and vibrations at anything over 65 mph. No more hop, wound 'er up to about 80 smooth as could be, It was like cruising the lake at 5 A.M."
5,EASY AS PIE,"DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THESE SHOCKS --FOUND THAT THESE WERE THE ONES THAT I NEEDED FOR MY 2002 BUICK LESABRE--CHANGING THE SHOCKS WAS AS EASY AS CHANGING A TIRE---ONCE THE TIRES WERE OFF IT TOOK APROX. 10 MIN. PER SIDE--I HAD BEEN QUOTED $362.00 TO REPLACE THESE TWO SHOCKS --AFTER CHANGING THESE OUT, I ORDERED THE FRONT STRUTS (TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MONROE REBATE) THAT TOOK A LITTLE LONGER TO DO BUT BUYING THE QUICK STRUTS IS THE BEST WAY TO GO---AFTER INSTALLING THE STRUTS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED WAS AN ALIGNMENT,WHICH MY DEALER WAS RUNNING A SPECIAL ON, ALL IN ALL, NEW STRUTS --NEW SHOCKS --AN ALIGNMENT --THE CAR DRIVES LIKE IT IS NEW."
2,"Rattle, rattle","These shocks are driving me crazy.. Installing them on a 03 Bonneville with 70K miles due to a leaky factory shock.. I can NOT get these shocks to stop rattling. Anytime I drive on a washboard type road, all kinds of noise comes from the trunk. Swapped out the upper shock mounts- didn't help. Tighten upper nut and bolts, didn't help. Put the factory shocks back on, no rattle- even from the shock that wasn't leaking and still in good condition. I give up. May try another pair to see if I just got a bad set.. Just remember when you install these, that you secure the top/single nut before bolting down the bottom bolts so you don't twist the shock.Only good thing, is these ride nice and are a DIRECT fit to the GM sedans with air level rear suspension.. Not too firm, not soft."
5,Monroe Max-air shocks,Monroe Shocks were exactly the correct fit. Very short installation and great improvement in handling and ride. Price was very good. Especially when compared to taking the car to a dealer for repair.
5,Air Shocks,"These shocks worked great, a straight fit bolt-on with no modifications needed. Easy to install and uses the factory connections already on your car.. The price was excellent. I would recommend for anyone needing to replace the stock airshocks."
4,Awesome replacement.......don't hesitate to purchase.,"I got these as a direct replacement for my rear air ride shocks on my 2000 Cadillac Deville (Base Model)I was worried when I ordered them, fearing that they would not be direct replacements.I was wrong. They are direct replacements, and don't hesitate to purchase them for yourDeville. They are black instead of white, and I am glad.I gave them a 4 star instead of 5 because I believe that they should send the new quick clips and newbolts for attaching the bottom flange to the A-Arm, and a new clip for the air line.I had to reuse the old hardware on the bottom flange, but I just made sure to spray everything down first, andto take my time. Everything worked out and nothing broke."
4,"Great price, great product",You will love the ride and price of these Shocks. I have always trusted Monroe for all my cars and they haven't let me down.
3,"Good Price, but rough ride!",I purchased these purely out of the cost factor. They were less expensive then anywhere I could have purchased them. The only issue is they are really not forgiving at all and it causes the ride to be a bit rough when traveling on rodes that are not perfect. Shipping was quick and item as described.
5,A darn shame,Kodak recently discontinued this film. This is without a doubt the best slide film ever made. The color dyes last for decades of projection. I am very disapointed as there is no good alternative.
5,Get the Facts,"Another reviewer indicates that Kodachrome 25 film is fast film. This is not accurate information. Kodachrome 25 is very slow slide film and requires slow shutter speeds or wide apertures or both. So why buy it? Because it's one of the finest grain, sharpest films ever made. It is best used with a tripod or a powerful flash. It lends itself to serious shooting, but not snapshots. It's a professional-type film. Kodak has been threatening to discontinue this film. That would be a tragic loss. Some of today's finest nature photographs are still made with Kodachrome 25."
4,If you like rap it is a must. It is on!!!,"I will just say this I would look for thier next one. Like the beats,the rappers on it and the songs too!!"
2,Out of Date Instructions,"This WAS a great guide until The Wall Street Journal changed their online format. Now the instructions in this text (7th edition, 2005) are no longer accurate. I would advise against the purchase of this out-of-date edition as it will not ""guide"" you anywhere. P.S. Note the dates when the 'good reviews' were submitted."
5,ON Target,"The problem with too many people who have some extra money to invest is that they listen too much to too many who know too little. Everyone is always looking for the fast money. Often the investment money goes down the tubes with the bad advice promising quick reward.Michael Lehmann has written a book that takes any investor through a thoughtful, fact filled series of lessons on how to use data to make well informed decisions. Listening to Uncle Bob pontificate about his ""Big dollar investment tip"" for the day should go right out the window. Lehmann's ""Using the Wall Street Journal"" should become the primer for anyone who is serious about investing with knowledge. A little reading of the right material pays off. Michael Lehmann's book IS the right material and has paid off for me over and over again."
2,Good but not the best,"The book is generally good despite the fact that it can get very repetitive. The book presents the information in an unorganized fashion. It is very inefficient. It does, however, teach how to read the WSJ if you can manage to overcome these shortcomings. At the start it also gives you a general idea of how the economy works and explanations of key terms. You can learn a lot even is you don't have a clue about economics"
1,Book doesn't match the WSJ Online addition,"This is a great book which I have been using since version 5. I decided to purchase the 7th addition to take advantage of the Wall Street Journal's online addition, however none of the textbook's examples match the online version of the WSJ. Apparently, the WSJ has modified the format of their online addition, but the book has not kept up with the changes. Without accurate information I would not purchase this book. Look for version 8 I guess. I found a website hosted by Professor Lehmann and sent him an email through the website. I got a reply from my email account stating that the email was undeliverable. Once this gets corrected, the book gets five stars, for now, one."
5,My Favorite,I love this episode so much. It is my second favorite from the series. My first is City on the edge of forever. This episode takes you on a ride to vulcan. Spocks home planet. Add this to your collection now.
2,Much better end times books out there,"This book could & should have been much better. The subject matter's quite interesting; I particularly like the angel & demon characters. Problems: editing is surprisingly unprofessional, character development should be better.The Left Behind series & the Christ Clone trilogy by LeBeauSigneur are far superior. Save your money by not buying this book."
4,Fast paced end times story,"All in all this is a very good end times fiction book. For those of you who are ""Left Behind"" fans, this book does not get you as in depth into the characters, but it does get through the whole tribulation period from rapture to Christ's return in one book, unlike the Left Behind books that are making us wait years and volumes to get to the end. I really enjoyed the angel and demon characters that was developed and explored in this book. A great change of perspective and interesting to show the hidden battles being waged for the souls of mankind."
4,You will enjoy this,"This is the first book that I have not put down after the 1st chapter. "" The Age of the Antichrist "" had me turn page after page and not wanting to put it down. Most books take me about three months to get through, this one only a week. It is written so that it is very easy to read. I don't agree with the angels crying and being afraid, but everything else is wonderful about it. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes and or is interested in end-times work."
1,Couldn't make it to the end,"I couldn't finish it While the author's intentions were most assuredly good in writing this Christian novel, his execution failed to meet expectations. Perhaps his other works are more readable."
1,Zero stars,"He must know someone in the publishing business. How else could such a poorly written book make it to the public? Zero excitement, zero character development, zero scene development, I wish there were a way to give it zero stars. Read James BeauSeigneur's series if you want a more believable story."
1,a constant struggle to finish,"I am the type of person that loves a good fictional account of Biblical material but this does not qualify. I've read several End-Times novels (Left Behind, Christ Clone, Fire Of Heaven, etc)that I've enjoyed but this is not one of them. Peretti did spiritual warfare much much better; I found Cash's spiritual warfare narratives absurd. I will try to finish this book eventually because I hate to leave a book unfinished but I expect it will take many weeks to do so.Save your money and buy something else!"
1,Poor Writing,"While Mr. Cash's topic is one of the most open to imagination, he filled his book with trite and overused cliches. I could only read 100 pages before I had to give up on it. I would recommend you look elsewhere to find good literature worth your reading time."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,THIS BOOK WAS NOT WORTH READING. HIS WRITING STYLE WAS BORING AND HE DIDNT DEVELOPE HIS CHARACTERS AT ALL. IT TOOK ME THREE MONTHS TO GET THROUGH THIS BOOK.
5,Enjoyed it Immensely,"This is the first Fil-Am novel I've read and I enjoyed it immensely. The characters will last with me for a long time. After reading the last page it was as if I have come to really know Gringo and Ninang Rola. After reading the last page, I wished the novel didn't end. I guess this was because Realuyo's portrayal of the characters were so realistic that one can see their personalities in real live Filipinos. Even more haunting was the experience Gringo was having the morning he and his brother left the country...from waking at dawn, showering, the final breakfast, the rain, the jeepney ride. It all comes back to me just as when my family left the motherland. Many sentences by Realuyo are even more memorable that they will remain forever engraved within me. They transcend the Flipino culture. I highly recommend this book."
5,You're a Hero!,"My friends and I have read much about Sir Realuyo since he came back to the Philippines. All the major newspapers here have covered him. As a writer myself, I am very proud of his accomplishments. His novel, The Umbrella Country is no easy feat. It has been very controversial here because it is the very first novel written in English that covered issues we only see in movies such as domestic violence, homosexuality and rape. Because of this novel, I consider Sir Realuyo a groundbreaker. He has opened literature to a new generation of writers. I really enjoyed reading the novel, and I hope to see more works from him in the future. Welcome to the Philippines. Don't forget that there are many of us who admire and respect you."
1,Multiculturalism at its worst!,"When universities and colleges are throwing out Shakespeare, Dickens, Hemingway, and even Tolstoy to replace the classics with such poorly written novels like The Umbrella Country, we know the country has gone too far. The dramatic episodes in Realuyo's book wade in the seas of melodrama which can explain its melodramatic effect on its readers. One has not seen such sentimental drivel leaking from the pages of a book since Cotulla's apology Desdemona. To see what makes Multicultural writing so great, one must read Rushdie, Fuentes, Ishiguro. The Umbrella Country holds no water."
1,Overrated! Boring,"After finishing the whole book, I was left literally in wonder why this book ever received the reviews it has been receiving. It is one of the most boring books I have ever read. The characters are not well fleshed out (surprisingly the author admits to this) and the narrator is not even believable (he is so lyrical when is just so young). I could not really understand why there is so much rave reviews on this piece. The themes of the novel are already passé for Filipino books. Daddy Groovie wanting to go to America (ah, give me a break, this theme has been explored better by better authors) and the likes. One of the good points though is that the author has a sensitivity to gay issues. Overall, if you are wasting money, you might as well buy this book. One of the nicest uses of it is for motivating sleep."
2,Disappointing....,"I was so excited to read this book when I found it. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.The novel was very disappointing. At first, I laughed at how the characters reminded me so much of my family & most other Filipino families even here in the States. As I finished chapter after chapter, I became bored with the style of writing.The writer didn't exactly get me to feel sympathy for the characters. Many times, I wasn't sure where the writer was trying to go with the story. There was, if possible, TOO MUCH left to the reader's imagination--too many unanswered questions. I feel the novel was poorly written, which is unfortunate because the story the writer so desperately tried to write can be a good one!"
1,Bad Writing by a Boring Writer,"There is one saving grace to this first novel by this neophyte writer, it is a quick read. One has no sympathy for any of the one-dimentional characters so the reader's empathy never gets established. Sentence construction is very awkward, a sure sign that English may not be the author's true mettle. Not worth the couple of hours I spent on the book."
5,Immensely Powerful!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. No wonder it's getting a lot of glowing ""talk"" in the media here in Manila. These are rarely written about stories in Filipino novels. I'm glad Realuyo was brave enough to bring them forth. What makes it so special is that it portrays the filipino heart so wonderfully and realistically. I'm looking forward to reading more of his work. Salamat!"
1,A boring book,"After finishing the whole book, I was left literally in wonder why this book ever received the reviews it has been receiving. It is one of the most boring books I have ever read. The characters are not well fleshed out (surprisingly the author admits to this) and the narrator is not even believable (he is so lyrical when is just so young). I could not really understand why there is so much rave reviews on this piece. The themes of the novel are already passé for Filipino books.

One of the good points though is that the author has a sensitivity to gay issues. Overall, if you are wasting money, you might as well buy this book. One of the nicest uses of it is for motivating sleep."
4,Very good story!!,The story was very good. I could very easily see it become a novel. Jodi Thomas wrote it so well but I wish she would have separated Bethanie and Mariah's stories into two books. I would have loved to see Mariah and Dusty have their own book. It is definitely worth the read.
1,Bad,Bad. Bad. Bad. D rated softcore porno with horrible acting. I usually like dumb stuff and figured this would be funny. It wasn't.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I love to laugh. I thought a movie this ridiculous would bring a lot of laughter. However, it did not. It was the worst and dumbest movie I've ever seen. After watching it, I took it out of the DVD player and put it directly into the garbage can."
1,Why does this exist?,This 'movie' does not even qualify for awful. There is not even one single line of dialog that is at the entry level of acting school. I could excuse the horrible plot and incredibly bad effects as funny if the cast even had one teeny little bit of talent.This is a disaster on disc that runs far longer than anything this dreadful should ever be endured. If it were a 2 minute Youtube video it might have been excusable.I forced myself to watch the entire piece just so I could write my first Amazon review. That is the measure of how much it reviled me.Never in my life have I seen such a possibly funny idea done so badly.
1,This is a play?,"In all honesty, Pablo Picasso should have stuck to painting pictures. In my opinion, Four Little Girls is not a play. It has no plot, no defined beginning middle or end and scenes which have virtually nothing to do with each other. The characters are indistinguishable from one another, making it a difficult play to visualise, and the characters are prone to random violent acts which have no relation to their characters. Perhaps Picasso should have written poetry instead. I don't believe that this play has ever even been performed. The only redeeming quality that this play has, is that it is great for creating movement based drama. There is a section of the play which relates to any theme you can come up with, and the text can be edited, mixed and matched or simply used as a jumping off point in creating good movement theatre."
1,Too good to be true,"""Too good to be true"" were my first thoughts when I saw this item arrive on the market. At last the original albums by Carmen were being released by Universal on CD. How many would follow?Yesterday I received my copy. Very nice design, very collectable. But the music? Needle-drop! It is a vinyl copy and not a very best one either. A noisy record has been used!I bought this CD through a friend in Japan, so the costs were not too high. I could imagine anyone buying this for the price listed here would really blow his top. So be warned!"
3,"good, Two in one","This is a very good product for having a palm with a camera. I found that this is not the replacement of traditional digital cameras, thought its good to have for the parties, conferences, meetings!"
1,Don't be confused like me.,"If you are limited in your Palm expertise, then don't be confused like me. I assumed since this camera was for the Palm 100 series that it would connect to a Palm m130. It does not. The units have different pin connection systems and there are no adapters that I could find. Otherwise the unit appeared neat, though I did not get to use it."
3,It doesn't work with Palm m105,"I read information in Kodak's page. They say PalmPix for m100 is compatible with Palm m105. I bought a PalmPix for my Palm m105, but it didn't work. Then I tested it in a friend's Palm m100 and it worked."
1,False advertisement,Ordered this DVD 2 pack for my daughter..imagine my anger when it gets delivered and the 2 DVDs I ordered and paid for is really only one. All we got was New York Minute..never received When in Rome. I just love being ripped off
1,Oil was rancid and bitter,"We had been using the oil for a couple months without really paying attention to the taste. This past weekend we held an olive oil tasting at our home to try some new olive oils from Greece. During the blind tasting there was one oil that everyone said was awful. At the end of the tasting we realized it was the Colavita.I suppose we could have had a bad bottle, but based on this experience we plan on avoiding this brand in the feature."
3,Not your typical Aurora Product,"We love all the Aurora products. The Jungle set, Pet set, and Farm set. However, this one has been a disappointment. Not all of the figures work, and if the pirates or monkey do, they may not for very long.After a return via Amazon and still no improvement we settled. Our son is not as interested in this set as the other for that reason more than likely."
4,you gotta hear this!,"The Commitments is an amazing film and soundtrack. It follows a motley, unlikely group of young people in Dublin during the ""troubles"" (look this up, for those of you too young to know the history) who form a band. Their leader is enamored by Wilson Puckett (yeah, download his stuff too), and attempts to form this amazing band that does covers of classic and some unknown old Motown tunes. It's amazing -- the talent is incredible (where ARE these people today?!) and it sucks you in. Well worth the 10 bucks."
3,Sterilized Soul,"Great film, worthy of praise on many different levels including the musical performances. The ""soundtrack"" has been processed. Voices have been run through clippers, and the music re-mastered. It's a sad little example of what corporate suits think soul should sound like in order to sell more copies. Tatoo your soul and buy the originals."
2,Songs Have Been Remixed,"The songs on this CD are not actually taken unaltered from the soundtrack. They have been remixed, most notably by the addition of an electronic keyboard. For whatever reason, the voices lack the ""punch"" that makes the movie soundtrack so good. Together, these differences make the whole CD a very ""ho-hum"" experience."
5,Improved on originals.,Much better than original artist recordings (obviously with change in tech)if you like the music style but prefer a quality recording to listen to.
5,A MUST-BUY . . . ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOVED THE MOVIE,"If you saw and loved the music in the movie The Commitments, then I urge you now to buy this CD. The songs are played exactly as you heard them in the movie, which is a good thing, because we all know that those Dubliners played those songs with Irish enthusiasm! If memories of the movie start coming back while you're listening to this CD, you know why. It was THAT good. And so is this CD. Nuff said."
3,too small,"i didnt give 5 stars cuz the are alot smaller than they appear in the advertisement pics,they also seem very weak,i suppose they would be good for smsll satellite speakers"
3,Too modern for me,"The Bront Project: A Novel of Passion, Desire, and Good PRVandever certainly knows a lot about Charlotte Bronte, her family and her life -- so I suspect the Bronte scholar part is somewhat autobiographical. Once I got into it, this brief story kept my interest, but it is ultimately disappointing. The modern sensibility of young people searching for happiness but unable to love or commit to anything annoys the heck out of me. There is nothing wrong with loving and being loved, with settling down and going deep with someone. It's life's greatest adventure, and it's trivialized here into silliness. This will certainly find its way to being a movie -- it's very visual, and it's just as dissatisfying as most modern movies are."
1,Not worth buying!,"I have other ""A Day in the Life of..."" books, and have enjoyed the unique photos. However, to say that this one fell short of my expectations is an understatement. To make a beautiful photo book of Hawaii should be an easy task. How the photographers managed to fill this book with pictures that don't capture any of Hawaii's beauty is beyond me. If I knew nothing of Hawaii and saw this book, I would have no desire to go there. I found the images to be boring, colorless, lifeless and, dare I say it? - unattractive. If these people had been hired to make a brochure to encourage people to come to Hawaii, they would have been fired. This is by far the worst ""A Day in the Life of..."" book that I have seen. It is so bad that I am unwilling to keep it, and will be donating it to my local library ( people will at least be able to preview it before checking it out, and will not have paid money for it if they are disappointed)."
1,A WASTE of money,"I bought this thinking that perhaps I could make the switch to something that was more Earth friendly than your run-of-the-mill petroleum based cleaning products...BOY, was I wrong! Like the other reviewers, I also had a film on everything. It was embarrassing! It looked like we simply licked our dishes after using them and put them back in the cupboard. In addition to that, about halfway through the box, the grains caked up and stuck together making it extremely difficult to get any soap out!!!"
1,Destroyed my silverware and glasses,"Watch out! We tried this product in an effort to be more environmentally friendly. Instead, we destroyed our SS flatware and glasses. The soap etched the glasses and changed the finish on our stainless steel flatware from shiny to dull. It looks like they have a film on them, but instead they are permanently etched to a dull finish. I am hoping that I can bring back the shine to the flatware with some metal polish, but I am afraid that the glasses are a total loss. Be careful when you try this product not to use your favorite items."
1,Terrible product,This dish detergent doesn't clean my dishes at all and leaves a TERRIBLE film on EVERYTHING!!!!! After only two uses it was starting to pit my stainless steel utensils...
1,Jaws,What a horrible product. Stay away from this one as it doesn't clean anything. Tried using some to clean my tires they looked worse than before I started. As for cleaning dishes this stuff sucks. I had to get a box of regular dishwasher detergent and run the dishes twice just to get them clean. $50 down the drain because I had to throw the stuff out absolutely NO GOOD.
1,Don't Buy,"After trying to identify the wet-dog smell in my kitchen, I sorted through the dishwasher full of ""clean"" (food-bit covered, cloudy) dishes and realized it was this dish detergent. Terrible. Wish it worked; Great concept, nice packaging, but does not deliver on any level."
1,Horrible - A waste of money!!!,"Don't buy this stuff if it's the last dishwasher detergent on earth! Planet Inc. should be ashamed of themselves for selling such an awful product. It wouldn't clean, wouldn't dissolve (regardless of the water temperature), and although I attempted to use it up for other cleaning jobs (kind of like a scouring powder), it did nothing but make a mess."
1,Had to throw out some glassware,Don't buy it. Not only does it not clean but it leaves a film on glassware that is nearly impossible to remove. Wound up throwing some away.
1,Doesn't work.,"Wonderful company values. Unfortunately the product left a gray film on my dishes.Not ok. My heart is with them, but there doesn't seem to be an effective alternative to the nasty stuff."
4,Planet Makes Good Enviromentaly Friendley Products That Work,"I have used several planet products and have always been happy with the results and they are available at stores, not just online. If you are looking for a dishwasher detergant that is better for the enviroment, this a good choice. The detergent is 100% biodegradable and phosphate free. It is not dyed or scented, so there is no excess chemicals going into your dishwasher that just have to be washed off anyway. I rated it at four stars instead of five because I just can't love a dishwashing soap."
4,Awsome,"If you like hunting games then this game is for you!Its not just a 1st person shooter where you kill dinos left and right, you have to do some work.The down sides of this game are you run super slow and the birds are so loud you cant hear yourself think.BUT,overall this is a very fun game that will make you want more!!!!!!!"
2,Not what I ordered,This is an OK briefcase. But the one you receive after ordering it may NOT be the model depicted. The model represented on Amazon is the 'Bucket Boss 06092 EA01 Pro Contractors Briefcase' with the clear map pocket. The model I received was the 'Bucket Boss Classic 06092 (no EA01) Pro Contractors Briefcase' which isn't as nice -- it doesn't include the map pocket. After waiting weeks for delivery -- NOT satisfied.
5,Great album by the greatest pianist!! Mr. Cavallaro rocks!!!,"I bought this in Japan and I loved it!Mr. Cavallaro's music is elegant, melodic, creative and not-as-sacarine-as-Liberace. Cavallaro is the true piano man!This album rocks with rhythm and it seems to be conceived as a small jazz session where the small group (piano, drums, guitar and bass) went through a few standards.Mr. Cavallaro was surely the greatest of his era.This cd comes in a cardboard sleeve that recreates the original LP sleeve. A nice collector's item with timeless material. Sound quality is fine. A fine cd to have and treasure!"
2,"Love David Friedman, eh on this cd","While David's songs speak to an open-hearted audience and are truly moving, the songs on this CD are somehow homogenized with a synthesizer, making them all sound alike. I would have like better voicing on these songs."
2,WARNING! YOU CANNOT PUT THESE IN THE DISHWASHER!,"You'll wash the colors off. Otherwise, they're lovely, very sturdy and big. Little heavy, but very pretty. The dishwasher issue was a non-starter for me. I returned them."
2,Not as good as expected...,"While I totally love Heather Graham, and this series inparticular, there was something missing in this book. I thought she could have explored Julian and Rhiannon's relationship better. It sort of felt like the book was written because she had to put something in with Julian to continue the series. I just think it could have been way better. There were parts of this book that explained a few things from other books in the series for me (I didn't manage to read them in order of course!) , it still did not draw me in the way that Rebel and Triumph, and basically the rest of the series, did. I do however love the way she describes the scenes as if you were there. She is probably one of the best authors regarding Civil War Romance. Just not this particular book."
2,not as good as the others,"i read every single book in the mackenzie family series and i didn't think that this one was as good as the others. i thought both rebel and surrender were great. and that runaway and captive were just fine, but glory didn't live up to the other books. i hope that heather graham comes out with another book in the series so i can see how the rest of the family fares during the war. and i hope that that book is much better that this one was."
4,Hope there is more,The book was well written the story of Julian and Rhiannon was exciting. I felt a little disappointed when nothing more was mentioned about Brent and Mary also Sydney and Jesse. I hope there will be another story written esp. about Brent.
3,"Good, but not what I was waiting a year to read.","I have enjoyed the four previous books in the series of the McKenzie family. I couldn't wait to read this, having read the others numerous times. However, I was left unfulfilled by ""Glory"". It was nice to read more about the family, but it just didn't have the ""feel"" of the previous books."
5,Great but it needs a sequel,"I have read all of the McKenzie stories and have really loved them. Glory was excellent but it ended too soon. WHat happens to all the McKenzies?? I know there was supposed to be only 5 books to the series, but who lives, who dies- how does the story end at the end of the war? what about Brent and Tia?? What about the girl Sam who was in love with Julien and promised to end up in Florida? THere are many stories left to be told in this saga and I only hope that Ms. Graham intends on continuing the saga."
4,helpful,"I have been meaning to keep a pain journal for a long time, and even more so since starting the disability process, but hated the idea of ""dwelling"" (facing/seeing the issues in b&w)on where I hurt and intensities, didn't know what to write, how to start, excuses, excuses. This journal sets some nice, easy to follow guidelines in the beginning that really help."
1,Ripped Off,"I feel like i was ripped off with this product. Im in the military, and deployed right now, so i had this sent home to my mom, where my car was being kept. The product took forever to get there, and when it finally did, it wasn't even a car cover. It was just a bag! The wording in the title is completly misleading. Maybe it was my fault for not reading the reviews and what not. But i still feel jipped!"
1,Car Cover,"I did not receive a car cover, I received a small bag the size of a grocery bag.Wow what deception and disappointment!!!"
2,Boat cover bag,The way the description was worded made me think I was ordering a Bag style boat cover. It sounded too good to be true. Price was very low. I gambled and lost. It's my fault I could have communicated with the seller and then I would know it's only a small bag for a boat cover. Nice bag though.
1,car cover..,car cover? hell no! this is as small as a purse so how can a car fit in here? do not buy from this seller!
3,hmmm..appearently working for hell is a good thing now,what can i say? the guy works for hell and goes around punishing sinners(hmm i thought that was someone elses job....) well it has a (1) funny part in it so youll watch it again in a couple of months
3,Seduction By Design,"This really is a great concept for a book, but it lacked in the character's personalities. For one, Hailey takes things too seriously and the insecurity bit is stressed way too much. Secondly, any female who lets a man walk all over her like that has major problems. If this were reality, Hailey should be seeking professional help. But like I said, the concept is great but the characters are not. It isn't necessarily a bad read, it just could have been much better."
4,A Seduction Worth Reading About,"Hailey Aston meets the owner of the theme park she works at in the most unusual way. She is told immediately that she will be seduced, whether she wants to be or not. Hailey tries to fight her attraction to Tyler Scott but is unable to.Seduction by Design is a quick, fast-paced read. I was drawn into the story within the first few pages and couldn't quit reading until I finished the last page. The characters are pretty well developed. The storyline is your basic man/woman-don't-like-each-other-then-fall-in-love. The character of Faith really added to the story. It made it more interesting. The character of Ellen did add to the story and gave the reader someone they could dislike. While this isn't a deep meaningful love story, it is a quick read for a rainy day or a day at the beach."
2,"Michelle--College Point, NY","First of all, I would like to say that I usually love Sandra Brown books. But I was totaly disappointed in this book. The story line was too predictible and the heroine was too weak."
1,One of Brown's worst!,"This was the worst Sandra Brown book I have ever heard. Not only were the characters shallow (the kid's temper tantrum was probably the best thing about the book) but the ""love story"" between Tyler and Hailey just made me ill. The characters Hailey, with her paranoia and low self esteem issues (Oh, my sister is so much prettier than me, boo hoo, no one is going to love me, boo hoo), and Tyler, with his boorish behavior and dialogue (something along the lines of him being a naked warrior when they were at the cabin), just wanted to make me hide the book in shame."
2,Recycled Harlequin,"This book was just another recycled Harlequin. It was written in 1993 but republished as a much more expensive hardcover in 2001. The title says it is a ""classic"" romance, probably as a shaded disclaimer to let the reader know that the leading man is a pushy male chauvinist pig. If he displayed this same kind of lecherous behavior in this day and age, he'd be slapped with a sexual harrassment suit."
1,Shlock - poorly written schlock,"I cannot believe that anyone admits to reading this book, much less liking it. Pure supermarket trash. I made it to page 23.I see Amazon is advertising used copies for 1 cent plus postage. That about sums it up."
4,Really enjoyed this book,"Like many of Sandra Brown's romance novels, this was a fairly quick read - one evening for me.Hailey Ashton is a mid-30's career woman with a job in an Tennessee Amusement Park dealing with customer relations. Not a success in the dating department, she compares herself to her prettier, yet troubled sister whom she always bails out of trouble. One particular day in the park, an incident brings Hailey unknowingly in direct dealings with the park owner, Tyler Scott. After meeting, he finds her quite attractive and sets out to seduce her, and tells her flat out of his intentions. What follows is an intense seduction that leaves Hailey confused and in love -- with Tyler Scott, and his young daughter.Another great story by Sandra Brown!"
3,Seduction By Design: Not quite a classic love story....,"Seduction By Design is about a insecure woman who finds love through the owner of the amusement park where she works. I have read most of Sandra Brown's books and this book is not one of my favorites or the best that I have read. Her more current books are more suspenseful with a romance in the plot. Her older novels, such as Seduction By Design have strictly a romance plot. This book is a quick read and entertaining, but is not quite as good as her more current novels. The characters are not well developed as compared to her current novels and as soon as the book begins, it ends."
3,Good Romance,I always enjoy Sandra Brown books. This book is older and you can tell by the language and the technology used in the book. The romance is still there and is very good.
4,Entertaining,"I picked this book up last night before getting ready for bed. It was laying on the table so I just picked it up intending to read it until I finished my tea, four hours later I finished it. Now while I don't love it enough to purchase it, I thought it was a pretty good book. It's kinda cheesy in the outrageous things Tyler, the lead male, says to Hailey. This book was written thirty years ago so of course it's going to be dated with talk of Atari and no mention of cell phones. It's just light summer reading, to be enjoyed but not taken seriously."
2,poorly written,"i have read a great many sandra brown books but this was my least favorite. perhaps this was written at a rime before brown had developed her current writing skills, but the plot and language in this story was quite childish and very nearly pathetic.i am beyond dissapointed that they even bothered to publish something so juvenile."
1,Awful,"I am listening to the audio book. It's short and I listen to it in the car, this is also my first Sandra Brown book. If this is an example of her books OMG....it is awful, it is toooooo much of everything. This book makes me want to never read anything else of hers. I keep listening thinking there will be a real twist at the end that will just wow me. There is no depth to the characters or feeling, to me they are absolutely flat."
2,Seduction by Design,This book is not as good as some of her past books. It seems like she is just using her name and not really coming out with anything great. This book should be in paperback because its alright but not great.
4,Tyler Almost Seduced Me!,"I really liked reading about Hailey and Tyler. I didn't realize that the book was written in the '80's. This is the first time I ever read anything by Ms. Brown and I like her style. The fact that he told her up front that he was attrated to her and he planned to sleep with her was really good. I have to hand it to him, the man sure knows how to get what he wants."
2,a love story a high school girl may appreciate...,"haily ashton seems to be secure with a good head on her shoulders until she meets tyler scott who owns the amusement park where haily is employed. when tyler scott suddenly expresses that he wants haily and plans to get her (for he gets anything he wants), she suddenly becomes terribly insecure and whiney. throughout the story, tyler grows deeper in love (or is it in lust) with haily and though she seems to be feeling the same, she cannot believe that this rich, handsome, powerful man sees in her what he claims. she clearly has no self esteem.the story seems to read as if it were written by a young insecure senior high student who is experiencing puppy love with one of the boys in her class. and so a teenager in high school may appreciate this fantasy. unfortunately i am beyond those years and live in the real world where i know these kinds of relationships only happen in the movies... (or books)"
2,TOO MUCH WHINING!,I THINK THE MAIN FEMALE CHARACTER WHINED WAY TOO MUCH ABOUT EVERYTHING. SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BEING USED AS A BABY SITTER THEN OF COURSE SHE FEELS REALLY INSECURE BECAUSE HER LITTLE SISTER IS PRETTIER THAN HER. BLAH BLAH BLAH!! I DONT THINK HAILEY TRIED TOO HARD TO HELP THE RELATIONSHIP. MAYBE I'M WRONG BUT THAT'S THE IMPRESSION I GOT.READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO READ.
3,"Good for a quick read, but don't invest much time in it!","This story, like many of the older romance novels is about an insecure woman who meets a successful and charming man. He sweeps her off her feet with the same run of the mill bumps in the road that happen in romance.The characters are under developed and the story is anything but unique. I like reading romance with a strong woman who isn't a doormat. So, if you are looking for a book to make you laugh, cry and cheer for the characters...my advice, choose a different one."
3,Cute,I found this story to be cute. The sexy romance was really quite hot as well. I enjoyed it very much.
1,Othello,"Buy this book online and never received, Very disappoint for the service, I will be think twice before buy anything from this side again."
3,Fabulous Forever Stretch and Tone by Mirabai Holland,"I would have given this DVD 5 stars for exercise. But the music is so horrible and so loud, that if you wish to listen what Miss Mirabai is saying, you have to turn the volume up, which for me (Fibromyalgia sufferer) is impossible.I did not wish to be on very loud, unpleasant concert, but enjoy my exercising."
4,Great item!,"This product works great and did the job. If you're planning on buying this, make sure you do the research prior to ordering."
5,Beautiful!,"The Kodachrome family is the most beautiful film ever made. As a professional photographer (now retired, but still using my favorite film of all time) I was dumbfounded when I heard it was being discontinued. A tradgedy! I hope they consider bringing it back as the cost is now prohibitive."
5,Best hair brushes ever,"I have used Mason Pearson hair brushes (the hair brushes of the Queen...England, of course) and have loved them. I have had a detangler for 20 years and purse size mixture for about the same time. Just got the bigger size Mixture bristle/nylon as it seems to work better in straightening my hair after washing. You will never regret buying one of these."
4,Supreme funkiness,"This is the second album from Lionrock and it is just as good as the first. Complete with funky, rythmic beats and great inner fusion of jazz and techno. There are also a few songs that bring more of those soft, poetic, yet charged lyrics that were so prevelent in the first album. If you crave a hard, funky beat and good, original music, then look no further."
3,"Nice picture, but you have to mix paint","My daughter (age 5) painted this picture. It was a bit too challenging for her, which is consistent with the recommended age listed on the box.The paints were fine quality, not lumpy or thin, and the art board was also nice.My problem with this product was that you had to mix many of the colors. My recollection is that there were 8 paints that combined to about 14 colors."
5,Great Replica,For a while I have been thinking about getting a Force FX Lightsaber. I eventually saved up enough money to get one and I spent a few weeks looking at all the different lightsabers. I eventually chose this one and I am glad I did! The lightsaber has a beautiful glow to it and it looks incredibly realistic when lit up (It lights up the whole room!). This lightsaber is however very delicate and will scratch fairly easily. As long as you don't use it for any serious fighting it should be fine. I love this lightsaber and so will you!
3,Bait and Switch ( Not Master Replicas ),"I bought this lightsaber because I needed a Luke episode VI to complete my collection, The only problem is they adverised it as Master Replicas. They charged me Master Replicas price but when I opened the box it was a Hasbro. The only good thing was it came in a secondary box to protect it during shipping and no shipping labels placed on collectible box. Should have been $100 cheaper, buyer beware !"
4,Interesting Concepts for Unidentified Submersible Objects,"Ivan Sanderson presents some great alternative concepts and answers to some old questions regarding UFO's and USO's. Even though many of his documented and undocumented cases referenced in the book are somewhat vague and unproven, the basic questions of the existence of either extraterrestials or ""others"" living underwater is a mind provoking thought. Is it possible that an ancient earth lifeform highly superior to ""humans"" existed long before us, and occupies the underwater domain. I used concepts from this book in my book, ""The Nightmare Trilogy"", in the first story ""Aliens?"", where I suggest the aliens are not what they seem, but have been here all along. I certainly recommend the book for anyone seeking thought provoking material to explain some of the documented UFO/USO cases that have been unexplained."
4,Food for thought,"""Invisible Residents-the reality of underwater UFOs"" is a well thought-out, well-researched book on the possibility of resident aliens living in the deepest, most inaccessible rears of our oceans. Well documented, with many pictures this is an easy read with lots of good information for those doing their own UFO investigations. Highly recommended."
4,Great book,"Gets you thinking, lots of UFO encounters and great theories. Even as old as the book is it still connects with modern UFO skeptics."
3,Paata Charashvili,"This book is very interesting. In this book mensioned lots of aspects in wide way. THere is also very specific theories about UAO, UFO, etc. Anyway I really like this book and wishing good luck to the author.Paata"
3,Small & Cheap looking,My daughter will be getting this (along with many other gifts) for Christmas. It is smaller and cheaper looking than I had expected - I doubt it'll last too long.
2,Fell apart,"In my opinion, well made boots should last at least a year. I was very pleased with my first pair of Laredo boots but this model, for whatever reason is inferior. I think that these boots look nice and may be well suited to infrequent use. However, I wear my boots every day and these began to fall apart immediately. The first thing to go is the shiny metal bits. Then you will notice there is a cord that follows the side seams of the boot. That cord becomes unsheathed and frays out in an ugly white mess. And finally the soles wear away leaving bunches of black thread popping out at all angles around the foot. Now I am ashamed to wear them."
4,Very good,"Simply the song ""Late Night Grand Hotel"". It's one of the best songs I have ever heard. It's so true and honest and shockingly well observed. Thank you Nanci."
4,"Affective, Powerful","Reading Steptoe's ""Uncle's South China Blue Sea"" is like watching a graphic war movie, a true marker of his ability. In a few pages of poetry, I saw exotic landscapes, tangible pain, a past so unforgetable that it's managed to follow all those involved into the present, a scarred people, and a generation forever changed. A Worthwhile Read!"
3,Great when it's cloudy,"Kodak EliteChrome 100 provides extra saturated colours. This results in warmer colour tones in cloudy weather. However, the result is too unrealistic under strong sunshine, where the natural colours become over-saturated and significantly deformed. In this case, other films like Velvia return a much more realistic result, and are therefore well worth the extra money."
5,animal caregiver,"yeah it is technical..has to be if you have a dog,cat horse etc. All the body parts are there..."
3,Good for introduction,"This textbook is pretty good information for those who are studying anatomy and physiology for the first time. However, it lacks the development of information at times for the functions I and descriptions of bones. Also, if you are a graphic learner, this book falls behind in terms of pictures. I found that I really needed to absorb what was observed in the lab to connect it with the information in this book.Overall, it's a good start to learning the basics of anatomy and physiology."
1,A lousy textbook,"I got this book for Vet A&P class, and I'm switching to a human anatomy book for next term. This book is printed in monochromatic blue, with lousy diagrams and scant information (24 pages dedicated to the skeletal system, and a whopping 14 for the muscular system!) In short, this is the most uninviting textbook I've ever opened, and it's been completely useless to me. A total waste of 50 bucks."
5,Awesome reference book!,Recently I started studying to get my Vet Tech certification. This was one of the text books for the Physiology class. It is an awesome book. It goes into enough detail to give a good understanding of physiological processes. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about veterinary physiology. Five paws up rating all the way!
5,Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears,"Wonderful adaptations of 4 Caldecott winning Multicultural books. ""Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters"" is a heart-warming story of two beautiful daughters, tested unknowingly, to reveal who is worthy to marry the King. The magnificent artwork and rich musical score help to make this a story for all to remember. ""Why Mosq Buzz in People's Ears"", narrated in the deep voice of James Earl Jones, is a traditional African tale portraying a comic chain of mishaps from Mosquito to Iguana - A folktale from Africa ""A Story-A Story"" tells the journey of Anansi, the Spider man. In ""The Village of Round and Square Houses"", a young girl from West Africa tells how men came to live in square houses, and women in round."
5,Amazing,"Gushi Shinyu is in amazing condition for a man of his age and is an amazing martial artist. His kata are crisp and powerful, vintage Uechi-ryu/Pangainoon. This video is well worth adding to any martial artist's library."
2,An Average Ballet Class,"Bryony's ballet class is quite average. For starters, there is only one participant: Bryony. For seconds, there are a lot of slow motion demonstrations and scenic sequences that have little to do with ballet class A third compaint is that Bryony goes through all the barre work without really breaking down and teaching the individual exercises. There is little nomenclature and explanation in this video. An intermediate student might know what's happening, but this video would tend to lose the beginning student taking his or her ""first steps."" Finally, I think Bryony rushes too quickly into the more complex exersises, losing all but the more informed student of ballet. If you want to see a professional work at the barre, get this video. If you are a beginner, find a less advanced and more basic tape."
4,I Liked This Video,"This is one of my favorite ballet videos.It would probably be best appreciated in combination with a basic instructional video. Ms. Brind does not go into a detailed explanation of each step and some of what she does would be beyond the ability of a beginner. She comments on and demonstrates the fundamentals but communicates primarily through her movements.She shows the connection between the various phases of ballet training; warm up, barre and floor, to preparation for a role. In Ms. Brind's case, each phase transcends exercise and becomes a dance, and one has the inspiration of seeing the basic movements performed with the feeling and grace of a classical ballerina."
4,It just WORKS,First of I have purchased several 5-HTP product and none of them worked like this one. It's a perfect supplement with your daily stressful life and it greatly improves you mood gives better outlook in life.
5,great value,I give my son 2 of these 2 times a day to help with his mood and depression. He's a 14 yr old typical teen who has had it a bit rough but it's getting better.
2,mixed feelings about,"i took this for only 3 days. took one tablet in the morning. i didn't think about eating. that was good. but i had the most debillitating headaches i've EVER experienced. so i did some reading. severe headaches was one of the side effects of this. reviews were mixed as i read more and more. i know different things react differently, but i had to stop. i can't afford to lay on the couch because of the severity of the headaches.but, that's just me..."
2,Cheap but bad taste,"I've taken a bunch of different brands of HTP. Most of them taste mildly earthy and plant-like. This one tastes chemically and gross. You would think that you wouldn't need to worry about the taste of a pill but I guess it's technically the smell that's bad because all you can truly taste is the capsule coating. That being said, the pennies you save by buying primaforce htp is only worth it if you don't value your personal experience. Splurge a few pennies so you don't take a hundred crappy-tasting pills. For the record, I finished the bottle, but I will never buy this brand again."
2,Primaforce 5 HTP,"My internist recommended this to me because I have Hashimoto disease/hypothyroidism and he thought this could help me with fighting weight gain related to the disease - WRONG. I am using a prescription that primarily addresses my T-4 level but my T-3 level remains low (and he doesn't want to prescribe a med specifically for it, it's complicated) and that needs to be elevated to up my metabolism to stimulate weight loss. I used it for more than a month and saw no change so would never use it again."
5,MUCH NEEDED FOR THE HARD TO RELAX,"I TAKE ONE CAP FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE BED AND I CAN FEEL IT SMOOTHING ME OUT FOR SLEEP.CONVERSELY, I CAN TAKE ONE DURING ACTIVE HOURS TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF; BEFORE THE SHOOTING RANGE OR SPEAKING PRESENTATIONS.-GOOD PRODUCT."
5,RIGHT ON TIME!,"DONNIE, I LOVED YOUR BOOK. IT WAS ON TIME. I REALLY NEEDED YOUR BOOK. I LOVED IT BECAUSE IT MINISTERED TO MY HEART. AND THAT SONG YOU WROTE, OH MY GOD! THAT REALLY TOUCHED ME. I THINK YOU SHOULD TITLE IT ""LETTING GO""! I THOUGHT YOUR BOOK WAS VERY INSPIRATIONAL AND MOTIVATIONAL. CONTINUE TO MINISTER TO GOD'S PEOPLE. BE ENCOURAGED AND BLESSED. LOVE YA!"
5,UNCOVERING DIFFERENT TRUTHS OF THE CHURCH,"Eternal Victim / Eternal Victor is an awesome book.. I'm in the military and i had duty the night i began reading it.. I ended up reading it all before i got off work.. Through his book, he ministered to my heart.. The fact of the matter is that he spoke the truth.. He dwelled on all things that happen in our every day lives.. I was very impressed by this book, and i hope to read all of his other books.. Once again, i recommend this book for anyone and everyone.."
3,maybe-maybe not,This device is a beautiful piece of technology but I cant get it to burn cd's I sent it back to the distributor they checked it out and everything was ok - its great for watching dvd's on the computer. the software that is included with the device has to be upgraded to burn cd's!! oh well it looks nice next to the computer.
3,Good DVD burning. Cannot burn CDRs successfully,For some reason all attempt to burn regular audio CDs fail and ruin the media. Otherwise works well with all DVD media.
5,Does the Job Right,"This DVD Burner does the job right, with fast burning and easy setup, I had my movies burning within a few minutes to unpacking it from the box. The delivery of the DVD Burner was very quick. Defiantly a best buy here, I know from experience that there are some burners out there that do not work or cannot burn quickly, but for this one; it does the job great! Def. a good buy."
3,Not as sweet as I expected,"I expected this to have more sugar on/in it. The java/mocha flavor overwhelms the cinnamon flavor, and the sticks themselves seem to have no sugar sprinkled or added to it.I would not order these again."
3,Nice,The produce I ordered shipped on time and was I good condition when it got here. Everything went smoothly and I would definitely buy here again.
3,"Good film, horrible price!","I couldn't believe this price... and it's ""clearance""?! Shop around for 5 minutes and you'll find it easily for under $4."
4,very good for beginners,"I'm in a photography class at my school, and I find that this film is very good for it. Most of the things I have to photograph must be outside, so this film is very good for the outdoors. For indoors with this film, you need bright lights. Normal light usually doesn't do the trick, and flashes can flatten the image, so I highly recommend getting some extra lamps, just for photography purchases. But anyways...good film for beginners, or someone who develops their own film."
1,dull and available,"This item can be purchased at the local Wal-Mart for less. While you are shopping, you might want to also buy a knife sharpener, because you will need one. It would not cut tomatoes without extreme care. I did not contact the seller - -what can they do except send me another dull knife. I sharpened it myself and now it is a good knife, but the ""grooves"" in the blade that are supposed to keep cut slices from sticking do not do their job. It is no different than a knife without the grooves. It is very well balanced and heavy enough to cut anything in the kitchen. The handle and finger guard are excellant."
4,"Works, nice knife for cheap","I sharpened this knife on my Tormek and it took a very nice edge. It was so sharp that it took a third of my finger nail clean off...still growing it back. I bought it because it was a cheap way to obtain this style of knife and it seems to work fine. Start with this knife before spending hundreds of dollars on a ""real"" Santoku. This may be all you need."
3,Not as good as the other Centurion knives,"In general, I like the Centurion line of knives. I own an 8"" chef, 8"" slicer, 5"" utility and 3.5"" parer. I use them daily and am very satisfied. They're attractive, well-balanced, sharp, and hold their edge well.However, their Santoku knife wasn't nearly as sharp out of the box and, despite considerable effort, I couldn't get it sharp enough to suit me. I ended up giving it away. I use my chefs knife for my heavy chopping and prep work. It does a fine job."
1,been waiting,"ordered this item on 12/14/011 as a christmas gift for my son. ordered thru amazon.com, billed to me, sent to my daughter's address where we would be spending the holidays. to date, the item has yet to be received - even though my charge account has been billed and the item paid for."
3,Daskin supples legging,The quality is cheap. The previous ones that they used to make were definitely better material. They even run bigger...Dissatisfied with the product.
2,Not the Greatest,"I like the sucking in quality of these, but they're certainly not as comfortable as other pairs of leggings. Also, I've had them for 10 months and they have 2 holes in them already. Not cool. I won't be repurchasing."
1,Saggy Baggy,"I have been wearing the 1562 Danskin legging for 15 years. . . .Since the company was sold, the quality of the fabric being used is so VERY different . After wearing these tights for a couple hours the begin to sag . .the fabric is very stretchy . .I have to keep pulling them up . These are worse than the ones sold on the Danskin website., which are not great. After the company was sold I found several of the good quality leggings on e-bay . .I wear leggings most every day. . . with boots in the winter, running shoes or my Camper Peu's in the summer. . . so I am really disappointed in the World of Danskin leggings right now"
5,this is just what I wanted,these are a great addition to the other ones I have bought. Each style has it's own character and use. I love them and will buy more for all my uses.
3,Uneven Quality,"Danskin used to wear like iron and look brand new for years. Not so much any more. Also, one pair I bought wasn't even sewn together! I put them on and there were foot-long gaps in the seams. Ugh."
4,UNTOLD HISTORY,"THE BOOK ""TRAGIC MOUNTAINS"" GIVES ME AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE HISTORY IN THE PAST. ALSO, A REASON WHY HMONG WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE SHADOWS BECAUSE THEY HAD MADE LOAS A HISTORY BY JOINED WITH THE AMERICANS TO FOUGHT AGANIST COMMUNIST. IT INSPIRED ME IN MANY WAYS WHICH I CAN NOT EXPLAIN BUT WITH TEARS AND FEARS. NOW THAT THE HISTORY IS TOLD IN THE BOOK ""TRAGIC MOUNTAINS,"" I FELT THAT IT IS MY DESTINATION TO MAKE A DIFFERANCE IN AMERICA. ""BY MAKING A DIFFERANCE IN AMERICA, IT WILL BECAME PART OF OUR HISTORY,"" SAID NELSON NAGAI."
1,the truth? not really...,"this book has some truth...but woopti doo... anyone can research...but until you were actually there...you'll never know.If you are Hmong and you read hamiltons book and you beleive all that is said, you need help....HA just kidding... but you do need to go to a HMONG SOURCE, someone that was there, fighting in the war, and leading the Hmong people to freedom, to find out what really happened, not rely on someone who wants to make a buck off our culture. Please do not think i'm trying to sound better than anyone, all i'm saying is that the world deserves to know the truth about the Hmongs and how MAJORLY significant we were to the ""war"". We have been sworn in as an ethnic group recently, but now we also need to map the Hmong into American History for all to learn about. This is not about Hmong pride, this is about education...Again, this book has some truth... but...stay tuned and the truth will soon be out."
3,Engaging,"As will be established by many other reviewers, there ARE some significant points of contention, particularly regarding the Yellow Rain element of the book and the occasional heavy-handed romanticizing of the Hmong. But these are not enough to totally undermine the value of the book.By and large, it really tells a deeply engaging story about the Hmong and should be considered one of the essential reads on the matter.Considering the large lack of material on the Hmong prior to this book, it is an important step.One might want to compare it to Backfire/Shooting At the Moon by Warner in particular, or even The Ravens / Air America by Robbins. Another good text to have on hand is Sky Is Falling by Morrisson.We should all still be waiting for the great Hmong account of the war in Laos from their own perspective however. That should make fascinating reading."
1,Deceptive Advertising,"Excellent Bar if you are looking for lots of Sugar...the Amazon product information lists the following as the ingrediants: ""Metamyosyn V100 Protein Blend, Corn Syrup, Brown Rice Syrup, Coated Chocolate Chips ..."" however the package lists ""Corn Syrup"" as the first ingrediant.The bar has the same sugar content as a can of soda or a dessert (which might be ok if it actually tasted good). The irony is that it would actually taste a lot better if it wasn't sooooo sweet..."
2,Disappointed,"I loved the movie and the haunting twangy guitar music of Hans Zimmer & co, but the CD has only a few bars of this in ""Thunderbird"", at the beginning. This is such a shame as this could have been a monster hit in its own right if it had been developed and recorded seperately. Huge mistake by MCA."
1,the best thing that's missing,"The only song that I loved was the song that got played at the end when they drove off the cliff. I cry everytime I see that part and with that beautiful choir score in the background makes me cry even harder. They made a huge mistake in not included it, I think the soundtrack would have been much better with it."
2,The most important is missing !!! D- !!!,"I just bought this soundtrack and was extremely disappointed when I listened to it. The most important is missing: the original motion score picture !!! Only ""thunderbird"" cheered me up, the last song by Hans Zimmer. Why didn't MCA release the motion score picture ? Unforgivable mistake ! D- deserved !!!Nick Atlanta, GA"
1,Save your money!,"When I first heard about this CD I couldn't wait to get it - after I got it, I couldn't listen to it. This CD is just awful. Ron Carter is a fabulous jazz bassist, but he has no business recording Bach and trying to tell us it is something of quality. It is an insult to all the great and aspiring classical bassists who can really play these works. Then, if this recording isn't bad enough - he follows it with another: Ron Carter Meets Bach, which is worse than this one. Shame on Ron Carter and Philips - they should know better than to distribute this garbage. If you're interested in hearing the Bach Cello Suites on the bass, check out the recordings by: Gary Karr, Edgar Meyer, Owen Lee, or Mark Bernat. You will be amazed at how really wonderful a bass can sound."
1,Absolutely App- (Maul) -ing!,"My motives for purchasing this novel were pretty straight forward - I like Darth Maul. I had hoped this novel would expand on the mystique of this powerful Sith apprentice. However I was rather dissapointed. The novel was flat and not very exciting to read. The book is littered with way too many Star Wars clichés, references to monsters by name only (do I need to buy the Star Wars encyclopedia to find out which species the author is referring to?) and the general story line is rather weak. Perhaps this novel was somewhat of a let down because it is set prior to the events in the film Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace. You know that Maul's exploits will not be unearthed by the Jedi, you know the plans for the blockade will not be revealed to the Jedi, and you know that Darth Maul survives in the end! So it's pretty predictable. Perhaps an adventure story not relating to Episode 1 would have been a better option. This novel is about as exciting as frozen Tauntaun dung."
4,"Good, light summer reading for Star Wars fans.","A Jedi Padawan on her first solo assignment. A man who's lost everything that mattered to him, who hopes to escape his current life - or excuse for one - in Coruscant's underworld. Assorted monsters, rogues, and droids. And, cutting a swathe through them (sometimes literally!) - Darth Maul, on a mission for his mysterious master.From those ingredients, author Reaves creates a fast-paced and sometimes intriguing adventure set in a part of the Stars Wars Empire's glittering capital that we never saw in the films. He does an excellent job of blending familiar Lucas-conceived elements with his own original ones, and introduces original characters who fit into the Star Wars universe as if they'd been there all along. He even manages to use Darth Maul (""The Phantom Menace"") as his main character without robbing the evil Sith apprentice of all mystery.Good, light summer reading for Star Wars fans."
3,Scampering around Coruscant,"Light saber action in the underworld! That about sums it up. It was a good, quick fun read."
2,doubt I'll finish this book....,"ok, I've been reading alot of classics lately, and I'm only half into stars wars, I liked the films and all, and I've read a few of the books... I started this one yet I doubt I'll even finish it, as slow as the start of this book is... not to mention the lack of a ablity of the writer... I just want to fall asleep everytime I pick this book up... who knows, I may change my mind if I ever finish the book but somehow I doubt it... word to the wise, don't knock Barbera Humbely's books until you've read this one."
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover...,Don't let the fancy cover art bedazzle you on this one. It was not enjoyable and really went nowhere from start to finish. It doesn't go into any real detail about the history of Darth Maul other than a few short flashbacks (and I do mean short) of events prior to the storyline or even to the movie.Definitely would not recommend to anyone.
2,"Jeez, Reaves, what gives?","I've been a fan of Reaves for a while now, after his work on Warner Bros. Animated Batman series and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm...hell, I've even talked to him on occasion via email, but this book does not live up to what it could've been. his writing style reminds me of Steve Perry (Author of Shadows of the Empire, prob the best SW book outside Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy) but without the whip-smart sequences and dialouge. Admittedly, I admire the downbeat ending, which makes this book a notch more interesting than, say, every ""Kindly southern lawyer helps woman-in-need/homeless child/missonary on the Nile"" book out there. Still, Reaves is partial to FAR superior novelization like his work on Aliens vs Predator: Prey...wait, that was Steve Perry again, sorry..."
3,"starts off good, ultimately disappointing","the first half of the book was pretty good, then it fell apart. cheesy predictable ending. you could tell the author wanted to write a kick@#s story but was constrained due to having to fit in with the star wars timeline/universe.better than the average star wars novel, but the last half of the book (an implausible budding romance, etc.) is just plain ole bad."
3,Entertaining if a bit cheesy,"Overall the book is well written and held my interest from start to finish. But, some of the situations that the characters encounter along the way made me feel that I was reading a D&D novel instead of a Star Wars novel. We get some good insights into life in the underbelly of Coruscant, but no real clues as to why the Jedi are so despised by the Sith. Finally, for one who's already familiar with the events of Episode I, the entire book is read with the fore-knowledge that the Jedi counsel will not receive warning about the impending blockade of Naboo, nor information about the existence of the Sith. In short, we know in advance that the heroes will fail."
2,Pure dreck,"My son has a weakness for this stuff, but I am afraid it's pure unadulterated dreck. I can understand liking the characters, but there are better fantasy vehicles aorund and buying this is just being a sheep."
4,Well written but sad,"I know these people had to die, but couldn't they have been launched into space for a few months or something? I must admit all of Maul's kills are stylish, but the dueling descriptions could be better. The way the heroes sacrifice themselves is ingenious, and the plotlines are well written. The revealing of Maul's homeworld led me to a few conclusions, and the new creatures in the book are awesome. I gave this 4 stars because I hardly ever give anything 5. This is well worth the price and it is a must-read for any episode 1 fan."
5,if death was to have a name it would be DARTH MAUL,WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS BOOK? IF ONE WORD COULD SUM IT UP: AWESOME!!!!! i dont want to give away any of the story so all i can say is that if you have been let down by sw bks in the past..... THIS ONE MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR IT!!!!
3,Almost there,"Was looking for something new about Darth Maul, however what I received were the details accounts of DM's actions already found in the previous book. It was a good read that helped describe DM's view points on his hate of the Jedi and master/apprentice relationship with Darth Sidious (Palpatine)."
5,Very cool book.,"I loved this novel. The description of battles is top notch, and is one of the best chase novels I ever read. What's more, reading about the characters, you really get to feel an empathy for them. Myself, I'd like to read more of the exploits of the droid character. After reading about him in the Medstar Duology, I can't wait for Coruscant Nights, because chances are he'll show up there once more. Very good book, well worth the $7 price tag. The e-book is mediocre at best, but the other book makes up for that."
4,"Darth Maul, we hardly knew thee...","If you are a Darth Maul fan, and long for the day where Sith were more than just creepy old guys, then this is the book for you.It is colorful, exciting, a quick read. Maul is relentless, this book paints him almost as a Michael Myers (of Halloween fame) or a Jason (Friday the 13th): A stalking relentless Menace leaving death and destruction in his path. This is certainly his book.You'll buzz through it and find that you enjoyed yourself."
4,A great example of classic pulp science fiction,"Michael Reaves has done his homework. Not only is he able to slip comfortably into the Star Wars Universe, he also does a very good job at recreating that fast and gritty space opera atmosphere which was the hallmark of the science fiction pulp novel of the fifties and sixties. Michael Reaves may not be Robert Heinlein, but he gets the job done. The story itself continues where ""Cloak of Deception"" by James Luceno leaves off. Only weeks before the blockade of Naboo ( in the Episode I movie ), a leak has been discovered, and Darth Maul has been sent to plug it before the Jedi have a chance to foil the Siths' evil plans....."
5,An incredible thriller set in the Star Wars universe!,"This is easily my favorite Star Wars book to date. It has a completely different feel. This is like one of those simplistic, but great Stephen King novels that you simply can't put down. If you want to get away from all the politics and huge number of characters and planets involved in most Star Wars books and instead take a wild ride as the coolest villain ever made relentlessly and brilliantly hunts his unfortunate group of prey throughout Coruscant than this book is for you. The action is non-stop with lightsabers, blasters, and horrendous creatures lighting up every page. I recommend this not only to fans of Star Wars, but to fans of thrillers in general."
3,Who is this book about anyway?,"Enter Darth Maul, Darth Sidious and a cast of characters you don't know . . . .Hmm, sound interesting. Of course you know that Darth Maul will win Darsha I-5 and Lauren are doomed.Despite this I decided to give this book a try. I was intersested to meet some new characters and see what the author would do with them . . .very little.I was particularly disappointed when Obi-Wan slowly started to become a contributing character in the story line.To add insult to injury Yoda and Qui-Gon make cameos. Their appearances do nothing for the story..."
5,Thrilling,"Unlike most Star Wars book, which take time to build up a scenario and come with an all-together well thought out and fun storyline, this one is a crashcourse into suspense and action.The storyline is simple, yet will leave you on the edge of your seat, dying to see what happens next.-->SPOILER ALERT<--Darth Maul is sent to kill a Neimoidian who has stolen a holocron detailing the Trade Federation's plot to blockade Naboo, and he plans to sell it to an information broker. Maul kills the Neimoidian, though fails to retrieve the holocron, which the broker gets. A young, aspiring Jedi padawan, Darsha Assant gets involved, and both of them are now on the run in Coruscant from Maul, who chases them all throughout the underworld of Coruscant.-->END SPOILER ALERT<--All in all, it was like watching a fast-paced thriller movie, and even at the end, when you think all has been resolved, IT HAS NOT!! BWAHAHAHAHAHHA!!!!"
5,exciting book,A lot of action and excitement. One of the most enjoyable star wars novels I've read. I give it 4.5 stars. something you will read more than once and that pretty much says it all.
3,Tough Row to Hoe,"Envy author Reaves I do not. As this book is a prequel to the famous prequel Star Wars Episode I, there is not much room for suspense. The character of Darth Maul is visually intimidating, but on the printed page he comes off as flat and one-dimensional, and absent a few contrived obstacles placed in his path, it appears that our protagonists don't have much of a future. However, Reaves does create some interesting new characters, especially the droid I-Five, and it's to his credit that he manages to make the story interesting enough under the circumstances. And although his ending was good, as I was reading it I was hoping he might wind up somewhere else, and the most intriguing mystery from this story might be whether the folks at Lucasfilm influenced the story ending by using a Jedi mind trick on the author. Difficult to see, it is...."
2,"I love the character, Darth Maul,","but I was not impressed with this book. Set on Coruscant, Maul is assigned the odious task of hunting down a sniveling neomidian, a Han Solo-esque crook and his droid. Hardly worth his time. The story drags on and on, as Pavin gets lucky break after lucky break, and even a jedi apprentice gets thrown into Maul's path. The story was poorly written, the plot boring, and the characters (even Maul) poorly expanded upon. Get this book only if you are a die-hard Star Wars fan."
5,Picture Perfect!,The quality of this paper is very good and for the price it can't be beat. Its not a super shiny gloss but the photos look very good. I will definitely stack up on more of it. Same quality as all the other name brand photo paper out there.
2,ugh,The wood is starting to split and We have only had this product a few months. Even if you don't put it in the dishwasher and wash by hand. But the actual knife is good
3,"Nice knives, but handles don't match","I like these knives. They are large, hefty and have a sharp, serrated blade.However, the set of four knives that I received consisted of two knives with dark wood handles and two knives with much lighter-colored wood handles. They don't match! This may well be a problem only with the one set I received, I don't know. But it would probably upset most buyers."
3,Good steak knives,"The knives are very much like you'd find in a steakhouse, however, the handles are ""rustic"" I'd have preferred handles that were finished (varnish?). This one gets wet and I try not to let them get soaked."
3,Just Fine,"I'd say these are ""just fine"" -- They're not super well made, and they're not super heavy. The tang does not extend fully through the handle. They're a relatively large size. The blade does not flex.If you're used to the steak knives that you might get at a steakhouse -- the ones that are REALLY heavy and hefty -- these are NOT nearly as heavy as those.All around, a reasonable set of medium quality knives large size steak knives for a reasonable price, suitable for everyday use."
3,BUY THICKER STEAKS,Good steak knives. Would have been a 5 star review but knives do NOT come with a full length tang as advertised. You can see in the picture where the three rivets holding the half tang stop half way down the handle and the tang stops about one half inch past the last rivet. They are not very heavy so the gals can have a go at it without their hands/wrist getting tired holding the knife. HAPPY CUTTING
3,works in a pinch,"I needed a new pair of goggles for riding; since my old ones broke. I thought I save some money buying this. It fit ok, but after awhile it started to bother me a little and it tended to fog up."
2,FOTL 4-Pk Ringer Boxer Brief,"This the second tagless FOTL boxer briefs I've ever owned. The waist is just right maybe 1/4"" largerbut leg ends are perfect hold the best yet around 22-23"". The tagged ones I get at Walmart are near perfect a littl slack in leg ends, but fit perfect in waist & run only around $10.00. These just too pricey & I learned tagless FOTL not same as tagged FOTL. Went & measured Boxer briefs purchased at WalMart in July 2012 & Tagless FOTL Boxer Briefs-1 "" shorter crotch 1/4"" larger waist & 1 1/4"" smaller leg opening. Now I was looking for the smaller leg opening but 1 3/4"" less crotch. Might as well be briefs. I will not get tagless anymore, may just pay $30.00 for Under Armour cotton 9"" inseam. I don't like compression or core but the UA cotton Are by far the best wearinf boxer briefs."
2,unfocused effort that was easily distracted by cultural appropriatIons bedcausea of cinema,"unfocused effort that could and should have spent more time on contemporary films and native actors, both in hollywood and indie films. The over-sexualized and stereotyped roles for native actors frequently reduce them to walking scene dressing are overlooked to explore summer camp a rituals influenced any people with aexposure ti Native reality only through TV abda film It doesn't explore the challenge of getting cast in non-ethnic roles, or the challenge the few a native american actors have and a getting them. Also had a dearth of upcoming NDNa indoor film production."
4,"Great songs but none are full 12"" length...","...if that doesnt matter to you, then this is a very good buy. A great selection of funk songs on 2 CDs."

5,Perfect.,"Tmax 100 is amazing. For black and white film, you would be hard-pressed to find something better in 35mm. Its grain is essentially nonexistent when unpushed, its tonal range is enormous, and it is the clearest film that I have ever worked with. If you get scans made, tell the lab not to correct them, because in my experience they will push the contrast too far. Other than that minor defect, this is possibly the best black and white film out there."
4,"Yes, it's a cozy...why dump on it just because you hate seven sisters schools?","Oh la la la. I went to a school in Virginia which fancied itself a ""seven-sisters-of-the-south."" This mystery is quite true to the genre. If you really can't consider people named ""Pudgie"" as real individuals, then pass on by...but if they seem like human beings to you, then perhaps you should read this. It's kinda fun. Yes, the original frame-up is pretty obvious -- but who hasn't known totally oblivious people, much less cops? Perhaps even oblivious reviewers? Hm.This mystery is totally worth it for the lobotomy scene. If you were on the table slated for a lobotomy, how would you get out of it? Maggie does pretty well. If in doubt, seek refuge at the President's house...once you have managed to get off the table, find something to wear, and escape the hospital. OK, it's not likely in real life. But why the hell do we read this stuff? It's FUN and it's over the top. Besides, there are good sex scenes. RAH!"
3,Not Worth $19.95,"I loved the idea of having a workbook to go along with the main book (Maria Rodale's Organic Gardening Companion), but honestly, it was not worth the $19.95 I spent on it. It is only a workbook. If this book was under $10, it would have been a better value."
2,Could have been better...,"I ordered this book through Amazon.com. First of all, I had to re-read certain sections, because I felt like I had missed certain parts of the story. Are they Gods, or are they vampires? How does one become, ""part of the family""? This book had so much potential to be great, but the author didn't follow through with a lot of leads. Alexander and Kathleen should have been the main focus, thier love story could have been great, but there was too much other blah going on. I believe the author set up for a sequel, I hope she follows through on her storylines a little better. It's sad, because I could have easily loved this book had she stayed with a particular story. I wish her luck on her next novel."
2,"Very repetitive- and, let's face it...","She's not *quite* a master yet. I am an elementary school art teacher, and over the years I have observed more extraordinary child-artists than Alexandra Nechita. Her paintings are extremely repetitive and in the process of this book her art doesn't develop at all."
2,Metal zipper unaceptable for Canon A series,"I wanted a slim case for an A80 without the bulk of storage compartments for batteries and accessories. It is fine for this, and the padding and quality is first rate. But the metal zipper closure rakes across the camera body with each zip and unzip. This is unacceptable because it would ruin the finish in short order. Also, operating the zipper requires two hands - one to work the zipper and one to steady the case while you do it. A plastic clasp/velcro closing device would treat the camera better."
1,Consistently Missing Pieces,"Our nonprofit organization purchased these for one of our events. We bought 10 sets, which means we should have had 1000 glow sticks and 1000 connectors. We ended up with 999 glow sticks and 948 connectors, which caused issues for our volunteers trying to divide these, and cost us additional time to get a refund and reorder processed. It's a real bummer since our students love these, but they're more trouble than they should be to get them ready.(Plus, they're pretty obviously imports since there are at least 5 typos on the packaging.)"
2,"100 8"" Premium Lumistick Glow Stick Bracelets Assorted","I am not pleased with this product, the first bracelet that we activated started leaking. I am hoping this is not going to be the case with all the bracelets since they are going to be given out during a birthday celebration to children."
2,Lumistick bracelets,"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered these. But I figured glow stick bracelets and necklaces usually glow for a good day or longer. These were crap, we get about an hour of good glow, and then you can barely see it anymore. Additionally I live in a house with a 3 year old, so the container got knocked over fairly quickly. About a 2 foot drop to floor and about 10-15 sticks cracked so we had to use all those up. The orange sticks almost never work, I think out of 6 so far, only 1 has glowed. the Blue/purple are also pretty hit or miss. My daughter loves them though, so we will keep using them until they are gone"
2,"Cheap light sticks, but not the best quality","Some of them light up well but for the most part, they are cheap for a reason. I wish they made better glow sticks cause I would have bought those for more money if available."
1,Should be Lumisucks,"I purchased these for a cruise friends and I were going on. More than half of them didn't work. The ones that did work either glowed lightly or had entire parts that didn't work.These things are absolutely worthless. Listen to the other reviewers. If I could give them 0 stars, I would.Avoid the Lumistick brand at all costs."
3,Not Lumistick brand as advertised,"I bought these because I wanted the ""Lumistick"" brand, as these were advertised to be. What I got was a generic brand from China, which was ok, but not great. A quick phone call to FBL resulted in a refund, but be aware of this if the brand name matters to you."
4,glow sticks worked great,These were a repeat order. The glow sticks were used at a dance event and worked just fine. Everyone enjoyed wearing the bracelets. We ordered more for the next event.
2,they break!,"I purchased these to use as the 'light saber' for my 6 year old son's class valentines. When you crack them to make them glow, we have had several of them immediately break, and the fluid inside pours out. I'm not sure what the fluid is, but I'm worried now that it's dangerous as it was all over my son's hands!!"
5,GREAT!,they were awesome for our concert. It was good to haev all of my friends glowing so wer could find each other agian
3,good value!,"I used these glow sticks as party favors at my daughter's Sweet Sixteen party . Some of the glow sticks were cracked or had no solution in them. I ordered extra, so everyone ended up with one that worked. The kids really enjoyed them."
2,Many didn't work,"Purchased these for my daughter's birthday party. I usually buy them from Michael's, JoAnn, etc., but needed to order a bunch of stuff from Amazon. These were terrible! Out of 100, I'd say 1/3 split when we did the cracking/shaking that you're supposed to do to get them to glow. When they split, the liquid sprays out. 1/3 didn't glow at all. Not a good product."
5,Cheap Fun,"I handed these out on Halloween and my only regret is not purchasing more. They were a big hit with both the kids and their parents. Full number of glow sticks and connectors were included. They glowed nicely, especially considering the price.I notice a lot of people are deducting stars and complaining about the safety of this product, but I think the safety concern is there with ANY glow stick."
1,Not what is advertised,"When I bought these it gave the impression that I could make bracelets, necklaces, or goofy glasses. One problem there is nothing to teach the ends together. And these are not very bright"
1,did not glow!,I bought 2 packs of these for a library program and about 20 out of each tube actually lit up the others were either already cracked or just didnt work! Terrible!
1,DIM,"The first tube I bought were fantastic. The colors were vibrant and they lasted all night and well into the next day. This is the second tube that I bought and the red is more of a light orange, the pink is PALE and the sticks stop glowing within an hour. I don't know if this is just a bad batch or if they've changed the formula but these are AWFUL! I think I'll try my original seller and hope for better."
2,WILL NOT BUY THIS AGAIN,"The package camed open and some of the glow sticks where already glowing. very disapointed on this product. Would not recomeded to anyone. If you need some glow sticks, its better to order them direct from the manufacture, I had better success that way."
3,Good bargain,"For the price, which was under $10, for 100 Lumisticks, this was a very good bargain. I purchased these for our vacation last summer - so the youngest of our family stayed visible when it was dusk outside. Not that it was ever dark enough that they couldn't be seen, it just helped make sure he didn't wander off.Of course I wasn't using these as a babysitter or anything even remotely like that. It was just something fun for the kids, and practical for me. hough I must say they worked very well just to see the movement of the small children w/in the fenced yard. We were all running around together, all wearing light colors, and the younge ones little bracelets and necklaces glowed so they didn't wander, and stayed right with the older kids and with the parents."
4,Fun!,"We buy these for camping because the kids love playing with them after dark. It also makes the kids visible at night. Cheap and fun, but a few of them always seem to break without particularly rough treatment. I would buy these again."
1,Terrible Product,"I purchased these glow sticks for a halloween party. They do not work at all. In the meantime, I bought some other brand glow sticks at a local store and they worked immediately. Clearly the issue is with this product. The product is only $8.99. But to ship it back for a refund costs $5.05. So no real way to get your money back. DO NOT BUY these glow sticks!!"
3,Good for the money,A few didn't really glow. But most were ok. Not bad for the money. I'd buy them again considering the cost.
1,Missing Parts,"I purchased four tubes of these bracelets. Upon opening them and matching them to the connecting caps, we discovered that we were missing about 75 caps--really frustrating as we didn't discover that the caps were missing until it was past Amazon's return window. Not impressed."
4,Great Product,I bought these for giftbags for my sons birthday party along with several other items. These were the definate favorite of most of the kids.
2,Not terribly bright,"I bought these for a Halloween themed birthday party I threw for my 9 year old cousin. We used some for crafts, including sticking them in white balloons with the expectation of a pretty glowing balloon in a black light lit room. A lot of the glow sticks were so faint that we couldn't tell they were even working... The pink ones were pretty bright, but the others were much fainter. The kids didn't seem to have an issue with them when playing with them as bracelets, but as a safety issue, I wouldn't encourage these to light a kid up while trick or treating...Also, they broke SO easily. I used glow sticks for parties all the time in college, but these things were super sensitive. I was surprised, and it was inconvenient to have a bunch of them break while we were setting up the night before."
5,Awesomeness,"Bought these for Burning Man- enough to share with everyone, and they were of good quality (unlike some that snap if you even breathe on them). Will definitely buy again next year!"
1,Shipped glowsticks were NOT lumistick brand,"The advertised brand Lumistick is a good glow stick brand - and I highly recommend them. The glow sticks that were shipped were not the advertised Lumistick brand and some off brand. The quality of the glow stick was sub par and if I didn't need them that night, I would have returned them...What a shame..."
2,not that great....,"..... but not totally bad, about a quarter of them did not light up. Used the whole package in one event."
4,Missing LInks!,"The product received on time, and there were 100 - but they were not assorted in colors - only green, yellow, and orange - and worst of all - no bracelet links! How are we supposed to wear these as bracelets without the link? I e-mailed the vendor but have not gotten a response - and since I noticed so late (dumb me), and have a bachelorette this weekend - I am in trouble! What to do with glow bracelets now?!?!?!? Decorate? Glue gun onto something? Sucks!"
3,Another use for a Toy,"I ordered the glow sticks and rave lights to give away to trick or treaters on Halloween.It's a nice alternative to Snickers (yeah, they're good too!)and the kids enjoyed them."
4,Treats for Halloween,"Bought these glow sticks to hand out for Halloween. Kids really enjoyed them, something different. The only problem I had was when I was putting the little connector on them a few cracked and started to glow. Just a little sensitive. Overall good idea."
4,I like them,"I bought these for when I walk at night. And they are bright, colorful and yes people see me. I've had 2 that did not work. But all in all they are really good. I will buy some more of these."
5,Awesome glow sticks,Great glow sticks! They were MUCH MUCH better than the ones my pals bought from the dollar store! Will definitely buy again :)
4,"Good, not great","For the price, these glowsticks are a great deal! However, some of the colors (especially the orange) aren't very bright even in complete darkness. I'd definitely recommend this item- just keep in mind some of them will be useless."
4,"Overall, very good purchase",I used these for my halloween costume (I was Neon) and they were awesome. There were only a few in the tube (maybe 5) that did not light brightly after I broke them. Great for the money.
2,Bad connectors...,"So unless you're using this for just a bracelet, the connectors crack and the thing falls apart, I was simply doing an X shape with more than enough sticks and after about 20 minutes the connector cracks and the thing falls apart. Cheap connectors."
1,High Failure Rate,"I received one package of 100 and used all in ione evening, within one month of receipt. The packaging was good although the outside labeling and instructions were in ""Chinglish"".In short, the failure rate was about 50%, with the blue color having only two working bands in the package. Yellow was better. Only one band broke and leaked, not a real problem.The recommendation would be to spend a little more and get fewer items that were dependable. If these worked as expected, they would be a real pleaser for children."
1,No GLOW!,Clearly you get what you pay for. The price is too good to be true because LESS THAN 1/2 of these glow sticks actually worked. NOT A GOOD DEAL - NOT A GOOD PRODUCT.
3,"Glows only for 2-3 hours, and there are only 4 colors !","Despite being labeled in Chenglish, this product has the following problems:There are only 4 colors included, not 5 as amazon states. There is no orange color included.Glow time is only 2-3 hours, nowhere close to declared 12 hours.Also, glow intensity is quite weak, uncomparable with specialty glowsticks. The green one being the brightest one, and blue the weakest one."
2,Many were already activated,Seemed like the product might be past its use by date. Even the ones that were not already activated were not very bright when activated.
4,Great fun!,"I love glow sticks!! We played with them for hours! These are good and have connectors to make bracelets, but no connectors to make balls or flowers."
1,Disappointed,"I bought these for my Neon New Year celebration, and was totally stoked when I got them. I didn't unwrap them until the day of the party, so I had no idea until it was party time. All of the red ones didn't work and only a few of the green/yellow would light up... very disappointed in this product."
2,Very disappointed in this product!!,"I ordered 400 & only about 100 of these worked.....very disappointed. We didn't discover they didn't work until the night of our event... too late to make any substitutions. This was our giveaway at our local parade, needless to say we couldn't giveaway defective merchandise!"
3,OK,"You definitely can't beat the price, so they are actually worth buying. A few didn't work, but for the most part they served their purpose for my daughter's glow in the dark party. The kids loved making them into necklaces w/the connectors they provide. So my guests were able to make both bracelets and necklaces."
5,"8"" LumiStick Brand Glowsticks Glow Stick Bracelets Mixed Colors","Worked great as party favors! Could be used as bracelets of necklaces, connector included, good quality, bright mixed colors,ots of fun!"
3,Bright. Good fit for most people.,"I bought these for a party. They fit everyone just fine, but some had to close them over the wrist, while others were able to close them and slide them over their hands. Either way, they fit. The larger ones would have been too big."
1,Bracelets?,"Shouldn't bracelets actually have a means to make them bracelets? What I got was 100 sticks. No way to connect the ends to make bracelets. This will hamper my ""special bath"" night tonight..am I missing something?"
1,Awfully bad,"I tried 3 sticks, they didn't glow at all...instead they sprayed my face (and some went into my eyes) with the toxic liquid inside ... it STUNG MY EYES LIKE CRAZY ... and even the skin on my face was burning. About 5 minutes of intense eyewashing later, I threw the whole package into the trash...this product deserved zero stars."
2,Cheesey Dollar Store Glosticks,"They barely glow, full of air bubbles, only light up well when you jam them in your pocket, and are activated way too easily when placked in back pocket (while walking). Save your money, theyre noththing like the picture. You want this caliber of glostick ? Go to the nearest corner shop or gum ball machine. Didnt even use the connecters. Big dissapointment, glad i had other glosticks to use.... In the end I wouldnt advise you buy this unless youre scrapped for other options."
4,Good Price & Good Glow,"I was relieved to get these and see that none of them had accidentently cracked in shipping (which I've read happens in some reviews). They were safe in a large tube and on top of the sticks inside was a little zip lock bag of the plastic connectors (I've bought smaller packs of glow sticks before that claimed to have connectors but didn't include any!). I've used only several of them so far and they last varying times but always at least a few hours. I only had a problem with one orange glow stick that glowed a darker shade of orange than the others and didn't last quite as long. For the price this was a good buy for me; they glow brightly, last long, and are fun as a toy/accessory."
3,Fun,These are fun. You would enjoy them and they are a great value. Be gentle or they might break; they can be a fun mess.
1,Lasts about 3 minutes,I mean these things didn't even last the 20 minute drive to the venue where we wanted them to glow.... and it wasn't just a couple duds because we put on about 30 of them. Buy them from someone else.
3,Worked well - but quite a few broke,"Glowsticks did what they were supposed to do - glow, but unfortunately, quite a few of them broke with trails of the liquid all over the floor, counter, and people's clothes."
1,Half of the lights were already illuminated.,Half of the lights were already illuminated. I had to go through to determine which work and which didn't. 37 did not.
3,cheap entertainment,I did have one break as I didn't COMPLETELY break the glass tube inside all the way down the stick. I tried to bend it into a bracelet and it broke. Make sure you completely break all the tubing inside. It doesn't glow as bright as I expected or as long but it is not of the same size as a glow stick so it therefore it won't.
3,Sugar free Halloween with Festive Color,"Kids from 2yr olds to 60 yr olds loved the glow-in-the-dark bracelets. The ""glowing"" lasted for 2 days. I loved walking up the street seeing the rings of color, and glad folks driving in vehicles could see these tricker-treaters. We did preconnect the glow sticks into bracelets. Couplings connect the sticks into braclets and worked great, BUT about 10% of them broke. We tried taping the couplings, but that did not work either..A couple of sticks left florencent material on our hands as well. We were glad we preassembled this product as it gave us the opportunity to weed-out damaged glowsticks. I would do this again.I just hope the manufacture fixes the couplings.."
1,50% Duds....,Over half of the glow sticks did not work. Every single red failed to glow. Way too poor quality. Would not buy again.
1,cheap substitution - buyer beware,"I received a package with a sticker saying Lumistick hastily applied over the label of a Chinese product called Ruieguang. I am sending it back, but a quick google search showed that they are very poorly made and have exploded, injuring children. NOT what I am going to hand out on Halloween."
3,glow in the dark sticks,"several of the sticks leak although all arrived in good condition. the liquid stinks (has a strange smell) and it gets all over the arm of the kid. one thing though, once these stick stop glowing, you can just hang them (the ones that are intact and not leaking) on the ceiling with a push pins. it will continue to glow if the black light is on. although it stops glowing on its own without a black light."
2,They leak.,"Item showed up on time. About 1/3rd of these glow sticks leak. They were packaged fine, they showed up on time, but they are much lower quality than I am used to. Many of them leak at the ends."
4,lots of fun for kids,only didn't give it a 5 because our pack didn't come with all these colors shown. We don't have the green or purple - but it's still fun.. especially for baths.
1,ugh,Half of them came broken. That was a waste of MONEY. Never buying from this company again. I have better luck buying them from the store.
4,Great for the kids.,"Our four year old absolutely adores Wubbzy, and I have to say this DVD entertains her every time we put it in. It has 8 episodes total, and comes in an interesting 3D case that's sure to grab the eye. As a parent, I appreciate shows like Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! that are perfect for the 3-4 year old. It is very fun and educational at the same time. Wubbzy frequently displays a wonderful 'don't give up' attitude even when things don't go as expected. Wubbzy's colorful world is full of oddball shapes and characters, keeping kids entertained and having fun. Because of that, I would highly recommend this title to any parent looking for quality, fun programming for their preschooler."
5,Interesting stories and good lessons,"I was impressed with this cartoon series. First off, the theme song is catchy and fun, and each episode is laced with fun background music behind the cute and easy to understand dialogue. The graphics are clean and colorful and overall has a simplcity that I find refreshing. Each episode runs back to back, easily keeping a child's attention. I would say that this is perfect for kindergarten age children and younger.An especially nice feature was the cool packaging, which included a colorful 3D holograph scene and helpful details about the episodes and extra features.I found myself sucked into the adventures of Wubsy and Widget. My favorite episode was ""Attack of the 50-Foot Fleegle"" where Wubsy got a new pet and didnt follow the care instructions, giving his new pet candy, with crazy results. With each episode, there is a lesson that the kids can take with them. I was impressed, and would recommend it to a friend. Very cute."
4,Wow Wow Wubbzy,"My son who is 1.5 years old, just loves this dvd. There is a lot of shows recorded on this dvd. He shouts WOW WOW WOW for me to put it on for him. Keeps him entertained and he enjoys watching it. The loves to hear the tunes in Wow Wow Wubbzy to the point that he gets up and dances. So at least i know my son is not being a couch potato but he is also being active at the same time.I too like to watch it with him, it's a very cute show that tells you about morals and to do good things in life.It's a great dvd if your child is into Wow Wow Wubbzy!"
1,not happy,i wasnt happy w/this dvd in the auction the seller put it was a new dvd and it wasnt it was scratched and it looks like a copy .
4,Cute Pre-School Stories!,"""Wow, Wow Wubbzy: A Tale of Tails"" is another cute pre-school character from Nick Jr. This DVD offers 92 minutes worth of stories/8 episodes, as well as extras like printable pages and DVD games. As a mother of a 4-year-old, I like him to have some programs that are directed specifically for him. We do not watch TV, so everything we watch is via a DVD. Nowadays, you can pratically get any show on DVD, which is great for us. As a fan of Blue's Clues, this struck a similar chord. Wubbzy and his friends, Widget the inventor and Walden the scientist, give the series and educational appeal. We are a nerdy family, so it appeals to us to have entertainment that is not just noise and politically correct mumbo-jumbo; Wubbzy also shows pre-scoolers how to do the right thing when having a moral dilema. All around a great show."
4,Great video,This is a great video. Several episodes in one DVD. My 4 yr old loves the wubbzy show. Great values in the stories.
4,"The kids love it, so that's all that matters.","I don't see the appeal, being from a time where cartoons were more life-like, or at least more animal-like, but whether it's the cool colors and graphics, or the wacky shapes of the characters, it keeps the kids fully engulfed. Lots of episodes and a long run time are also a plus. A very nice kids DVD, recommended for ages 3-8."
4,Another tale of bravery and the triumph of the human spirit,"This is an amazing story of a selfless woman and her daughter who risked everything to save several Jewish families during the Nazi holocaust of Europe. The descendants and some of the actual survivors venture to the location that became part of their family's heritage and, in a way, relive the struggles that took place during the years of 1942-44. It is a very important story that needs to be told. I only gave it 4 stars because it did drag on in places. It is worth it to hang in there with the narrative until the end. Fabulously told."
5,"Brave, wonderful Saint!! No 4 Street of Our lady","I truly was blessed by this true story of a Catholic lady who lived for the Lord...choosing to risk her life each and every day to allow 13 persecuted Jews to hide in her pigsty loft, and also underneath her kitchen in a cellar.The story is full of many dangerous turns and twists, as her nosy neighbors suspect she is harboring Jews. I watched this 2 times because it is amazing how brave this lady was...in the face of certain death herself, she chose to feed and water them every day for 2 long years.I am sure you will be touched and encouraged and also stunned that these things actually happened when a man of hate, Hitler, gained control of many people, destroying their natural affection."
5,Fantastic book,"What a wonderful read. Even if you are not a historical buff, this read is facinating. It takes you on a wonderful journey."
3,Almost a Tour de Force,"Meron's work on the relationship between Shakespeare and the law is groundbreaking. Although not quite on the level of Bloody Constraint, this earlier work of Meron provides insight into the canon and the role of chivalry. Really solid reading at 8:30 in the morning over a cup of coffee and a croissant or late at night next to your edition of a complete Shakespeare. Meron, a professor at NYU Law School, clearly drew upon the resources of the Global Law School Program and provides insight into the relevance of Shakespeare to modern international law.Bravo!"
5,Review of Western Digital 250 GB Hard Drive,"Works good so far , and darn cheep, 25 years ago this drive would have cost well over $1000.00"
2,Exchanged...,This drive became corrupt while installing an OS on it. It basically died before I could even utilize it. Exchanged it for a new one and so far it's been working flawlessly. Installed Windows 7 on it and have been using this drive exclusively for over a week now with no problems whatsoever. I will edit this review if it ever dies again...
1,Do NOT order this product!,"I wouldn't advise anyone to order this product! We purchased the SATA drive, and they send us a completely different model with much older technology. The external and internal packaging was all mislabeled, but the older model number was clearly on the drive itself. I received poor service from Amazon trying to make the return, and will not be purchasing similar products in the future."
1,6 months in and hdd died.. uugh!!!,"no longer recognized in bios ... data all gone on client.. stuck spindle can't spin up, chatters.. still a WD fan!!"
3,Three great cuts = ***,"Three out of eleven isn't bad in Baseball and by 1993 it wasn't bad in Rock and Roll, and here, in a Melanie studio comeback, we have three beauties: ""Estate Sale"", ""Wear It Like A Flag"", and ""Someday I'll Be An Old Record"". To add lustre to the gems is the matured, more soulful and expressive voice of Melanie Safka - she sounds better than ever.There are spots here and there on the rest of the st where the old fans can smile out loud and say, ""Wow....that's Melanie!"". But, once again, it's her voice and not the strangely over-produced, over-arranged material. With that early '80s, metronomic drum-machine beat, Bob Dylan's ""Hard Rain"", is an incohrent atrocity. Hard to believe.Still, a cool package, with lyrics and wonderful pictures of Melanie (who probably didn't hear the final mix at the point).One more: when it works, it works, and having family around, especially on vocal harmonies, doesn't hurt at all."
5,This book is important.,"This book addresses the issues related to trauma that are prevalent within our schools. We are often so busy focusing on educational issues that we do not get to the core issue....the presence of trauma. In this book, readers are given helpful insights to acknowledge trauma as a learning issue....and the potential for creating resources for students to help them to thrive. This is a tremendously important piece of work."
4,Loved it! Fun!,"The game-style format is great! I had loads of fun and before I knew it, I was learning a lot of vocabulary and answering simple to intermediate questions. It is very well-made and teaches you on a very instinctive level, something not always found in a formal classroom.Most of my friends agreed with me, and they were learning Japanese, too , by just playing along (they didn't even mean to)!"
1,Words cannot describe my hate for this product.,"The first CD I kind of liked. That was when I was young and innocent. The entire program is a joke. The second CD teaches not a thing. I am disgusted, I hate Instant Immersion Products. Some how they always seem to mess something up. A word of advice DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,My daughter loves Biscuit.,She borrowed the book from the school librarry and we somehow lost it. The librarian insisted I replace it - hence the order.Biscuit lives on...
1,Keith wasn't killed for writing the book,"First of all, i wasn't sent out here by the ""Illuminati,"" i couldn't tell you if they really exist or not.But I will tell you that Jim Keith died because he broke his knee and didn't go to the hospital when it happened, he died of a blood clot during surgery. (...)Persoanlly, I believe that a few of the things Keith has brought up in this book are correct. I'm sure there is CIA experimenting and other crooked things going on, and i think microchip implants are a bigger threat than people realize. But that does not mean that this should be looked at as a gospel."
2,i was duped,it is a interesting piece of fiction i read it in two days . knowing what i know about world affairs and the war on the home front. this man seemed to be trying to convince one to adopt the idea of a need for such control. i hope these devices are possible because the reduction in crime/terrorism alone justifys the need for control like this.to keep the idiots zelots and loonys in line.i like the lifesytle i am accustomed to and a means to keep it sound sencible. but on a final note fanatic books are a good laugh. this book is horror sci/fi. at best.a good laugh!
5,A story that expands your view of life,"Greer could be anyone of us and it is so easy to relate to her as she struggles with issues of fear, sexuality, love and compassion in order to raise to greatness. It is rare to encounter a book that can have a lasting impact as Goddess Rising. This story will definitely expand your view of life. Read it once and read it again after a few months. You will notice new insights each and every time you read Greer's story."
1,Does not work,This Xlr cable did not work for me at all. Perhaps I've gotten a faulty cable (which I'm hoping). Audio Technica should focus more on the quality control for their products.
5,Cable fits my needs,"I use this for my desk mic I use for recording. It is the perfect length and the connectors are of excellent quality, especially for this price. Definitely would buy these again for other mics in the future."
5,This is simply a great cable.,This cable is very well constructed. I use it in my DJ business and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one like it.
4,A good cable,"I've used this almost two months now and still now problems. As far as I can tell it's a high quality cable - the rubber grommet on the female end though broke on mine. However I believe that's attributable to some mishandling on my part. It only recent broke. Had to fiddle with the lock mechanism to get it back into position, but after that it still works fine.Also I tend to like Audio Technica products so although it might be trivial and not reasonable, the brand assures me of some minimum of quality I've come to expect. (That and I love their logo and design of products. Bonus points for making something as mundane as a cable look nice.)"
4,Excellent,"This is a nice XLR cable. 10 feet is a good amount for a home small studio. Great low impedance of outside sounds and no real buzzing or static so far. I hate to say it, but it sound better than my $30 mogami cable, and if you know much about cables, you know mogami is supposed to be one of the best for recording. Solid."
4,works good,"Bought it for personal use and it works great. I practice on my garage and it's fine, don't think I would trust it more than once in a show. Just seems a little flimsy for pro audio."
3,Not a good showing,"this is a poor representation of a great artist. Steve Earle should have put out a better live CD than this. There are some real flaws in the editing and some of the selections were poor choices. Stick with his studio stuff, you will not be disappointed there..."
5,if i had one CD this would be it,"hey, i'm no critic, but i am a music lover and this is probably the best, most honest, heart-wrenching live album i've heard. if ""i ain't ever satisfied"" ""someday"" and ""the other kind"" don't take you home, you never had one and if ""dead flowers"" don't move you to tears, yer not alive. ""billy austin"" will move you to tears even if ya are dead. Buy it!"
3,Sometimes I Feel Like A Mountain,"A very good live record. To me, the best track, by far, is ""West Nashville Boogie."" It is the best blues song by a white artist that I have ever heard. When he sings ""I got a razor in my pocket . . ."" I always get goosebumps. That moment alone is worth the price of the album."
3,Not one of Earle's best,"There is a generous amount of music--over 74 minutes which is a lot for the typical Steve Earle CD but you can find better renditions of these songs on his other CDs. Get Guitar Town and Copperhead Road if you want to hear most of these songs done in a studio. Also, I had eagerly anticipated hearing Earle's version of Dead Flowers but it isn't nearly as good as the original by The Stones."
1,"Great Product, Vendor Not Reachable","I'd be cautious purchasing this item from this vendor. I encountered one of those endless customer service loops and their own recording says the ""store"" is closed for rehab. The 121 dollar shipping cost is kinda outaline seeing that these days the Big Box stores have ""free"" shipping."
5,So enjoyable.,"Saw these guys in concert last year, great show but short! So I got this so I can watch anytime. Great music."
5,Great Buy! Two Discs: An Audio CD and a DVD,"Hall & Oates are fantastic, after over 30 years of performing together.This CD/DVD shows them at their best. It's a great concert, based on the ""A&E Live By Request"" call-in show in spring 2003. This set includes an audio CD of the concert, as well as a DVD with the concert, bonus songs, and an interview.Excellent!!!!!"
5,it was a great gift,"Great product,great shipping and price!! It was a gift and it was enjoyed to the max."
5,Better than Ever!,"As a group that seemed to Own the late 70's and early 80's..I must honestly tell you that Hall & Oates are tighter,more polished, slicker and Better than ever. Their harmonies are Flawless, The musicianship is nothing short of awesome.Charlie DeChant is on Fire on Sax! If you're thinking that all hope is gone with what you hear on the radio anymore..don't despair..Hall & Oates will put you in a groove,and keep you there. Their new material is as strong. The Show is extremely entertaining from start to finish. I've been a pro musician for over 40 years..and trust me..this is good stuff! So buy it already..I promise you won't be sorry."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,I just love this dvd!!It has great acoustic versions of old favorites that will never die! You will find yourself playing it over and over.
2,Finally they evolve,"After long years of waiting finally they come up with a DVD that all H&B fans must see. You will be amazed that after long years the duo keeps on getting better and even best. With the DVD concert you could not ask for more the septup was super, the song selection are very good, the audio is good, and especially when the band performed two songs unplugged."
1,buyer beware,"I love H & O and have been wanting a DVD of this concert. But be warned that if you purchase this set the DVD that comes with it cannot be played on a US DVD player unless you have a DVD player that can play other regions. Unfortunately, mine doesn't. So disappointed!"
1,Return to the seventies,Did not like the concert. Performances were dull and the arrangements were not to my liking.
3,"good, but not great.......",">I bought this after reading everyone's glowing reviews, however I was disappointed! It's not that they're older, but after singing these same songs for all these years their enthusiasm has waned. They've changed arrangements and phrasings. Of course, this is natural. but if you bought this DVD hoping for the Hall and Oates sound....you'd be disappointed as I was. The audio quality is great and the video is well shot, but for the true H&O sound as you remembered...get their Rock'N Soul Live DVD! It really delivers!"
4,great show,"I didn't know Oats really didn't sing, it was all Hall. He sounds really good, if you liked them in the 80's you won't want to miss this music DVD."
5,This fantastic album is no longer available on amazon,"but check out Celestial on CDBaby where this album, the previous two and the brand new album, Electric Road, are all now available..."
4,A Book for Beginners,"Monte Smith has produced an excellent book for anyone wishing to begin authentic beadwork. He provides complete information regarding the materials and supplies needed. There is a lot of information about the technical aspects of this craft. The book has excellent illustrations on how to make the various stitches with beads on leather, which interested me the most. He has also included numerous photos of original artifacts that a person can use for design ideas. There is also a coded (by letters) reference under the photos which indicates the museums that have those items on display. The only improvement this basic book could have would be color photos which would be of help in selecting beads for a project."
3,Depends on what your looking for.,"I just got this book the other night, so I haven't had the chance to thoroughly read it yet. So far, I think the text part is better than the photography. I find it easy to read and it seems to touch on several topics. Unfortunately, not being well versed in Native American/Indian history, I don't know how accurate that information is, so I'm no help in analyzing that part of the book. He seems to me to do a good job describing techinques, and the illustrations are helpful to me. If you're looking for good photos though, I would not recommend this book."
2,A killing in Tuscany,"Carlo Rienzi is a young lawyer who finds a perfect move against his cheating wife and overbearing father-in-law when he decides to defy family wishes and defend a girl accused of a vendetta killing. Set in Tuscany, the case is important because while the public has sympathy for the girl, it is seen as crucial that the cycle of vengeance murders not be allowed to continue. Two foreigners-- Ninette Lachaise and Peter Landon-- are unwillingly drawn into the family and legal drama and struggle to keep their dignity and new love for each other intact.While marketed as a mystery, _Daughter of Silence_ is much closer to a romance. And while the main thread is interesting enough, the book is plagued with stagy characters and strained psychological analysis. Originally released in 1961, this was the 11th book of the best-selling Australian author."
2,too noisy,Found the noise level to be unacceptable and promptly returned. Not bad otherwise. What did I expect for $12?
3,12 volt fan,Hard to clip on anywhere and direct it properly. Noise is acceptable. Weighs more than you think so cant clip to sunvisor.
1,noisy fan,I BOUGHT THE FAN TO USE IN A TREE STAND WHILE HUNTING. THE FAN SURGES )UP AND DOWN NOISE) IN THE LOW AND HIGH SPEED.
1,Piece Of Junk,"Maybe I received the rare 'manufacturer's defect' model, but this fan was a toad! It wasn't very powerful, and it made an annoying grinding sound, like it was dying; and it was brand new! I didn't bother replacing it, so I don't know if it was defective-take your chances, if you want to!"
3,cars only,The fan is okay -- I should pay more attention as I didn't notice that it was for a cigarette outlet and cannot be plugged in to a regular outlet.
5,Amazing.,"This documentary about the NY Ballroom community brings all of the spectacular visions to entertain but also gives the people being filmed the opportunity to share their strength and wisdom with film viewers. Differing viewpoints on the ball experience, in the ny community and being POz, Gay. Appreciated hearing differing values, self concepts and generational experiences from gender variant women. A Lesbian wins House Mother of the Year for the first time and that was cool. History of Balls extra gives excellent historical information and cultural context. Loved it."
5,great tuck-in bed,My 3 year old daughter loves this bedroom set - it actually looks like her room complete with our cat that sleeps on her bed. She especially likes the cloth bedspread that she can tuck people (and animals) in. Great for a dollhouse - I got one of the old 6364 Dream Houses because they hold furniture better than the new ones. My only complaint about all the loving family stuff is that I wish it were smaller - more on the scale of Playmobil figures.
4,CHIPPING PAINT,"I bought this set to go with the other items for the Loving Family Doll House. My three daughters ages 4,7 and 10 all enjoy playing with the doll house, and I'm addicted to getting every piece available to go with it. It's so frustruating to see that they areno longer available or out of stock"" when I want an item. I have had a problem with the paint chipping off the bed in this particular set. It's under the cloth sheet, so you don't notice it, but it does bother me. ..."
2,Workmanlike effort to tell the sad tale of the original Cleveland Indian,"Author McDonald does a decent job in giving the play by play of the summer that Maine native and Penobscot Indian Louis Sockalexis spent with the Cleveland franchise in the National League back near the turn of the 20th century. Though too much time is spent describing the game details and not enough on the Native American experience and Sockalexis place in it, I can recommend this book to baseball fans and Mainers interested in finding out how (possibly) the Cleveland franchise in today's American League came to be known by its present day nickname."
5,Quality product! Best bang 4 the bucks,Like the description says..happy with the product at an awesome price...OEM quality And as of right now no lights no error..
5,2003 Acura RSX-S Sensor -- Great Price!,"Works perfectly for my 2003 Acura RSX-S primary O2 sensor replacement. This is also the best price I was able to find. Product has very high quality threading and wiring, and even comes with a small packet of copper-colored anti-seize. Been running this 20,000 miles and still running strong!** Update 4/6/2012 **Still good 30,000 miles in. I rely on this to tune my supercharged K20A2 engine."
5,Denso Oxygen Sensor,"I bought this for my 2002 Honda CRV LX. Prior to purchase, I used the web to get comments on Denso and Bosch brand O2 sensors. Saw lots of negative comments on Bosch sensors working properly initially, but failing in a short amount of time. Researched prices. Dealer wanted $330. Amazon was $138. Fit perfectly. Big plus is the connector is a perfect fit. No wire splicing required. Did the job in my driveway in about 20 minutes. This sensor fixed my check engine light (had to reset) and boosted gas mileage back to what it used to be. So far, I'm very satisfied."
5,Works well.,Installed product. All the comments are accurate. You can do this yourself and save lots of money. The Honda dealer wanted $351 just for the part.It took some effort to get the old sensor loose and free but other than that you can do it.The tricky part was getting the connector apart.The top of the connector has a clip that mounts to the bracket. If you squeeze the top of the clip it will slide off the bracket. In my case I did not need to remove the bracket. Once you do this you can get a better grip on the connector and it will disconnect pretty easily.It took about 50 miles of driving before the CEL reset.
5,It Works,Purchased this to replace the original in my 2004 CRV. Exact replacement for 1/3 the price.
5,Quality Product,This is a quality OEM replacement. Fit my 2002 Honda CRV perfectly - easy to change at home saving hundreds of dollars compared to going to the dealership. The car's running smoother and the check engine light has not come back on!
5,Works well!,The dreaded check engine came on and I had to pass emissions so I borrowed my friends scanner and found out it was the oxygen sensor. The acura rsx has two sensors so make sure it's the right one before you order. The price I got it on here was around 90 dollars which is pretty expensive for an o2 sensor but since it is a wide band it's not that bad and you really don't have a choice. The dealerships want 400+ for this and an hours worth of labour so save yourself 5-600 dollars and do the job yourself if your mechanically inclined or find a friend to do it since it's not that difficult of a job. This part is listed for the type s only but the only difference between this one and the base models is the length of the wires (base model's is longer). This DOES fit on the base model rsx so don't hesitate to buy it.
5,Works for 2003 Acura RSX,"My 2003 Acura RSX (base, automatic) had CEL codes P1166 and P0134. After replacing my original oxygen sensor with this, my CEL went away. It was my first time replacing one, and it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I used an oxygen sensor socket that I purchased from Amazon as well. There was one slight difference from the OEM sensor though. This sensor's wire was slightly shorter than the original (maybe like 2 inches). Because of this, I wasn't able to attach the excess wire to the plastic clamp. It didn't seem to be a big deal though as the wire wasn't touching the cat or anything."
4,Honda CRV O2 front sensor,"This would be a five (5)star rating except that ""love it"" is hardly appropriate for an automotive replacement part. But, it was virtually the exact item needed to resolve the issue, right down to the brand.The price was comparatively good when compared to local dealers, and SUBSTANTIALLY better than the Honda dealers.Installation is relatively easy, EXCEPT that care must be taken to figure out the snap-in terminal, and how to disconnect it. This latter point is the doing of Honda, not the sensor mfr. Installation would otherwise have been about 10 minutes. To avoid breaking the terminal, take the extra 10 minutes to figure out how to properly disconnect/reconnect the wire harness."
3,not just right,Oxygen sensor was supposed to fit 2003 Honda CRV which it didn't. Wires were to short by 4 inches. Had to splice them to get it to work. Other than that it worked well.
4,It just works,After I install the oxygen sensor the check engine light disappeared and was able to pass emission test. It just works.
5,Denso 234-9005 Oxygen Sensor,"I believe Honda had original Denso sensor on the car in the first place. It failed a little prematurely with only 55,000 miles on the car. See how long this one lasts. Regardless, Amazon's offer beats my local parts store by far. Check engine light went off immediately after I replaced the sensor......Henry418sc"
3,Nice Gentle Practice,"I like to use this DVD when I'm not quite up for the challenge of intense yoga practices. It is invigorating and energizing yet very gentle. The instructor, Rainbeau Mars has a very relaxing style and pleasant personality."
5,Rainbeau's new yoga tapes are a definite must have!,"I recently purchased the new Dawn/Dusk yoga series. All I can say is wow. The practice is a wonderful combination of challenging poses and learning to breathe into your body and let go of all tensions. As someone who is trying to let go in my life, I can honestly say that Rainbeau's yoga is a key element in achieving that goal. Her mantras and ""yoga language"" are inspiring and so very relaxing. I truly recommend this series to anyone who wants to improve their yoga practice and learn how to let go and be still with yourself."
3,Good but not Great,"The program over all was fine, but Rainbeau Mars needs to work on her instruction techniques. I was also surprised with her 'affirmations' which seemed stuttering nor memorized. It was also strange to see an instructor adjusting her hair throughout a lesson.However, I did find the program itself okay."
2,Yoga for Beauty,Starts out easy but quickly switches to poses and movements too hard for beginners. I've done these two dvds several times and am unable to do the entire hour. I like the dusk dvd better...but still would not have bought this video if I could have reviewed it first.
2,Nice Toy - Annoying Tone,"I purchased this item for a six year-old who has everything but her own bedroom doorbell. We all loved this item until we put the batteries in and rung the bell. The sound is an annoying electronic sound that just doesn't cut it in such a toy. A little store in my neighborhood has a similar chime that sounds when you enter the store. It's good for a store, not so good for a child's bedroom. There is no volume control either. I cannot recommend this item unless the manufacturer decides to change the tone to one that is more pleasing to the ear."
3,Not great,"Purchased this for my daughter. After we installed it, we discovered that even though it is not hard wired, it dings everytime her ceiling fan is turned off. Just kind of annoying."
4,Good gift for little girls,"My daughter loves this hanging on her bedroom door. Now she is 8yrs old, having a little privacy is so cool to her."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Bottom line: for a journalist, Allen understands nothing about baseball. His selections are ludicrous. Rube Marquard over Frank Robinson? Mark Belanger in the top 100 of all time? No way. This book is terrible. I'm very upset I wasted a cent of my money on this. Don't buy it."
2,keep shopping,"re the first cd, talk now: The girl enunciates well but speaks with a tiawanese accent. In one case, (the ankle) the girl gives the wrong (tiawanese?) word for the body part rather than the mandarin word. The guy slurs his word endings a bit. The cd only has a handful of words, perhaps what you would expect to learn in the first week of a standard college class. The cd makers neglected to pay an artist to draw the pictures that correspond to the sentences so good luck there as well. I think they had a not particularly gifted first grader do the scribbles.The second cd, world talk, does NOT pick up where the first one left you but jumps ahead by an unbridged leap. There is no real help provided. you find yourself learning which picture matches with which sentence without ever learning what they are actually saying. Futhermore, the second cd is boring and not at all engaging. surely there is better stuff out there."
2,"Okay for speech, but doesn't help with Chinese characters","This software is okay for learning to say a few basic words and phrases. The variety of activities makes it more interesting than a phrasebook. But it won't help you if you want to learn Chinese characters, which are the more interesting and important part of the language. If you want to learn to read Chinese, you'll need a good textbook and maybe a Chinese reading & dictionary software product like Clavis Sinica."
4,Immersion Mandarin Chinese 2 CD-ROM,"It's different than what I have used before. But, it's great for folks who already have a little bit of Chinese language exposure."
1,Awful,"Well, I have been learning Mandarin for sometimes, and recently I saw a friend of mine bought this item.First of all, it doesnt teach the correct basic for beginners, so you will find it hard as you progress in the language later on in your life. Why?, because it doesnt use the correct pinyin(romanized version of the characters), which is very important, even for the Chinese people, because they need pinyin to type mandarin in computer.Second, the author is a little racist there putting an ugly farmer from country side of China in the cover, giving false idea of what China is, nowadays. Why put such a big picture of the farmer? I dont feel the need for it.This product I belive is intended to mess you up on the way to the top, it just makes your learning harder."
3,"Pop music, but good pop music","I saw Mitsou on Canada's Much Music and after much trouble finally tracked down this album. Well worth it. I listen to it from time-to-time when in the mood. I would rate it higher, but it is just not unique enough to consider a higher rating. I believe that had she not been French-Canadian her music would have taken off. As it is this is a very good album. If you like early Madonna, Tiffany or other female pop artists you will like this album. My favorite songs are La Corrida, Bye, Bye Mon Cowboy and Spooky (a very cool version with Mitsou's accent). Recommend"
1,Best of Cornwall by First,This DVD does not play - I suspect that it was produced for UK use only. I returned it and asked for a new copy that would play - was sent the same thing. It should not be offered as playable in America
1,Don't buy in the US unless you are a techie,"Did not work in 3 different dvd players. It did work in one and on a computer. We had to totally strip the video and reformat it to get it to work. I bought this for my grandmother who is from Cornwall and I had to spend 2 weeks figuring out why it didnt work and then stripping it to get it in the correct format.That said, if you can do all of that or you get lucky and it plays on your DVD player, it is a good video."
4,Getting Better,"This is an enjoyable series, and this installment was much better than the last two.The only problem I have with the series is that it never seems like Kendra really solves anything -- she just seems to run around town accusing everyone until she finally hits on the right culprit.Looking forward to the next installment."
5,Awesome addition to our train set!,"We love all the smart track pieces because it seems to being the set ""to life"" - our son has been collecting pieces ever since his 1st birthday and this is the one toy that he has always gone back to every day. Worth every single penny spent as it still looks brand new (and it's 8 years old!). You cannot go wrong with Brios!"
5,"If you like BNL, give this a listen",Stephen Duffy cowrote many of the songs on the first few Barenaked Ladies albums. This album has some great lyrics and melodies. I especially like Entourage.Give it a listen!
3,good but ive seen best,I think over all its an ok movie kind of weird at times and a bad ending I thought it would've been a better movie by the awards it received but the casting was good the way the movie was made was good but the story kind of weird its a movie worth seeing just dont expect too much out of it.
4,3 Piece Set Stainless Steal Mesh Strainer Set,"I've really enjoyed these strainers. They stack together very nicely for storage and are 3 very convenient sizes. The reason I bought them was to strain raspberry seeds out in order to make a raspberry puree... Probably wouldn't use these again for that, as the holes were a little too big and difficult to clean out, but for most everyday uses, these strainers are great. Not the easiest to clean by hand, but I should think in a dishwasher it'd be a piece of cake. I am happy with my purchase and have had a couple people ask where I found these. I would definitely suggest them to others."
4,Great,"Just to add to overall applause. These are great. Seem pretty well made, better than I expected. Might not last as long as my overpriced cookware, but still, very, very useful, and fairly priced. I got these for friends too. Consensus is good so far. Many uses."
5,Nested Strainers,"Needing a new strainer, I searched for a replacement. The three nested Stainless Steel Mesh Strainers were perfect for the jobs at hand. Upon receipt of the order I checked and they were exactly as advertised and in use they have been all you could ask for.Getting 3 to replace one has been fortuitous, as several times smaller amounts of food that needed straining was encountered. These units have been a great asset to my kitchen and I am happy to recommend these to any who are contemplating their acquisition.L. Williams"
1,too expensive,"I can buy bath salts for much less. guess I shouldn't have bought this, opps. Just too much money for salt."
4,Very useful,"This book is very useful. It is a definite help to graduate students trying to understand macroeconomics. It would probably not help undergraduates.The challenge of explaining the major schools of thought, and explaining their strengths and weaknesses is a major one. The authors also go over some non-orthodox schools such as Post Keynesian and Austrian. However, some of the diagrams are poorly explained and the writing is a bit incomprehensible in a few chapters. Also, the book does not go over growth theory, which is probably a major part of any graduate macro class. On the whole though, it is one of the best macro books available."
5,Remarkable - Amazing - Buy it!!,This is a truly remarkable piece of music. You are thrown back in time when listening to this CD....It happens all right in front of you. This is more than worth buying. Giuliano Carmignola plays an outstanding performance as is the orchestra - a gem discovered and treasured.
5,Crispy pictures.,"These are Kodak Elite professional films. Using with good camera and lens, the quality rendered is obsolutely superb. If you ever wander why professionals take better pictures than you do, this is one of the reasons. At 100, it needs slow exposure time for most situations, you might want to buy 400 if you are just taking family photos. 24 pictures is not really enough, try to get 36 if it's available. But anyway, the pictures have really nice tune and clarity."
1,film was exposed and pictures,film was exposed and pictures did not turn out. don't recommend if you are taking important pictures. Purchase at store instead
1,Useless,"This is what I call a ""slideshow"" book. It has lots of graphics and images, but very little valuable information (not even a good GUI reference). The title insinuates that there might be a discussion about creating Effective Design for GUIs, but there isn't. I expected samples of good/bad designs, steps that one should take to design a proper interface.Here's a sample of one section of the book:""If you try to close and image or exit the program without saving, Paint Shop Pro asks what you want to do with he unsaved picture: ""Yes"" to save and close, ""No"" to close without saving and ""Cancel"" to neither save nor close (i.e., to continue editing the picture).""This is typical of what is contained in this book. Showing images and stating the obvious (in this case, there is no mention of the Yes/No/Cancel dialog is not good interface design)."
1,A dated waste of money,"I had to purchase this book for a web class I was attending. It was so dated, it was a waste. Luckily i purchased it used, so it wasn't much money, but it was a total waste."
5,favorite toy by a mile,"My daughter received this for her 2nd birthday and immediately went around the room asking everyone ""Want tea?"". She has since developed her own routine of asking which cup you want, adding cream and sugar, stirring (always with the correct spoon - each one has a different shape to match its cup) and warning you that the tea is hot so you blow on it before you drink. She also does a great dance to the teapot song. It's been over 2 months since we got this toy and she plays with it every day. A real winner!"
4,Great first tea set,"My daughter is one. She loves this tea set. It has a lot of pieces to keep track of so we have to watch her really closely when she plays with it. I like because it has ""dishes"" for 4 people (rather than 2). Its the perfect size for her and the colors are really cheerful and bright. She has been rough with it and it has stood up well so far. It is really cute. People always ask me where I got it. The tea pot musical noises aren't very pretty- its kind of an obnoxious noise."
5,MUCH CHEAPER AT FISHERPRICE.COM,Hello~ I just bought this for my 2 year old daughter. SHE LOVES IT!! The song and noises the teapot makes are a little annoying but tolerable. I bought this at Fisherprice.com for $10.00
5,My Granddaughters Love This!,"I got this for my granddaughter's second birthday. She loves the musical teapot and pushed the top to play the song over and over until she knew the tune. Her 5 year old sister began helping her ""pour the tea"" for the tea party. They played with it for almost two hours that day and still love it. The cups and dishes are colorful and just the right size for them."
4,A Big Christmas Day Hit!,"My 21 month old daughter got this as a Christmas gift this year, and she just loves it. It is an adorable toy- It comes with a tea tray, teapot, 4 cups, saucers, and spoons, a sugar bowl and a creamer. The cups and saucers are different pastel colors and each saucer has a design on it (butterfly, heart etc). Although I don't think it really needs this feature to be a fun toy, the teapot plays music and makes a little ringing sound when you ""pour"" the tea. It looks to be very sturdy, and I'm sure we will get hours and hours of fun out of the set. Of all the Christmas my daughter opened yesterday, this was one toy that kept her attention, and we are happy to say it makes a wonderful addition to her toddler kitchen and play food collection. Good job, Fisher-Price- this one is a big winner in my house!"
4,Take the battery out!!,"All in all this is an ok toy, my daughters love it. BUT the lid of the teapot could literally drive someone insane! It makes a noise if you just think about touching it. We removed the little battery and everyone feels a lot better about playing tea party now. At first my oldest daughter didn't understand why it stopped playing ""I'm a Little Teapot"" but was just fine when I sang it for her instead."
1,very disappointed,"I was so disappointed that you could not use this tea set. The cups have holes in them, so if you try to drink out of them, they leak. So much for tea parties. I called Fisher Price to complain, and they did send me a voucher for another FP product."
4,Great Toy,"This is a great toy, I only would have been happier if the battery was working to play the music."
3,Cute but annoying,"This is a cute little teaset but also very annoying. Anytime we move anything in the toybox, it sets off the teaset and then we have to dig through and find it to stop the music!"
3,Tea Pot toy,"I got this set because my daughter loves ""I am little Tea Pot"" song. But I was a bit disappointed. Both the song and supposed to be ""tea pouring sound"" are so high pitch, 80s-computer-game like that it really annoys both me and my husband although my daughter seems not to mind. As for size, colors, durability, they are all as expected."
5,"Most beautifully colored & durable tea set, I ever seen!","If u are looking for something kid proof, good quality & looks gorgeous this is it! I have tile & my little 2 year old boy came in the middle of my little girls tea party & threw the tea pot across the room. I thought for sure it was broken, it survived! Amazing quality"
3,Do yourself a favor and get a teapot that doesn't make noise!,"My kids like this, but the teapot is so annoying. After a year or so of hearing it over and over and over everytime it moved I moved it into the trash can. The kids like their Disney one just as much and it doesn't make any noise."
2,annoying,This tea set was fun for about one week. It's been a year and the teapot finally recently fizzled out. I finally put it outdoors and could still hear it's annoying tunes for weeks. Skip the sound effects!
1,Disappointing,"I was so excited to purchase this toy as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Once the toy was opened we pulled out the little plastic battery-saver tag and... nothing. No sound. Checked batteries and they are fine. Called Fisher Price and they do not supply replacement parts for this item. Unfortunately, I no longer have the receipt for this item. Wal Mart says they do even exchanges, only they are not carrying the item any longer. Hmmm, I wonder why. So, we have a plastic tea set that makes no noise. Otherwise, looks sturdy enough. My advice would be TO CHECK FOR SOUND BEFORE YOU PURCHASE!"
3,"My toddler likes it, but I find it a bit dissappointing","I bought this for my 18 month old daughter because her au pair said that she needed a tea set. She loves it. She plays tea party with her au pair every day. She likes to push the button on the top of tea pot to play music. And it plays I'm a little teapot when you tip it over.But the music is high pitched and annoying. It is a bit loud and there is no off-switch or volume control. The end of the Little Tea Pot song doesn't sound correct. It sounds like the Jeopardy game show theme song. I'll be happy when the battery runs out.The other disappointing thing about it is that there are tiny holes around the sides of the cups. You can't actually put any liquid in these these cups, despite what other reviewers have said. But I guess that's also a good way to prevent messes. When she's older, I'll probably get her a nicer tea set. But for a toddler, this is a pretty good set."
2,First time disappointed with Fisher Price,"I purchase this for my 2 yr daughter. She was only able to play with it for a few minutes. The first time she went to place the teapot on the pedistal it snapped off; leaving a jagged edge and a sharp metal stick protruding out of the stem of the pedistal. Called Fisher Price about the problem withthe toy. They had me send it back to them, and promised to send us a new tea set. I have yet to receive it - that was 9 months ago."
1,Fun...but,"My daughter got this tea set as a gift, and she loves it. But what little girl isn't going to put ""tea"" in her tea set? And like said before there are holes in the cups so it is a bummer when trying to have a dry tea party."
5,She loved it!,She loved the tea party set and knew immediately what to do with all the items. She had a ball with it. THanks for sending it so quickly.
3,fantastic but missing a saucer,"great set! cute, sturdy, perfect colors and for little hands (i have a 22 mo old). My set was missing a yellow saucer, so i decided to send it back before she gets too attached to it. i don't want her upset in the months to come. other than that, it's perfect and would have gotten four stars (it doesn't hold liquid = minus a star)."
5,Pricey at amazon,Toys r us is selling this for 15.00. And it's never out of stock and it also has two different colors to choose from. Love this for my daughter!
5,Hours of fun,"My daughter received this for her second birthday and it has been a favourite ever since. The cups, saucers and spoons are just the right size for little hands (and not too bad for parents hands as well if you are playing along). The teapot is cute and makes a twinkling noise when you ""pour"" or plays the song ""I'm a little teapot"" when you press the button on top. It also comes with a milk jug and sugar bowl. All the things you need for a wonderful afternoon tea. Everything fits neatly on the tray and my daughter doesn't seem to have too much trouble carrying it around when serving tea to me and her special doll. This is a wonderful tea set for play, not too many pieces and made by Fisher Price so you know it's going to last."
5,fun tea set,"My daughter now 4 - has had this for 3 years and her little sister is now using it. It has withheld even the most rough play. I love it because I have put it in the dishwasher and it has no problems. My kids like to not only play ""pretend"" but use the cups as well for snacks and juice. this has to be one of the best sets out there and if for any reason something gets broke just contact the company, for a small fee - if any - they will replace it. I would buy it again in a heart beat!"
1,Wish I had read these reviews before I was suckered into buying this toy.,This is the most worthless toy I have ever seen. What kind of idiot makes teacups with holes drilled in them so you can't use them as cups? And what kind of idiot am I to actually buy them? I expected better from Fisher Price. What a disappointment.
1,Dissapointed,"Tea sets made since 2007 have holes in the cups and unless you find a way to safely patch them with foods safe materials - they cannot be filled with water, tea, or any other beverage."
4,Cute tea set,My 2 yr old daughter loves this tea set. She enjoys stirring the tea in the cup. We do not put water in it but she loves to pretend to pour the tea.
5,Great gift!,"My 2 year old received this for Christmas, and has loved it since she opened the package!This would make a wonderful addition to any little girl's kitchen, as it is as durable as it is pretty.I would buy this as a gift for someone else in a heartbeat!!"
5,My Baby girl loves this!!!,"My baby girl got this as a gift for her first Bday. She loves it! and was not too young for it. Its a toy that she loves now, and will grow in to. The colors of this tea set remind me of the tea cups at Disneyland... with their bright pastel colors. Its very durable as well."
1,Thanks for the warning,"Thanks to ""PeterInSF"" for the extensive review on My First Tea Party. It seems a like a cute and nicely illustrated book, but as an athiest I would have been very annoyed to order this book for my daughter and find a god reference in it."
1,"Confused - Mfr says for 2 yrs & up, not 3","I couldn't give a rating, because I haven't purchased this yet, but plan to do so for my daughter's 2nd birthday. I have the Fisher Price catalog in front of me, which says specifically that it is for ages 2 years & up. It does not say anywhere that there are small parts/choking hazards as TRU indicates. I have noticed that Amazon/Toys R Us does not always list the correct mfr's age for the toys they sell. I've noticed this with the Disney My First Princesses when they first came out, but TRU has since corrected the ages on the site. Just FYI. I will correct the rating once I purchase the toy."
5,Little girls love tea parties!,"Every little girl needs a tea set. It's kind of a rite of passage from a baby girl over to something more....My daughter loved hers, but she has now graduated to a demitasse set, as she has noticed that nobody else drinks out of plastic toy cups..."
4,Musical Tea Set,We purchased this product for our granddaughter's 2nd birthday. She really enjoyed it. Its design is perfect for this age group.
4,Very cute,I bought this for my 2yr old daughter. She is really into having tea parties right now. It is well made and durable. The only thing I don't like that much is the pouring sounds don't sound like pouring tea at all. They could've made that more realistic. Like the tray. Very cute set and my daughter really seems to like it too.
4,Great Toy enjoyed a LOT,My daughter makes tea for me everyday and I have fun with her. She loves it and that's why I too.The only thing is this thing should be a little cheaper.
3,A tea set with holes in the cups?,"My granddaughter loves this tea set, but honestly Fischer Price, holes in the cups of a tea set. Have you ever known a kid who has a tea set that doesn't put water in it. My husband is plugging all the little holes with glue but we shouldn't have to do this. Even if the cups are not very full, as soon as the are tipped to drink out of, out comes the water through two holes on the front. As far as the rest, it is great. . . charming,fun, and she loves the music."
5,Highly recommend this tea set!,"This is the perfect tea set for hours of pretend play! The ""musical"" tea pot is especially good because it's not so loud and obnoxious to listen to during play. The cups are a great size because little hands can easily hold them, and the color and design of the set is very ""girlie""! The bonus is that it all sits in a tray keeping everything together and easy to carry."
4,Tea Tine,"This was the perfect toy for my 18 month old granddaughter. It is sturdy enough to use constantly and has survived ""little"" hands and fingers with less than nimble handling. I would recommend that every Grandmother have this in her home!"
4,perfect for your toddler,"I purchased this tea set 2 months ago after searching for a plastic version for my 2 yr old. Most I had found were ceramic/breakable. This is very colorful and perfect for my daughter's little hands, she can pour the tea pot with no trouble due to its light weight. She has loved it since she saw the box and plays with it daily. The only negative is that the price has increased from 9.99, which I purchased it at,up to 49.99 and is now currently selling for 39.99. It is well worth 9.99 but I certainly would advise against purchasing it at these higher prices that Amazon is trying to sell it at now. You will be disappointed at having paid 40.00 for it. Hopefully, Amazon will again price it at the more appropriate amount of 9.99 which fits for this plastic toy."
4,A toy for the long haul...,"We recieved this tea set for our older daughter's second christmas, 4 years ago. She has used it constantly since than and is now enjoying tea parties with her baby sister, who is two. Both girls have had hours of entertainment with it! However, I must confess we removed the batteries the minute it was opened and have NEVER put them back! The song is a horrible refrain of ""I'm a Little Teapot"" over and over and over!! It plays every time the pot it tipped, or bumped, or dropped or moved in any way!! My in-laws brought the box in their car 4 hours and it sang most of the way...My girls don't know it's susposed to sing and have never missed it in the least!"
3,Slightly dissapointed with the tea set,"I purchased this toy with my 15 month old in mind. She loves putting covers on items so I thought this tea set would combine imagination with dexterity. Its definitely not easy to put the cover on the teapot or sugar dish and its not easy to remove either. My youngest and mellowest cried with frustration. Even my daughter who is almost four, comes to me to help put on and remove the tops. Its a nice toy for imagination purposes but its unfortunate that the stem is not larger to allow more room for little fingers to manipulate the teapot and sugar dish lids."
5,neices fav toy,"my neice loves this and it helps her learn some table manners *cough* not that she needed any more lol anyway before i get myself into too much trouble with my brother, i will say she has a blast with it and the ""magical"" sounds it makes will only bother you until the batteries die lol so it was a great preasent, my neice loved it and for a short while it drove my brother mad lol he's still thinking of a way to get me back."
5,Great tea set for the price,My 2 1/2 year old absolutely loves this tea set. It's great for pretend play and it's nice that it comes with 4 cups and saucers as well as a sugar and creamer dish. It's a great item for the price.
5,Adorable!,"We got this for our 1 1/2 year old for Christmas and she loves it. We all play tea party all of the time. The colors are great and the cups, tea pot, plates and bowls are a great size; easy for little hands to use. It is really cute when you push the button on top of the tea pot because it plays the song ""I'm a little tea pot"". My only complaint is when the lid is tipped over it makes noice until you lay it flat, it can get really annoying if it gets tipped over accidentally, but other than that we love it!!"
4,"I'm a little tea pot, short and stout....","Although this tea set plays the tea pot song over and over again, I hardly ever hear it. As a parent, this is a wonderful invention! The kids can push the button over and over again and enjoy the music, but the sound doesn't travel very far.The set is made out of very durable heavy plastic. It has survived the traumas of being thrown around and chewed on by our puppy. It looks just as good as it did coming right out of the box.The different pieces are all so very cute and completely match. They are soft colors that will match any room decor so it looks like they belong."
5,Very durable!,"Our daughter received this toy when she was 18 months old. She is now 4 years old and she still loves playing with it. It is very durable and has withstood falling on the floor many times. The musical tea pot has also lasted this long and still plays the music. Although, that can get a bit sickening after a while. ;)All in all, a great tea set!"
4,my daughter loves it. her grandma even wants one.,"this tea set is a lot of fun. it is durable. my daughter is 2 and a half and she tends to be hard on toys and this tea set holds up. my daughter loves to play tea party. the tea pot plays music as you pour. if you press the button on the top of the tea pot it plays ""i'm a little tea pot."" when Violet's grandma (my mom) came to visit she absolutely loved the tea set. it made her happy. she was laughing and saying she would like to have one, so i am ordering her one for christmas. it will make her smile and Violet and her can have tea parties at grandma's house now. this is a great tea set. the only draw back i can see at all is that all though everything fits on the tray at one time, it is very crowded. when my daughter wants to do things with out my help i just make sure all the cups and saucers aren't there at the same time, so her little hands can put everything she see's on the tray."
1,Not designed for liquid!!! Do not recommend it.,Of course we put liquid in it as my grandson and granddaughter expected a real tea party. It is messy as the cups have holes and of course the music no longer plays. I'm looking for a replacement tea set now.
2,Great unless you want to use it for real,"I was so excited to receive this as a Christmas gift, however, I was greatly disappointed when we went to have our first real tea party. Although the tea set is great for pretend play, it can not be used for real. I filled the cups up with juice and discovered that all the tea cups have holes in them, allowing everything to spill out. When I called to complain to Fisher Price, I was told that this is done on purpose because of new standards. They were nice enough to send me a voucher in the mail, however, I would probably not purchase this again. If you are looking for a tea set that you do not intend on really using, I would recommend this, however, if you plan on having a ""real"" tea party, look elsewhere!"
3,Musical Tea Set has holes,"Fisher Price Musical Tea Set is beautiful,fun to play with, and my granddaughter loves it. It only has one major problem- no one mentioned that the cups all have two holes on the right sides! How do they expect anyone to put real liquids into these cups? I saw something like this in a joke magazine; glasses with holes so the contents spill down the front of the users shirts/dresses!The holes are on the side facing the drinker if the drinker is right handed. Since both of my grand daughters are right handed, they can't use the cups except for pretend. It isn't very practical to teach a child how to really use cups and tea pots since you can't put anything in the cups. The set is really cute and I was looking forward to my grand daughters using them. I am so disappointed and feel cheated."
4,"Great tea set, but watch the price (should only be $13)","This is a wonderful tea set that comes highly recommended by parents who have looked for something that has just the right tea cup size (big enough to actually fill with liquid), can be used by 2 year olds (many of the others have small parts and are thus for 3+), and is durable. [I bought another one (Schillying Summer Bugs Tin Tea Set) that turned out to have tiny cups and saucers. While cutely painted, seemed much too tiny for small hands to hold and certainly could not hold more than a drop or two of water.]Do watch the price, however. The price that I saw at Amazon when I was ready to purchase it ($60) was way too expensive. Today, I see that the price is $39. Still much too high. From K&B; Toys, I found the same item, in perfect condition, well packaged with prompt delivery, for only $13. This is the right price for this wonderful gift for a child."
5,"Worth every penny, folks. You'll wear a groove in this CD.","The tracks are highlights of an album that you would be hard pressed to find in the United States, ""Instinct"", released in Europe mostly for this band stepping up. The rhythm is fresh, inventive, smart, and stylish. The sounds are molded with careful artistry supporting the harmony, edge, and accents of the heavenly voice of Nicola Hitchcock. The songs are deeply moving, guessing at an instinct that sits close to us, when we become still. Talent like this deserves an ear. I wish I could send these songs to everyone..."
4,Great Hard Rock Album,Michael Schenker of Scorpions and UFO fame and Robin McAuley made one killer of a band and album. This album is full of soft ballads and kick-ass rockers. Michael Schenker plays guitar like few others and Robin McAuley is an excellent and underated singer. The album rock...hard. Fans of 80s hard rock will cherish this underated masterpiece.
4,"3.5 - 4 Stars Not McSG's best, but not bad","The McAuley Schenker era usually gets dumped on for being too ""commercial"". Well, isn't the point to make your music accessible and sell albums? This album is ""radio friendly"", but Schenker is still Schenker especially on Never Ending Nightmare.The best songs include: Eve(a good rocker), When I'm Gone & This Broken Heart(both mid-tempo songs) and Lonely Nights(a simple fun rocker).Robin McAuley is the best vocalist Schenker has worked with, outside of Phil Mogg(UFO). He can handle any song from full out rock to the gentler ballads.If you're buying McSG start with Perfect Timing and then pick this one up. A solid album with good songs."
2,Not good if you need a quality speaker phone,"The speakerphone on this phone is inferior to what I needed, very low volumn and not so clear.Everything else looks fine."
3,Display unreliable!,"I love the display feature of this phone, but unfortunately this is the feature that has given out on this phone two times in five years. I am about to either replace our current model (a second replacement for same problem) or go to a different model. Worth the money if I didn't have to pay it THREE times... if it weren't $129 a pop the unreliability would be easier to overlook."
2,Lamp shades,The small lamp shades that go with these lamps are cheap looking and too small for the lamp sizes. I will have to buy lamp shade replacements because it is too much trouble to return the lamps.
2,Cheap Lamps,The description does not indicate the table lamps have to be assembled. The shades appear to be too small for the lamps. My floor lamp had a ding in the base near the cord. Not worth sending back. I will get rid of these first chance I get.
5,We love it!,Looks very nice around her neck. The picture's accurate. Excellent for the price. or even if it was more expensive : Worth the purchase.
5,"A book of wit, action and a perfect recreation of paranoia",A security agent living in an undergroun utopian society (run by a paranoid computer) goes undercover in an attempt to solve a crime.Combining references to the popular RPG game and new ideas this book is not only hysterically funny but also very well written.
3,Great Addition to the Fisher Price Doll House,"This toy can be used by itself or as a part of the Fisher Price Doll House. The light-up and sound features are really a nice touch. The quality of the toy live up to the high standards I have for Fisher Price products. The ""base"" of the play station is a pond area surrounded by grass.The kit includes several pieces including a watering can, wheel barrow, flowers to plant, a decorative arch and more. The only drawback I've found to it is that it uses batteries."
2,not as I had hoped for eyeglasses,"I got this product to try to repair tiny scratches on my plastic lenses of my glasses. I have a scratch resistant coating and invisible bifocals with an internal sun sensitive darkening. These glasses are about four years old. I applied the product, waited five minutes, rinsed with hot water and gently removed the haze. I repeated the process. Folks, the scratches are still there. The product arrived in a timely fashion, it just doesn't seem to work for me."
3,Used this for scratched plastic sunglasses,"It took off the polarization on my glasses. There was scratches on the polarized part of the glasses so it took care of it. However, my lens are not dark enough to be good sunglasses by them-self so I'll probably have to buy new ones"
3,Not what I was looking for.,"I read on line that this product worked well to buff scratches out of plastic glasses. I used it on safety glasses and the scratches are still there. It didn't work as I hoped it would, but I realize this was not the inteded purpose of the product."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"I was a skeptic about Armour etch being able to remove scratches from glasses, and for good reason. I didn't work for me at all, in fact it might have made my sunglasses worse."
4,Great for crafting!!,"This is a great product!! Works exactly like I was hoping!I had to go to the internet to find directions of use however.There should be directions by the manufacture included, especially given the acidic nature of the product!"
1,boo,"I did 4 applications and have now given up. The first time, I left the Armour Etch on for 5 minutes, no difference in the scratches on my sunglasses. Then tried for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and then 30 minutes and there was absolutely no change. Very disappointed in the product!"
1,Did not work.,"This stuff is a farce. I used it and it would not remove the coating off my glasses. In fact, I used it several times and it etched the glass while leaving some of the coating on the glass. I had to buy a new pair of lenses. Wonder who wrote the positive reviews? As you can see, I am not happy with this product."
5,worked great on poly glasses,"not for glasses but used it to get rid of the scratched up ar coating of my poly glasses,worked great.1st one wiped off easily the 2nd one had to rub it hard but they r clear n scratch free."
3,Armour Etch,"I'm not sure if the product is sold sealed in stores, but the one I received was not. Either way though the product worked as it should."
4,"Works as advertised, not as imagined.",Chemical etching is easy and doesn't make very much of a mess at all. Lots of fun as long as you're not expecting the result to look like etching with a dremel. This cream doesn't leave a highly discernible shape as much as a frosted patch that you have to look at at an angle to see well.
5,Used for other than etching glass,"I used this to strip off the anti-reflective coating from my polycarbonate lens eyeglasses. It worked perfectly to remove the coating and the scratches in the coating which had made the glasses useless. New lenses for my glasses were supposedly USD$400.00 so I had nothing to lose by putting this on the lenses. However, after using this to strip the coating off, my glasses are like brand new again."
5,truley amazing,"I read a lot of reviews about armour etch not working on plastic glasses lens.I tried it and was truly amazed. I had anti-glare coating on polycarbonate lenses and put a very thick coat of etching cream on both sides of lenses and timed for 5 min.DONOT RUB TO TRY TO CLEAN,let set,,wash off extra after 5 minutes and clean with soft cloth,,,you will be amazed...do a second coat if needed..i just spent 350 dollars on new glasses befor i tryed it..i wish i would of never spent the money.the lenses are like new.."
5,It does work!! OMG I can see it's a miracle!!!,"After reading many of the reviews, I was a little hestitant about trying it. I had the so-called reflective resistant glare put on my glasses. After only a couple of days they were scratched. What's funny is that I cleaned them properly with the solution and soft cloth wipe from the eye doctor. I went back to the place where I bought my glasses to no avail of having them replaced. I gave up ever using them again and went to my back up pair. Anyway, to make a long story short, I did some internet searching hoping there was a cheaper solution to repairing the scratches. After only two applications, the scratches were gone and my glasses were clear!!! OMG!!! I can see... IT'S A MIRACLE!!!MY ADVICE IS TO ONLY USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE THE REFLECTIVE SCRATCH RESISTANT GLARE. YOU CAN TELL IF YOU HAVE IT BY THE RAINBOW REFLECTION IT PRODUCES WHEN YOU HOLD THEM UP TO LIGHT."
2,A little over-the-top.,"This was not the best book in the world if you know anything about the military, special forces or current events. The writing was slightly labored and a little over-the-top. Sometimes the dialogue was just plain silly. I didn't read the first two books in this series, and I probably won't after reading this one."
2,Nothing neutral about the views of this author,"Charles Sasser's books are some of the most racist & sexist pieces of right wing propoganda in the form of a novel I've ever seen. You'll cringe and cringe often as you read his stuff. The stories are somewhat entertaining though highly unbelievable, especially if you've ever served in the military and know better."
5,Outstanding episode and classic Trek,"This is truly one of the best television episodes ever made for any series. William Windom turns in a performance of a lifetime as the delusional Matt Decker. When you look at all of the Trek follow-up series, none can match the intensity of an episode like this."
3,Shake rattle and roll !!!,"This is a good drive for burning disks. I've never had a bad burn with this drive. But it is very noisy at high read speeds. I first had this drive in a micro ATX case and it was bearable, but then I moved all my computer components to a full sized tower. Im afarid that my computer is going to shake apart when this thing is going! I recently got a new LG DVD/CDROM drive and Im using that as my primary drive cause this thing just vibrates too much. If ya can go for a different drive. This thing is just too noisy."
1,Extremely annoying vibration machine!,"This drive is ok as a burner...I could give it a 4 star rating...but when used in the read mode to install programs or play games it is a -10 star performer. This thing vibrates so loudly when installing programs from a cd I think it is going to fly apart. I reurned one and a got a replacement from HP(absolutely great service). But it was just like the original. I asked them to replace it with a 9500i, but that was disallowed. So I am writing this review of a real lousy piece of gear. I have many HP products, this is my only complaint about any of their gear."
4,Wizard of Oz: Dorothy Barbie Doll,I'd say you expect to much for $18.99. After all 1939 when you may have bought a detailed version for less went by several years ago. For the price Mattel has done an excellent job. The likeness and quality of this item for the price is commendable. If you want better you will find you probably have to spend anywhere from $60 to $100 plus. Do your homework before complaining. I understand when people complain if they spend over $50 and get junk. I don't when they spend less than $20 and still get good quality. Kids that enjoy theThe Wizard of Oz ~ Judy Garland 1939 Classic (Import - English - All Regions)should love this.CA Luster
5,dorothy doll,box and doll came in mint condition. received promptly gave as a gift my niece loved it . would order from seller again
3,Dorothy Doll,A very nice collector's item for those who enjoy Barbie or anything from the Wizard of Oz.A great gift.
4,Very Pretty!,I purchased this Barbie for a friend's daughter's birthday as she has really been in to The Wizard of Oz. It was the only gift at her party that she wanted to open right away and that everyone wanted to see up close! Score one for me!!
4,Another pretty Barbie doll,"This doll is just as described. It was a great price from Amazon and arrived on time. As for the other reviewer complaining about the shoes- no they aren't glittery, but at least they are red. I would have never complained to Mattel, that's just being too picky. And as far as them not staying on her feet, have you EVER had a Barbie doll whose shoes actually stayed on?? Overall, it's just as described and a great deal. My kids play with them all the time."
2,Disappointed a bit...,"Yes, the Dorothy is perfectly detailed, she is almost as great as the original Mego version... but, THE SHOES! YIKES! They are not detailed as the other reviewer stated, I'm wondering if this lucky person got another doll that Mattel is selling. The shoes that came with my doll are cheap plastic ones... no sparkles whatsoever. Would it have killed Mattel to add glitter to the shoes? Worst part to come... the shoes will not stay on the doll. If we put them on with or without the socks, they will not stay on. So basically, the best part of the Dorothy doll doesn't work. We were so disappointed, that we complained to Mattel. They couldn't help us with this particular problem, but offered us a generous gift certificate to buy something else. Of course, my daughter wants the Glenda doll.... wish us luck with her shoes!"
1,Who is this book for?,"For whom was this book written? If you don't know tensor analysis, GR and the rest of that stuff you're sure not going to learn it here. If you do know tensor analysis and the other stuff why are you reading this book?"
4,Good product,"Overall an OK product. I shopped around for a good price and found this one to be one of the best. I was a little disappointed in the sturdiness of the tray, but it serves the purpose. I am pleased with the delivery. Arrived on time and as promised. I would buy from this seller again."
5,Edible and visual treat!,"The ""traditional"" food of Israel is a mix of Middle East with Russian, German, Polish, & a wide range of cultures. Capturing the flavor of Israel is a challenge. ""Taste of Israel"" not only captures the tastes of the country, it shares the history, the people behind the process, culture, art, current events, and blends it all into a fantastic recipe to capture the spirit of Israel. The photography is fantastic, clear, sharp and capturing the essense of the country. Excellent as a gift book to honor the country or to keep in your cookbook racks. Lovely design and layout. Reprinted in 1998 and shame on Amazon.com for not having the new version online yet! I want to buy one for all my friends and family as a gift. Publisher: Steimatzky."
5,Don't miss this innovative book,"When was the last time a ""real"" artist painted like this? Who else would have thought to use gel pens, dimensional fabric paints, regular fabric paints and dyes, and, best of all, rubber stamps in one painting that can be used in about a million ways? Kahn paints on muslin, but you really can't tell it's fabric. By the time I finished a couple of pieces, I couldn't tell I had painted on fabric either. I think this is a real plus because then you can stick your painting on anything, however rough it may be, and have a beautiful, interesting, and highly unusual piece of art. Don't deprive yourself of it."
5,Can't put it down,"Wonderful. This book is packed with colored pictures of examples which I can stop examining. The author's background as a teacher shows. The book is beautifully organized and instructions are clearly and carefully written. The intended audience is probably the crafter who wants to move to the next creative level and she's hit the mark. She makes the reader believe that is possible to be creative with ordinary materials. Throughout the book she names brands of materials which will work with each project and the book is liberally sprinkled with recommendations on a wide variety of paints, inks, etc -- and the materials she uses are widely available. She has resisted the urge to push her own rubber stamp product line though many of the samples use them. This is a book I'll go to again and again and I won't loan to anyone."
3,Glad I got it from the library....,"While this book does have some good ideas and techniques, I was put off by the repeated and blatant promotions of the author's line of stamps -- a little too self-serving. Also, since she used only her own stamps in the project examples -- as well as a very limited color palette -- there is a disappointing sameness to the look of the samples. Most books of this type show the work of multiple artists: More variety of styles and colors would have made Kahn's book much more interesting and inspiring.So, while I did come away with some ideas that I will use, I'm very glad that I borrowed the book from the library, rather than paying for it."
5,"Great book, a must read for real science fiction addicts.","This is the introductin into a unique view of the universe. Isaac Asimov created a universe with six star faring races, humans being the latest addition. The big blow to these races is that there is evidence of a much greater race that left the galaxy long before any of the other races had even achieved consciousness. This is a collection of stories written by various science fiction writers based on the initial guidelines set down by Isaac Asimov. A must read!"
4,Karajan is Electrifying,"This is a very good collection to have. Karajan does not disappoint you: brings out the best in him, the orchestra and Beethoven. It also gives the viewer that chance to see his very unique conducting style and as always an electric performance. It also includes and incredible performance by Ms. Mutter that brings out the best in her.I gave it only 4 stars because you could not see or get a feel of the audience. It would have been much better if the audience reaction to this music were also included."
5,music man,"This concert DVD is outstanding. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir is wonderful and Audra McDonald is a revelation. I show this concert to friends and neighbors every Christmas. Without exception, they love the concert and are awed by Audra McDonald's talent. Buy this DVD. It will be a favorite for years to come. It's that good."
5,Audra McDonald is Amazing in This,"Audra's voice along with the Choir is just amazing. This is my favorite with the Choir yet and I really enjoyed the others. She sings like an angel and seems so overjoyed to be there while she sings. If you love beautiful Christmas Music, you HAVE to get this DVD. You will not be disappointed!"
4,Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir,This was a Christmas present to my sister. I am sure she enjoyed it very much but hasn't said. I'm sure she was well pleased.
5,Luke was the one,"I never was much of a country music listener. Then one day i heard ""The Gospel According to Luke"". I loved it so much that I never forgot it. Now it has been close to 10 years since I heard it. I remembered the title, so I began to search for the artist. What an impact this songwriter has made for me. I know this song will never be forgotten."
5,Hidden Treasure,"I would never have heard of Skip Ewing had I not seen him on Austin City Limits (PBS). He was so good I bought this album. Why this guy never became a superstar, I'll never know. Every song on the album is very good but most are outstanding. Coast of Colorado is perhaps the prettiest song I've ever heard. Buy this CD."
2,falling out of love with amazon,"I think every episode of Yo Gabba Gabba is pretty great, thought it is my daughters enjoyment level that matters. I downloaded three 20 minute episodes and set up amazon's special player, and I am pretty disjointed at the shockingly bad video quality, on what I assumed would be near broadcast quality. I understand overhead goes up a bit when you need to deter piracy and all that, but over half a GB for horrible quality is pretty bad. Amazon is so good with everything I have ever done it will take much more than this to deter me from using them loyally, but I have to say my experience with the video downloads has been very bad."
5,Great show for the kiddos!,"Our kid loves this show, and goes crazy whenever it comes on. Good, cheesy kids show. Would recommend to anyone, unless they have no sense of humor and don't like upbeat shows."
1,Garbage,The show is great and more importantly my daughter loves it but I can not watch or download (on PC or kindle fire) and of the three episodes that I just purchased to bring on a car trip. Further maddening is the fact that I had to wait over 20 minutes on hold w/ customer service and could not get a resolution (a download or a credit) 20 minutes of my time on the weekend is worth more than the $6 on shows so I figured I would write a review and move on but it is the last time that I try to download any video for this kindle.. maybe I'll return that too.
1,Rivets don't last at all,"Loved the chairs when we first received them for the cockpit of our boat. The chairs were always rinsed and brought inside after use. They were also very comfortable until the rivets started to break. My husband replaced the first broken rivets with nuts & bolts - by the time the 2nd & 3rd rivets started to break and collapse the chairs, they went flying into the dumpster. Like the previous reviewer said the warranty is guaranteed to make you NOT use it!! Very expensive throw away chairs! Garelick should be ashamed of themselves!"
5,Amazing,"I've owned this CD since the moment it came out and had been following some of the music before its release at Kyler's live shows. She's an amazing writer, musician and person. I've had the opportunity to talk with her and you'll never meet a sweeter person.This is definitly her best work. Each song on this album is so thoughtfully created and has spoken to me about different times in my life. It's definitly a must buy. I go through weeks where I never take it out of my cd player and I always come back to it. I never tire of her beautiful voice and writing.I definitly recommend this cd and I also recommend trying to attend a live show. They're amazing also."
4,Complete Anthology Of Brenda Lee's Hits!,"They once referred to Brenda Lee as Little Miss Dynamite because such big noises came out of such a little girl, but she sure wasted no time making her way to the top ten list. From her famous ""I'm Sorry"" to a soulful ""Emotions"" to ""All Alone Am I"", she was the perfect female vocalist of the early sixties, sharing the limelight with Connie Francis, who also had a number of top ten hits in the same era. With ""Break It To Me Gently"", ""Losing You"", and ""Everybody Loves Me But You"", she enjoyed a long string of consecutive hits. So, too, with ""I Want To Be Wanted"", ""Sweet Nothings"", ""Fool Number One"", ""You Can Depend On Me"" and ""sweet Nothings"", she guaranteed her place in popular music history. This is a great compilation of all her hits, and I am sure you will love listening to it again and again. Enjoy!"
5,Why isn't Brenda Lee in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?,"Listen to her first record ""Jambalaya"", to ""Let's Jump the Broomstick"" and to the absolutely rocking ""Is It True?"" and tell me why this lady isn't in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? She STILL sings rock and roll better than just about any other woman out there."
4,"A sad, funny look at domestic life","I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer below. I found Ellen's story to be realistic, funny and sad by turns, and filled with memorable characters who alternately had me feeling sorry for them and/or wanting to slap them into some sense.Tenny is one of the best troubled kids I've read about. She's obviously fond of Ellen but knows that her mom wants her to hate her would-be stepmom, so moves from occasionally loving behavior to acts of outright nastiness in the blink of an eye. She's a less homicidal bad seed, and we're not sure if we really WANT Kenneth and Ellen to get custody of this kid: sure, it would be better for the child to be with them, but it's unclear whether life with this kid is actually survivable.Ellen has a clear, funny, insightful voice, and we believe her complicated relationship with her lover, who's a bit of a doormat. This book is truly engaging and entertaining: it's a light book with a deceptively deeply felt center."
4,"Attend Class Every Day, Read Your Chem Book Ahead of Time...","... and then, and only then, should you give Standard Deviant's Chemistry a look. First, the topics and the way they are covered is pretty basic. Second, not much is said in regards to the most common mistakes that chem students make (not reffering to Kelvin temp. in terms of degrees and Sig. Figs. are mentioned.) Third, the Deviants are somewhat distracting but hilarious nonetheless. But overall, these are excellent review and supplemental aids for they help impress upon you what is critical, but only slightly effective on their own and by themselves. Good luck with Chemistry!"
3,Good but a little cheesy,"My kids are 16 and 19. The younger one thought there was no redeeming value and that it was more appropriate for a 10 year old. Well, 10 is a bit young for this video.The basic chem info is in here. Lots of odd hype in the telling--reminded me of the old Monty Python, without the crudeness.Bottom line, if you need a quick overview and aren't bothered by the distracting ""try to be fun"" presentation, it is worth buying. If you think the subject needs more serious contemplation, it is definitely not for you."
5,FUNNY! Explains the subject matter very well.,"Makes chemistry very entertaining. Remember, sigma does not equal beer!"
5,Just Perfect for My Purpose,"I placed my round Aurelle rechargeable candle on a square glass and rattan table in our atrium for the holidays and surrounded it with gold tinsel garland and golf ball sized gold and red ornaments. It looks beautiful (and like a real candle) but much safer than a live flame. I am VERY pleased with the results.SLC, Sedona, Arizona"
3,unreliable out of the box,"When I finally got some of them to work, they work great and look great. Unfortunately, they are unreliable out of the box: 30 to 70% of them need to be replaced to work. GREAT concept, just needs to be reliable."
3,its okay...,works well but doesn't seem to hold a charge for very long. Its okay but i prefer the real thing.
2,Margaret VS. David,"I read this book after watching ""Shine"" and became enthralled with the life of David Helfgott. I have to say that although Margaret feels the need to have to defend her father, she blatantly disregards her brother's feelings. The way one person perceives a behavior, may be perceived a different way by someone else. There are no right or wrong answers when dealing with emotions. It's not a matter of ""he said/she said."" Margaret may have perceived a father's love for his child when Peter worked with David. However, David may have perceived Peter as abusive, controlling, and dominating."
4,Be sure to read this one!,"This remarkable memoir is truly absorbing, dealing as it does with issues from the movie ""Shine"", subtle antisemitism, cynical use of Holocaust symbols, misdirected blame against a father caring unstintingly for a mentally ill child, and the unbelievable ""Shine Study Guide"", published as a pseudo-academic document, but proving itself to be an outrageous example of media exploitation. I bought this book wanting to know more about the endearing musician, David Helfgott. I have come to the conclusion that he benefitted from a supportive family and many friends who helped him constantly along the way, contrary to what has been implied by the film. I recommend this book to others like myself who are ""turned off"" by a ruthless desecration of the truth by the film mega-buck industry in the name of ""art""."
5,Not just David Helfgott. Thanx to Margaret and Peter Helfgott.,"This true story of the Helfgott family touched my heart, especially Peter Helfgott. Sometimes I think of him as my father in-law. (sigh) I wish I could go back in time and see the entire Helfgott family. Why you ask? I was introduced to the Helfgotts by watching the movie Shine, and learning about the real life of this book."
3,A little deceptive.,"While you could certainly consider this to be a cookbook of ""festive baking,"" to say that it's ""with whole grains"" is a bit of a stretch.The recipes call for whole wheat flour, true, but also unbleached (processed) flour. You'll find oat, rye and buckwheat recipes, but not many. What the author means by his subtitle is really ""festive baking with a little whole wheat.""There are better cookbooks for cooking with whole grains. However, Haedrich does offer more dessert recipes in this book than you will find in most whole grain cookbooks. That is the reason why I am keeping my copy, and not taking it to a used book store."
4,better than loving family,"why (buy) loving family when you can get this ,it's the same thing ,portable (...)"
5,life long toy enthusiast,I am sooooo in love with this charming village. My girlsspend hours play with the whole town. (there ages are3 and 5) This country home is full of some many well thoughtout details. There's even a door for the dog. If your thinkingthat sounds so cute.(your right) The price is right. and yourchildren can have a chance to play without batteries.
5,"love it, love it, love it!","I actually bought this at a garage sale for $2.00, but would have paid full price for it. My 5 1/2 year old daughter Lucy, and 3 1/2 year son Isaiah absolutely love this house. They have played with it every single day since I bought it, 3 weeks ago!They use their imagination and keep entertained for about 1/2 hour to 45 minutes. that is a big deal around here.it's great!!!!!!!!"
3,inappropriate illustration,"I have purchased the loving family sweet streets items for my five granddaughters forever. The toys are wonderful, sturdy and provide hours of imaginative play for the girls and me. However, a little more thought to your illustration for the country house is in order. It would be much better if the father were not in the bathroom while the mother is in the bathtub and the child alone in the living room. How nice if Dad were reading to the child while Mom relaxed alone for a few minutes."
5,Alsaskan Earthquake,This work gives a good overview of the huge Alaskan earthquake of 1964. The extent of damage both physical and mental was amazing for those trying to deal with it after effects.
3,Tweezerman Mousetache Scissors with Comb,"The scissors is quite good and the comb would have been, except that it had packaging tape on it with glue that would not come off. The comb continued to stick to my moustache and beard, became useless and had to be discarded."
5,Cuts and combs... yep!,"Not much to say... The scissors work like they ought to, and the comb performs as well as you can expect for a comb. No reason to remove stars in my opinion."
3,Scissors are great,The scissors are everything that you would expect from Tweezerman and more. The comb wasn't worth the additional cost. It bends and will not stand up to mustached hair. Maybe it was meant for a ladies mustache rather than a mans.
1,Not sharp at all.,"What's going on here? Bought these because of the rave reviews. While not badly constructed, these scissors have no edge. They pull my mustache instead of trimming it. The little comb is really nice, but the scissors are a joke."
1,Don't waste your money.,The jacket is clearly a second. It had a terrible smell and the cut was not correct - the front of the jacket was much shorter than it should have been. I've returned it for a refund which I'm still waiting for.
1,Not a 2012 jacket,"The cost to send this jacket back was over $15. This is not a 1012 jacket, my guess would be at least 2009."
1,Not a Timex!,"I ordered a Timex Indiglo travel alarm clock and instead I received an Elgin. I did not receive what I paid for. On the other hand - it works. The screen has small numbers and, when opened, it is not angled enough so it is hard to read the time."
1,Don't buy this clock!,"For years I had a wonderful analog Timex Indiglo travel clock. It was simple, durable, easy to travel with. It was also very forgiving of being accidentally knocked to the floor because invariably the stand would separate from the clock, but it never broke. I could always put it back together, using the 2 little tabs on the stand.This new clock is bigger, has features I don't want, has switches that are hard to use and is constructed, both stand and clock, out of one piece. I can already tell that if this one falls to the floor enough times, the stand/cover will break. No little, forgiving tabs on this model!Also, although I ordered a Timex, the one that I'm reviewing is labeled Elgin.Ah well. I should have bought two when I realized how wonderful the old one was."
2,received the wrong clock,"I ordered an Indiglo travel alarm clock and received an Elgin instead. The Elgin is hard to set because the control buttons are so small and hard to read. Also, the Elgin has many more settings and gives more info than I need. I wanted just a travel alarm clock and don't need one with the date, temperature, etc. I have had Indiglos before and liked them.I would like to know if I may return this Elgin for the Indiglo that I ordered and paid for. If so, how do I go about doing this?"
1,Don't bother if you need an alarm clock,"This clock is a joke. The alarm is so low you'd need to have it on your pillow to hear it, and even then you might not. The clock also runs fast. The only good thing is the size of the display, which is large. So, I use it in the bathroom because it's pointless for a travel alarm clock, unless you want to miss all your meetings."
5,"lovely scented, gentle on skin","I was looking for a new delux soap to try and decided to order it. I started to use it today. My mom is visiting, she used it and took the rest of two soaps from me. Wonderful fragrance, cleans well, very gentle. I will order it again. Price is affordable for periodic pumpering."
4,Good inexpensive single camera bag with room for some extras...,"Inexpensive somewhat comfortable lighter weight bag, with decent enough light padding and firm stiffening. In it's main compartment it will hold a Nikon D70 (fairly tight tho, prolly better with a D40?) camera with an 18-55mm lens attached to it and a 35mm lens in a padded compartment underneath this. Also in a pinch I was able to put my 75-240 zoom in it's outside pocket, but be aware there's no padding on this outside pocket.It's not discreet, it does look like a camera bag, and it's not narrow enough to conform to your body like a messenger bag so it does stick out a bit on your hip. But as a quick throw-on bag for when I want to go out and photograph locally with not a whole lot of gear along, I find it's a very good inexpensive combination of protection and lightweight portability!Greywoulf"
5,Awesome camera bag!!,"I bought this bag to hold my Canon rebel Xsi w/ grip and 17-55 IS with lens hood and some other accessories and it fits perfectly! It is a great bag for those who only want to carry just their body and one lens. It may fit two lenses if you have a relatively small lens attached to the body. The front pocket is pretty big and is big enough for me to put my 85mm prime lens in it. I only have one complaint and that is the shoulder strap not being padded, but it's fine it works. Other than that it's truly a good bag for the price."
4,Great for all situations,The bag was everything i could have hoped for. It's light and allows easy accessibility to my camera.
3,Yes and No,I bought this bag yesterday but a bit disappointed because my 450D + Battery grip are a bit tight in here. Otherwise it seems to be a nice bag
5,Tough bag,"I'm not sure about the 2 camera description for this bag, I got it because I've a telephoto and a shorter lense and didn't want two bag's for one camera when I switch lenses. With my EF 70-300mm lense on my 400D XTi it fit's great. Just right. I've also a Cannon ET-65B hood but you'll have to turn it around. Still fits fine. Figure the inside depth at a maximum 9 1/2"" for your cam and telephoto on. It's got a strap that go's with, a wide belt loop and a nice wide handle on the lid. A zippered lid and I'm not real sure about how water proof they are. Theres a little 3""x6"" pouch inside the lid. Theres also a 4""x4"" loose pad and I use that to lay over the cam's LCD. Good value for the price. It's not junk!"
4,Great price and greatly improves performance,I had a check engine light on my 1998 Jaguar. Car was riding rough. Scanned and found I needed new O2 sensors. I bought these- had them delivered - installed and no check engine light- car runs great!
4,A refreshing sound of soft french rock.,"Such a beautiful voice on 10 very suitable songs of love, solitude, and a little ""gucci-gucci""! (C'est chaud).I cannot think of anyone to compare her to. Her voice ranges from a whisper to a small rap in the middle of ""C'est chaud"". Very unique and a favorite."
2,Say cheeeeese,"It starts out well with Le Yaya, T'avoir à mes ctés, C'est chaud and Comme j'ai toujours envie d'aimer which are all great, but then...WOAH. Craporama of ballads, all cheesier than the next. Her absolute worst album."
3,Could have been better,"There are a few songs one this CD that really get u pumpin, but Reggae Hits Vol.1 is better.YOu will be dissapointed with the songs they actually put on this CD. It's supposed to be a reggae! Tight up Skirt and such songs like dat are only worth it. You best be putting Your money elsewhere."
4,The most important part of any Jerry Jeff Walker collection.,"Any red-blooded Texan ( or those who want to be ) knows the words to ""Redneck Mother"" and the following ""London Homesick Blues"". Add to that the classic ""Mr. Bojangles"" and you have the definitive JJW album. The recording quality is superior to many other JJW offerings, but still has the ""ice-house sound"" that comes from the juke box at 1:30 am. This is the one...The cover should hang in a place of honor in the Capitol in Austin, with a map below giving directions to Terlingua."
4,"URBANE, URBAN COWBOY","Sometimes you just need some old-fashioned rock and rolling, comboy style. That is the roots too. If you, like I do, every once in a while need to hear about whiskey bars, fly-by-night hotels, pool playing hustlers, sad-eyed gals, flossies, no-name susies, broken-down cowboys, low down hotels nighttimes smells, guys saying what the hell at the last chance motel you have come to the right address. Listen on."
3,Motorola RAZR V3 Black Phone,The model is good enough to talk and even to take pictures.But if you by any chance remove the battery cover you might have problem putting it back. i am serious.
1,Buy Sony Products,Buy Sony Products if yo don't want your system damaged. I bought other brands and my PlayStation does not work anymore
1,Disappointed.,I was really disappointed. I was advised by the seller that the tape was lost in the mail.
1,film expired in 2009.,"Are you kidding me, Amazon selling expired film on their web site, I can't believe they would do this and they put a ticker over the date too. I just hope it stll works because it isn't worth my time to send it back."
1,HORRIBLE GAME,I rented this game and I think it was the wrost 5 dollars I've ever spent in my life. I would never even consider buying this game after playing it for only a few minutes. I would have never even rented it if i knew it was going to be this horrible. The graphics are horrible and are no better than hockey games on ps1. This game gives a bad name to ps2 and all great sports games.
1,"Rent first, then buy if you like","I'd avoid this game at all costs, or if you need to make a decision for yourself, spend the few bucks and rent first to see how bad this game is.The game has absolutely no improvements in graphics over NHL Faceoff 2000 for the old PlayStation. I honestly thought I put the old PS1 game into my PS2, it was *that bad*.The announcers are usually 4-5 seconds behind what's actually happening on the ice.The announcers talk about the NJ Devils losing the playoffs last year, when they won the cup--shows how the only thing ""up-to-date"" about the game is the pricetag.It's so bad, I'll never purchase another ""989 Sports"" product, no matter how good it is."
1,NHL FACE OFF 2001,THIS GAME SHOULD BE AN EMBARASSMENT FOR SONY AND 989. THE PS ONE VERSION IS ACTUALLY BETTER. DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$ ON THIS ... I'M SENDING MINE BACK TO SONY.
2,"Horrible game, worse season",I just wanted to let everyone know that the season mode in NHL Faceoff is the worst. It is not interactive and there is no strong points to it. It is just horrible. The game is weak and to easy to score. The arenas however look are very lifelike they show great detail. Mario is in the game but the announcers do not say his name since he was a last minute add on.My advice buy NHL 2001 and don't encourage 989 sports to make games like this one
2,"Fun, maybe but too easy","I love NHL games on a console. I own almost every hockey game for a console except for Dreamcast games. I found this game very easy. The first game I played I won 22-1. Then I turned on Arcade mode and the difficulty to All-Star, then I beat the San Jose Sharks with the Dallas Stars 15-2. The game was at it's maximum difficulty with five minute periods and I still scored 15 goals. It's a great game if you like blowout wins."
4,It warms up my house,"Since my current house has no fireplace, I bought 2 copies of this DVD and played them on my 40"" and 50"" TVs during the Christmas festivites. My guests were amused and impressed."
3,"Alkaline batteries not enough, Lithium or Ni-MH needed.",This is a decent camera with poor instructions / information / design with regard to the battery. Good alkaline batteries don't last a whole day in this camera. Lithium batteries work but need to be replaced more often than in most cameras. The best thing for this camera is to buy Ni-MH rechargeable batteries. Take the batteries out when not using the camera and recharge them often.
2,D-100 Reliability,"I bought a D-100 in September 2001 and althought it takes great pictures It's been back for repair twice. First with the 1E10 error and then because of shading on the left side of the pictures. I'm beginning to think this model is ""Snake Bit""."
4,Great little camera !,"... for the price, it's the best camera I've ever owned. I use window's xp, it hooked right up with no new software. It rocks !"
3,OK For Everyday,If I had it to do over again I would have bought a camera with a higher pixel count. This camera is great for everyday snapshots but falls short if you want to take sports or action pics. The flash takes forever to recharge and the delay for autoflash is just stupid slow. The digital zoom is pretty worthless since the pixel count is so low. A great deal if all you do is take the family snapshots at holidays.
1,MY NEW OLYMPUS D100,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD CAMERA,ITS EASY TO USE AND UNDERSTAND.VERY EASY AND FAST TO PRINT PICTURES. ITS JUST A NUMBERONE CAMERA ALL THE WAY."
1,D-100 -- skip it! They have short life spans,"My D-100 was, for 1 month, a total joy. Then it turned belly up for no reason whatsoever... dead. Wouldn't power up at all. Tech recommended letting it sit without batteries for a full 24 hours so it would return to factory default settings. Didn't bring it back to life. This camera was handled with such extreme care that one might say I went overboard. And it died anyway. As for battery life, it went fine for days and days and days, 100s of shots on 2 NicM AA rechargable batteries. That is until it died. I went to the Olympus forum on D-100s. Nothing but horror stories and tales of woe. Skip it. Get something else. Waste of nearly $200."
5,Wrong adapter is suggested,"I'm certainly not a professional photographer, but I really like this camera and the pictures I've takes so far.The power adapter they recommend is not the one that goes with it, you don't want the c-7au. You want the E-7au. At least that's what the folks at Olympus told me. Will know soon..."
3,Great camera-if you can find batteries,"I recently purchased the D-100, based on various positive reviews listed on this page. I purchased this camera specifically for an extended trip. The camera works great and the quality of the pictures is excellent. However, when the battery (provided with purchase) was no longer good, I could not find a replacement. Stores such as Wal-Mart and Target, who carry this product, don't carry the batteries. I searched for a replacement battery within a 500 mile radius, but no luck. As a result, I was unable to take pictures that I will never be able to get again. I intend to contact Olympus directly to bring this marketing problem to their attention. It appears that Olympus makes it intentionally difficult to locate replacement (one-time use) batteries, requiring consumers to purchase their batteries and charger for $60.00."
3,"Digital Camera for the ""Novice""","This camera seems to be a pretty good choice for someone new to digital photography. The price is reasonable and it has all the basic features. It is very easy to download pictures to the PC via the USB cable. The only complaint that I have so far (I have only had the camera for 1 week) is that the documentation is not user-friendly. I had to call customer service to find out how to use the USB download. Their Customer Service Technician provided excellent support. The software instructions that come with the camera do not address the D-100 model download. They have added the instructions to their web site. Overall I think this is a good choice for the ""novice"" that doesn't want to spend a lot for a digital camera."
2,Olympus D-100,"I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now.I also have a Fuji Finepix-1400 that I have had for about15 months. The olympus is not even close to the quality thatcan be achieved with the Fuji. The color is not easy to get right with the Olymous. Also, you don't get a users manualwith the Olympus until you print out 104 pages on your printer.Not easy for a novice to figure out."
1,Bad Battery life,This was also one of the first cams I brought. I purchased this camera around the first of December and with in a week the battery was dead. I have not been able to locate the battery that fits this camera and I am very disappointed with this product. The pictures were good for what I needed it for posting pictures to websites but don't be too far from your subject.
5,Works for my purposes.,"I wanted to get a record player solely to play my old jazz records and some reggae vinyls I had. Produces the sound well, and the speed adjustment is a nice feature. It's sleek design is also appealing to the eye. Worth the buy."
1,does not fit newer GM cars,"It says it fits most gm ford and chrysler. However, it does not fit a lot of newer gm cars including my car. You might need extra legs such as KD Tools 3510 Steering Wheel Pulling Legs for your car if your car is gm and later than 1997. I had to run to a store for two extra legs and they cost me about $30. Make sure before you buy."
5,"GREAT STORY, enjoyable read!","I LOVED LOVED this story and it was the best book I read last year. Although it involves some serious issues, it's told by a man who recalls the story from his 12-year-old self years before. Since it's told by a young boy, impressionable, and desperate to learn about the world around him, it was fascinating to see how this boy learns, interprets people's actions and grows. I learned a lot about Montana, a place I've never been and probably won't go, but it gave me a clear picture and placed me in a different, interesting time in a smalltown with family issues/history. It's a great, relatively short read that you'11 greatly enjoy!"
3,Hhmmm...,"Well I found the first chapter drawing me in, of course this was after he ranted about every little detail of the town - that kinda bored me. Then after chapter one I wanted to know what happens, but it was a bit of an anti-climax. Anyway besides the book being a bit dull, it was quite easy to read."
2,"Little plot, no conclusion.","In my opinion, Montana 1948 is a dull book with little to offer a reader.As 12-year-old David Hayden's father investigates the claims of molestation of young Indian women, he discovers a secret about his uncle that threatens to tear the family apart. Despite the promising story line and the author's wonderful writing style, the book falls to peices.It had a semi-suspenseful plot that ended in a letdown with no resolution. Nothing gets solved and the events that have occured eat away at the Hayden family until David's father and grandfather die of cancer.I don't reccomend this book."
2,Montana 1948,"I have three qualms with this book:1. The characters become so painfully annoying over the course of it's 175 pages that, by the time the story has completely unfolded, we just don't care about what happens or might happen to them.2. The book takes the moral highground. This is perhaps it's greatest flaw; the narrator, David, is painfully opinionated on all that surrounds him. I know this is something that can never be completely avoided in a first-person narrative, but it could have been handled with a lot more grace than what Larry Watson has done here.3. The story is uninteresting. Not meaning to belittle Larry Watson's talent as a writer, because he certainly has a knack for descriptions of people and place, but we simply don't care about the majority of the events that unfold.Read something else; save yourself from boredom and disconnection."
2,Far Too Repetative,"It took a long time before any action to acumulate in Larry Watson's novel. I resented spending two hours of my time reading this book beacuse the novel could have conveyed the same message in 50 pages. I felt the writing was very simplistic contrary to other novels on family relationships and moral dilemas. A very easy read, avoid if possible."
5,Montana 1948,This is a very good book that gives a person a lot to think about.The book arrived in a timely manner and in the shape that I expected.
5,Montana 1948,"Montana 1948 is a wonderful book, telling what probably happens even today. It explains why Indian populations may not trust white people. This book was discussed in our book club. I bought a copy, and I bought another copy for our library so everyone could read it."
1,Not Satisfied!,"I am absolutely not satisfied with my item. When I ordered the item, it did not come in the time that was stated, it came a month later! Also the item doesn't anything like the picture. It is also drawn on, written on, and torn."
1,BAD,"This was probably the longest most uninteresting book in the world with random pointless metaphors and rediculous motifs that I felt sick throughout the entire novel. Just another, I know whats right but what to do, books. If there was a possible negative star this would get it. If number the stars wasn't a book this would be the worst one."
1,Boring,"I didn't really like Montana 1948, because it was a boring book. Reading this book was very not a positive experience for me because uncle Frank was child molester and always with the Indians especially with one Indian named Marie Little Soldier. I didn't like this topic at all.The characters in this book are all dumb, especially David's dad because he doesn't believe what they said of uncle Frank. I don't think he should be like that. I think my favorite character was nobody. The author did a good job on creating the characters I just don't like the book.I don't think the author made this book very interesting. Because it only talks about uncle Frank's crime, and how she rape Marie Little Soldier.I don't recommend this book because is really a boring book and I don't think people want to read boring books."
1,Wow what a boring book,It seemed like larry watson didn't know what he was doing. He foreshadows every little event through the wind. Its filled with so many stupid meaningless symolisms and metophores. This book has one theme and thats RETARTED
4,Larry Watson Scored With Montana 1948,"Simply put, this is a wonderful story that will keep you turning the pages and craving for more."
5,"My boys say: ""Cool!""","""This is pretty good"" from two middle school boys is a terrific review for a foreign language book. It's best with the cassette tape so you can practice correct pronunciation. Packed full of useful vocabulary and phrases, this book's cartoon drawings and mystery story glide you easily yet thoroughly through French grammar. Great for middle school through adult - best we've found."
3,???,Who releases a CD under Cannonball Adderley's name - but puts a photo of his brother Nat on the front cover?!?!?
1,Way to0 expensive for four cups,$15 for four cups is an awfully steep price. I misunderstood the four pack thinking it meant four packs of four cups (16 cups total). I paid $14.99 for four cups. If you go to Target these cups are under a dollar per cup. Not happy at all with the price of this purchase.
5,Don't plan to toss for a while!,"Only had them a few days, but I am loving these!! Five cups for less than the price of a regular sippy, and they so far haven't leaked a drop! Same cannot be said for all the other types we have (playtex, etc) with the valves, they always leak! I'm sure these will break down over time, but for now, they are a great, cheap replacement to our normal sippy cups and my daughter is loving them! Plus, they take up less space in the cupboard!"
3,Ok Cup,"Its ok for the money. But the holes are too small, guava juice doesnt flow well. Since there is only one cover, doesnt help if the kid is a biter like my son. Not too bad overwise.. I have had them for 4 months now."
3,Low Flow,Had to make the hole in the lid larger for my son to get anything out of it. This is definietly a cup for older toddlers.
1,Not spill proof,"I am not happy with these cups as every time my son, who is 12 months, gets the lid to come off. Will be getting new ones."
2,"Wow, what a piece of crap....","Cute toy, its actually still in the box as its a christmas gift, but I will say it will last maybe 10 minutes before it sustains major damage. Flimsy, and I mean FLIMSY plastic. I can take the door and move it in almost a complete circle as the plastic is so cheap. Same with the helmet. I'd return it right off, but I know my son will love it, but if I had seen it before I bought it, it never would have come home with me."
5,For every age!,"I gave this book to my son for his 20th birthday and he loved it. It is a pure and simple message of unconditional love! It tells your son that no mater what happens in life, you will always love them just the way they are! A message we all need to hear from our parents :)"
5,"This book is a fun excuse for cuddles, kisses and telling your little one how much you love them","I only bought this book because it was on sale, and I'm so glad I did! I have also bought copies for my niece and nephew since. This book gives you an excuse to cuddle with your little one while you tell them you love them - but not in a corny way. I was surprised at how much my little girl (16 months) loves looking at the pictures. This is one of her favorites to read again and again, and it has the ""I love you"" theme, but it is not too repetitive to read again and again. She will also ""read"" it to herself paging through and looking at the pictures"
1,Only got half the product!!,Said audio and I only got the book which was old and used. The Words in the book are really cute. Has a nice story.
5,Love this book!,"This is one of my little boy's favorite bedtime books. It's perfect for 3-5 year olds, it's a thin, easy read with just one sentence per page. The illustrations are simple but wonderful. And best of all, this book imparts the message every mommy wants to send to her little one(s), that they are loved no matter how they feel or what they do. Keep in mind, this is strictly a mommy book, there is no daddy fox to be seen, but my little boy's father still enjoys reading this book to him. A great buy!"
4,Esoteric Disco,"Don't expect to have heard most of these songs before (it's not an overview disco collection). As Larry Levan collections go, this one is a little more gay-bar-esque than the others, by which I guess I mean thumping and upbeat. I just got this one and it hasn't grown on me yet; I really like his Taana Gardner songs, which aren't included. Still any Larry Levan is good in my opinion so if you feel the same you should get this one too."
3,My grandma likes it...,It's an ok game for my grandma but I like more shooters and action games so this game wasn't exactly for me.
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for tools that can open the back of my ladies watches so I can replace the battery myself. But the various knives that came in this set are not thin enough to go in the space between the back plate and the watch. For the watches that has slots on the back plate, the tiny screwdrivers in this set are not small/thin enough to go in either. Disappointed."
3,So-So,"I did manage to use the tools for some of the watches - but I found that after the first batch, the tool got dull and I could no longer lift the backs off the watches anymore. I guess for the price it was okay."
4,Decent set,Has successfully opened all the watches I wanted it to. I am very happy with the set for the price I paid.
1,Watch tool for replacing battery,Very poorly made and does not work properly and comes with no instructions. Could not remove cover to replace battery
2,Not what I thought,Although it did not come with instructions I figured I would try the watch opener items that were straightforward but when I tried using them they did not open the watch back. Wasn't impressed so I ended up sending it back.
3,"Cool set, not what I was looking for.",This is a very cool set and can be used for many things but not to open the back of ladies watches. The reason I bought it was for one tool and it was too thick. Now I have to pay someone to do something I could do.
2,Junk,"After purchasing and my first review, I tried using each tool. Not one single tool worked like it was supposed to. They are junk. Don't bother. A fine example of you get what you pay for...pay a really cheap price, get a really cheap product."
5,Cool single!,"This is their third Australian single and it probably gonna do great! Although it hasn't debuted it a cool dance track, so you can hit the dancefloor with it! The vocals are great, music is great and the clip is great. Overall it's GREAT! 5 OUT OF 5!"
3,Who's In Charge Here?,"Young people today will appreciate a few of the photos, but most of them will not be understood. I remember these books vividly, but even I cannot identify a few of the people. I can't help thinking that events of recent years, particularly in politics, would provide plenty of excellent subject matter for something like this today."
4,"If you do not understand the context, you will not find these images funny","The books in this series are good for a few laughs but they age very quickly. The basic form is to take a photo of a famous person and then insert a caption of text that makes a joke. However, once you have read the book and chuckled as you turned the pages, going back over it before your memory fades will almost certainly bore you. Furthermore, if you read it two decades later like I did this one, you must have a good memory for the events and people to get the jokes. I found it funny and a reminder of some of the silliness of the American presidential election of 1992, but that could not be repeated."
4,It Grows On You.,"This is an excellent horror film.I liked it very much.The juxtaposition of witchcraft,mesmerism, parasitic infectionand possessing spirit is a great themeand it is realized well.The music and colors createa lot of spooky atmosphere.There are moments of great tensionand some cringe induction.There is a little gore as well.Just enough.Creepiness too.The acting is quite good.I particularly appreciate the charactersbehaving as mature adultswhich is somewhat of a rarityin horror films.For a scary movie good time,""Parasite"" will not disappoint."
3,"""Interesting"" but not ""good"".","I found this book less brilliant than his previous title ¡Emotional branding¡. Gobe is simply repeating himself in a loosely knit 10-chapters format. There are many interesting case studies, but the author does not focus them tight enough to make those examples relevant to the chapter title. For instance in chapter 2 he talks about trust and cause marketing, but he cannot solidly tie the two together; as trust does not always equal well-carried cause marketing campaigns, what IS trust in terms of branding? What are the mechanisms of ¡trust¡? I think he should give us a global definition before diving into the subject.There are numerous examples of such poorly related text in the book, I would advise you to read his first book ¡Emotional branding¡ and skip this one."
4,great looks,the watch is stunning in its looks. especially if you like the black colour. its been 3 months and I havent had any problems. But somehow i see some problem in the time accuracy...when I compare it with my quartz watches - it seems it gains time and that too in a pretty arbitrary manner. however I havent had to adjust it till date.
5,pure aweomeness,This is so great.any body wh lies death metal eve a little bt shuld own this.eveyting about it rules.buy it you womt regret it
4,Very Good,"This is an excellent box set for the price. Cannibal Corpse certainly isnt for everyone, but those who appreciate technical,tight, loud death metal cant go wrong with this set. Lots of good studio versions of their best songs and some nice rarities and demoes to go along with a poster (mine was autographed but some of the newer ones are not), a really cool booklet and a CC guitar pick make this a really great box set to have. Some of the songs on the DVD are of rough quality but its still cool to see them way back in the begining playing live."
5,Stupid people,Corpse-grinder is a talented vocalistWebster is a god on bassOwens writes awesome riffsNice straight forward drummer...stupid people...notice the talent...even if you don't like the music
1,Not Impressed,This video is terrible. It doesn't teach how to really move like they do you have to learn how to move that way on your own at the risk of looking rediculous!
2,Dancing Diva!,"I was so excited when I recieved this DVD but not too happy when I played it. The workouts were far beyond my experience. When I saw ""beginners,"" I expected it to go step by step and slowly. I was not expected to jump right into the moves and expected to be able to move like that! I was wondering was there a begining tape for the beginners?!? I saw a bunch of women just moving to music at their own beat. It was like, ""look at me and what I can do and you can't!"" If you are younger, then you probably can handle it."
1,waste of time and money,"I did not purchase this item. I borrowed it from the public library with the idea that if I liked it, I would order my own copy. I am so glad I did not pay money for this. The ten minute quickies start out with no warmup - very dangerous. The hip hop seems like regular exercise and the belly dance is not good. If you don't know how to bellydance it wouldn't help you and if you do, you would know to warm up first and would be better off just playing music and dancing your own steps for 10 minutes."
2,Not what I expected,I think I should have researched this better. Too hard and not what I was looking for.
1,Don't waste your money or time on this DVD,I would not recommend this product to anyone. The hip hop dance workouts were a joke. It was just MaDonna Grimes repeating squats. Last I heard dancing involved a little more than that. I also perused through some of the belldance routines. If you can do isolated buttocks sqeezes your good to go. I'm not familiar with bellydance and did not find this to be very instructional for beginners. The routines were boring. I guess I'm not the best reviewer because I didn't watch the DVD all the way through. I was enraged after the first 20 minutes and had to turn it off before I punched something. WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!
2,Disappointed,I purchased this DVD mainly for the Hip Hop sections. I was very disappointed to find out there is no Hip Hop dancing on this DVD. Madonna Grimes is the instructor for the Hip Hop section but it is basic aerobics and floor exercises.
2,Not for beginners,"If you want to move for 50 mins, then this is for you. If you are looking for bellydance instruction of any sort - absolutely NOT.The two MaDonna Grimes workouts are not hip hop, but do work your lower body and abs (in the 2nd of her workouts) quite well.Suhaila - yes a totally amazing dancer but the individual glute squeezes? C'mon, I've been bellydancing for 8 years and teaching for 3, and that is certainly not for beginners.Jayna's segment is lovely but I do have a comment about the Jayna and Rania segments. A beginner picking this dvd up and hoping it will give adequate bellydance instruction risks injury - movements like camels and chest isolations require a breakdown of the individual moves, not just ""do this"" - Rania's camels are ENORMOUS and I can imagine a few strained backs at the very least. Thank the gods for a the disclaimer!As I say, if you want 50 minutes of movement go for it, but please do not rely on this for bellydance instruction of any sort."
4,WOW ! ! !,"This was the BEST book thatI read all year!It is more than just another sex,drugs, and money book,Its more! When sahi came home from college hae learns that his brother Tommy is helping his farther with their family drug business. now he wants to help but his farther wants him to stay focused on school and basketball. this book will keep you capative and takes you for a wiold ride through shai's hood. With every trun of the page you will be amazed how this book is sooo close to anyones true life experience."
4,there should have been more,this was a good book but for as long as it was it should have been more to it i think it could have ended in a better way there should have been more focus on the end after the youngest son took over !
1,sounds familar,after reading this i realized this book sound like a black version of the godfather...u know king pin father dies and the son has to take over even though he dosent want to but does it anyway.you could just watch the movie to see what this book is about
1,Why am I paying a dollar for 7 minutes?,Why am I paying a dollar for 7 minutes? Shouldn't they have put at least 30 minutes of cartoon together and charged you $1.99 or so for it. This is a rip off. You guys are charging way too much and reminds me of the Apple Store.
4,Tom and Jerry,Really good for kids my grandchildren watch them when they are with us. I would recomment them for your kids and grandchildren.
1,Too expensive for amt of time,"My 6 year old was very disappointed as was I, we paid 99 cents for 7 minutes. We really thought it would be at least 20 minutes. Too short for price paid, it should have been free or longer."
2,memory for xbox does not work,we purchased the memory for the xbox and it was stated that it was fo the xbox 360 but it does not fit into ou xbox so we cannot use it.
1,Memory card doesn't look new but was supposed to be,Memory card won't hold any new information. Looks like it has been used. Has multiple scratches on it and doesn't work. Was supposed to be a new memeory card. Very dissappointed since it was a Christmas gift and now is useless. Wasn't shipped be AMazon but another company which didn't include shipping slip so can't return it for a refund. Wouldn't suggest buying this item.
3,Necessary for Back Ups,"Stupid Microsoft. Man why did I even buy the 360 in the first place? Oh ya Star Ocean was Exclusive. Stupid Microsoft. To bad I can't back up my data with a USB device that the 360 has ports for. Oh wait is that because someone came up with the trophy ideal & we can't have cheeters now can we. Or was that already done before those updates came out? Anyways if you want to back your games up you need this little anoying device. That isn't included with your xbox 360. It's Microsofts way of saying thank you for buying our product, now go buy this one. I have no love for you Bill."
4,Great Condition,"Bought it used, game in the original plastic holder, though. Great condition. Delivery took quite a bit, but I blame the holidays. I bought this to use on another soldier's XBOX (I'm deployed, so I use his 360.)"
3,watch out for static electricity,"This 512MB Unit is great for saving your stuff if you have to share your xbox 360 or want to carry your file to a friend's house.It's overly price for a device with low memory storage, but still gets the job done. However, compared to other major electronic retailers, Amazon offers the best price for this unit.On another note, be cautious for static electricity as a result from rubbing your feet against the carpet, it can erase everything stored in it."
2,Needs to carry more space,"This is an okay product, but what really bites is that it doesn't hold what it says it does. It can only carry 467, or somewhere around there. Anyway, I'm tired, and I just wanted to let you know that some of them can't carry much."
1,x box,This was a gift to a child. I don't play these games I get the nessary things done around my home and stay active with my whole body not just my thumbs.The product I understand works and did arrive very qiuckly. thank you. G
5,Xbox 360 512 MB Memory Unit,"I am so glad I bought it. Is a great way to keep your XboxLive profile, game saves, and some Marketplace items portable. (I bought it so I can keep my game profile safe). I have been using it since 2009."
1,512MB memory units are now worthless,"I originally purchased this MU because I have multiple Xboxes and was tired of having to recover my profile every time I changed rooms. It was a poor product to begin with because of the 512MB limit and the restrictions that caused third-party MUs to not work. With the latest update to the Xbox dashboard it is an even worse option. You can now use USB thumb drives (limited to 16GB) instead of memory cards. This is a much better option for a few reasons:1. At the 16GB limit, you have 32 times as much space to save data to.2. You probably already have a thumb drive sitting around that is larger than 512MB.3. If you don't have a large thumb drive around, they are much cheaper per MB than the proprietary card.4. When schizophrenic MS decides to disable support for thumb drives (or enables external HDs), you will still have a thumb drive that is useful for other things.Skip this and use a thumb drive."
1,Obsolete!,This worked well for the old xbox 360 models but with the new Xbox Live updates it has become completely obsolete. You can buy a 2GB USB for about $10 that would work perfectly with your 360.
4,"Perfect for Xbox Live Arcade, but pricey memory card","This is the perfect device to save your purchased Xbox Live Arcade Downloads and take it anywhere with you. My only complaint is the price for one of these. At least it comes with the full version of Worms, which can become quite addicting."
3,Too expensive,"The memory unit is way over-priced. Why is .5 GB of memory so expensive when the cost per GB of memory today is pennies to the dollar? Unfortunately, the unit is absolutely necessary if you want to bring your profile to a friend's house without having to bring your entire Xbox.The free game that comes with it is lame (Worms)."
3,Did not fit...,I order this for my son Xbox 360 and it do not fit at all. So that was just a waste of money.
3,needs better descriptions if it can fit Xbox 360,description was not there was okay but I would prefer to let us know whether it goes for the Xbox regular or the xbox slim so next time maybe if make more description on what is kiss it and cannot fit it would be better for all and if it goes for the 360 regular than you to very good product but other than that it is not fixed the xbox slim I would not recommended.
5,Fantastic,"Perfect for game saves. I used this unit at first when i got my 360 and i have about 16 games of memory stored on there, and still have around 125 MB of free space. It really is overpriced at a major retail store, as such as any other 360 accessory. Buy online!"
3,What other choice did I have?,"The memory unit for the Xbox 360 from Microsoft is an excellent product, but way over priced. I bought this unit because I have had several 360's die and I lose my saved game files, so I needed a way to make backup's of the games that I'm playing. Frankly with all the problems with the 360's, Microsoft should include one of these with every Xbox instead of charging an outrageous price for so little memory. I can't give it 5 or even 4 stars because I feel like I've been forced to buy it, but overall it is a great product and I highly recommend it."
2,Xbox 360 Memory Cards,All Xbox 360 memory cards are now outdated since the Xbox Live update in March. You can now use USB flash drives (up to 16gb) to store data. I spent 30 dollars on a 512 mb card one month before the update came out. What a disappointment.
5,An truly accessible introduction to Krishnamurti,"I have been reading Krishnamurti for over 35 years. He is the sage to whom I turn when I need a simple, clear, and compelling understanding of reality. I recommend his books to many people, and yet I find that for most readers he is anything but simple, clear, and compelling. They find him hard to understand, and harder to apply to their daily lives.What Are You Doing With Your Life will change all of that. This is a ""threaded"" anthology of Krishnamurti's teachings on a variety of vital subjects compiled for teenagers. I bought it to help improve my own ability to mentor teens. What I found was so much more. Here is a clear, concise, and powerful articulation of Krishnamurti's deepest teachings. This is more than an introduction to his thought, this is the essence of his thought.I highly recommend this book to teens, their parents, and anyone else looking for love and silence at the heart of their everyday lives."
5,Krishnamurty's teachings condensed,"After having studied umpteen books from Krishnamurty, this is the one that seem to contain the nectar of what he undertook to convey. A 'must-have' for the beginners as well as for the already initiated. Organization of the text in sub-headings further adds to the charm and simplicity of the book. For someone yet to get acquainted with Krishnamurty, I recommend the reading of the ""Commentaries On Living"" series first. That would prepare a fertile foundation for Krishnamurty's teachings to reap in!"
5,the very good arguments on market socialism,"The author of this book has shown that market socialism would go to the dead end. China and Vietnam are not exceptional cases. Furthermore, by the approach of imperfect information, the arguments of the author against neoclassical and property theories are strongly persuadable to me.However, some political economy approach has not been mentioned in this book. I think this appproach is also useful to analyze the constraints on market socialism."
1,To err is human. To err this much is Stiglitz,"Although, as Stiglitz points out several times, capitalism is not perfect at transmitting information through the pricing system, he fails to demonstrate how state controlled firms could possibly do any better. He correctly observes that firms operate internally without a price system, but he also fails to observe that individual firms are small in comparison to the market, which is what allows firms to calculate how resources are used internally. This book is full of large errors and over simplifications of the regulatory and market process. However, if you're a serious socialist, it's the best book out there for you."
4,great fun,"great game, but there is a glich where your ship can run aground (really it just gets stuck) in map mode and you cannot get it back in the water. Fun if you can avoid this."
2,Not bad,"It's a good game overall, but the fight scenes are kind of lame. The multilayer is really cool with your friends. THe best thing about it is that it's one of the backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360 so you can play it on both consoles!"
3,I know it's a refurbed classic but...,"Of course all the things you can do are great ideas, but how you can do them and what you spend your money on gets old, fairly quick. The game progresses from real easy to difficult and the controls for swashbuckling are too limited for the type of increase in difficulty. The rest of the game play gets repetitious and the same old routines are too linear to retain their luster.Great for a rental, for sure!!"
2,Sid Meier missed the mark on this one,"Pirates! would have been good about 10 years ago. But the graphics are sub-par, the gameplay is terrible (swordfights are basicly a series of A A A X A A A), the story is hokey, and you spend most of your time doing missions which are carbon copies of the mission you just finished, the ship battles require more luck than actual talent and the trade system is flawed. I've enjoyed Meier's games since the beginning, when he relased the original Civilization, but this game if VERY lacking. I did get about 5 hours of gameplay out of it, but that was becaus I was waiting for something cool to happen, and it just never came."
3,XB Sid Meier's Pirates,"This is a good game however it grows tiresome very quickly. The gameplay although fun at first is very repetitive. There are a limited number of animations and cut scenes and the backdrops for the dancing, fencing, and battle minigames are the same every time with only slight variations. There are only so many times you can fence with an opposing ships captain, go to a port (all of which look exactly the same), sell the prize, and dance with the govoners daughter before it all starts to get old. The main game quest is also very repetitive. You chase the evil baron raymondo around repeating the exact same scenario 16 times in order to recover your missing family members. Also there are very few ship upgrades. Overall it is a good game that plays well but wares out quickly."
3,Better suited for collectors than for little girls,"This doll looks lovely in the box. Once you remove her from the box, her hair is shabby and matted in the back of her head. The wand stays in her hand only with a rubberband.The net overlay on the gown is unhemmed and ragged - a detail only detectable once Glinda is unboxed. Her arms are hinged at the elbows - an unusual characteristic for a Barbie doll.The Dorothy doll makes both a better display and play doll; her dress & hair have none of the shortcomings that diminish Glinda."
3,Lots of Hits Here,"Loveless 5th MCA release finds her in hit territory once again. Kostas' John Fogerty-inspired intro riff of ""Jealous Bone"" established new rock territory for Loveless and became her first hit from this effort. Since she was a rock vocalist for many years, it's a perfect fit here and ""Jealous Bone"" stretched the boundaries of modern-day country music. The retreating, countrypolitan ""Hurt Me Bad (In A Real Good Way)"" was a big hit which further solidified Loveless as a superstar. Perhaps the best moment from this CD is her version of Lyle Lovett's ""God Will,"" which comes awful close to his wry, cynical original version. Loveless compromises her bluegrass roots on this effort, nearly abandoning the stark, gritty instrumentation of her earlier efforts in favor of stringed arrangements on some songs. The result was increased CD sales, making MCA happy, but the tentative feel of ""Up Against My Heart"" leaves the listener wondering if Loveless was happy."
3,Prefer a Double Snap Method of Attachment,"The product is not too bad...PROSIt has plenty of snaps (3 male plus 2 female) to provide a wide range of adjustability. It will go from right at belt level to well below the belt when using the leg strap. I also like the fact that the leg strap is made entirely of elastic & that it has as quick release buckle on it.1 CONThe major thing that I do not like is that because of the placement of the male & female snaps, you can only snap one snap at a time. Call me paranoid, but I would prefer to be able to snap two snaps at a time just in case I brush up against something in the field & the snap comes undone. Granted you may have the extra security of the leg strap, but if the holster is snapped right at belt level then the leg strap cannot be used."
5,"""IF"" Bread made it to the 80's...","If you are a fan of the group Bread, and it's other ""star,"" JamesGriffin, you MUST get this rare, unappreciated gem! Released in1982 (apparently only in the UK)this album is FANTASTIC. TerrySylvester (of The Hollies) sort of becomes the ""new"" David Gatesas his voice is higher and sweeter than Griffin's, but oh the sweet harmonies! It truly does sound like a ""lost, 80's Bread lp."" This proves that what made Bread so special was NOT just Mr.Gates, but the blending of talents with the EQUALLY AMAZING,and charismatic Jimmy Griffin! I LOVE the song ""I'll Be There""Jimmy's vocals are so light and smooth, with flowing electric piano, and tasty sax work. This, and several other cuts shouldhave been BIG radio hits! There is no justice in the cruel musicworld. Rest in peace Jimmy Griffin, you were awesome as this cdclearly illustrates."
5,A Masterwork,"This book is a really fantastic overview and plot resource for the great operas up to 1947.Each opera is given 3-5 pages for a very thorough telling of the characters, plot, and elements of the orchestration that highlight the emotional impact and components, as well as mentioning the well known arias and duets from the work.This is a great tool for anyone who just wants to review an opera plot before seeing or listening to a performance. I have also found that this is the PERFECT bedtime reading book because you can read one opera plot a night... just the right length!"
4,Scenes from the opera,"Milton Cross is recognized as an authority on all scenes opera and has regaled his audiences for some thirty years on the Met Saturday Broadcasts. This book contains his selection of what is most noteworthy in opera settings and plots. I would wish for a more comprehensive book, but the current one is of great utility."
5,Versitile,"This is one of the best products in Stila's line... these provide perfect glowy cheek color. Some work better than others as lip color (rose and poppy)... the creamier ones (such as lillium and gerbera) can look a bit pasty on the lips, but even if you just use it as cheek color alone, these are well worth their price.I love the convertible colors too. I have four different ones and use them mainly as blushes, but sometimes as eye colors too. They are perfect for a sun kissed effortless look, and I used them everyday. I even will wear one hiking or to the beach, but without any other makeup on. Its a great cheek/skin enhancer."
4,Just as good second time around,"This is the second time I've purchased this product. This rarely happens with makeup. However, it is so convenient and works so well that I couldn't resist. I apply with my fingers or with a brush, over foundation or directly on my cheeks. Looks really natural, stays on all day. Also the case is great- it never breaks and the mirror is handy. This color in particular is very nice (I have a natural beige tone of skin). My last one of these lasted almost a year!"
1,"It's travel size, not original size.","It's travel size, not original size. You should be telling the truth to customers. You made ''me lose a lot of time."
3,Lillium is very light,I bought lillium awhile ago in a kit for light skin. While it was okay I was disappointed that is was so light on my lips. My lips are so much deeper than the blush that when I used it I looked like a had whitish pink lips. I needed lots of gloss to deepen the color. I think this particular shade looks like it has a hint of orange to it. It's not too noticeable unless you are wearing a true pink or your skin tone is pink. If you have fair skin to light skin with light pigment in your lips this should work well especially if you have an orange pink tone. It has the feel of lip stick but not as creamy. I also tried the camellia which was way too orange it also came in a kit a tried. I didn't like the color much on me especially with my light skin. Most people say I have cool tones in my skin but because my skin is light the colors in this kits are automatically warm. I do like some some of Stila's products but so far the blushes don't attract me.
4,Goes on smoothly,This blush is great. It goes on really smoothly even when you don't have time for moisturizer and full make-up underneath. The color is nice too.
3,lips,I love thi8s!!!!! I love the color and everything about this. You need a lip brush to apply and it would be nice if one was included but other than that you will enjoy it.
1,Horrible product!,Horrible product. Not at all what I imagined. Expensive and very cheap...like something you may find at a 99 cent store!
1,NO Stars. Absolute Drivel!Reviewer: Loves Thrillers,"This was the worst book I have read in years. The characters were cardboard, the plot was a joke, and the pop psychology seemed to have been lifted directly from a textbook. It was not even translated into the main character's voice, so it was glaringly out of sync with the rest of the text. I should have known something was off when I saw that there was only one review. Other readers, obviously shrewder than I, were smart enough to leave this one alone. Harriet, you disappointed me!"
3,Get longer bands,"The video is okay band training. I thought it would use two bands throughout, but only one section (the one on the cover) really used the two bands together effectively.Not a bad video. Cuing is fine. Just not what I was expecting."
3,big bands,The info on site gave the impression that there were two bands with the DVD but this wasn't the case and I had to spend $44 to buy them in a sports shop. The one hour session is pleasant and astutely judged to suit all levels. Steffanie is accompanied by her sister who is less sporty and a lissom young person who does everything at a higher level. Pick which one you follow. I did not like the music but it falls short of being outright annoying. Once you've learned the routine you can turn the sound down. Put your own stuff on. The tag line claims that you're getting twice the effect in half the time so I was hoping for a half hour routine to replace my one hour Pilates one but there is no time saving. I recommend it as a daily routine that is graceful and interesting but I do think the words are misleading.
2,Two true tracks,"Only for ultra-fans, favoring Brubeck's most pop-minded, vocal-driven work the most, though the far greater instrumental title track certainly does tease with talent."
3,Not as good as Star City Baby,"Being a Blow Pops fan, one has to get their sugar fix when they can. This cd as the last one demonstrates once again that Mike can still have a vulnerable cheeky style of writing. But once again some of his vocals seem strained and out of range for him.If you really wanted a full flavor of Mike at his best would be to get the Blow Pops cd American Beauties on Get Hip records. The Jarvis/Buckley writing team and vocals are bar-none one of the best guitar driven cds the 90s indie pop scene had offered. That cd was recorded at none other than Short Order Recorder and produced by one of the members of the Shoes."
3,A different twist for a Historial Novel,"Set in Egypt and in the desert is a different twist. I found I liked the people and enjoyed the culture. I thank the author for making me think about the differences and explaining the clothes, etc.Yes, the story had a few moments of stupid heroine, but overall it's enjoyable."
5,Missing hardware,The hook seems sturdy enough but there was no hardware supplied in order to attach it to one of my poles.
1,Not like the usual Christmas pudding,"Not fruity enough. Did not have the usual juicy, fruity taste. Would not recommend this Traditional Irish Christmas pudding or purchase again."
3,A useful reference,"This is a revision to my original review of this title. I initially stated that this book was pretty basic and is only good as a basic source for beginners. Though I no longer see my review posted.I've just again picked this title up to reference basic commands and their options. I find that it covers a lot of basic commands and how to best utilize these options.I also find that its coverage of the vi editor very good, amongst other things which I haven't really looked at.Therefore, I'm retracting my previous review and give this title a thumbs up. Good source for command line reference and how to use whatever version of Caldera included with it. Including installation, the X-window setup and other options.At the end of each chapter, it gives a summary of commands covered, their arguments and what they each do."
1,Pretty Lame,"This was a Christmas gift. I watched it with the recipient, who has a medical background, and found it to be very elementary. None of the more well-known areas were mentioned, such as Vitamin C megadoses and homeopathic medicine (admittedly a European and not American focus). I thought that this DVD would be good because I like the History Channel, but appears to be just an hour of interviews with a couple of interesting tidbits of trivia best directed to a high school level of understanding. It was inexpensive but still not worth the money."
4,Howard Keel,"...Now, about the CD.I've been a fan of Howard Keel for a long time. His movies and his music.There are only TWO songs on this CD that Mr. Keel actually performed in any of his movies. I was very pleased with those two songs. The rest are mostly modern and up to date songs, and although they are memorable songs, I was disappointed that the CD did not have more of his music/movie tunes on it. also, the CD I received would not play passed the 16th track so I can say whether the last four songs are any good.I still live Howard Keel, but I'd LOVE to see a compliation of his songs from his movies."
4,Outstanding Work,I read this work when it first came out in 1971. I have since rereaded it and I still find these ladies full of extraordiinary courage considering the time they had to live in. E. Mavor did a wonderful job depicting a relationship that lasted over fifty years. For easy and fun readinng I would recommend this book for any history buff.
1,Not a good product,"This product is very difficult to assemble. Each piece interlocks with another, and it is not lined up well. It does not slide in easily, and it takes a while to get each piece all the way in. When you do that, your fingers get hurt, and any other body part you use. It takes forever to do, and you need to put them together first then try to install in ground. There is no way to install them in ground. Horrible assembly, I gave mine away as shipping them back will cost too much, and the person that got them for free, is not sure they will have the patience to put them together. Also looks plasticy, which I know it is, but will probably look ok from far away.I do not recommend it."
5,Interesting,"I think this is a must have for anyone how is interested in knowing information, facts, myths on the Bermuda Triangle. I give this 5 STARS."
2,"Not great, but cheap","If you want to learn to speak Russian, this CD will not help you very much. It does help you learn some random words and gives you a feel for Russian, but that is about it.HOWEVER, the CD's format does allow you to learn numbers, time and dates fairly well and then tests you on them in an effective manor. If you feel you are weak in numbers, time and dates, then it is worth the cost to learn them. I found that I'm very fast at numbers as a result of this course. By itself, the course doesn't do much, but for the specific area of numbers and time, I can't think of a better way to learn.It is also a nice way to expose childern to a new language. It is fairly easy to pick up the words in the games and childern seem to enjoy these types of games."
2,Frustrating,"My biggest beef with this product is the speakers do not always enunciate, which made attempting to repeat what they said a struggle."
2,"Worth the price, but that's not saying much...","I bought this thinking hey, it's ten bucks, what have I got to lose? Well, the answer to that question is ten bucks. If you're broke and want to learn Russian, save your money for food and get a library card. Pass on this.I'd only give it one star, but I'll give it two because it's so cheap and you could learn something from this if you put forth serious effort. But you'd be better off buying the Penguin Russian course instead for almost the same price."
4,Good Starter for willing students.,"This is a very good program for people who are just starting to learn the Russian language. This program gives students a few basic words and phrases that will help a student get introduced to the language. It is worth the money in my opinion however the program is geared toward a younger age group and does not go very deep into the Russian language. Overall, this program would be a good way to start."
4,Pretty Good,"I thought that this software ASSISTED me in learning russian. It helped me learn basic words. For that price, it is very good!!!"
2,Difficulty with Immersion Russian CD,"I liked the combination of repetition of words and games to reinforce learning, although the male and female's pronunciations were difficult to hear at times. Also, the program stopped running in the middle of the lessons. I have Windows XP, and have not been able to figure out the problem, rendering the CD's useless to me. If anyone knows what the problem is and how to fix it, I would like to know."
3,This will not teach you Russian,"Although this is not a bad supplement to learning Russian it is just that, a supplement. Unlike a college textbook this will not teach the Cyrillic alphabet (even though it assumes the student knows it) nor will it teach verb conjugation and doesn't seem to have any kind of dictionary or grammar guide.However, it will help both begining and intermediate students improve their speaking ability and reinforce their vocabulary.If you're not taking a Russian class but learning from a book this will serve as a good language lab (it has the ability to record and play back your pronounciation).In conclusion, don't buy this title mistakenly believing that it alone can teach you to do anything but learn to speak the most basic vocabulary and phrases."
3,Not Bad for the Price,"This is a two cd rom set. The first one gently takes you through some beginning exercises that are fun and teach you some VERY VERY limited vocabulary that might be useful if, say, you're on a guided tour of Russia with some one else to handle the language for you, and you just want to be able to say a couple of very basic things. (Especially number practice is very well done)So far, so good. But then when you switch to the 2nd CDrom.. all of a sudden EVERYTHING is in Russian including the game instructions, verbal and written cues plus you're required to do some comparatively sophisticated manipulation of language in the games themselves--skills that the first CDrom did nothing to teach! It's sort of like being moved from first week, Level 1 Russian straight to a 2nd year college class. This produces a lot of frustration. To be effective there should be 4 more carefully stepped CDroms inserted between the 2."
5,fun CD!,"was not able to find ""aint gonna hurt nobody"" as a single anywhere to download so i had to give in & get the soundtrack, but i was glad i did!"
1,Where Does a Mother Go?,"Well, with the kind of judgmental attitude Barbara Johnson has toward others different from herself, she's going down to the fiery place. And fast. For the record, Christian = Acceptance, not Christian = Intolerance."
5,Can't wait to use it!,Since I graduated with an Associates in Deaf Studies I have utmost confidence in this next level which our degree didn't cover at the time. I can't wait to go over it and refine my signing skills.
4,The collector in our family loves this book!,"I bought this book as a gift for my father, who collects antique farm tools and tractors, has done his own restorations, and goes to antique shows all the time. I have no higher praise than this: when he settles in for the night, he gets in his favorite chair and opens that book. He may read it for hours, or browse a few pages, but it's his favorite reading material."
4,Fun reference,This is a great read for anyone interested in old farm equipment. The only problem was that I recognized too many of the pieces from my childhood and started realizing how old I am.
2,*~*A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS~*~*,My 4 year old daughter received this as a Christmas gift and she loves Doll houses. She has played with it for about 30 minutes and then put it away! She much rather play with her Sweet Streets Fisher-price doll house sets...she has the whole town and seems to love them...Maybe getting her more piece will make her want to play with this oversized dollhouse....We are going to keep it for a couple of years to see if it grows on her but I doubt that it will.
5,A must!,"We got this for our then 3 yr old daughter. I honestly think that it's most played with toy that we have. Whenever other kids are over, even older ones, the dollhouse is always played with. I do wish it came with more accessories but I've noticed that, for the past Octobers, Toys R Us has a buy one, get one free for the accessories. You can't beat that. One other thing that I wish they offered is selling the people separately instead of just one mom and baby or dad and baby, etc. My daughter wants another baby, but what are we going to do with another mother?The reason I gave 4 stars for durability is because the stable often separates from the house. I don't think they are being hard on it because it has come apart when I was closing it up. It's not always easy to get it back together.Overall, this is a wonderful pretend play toy. I'm just wondering if we need the Loving Family Townhouse this year for Christmas. Hmmmmm."
5,A GREAT GIFT,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it, we leave it out all the time. there hasn't been a day since Christmas that her or her 6 year old brother hasn't played with it. I bought a lot of accesories to go with it. They are very durable, my kids aren't the gentlest sometimes with their toys..This was a great gift, you can always buy more things to go with it.."
5,Daughter loves it,"My daughter is four years old and received the Dollhouse and Stable as a gift. She will spend long periods of time engaging in imaginary play with her family. It is very interesting to see what personalities she gives the family members, and the words she attributes to them. I would recommend this gift to friends and families with similar age children."
5,Fun for many Years!,"We bought this Dollhouse Last Christmas 2002 and also got several of the Room sets to go with it; Nursery, Childs room, Dining room, and the Bathroom.They Price is also very reasonable in my opinion. She is almost 4 years old now. She loves rearranging the Furniture and playing with the Dolls. She is very into horses right now too (My little pony's especially). Her grandparents also purchased the Grandparent Dolls to go with it. This Christmas ""Santa"" will probably add a few more rooms, The parents Bedroom and a Car.I guess my only complaint is that the Baby has a bottle attached to it. If they had a baby without a bottle I would be 100% pleased."
5,One of the best toys ever!,"We bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas almost two years ago and I forgot to write a review then. I can tell you that even after two years, it is still one of her favorite toys, she plays with it several times a week. It's also the toy her friends go to first when they visit. All the furniture and accessories still look like new, in spite of all this use. For quality, value and fun, you can't top Fisher Price!"
5,"A fun, educational toy","My mom bought this for my 3 year old this past christmas. She was so excited. She was just starting to get into horses also, and now that is all she wants to add is more horses. Suprisingly, she allows her 1 1/2 year old sister to play also. It is educational as far as them learning to play together, and all the ""household"" chores they make the dolls do. Very cute toy. Will be in our house for years."
4,My twins love it!,My 3 year old twins received this for Christmas. They think it is great. We have already purchased 2 rooms of furniture. They also got a couple more horses for Christmas that go with the house.I would highly recommend this toy. It is not as sturdy as most Fisher Price toys. But for ages 3 and up it is great!
4,overpriced,"This Barbie added to my collection, but I wish I had shopped around first, I could have saved appx. 25.00-35.00.I found out after I had already placed my order that I could have saved this money. The amount saved was enough to buy other Wizard of of Barbie's direct from toys-r-us.They did not have the wicked witch, but I did find it other places. This was my first purchase from internet use, I will know better next time. The Barbie is just what I ordered and I am very happy with my entire collection of Wizard of OZ Barbie's"
3,Mattel The Wizard of Oz Wicked Witch of the West Barbie Doll,"I realize this is a Barbie doll, but in order to truly pay tribute she should have looked like the Wicked Witch of the West in the movie. This Barbie, green faced or not is far to pretty to create any fear like we experience when we see Margaret Hamilton play the part to the hilt complete with green makeup and enhanced nose and facial features. All the rest of the Barbie collection is to be commended on how close they are to the original characters they immulate. At the very least they could have given you a fake nose with a wart that could be removed to show she was in a costume.CA Luster"
3,"charming, but really small","It's nice. It does what you'd hope - be a candle-flickering type thing, but be safe to use. Just be aware that it's really small, smaller than the packaging looks somehow."
2,LED candle,"The candles are very nice, once we got them to work. The two star rating is for the customer survice. I had ordered a pair of these and when they arrived only one worked. I called Phillips to see if they would replace the needed LCD. They did replace the defective part, but they wanted me to package and pay the postage to send back the nonworking part, which I suspect could only be valued in penneys. When I buy something new, I expect it to work right out of the box, or I expect the company that produced the product to make it right at thier expense."
2,The pictures were promising...,"Don't buy this product based on the pictures provided. You get the led candle thinking the light will be a soft white/candle like color (as expected from the pictures)--it's more of an orange halloween color. Not only that, but it's a Ni-MH battery--so there are only so many charging cycles before the battery will no longer hold a charge (approx. 300-400 depending on if you charge/discharge the battery each time). Save your money and buy some real candles. Just to reiterate--the pictures made the product look really cool, but the color of the light is completely different from what is seen in the pictures."
5,DOLL MAGIC!,"This book will not only make you want to buy it, but will also tease you to start collecting dolls! Dolls from plain to the unique are captured beautifully and held spellbound with prose and print that is purely captivating!Young and old alike will enjoy this book, which must be read aloud with attitude! A sure mother/daughter pleaser!"
2,"Too short, off count, ...","The only good thing I can say about this video is that I got it on sale. I consider myself to be on an intermediate/advanced work out level. This workout was just not enough, you warm up, do the cardio part of it (about ten minutes) and before you know it you're at the cool down portion. I read a few reviews about this DVD, and the one about the lump in his shorts is actually true... its so distracting, and the blond girl in the back doesn't have a clue what she's doing. The only person that seems motivated is Silk himself. I think i'll stick to my Tae Bo, even if its double the price. After i'm done, i don't feel worked out at all, this is not a good buy if you're a good athlete, nor if you are a beginner. The moves that are put together are too confusing. ..."
2,Commercial on Silk too long...can't forward on DVD,"The workout part is good when you FINALLY get to it. You have to sit through the posing of Silk Manning in what seems to be forever and the DVD isn't programmed to advance to the start of the workout. When you start a workout, it goes immediately to the ""how-to"" part and you can't do anything but watch it everytime. So, you have to fool with seeing unuseable stuff for 10-15 minutes before you can begin exercising....and this is on the DVD."
4,Great Beginner Video,"This is a great dvd for beginners. Silk takes the time to explain the moves and keeps you motivated. If you're deciding between this and Tae Bo and you are a beginner, get this one first.There are only 2 minor complaints.1. The introduction you have to sit through of Silk Manning showing off his kickboxing moves is a bit corny. He's a model so I guess he couldn't help the urge to grab the spotlight for a minute.2. Once you start getting comfortable with the intermediate level you begin to wish it was longer. Again, if you're a beginner the length of the workout is perfect, but once you move into intermediate you want more. Thats when I'd recommend you move to Tae Bo."
2,Cheesy,"Just by his name, Silk Manning, you can tell how cheesy the workout is. The music is so annoying and he is even more so. With a background in kickboxing, I found his movements incorrect and his instructions lacking. I can see how a newcomer could hurt themselves because he does not instruct properly how to follow through with the movements. It DOES get your heart rate up and you will sweat. However, it won't be the workout that you are dying to do."
3,"Good moves, good cuing, but...","There are no suggestions in this video to avoid injury (e.g. on deep bends, don't let your knees extend beyond your toes), and you can't just rewind the dvd by individual sections if you want to extend the warm-up or cardiovascular section. However, the beginner and intermediate workouts can be used one right after the other if you fast forward through the intro. I prefer Kick Butt Kombo, because you can just skip to each section you want to repeat to extend the cardio, warm-up or abs workouts."
4,Very Short Workout,I would recommend this tape to people who do NOT have time for the Rolls Royce of kickboxing workouts Tae-Bo...Each workout is only 15-20 minutes long but there are some good moves..I wouldnt buy this tape if I was looking for something hardcore but its not useless.. if you are pressed for time you can do this tape..
3,I know a secret,"Anyone who is interested in purchasing this DVD, I have to tell you, don't. (Not because it's a bad workout, it's a fantastic workout. It got my heart pumping and I felt completely energized when I finished.)The intermediate workout on this DVD is a bonus workout on the DVD ""8 minute arms and abs"". This is also a excellent workout, plus on the ""8 min.."" DVD you don't have to put up the Silk's endless posing in the intro."
4,"Nostalgic,Classic It's always nice to go back...","Pavlova, just the name rings feminine grace...Pavlova created and marketed in 1922 is the fragrance queen of all that was pretty,lush, and delightful during those roaring 20's.With flowery and sandal notes this is a fragrance made all your own once applied."
2,"60% useless, 40% acceptable","The contoured pads in this variety pack do a passable job, but the ultra thin pads are entirely useless. It's not so much that they don't absorb much liquid, it's that they absorb too slowly to catch the leaking milk before gravity pulls the drip down past the edge of the pad.All of the pads in this pack are also scratchier than other brands I've tried, including the generic ones that the nurses gave me at the hospital after I delivered.Out of all the brands I've used, the best so far have been the Phillips AVENT Disposable pads. If you're buying from Amazon, the price is comparable to the Gerber pads for a box of 100 and the quality is WAY better."
1,Use Johnson & Johnson or Lansinoh,"I have light flow and these breast pads don't work at all for me. The pads are very thin and scratchy, irritating the nipples. You can't wear a nursing top or bra without a lot of padding over them because they crease and crinkle inside clothing and the creases are very noticable. Basically, when I wear these, I look like I have a bunch of newspaper scrunched up inside my top or bra! Also, they don't have adhesive so they don't stay in place. They move around inside my nursing top at night so I end up with leaks and wet clothing. Inside my nursing bra after nursing they end up crunched up, folded in half or sometimes back to front! I have to take them out, look at them to figure out the right way to go back in and then put them back in. Definitely not for discreet nursing, so I can't wear them outside the house. I don't have any of these problems with the Johnson & Johnson nursing pads which stay put, don't crease and don't leak."
5,"ultra thin, ultra absorbant, and covers most the breast","I've tried four different kinds of pads and these have worked the best by far. They are ultra thin and very absorbant. I have a heavy flow and the Johnson & Johnson and Avent ones are too thick (which prevent them from absorbing as much) and are incredibly small. They also fill up really fast, causing them to overflow and milk to go EVERYWHERE. The Gerber ones cover the entire nipple area and most of the breast (other pads hardly cover just the nipple area). However, I'd recommend the heavy flow ones rather than the medium flow-- they just don't work as well. Also, I really don't see how they can slip out of place if you are using the right bra size. I'd recommend the Lansinoh brad as well for the same reasons I'm recommending the Gerber ones."
1,"Leaks, Leaks, Leaks","I've tried many different brands of breast pads and these are the worst. They leak if you don't change them after every feeding. I usually had to double or triple them up just in case they leaked when I went out.I have found that the best pads on the market are Curity. They are less expessive, but work very well."
1,Not worth it.. Go with Lansinoh pads!,"I tried these pads since they were cheaper and I liked other Gerber items, but I leaked twice (thank god it was at home). After that, I decided to switch to Lansinoh pads and I am so glad I did. They are worth the extra money! They're individually wrapped and I never leaked with them. They are so thin and discreet."
2,didn't like these one bit!,"I haven't tried the heavy flow yet because the medium works for me, however, I don't enjoy everyone being able to tell I am wearing them. The ultra thin and lights are completely useless and I am not even a heavy leaker most of the time! They also seem to bunch up in my bra and I end up with little fuzz balls sometimes unlike other kinds I have tried. Overall all, I wouldn't recommend these and I won't buy them again either."
2,This is good if you don't leak much,"I bought these because my sister who had a baby a couple of months before me recommended them, but I was very dissapointed; my clothes would always get soaked if I left them on for more than 3 hours. I'm giving it 2 stars just because they worked well for my sister who does not leak as much as I do."
1,horrible,This is the worst pad I have tried. They don't even have adhesive strips so are constantly slipping. Go with Lansiloh or better yet Johnson and Johnson if you can find them. I ended up throwing away the rest of the box!!!
2,Nice & Thin But Leaked Too Much,"I tried these and they are nice and thin but everytime I would nurse on one side, the other side would have a let down and I would leak through or soak the pad everytime. This means that in the beginning I would go through a box every 5-7 days because I can't stand that wet feeling. That can get really expensive!I didn't want to use the cloth pads much because they get soaked just as easily and here in Hawaii that means you can get thrush or infections due to the humidity.I switched to using Lilypadz. They actually stop the leaking by applying slight pressure. IT IS SO NICE TO BE DRY!!! They are $20 a pair but they are not disposable so you just rinse and reuse. They really helped me to stop night leaking. Also, you can wear swimsuits, and lingerie without having to wear a nursing bra. They work really well as long as they are applied properly."
2,doesn't work,"I bought these pads when my daughter was just born, thinking that they were a great deal. I haven't tried the heavy flow pads, but the light and med flow didn't hardly hold anything. I had to change them every couple of hours. And you would think that because they are so thin they would be more discreet, well that isn't true either. They wrinkled and bunched up and my nursing bras, and could be seen not only under t-shirts, but under thicker shirts as well. I would suggest going with one of the brands that that are formed to your body. The Medela ones look good, but I haven't tried them. I like the Lansinoh pads. They are more expensive than the gerber, but sooooo worth it. They are formed to your body and are filled with something that turns into a kind of gel. One set will last the whole night, so they are much more absorbant. And they are pink, which for some reason is not as noticable under white T's."
2,"Okay, but better products out there","I received a box as a shower gift, and they worked okay, unless I changed them a lot though, they ended up leaking. I was resigned to just living with wet spots, until someone gave me some of the Lansinoh pads to try. I have no idea why Babies R Us doesn't arry them, but they really need to. These things absolutely do not leak, they hold tons of liquid."
4,Good product,The heavy flow pads are so absorbent. I didn't have much use for the ultra thin ones by themselves. So I started using them with the heavy flow (at the same time). The heavy flow pads would last that much longer.
5,great kids gloves,"At our elementary school, the third grade students get hands-on with gardening in their Science classes. These gloves are great for gardening & just the right size for smaller hands."
5,"G & F 1823-3 ""Just for Kids"" Soft Jersey Kids Gloves",The gloves were great. They made an excellent compliment to the House Of Marbles Children's Garden Tool SetHouse of Marbles. Thank you.
4,Too big for 5yr old,I bought these for my 5yr old. Some reviews said their 4yr olds could fit in these BUT those kids must be huge. These gloves practically fit my own hands. I'm saving these for when my kid is about 10years old!
2,wrong size,Nice gloves for the price but they are not kid's size. They fit me and are way too big for my 5 year old.
4,Very nice,I am a big fan of Tiesto. But the one thing I dont understand is why release this album after the release of his excellent Revolution mix? Almost _every_ song here is an exact copy of songs from that album. I would suggest getting the Revolution mix and getting two excellently mixed cds instead of this.
5,AMAZING,"I have never taken the time to review anything, this is how strongly I feel about this cd. Some of the rawest sounds in trance I have ever heard. Bottom line if you like trance you will fall in love with Tiesto's style."
3,Good but not great....I expected more !!,"Tiesto Live in LA....the words conjured up visions of greatness, and while its an ok blend of old tunes, that are admittedly well mixed it just doesn't really make a big impact. There are no must have tunes selected here, nor any rare finds that you would have to share with your friends. Its a descent mix that is good but not great to drive home with. I wouldn't classify it as a ""must have"" or the ""goto"" cd to get you in the party mood. My recommendation is ""pass"" unless you are just collecting all things Tiesto !!!"
2,First time fans passover this cd.,"I'm a huge Tiesto fan. This would not be the case had this CD been my introduction to him. The Jan Jackson vocals are downright annoying. The tone is depressive and even the beats felt like they were aiming to make me suicidal. I don't know how this mix, being live, could have kept the ravers dancin."
3,has a special cut on it,"""sunrise at palamos"" is one of the most beautiful trance instrumental ""anthems"" i've ever heard"
3,"For Tiesto fan's only, not his best, but decent","This album is a nice mellow listen and is not really typical of a Tiesto live set. Most of his sets are very different, however, this mix seems a little planned. The reason why is it is almost identical to the Virgin label release of Revloution: The Brightside disc. It is nice to hear the crowd as it is not overbearing on this cd. The tracklisting is not anything spectacular, but the mixing for the most part is decent. I wouldn't recommend it as a first time Tiesto purchase. For that, I would purchase any of the first three In Search of Sunrise cd's or Majik 6, Live From Amsterdam. It is a nice cd to listen to as backfround music, but not a classic like the aforementioned mixes."
4,Tiesto's Rockin L.A. Performance Brings Down The House,I heard this set that night at the legendary Mayan theatre in Los Angeles. It was great. If you like Tiesto you should check this out. Four stars for a top notch performance by Tiesto.
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"Cheap. When I tried to return them they were going to charge me for the ""free shipping"", the return shipping and a 15% restocking fee. You do the math. I donated it to charity."
1,rip off,"there is absolutely nothing ""magnetic"" about these. they are plain plastic rollers with small plain metal clips. conair has something similar and there is a reason that ""con"" is in the name."
4,Here you will find all their greatest hits,"This is the CD that really contains all the biggest hits from Gibson Brothers. But sadly not all the songs are in their 12"" versions, which should be included whenever possible."
5,I love this book!,This is a great book that is fun to read. I bought it to enjoy with my own children and with my students.
3,Adhesive wasn't that Great On These!,"I have long been a fan of Band-Aid Bandages since I was a kid, but these particular ones surprised me when it only barely stuck overnight on a scratch that I acquired from my one of my Poms. I'm now a little skeptical of these ones. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCPW8C/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3 and I bought quite a few, I'm hoping that this box is the only one that is like this!"
2,Looks and Brand can be deceiving,It just does not cut as well as most other brand over $5. I should have returned it but the hassle wasn't worth it.
2,Consider using a blade.,"I've owned a 8140Xl for a little over a year. I've just ordered new blades from Amazon. I'm not happy about a shaver that requires replacement parts that soon. From the beginning the quality/closeness of the shave was inadequate. I'm considering going back to a blade.On the plus side, the unit holds a charge well. I'd estimate a clean shaven man could go, at least, a week between charges. The unit charges fully in just a few hours, too.I don't like the shape, either. I've never dropped it but it feels awkward."
3,"Line art is nice, but wouldn't recommend this for coloring","Length:: 0:34 MinsThis one is firmly in the ""decorative reference"" category and lends itself best to xeroxing or possibly scanning for craft use. The designs are several to a page, and fairly large. A warning to coloring enthusiasts: it's printed on glossy paper. I think most mediums (pencils, crayons, markers, et al) would react poorly with it. For the price - this series has a 20% higher price-point than their competitor, Dover - I'm not so impressed. ""Flip through"" and see what you think..."
1,"Heard of ""B"" movies...This is a ""O"" movie","Absolutely terrible! The story was weak, the acting weak and I've seen better camera work in wedding videos. Don't waste your money or worse, your time."
2,Time to fall asleep!,"With this CD the only thing that you will learn is basic vocabulary. The games that it has are so boring that you feel like going to sleep right away...They are slow, repetitive and show a total lack of creativity. The voices are also pretty monotone.By the way, the accent is from Portugal, so if you need to learn Brazilian Portuguese, this is not the right tool.Don't say I didn't warn you!!!"
2,poor,"For a few days after I bought this CD, I could have fun because I had no knowledge on Portuguese. You can memorize little amount of basic words for sure. But as I progress, I realized that This 2 CD-ROM set lacked the most significant thing in learning a new language. It does not provide any grammar nor greeting frase such as ""How are you?"" and ""I'm fine""Compared to the 1st CD, the 2nd CD was way too hard. There are so many words that had not been mentioned in the 1st CD. You'll never understand the 2nd CD even when you perfectly mastered the 1st CD. I'm studying Portuguese using other software and books. It has been a month, but I still can't understand the 2nd CD."
2,Can someone learn Portuguese with these programs?,"My answer is NO. I bought this 2 CD Set several weeks ago and each CD lasted me about 2 days. The first CD teaches you basic vocabulary. It has some games, but they are pretty lame and I got tired of it after a few games.Second one is a lot more advanced and focused on listening. If you know Spanish, or other romance language, the games will be too easy. In my case, I got most of questions right at first try, learning some new expressions and words. If you don't know romance languages...it will be too hard, since there is no explanation of grammar, what so ever."
2,"No, No, No, and No","I thought at first the first CD was good for beginners, It tought you basic words and they are easy to remeber. If you understand little of portuguese this would be good to refresh on but if you know portuguese I would say go with something else. It doesnt even teach you how to put sentences together like ""And, But, The,"" or any other words."
3,BRIO Smart engine,"We bought the BRIO smart engine for our 5 year old grandson, along with the reversing and speed-changing track sections. Our grandson has an extensive set of Thomas the Tank Engine pieces, along with track from BRIO and ""Thomas"". The track sections are compatible with the old track, but the engine will not negotiate the sharp turns on some track sections.The 3 ""driver"" wheels on each side of the engine are too close together, and force the lead wheels off the track. This is disappointing, since the toy is well-made, and could be very exciting."
5,"Finally, a gate we are happy with!","After trying out several gates at the top of our stairs, I am happy to say we can finally stop looking! We have wooden balusters on both sides and it was difficult to find hardware to install properly. This gate seems very sturdy and looks nice. Installation is a little bit tricky, because you have to adjust all 4 pieces of hardware to get the gate to fit and lock just right. However this was not a big deal, took about 30 minutes start to finish. We are very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend!"
1,Eyeball Rupture,"This indeed is a solid gate. And when locked proves a sturdy barrier.But there is a top locking ""T"" piece which sticks out horizontally by a few inches. When your toddlers eye height reaches approx. 30"" this ""T"" piece has the real potential to either injure the eye straight on or pluck it out during swinging.. . . . . .. See customer image #3; Ignoring that latch which they rigged up. See the threaded screw protruding from the top bar? It has a ""T"" end ( literally a scoop).This dangerous flaw is also found on some other metal gates. Be aware. Recall!"
3,sat in our attic,"We had better luck with pressure mounted (or partial pressure mounted gates.) This one seemed very solid, but the installation was a little complex and we never installed it."
1,Piece of junk....in a bulky expensive return box. I will check all the fine print first next time...ugh!,"I got my baby gate today...what a monstrous mistake! It is a piece of junk, and I am just sick about ordering it. I'm going to Baby's R Us now...which I wanted to avoid. My gate is a few pieces of metal with some bolts thrown into a box...what a joke. I tried to save time and money...lesson learned. This piece of junk was sent by Baby Earth...avoid like the plague."
4,Perfect for keeping toddlers off the stairs!,"I ordered this gate a few months ago and it has been a life saver! My one year old is so curious about the stairs that she always wants to be on them but the gate keeps her from them. She pulls on it and pushes it and it will not budge, it feels strong and secure. On the otherhand, my three year old is confident on the stairs and the latch is easy enough for him to open and close if he needs to. We love it and would use it over a tension gate any day, especially at the stairs. It give me piece of mind when I have to take my eyes off the kids for a sec."
5,Great gate,"We purchased this gate about a year ago to put at the top of the stairs in the open concept house we were building. Our child was not quite 2 when we moved in and we were planning more children, so we knew a gate would be a permanent fixture for probably at least five years. So far so good. Have not had any problems with it. We installed it directly into the wall and top beam of the stair railing, did not bother with the extra installation kit as filling in four screw holes in a few years seems better than having an ugly extra piece of wood strapped to the railing for years. Baby #2 coming soon and I am glad we have this gate!!!"
5,Baby gate,"We installed this at the top of our stairs. First off, very attractive gate. Secondly, sturdy and safe. Thirdly, easy to operate. Husband had no problem installing."
2,broke,"The gate was pretty good,until my 14 month old broke one of the spindles. I guess he shook it too much. It did seem like he did, but it broke. Lasted 7 months."
5,Kid Gate,Put this gate at the top of our stairs. It works great as my 1 year old truly has no fear. She can lean on this thing and it will not move. But the latch is not so complicated or difficult to open that my 3 year old is able to do it herself. Great gate.
4,A good gate,"I bought this gate for the top of our staircase. We have an old black metal railing and it blends in perfectly. I had my husband install it by drilling right into the metal rail. It is sturdy. Easy, one handed operation. Keeps the baby off the stairs. Only con is it makes a loud clanking sound when locked in to place (but that might be from our particular installation situation.) Overall I would reccommend without reservations."
2,Another disappointing Adams novel..,"""Rich Rewards"" is anything but rich or a reward. Alice Adams's fourth novel starts strong, but ends as a dud. It follows Daphne, an interior designer, with a past of bad(and I mean BAD) love affairs. Her only good relationship was with a mysterious French socialist named Jean-Paul. Naturally, they cross paths, but by this time, we're bored to death. The ending is a rip-off, and destroys the whole novel."
4,Aussie pop music for the world.,"Featuring 2 members of former Aussie chart act Pseudo Echo (""Funky Town""), this is a great slice of guitar pop. Extremely radio friendly with a catchy chorus, It deserves success in the US. Think Matchbox 20 meet Savage Garden, and you've got the makings of a big hit. Radio music programmers, the challenge is yours."
4,Great but...,"This is a nice collection, but why not wait until Wall-E comes out on DVD in November? Either way, this is a great collection but the only downside is that the movies only come in 1-Disc format. Every Pixar movie except for Cars and Ratatouille had a 2-Disc release. So you're better off buying the individual movies if you want the special features. If you really want a Disney/Pixar collection, wait for another collection to come out that includes Wall-E. I already have these movies so I'm set. But all in all it is a great collection for those who don't have the movies."
2,full screen?,"did anyone notice in the specs that this set is listed as being 1.33:1? yup, these are the full-screen versions. i wouldn't have bought this anyways because i already own most of them, but if i were looking for a boxed set, it would certainly be the wide-screen version.of course, that could be a typo."
2,Disc doesn't work,"We bought this for Christmas and are slowly making our way through the movies. We found out last night that the Toy Story 2 disc doesn't play properly, it started freezing during the first scene. I took it out and looked at the disc (first time ever played) and it looked smudged but it wasn't dirty, it was actually ingrained into the disc in a spot. We had to skip through a few scenes to watch the movie, very disappointing.If it wasn't for that, the set has been great so far (we're about 3/4 through the movies, haven't touched any of the numerous bonus disc). Nice collection of movies, lots of bonus discs. However having a movie that doesn't play from the start was a HUGE let down. :("
4,Great selection,"We got this for my 2.5 year old son. He hasn't watched everything yet, but this is just a great selection of movies for kids. And even adults can enjoy too. We like to take it for trips and the case does not sepalate to individual DVD, so that is only the Con. Either take the entire case or put it in a separate jewery box."
4,Needs a bit more documentation.,"Purchased for the installation of Blum hinges, this was definitely more accurate than the plastic ""universal"" drilling guides available in the big-box hardware stores. However, the directions were minimalist and image-based; it would have benefitted from a more complete, multi-language instruction sheet.For example, see those little orange-red knob-like things at the top of the photo? They control the depth from the edge of the door. When rotated, they will give you depths from 2mm to 7mm, and this will vary by the model of hinge and application. The chart on the instruction sheet is helpful, but I had to play with the device for a bit to understand that the orange knobs were the means of setting that depth."
5,engine light gone,"After installing this, did a reset and engine light gone. I Have a Honda Accord 2001 EX with engine codes 1166 & 1167"
4,"512 megs, at a premium.","For a long time, MultiMediaCards (MMCs) were a tough sell against other formats such as CompactFlash & SmartMedia (and lately vs Sony Memory Sticks too), largely because they were offered in smaller memory capacities and always had a higher cost-per-meg than those formats. The SD card (interchangeable with MMC cards) is a format which has some distinct advantages over the other formats in terms of physical size and memory protection. However, when compared to other SD cards of smaller sizes (eg. the several 256MBs available), there is a considerable premium here on a dollar-per-meg basis (all of those are well under 50 cents per meg). I think for most folks it makes more sense to buy two 256 MBs than to put all one's eggs (and files) in one costlier basket. When the new 1 Gig cards come out, the price on the 512s will drop."
5,Memory Card for a college student,"I am a typical college student, I am not a photgrapher to be or anything, so this digital card was perfect for me. I get about 330 pictures on my second best setting and have never come close to taking that many pictures. I believe this card is great for anyone who is not obessed with taking pictures, or to someone who loads them on quickly. :)"
1,Problems at radom,This LEXAR brand has had issues with it's Memory Cards. I lost lots of pictures from a vacation to Disney World and a Convention. Their site had SOFTWARE that was to help recover some of those lost images!! I have never had Flash memory trouble until LEXAR! I now only buy SCANDISK items. Samsung invented this tecnology and SD is their product. The Store I bought the LEXAR chip was in a hurry to give me another chip I could trust. He gave me the higher costing SD chip. I wasn't the first to have issues from buying it in his store. He took a $50.00 loss to make me happy. People take lots of photos now that we went Digital. Imagine looking for some pictures you know you took and they are not there! Most think they messed up. WIth this chip you will have that happen so pay very close attention. Most of what is lost can not be recovered. Pay the extra money for SCANDISK.
2,Main tube melts in heat,"I bought the T-Minus last year (2007) and it's a great trainer except for one thing: the main vertical tube melted in the heat. I contacted the company and asked if I could buy a replacement but they never responded to me. So for that reason, I'm giving them a 2 star review."
1,Burberry Brit Eau de Toilette for women,Not sure I like this scent. Smells more like men's cologne. Trying to use it up to get rid of it. Won't buy it again.
1,Not sure,"I am not sure how to rate these things... Got them via ups yesterday, and OMGosh! They are thinner the the pants I wear. I will give them a shot when the weather gets cold and may have to revise this, but as it stands I am skeptical."
5,Awesome to use in horrible weather,I got these to wear in the winter. So far they are the best thing I have purchased for riding and are a fabulous price.
5,Unbelievable!,Enthusiastically recommended! If you like tangos of 1930's or 1940's you must hear this. Most of the pieces are tangos. Classically trained Robert Gaden gets tremendous intensity to the playing. Some could say this orchestra sounds like an argentine tango orchestra but it's better.
5,The Best Work He Has Ever Done.,"Warning. This CD Contains Great Songs Of Mine Such As Baby Blue, Baby's Gotten Good At Goodbye, Ace In The Hole Which He Named His Band, And Love Without Men, Amen."
3,bad quality,These boots don't last too long before they lose shape and your feet are swimming in them giving you blisters. The quality of the design is horrible but they are really cute.
3,Professional if soft centred Western,"There are not that many Westerns that revolve around child custody and this alone helps set Paine's feel good Western slightly apart from the pack.The Spirit Meadow of the title marks the site of a massacre of Ute Indians in New Mezico and then hero of the tale ,Joe Bryan ,is camping in this reputedly haunted spot when he meets Hawk who disappears in the morning leaving the kind hearted Joe with a young Native American boy ,the son of Hawks dead daughter.He takes the boy to his sister Mary Jane -recently widowed-who takes the boy in and resolves to raise him as her own.This incurs the wrath of the local Indian agent ,Frank Beale who has designs on Mary Jane who decidedly rejects his advances.The sub plot revolves around rustling at the Campbell ranch with whom Joe briefly finds work.The two plots come together at the climax of the book .Its a feel good Western ,rather soft centred and lacking bite but genre devotees will enjoy it ."
3,Definitely the right tool but...,"This kit includes two tools. It is possible to properly compress the spring with two tools but it is much easier with THREE tools (1.5 kits). With two, at for example the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions, one of the tools will always try to slip off to the 4 or 8 o'clock position. With three tools, it is very easily to compress the spring without the tool slipping."
5,Spring compressor,The spring compressor was just what I needed to change the struts on my wife's Aztek. It made the job very easy.
2,Very poor quality,"Well, the reason I'm complaining about this DVD is because many people are going to be misled by it's name. It's NOT a DVD with songs from the Americana album. The video quality is very poor (they say it's on purpose when the video starts, but there's no mention to it on the outside of the box)and the songs are from the older albums. It would have been nice if they had included the music videos from the Americana album. Only for the biggest fans..."
5,bought it for my husband,bought it for him for christmas and he loved it. package arrive on time and cover was un-flawed. . /
4,She always knows just how I'm feeling!,"Reba has always been able to hit home with every one of her songs. Reba is an exeptional songstressand I wll never stop listening to her music. The first time I ever heard her song ""If I Had Only Known, I was in jail and one of the other girls sang it every night and that's when I found out ""she had done it again because I was notified that my x-fiance had up and disappeared and I would never see him again."
3,Nice Country Sound from Reba,"I am not a Reba McEntire fan. Someone gave me this album. She is a pleasant enough singer, but has a bit too much country twang that I don't like very well, such as you hear with Loretta Lynn, who I can't stand. But it is tolerable and the album will probably delight Reba's fans. I can take it or leave it. One bright spot for me was the song ""The Night That The Lights Went Out in Georgia"". It is just as good as the original by Vicki Lawrence; perhaps even better. Not an album I would buy myself, but not sorry to have it in my collection and will probably give it a listen a few times a year."
1,Will never order another CD,I buy CD's for making video albums of family and friends. Makes it more interesting. I add music to the pictures. But every CD I ordered has copyrights on them. They will let you rip and burn another cd buy not put it on pictures. Total waste of money. Will go back to the old way and use a Microphone to add to pictures. More work but less money....
5,Marvelous Tear-Jerkers,"If you like tear-jerkers, this is the album for you! Reba recorded this just after the death of her band in a plane crash, and you can tell. This album contains one devastatingly sad song after another. All are beautiful, with powerful feelings of love, loss and regret. Country music at its best!"
5,Funeral song,"Heard ""If I hd only known"" at a funeral and had to have it. Found it and have enjoyed it. Good price great delivery."
1,"No Legacy Port Setting, But Advertized As Such","Card installs under Windows XP but won't allow ports to be changed to x278 or x378 as advertized. Consequently, won't work with ANY of my security dongles (Sentinel, GlobeTrotter, FlexID, SafeNet). Kinda of a rip-off, in that this card is MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE than other cards of this type and won't perform in legacy mode as stated. If you just need an LPT3 port at a PCI address, like xE800, then buy a cheaper card, there are many for under $10 that work as good as this one."
2,Wish I could have gotten past the first few chapters...,"I could not finish this book. I bought it based on its positive reviews, but I took it on vacation, and could not make it past the first few chapters.Maybe it gets better, but the writing seemed meladramatic and it DID, as another reviewer commented, seem like just another family drama. One that did not interest me."
5,"A terrific, real-world novel about one family","This is one of those terrific novels that show how real people -- people we all can relate to -- deal with life's ups and downs. Lana loves her family -- husband and two teenage daughters -- but questions her parenting abilities and interest. When tragedy strikes, she faces challenges as simple as getting out of bed in the morning and as complex as dealing with one daughter's psychological problems. Oh, yes, and there's her own narcissitic mother, her seemingly helpless younger sister and a somewhat overbearing older sister. The psychology in this book rings true, from Lana's insecurities as an adoptive mother to the teenagers' often irrational thought patterns. The payoff, in the end, is what every truly satisfying novel has: characters who have grown and changed, right before your eyes. I couldn't put this one down."
2,Unrealistic yet somehow heartwarming,"Meg and Jared enter a marriage of convenience ""for the twins' sake"" meaning the boys they've each adopted separately. Meg is a divorced single mom busy with her job and her son, Luke; Jared is grieving the loss of his wife and trying to raise their adopted son Chance. At the anniversary party of the adoption agency, the two discover that their sons are identical twins who've somehow been separated. Deciding to raise them together, Meg and Jared marry despite Meg's reluctance to deal with her distrust of men and Jared's guilt over his wife's sudden death. There's a subplot of sorts that's not resolved (which it probably will be in a sequel or two) about the agency's past dealings and the parentage of Kelly, one of the agency's workers. While the situation is unrealistic, Meg's brokenheartedness is all too real."
2,Fun idea...but not practical,"The keychain basically has a small drawer in it, which holds the dots. You slide it out to open it. It's not very tight, so the dots slip out of the drawer into your purse, even when it's closed. Using the game is a fun idea, but the dots don't have any adhesive material, so they'll slide all over the floor- not sure how you'd really use it. It was a cute idea, though."
4,Too small print!,"This is a wonderful book but even with my glasses on, it stressed my eyes to read as the type is very small. I bought the hardcover edition as it is in bigger print. I could only find it, very reasonably-priced, on the Renovare website, Amazon currently is only offering the leather-like and paperback editions."
4,With or Without the Deuterocanonical Books / Apocrypha,"There are plenty of helpful reviews regarding the content, I just wanted to comment on the inclusion or exclusion of the Apocrypha. There is a version of The Life With God Bible that includes it and one that does not. I accidentally purchased the one without because it it wasn't made clear one way or the other (and I didn't check the table of contents).So just to clarify:WITH the Apocrypha: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006162702X/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_35WITHOUT the Apocrypha: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061834963/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_34"
5,Such an amazing resource for deepening your walk with God,"I absolutely treasure this bible. The depth and soulfulness of the commentary is really extraordinary. If you are on a path of personal growth & you want support in the process of true spiritual formation, this is the bible for you."
5,Excellent source for all Christians,"This is now my primary Bible and reference for use in Sunday school studies, church service readings, and home study."
3,About the binding,"I won't speak to the content, but was the quality of the binding, print and pages ever cheap and poorly done. I appreciate this bible was inexpensive but it does not excuse the shoddy workmanship. For example, pages folded over and inproperly cut, a page from Jeremiah tucked into the blank pages at the end, and type print that appears to (my eyes at least) vary in thickness from page to page."
3,It's ok..but,"The notes are good, the material is good, but I don't know, I felt like I was still lacking something.If I were you, I'd just invest in some Renovare books on spiritual development instead. Sure it's more expensive, but it's worth it.Start with devotional or spiritual classics. You get alot of content for a low price.Then get spirit of the disciplines.For more indepth stuff get renovation of the heart, or the divine conspiracy.Read those books along with your regular bible. You'll get more depth than what's in here."
5,What a pleaure,"Having this provides one with a fine translation and solid opportunity for interpretation and application.I was leary about the last part, since often that can be sappy. Not so here.Selecting a Bible is hard. I have decided that for me, a hard bound book is best and worth any extra cost. Get one like this and add tabs. It is one big book.Shortcoming: No index. But with so much else, an index may have been hard to add.A great find after much looking."
4,Inspirational and Informational Approach,"If you're looking for a Bible that offers both devotional and study tools, you'll find the Renovare' approach helpful. I've long appreciated Richard Fosters'""disciplines"" and Eugene Peterson's ""message"", and they are only 2 of many scholars who worked on this project.The cost is reasonable for the amount of helps, interlinear notes and background info provided. It would be helpful in the next editions to provide a brief conconcordance, but overall, though the Book is large, I've encouraged several people to get their own copies."
3,NRSV RENOVAR SPIRITUAL FORMATION BIBLE,"Mine arrived today, and I'm sending it back tomorrow. Why? The print is too close to the binding, making it too hard to read the entire sentence. I've seen this in other Bibles, and frankly, it's irritating."
5,Funny and Raunchy,"This record brings back so many memories! My friend (a Canadian) had this and we would sit around for hours listening, laughing and of course blushing! Not for the sensitive listener! I still remember most of the pubic hair song and have been known to sing it in moments of little inhibition to selected audiences! No one has ever heard it and they think Im making this one up! Too funny! :)"
4,nice,Costume was as described and for the price can't complain. Mask was hard to lay back out but the costume itself was great!
3,"Not a ""Universal"" fit",Does not fit some wine bottles--too big for rubber gasket to enter and seal neck of bottle about half the time.
5,Good stuff,"I have been using this herb for over two years as a substitute for antihistamines and it is wonderful. As an herb, you have to allow it to get into your system. That takes three weeks to a month. Then, it works much better than any drug out there. Until it gets into your system, you can continue to take your regular antihistamine for the first week or two. After the first three months on butterbur, you might be able to take it every other day like I do."
3,Anectdotally interesting but technically suspect,"The author has a few very good recipes and a good knowledge of various cheeses, but cast doubt on his technical expertise through the following statement on Page 15,""Cream is composed of milk's larger fat globules, which float because they are heavier than water."" Any high-school chemistry student should know that cream floats because it is less dense than water -- just like oil. Maybe this was just a gross editing error, but you wonder why a cheese expert would even write this kind of error in a draft. The book does have good descriptions of various cheeses, serving suggestions, etc. However, as a Texas, I was disappointed with the brief section on Mexican cheeses which are delicious and becoming widely available in my region."
3,Cheese Primer,Pity this book doesn't have clear colour photographs. The content is excellent but the edition I have looks rather badly reproduced.
4,a good guide to find and try different cheeses (be your own critic after you read though),"Honestly . . . I'm not a big fan of the taleggio. And I know that's Mr. Jenkins' favorite and all . . . but I tasted nothing special and it didn't really stand out as cheeses I loved. And he's REALLY snobby - don't get me wrong - he has credential but some people just have personal preferences and different levels of acceptance. I love a fine Idiazabal or Pecorino Toscano, but I'll never turn down blue box Kraft Mac N' Cheese. period."
3,"Good, but getting out of date","A good introduction to cheese, with details about specific European cheeses (especially French) for the more advanced cheesehead. Good general overviews of the countries, and comments about some of the strengths and short-comings of each. Unfortunately, this book is going on 12 years old so it's almost irrelevant for locating specific cheeses.The section on the U.S. is especially out-of-date as the artisinal industry has continued to explode since publishing. Worth a buy and a browse for $10, but there must be something better out there."
4,Comprehensive enough for any cheese lover!,"Okay, I am a confirmed turophile; I love cheese. This book is more than comprehensive. The Primer lacked good colorful pictures to show off the various popular cheeses. I ended up buying another book just so I could see what the cheeses should actually look like. I need to see visuals!! I did not care for the crowded copy either. It was also a little too textbookish for me. Definitely not for the coffee table, but a good resource guide."
3,"Cheap printing, newsprint paper","The content is wonderful. Jenkins knows cheeses and presents the information in a clear and readable style. However the overall form of the book is problematic. I was hoping to keep this book as a reference, but it is printed on a cheap newsprint-type paper, and I expect it will soon be yellow and brittle. The photographs are poorly printed (then again photos do not show up well on such grainy paper). I have several other cooking books from Workman Publishing, and they were all well printed and bound, on clean bright paper. I wonder why Workman Pub. suddenly got so cheap?"
5,A worldly whirl,"Jenkins' comprehensive ""Primer"" offers cheese lovers a wonderfully opinionated global guide to everything, beginning with how cheeses are made, how to buy, store, eat and cook, and what wines and accompaniments to choose with each. This includes a list of his favorites and suggestions for cheese boards.Then comes the world tour - more than 150 pages for France, about 75 for Italy, 25 for Switzerland, 35 for Britain, 25 for Spain, 70 for the U.S., including a tour of regional cheese makers, and somewhat shorter looks at Scandinavia, Germany, the Balkans and Canada. The book concludes with a reference guide to the world's greatest cheeses.Interspersed are anecdotes, local cheeses to try when visiting and the occasional recipe. A must for cheese lovers."
5,Cheese Primer,Great - easy to use. Can be used as a resource guide to look up cheeses but also fun to read like a novel/travelogue. My daughter originally bought it as a resource for a school project and we have all enjoyed it. I also gave a copy as a gift with some fun and different cheeses. Great to take to your local cheese shop and spend the morning hunting around.
2,juliet Rising,"The first time I ordered this book it was ok, although it was not an easy to read book, partially with modern thoughts and words and partialy with old english type story line. I didn't think it was great the first time I read it and changing the cover to its current corset art didn't change my opinion and I AM DISAPPOINTED I GOT IT AGAIN."
3,I like Rachel,She doesn't have as much emotional baggage to carry around as Anna Pigeon or now Kate Shugak.
1,Speart is no Nevada Barr,"I was excited to find an author who had a series similar to one of my favorite mystery series author - Nevada Barr. Replacing Barr's Park Ranger Anna Pigeon with Speart's Fish & Wildlife Agent Rachel Porter seemed like my idea of a dream come true!But while the premise for both writers is the same, the outcome from this reader was far different!Simply put, Speart is no Barr. Her writing style is less polished, her plot's are transparent to the point of being ridiculous (I had the ""bad guys"" pegged mid-way through). In terms of character development, this is where Speart really hit rock bottom. Her main protaganist - Rachel Porter - was shallow and irritating. I didn't care for her as a reader should care. I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone who likes Nevada Barr or Dana Stebenow - you'll be disappointed!"
1,Clarification of previous review,"Note that in my previous review, in which I commented on the dreadful DVD transfer, I was only referring to the ""That Touch of Mink"" DVD. The Father Goose DVD is not that bad."
3,"Good, for what they are.","You gotta be a fan of Cary Grant to like these. They are fairly typical of the romantic comedies of the time. These movies are kind of like cotton candy -- sweet and enjoyable, but not much substance.Father Goose is, in my opinion, the better of the two, because is allows Cary Grant to stretch a bit, while still remaining true to the genre. His gruff, unshaven character is a departure from the suave, sophisticated of That Touch of Mink.If you're a fan of these type of movies, it's a worthy addition."
