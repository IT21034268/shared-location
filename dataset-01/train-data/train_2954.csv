5,Empowering and informative,"This book goes a long way towards encouraging girls (and women!) to put their creative powers to practical use. It is so gratifying to learn that many everyday items (ice cream cones; Toll House cookies) were invented by women. And the items that are not so 'everyday' (Kevlar; space shields) have such a positive impact on the world around us. The illustrations are wonderfully creative, blending the fascinating details of the text into whimsical collages. Don't forget the sidebars - lots of fun facts there as well."
4,good product for the price,Good product which improved the sound of my current system. I used a pair of these; discarding the video cablesto wire up my 2/1 channel rockford fosgate/ blaupunkt car audio system. The cables could be more flexible. Thewires improved ground performance ( noise rejection) and bass resolution.
5,"Great Singer, Great Album","LLLLOVE this album! E.G. has been one of my favorites since the mid-80's and this album only enhances her reputation as one of the best singer/songwriters out there. My absolute favorite cut is ""Don't Even Care"", although the entire album is thoroughly listenable. I would recommend it to anyone who likes good pop music. I wish E.G. the best and hope this album eventually finds the huge audience it deserves."
1,I love her but it's BORING!,"I was so disappointed when I got this CD home after wanting it for so long. From the cover art, it looks like she's doing techno, but noooooo, it's these bland ballads. She really rocked out on her first 2 albums, what happened? None of the songs are distinctive or memorable. No wonder it got no airplay and wasn't a hit. Even the bland Natalie Imbruglia at least had one good song. Can't even find one in this set to recommend. I'm surprised your other writers here liked it! Maybe I'm just too picky. I love her voice, but clearly this proves she needs commercial hitmaker songwriters like she used on her previous albums."
1,WARNING,This wire is a rip-off. It is NOT 12 awg stranded wire. It is 16 or 18 awg worth of wire wrapped around a cotton core to make it look like 12 gauge.
1,Time consuming and frustrating,"I bought this cable to connect my 2 subwoofers to my home audio system as I did some moving of furniture and my current cables were too short. Home Depot and Lowes did not carry 12 gauge cable which is what I like to use as my subs are pushing 250 RMS watts each and I want to make sure I get solid cable and solid bass. The plastic they covered this cable with is a trial to strip and the two strand is nearly an inch thick, way too thick for 12 gauge cable. The connectors they provided were a complete waste of time, in order to get the connector to stay on, you had to crimp it down so hard you were completely splitting the copper. So once it was connected, if something bumps the sub, the cable would come loose. I ended up going to a car audio store and buying their 12 gauge cable which cost more but was much easier to work with."
2,so-so quality,a lot of the puzzels on the list would not work correctly.I was a little disspointed. The quality of the graphics low.
1,It Sucked,This One Sucked... If You Want To Buy A Puzzle Game Make Sure It's A Egames One.. Egames Is The Best..
1,Can you rate less than 1?,"I was very disappointed with this CD. I can't get very many puzzles to work properly. I'v tried everything, but still can't get past the horrible graphics, or in some cases, puzzles with blue screen. What's up with this thing?"
3,Different,"Worked as described, though not sure I will get much use from it. Worked well under Windows 7, I have yet to try under Windows 8"
1,Augh! avoid this.,"Over 1,000 MB installed on my computer for boring puzzle shapes - 3D environment is a slanted puzzle that makes it impossible to view, click and drag pieces without resizing view. I love a challenging puzzle - NOT challenging software interfaces. Don't let the 1000 puzzles tempt you, I'm a puzzle addict and only could only tolerate it for two puzzles."
1,It is a peice of junk!,"I bought 1 of these VCR's and liked it and then bought another 1 for my sons room.During some bad weather the lights went out then came back on after about an hour.These peices of junk did'nt work anymore,I found it strange that the only electroic equipment that went out were these ""SHARP VCR's"" I took them to a VCR shop and the guy told me that SHARP makes these VCR's with cheap no good parts. I am out 2 VCR's and($).I am so disapointed with ... Company.They told me that it was not thier fault.Let me stress all my other electonic equipment was fine! ..."
3,Perfect for the kids!,This is a great low end VCR with a matching price tag that makes you feel confident putting it in the toy room! I really wanted a unit that had front connectors so we can make tapes from our digital video camera.
4,Decent VCR,I've had the VCR for almost a year. No problems as of yet. Lacks some features of more expensive VCR's.
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this remix. I had anticipated an exploration/expansion of the haunting Survivor theme song. This remix seems to be dance version with a heavy, and monotonous disco beat, in contradiction to the melodic, haunting quality of the original song. The effect is jarring. Each track sounds the same as the one before it. I was extrmely diappointed."
2,not for me,"I bought and used this as a test. I have oily skin which causes the acne so I was looking for a soap that would keep my face free of oil for a substantial amount of time. Not forever, but at least half a day. This soap did not even last an hour. And I've recently stopped having breakouts, but two uses of this product and I had a brand new large pimple that grew fast. I gave this product 2 stars because even though I hate it, I understand from other reviews that it may benefit others and just may not be for my skin."
3,doesnt suite my skin,"after using this soap for 1 week, I had breakouts in my face. they're not terrible at all (as if cystic), but looks like pin point rashes. my face in overall is more red than it used to be, a sign of allergy to one of its ingredients. upon reading its back cover, i found vitamin e in its list. that might be the culprit as my skin is never friendly with tocopherol throughout history. now im back to using my sulfur soap."
1,Not Impressed,"We purchased this system to do some light hot air rework with small electrical components and it's not working very well. The 968 does not display degrees in Fahrenheit and it's not heating up to an acceptable level to melt solder paste.The unit has very little air flow when turned up all the way, and the temperature keeps dropping while we are trying to use it, even though we have it set properly on the display. The airflow ball is also not functioning and barely moves.We cannot pull it off with this equipment.I would save the money and get a better quality rework station."
2,"Vibrates like mad , Short Air wand tube.","I don't know if this is usual but my Aoyue station vibrates more then all the porn stars sex toys combined, I had to make a springboard with rubber mounts so I wouldn't vibrate components off."
4,Very nice for rework,"This is an excellent unit for the price, esp. for the hobbyist doing component repositioning or removal. The only flaw on the one I received was a missing LED indicating the on/off status of the hot air gun, which I can live without (but for which I dinged it one star.) I especially like the temperature display which continues to show the temperature as it drops after you've shut the unit off; this is a great safety feature which helps keep others from getting burned."
4,Great Kit....can't find a cheaper price.,"No big complaints really great kit.Pros:-Heats iron up in no time at all...I'm so used to walking away and doing something else but this thing is perfect.-Looks profession and actually box is nice and heavy...feels solid-Cheap as all heck-Vacuum Really is nice...I don't have to hold my breath now ^^-Holder actually isn't bad. The holder is metal, decent quality, and the solder comes out the bottom so it actually has a nice smooth soldering wire flowCons-Soldering Iron feels cheap and the base can get a tad bit hot. If you don't want the vacuum that it isn't a bad idea to upgrade to a rubber soldering iron-Only has one port so you will only be able to use one iron...no big deal but I know some people don't like that"
4,solid performer,"I don't like the soldering iron stand, I built my own from some stuff I had laying around.Other than that, it's the best solder kit I've ever owned. The hot air blower is good for all kinds of tasks."
2,Worked great - twice,"The title says it all. I've used this successfully exactly two times. Ever since then, the hot air can't even melt shrink tubing, the fume intake runs constantly, and the soldering iron gets lukewarm. I've followed all their troubleshooting advice about resets and a variety of outlets (including a voltage regulated one) to no avail. I haven't been able to get any response from the manufacturer on a warranty replacement. Consider it a $170 throwaway tool - they have some serious QC problems.EDIT: A friend gave me another email address to try for them, and they answered within 24 hours so I bumped it up a star for the fast response. I've submitted my information and will update this review when I hear back again."
2,"Ok soap, not really worth the week I spent using it","I've been looking for a soap to clear my breakouts and this one was kind of a disappointment. I used it on my body and my face, and didn't get the results I was hoping for at all. It wasn't the worst soap I've tried, but it's low on the list."
5,Love this soap!,"This soap makes you feel the absolute cleanest you can feel. Been using in shower for all over freshness since I was about 14 years old. Still love it at 58! Can't find locally anywhere anymore. Walgreens used to carry it as well as some supermarkets, but haven't been able to find except on-line for several years."
3,Good antibacterial soap,"Not the best for my combo skin type, but I was told it was a great product which is why I purchased. For sensitive skin users; use soap less and product might be more effective. Yet, great for antibacterial purposes."
3,not as good as advertised,"don't buy if your problems are multiple, better buy a stronger product. not worth all the hype"
4,Scrub-a-dub-dub,"I received this item FASTER than I thought I would. It has a nice fragrance and appears to be doing exactly what it claims! I had some very stubborn acne and upon using it for a week, the severity of it has diminished. Thanks for providing me with clearer skin conditions and a feeling of better self esteem!"
3,A trekker's experience on Kili,"This book wouldn't interest a technical climber in the least. However, if you are a trekker planning a trip to Kilimanjaro, and have no experience with altitude sickness, this book will help you understand why you need to prepare. The author was clearly unprepared for the Umbwe/Mweka Route and recklessly pushed himself beyond his limits.Also, the book focused too much on the author's personal belief system and sense of personal achievement.However, I did appreciate the author's attempt to share his encounter with Kilimanjaro and found his writing style easy enough to read.As a person having gone through the preparation to climb Kili myself, I'd highly recommend the book 'Kilimanjaro & Mount Kenya: A Climbing and Trekking Guide' by Cameron M. Burns. I'd also recommend learning all that you can about the dangers of altitude sickness. People die every year on Kili. Be prepared! And recognize when you've gone too far."
5,Awesome,Last official studio recordings and as good as the first ones... some are rare and unique editions that are only contained in this disc...
5,MUST HAVE,"If youre used to Heroes De Silencio, Rarezas will ""feel"" a little different but after a while you wont be able to live with out it. A couple of great song and many old song in different versions. Here is La Chispa Adecuada in ""fast"" version. Apuesta por el Rock And Roll might also teach you something abaout your own life."
5,A wonderful reference book,"Before I purchased this book, I struggled to find something that I could refer to quickly when I spotted a bird at my feeder. Not only did this book provide me with basic features such as nesting habits, song descriptions, and typical diets of each bird, it also gave vital information on how to attract these fascinating little guys into your yard through the use of water, food, shelter, & shrubs and flowers. The photos are fantastic as well. I find myself referring to this book constantly, and keep it right by my binoculars."
5,Great birdbook,I purchased this book for my 84 year old mother-in-law. It has excellent pictures and info. She has been able to identify more birds in her back yard.
4,Great new ideas,After redoing our backyard this summer and reading this book. We came up with great new ideas to attract more birds. Thanks.
4,Very Good,"Very good book, has lots of information beyond just bird identification. Only thing I would have done different is have pictures of both the male and female (typically each kind of bird only has one picture)."
4,Audubon Backyard Birdwatcher,"This is a good start for the beginner. It will encourage you to learnmore about birds, feeders,seeds & plants. Some of what I call commonbackyard birds does not show up in this book. Just a little dis-appointmentin that section. I would recommend as a buy."
5,bird behavior as well as appearance,This book was special in that it offers observations of life and behavior as well s appearance.
5,Happy Happy,"Purchased The Audubon Backyard Birdwatcher: Birdfeeders and Bird Gardens for my mother for Christmas, she is very pleased with the book, more so then her other books she has collected for Bird Watching."
4,"Complete Information but has too large a ""footprint""","This guide has a wealth of information, but it is not as easy to use as some others, and I find it is physically larger than I would like. Consequently I also have purchased the NGC ""Backyard Birds"" guide, which has sufficient info and great photos, and is smaller."
5,Excellent Book-Beautiful Pictures!,"This book is fantastic. It is everything it was described to be, and fits our lifestyle watching our birds at our home.The colors and the description is perfect. We have already found several birds in this book from seeing them in our yard where we feed them everyday, that we wasn't sure of what kind they were....Perfect Gift for anybody that is caught up in the beauty of watching birds. I gave this to my husband for his birthday, but no only do we both enjoy, our grandkids love looking up birds they see in the yard and finding the name of each one..."
3,smaller than i thought,its tiny... the bag is useless. definitely not met for growing kids. my son only play with the basketball and the soccer ball for like 5 minutes and then i over it. its more useful s a rattle than the function of a ball.
3,Needs some work,"My son is now 20 months old and has had this toy since he was 12 months. The balls are great - durable, good size for his hands, cute, have interesting sounds, and don't injure us or the furniture as he's developing his aim. However, the bag has been frustrating for him (and us) as the opening is too small for him to maneuver both his hand and one of the larger balls like the football out. If they redid the bag so the opening was just a little bigger, it would be perfect!I also agree with the other reviewer that having 4 pieces in the set has been great; if we lose one ball temporarily, he doesn't even notice!"
4,Excecllent,"Always impressed with Melissa and Doug. Thank you for the speedy shipping, especially during the Christmas season. I look forward to future transactions with you."
4,"fun toy but not really a ""fill & spill""","This toy is cute and my baby likes it; my only complaint is that it's hard for a baby to get the balls in & out of the bag (you definitely can't just turn the bag upside down and ""spill"" them). But I think the balls alone are a worthwhile purchase so I'm glad I bought this."
3,"OK toy, not my favoriet Melissa and Doug toy though","As you read this review, keep in mind it's being used by our 12 month old son. He likes that each ball makes a different noise (crinkle, shakes, squeaks, etc.) but they are all a little too big for his hands so he has a hard time picking them up on his own. Maybe they'll be easier for him to use when he's a little bigger. The bag is nice for storage, but opening is too small for him to actually put more than 1 or 2 balls in and easily get them out. If all 4 balls are in the bag, he gets frustrated trying to get them out. But, like I said, I'll see how he likes it when he's a little older. The bag and each ball are high quality and sturdy. I suspect they'll hold up well to being washed. Melissa and Doug is one of my FAVORITE brands of toys. So even their toys that are spectacular are still better than most other toys you can buy!!!!"
3,Nice toys for toddlers,The Product is quite nice for toddlers. The balls are soft and the colors should attract kids. All the balls are machine washable that is an added advantage.
4,Great Quality to Value Ratio !,"The quality of this TV is just great considering the cost. So good of a ratio I went back and bought a second. The only thing about the TV that could be better is slightly less Curvature to the Picture Tube. But If you want that, be prepared to pay quite a bit more !"
4,Great golf Organizer for garage,Great product. I was amazed the small packaging when I received the product and agree with others that it take some time to setup.
3,Your buying a project.,Like buying model car as a kid this thing is a chore. Instructions are picture only and very vague. Great finished project and it's absolutly do-able though.
4,Performs as Advertised,This product performs as advertised. It helped me get my golf equipment organized and stored in one place. The assembly instruction were sufficient. The one thing that help me from a previous review was to be aware that the outside pieces are specific to the left and right sides. It takes about an hour to assemble and went together fairly easily. It holds both my golf bag and my wifes bag as well as our shoes and miscellaneous equipment. I am definitely happy with my purchase.
4,Does as advertised,"Great little storage unit for dealing with golf clubs and accessories. Finally, everything in one place."
2,NOT worth the money,thought it would be better quality since it was 100 dollars. the wire shelves are cheap and dont fit in correct. pretty disappointed how heavy duty it is.
2,Sport Golf Organizer Metal,"When we received this organizer,we realize that it have several missing parts,so we send it back,and Amazon refund us."
4,Great Storage Unit,"Easy to assemble, lot's of room to store all of your stuff, and a decent price. You can't go wrong with this. Pick it up while it is still available. I looked at quite a few units before buying this one. I pretty much rolled the dice based solely on the reviews written here. I was not mislead. If you are in the market for some golf storage, go for it. I have two sets of clubs in the unit. One of them is actually a very large Cleveland staff cart bag. Fits like a glove."
5,mtal golf organizer,this organizer holds up to 4 sets of junior clubs and 2 full sets of adult clubs. The racks in thecenter hold 2 pairs of shoes on each level. I like the apron in the front. It holds the clubs insnug and they do not fall over.
1,"Flex pin set incomplete, not worth it.",This flex pin set requires an additional part: You have to purchase a base that attaches to the speaker wire/cable and then the flex pin screws into this base. Why this set is not packaged and sold as a complete set?? I guess to make more money. I did e-mail Acoustic Research concerning this. All they had to say--you need purchase the base for each flex pin. I feel I was mislead and did not feell it was worth it to spend more time and money on this product. I returned both of my flex pin sets.
1,"Bad copies, Bad Live Bad!","Nothing, zero, walk away. I can't believe how bad this and the rest of this Legacy Entertainment company offering are of this series.At .05 cents for a copy...it's still to much."
4,Love OPI!,"Love OPI polish, it lasts longer than other brands. Wasn't too impressed with this color, not quite what I expected. Fast shipping."
1,"Ladle is very big, and lacks stainless finish","Ladle is too big for home use. Looks more like a ladle for a restaurant cookpot, stew for 10 people. Also does not have the stainless shine as depicted in the photograph."
5,Soap I can't get anywhere else,It's great to be able to order my favorite soap--I'm allergic to most others--on-line.I wasn't able to find the soap bars anywhere in my area and was frustrated. So I'm very pleased with my ability to find the product through Amazon.com.
2,"some worth reading, several not","This collection of short stories from Jack Ketchum didn't impress me that much. A few of the stories were excellent. Some were good. Several were just not worth reading at all. The good stories I wish were full-length novels. I thought all of the stories ended unresolved, the weaker ones without a point at all. I was also disappointed in the women's roles throughout the stories (most women I know aren't obsessed with breasts as the females in this collection seem to be). It just makes it read in an unbelievable manner - when a story is supossed to be written by woman from her point of view, and it's all about female body parts, it's obviously written by a man. I got this book because of praise from Stephen King and The Girl Next Door. I also have Off Season, but didn't read that one yet. I hope in a novel Ketchum presents a better package."
3,it is ok,"Some of these stories are genuinely creepy. The problem is, none of them feel like they are finished. They are all about 10 pages of buildup, and then a quick half page to end the story and thats that. Short stories should still have a beginning a middle and an end. While the buildup seems to be very good, the endings feel like he just got tired of writing the story and stuffed a quick ending on it, often times one that pretty much leaves everything open. I dont mind open ended stories from time to time, but it seems everyone of these is so incomplete. Think this collection would have been much better if it had less stories, but they were each 20-30 pages."
4,better than most,"I don't usually like short horror stories but this novel was pretty good.I think it's because he pulls no punches, and always manages to get keep you interested."
2,Not Memorable.,"I was extremely disappointed in this collection from one of my favorite authors. Sure there are some excellent stories in this novel. All of which won the Bram Stoker award, Gone, The Box, and Closing Time. The last story firedance was also a refreshing change for ketchum fans, but 70% of the book was clearly filler material. I really didn't enjoy the 10 page short story format. Even though you can get 30 stories in a book, they all seemed incomplete in some way. I always finished a story wishing there were about 10 more pages.Also alot of the stories lacked the edge that jack ketchum's novels usually have. It was almost like they packaged this set together to rival a Stephen King collection, even though ketchum's style is completely different.I would reccommend this novel as a starter for new ketchum readers but not to his faithful ""Hardcore"" followers."
2,Not his best but has its' moments,"While this collection of short stories varies in quality I didn't really see anything outstanding here. Many of the stories have attempts at ""gotcha"" style endings, like an old episode of Twilight Zone, and for me they didn't seem to succeed.Having said that, there are still some selections here to interest Ketchum fans. Closing Time generates a great deal of tension, Gone is heartbreaking, and The Rose is one of the most disgusting and disturbing things I've ever read. There are also 2 stories that take place after a zombie plague has struck. Ketchums' other books like the Offspring and Hide & Seek are excellent."
5,Throckmorton's Gospel Parallels perfect fit for class or individual,This book was recommended by the scripture scholar teaching our class. It is easy to use and follow.This older edition is used by instructor - no complaints.
2,For die hard Deborah Harry fans only,"And I thought ""Command and Obey"" was bad! A real disappointment. Production is poor and the song is boring. ""Strike Me Pink"" its not. I don't even think this one will grow on me. For Deborah Harry completists only (which I am). I hate giving anything of hers a bad review but in German or English this song goes down with ""Backfired"" as one of her worst."
4,"A mild chocolate flavor, not bad","I thought these had an OK mild chocolate flavor. I prefer Pamela's gluten free cookies. These are nice and soft and my toddler enjoys them, so I will probably buy again for her. A slightly grainy texture, but that wouldn't bother me if they had a stronger chocolate flavor. You can taste the date paste used as one of the sweeteners."
3,"Not the best, but pretty good for SF and GF","I can't have soy or gluten, so my choices of cookies are very limited unless I make my own. And making your own isn't something you will always have time to do. So when I wanted a quick fix I tried these and thought they were ""good enough"" for being one of the only SF and GF cookies I can eat.I like the texture, chewy in a brownie type way, not overly dry or moist. Easy to pop in your mouthI feel like they could be chocolaty-er though. I was eating them thinking they tasted ""chocolate-ish"" and then looked at the ingredients and it said 'date paste' near the top, which is totally what I was tasting. Those of you who eat dates know they can have a rich taste, similar to chocolate. Overall, they are good enough I think. I ate the whole box, which is a sign that they weren't bad enough to throw them away. Which is what usually happens when I try different GF cookies. They kind of taste like a healthier version of a chocolate brownie cookie."
2,"Edible, But Not as Good As Hoped For","I must start off by saying that I really really love the Enjoy Life gluten-free Snickerdoodle cookies...even if they don't taste exactly like snickerdoodles. So I thought I would try this flavor and ended up being disappointed.These Double Chocolate Brownie Cookies are a bit dry and don't really have much chocolate flavor when it comes right down to it. Certainly, they don't taste like brownies, not even a good gluten-free brownie. If you do buy them, eat them right away, because they get even more dry by the next day.Instead, I'd recommend French Meadow's gluten-free brownies which actually have a lot of chocolate flavor, are soft, and taste good whether you eat them right out of the freezer or heat them up in the microwave."
3,Doughy and grainy texture (and SMALL size),"These don't taste like brownies or cookies, more like grainy cookie dough. They are tiny too, more like brownie ""bits."" To be fair, they are chocolatey, but the chocolate chips are pathetic and clash with the texture of the cookie. These are similar to Nana's gluten free cookies, which I don't care for either. Pamela's cookies are much better (http://www.amazon.com/Pamelas-Products-Chocolate-Chocolate-Cookies-5-29-Ounce/dp/B000DZH19U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1335229020&sr=8-1)."
4,Yummy,"Length:: 0:26 MinsThese small cookies are quite yummy. The flavor is bold and strong. If you are going to grab a little snack after dinner, you want something that makes a statement. These are perfect. Great with tea or coffee."
1,I couldn't even finish eating 1....,"I don't know what the others who gave this a good review ate but it is not what I got! I tried these and I couldn't even finish the one I was eating. I took 1 bite and threw the rest away. As did my husband. I then threw the whole bag away. They were grainy, dry, and not chocolaty at all. Seriously gross."
3,Alright but not great,"I've been sampling different gluten free cookies. These ones have a certain taste that reminds me of ones that I got at Wholefoods. It's not exactly tasty--a little... something. I suppose you could get used to these and enjoy them--they are free of ""most things"" and so it might be a good option for some people. They are soft on the inside, which is nice. There is a ""je ne sais quoi"" missing from these, though.I think the Pamela's cookies are much better, although they have egg in them. I'd say the Mi-del are also better, although they have more stuff too."
2,NUTRITION FACTS LISTED HERE ARE WRONG! 130 calories . .,"My big problem with this product has more to do w/ incorrect nutritional information than any comments I can/will make about flavor. The cookie serving on the box reads 130 calories not 120, 5g of fat and 110mg or 5% sodium which is high considering this is only for TWO small (1 inch?) cookies. Sodium is actually a concern for many people so I'm a little disappointed by this irresponsible post. I would have chosen another variety if I had known the actual figures.Update: Apparently the erroneous information is Enjoy Life's fault not Amazon's. I find it very bad that a business of this size cannot be bothered to check what they have listed on their website. For that, I am downgrading my review to a 2. How can I be sure that they haven't inadvertently neglected to list an item in their ingredient list that I may be allergic to because they couldn't be bothered w/ details?"
5,These area lifesaver!,"This are very tasty and chocolaty. Being on an elimination diet for my nursing baby can be hard, products like this make it so much easier! To be able to eat a cookie when there are so many things I can't eat is beyond wonderful."
2,"Terrible value, decent cookie.","For the size of the box, the amount of product you get is absolutely ridiculous. It's 12 very tiny cookies. The cookies taste decent, but it's a poor value, and terribly inefficient packaging to boot."
5,Expensive BUT OH SO GOOD.,"I've got a dairy allergy, my mom is gluten free, and my grandma is dairy and gluten free. We're always on the look out for something good. And these are it! This cookies are addicting! They're on the small side and fairly expensive, but so is most gluten and diary free food. They're incredibly good for you, made with date paste (which you can't taste), and sweetened with juice concentrates. Lower in sugar, and they have fiber! But they're oh so chocolaty and hit the spot. I highly recommend."
5,Great cookie and best price!,"My son is on a gluten free and casein free diet for 3 years now, and also allergic to soy, and these cookies have been a welcome fun addition to his diet. They're his favorite with the chocolate chips one. They are very chocolatey, not overly sweet, and have a chewy texture (not chalky). They are not really like brownies but taste more like a regular soft chocolate cookie. The cookies are great (like most of Enjoy Life products) but a little pricey, there are only 12 in the box. We go through a lot of those since my 14 months old baby started eating them too!...I am thrilled (and editing my previous review accordingly) to see that Amazon now sells those directly! (it used to be through an outside seller with outstanding shipping charges). Let alone the convenience of getting them on my doorstep, this is the better price I have found anywhere! :-)"
2,Protect Error,This stereo is a wicket stereo but it breaks easy and all kinds of errors comes up on the Display Lights..and whats the problem with Protect Error on it anywayz
1,I'm sorry that I couldn't give it less than one star,This is what I get for trying to save a few dollars. This book is totally unreadable. I couldn't get through one page without falling asleep. It was like someone just came up with a series of random thoughts and put them on paper. There was no organization at all. I would be amazed if one person passed using this book alone.
1,unhappy customer,"The Casio keyboard is fine the ad indicated I was buying keyboard stand, andac adapter. Received only the keyboard contacted amazon, their answer wassorry here is the e-mail address and telephone of company sending keyboard,call them said not their fault amazon not their fault finally referred toCasio company. After at least 7 - 10 calls and e-mail by the ton. Theyfinally agreed to refund $25. I strongly felt that this problem should havebeen solved by amazon since they were the company that accepted my payment.They simply said we can get your money back but it is your problem, verydisappointed in the service."
5,Educational fun for toddlers,"This Maisy DVD was an instant hit with my two year old.It has some good topics covered too including numbers,ABC, Maisy's farm,and Colours.The ABC section is good as it shows Lower and Upper case letters and says the letter phonetically too.Perfect for little ones and one of the better things they can watch if they have to watch TV."
1,Good Morning Maisy on DVD,"I recently bought this DVD, but I will NOT be buying the other two Maisy DVD's. Yes, my child likes the program, but it's too time consuming to sit through all of the trailers at the beginning of the program. Universal does not allow their consumers to press Menu or Chapter Skip. The only way to get past the trailers is to press the fast forward button - like we used to do with videos.I also think it is rather irritating that Universal included a Maisy trailer on a Maisy DVD! How ridiculous is that?I don't have as much of an issue with trailers on a live action title, but it's silly to have so many trailers on an animated kid's title that you know will be played over and over again.I'll go back to buying children's titles from other Studios and avoid titles from Universal."
4,Forced to watch 10 minutes of trailers before Maisy!!!!,"My daughter likes Maisy, but the DVD annoyingly forces you to watch 10 minutes of advertisements before you can start to watch the show! If anyone figures out how to bypass this annoyance, please let me know. There are many other quality videos for the little ones that don't do this."
4,Baby *loves* Maisy!,"My 6 month old son just loves Maisy. Anytime he hears the theme song he breaks out into a *huge* grin! He has enjoyed the show since he was about 3-4 months old, so we got him the Good Morning Maisy DVD. It's a hit!! There are several songs on it that he adores, including ""I Like Trucks"" and ""Oats, Beans & Barley."" And with over 2 hours of Maisy segments on the DVD, there is plenty to choose from.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the trailer at the beginning...you have to fast-forward through it which is a pain. Another thing I dislike is that a new voice for the storyteller is used on some of the segments (like Maisy's Farm). It's different from the voice on the television show and most of the other video segments. I don't know if this bothers my son or not but it always seems ""wrong"" to me when I hear it! Other than that, a great DVD!"
1,Too Many Advertisements,"The movie had so many ad's at the beginning, that you can't skip through, that my child was bored before the movie started."
2,Terrible...!!,"We like the ""Maisy"" books -- good, simple, colorful stories, not a lot of intellectual heft. But good golly, these animated shorts are just terrible!!! The narrator sounds completely bored (and secretly contemptuous of the material) and the character voices consist mainly of moronic giggle-babbles that sound a lot like the TeleTubbies. It's really insulting to the intelligence of even the youngest viewers. Plus, the age group that this is suited to developmentally (one-year olds) shouldn't be watching videos anyway: recent studies suggest that watching TV -- any kind of TV -- in the first two years of life holds back language development and shortens attention span. This video is not worth the risk. (Axton)"
2,Not worth the money,"This has been the only thing that has disappointed me about my C10SFH. I was hoping that it would help keep long pieces of crown in alignment for cuts on the ends of boards when you have a more than half of the piece hanging off of the saw stand. I have found that it holds the piece close but I still need to fine tune the alignment with pressure from my hand. I works well for cuts in the middle of the board where the board is against both crown stops.I think there still may be some circumstances that it might be useful, but so far it has just gotten in the way. I have only used it on 45/45 crown. I haven't tried it on 38/52 crown yet. If I find a instance that it works well I will update my review and let you know.I think crown stops and a good support stand would be a much better investment."
4,Why isn't this being played more today?,Great original music and a vantage point that seems to be totally current with the meltdown and all. Good live show too.
1,Don't like this at all,"I own a dog daycare center and we had a difficult time hearing on a 'regular' phone. I purchased this phone in hopes that the amplification would help, it didn't. Basically the phone completely amplifies all the background noise and it made hearing the person on the other end impossible. I guess it would be good if you are just using them in your home or a quiet environment, but NOT in a place with any background noise."
5,Appropriate Packaging,"Package does not state it is for those with hearing loss, which was a major plus! Don't want to offend grandma. Maybe this is why she received two."
1,Products returned,"I am very sorry that I had to return the three phones. My wife is legally blind, and she was unable to see the buttons,(too small) and she couldn't read the printing on the small screen. Thank you for your very liberal return policy.Richard A. Levi"
4,phone for elderly,"the phone is great. it is very loud so my dad can hear it. it has flashing lighs so when he has his earphones on for the tv he can see it ringing. he can hear better because it is amplified. my sister programed the numbers for him and that took some time for him to understand and adapt to because he ""can't"" hear."
4,large faced phone,"I purchased this item for a replacement for my 85 year old mother. Being sight and hearing impaired, this phone has great features with few extras that only confuse the elderly. Easy set up and programming made this item a hit with her, now she can visibly see when a call is coming in and the hearing boost makes it easier for her to hear whle using. Price was fantastic for a Uniden, which I believe is a quality phone."
4,Very Pleased,Real nice phone for the money. Very easy to use & the large screen/buttons make it very user-friendly. It's my 2nd Uniden 900 mhz phone and it works awesome.
5,THIS IS A GREAT PHONE!!,"This phone is GREAT!! I wear glasses and have low vision, but do not need one of those giant BIG button phones, well this phone is superb, the buttons are big, but not too huge. heck, they look normal size to me, not so teeny-tiny like all the phone makers are making them nowadays lol. and that is what i was looking for. the 2nd plus, is that you can actually cleaarly read the caller i.d. area, it too, is larger. thirdly, as an extra bonus, the audio on the phone is adjustable. i'm not hard of hearing yet, i'm only 49, but do have one ear that is better than the other. well now i can adjust the volume to fit both ears comfortably. all in all, this is a superb phone and i heartily recommend it!"
4,"Easy to leave ""off hook""","I bought one of these phones for my 94 y.o. mother who has nearly lost her eyesight due to macular degeneration. The phone works well enough, but the single Talk button toggles the hang-up function on and off. She can't tell very easiy whether she hit the Talk button and actually hung up. Consequently she has left the phone off-hook for many hours on several occasions. It would be better to have separate Talk and Hang-up buttons like cell phones have and also a bright red light on the phone to indicate the line is in use. The Talk button should also have a raised nipple or ring around it so that the person can easily feel when the button is under the finger."
4,Great for no interference,"I bought this phone for it's 900 MHz feature which doesn't interfere with our wireless network or other electronic equipment - or should I say they don't interfere with this phone. We have a 5.8 MHz Uniden that has a short range due to the wireless interference, according to the Uniden tech support I spoke to. I am not elderly but still appreciate most features.The cons:-No speakerphone.-Can't use the phone when sitting on base - needs to be charged to use.-When dialing, the tone when dialing out is very loud - painful to the ear. The audio boost feature is off.The pros:Large buttons, easy to push with long nailsHas a input jack to use headphones with (they don't come with phone)Easy to change volume while in callI had few phones to choose from in the 900 MHz range, so the only thing that would lead me to buy another 900 MHz would be if it had a speakerphone, a full featured base, and expandable handsets."
4,uniden cordless phone,"great looking phone with big numbers and light up ringer! Would have rated it with 5 stars, but does not have a speaker phone feature."
4,Great sound on this phone,"This phone is very, very compatible for hard of hearing customers and the fact that it is portable with great sound is wonderful."
1,Cordless Phone,"I waa so excited when I ordered this phone. I was having problems hearing on my old cordless phone and I thought the volume boost was just what I needed. I also liked the idea of having a large caller ID display.What a disaapointment.The phone cuts in and out constantly, it either blasts you out or you hear nothing. You cannot go 10 feet away from the base without loosing your connection. The caller ID is large but not illuminated as implied.Do not buy this product if you need a decent phone."
5,wonderful for hard of hearing,"I've gotten to where I hate answerring the phone. Can't quite make out what some peopls say. This solved my problem, and its inexpensive."
3,Not for Persons with Significant Hearing Loss,"I bought this phone for a parent with progressive, nerve-based hearing loss, but the phone does not have sufficient feedback suppression technology. Turning the volume up more than 3/4 with Audio Boost turned on resulted in feedback, and the phone was not capable of achieving a crisp, clear sound at a high enough volume for my parent to hear. The phone is hearing aid compatible, and for persons with mild hearing loss it is probably fine. I returned mine."
2,Not so great....,"I bought this for my 80 year old Mother. I read all the reviews and it sounded pretty good. I set it up for my Mom, and tested it. The biggest problem is that if you turn the volume up on the earpiece, so she can hear the person on the other end, it reverberates so much, that all you can hear is yourself! I was really disappointed in this. Please, don't buy this if someone really has trouble hearing, it is not worth the money. I have it up for sale on EBay."
5,uniden for impaired,"I am very pleased with my new Uniden phone. The numbers are large and easy to read. The volume is easily adjusted and adequate for my hearing loss. I like the fact that it flashes ""red"" when it rings. Also, it holds a charge for a long time All and all it is the best phone in the house. I walk with a walker and keep the phone in a pocket on the Hugo all the time. It is my safety net and much easier to use than my cell phone."
5,Great phone,"The voice quality and reception is outstanding. I've tried the 2.4's and 5.8's. This phone leaves them in the dust. I didn't need another phone at this moment in time, but I just purchased another one in the event they stop producing them."
5,This Phone's Ring Is Amazing!!,"I am a semi deaf senior citizen who has been searching for a phone that will let me know when it rings. Gadzooks! This product gets the job done. Two ways. First, the ring tone is low pitched and LOUD. Almost impossible not to hear when a call comes in. Second, there is a brilliant flashing Red Light that accompanies the ring. If you don't hear it, you will see it! Same flashing light tells you there is a voice mail waiting. The receiver volume is also great. Even with my bsd ears, I have not had to go above medium. The price is right, the product lives up to it's hype. I like it!"
4,Visually impaired phone,I bought this phone for my mother-in-law who is legally blind andneeded a cordless phone. The larger buttons make it easier for herto use. Very well satisfied with this product.
5,THIS PHONE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT,"My 91-year-old dad is a little hard of hearing and occasionally doesn't hear the phone ring. This phone is great because the ringer is LOUD and the phone and base light up and flash when phone rings.Plus the ""find my phone"" feature is great. Let's say your phone is under a pillow. Phone is ringing. Phone is temporarily lost. Go to the base and press ""find my phone"" or whatever the button says and the phone starts loudly BEEPING for 60 seconds. The answering machine has picked up by this point but the beeping continues for 60 seconds. If you still can't find the phone in those 60 seconds, you call your number with your cell phone, hear the phone ring, press the magic button on the base, and continue your hunt. It's a loud beep so believe me, you'll find it.GREAT PHONE AND REASONABLE PRICE."
2,A real telephine-line crippler,"The loudness of this telephone is great, the large numbers and buttons are easy to read and to push, and the caller ID works great, the ringer is loud. The only thing wrong is that if you are using it while the batteries go dead, there is almost no warning, and worse, when it goes dead it seizes the line. OK if you know about it, just put it back on the charger right away and all will be OK. But if you don't, nobody will be able to call you, and you won't be able to call out no matter which phone in your house you try. This is potentially dangerous. If you had an emergency, and needed to dial 911, and didn't know about this problem, your life would be potentially lost because you can't even get a dial tone."
4,The Conti Castile soap was similar to other ...,"The Conti Castile soap was similar to other castile soaps, although it had a milder scent that was less unpleasant. It lathered well and left me feeling clean without leaving a """"soapy"""" feeling on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and I found it wasn't quite mild enough to use on my face. However, it was fine everywhere else. Overall, I like the soap, although it wasn't wonderful enough that I would consider paying full price for it on a regular basis."
3,"Yes, I liked this product. It really improved ...","Yes, I liked this product. It really improved my skin. The soap was a bit slippery to use though. I cannot count the number of times I dropped it in the shower. Also, it seems to be used up a lot faster than a normal bar of soap."
4,"I use bar soap for cleansing, makeup removal ...","I use bar soap for cleansing, makeup removal and moisturizing. I have sensitive skin and need to be careful with what I use. Conti Castile soap did all of these things very well. This is a product that I will continue to use and would recommend it to others."
2,product criterium,I did not recieve the cable ends and or accessories that was supposed to have been shipped with the spool of wire as shown in photos at the time of sale/purchase. Therefore this is now the second time in as many purchases that the product I desired to purchase was inadequet and misleading. Very disaappointed in amazon.com dealings with sellers. Please contact Acoustic research and advise them or I just wonT deal with Amazon any more. Thank you
3,Needs some structure,"(This review is from my wife who thought these items would be good for Christmas storage). These storage ""boxes"" need some structure. You would do better buying cheaper duffle bags or canvas bags if you don't care what the final result in appearance will be. Cannot stack these wet noodles. It's like throwing a bunch of sandbags together on a shelf. A rib system, or some cardboard fillers would help tremendously. Probably would be good to store linens, or clothing, as long as you fill them to capacity. Truly wish I hadn't spent the money."
3,soft sided,"The ""boxes"" are nice yet are not hard sided as I had hoped. The buying process was great - easy payment and very fast shipment. I think I got them in record time!"
3,Good entry level powered subwoofer,"I recently bought one of those metallic looking micro systems. Although it sounded really good, my bass craving was not satisfied. I immediately realized the need for a subwoofer. This KLH subwoofer was the smallest one I found. For the price, I thought ""what the heck"" I'll give it a try! I just got it a couple of days ago and it did what I expected. So if you own one of those mini components and you want it to sound better, look no further, this is a pretty good entry level powered subwoofer. POSITIVES :o) *Price, biggest bang for your buck. *Size, you can place it almost anywhere *Versatility, small home theaters/mini components/PC's *Rugged Finish-- NEGATIVES :o( *It produces a subtle hum even when the source is turned off. *No automatic shut off. *The only cables included are for PC applications. *Can only compliment a small size room."
4,Great Little Giant,"I added this subwoofer to my home theater system and what a surprise! It's small enough to fit just about anywhere, can fill a moderate size room with tight solid bass, and the cabinet doesn't rattle at high volumes. I thought my large main speakers would drown it out, but the LFE channel sends different lows to the subwoofer that I never heard until now. This model lacks some of the fancy control features (which can be adjusted at the receiver level anyway), but it's a great buy for the performance. It fits very well into a 5.1 environment."
3,Too quiet.,"This was the cheapest sub woofer I could find, and it is a fine value for what I paid, but I was hopeing that I was getting a deal.You are getting what you paid for, a little bit of bass added to your system. You will not be finding out that you got a bargian. You will not be finding out that at half volume it is as loud as you can handle. It'll be a very minor, but noticable improvement to your entertainment setup."
2,"Descent, but hey, I guess you get what you pay for, huh?","This klh woofer added a little kick to my aiwa sound system, very little. not only is this sub not that powerful, but it can not handle very low frequency. this sub also has trouble on fast bass lines and gets very sloppy. but if your just looking for a dirt cheap sub then i guess this is what you're going to get, so by all means."
1,"When things go wrong, Support is HORRIBLE!","I purchased a ReplayTV 5060 and within 2 weeks it broke. The product was absolutely amazing... When is was working. I spent 2 1/2 weeks on the phone trying to get the product returned to ReplayTV (because I purchased it directly from them) and they gave me a run-around that was absolutely insulting. When I finally did get it shipped back to them (with my own money), they sent a BROKEN UNIT in its place back. My opinion is to NOT get one of the older models, no matter how cheap the deal is because ReplayTV is awful at keeping customers with broken units happy."
2,Disatisfied to say the least,"I purchased the RTV 5080 in April of this year. When it works it works very well. However if there is a problem you can forget about their customer service. In the past three weeks I have spent in excess of 10 hours on the telephone with their version of customer service. If the problem can not be fixed by someone in India working from a scripted text, you are not going to get it fixed. I have a very basic system, it requires a telephone line to communicate to it's server. However you also need a telephone line to communicate with India, so...... I am not satisifed with my unit, I am now in the process of trying to get a refund so that I can purchase a TIVO. I did not purchase TIVO originally, due partially to the Replay TV's lower monthly charge, however the old saying hold particularly true in this case, you do get what you pay for."
1,The rates go up as SONICblue's stock goes down,"I tried a replay rtv5080 for about A week. The biggest problem was with signal dropouts on any scrambled cable channel. They don't have a fix for this problem so I decided to go with Tivo. By the way Replay's big claim to fame was no charge for subscribing to their service. I see they have started charging, I hope the subscribers don't get burned because Sonic Blue is in big financial trouble and could bail out of the dvr market anytime."
3,Great for the first 18-months...then it died,"I loved the ReplayTV 5160 during it's short life. It has great features, including commercial skip and networking. Maybe I overused it, because now it is a dying old beast. It was new just 18 months ago, but now it freezes every night. It has to be unplugged for a few hours and then it works again when it is plugged in. Too bad I bought the ""lifetime"" subscription to their Guide service!"
3,"Good Idea, In Theory","My wife and I chose Replay over Tivo for basically one reason: the commercial advance feature. The online record requesting is also a great feature. We loved it. Then the box stopped working for some unknown reason. Luckily it was still under the store's warranty (purchased at Good Guys) and they replaced it in store, no problem. The new boxed worked as great as the old one, unfortunately, as this replacment has mysteriously stopped working as well. Now I am having to deal with customer service at SonicBlue which, while being kind, has no idea what they are doing. It has been two months as of today and I still have not been able to get a replacement sent out dispite being told it was on its way multiple times."
1,Where's Customer Service?,"Received my 5160 today with much glee but so far I am sorely disappointed. I connected all the right cables and lines and started the setup process only to be shut out before I could begin. The telephone connection could not be completed! I got some isoteric error number and no other explanation. Do I need the area code? I tried that, no luck. Try another beginning phone number for them to search, no luck. The line is fine, I have no idea why it won't connect.I tried customer ""service"" 4 times now and have been put on hold for over 20 minutes twice (I couldn't wait any longer) and now I can not even get though. Very Poor!I will update this message if I get any satisfaction.MJR"
1,"Great product, lousy support","The 5160 is my second ReplayTV unit. I also have a 4508 that I just love.My problem with the 5160 is that you have to download a humongous operating system update from SonicBlue's network before you can do anything with it, and SonicBlue's network isn't robust enough to handle all the download requests it seems to be getting this Christmas season. My connection kept timing out an hour or two into the download, and as a result it took me three days of trying to finally complete the setup process. Meanwhile, SonicBlue's tech support department was no help at all. Sometimes I couldn't even get through; other times the wait to speak to a representative was over an hour.I'm a fan of SonicBlue's products, but I'd hold off on the 5160 until SonicBlue works the kinks out. To capitalize on the holiday buying season, SonicBlue seems to have rushed these units out the door before they were ready."
1,fast useless help and not for dish network,"I bought the replaytv and I called the tech support 6 times. The wait for the support is the best I have seen the longest wait is like 1 minute. The information that they provide is the most worthless. Each time I called I got a different answer to my problem. One said it was the replaytv unit fault, another said it was my network, another said it was the server and the other three didn't know. The problem was the same error 93a6000b. No one fixed my problem. They didn't listen to what was happening. I wouldn't recommend to anyone with dish. I have dish network but couldn't download the programming for it. I could download Directtv without any problem and if you use cable or a antena the you are in good shape. Did not work with dish. Always get to 92% download and unexcepted error. []was excellent on shipping to me and getting me another one. I would strongly recommend using something else for dish customers. The biggest waste of my time I have spent."
2,Store this in the back of your Edsel!,"Not a bad product, but nobody knows who makes or supports these things any more! Look at whatever PVR your Cable or Sat company has, or just get a TiVo."
1,Think again before buying,"SonicBlue, the company that owns ReplayTV, has filed for bankruptcy. There is little to no chance of getting the rebate that is offered on this product. What will happen to the service for the ReplayTV? Who really knows. Avoid."
1,"poor product, poor support","In the 3 days I owned this, I had the following problems:1.Screen would suddenly go blank with erroneous error message ""program not available""2. when trying to record abc, unit recorded nbc but indicated it was recording abc3. not compatible with sports package such as directv center ice4. I spent one hour on hold but never got to talk to customer support to get help clearing these problems upsome things are just not ment to be- I think an integrated unit of satelite- digital recording might be better- beware if you buy this product and it does not go perfectly- you probably won't get help troubleshooting from the company and the retail outlets seem to be bewildered too."
4,Kickass!,"I wasent really an Endless struggle fan until i heard they're kickass cd Till The End.Id say this is a four star cd, its great!its packed with catchy tunes and its loaded with talent and amazing energy.All i can say is If your into street punk or just intense fast music with rythem pick this up."
2,"Looks good, sounds bad.","While there are many good features to this television (size, easy set up, on-screen display) the sound quality is very poor. There is only one small speaker on the right-hand size, which limits the sound and its quality. However, for a 13"" television, picture quality is very good. I might recommend this t.v. if you are purchasing it for a very small space. Beyond that, pay a little more money and find something else."
5,This book is one of most enlightening books I've read.,"This books is great for beginners and the most experierced witch.INSIDE A WITCHES COVEN tells about how to choose which coven is right for you,and it tells about Coven Magick and Healing Rituals,it tells about Teachind Secrets and Secret Teachings,and meny other points such as Networking and Group Dynamics,The Sensible Way to Join or Create a Coven and much much more."
4,Decent,"I'd give this 3 stars in the field of Wiccan books overall (ok, not great or must have), and 4 stars within the niche of books on Covening given that there's not that wide a range (good, but not must have).Basically, if you're interested in covens or forming a coven, I'd say the two essentials would be Covencrafting by Amber K (more practical focus), and Wicca Covens by Judy Harrow (more group dynamics etc), and after those, this would be my third pick in a very narrow field. I think has a better focus on evaluating an existing coven than Coven forming, but it's also a lot less dense in differing ways than the two other books, which may make it a little less intimidating."
4,Inside a Witches' Coven,"Any Solitary who ever wondered about the logistics of coven entry should read this book. Edain McCoy writes from the heart in an easy-to-read language which tells it like it is. She relates both the upside & downside of working within a coven & gives common-sense guidelines to creating your own. The importance of ettiquette in group settings is stressed & personal experiences are shared with the reader relating to this & other areas of coven-based practices.A good book for anyone who may be worried about finding the right coven for themselves (or wondering if the coven setting is right for them!), or those interested in finding out about that side of the Craft which is shared with like-minded others."
4,INFORMATIVE TO NEWCOMERS,"I found this book very enlightening! If you're not sure whether to join a coven or not, read this book. Basically I liked it! If you're thinking of starting your own coven, this book is definitely a must. It has alot of good ideas."
5,Freaky Dancin!!!,"they were one of the most successful RnB group in history maybe because i like their sweety sounds and their driving style is very funky.this album is must have.i assure you, you won't be frustrated. don't miss out and discover their funkiest world.Freaky Dancin!!!Knights Of RnB!!!!"
5,Different chants; beautifully preformed,"The first cd Chants:Ritual Music of the Reclaiming, the coven of Starhawk, includes basic wicca chants.This follow-up, with the 'orginal' title: Second Chants, has all kind of chanting. Solo, a capella, gospel with cello, guitar, djembe a.o.The booklet includes all 15 lyrics to the chants. From the playlist: Rhiannon, Sparks, Powerful song, Harvest Chant, Inanna, Return to the Goddess,a.o.Personally I like the song ""when we are gone"" Reclaiming brings warm chants, nice to listen en learn. You don't have to be afraid to sing along."
2,too expensive (Ripoff),I bought this product by error thinking that it was the 24 oz bottle this one is too expensive.
5,A must-have when replacing a fuel pump,"Replacing the sock that's attached to the fuel pump is a must, and this is the one I used on my Chevy Caprice. So far no issues, the installation went smoothly, and the car runs like new."
2,"Nice feaures for the money, but poor picture quality","I'm a stickler for honest, accurate skin tones. But no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't get it right with this TV. I finally had to return it and go back to my 14 year old 25"" RCA which has more accurate hues than this Sharp."
2,"Wrong Size, and still haven't recieved return refund.","I bought a bunch of clothes for the fall, including a new pair of adidas Samba Millenium shoes. After ordering adidas shoes (including this variety) for years at the size 10.5 US, I received a pair that was over a size smaller despite the tag's size-insistence. I sprang to have the shoes (and some other clothes) returned the next day.While I have received confirmation of all other returns, and even been refunded, the shoes have still been a no-show. I am much less likely to trust Amazon with clothing orders again anytime soon."
3,Too small,"They runn too small, I'm 8.5 and to be safe I order 9, they were too tigh, on top of that Amazon made me pay for return shipment?.. because it was my mistake!!!!!!!. I don't agree. Shoe runns too small."
5,"Classic Sambas Are Great, The Samba Millenium Is Twice as Good","I have worn the Classic Sambas for quite a while as my general walking around shoe (I wear an older version of the Mundials to play on indoor turf, and I run in Vibrams). I really liked the Classic Sambas. I love the Samba Millenium. They have more arch support and wear much more comfortably than the Classics. They do seem a little bit narrower than the Classic Sambas, but they are not too narrow on me, and that translates into a more secure feel."
2,uncomfortable,"I do not recommend this shoes at all because they are uncomfortable, I felt pain in my muscles and gave me blisters. Nice looking shoes but no more than that."
3,Eh...,Look much better in the picture... Sent them back. Great Indoor Soccer shoe however! Played in the black ones forever!
1,The box size 10 and the shoes 7 !!!,I ordered the shoes before 5 days. my size is 10 I choose 10 today I received the item but the size is wrong it is 7 !! the shoes inside the box is 7 size and the box is 10 I am very disappointment. what I do now ?
1,Deceiving product,I ordered this pair of shoes ( adidas Samba Millenium (White) and it turned out tobe a very low quality product.It was made in Vietnam out of Vietnamese materials.It hurts my feet terribly. T
3,Not nearly as soft as Samba shoes in years gone by,I occasionally use soccer shoes as sneakers and the leather of these new style shoes feels stiffer then it used to. Also the rubber seems to have extended outward noticeably where before the shoe had a narrower profile.Pro: Better for soccer and running on surfacesCons: Not as comfy when used as a sneaker until broken in
3,NICE ......but,"these take a little time to wear in!!! made both my heels bloody the 1st and second time i wore them, i wear a size 10 but had to order a 10 1/2like the look of them ....but.......... the verdict is still out"
4,Extremely uncomfortable at first- then extremely comfortable,"If you have worn soccer shoes before, it will not come as a surprise to you that they fit VERY snugly at first. I like to wear-in my soccer shoes slowly, so I wore them during school, and took them off right afterward. It took about a week for them to stretch out, but now they fit my feet perfectly."
4,Great!!!!!!!!,"These are some great shoes. Great touch, for me at least. They are extremely hard to break in though. Usually I can have a pair of soccer shoes broken in in about 2 days, but its gonna take awhile for these to break in. One thing that has helped me get them broken in quicker is using Chealsey Leather Conditioner on them for about 20 hours or so. Softens up the leather a bit. Still got another week before they are comfortable to wear for long though. Still excellent soccer shoes though.12/25/12 UpdateThese shoes are feeling sooo much better now. Still not quite broken all the way in yet, but they aren't hurting my feet after extended use any more, which is great. But they are starting to get comfortable."
5,Excellent... Samba!!!,"These are excellent choice for indoor soccer practice, the best I had so far and I have tried many recommended and they are casual also..."
5,I love these shoes,"I have these in both white and black. I originally bought them becasue the ""regular"" Samba's have an abnormally large tongue, and less heel support than the Millenium. All in all they are a great shoe. They take a few wears to break in, but after that they are incredibly confortable and durable. I am a soccer player, but I don't wear them to play indoor so I can't comment on their durability under game-speed stresses. I mostly wear them as a casual shoe and to knock the ball around when I am coaching, etc. As far as I'm concerned, I can't find anything wrong with this shoe. If you are looking at black/white Sambas, spend the extra $$$ and get the Millenium's. Cool, comfortable, durable, sporty."
3,If you really want to know...,"I have in the past known people who have ""claimed"" to be abducted by what they refer to as ""aliens"" or ""grays"", and experienced uncomfortable situations. But if you really have to know, you should learn what you can about secret societies, especially those involved with or the Illuminati themselves. You will find that the so-called alien structure is more spiritual and ""earthly"" than you realize and that mind control plays a very big part of it."
1,This book is not what it seems! Warning for parents.,"This book, and the corresponding website, is written by an atheist, and the website contains disturbing Lego ""creations"" by the author that young children should not be exposed to. How irresponsible for this author to use children to advance his agenda regarding his lack of belief in God."
1,Do not buy this book,"Please do not buy this book! The author, Brendan Powell Smith is a a self-proclaimed atheist and is mocking the Bible and Christianity. Thankfully Sam's Club pulled these books from it's shelves."
5,Check out his websites,You can see the contents of this book and the author's other work at [...]. Also check out the author's own website [...]. Very creative work however this is not geared towards children. There was a comment above about wrapping this with a box of legos for your child. Don't do that. Parents do your homework first!!!!
2,No real benefits...,"I have been using the Merc a month now and I've decided:It's a really good idea...the only problem is well, the design (the hardware), and the software. The gamepad is too spread out, its just as hard to reach all the keys as it is on a normal keyboard, it involves too much hand movement. I have big hands and I can't come close to reaching the top row of numbers comfortably. And as far as using it for regular typing when not gaming, you have to push num lock before you use any windows hotkeys...so it's not that great for gaming, and its awful for typing. Once you finally get the software set up just the way you want it, it randomly resets itself. Have yet to figure out why. It is decent for shooters, but not for MMORPGS (Warcraft), mainly due to it randomly changing key bindings and sometimes sluggish response. I honestly can't recomend this product, maybe with a few revisions."
5,"Awesome Board, OK Drivers","This board has worked perfect for me, not so much for the drivers. I did have the drivers installed and are working fine but they could be alot better, the drivers are memory intensive for some reason, and I wasnt able to change the hotkeys to the butterfly pad. This is still an awesome keyboard and I would recommend buying it, you can find updated drivers on there site, dont use the ones from the CD."
2,Not for Macs,Do not buy this product if you plan on using it for a mac. The computer will not recognize half the buttons. The drivers available are only written for pc. Sad.
3,Key board,"Bought for teen age boy 2 years ago, still working, but the number key board stopped working with in the first 3 months."
2,didn't work as expected,Although the mechanics of this keyboard are quite good for the money -- it has two main drawbacks -- the specialized gaming keys can be hard to adjust to manually -- and for me -- the reason I bought it was to implement keyboard macros in a game.I could never get this feature to work despite spending hours putzing around with it and following suggestions on the help site.I suspect this is a common problem from the suggestions posted there.I returned it -- the return policy was friendly and those wishing to give it a try probably should not be deterred by my experience.
3,Not Great,"If you don't mind figuring out your own steps, then you will like this. I know you can go back and watch it over and over again but when you watch it the first time, I would like to have time to process the steps. I don't care if it is advanced, you still need time to look at the step. Also, footwork would be nice.Mason has the lead do the steps first and it doesn't look like much until they dance together but you don't have time to see much."
5,Great DVD,My wife and I are taking Ballroom dancing lessons and use this DVD for a review when we are not in class.
5,buenos cables,"Estos cables son muy buenos, en construccion y entrega de sonido, e cambiado los cables de mis componentes y se siente mejor el sonido de mis discos, como asi tambien disfruto de las peliculas, muy satisfecho con la compra y llegaron en perfecto estado a santiago, chile"
3,Fair to middlin',"Fair value for the money. Decent construction. Was hoping for great sound at economy prices.Got OK sound. Suitable for casual listening, back up cables, or where you do not want to expose expensive cables to theft or damage.Replaced them with Monster cables, which improved the bass content and overall detail...........but for vastly larger amounts of money, of course."
5,Anolon Roasting Pan,This is a wonderful roasting pan. The ease if handling and cleanup make it a great alternative to flimsy aluminum disposable pans.
5,Novice? YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!,"Finally, one that WORKS! Set your home location & 24 hrs a day you can enter! Fast frwd clock & get a night view JUST AS YOU'LL SEE IT! Or, if you're into it you can switch to scope (inverted) view of ALL, just planets, satalites, galaxies, whatever, with or w/o local ground light, and ZOOM to view whatever from any object! I've just started, but it's the finest program I've got. Tossed Red Shift (et al), no contest! Sometimes I leave it on just to notice the sky darkening! Zoom, identify, shows moon in phases (and everything), it's all you could ask for!"
5,Good speaker,"Just bought one last night and quickly hook it up with my home audio system. I was immediately impressed with the sound coming out of this little box[...]You can't beat it...Movie dialog sound is tight, crisp, and vibrant...this is a definite must buy for the budget conscious home theatre novice...i have two Bostons for my fronts and a AudioSource subwoofer and a Pioneer VSX 100 watts/channel (5-channels) receiver...the[...] amazing KLH center channel speaker stands on its own..."
3,DID NOT COME WITH SPKR WIRE OR RUBBER FEET,But it sounds much better than my old one for only around $40. You decide.
1,Tech support ... no answer!,"I tried calling tech support, I am on-hold forever (all afternoon). I am giving up."
1,"Walk, Don't Run AWAY!","Briefly, we were very dissapppointed. Attempted both Broadband and Direct connection on phone line and both failed. We consider oursleves technical people too. That being said, we would have continued to try but NO TECH SUPPORT! On hold for 2 hours once, 1 1/2 hours the next, and an hour the next.....and never did get through. Same with another Sonic Blue product, which was mechanically defective, but due to lack of support we took both products back and are now enjoying the competition's products."
4,"Great product, some minor issues","Now that the 50XX series is out, the 55XX series is almost as good. The 5040 is/was a great deal since it was easily upgraded with cheap after rebate large drives. With the use of DVArchive, archiving/streaming/offloading movies is a snap even if you decide not to break the ""void if removed"" seal.The India Support is well documented as a minus. But once you've gotten past the initial problems, things seem to just run smoothly. The alternative are the forums on avsforums.c o m. They are regularly read by Replay employees who are responsive and helpful.Once working, this product will make you wonder what you did before it."
5,The Best,"I have both an old 2000 series and a 4000 series and if I could only keep on add on to my tv it would be replay tv. My 4000 series replay had some problems and the service staff at sonic blue were great. They had me send it back immediately and they shipped me a new one quickly. Try to get on with automatic commercial skip. It doesn't always work but most of the time it is great.They don't put it in the 5500 series, so it would be worth it to get a 4000 or 5000 series if you can."
2,What you should know about this unit,"I am disappointed with the unit. It has several glaring problems. The most notable is that the fan on the unit runs all the time. And it is not quiet. We have it in our bedroom and even inside an amoire with the doors closed I can hear it. It is really loud with the doors open. This is with the unit off and hard drive spun down! I fail to see the wisdom in this. Second, there is a USB 1.1 port specified on the specs on the web site. This is a lie. There is no USB port on the machine. There is a USB jack that is dead. Their excuse is that it is basically a future port. I wasted fifty bucks on a USB wireless adapter to connect the machine wirelessly to my home network. Finally, it is slower than my old Panasonic Showstopper 2000 at loading channels. Otherwise I am pleased with the features. But these are GLARING PROBLEMS. Be advised. Do your research"
4,Not Ready for Prime Time,"Well, I bought one of these for someone else, and after a lengthy install, got it to work as it should. Then I bought one for myself and it would not change channels on my satellite TV receiver, so I could not record anything except for the channel my satellite receiver was set to at the time. The tech support department (outsourced to India) took many hours of simple-minded guessing to finally tell me it was defective. If I had any experience with the product, I would have known much sooner that they had next to no idea what they were doing. I have rarely, if ever, experienced worse tech support. I ended up returning the item for a refund.If you can get yours to work, it is a great product. If you need to rely on Sonic Blue tech support, you should forget it and return the item unless your time is worth nothing and you have hours of it to waste."
1,Took it back!,"We had a terrible experience with this product and with Sonicblue's customer service. The player was hard to set up, never connected reliabily to the local number to download information, and finally simply stopped working. Customer service calls required long waits (45 minutes was the shortest -- when we called just as the customer service line opened -- 90 minutes for two other calls) and customer service personnel tried hard but couldn't offer definitive advice. We were finally told just to mail the unit back and get a new one. Instead, we returned RePlay and got TiVo -- set up in 15 minutes, flawless performance to date, and no need to call Customer service. We are still fighting with SonicBlue to get them to cancel our account so they don't keep charging us the monthly fee."
1,very disappointed with replay tv,"I recently bought this replay tv unit. I was very disappointed. When I was trying to set up the unit, it took very long. After trying various times, I finally got it set up, however, when i tried to watch tv, the screen kept freezing. I then called customer service, but could not get through. After trying for 4 days, i finally gave up and decided to return the unit. overall, this was a horrible experience. I will never purchase a replay tv unit again."
1,5 NEGATIVE stars! ReplayTV is the worse product ever!,"Not only was the unit defective, but it has been over 2 months since I contacted their ""knowledgeable"" tech support/customer service staff to get a replacement. Today, 02/27/03, they tell it will take another 5 to 7 business days to receive a replacement. That is what they said last week! I would never recommend this product! The people who claim it's GREAT are either very lucky or on the SonicBlue payroll! Don't be a fool, take my advice and don't throw your money away."
1,Don't waste your time on this.,"I tried and tried to call sales/support. They have over 5 difference 1-800 numbers but long-long-long-long waiting time. At the end, virtually no service/support. No one in North America will answer your call, they are all routed to South Asia. Paying $... service fee for this kind of service? You must be crazy."
1,buy tivo,"Have had the unit for 3 weeks. could not get the unit to connect to ""the replay system"". I was ready to ship unit back, and the unit finally connected. Now I tried to register for service. Called service activation line (they answer- they want money) 2 separate times, neither person was able to activate my system. Tried online activation, would not activate my account either. I still have my UPS return label, and will probably use it."
5,ReplayTV RTV5040 - easy & fun to use - a must,"For anyone that watches TV and either can't find anything to watch when they want, or hates commericals, this is a must have item. VCRs, they are just a thing of the past now. It really changes the way you watch TV. You just tell the ReplayTV unit to record what you want, then watch it when you want. It takes a couple minutes to setup, and it works with either a phone connection or an ethernet (for those with broadband access). It is loaded with other features, like commercial skip, photo viewer, and the like, and once you have one, you won't want to live without it."
5,RUN - Don't walk...,"I would suggest you add this product to your basket now. ReplayTV has changed the way I have watched TV for almost 3 years now. I purchased one of the original ReplayTV's from Amazon back in 1999 and have never, ever been sorry. Now with the addition of the 5000 series I couldn't be happier.The new 5000 series is generations ahead of TiVO. Broadband connectivity, Commercial Advance, myreplaytv.com, and an unmatched viewing experience are all innovations by ReplayTV and SonicBlue.I have found that the SonicBlue team has been very responsive to my calls and questions. Yes, there is some hold time, but no more than when you call your bank or cable company!I echo all positive reviews of this product and would NEVER be without one for as long as I watch TV! Don't settle for more expensive wanna-bes - purchase this product and I promise, you will never watch TV the same again!"
4,"very solid, and cheaper than tivo","pros:* I can program it via the web* Easy to use setup and interface, I didn't have to read any instructions to set up all my shows* cheaper monthly price than tivocons:* commerical advance doesn't work correctly on a lot of new shows, for instance in alias it randomly skips 4 to 5 minutes in the middle of the show. I normally just turn it off during these shows and use the quick-skip button. HOWEVER it works great for cartoons and the stuff I watch on the learning channel."
1,unuseable product/worst customer service,"We looked forward anxiously to set up and activate our Replay TV, but after hours of trying to reach customer support, and another hour and a half with support personel we are completely disillusioned with this product. The customer support is from a service center in India, the wait times to get to a support person are forever (1 hr plus), then the support is extremely uneven--some know the product, others are constanly having to check with someone or a manual to work through even basic issues. Channels are slow to change, our device is locked and only able to view one channel, no one can help remedy this. We're frustrated and furious to waste so much time and plan to return ASAP."
5,GREAT TIME SAVER!!!,Replay TV is the best time saver! I can watch a 60-minute prime time show in 40 minutes by skipping commercials! It's made it worth having premium cable channels since I can now plan on recording movies and shows I may miss if I'm not in the house! I heartily recommend it to ANYONE that wants to make the most out of their cable bill and their time!
1,Don't Buy this Product,"I purchasesd a 5040 Replay TV in December, 2002. The company's service is anyone's worst nightmare--on the line for hours to try to solve problems with an incompetent and ill trained service crew; at least once per week the connection to the update ""freezes"", which requires unplugging everything; you cannot contact the company except through their poorly trained staff at the 800 numbers. Do not respond faxes; email is only standard response with check boxes--if your problem does not fit a preconcieved idea of what a problems should be--forget it. Buying this product is asking for trouble--it is fitting that they went into bankruptcy."
1,Could not connect to server.,"The 5000 series I got, would not connect to the server. I keep getting a ""No answer"" message. After many attempts and long waits on hold (Two hours!), tech support was not able to resolve the problem. The Web site did have directions for getting a new list of phone numbers. However, the Replay OS was not compatible with the Web sites directions. I ended up returning the unit. Amazon made this easy. Thank you Amazon."
1,Hangs and denied Rebate,"The unit hangs every other night on downloading data from the telephone, the unit doesn't get some channels, they say the signal strength is too low and they denied my rebate claim saying I didn't send in the UPC code, which I am 99+% sure I did, especially since it is missing from my box. Buy the TIVO."
5,Huge impact in my life,I purchase replay tv and it is probably the first time in a long time that I was completely satisfied with a electronic product. All the features I could ever ask for. I would definitley recommend.
2,I am unimpressed,"We have digital cable hooked up using coax between all the components so I hooked up the DVR using composite cables. That way I could compare the 2 paths. I am really disappointed in the quality and performance and will probably return it. The problems are:1) Noticeable degradation in image quality. I understand that when using the replaytv I am actually looking at a recorded signal but I thought the whole idea was that there would be so little degradation it wouldn't be noticeable. When viewed via the DVR, the images are quite fuzzy and everyone I've shown imediately notices.2) The system is REALLY slow to change channels3) It hangs periodically. I set it up to record from the VCR and when I tried to stop it, the system hung so I had to unplug it.4) It takes forever to boot. I suppose this is one component you aren't supposed to turn off but even my old 8088 based IBM PC's booted faster than this.Overall, I am completely unimpressed"
1,Service charge not fully disclosed or seemed fair...,"We bought this digital video recorder in order to save the images from an outdoor surveillance camera. We didn't need to route it through a tv, but could send the image right to the recorder. So, we thought that there shouldn't be any problem with this. However, after we tried to set up the machine, we found out that NO MATTER how it was being used (for recording tv shows or CCTV), the monthly charge had to be paid. This didn't seem fair or economical. We called the company and got a whole lotta people who didn't seem to know much about how the recorder worked or in this case didn't work without being hooked up to a tv. We returned it."
1,Should've gone Tivo,"...the first time. Very, very happy with my Tivo. The Tivo functionality, ease of use & tech support have all been great."
2,Cosmetic Damage,"The TV was shipped quick and the packaging was in good condition. Unfortunately, there was a noticeable defect in the cabinet just below the screen. I contacted the manufacturer and was told cosmetics are not covered by the warrranty."
4,Good wire bad connectors,"I bought this wire a year ago for around 30 bucks for 25 ft. pair X4 and that was a steal. It is as good or better than the monster wire XP that it replaced and I needed the longer lengths to run to my rears. My only complaint is with the plugs they are cheap brass plugs, but if you replace them with higher quility plugs you got yourself a real winner."
1,These bars are too expensive for how tiny they are.,"Length:: 0:13 MinsSince I can't attach a photo to my review, I decided to take a video of my 8 year old son opening one of these bars so you can see first hand how small they are in comparison to a small boy's hands.I purchased these for my son who has celiac disease. We were incredibly disappointed on the packaging and size of these bars. Based on the size of the box and the picture on the front, we expected full size bars - not a tiny gummy square. Most of the packaging is air.My son does like the taste of these however. The packaging just seems misleading and they seem to be way too expensive for what they are."
1,The new bars are awful!,"My kids loved the cocoa loco bars - until I opened our newest shipment and found that the bars had completely changed! They are completely different and they are awful. My kids generally love anything chocolate, but they threw these in the garbage after one bite. They described them as tasting like rubber. I ate one and fully agreed. There goes the one gluten free snack bar that my kids actually liked!"
1,HORRIBLE,"These are the WORST BROWNIES EVER CREATED. I've been gluten free for about a year and a half, and really miss ""real"" brownies. These brownies are like eating chalk, which proceeds to dry out your mouth like no other. They are so bad I tricked my football playing 20 year old brother (who eats anything) into taking a bite and he had to spit it out. Yeah- do NOT BUY them. Seriously- horrible... Unless you are doing fear factor, or have a cruel sense of humor. I would not recommend waisting your money."
1,Completely inedible!,"Completely inedible. Tastes like cardboard. Zero flavor. Also, everyone is right about the bar being half the size of the packaging. The wrapper for the bar is way too big for what they give you. Save your money!"
1,Totally Gross!,"These are totally inedible. I could not believe how disgusting they tasted. I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased these. Now I guess they will have to go to some unlucky trick-or-treaters, otherwise I don't know what I would do with them. They have no flavor whatsoever. ICK!"
5,"Taste great, size is right too.","These bars taste really good. I don't know what the front page reviews on Amazon are showing, the sizes on the box are right."
1,Truly Terrible,"I never tried these when they were good before the recipe change, according to the other reviews, and I don't normally eat grains (my version of gluten free is an SCD/grain free diet), but when my son, who is gluten free, told me how horrible these were, I was in disbelief, (he loves Schar cookies, anything by UDI's, etc....) To see for myself, I took one bite of these cocoa Loco bars, and after chewing a few moments, had to spit my bite out in the sink, which is highly unusual for me as I can stomach a diverse variety of foods more sensitive palates may not enjoy. I cannot believe they market this as food for human consumption. It is beyond utterly and completely gross in texture, and in taste. What a shame they sell these as they are. This is the one time I would give a product less than one star, if I could.How in the world did these ever pass a taste test panel? What was the company thinking?"
4,Pretty good,"For a gluten free product, these are pretty good. I like getting a taste of chocolate with what seems to be a modest amount of sugar. They do not have the luxurious texture of chocolate candy, but if I wanted candy, I would buy candy."
1,False advertisement? Don't buy these.,"I used to get these and kept wondering what other posters keep complaining about! Now I know. This time I bought 2 packs and I was in it for a surprise. The single portions are 1/3 of the size of what they used to be. The box hasn't changed! It lookes as big as before. So when you open it, it's mostly air! The box is empty except for 5 small pieces barely bigger than mini hershey bars. I will try to return these. I used to like this product but I hate it when companies start to rip off their clients. That's the end of me buying this stuff and in fact the end of me buying anything from this company Enjoy Life from now on."
1,Do Not Want!,"I recently tried these because I love the chocolate cookies they make. I was expecting them to be just as good if not better, but boy was i wrong... First of all these things are disgusting! They're thick, dry, and totally bland. Not to mention the fact that their about an inch and a half. Looking at the box they appear to be ATLEAST double that size. I ate one by itself and was extremely surprised, so giving them the benefit of the doubt I tried it with some ice cream. it was about .1% better.Bottom line, these things were not worth the money. So many other great snacks out there that taste way better!"
1,No reason to buy it!,All the negative reviews in here are just to be kind. There are no words sufficient to describe how terrible this product is. I felt scratchy in my throat after eating just half of the bar.
1,Not Good,"I ordered these for my daughter who was having to change to a no milk, no soy, no yeast, extremely low carb diet and was really missing her sweet treats. She has eaten about 3 bars and enjoyed them. However, every one since then has been moldy when opened. She is frustrated and I am not happy about spending money on a product that seems to get moldy easily, even when stored in a dry, dark climate."
2,Cardboard much?,"While they did not trigger my IBS, this product is VERY dense and kinda tasteless. Not a satisfying substitute for chocolate."
2,Old recipe please!,"I recently purchased a box of the OLD recipe cocoa loco bars and really liked them. They looked a bit unappetizing but tasted great and had a good texture. Went back to the store today and all they had were these, the new formula bars. The new ones look better but the taste is way off and they are gummy in texture whereas the old ones were more cake-like. Very disappointing. I'll try one more and see if it grows on me, but I'm pretty sure I'll end up tossing the rest of the box."
1,"Moldy, Awful, Terrible, Dreadful, and 100% preservative free!","If I could give a product minus twelve stars this one would get it. We bought six boxes of these only to open sealed packets and find the product covered with a hairy white mold. Of course it was all natural, non-GMO, preservative free, gluten-free mold!There is a very good scientific and rational reason why competent food makers use preservatives, and that is to preserve the food. Here we see the benefit of an irrational and ignorance based prejudice against the use of preservatives - the woo woo friendly preservative free all natural food goes bad precisely because it has no preservatives.I called the manufacturer and the best they could offer was an apology, which was obviously sincere, and some coupons good for future purchases. Fat lot of good a handful of coupons will do me when I am never buying these again while shopping online.RUN AWAY!"
2,Yuck!,"If you like dry, thick, distasteful calories then this could be your new solution. The cardboard package is pobably more tasteful than the actually chewys.But if you ""have to try them"", be humble and come back and rate my rating as helpful as you realize I was right. :)Hope this was helpful!"
1,My kid does not like it,"I bought this for my 4 yrs old, and he does not like it. I also tried it, and it is actually really Bad"
5,I typically enjoy using shower gels because they ...,I typically enjoy using shower gels because they rinse so much better than bar soaps. I have very sensitive skin and bar soap generally dries out my skin very badly. This soap actually rinsed very clean without any sticky residue. I didn't have a problem with dry skin and the fragrance was refreshing. I think I found myself a new soap! I would definitely recommend this soap.
4,I totally loved this product. It smells so ...,"I totally loved this product. It smells so fresh. I had that just-out-of-the-shower feeling all day. I didn't feel itchy after using it, like I do with others. I would recommend this product to a friend or family member because it's a great product and it really works! I will never go back to those expensive bath bars again!!!!"
3,A different Joan of Arc,"This is Joan of Arc but so different from their other albums. I really enjoyed the first four albums especially the middle three as for this, this is very different. Tim is singing more in tune, he's creating melodies, his lyrics make more sense, the album is actually structures into songs. . .in otherwords, it's all wrong. If you never liked Joan of Arc to begin with you'll like this, if you've liked Joan of Arc a lot this'll be somewhat of a dissapointment, get In Rape Fantasy & Terror Sex We Trust instead."
1,title of review,"I don't understand why anyone would like this album. In fact I'd wonder if the Joan Of Arc fans who like this record ever really appreciated their other albums at all. All their other albums were great, The Gap less so, but the first three were full of excellent melodic interesting music. This new album is so bland, dull, dead, uninteresting and worthless. You might as well listen to an Oasis album."
3,DanceCulture - Ups and Downs,"I bought this CD because of the reviews that I have read on Amazon.com's site. I've heard ""bumpin'"", ""jumpin'"", and many other adjectives to describe this CD; however, with only 13 tracks--and one track comes in at a whopping 29 seconds plus there is no ENERGY until Madonna's song--I needed to hear much more ""bumpin'"" so I could keep ""jumpin'"". The Madonna cut is the best by far of the tracks listed. I enjoyed ""Alone"" and ""You Used to Hold Me"" as well. Most of the other tracks are pretty non-descript, if you ask me. If this is high N-R-G music, someone please explain ""Let the Rhythm"" as I found it pretty boring.I expect dance music to be just that: danceable, and I don't want to have to continue to push the ""next"" button on the CD to find a track that is. The remix of Madonna's song makes this CD. If it were not for that one, I'd have been very disappointed."
4,A Masterpiece!,"Tracy Young has OUTDONE herself with this compilation of fantastic, spine-tingling and thumping dance music. This mix of tracks has something for every taste, including vocal dance remixes, deep house, and industrial dance. Remixes of Chaka Khan, Suzanne Palmner and Cyundi Lauper are some of the best I have heard in years, and tracks like ""The Beats and The Drums"", ""The Bass Drive"" and the mix of Ralphi Rosasrio's ""You Used to Hold Me"" make this one of the strongest dance compilations since Junior Vasquez' ""Twilo"" collection. But it is with Madonna's ""Easy Ride"" That Tracy Young truly shines, the song is so shiver inspiring that I had to actually pull my car to the side when the track hit its climax. In summary, Danceculture is one of the finest vocal house/dance music commercial releases, that I have come upon, in a very long time."
3,helps,"If you are looking for an answer to pain relief, here it is. It helps a lot and I am so glad I purchased this book. All the exercises are easy and require nothing more than things you already have a chair, the floor, and a mat in many cases."
3,"Interesting read, but did not work for me",Had this recommended to keep me busy when laying in bed due to sickness.Its an interesting read and Moshe's life and history is interesting and encouraging in itself - but the whole concept does not really work for me. I tried some of the 'exercises' and it keeps you busy and your mind off for a while - but as a philosophy it does not work for me. And it did not really 'improve' my health or my perception of it.Not my cup of tea.
3,Wacquant Psycho-analytic Portrait,"Put simply: if you want to get a decent look at the inner-city boxing phenomenon, buy this. But if you are in academia, be warned: Wacquant is far from the detached observer he swears he is. A good example of what NOT to do in ethnographic research."
1,"Wow, what a bad book","I wish I had known that this book was previously published in 1979 under a different title. Maybe that explains why it is so bad - James Patterson has obviously honed his skills as a writer in the last 20 years! I really think his books are great otherwise (although I haven't read Pop Goes the Weasel yet).This book has a good premise, I think, a subject a lot of people would enjoy reading. But it is so confusing and slow and scattered and BORING! I always finish a book I start (even the slow ones), but 128 pages into it and I could not force my self to finish it! Very disappointing work from an excellent writer of thrillers."
2,I thought I would ignore the reviews on here...,"too bad I didn't. If you want to start out reading James Patterson, this would be a bad place to start. It's nice too read to see how Mr. Patterson has come as a writer. The story is unreal and crazy, in a really bad way. He does do a good job of describing everything to you, but that's about it.Ugh!There are some funny parts though, like when he spends 2 pages describing the setting, so that they characters can say two lines....I repeat, DO NOT BASE YOUR OPINION ON JAMES PATTERSON WITH THIS BOOK."
2,RUNNING DOWNHILL,"James, you should be ashamed. Granted, the Holocaust is a horrible, horrible part of this world's history, and my heart goes out to anyone who was subjected to this heinous persecution. But in this book, Patterson expects the reader to sympathize with a group of Jews who want revenge, and don't stop at anything to get it. This is not a case of ""an eye for an eye""; it is really a literary ploy to churn out this pedestrian novel. There are so many plot inconsistencies and shallow characterizations. How can the hero David Strauss fall in love again with Alix so quickly after his wife's murder? And how in the world can we expect this doctor (a gynecologist) to become such a super hero by the end of the book. I love James Patterson's works, but this is sadly rock bottom.NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,Boring and Flat,"I like James Patterson's later novels, but I think he made a mistake by re-issuing some of his earlier books under new titles. SEE HOW THEY RUN, which was Patterson's third book, was originally titled the JERICHO COMMANDMENT and was originally published in the late 1970s. This plot deals with a terrorist plot involving the Olympics -- I won't say more than that, because it would spoil certain twists in the plotline (many of the reader reviews do exactly that, so be wary of reading them!).Unfortunately, SEE HOW THEY RUN has really thin characterization and a meandering plot that doesn't really excite or satisfy the reader. I also wasn't thrilled to see the Holocaust used as a cheap plot device, which is essentially what this book boils down to.Patterson, like most writers, got better with time. My advice is to skip this early effort and focus your attention on the Alex Cross series and Women's Murder Club series, which are far superior to this misfire."
1,Lots of words and not much story,"I was very excited when I saw the book and when I read it I was very disappointed. It was very confusing, a great example of this was Hitler having lunch in Washington D.C. several decades after the war. More Alex Cross, please!"
1,I am so disappointed James...,"I cannot believe that this is the James Patterson that writes all of my favourite books - Along Came A Spider, Kiss The Girls, Cat and Mouse etc.. This has got to be the 2nd JP book that I have hated so much that I had to put it down halfway through, I never ever ever do that to JP!Although I was looking forward to reading about the Jews, Nazis, Hilter, this book was so unbelievably boring that I did not care about what was going to happen to Alix or any of the silly characters.I did not know that this was written in the 70's, before his success with Alex Cross, if I had known that, I would never have bothered to pick it up.Please, if you are looking for the suspense-filled, action packed, twists and turns at every moment, usual JP books, this do yourself a favour and DO NOT READ THIS ONE!Thank goodness for Alex Cross!"
2,Not bad for one of his first books.,"This is book was originally the Jericho Commandment which was one of the first books he wrote in 1979. The information in this book is all fiction. You will get dissapointed in James Patterson after reading 'See How They Run"" if you read Jack and Jill before."
1,"Sorry, Jim......HATED IT.","James Patterson has a problem: his books are either really good, or really, really bad. See How They Run is the second one. (Some books that are really good by him are Kiss The Girls, Along Came A Spider, Hide and Seek, Jack and Jill....I think thats it.) I'm not exactly sure why I didn't like this book, I guess it was because it was really STUPID. It didn't entertain me at all. James Patterson is a really good author (sometimes) and if you would like to read some of his books, I recommend the ones I said earlier."
2,*sigh* what is going on?,"I love Patterson; however, this book is so full of inconsistencies, false ""facts"", missing links, crazy mysteries and unfinished story lines, that I simply cannot recommend it to anyone. While, the general idea for this book's plot may be interesting (even though apparently it's highly controversial to some people), the author made it boring, flat, and not believable at all.At times it almost seems as if Patterson were writing 3 or more books at once and he went back and forth between them whilst forgetting which one he is writing at the moment.In my opinion the worst thing about this book is not the plot, not even all the things that made no sense, but the absolute lack of depth of the characters. These people seem absolutely unreal, which bothers me to no end."
3,Liked His other Books Better,"I've read Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls, so I was expecting more and I got less. I saw on the inside cover the original copyright was 1979. The rhytmn is that of an earlier writer before he developed his style. The text is very flat and the characters are not well developed. It reads too much like a TV plot. The topic however is interesting about terriost and Patterson does mange to through in a twist here and there to keep the story interesting. In the end, his later books are better"
1,Distasteful Story,"With due credit to James Patterson, this is only the second of his books that I have read with the first being The Jester. Everyone I know who reads James Patterson, raves about his writing so I've got to give this guy another chance as See How They Run is one of the worst books I've read. Actually, only a third of the way through, I was so bored and disgusted with the plot and charactors that I skimmed to the end just to see if the so-called incredible ending was as I had figured out early on. The charactors were unbelievable, the plot development uneven and the actual story was, in my opinion, in very bad taste."
1,HORRIBLE,"this james patterson book sucked horribly! my stupid friend read it and thought it was good, but it wasn't. its a about some angry Jews who will stop at nothing for revenge.... not exactly a good story. ugh i can't beleive she read this horrible peice of trash, jenny, i feel sorry for you"
1,horrible,"man this book was horrible with a capital H. my friend,jenny, read this book about angry jews who will stop at nothing for revenge, and she thought it was good, it sucked, stupid zealots giving it good reviews, ugh"
2,disappointing,I just started reading this book. it is very hard to follow. Not typical of James Patterson books. Very dissapointed in this particular reading.
2,Disappointed,I loved every James Patterson book I read until this one. The book was slow and boring. It was too heavy in history and not any entertainment.
2,Not bad for his 3rd book,"""See How They Run"" aka ""The Jericho Commandment"" is not bad for James Patterson's 3rd book. I found it an easier read that his first two: ""Season of the Machete"" and ""The Thomas Berryman Number"".I was able to see his well-known style of writing suspense developing from his first two projects and that kept me interested in spite of the number of characters and foreign words. I found I was ""on the edge of my seat"" at some points of this book, however I was slightly disappointed with the ending.I agree with some of the other reviews posted here, but please keep in mind this is one of JP's earlier works. I will continue to read and enjoy all of his works, and I hope you do the same!"
1,The editor should be fired,"Patterson's books run the gamut...some great and then this lousy one. I couldn't get into the story because of the terrible factual errors that jarred i.e. Dachau was a concentration camp NOT a death camp (executions yes, ovens yes but no gas chambers). Big difference. Final straw: 1st graf in Chapter 53, on a Russian train are ""portraits of Nikolai Lenin and Karl Marx..."" Nikolai??? Nikolai??? Its Vladimir Ilich Lenin dummy. Amazing he didn't also say ""and Groucho Marx."" I blame the editor for not catching this stuff."
3,good basket; large holes,"I like this basket fairly well, however the holes in it are very large, so I cannot add the straws in with the lids of the sippy cups. They just fall right out. I ended up buying the sippy cup straw cleaning brushes by OXO and they work great. I would have loved if I could have gotten a basket where all the parts were secured well enough to go through the dishwasher"
2,Similar unit from Munchkin is much better,"While this container holds nipples in place nicely and the basket is good for the standard infant goodies, the unit made by Munchkin I always use first. The lower portion of the basket is awkward to open, and the placement of caps above the nipples means leftover water always gets dumped on the nipples. Flipping the unit upside down does help both these issues, but then the nipples don't drain the right way."
1,"cheap plastic, hard to open lid",Made from real cheap plastic. The lid is kind of hard (inconvenient) to open. Overpriced as well. Not worth more than $5 I think.
4,What I've been searching for,"I looked for this concept at about 5 stores, in vain. This is terrific! Pretty sturdy. Large capacity. Fits great in the upper rack."
2,Not a fan,"I don't like how sharp the edges on the plastic are. It makes for a less than pleasant experience while putting bottles in the device. I've had it for a few weeks and have only used it once. I prefer to just hand wash our bottles, pacifiers, accessories, and breast pump parts. It's a good idea but ehh, not a hit."
2,how awful,"I have read both The Sight and Firebringer 3 different times. Due to them, David Clement-Davies has become my favorite author. After waiting 2 years for him to write another book, he came out with this one. I was very eager to read it. I ordered it, and read it right when it came in. The book however simply was awful. It had all the makings of a typical childish novel. Gone were the mature ideas found in his other 2 novels. Gone also was the book about a society of animals. Perhaps the only likeness this book had to the other 2, other than having the same author, was the inclusion of a prophecy. Even this wasn't really stuck to. Overall, I found this book to be a major disapointment."
4,I thought that Neutrogena soap was a very ...,"I thought that Neutrogena soap was a very good product. It really did help clear up my skin, although it was a bit drying. If you have very dry skin, I wouldn't recommend using this. However, if you have combination or oily skin, this product will be great for clearing up any unwanted acne."
4,The Adventures of Ma & Pa Kettle - Volume 1,"I really enjoyed this DVD. These old black & white movies had to depend upon the story and the actors, not special effects. This DVD is very good; however, the movies are not arranged in the order that they were released. All in all, I would buy more Ma & Pa Kettle movies, if they make more DVD's."
4,Why The Disc Flipping?,"It's great to have Ma & Pa on DVD, but can anyone explain why Universal put them on the discs out of order??? Side one contains Egg and I and Go To Town, although Go To Town was the third in the series. Anyone who happens to watch them in the order that they are on the DVD will become slightly confused. Here is the correct order:Egg and I- Side OneFurther Adventures- Side TwoGo To Town- Side OneBack On The Farm- Side TwoHope that helps!"
2,not complete,I gave this dvd as a gift to my mother. I knew she would enjoy it but she told me all the movies did not come with it. This was a great disappoinment to me.
2,Old Time Fun,"This was a hilarious movie. Every since I heard the title Ma @Pa Kettle I have wanted to see them.... I wasn't as good as I thought, but I would recommend it to old schooler who love good clean fun..."
3,The Adventures Of Ma & Pa Kettle - Volume 1,"Not as good as I had expected, but still brought back memories of the family at the Theater before we had a TV."
4,Regular Guy,"Old, old movie but timeless in its comedy. I have always wanted to be like Pa Kettle who has never worked a day in his life. You will roll off of the couch laughing as you watch this old flick..."
5,Ma & Pa Kettle Vol. 1,Product was as discribed. Fair price and it arrived in good time and in good shape. Very satisfied.
5,Ma & Pa Kettle - Vol 1,What a joy to return to a simpler time. Wonderful for children of any age - sure to stir lots of questions from the younger set - if you can just get them to sit still long enough to get started. Highly recommend it.
5,Love it!!!,I love it! It's so funny. I have been watch it with my dad since I was teenager and finally got this for my own.
2,Ma and Pa Kettle,was not happy with this DVD as this item was scratch when l got it it playes for about 15 minutes then stop then we would have to fast forward a little to get it going again
2,Buyer Beware,"Buyer beware.These four movies are contained on one two-sided disc, even though it is deceptively packaged to look like a box set.The only three-star movie of the four is ""The Egg and I."" It stars Claudette Colbert and Fred Macmurray and is the film that introduced the Kettles. The film quality on the DVD is average -- the blacks appear very scratchy -- and it has obviously not been remastered or restored in any way.Most important is the fact that the DVD ""skips"". Whether I got a bad DVD or whether this is a result of cramming four movies onto one disc, I don't know, but my DVD player had trouble reading the disc."
5,"Ma & Pa Kettle, Vol. 1",We LOVE Ma & Pa Kettle movies. They are so funny and they're clean. No cussing or sexual inuendos or violence and that is refreshing!
3,"Inconsistent Movies, Bad DVD Case","I still have fondness for the Kettle clan from my childhood, but some of the later movies did not hold up well for me. But my major objection to this set is the bad dvd case, as well as the abhorred double-sided discs which I have read are typically of inferior quality, and more vulnerable to handling. DVD's are not supposed to be flexed due to potential damage to the micro-metal film inside. The inflexible spindle holds on to the discs so tightly that I would have had to flex the discs way too much just to pry them off. I actually had to break the spindle apart in order to release the discs, then replace the case with a decent replacement."
3,non-working DVD,This DVD doesn't play on my player. The sound jumps around so that I can't understand a word they say.
5,great movies,You just can't find good movies like this anymore.My kids love to seat with me and watch the movies.it can't get any better then this.thank you
1,Give this DVD a Miss!,"Quality of print is good but because DVD is double sided with poor build quality, Your player will ""pause"" every few seconds for a couple of seconds. During the ""pause"" information is not shown vertually making the movie unwatchable. This product should not be sold."
5,The perfect reunion.,"Pierre Fournier sings better that all that sings and Friedrich Gulda's playing on a Bosendorfer piano is never harsh and overwhelming the cello. What might have been a strange reunion between the classical French tradition of cello and the modern school of piano is still a must, fifty years later."
4,Audio Coax (orange RCA) replacement,Audio output seems to have improved with this cable replacement.
2,Misleading title photo and description,"The quality of this cable is fine but the product photo might lead you to believe that this is a stereo RCA cable. It is a MONO cable, but nowhere is this noted in the description of the product (at least when I purchased it). 2 stars only because the cable is of decent quality, 5 stars if the description and picture weren't misleading."
2,Only problem.....,This is a single chord. I isnt theleft and right RCA. I purchased this but never used it bc I dont have anything mono that uses RCA.
3,What he said,"THIS IS A MONO AUDIO CABLE. High quality, but I assumed it was a stereo cable without reading. Just ordered a second one to fill my needs though."
2,Wilton Race Car pan,"Amazon did a great job of sending the pan to me. It arrived in 48 hours. However, the product itself could have been better. After the cake was turned out of the pan, the indentations of the race car design all but disappear. It made is extremely hard to recreate the design."
4,Great Electronic Breakz CD A little on the repetitive side,"From the first track to the last you'll be bustin' a groove to these Electro-Sample Breakz. Trax from artists all over the globe. I liked this cd not only because of the up-beat soulful trax, but also because you can't go wrong with DJ ICEY, THURSDAY CLUB, MIDFIELD GENERAL, and so many more artists. It was a little repetitive on some trax . To sum it up, this cd is ... Very Eklectic, Very Electric, So Hippin' you'll be Trippin' ( # )( # ) -r0bB"
5,Great Surround Sound for those on a budget!,"I own a set of very powerful Cambridge Soundworks speakers, hooked up to my DVD player they sound awesome. However they are always in need of repairs, and I was expecting the overall price to be what I paid $1200 for the set. But now I've just about doubled that from repairs. While these speakers aren't as reliable they do sound better then alot of surround sound speakers and these have yet to need repairs, when they are acctually placed in a worse area. So if you need good speakers cheap, these are them."

5,Great quality,"The length (3 feet) is great for running my mp3 adatper to my car stereo aux in. Very high quality, but you lose some flexibility by this so turning a tight corner is not advisable. I wanted the highest quality I could find in a short cable, and this fit the bill at a great price. Again, the only thing I would point out is this thing is stiff like coaxial cable."
4,Great deal,Very sturdy case. I have it loaded down and have never had a page tear and the cover shows no sign of the abuse it has gone through. I wish I could find more pages to add but that might be pushing it.
1,These comedians need therapists ................,"I bought it cheap, and I can see why. This is the unfunniest comedy series ever made. There are some laughs, but the tiny budget it was made on shows in everything. I've never fallen asleep watching a comedy before, but it happened a few times with this one.I'm sure there is a minority audience with a strange sense of humor that would enjoy it, but something so amateur could never make it to prime time network TV. The second season is just as bad."
4,IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!,"Thank you, comedy central! You would've got 5 stars, but given that Season 1 is only 6 eps, it would have been better to combine Seasons 1 & 2 in one (less expensive, overall) volume. But I'm still doin a snoopy dance--Dr. Katz was my second all-time favorite Comedy Central show & I've been waiting to upgrade my worn-out Dr. Katz VHS for AGES! Now where's the rest of it? and where's the rest of Upright Citizen's Brigade?! get on it!"
1,Disappointing,"This book was a huge disappointment to me . I was expecting more since Asimov's name is printed on the cover . This book is for kids ,not for adults . Be careful !"
2,"Not particularly useful, incorrect date","The amazon search summary shows this article has having been written in 2006. It actually appeared in the November 22, 2004 edition of Modern Brewery Age.Rather than being a report in its own right, it is simply a brief summary of a Merrill Lynch report."
4,Love them Belgians--HD600s for $177,"...I've had em for a day. Running a NAD C540 Cd-player, NAD C370 amplifier, with MIT terminator 2 interconnects. So far so good. The sound is a touch on the bright side, and particularly so with already bright recordings. This I hope will abate with sufficient burn-in time. Already the reproduction of voice and acoustic material is excellent in terms of clarity, and is convincingly natural. Some electronic and rock (police/masive attack) sound a little harsh in addition to the brightness. I'm betting that harshness will disappear soon.Sound field on these has occassionally been staggering. Listen to Pink Floyd the wall another brick pt 2 about 3 mins 30s in--the kids in the play ground sound like they're about a foot outside your head!My B&W; 2000 speakers have better clarity, detail, and obviously sound staging. . . but I need to crank em to ear bleeding levels for that. . .hence the phones.(..."
5,The gold standard for a reason,"I bought these 6 years ago and still enjoy them everyday.The neutral sound signature and comfort makes listening to music or movies for long periods of time extremely easy. Every part of the frequency spectrum sounds fantastic. The sound stage is unbelievable.I could see how some people might find these sort of 'boring' sounding, but that's just the nature of a highly accurate headphone.The only knock against this is that the cable gave out on mine, probably from rolling over it one too many times in my office chair (it lasted a couple of years). Fortunately the cable is easily replaceable, and I swapped the original for an hd650 cable, which is much more robust. I've had no problems since.Yes, an amp is often recommended for these, but I use it unamped quite often (although I have an amp), and it still sounds great."
1,Did I get a bad sample? Totally disappointed!,"Yes, I burned them in for at least 25 hours. They sounded muddy. Smooth as caramel, but veiled. The bass was heavy and indistinct. The high frequencies were not clean, and not abundant.Having listened to Stax headphones for years and years, I know I got used to a superclean, almost clinical sound. But still I cannot believe how completely different the HD600s were.I borrowed these from a friend, who bought them new and had hardly used them. Frankly, I get more pleasure listening with my Sony MDR-W20G sports headphones that I bought for less than $10. I am at a loss to understand the glowing reviews. I would love to hear a headphone that sounds as wonderful as people are describing. But the one I heard did not. Not even after break-in. Never would I consider one of these phones without auditioning them. Perhaps I truly heard a rare, defective unit. But if so, both drivers were defective, because they sounded the same."
2,Warning: Don't Buy These Headphones!!,"Headphones are supposed to let you enjoy music without disturbing other people around you.These headphones leak so much sound that I can't listen to music in bed without waking my wife.Also, because they leak so much sound, they create feedback in the recording studio. My nephew tried them and says the volume is much weaker than his Sony phones..."
5,I am in love with my Sennheiser HD600 headphones!,"I bought my Sennheiser HD600 headphones about 3 months ago. I broke them in with about 50 hours of jazz music after which they sound amazing!Realize that you need a headphone amp for these headphones. I refused to pay $500+ for a headphone amp and it took me a lot of time to find a good, low-cost amp. I finally found an excellent amp in the Samson S-Monitor. They cost just $60 and they offer clean, undistorted output. You can easily spend $500 on a headphone amp but I somehow doubt it'll sound better than the Samson S-Monitor - Sennheiser HD600 headphone combo.In my opinion, this is the poor man's alternative for $20.000+ high-end static speakers! What you read in the other positive reviews about the Sennheiser HD600 is true, if you have good ears you should definitely get these headphones. Unless you don't like headphones and can afford high-end static speakers of course."

5,Great advice for the small and medium sized retailer,"This is a quick read, but contains a lot of great advice. It is oriented toward the smaller mom-and-pop retailers who have to compete with the big-box stores. However, even a retailer such as the one I work for with hundreds of stores can get a lot out of Phibbs' ideas. This book has many great concepts that center around employee training and customers relations."
3,need more info to help me want to buy than THIS is GREAT!,"if you own this model please tell me , does it really have a s-video imput and a front A/V in front and another in the back? I am looking for a tv that has 2 a/v's and 1 s-video, I need them for my toshiba dual dvd player, playstation 2(yes I have one) and dreamcast."
4,Good Product,"I only gave this 4 stars because, though it says on the Zoe website that this is a good high pressure shower head, it actually is not as strong as we would have liked. My husband and I bought it so neither of us would be cold when showering together. Though it has worked relatively well, the water pressure could be stronger. I have to say though, the pressure at our house has never been particularly strong. SO if you have good pressure you will probably like it.I do really enjoy the rain setting. My husband prefers the traditional shower head because he doesn't like the water coming straight down, like a rain-style head does. So I am glad we went with this model and not some of the other double-headed models that only have one style of head."
1,WAAAY OVERPRICED!,I didn't do enough homework before buying this. Home Depot and Lowes have very similar products for almost half the price and some products that look and work better in my opinion (like having a bar which attaches to the wall for the movable head so you adjust the height). I wish I could take it down (my plumber installed it) and return it. I would not recommend this considering other products for less money.
2,Don't let the photo fool you - it's a bag - not a box.,"It is not a 'box' -- it is a zippered 'box-shaped' bag made out of very thin canvas fabric, that is lightweight and pliable. It is not made of the heavy duty canvas you'd find in say an LL Bean tote bag therefore without an additional metal frame, it has no shape of it's own. So the picture is a bit misleading - this canvas zippered fabric bag would only look like the box in the photo if it was holding a rectangular box that exact same size.When half full it collapses on itself and when full of items looks lumpy. I would love to find a canvas box with a frame that would hold it's shape, but having looked all over, this is all I could find. Other than that, it's fine for what it is, zippers worked, handles were sewn on well, held up when it was full, etc."
5,canvas storage boxes,"These storage boxes are wonderful! They're much larger than I thought and hold a ton of stuff! Great for clothes and bulky items since they have a lot of give to them. And since they allow the items to breathe no worries about mildew. I've used Space Bags, plastic totes and cardboard storage-I like these the best! Shipping was fast and well done."
5,Great Idea,I too have been looking for something to store extra bedding - Thanks for pointing that out!!!
3,This cleansing soap was very refreshing. It was ...,"This cleansing soap was very refreshing. It was not a heavy soap that made you feel like your pores were clogged for the rest of the day. It also left my dry-in-the-winter-time legs nice and soft. I could tell that it did moisturize a bit. I gave it only a 3 for an overall rating because the fragrance is fruity and overpowering. Despite the fact that I liked what the soap did, I didn't enjoy the flowery scent that lingered."
3,For me this body wash seemed just like ...,"For me this body wash seemed just like any other body wash, if not a little worse. The formula was for dry skin. I have very dry skin in the winter and this wash did nothing for that, just seemed to make it worse. After using it, my skin would feel tight and even drier. I must say though it does smell really nicely and lathers up like it should. I do however think that they could change the top so you can just leave it open and turned upside down like you can with most body washes. It would be impossible to do that with this one. I say if you don't have sensitive or dry skin, then you would probably like this product."
5,It's wonderful,"The original anime collection of shorts was incredible, and the music is equally good. This is top-notch."
5,A wonderful 5 cd set,"I just finished William Buhlman's 5 CD set, ""Discovering Your Past Lives"" with very successful results. The premise of the set is to lead you into a relaxed or hypnotic state and then William's voice will guide you into an exploration of your past lives. In my case, it was very effective, allowing me to experience a vivid past life event with little additional effort on my part. The CD set is very professionally and gently done and the excellent dialog is just as should be, helpful and non-intrusive. This is the equivalent of having a first-rate hypnotic session at less cost, at your convenience, and as many times as you wish. How could I not be impressed? I not only saw the `movie' of myself in a different life, but I was ""in"" the movie....a very satisfying and convincing experience. Thank you Mr. Buhlman !"
4,Glam induced disco punk,"Ida No is sexy. That isn't the only thing Glass Candy have going for them but it is what the band is centered around. She has a sexy shrill voice and a glam rock/ new wave style that will get her compared to Debbie Harry from BLONDIE. She writes interesting lyrics and has a band featuring two other members guitarist Johnny Jewel and drummer Ginger Peach. Together they play ""death disco"" a phrase coined by the band themselves. I am sure everyone will notice the heavy BOWIE influence. That is a really easy comparison.This is a must for fans of the rapture and bands of that dance punk genre.So far they are impressive enough to get in Jane magazine.the title track is my favorite so far.great design too."
5,What was that guy on??,"I don't know what the guy who wrote the review that said that this system is like dog regurgitation was on, but this is definately not a dog's projectile vomit. its bass is quite good if you are looking for a sweet system for your dorm, and its probably very good for some 15 years old who wants to show off for his friends. overall, this system is the living end for anyone who wants to add on to their current system."
2,"Not as good as some others, and at this price. :{","Ussually I am very fond of KLH pieces, but this one has left a very bad taste in my mouth. Going from my other KLH set to this one is like going from candy to eating what the dog left behind. Well I guess they aren't that bad."
4,insightful review of 1955,"There was no other year more influential or controversial than 1955.Eoin Young writes a short but very insightful review of the one year thatmade the most dchanges in auto racing. Young also realises that thechanges were in the U. S. as well as overseas, with the changes to theIndy 500. If you want a short synopsis of 1955, this is the book to read."
1,Only lasted 30 seconds,"I bought this based on the other great reviews, but it definitely didn't stand up to our dog. We have a 1 year old puppy who loves to chew. This literally lasted 30 seconds. She ran into the next room with it, and by the time I caught up with her the seam was busted open and stuffing was coming out everywhere. For less than 5 bucks I didn't expect it to last forever, but I had hoped it would last more than 1 minute."
4,Great while it lasts...,My dogs played tug-of-war with this one...They REALLY loved it!It's a great toy but my girls shredded it within a week.Gave it only 4 stars because of the longevity -But if your dogs aren't super destructive it may last longer for you.
3,Less than 12 minutes....,Our 30 pound toy'r destoy'r took care of the squeeker and the fluff in record time. She does enjoy it though. We were really hoping to have finally found a chew toy that didn't end up in pieces all over the house though... we'll keep looking.
2,Didn't Make It,"Much like the Ethical 9"" Bone, this toy only lasted an hour or so after I gave it to my 8 month old, 8 lb. Toy Fox Terrier. May be OK with an older dog."
3,"Good, if you're a football fan","I didn't enjoy this as much as others in the Point crime series because, although the mystery was clever and intriguing, there was a lot of football information which made the book very boring in parts, especially near the beginning. If you like football, you would probably love this book, which is a mystery set around a football team, Radwick Rangers when someone is murdering the players. There are too many characters to keep track of at first until you sort them out into unimportant and important. Anyway, it was okay but I recommend something like 'Dying For You' more if you're not intrested in football."
3,Nice headphones but still bulky,"I have an average size head and love to watch movies late at night at my paper-thin walled apartment and hence needing to find an excellent light headphone. I get one out of two demands from the Sennheiser headphones HD580. The headphones sounds great but after 30 min. with the headphones I'm ready to take the weights off my head, I placed the item back into the box for a return."
4,Great kids' book about Guatemala,"My 7 year old daughter loved this book. She went out to visit relatives with her dad after spending 2 weeks in Guatemala with the book, and she took the book with her to show them."
3,Too many details -- not the ABC book I was expecting,"My two first graders were adopted from Guatemala and have expressed interest in their birth country. This book and the reviews seemed like it would fit the bill. But there are fare too many words on a page, too many details that are not of interest to beginners. It is nicely illustrated. Might be good for a third grader, though I don't know that a third grader would want to be seen with an ABC book."
5,"Real world ""how-to"" that works","No other info I have ever obtained has so profoundly improved my ability to plan, manage, and deliver work in both my career and home life. It (rightfully) almost totally ignores software p.m. applications and instead informs and instructs on the key factors in successful project management- estimating,organizing/planning,tracking,resource allocation, and the human factors. Simple and universal concepts and approaches that work! If you just want to play with cool looking p.m. software this book is not for you. If you need to learn the principals and techniques of successful project management, you can't do better than this book!"
4,a nice primer on project management,"This book was a required textbook for a project management class I took online at Berkeley. I found the information, templates, and exercises very helpful in starting my path as a project manager.I would recommend this book to those wanting to get the basics in project management, but remember that it is written as a textbook."
4,Good TV; AV Connections Nice,This TV has a good quality picture tube that will work in any small living room. The AV Connections are great (in front and back; S-Video; RCA) to hook up game consoles and DVD from a computer (if you don't own a seperate DVD player). Good TV overall.
3,"Competitors, not regular Janes.",This was an interesting read- it does have alot of good and interesting information- but it seems more geared toward someone getting into figure competitions than your average Jane looking just to get healthy and not hide under a towel in her bathing suit. So if you're serious about competing- give it a read. If you're looking for a general fitness book- pass on this one. MHO.
1,don't buy this book,"This book is so dumb- unless you are a super beginner, then maybe you could pick up some lifitng tips. It wastes time with junk like applying your makeup and getting plastic surgery- even if you do want to read about these things, it displays it in the most basic format.This book was a waste of money!!!I don't recomend it at all!!! It did nothing for my motivation and I didn't learn anything I didn't already know or found interesting.Check out body for life and eating for life for some good stuff :)"
4,"Finally, a theoretical analysis of hate crime","Perry analyzes hate crime through a variety of lenses and ends up framing it brilliantly. As a student of hate crime I am thankful for her thorough portrayal of hate crime as not ABNORMAL but as a hyper-extension of a sexist, racist, homophobic society. She synthesizes what many authors have said. She critiques them thoroughly as well. Excellent job!"
4,Review for core gamer PSP leather case,"Reviewing the above, I can say that this case is one of the best cases out there for the PSP. Unlike other cases, the PSP will not move around inside the case. Upon examing the case, the main compartment has dividers inside, 2 long and 2 short ones. They attach inside with velcro. This means that there is no right or wrong way as to how to arrange them. There is also space on the top for 10 UMD discs. I would recommend using disk jackets to protect them. The case has more then enough pockets to store the PSP, AC adapter, headphones, games, memory stick duo, and anything else that you can think of. When the case is fully closed, there is no way that the PSP can move around inside. The case is built very solidly. Not much more I can say. If you are looking for a very good case for your PSP, get this. Well worth it."
3,"Alright, I suppose","This was the text book for my Cognition class at Rutgers University. It's not organized very well, and is extremely confusing. There are frequent spelling and grammar mistakes, and Glass often makes up his own words, which is laughable at times. Glass obviously has a lot of knowledge about Cognitive Psychology, and a little more attention to the flow of paragraphs would make all the difference. Not to mention a good editor."
2,Not properly identified,"took about a month and a half to get here. no tracking number. did not have the book for the first month of class. would not do business with this ""merchant again"""
4,Loved by my Pembroke Welsh Corgi,"A few years ago, I found this frisbee at my local BigLots. When I saw how much my corgi loved it, I went back and bought all they had. He went through about three or four a year, so I was really glad to find it for sale on Amazon. As the previous reviewer says it is really easy to throw. It is so light that it fall slowly enough for the dog to get under it in time to catch it. It will also roll a nice distance if you give it a slight twist. My corgi likes to run after it as he is getting old to jump up and catch it in the air. It is also good for short-legged dogs since they can grab it through the hole in the middle and still run with it in their mouths."
3,Lacking but good armor reference for artists.,This book really doesn't go into detail about how the medieval soldier lived. It has a bunch of pictures from a reinactment group in europe that are well done but there is really no information in this book about mercenaries or how they lived. What there is is small little paragraphs with big pictures. Its overpriced for what you get.
5,Simply Mind-Blowing,"An atmospheric masterpiece to match the film itself. Traditional Japanese percussion mixed with the best in computer generated sound effects and music, this album will have you listening to its echoey undertones for hours on end and leave you realising that it contributes more to the film than you first thought."
4,waited 15 years for this! Very Pleased!,"Couldn't believe how fast it got here! Thanks so much. Only issue is the last song -on an unblemished disc- won't play. There is nothing visibly wrong with the disc, one would have to play it to know. Great service. Thanks"
5,"Even if you haven't seen the movie, buy it. Its good",Its good. If your an Akira fan you have to have it . But even if you haven't seen the movie the music is great. Lots of instrumentals combining modern sounds and traditional Japanese Noh music.
3,A fairly good collection of music.,"The album is worth buying for only three tracks: Kaneda (the best track on the cd), Exodus From the Underground (second best, upbeat, action-packed ""stunt performing"" music), and Battle Against the Clowns (it really sounds like two street gangs duking it out in hand-to-hand combat in Chinatown) . The rest of the cd is full of boring chanting which got on my nerves. Although it had some scary songs, it was like the Akira movie itself: some scenes were scary, some were really boring, and some where very exciting and cool. Well, this cd reflects the mood of the movie as well as its quirks and flaws. I rate it only average due to the lack of more exciting tracks. The Noh chants were boring to listen to."
5,Great idea,This thing is great. We'd been using a dishwasher basket made for bottles and it took up so much room. This little item clips right on the front and allows for space underneath it. It works with the valves perfectly and takes up so much less space. I wish we'd known about this with our first child.
1,Holds too little for how much room it takes up...,"This didn't work for us. Unfortunately it will cost about as much to send it back as it did to purchase. It is bulky, takes up the space of 2 cups in our upper dishwasher rack (from the picture I thought it was only going to take up one space) it should be deeper to maximize the valuable real estate it occupies. The biggest reason I don't like it is it's limited space: we have boys at both sippy cup and straw cup stages and I was hoping the straws would fit in here also - they don't. I also wanted to be able to put medicine syringes or even the occasional pacifier in, none of these fit. Your duration of use for this item will be limited to only the sippy cup stage..."
3,great so far,It is nice to know that I don't have to worry about losing these thing in the dishwasher. hopefully it continues to works
4,Matches my existing furniture.,"I needed end table to match my sofa set and these did the job. Good quality, happy with my purchase."
4,Lovely tables,The tables compliment my room more than I expected. Prettier in person than on line. No problem assembling the tables. Very easy.
5,"Restful ""celtic"" worship","This is one of my favorite worship CDs. I'm not sure what defines music as truly ""celtic"" or not, but I've long looked for celtic music (especially celtic rock) that praises God.I'd compare this CD as being a Christian equivalent of Enya, but with much more edifying lyrics.Rebecca St. James and others are featured on this CD. Beautiful, melodic worship songs, some with a beat. This is an excellent CD with which to praise our awesome God, a great CD for interpretive or prophetic dance, and an awesome CD for just sitting and relaxing in His presence.I can't comment on Eden's Bridge (see previous post), since I am not familiar with their other works.If you love to worship God and are looking for a celtic worship CD, buy with confidence."
5,quality cd,i was extremely pleased when my cd arrived and how fast it arrived. all the information was accurate and the cd sounds great! i listen to it all the time.
5,Willie Nelson The Complete Atlantic Sessions,"The Complete Atlantic SessionsWillie Nelson His early years his first singing with a record company (Atlantic Records). The Red Haired Stranger Days.Who can beat 61 Willie Nelson songs MP3's(some are repeats)for $2.99Many of the songs were recorded Live at the Texas Opry House in Austin, Texas.This MP3 documents the birth of country music's (Willies)`Outlaw' phase. It also documents The beginning when country music was starting to branch out towards mainstream music in America. This is a album of Willies worth owning and @ only $2.99 I highly recommend it."
3,it was $0.99 how could I lose,"this is not really any of his more famous songs, but if you like Willie Nelson it is a nice supplement to his work. and is was $0.99, so how could I pass this up?"
3,A Must Have...with a caveat,"Now, I have to do something I don't want to do. I have to be honest about this box set. Well, it is Willie's two greatest albums with bonus tracks, and a third CD featuring a long out of print live album featuring recordings from the same era. All packed in a gorgeous box with beautiful art, and all that.The bad news: the two studio albums contained herein sound absolutely AWFUL. I've not bothered to check the waveforms but my ears tell me it's compressed beyond anything acceptable. Having grown to love these albums on vinyl and the older Atlantic CDs, hearing these masterpieces in harsh, loud and ugly fidelity is just sickening.I am very, very glad I kept my Atlantic CD issues, as they sound absolutely gorgeous.So, get this for the bonuses, the live album, the packaging. But keep your Atlantic versions because they sound 100x better."
3,"Solid Willie, but doesn't stand out in his catalogue","Discs 1 and 2 of this compilation contain the complete albums Shotgun Willie and Phases and Stages with tracks in original sequence, along with a bunch of extras from those sessions. The 3rd disc contains live tracks. Solid Willie here but nothing spectacular. If you already have the individual albums you're not adding a lot by getting this. The live disc is ok but nothing special. I've got a couple of other Willie compilations that I find myself listening to instead of this."
3,It was okay,I bought this book as used; had some wear at cover and minor wear at pages but it was readable.
2,Not a good value,"I needed this book for an English class. I found it to be over-priced for what was provided. In addition, many of the essays were student writings from the author's university class. I didn't find them helpful (for critical thinking or writing), nor interesting. With all the wonderful authors in the world, why study these essays for an English writing class?"
3,"Fine as a steak knife, but doesn't hold its edge.","I have several Victorinox knives now, this is the smallest. I liked its shape better than the Victorinox paring knives and bought this knife to use as a paring knife. It doesn't hold its edge as well as the other Victorinox blades I purchased. Considering what it cost, I expected it to hold its edge just as well as the other Victorinox styles. It's fine as a steak knife but it's a lousy paring knife. I think I'd be happier if I hadn't paid quite so much for this knife."
4,"Good, but wanting more","This book has very clear, easy to read maps, driving directions and hiking routes. I just wish that the book gave a little more information: dog friendly?, biking ok? etc. Having a symbol for these things next to the hike in the table of contents would be awesome.Also many of these hikes have entrance/toll/parking fees. It would be nice to knowe how much the fees are. Or at least the website for this information.I've started writing in the book to denote all this information for myself. It would be a nice upgrade on the next version."
4,Excellent value 4CD set of instrumentals.,"This 4CD set contains 8O instrumental tracks , the majority of which are easy listening rather than pop or rock. I enjoyed listening to approximately 60 of the selections ; I am not keen on several of the themes from British TV programmes , although I was very pleased to find a track in this category , "" Eye Level "" by The Simon Park Orchestra , which is very difficult to find on CD. The very wide variety of types of music on this CD means that probably few listeners will enjoy everything , but I would nonetheless recommend it to fans of instrumental music."
1,not so much.,"I bought this guitar as a Christmas present for my nine year old nephew. There are mixed/decent reviews, but the guitar I received was a dud. It arrived with dents in the neck and body (which occurred prior to shipment because they were painted over) and it would not stay in tune no matter how many times I re-tuned it. By the time i would get to the last string, the first one would be off again. If you choose this guitar, I hope you have better luck than I did."
3,Good Beginner Guitar but Had to Restring,"For the price, this was a good little instrument for a 9 year old. The strings were very hard, even for me, so we restrung it and it has held up very well. Still playing 3 years later, although we're going to have to buy something more expensive. But to find out if a child has inclination or talent, this was a very economical and wise purchase."
2,Stan's Review:,Bottom line is that this is a great guitar for the price. The strap knob is plastic and rather chincy and the fretboard does not have those dot thingies but the overall instrument is really nice and sounds good.
3,"Good information, little stories","Like Mr. Franks's others books this one has a lot information about the Albatros units and the most sucesseful pilots, unfortunately that is all. There is no presonal accounts in the book and little accounts of events about the units and the men. The author has done better in other books, like Dieppe. It is a good book for modelers, the artwork is great, but who, like me, looks for more detailed information, will have to look elsewhere. Anyway this book should be a good start."
5,Here is the salt - and now the review,Revised review -The Mosaiques usual great performance and great sound.Have the Mosaiques ever released a bad album? Not that I have seen so far. Always among the best if not the best.
3,Not convinced,"I've been using this cream for about a month - almost every day - but I'm not convinced it's doing anything (it's ok purely as a moisturizer). I also don't like the smell - kind of gluey and unpleasant. I'll continue to use, because it's certainly not doing any harm, but I probably won't repurchase (unless my skin all of a sudden takes a sharp turn for the better)."
2,No tinkling,"I used this product about 12 years back and I remember having a tinkling feeling for the first 3-4 days. At it was only a 5 %, this is 10% and I felt nothing so I'm wondering if it is what it claims to be."
2,Alpha Hydrox Line of Products,"I bought several of the Alpha Hydrox line of products and there are a few I really won""t buy again. This is one of them I do not like the consistency of this product. The night replenishing cream is much better."
4,have not used this long enough!,"The jury is still out on this one. I have read many good things about this product, that it is a great wrinkle reducer, and a great exfoliate. I have not been using it for very long though, so I can't really say how it works. It does give my skin a glow! I use this at bedtime, after cleansing my face. Wait 10 min. before putting it on or else it might sting! Also, don't forget sunscreen!"
4,better buy than the 12% version,"I've used this as well as Alpha-Hydrox's more expensive 12% 'souffle' and find they are both equally effective in suppressing fine wrinkles. The difference is the 10% version costs less and contains 2 oz, while the 12% version is only 1.6 oz and costs more. I guess you're paying for the word 'souffle' -- in actual look and texture, there is no difference between the two. I used the 10% for nearly 10 years, then switched to the 12% about a year ago. The more expensive 12% version worked no better than the less expensive 10% version. I'm going back to the 10% stuff.I'm only giving it 4 stars because I still think the cheaper version is more expensive than it needs to be. However until someone comes along with a less expensive product, it's still the best AHA buy around."
4,It was just what I needed,"I have been looking for Alpha Hydroxy cream for sometime and was delighted to find it on Amazon. It's my favorite sight to shop, so I really wasn't too surprised to find it there. They have everything, and if they don't, they can hook me up to where I might find it. I'm enjoying the cream. It's no miracle cream, but it makes my face and neck feel softer and look softer. At 68 that's a good thing."
3,Works but not wowed,"Product produces a little reddening of my skin and some mild peeling, no stinging. I haven't really noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin, but it was in pretty good shape to begin with."
2,Nothing so far!,"I bought this product because of all the other good reviews, however, I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I have not noticed anything different. Not even sure it moisterizes well. The price of the item is good, but I haven't seen any results from it, very disappointing since I was hoping it would help with my skin, even just evening it out some. It didn't help with any fine lines at all. It would tingle the first few times I put it on but now it just feels like I am putting on a cream."
4,um....?,Wish the cans were larger felt that it was alittle too pricey for only 100ml can and i went through the can vary fast not sure if it was me or if it was do to the size but its just me
3,improv as an artform,Improvis truely one of the most difficult things you could do. It is not for the weak willed or undedicated. You can simply read this book and think well I m going to be a professional. You must work at. I have been taking classes for years and I m still not that good. If you want to learn improv look for classes in your area. Or take acting classes taht have imrpov in them. there is more then just games. True improv is scenes and characters not Blind dating games with characters that pre chosen. Its deeper and more like short scripted play. It doesnt have to be funny.a real improv scene should be impossible to tell from s scrpited one. the purchase of this book will give a well rounded base of improv theory and thinking. If you have already some expierance buy this book to become more well rounded. I suggest you buy this book and read as you take classes not before or after.
1,MISLEADING PRICE,I saw this unit listed for 49 dollars used. None to be found! I am so sick of misleading ads!
4,HIGHLY FAVORABLE,"I'm using MD to transfer vinyl to minidisc and tried using a Sony MZ-R70. The Sony was terrific except for one huge problem: low volume on replay! Excellent if you're running it through an amplifier, but w/headphones, only dogs could hear it. Someone told me that Sony is overly concerned about hearing loss due to a lawsuit. I switched to the Sharp MD-MT15 which plays back great, playback volume and sound quality are all you want, but I miss the automatic recording level capability of the Sony, and the ability to insert track marks at will with the push of a single button."
3,Price gouging????,"I bought a Sharp MD MT15 from Circuit City in August 2000. I paid $179.99 for it. There is absolutely no difference between that unit and the one shown here. Why is this one so expensive?As far as the product goes, it was a very handy tool for a working musician. I kept it in a padded, waterproof container in my briefcase. It worked great for 4 years, then it suddenly quit working in July 2004 for no apparent reason. I got a ""TOC Error"" on every single disk that I loaded. I might consider buying another one - but not without an extended warranty... and I certainly wouldn't pay more than $150 for it!!"
5,The best at the price?,"What are the marketing people doing? Having a holiday? Out to lunch? Dead? This is an amazing piece of kit at the price. Frankly, it's stunning. Why pay more for a personal MD? Put it like this ... I bought this thing more out of curiosity - after I heard it, I bought a Sony minidisc hi-fi for the home, and then I bought a Blaupunkt MD for the car. In fact, the whole MD concept is amazing. Who needs CDs? No-one needs tapes. MD is where it should be at. My advice is that if you don't know about MD, then find out. If you do, then you would do much worse than to buy the Sharp MDMT15S Portable MiniDisc Player/Recorder. And the company ain't paying me anything (yet!). They just got it right first time (like someone got the Lexus 400 right first time). And MD (and the Sharp) is superb. Don't trust me, go out and listen to it, trust your ears, and buy one ... now!."
3,"OK telephone cord, not great","This dove gray 25 foot cord is a good color match for my new Panasonic ""white"" phone. However, it's already starting to stretch out. My old black 25-foot cord had not stretched out in 10 years of use."
3,too big,"these are too big for anyone's face and they came in a cheap sleeve, that was advertised as a hard shell case, lies!! I have the glasses but I can't ever wear them. No meduim size man head or leg is this large, I like the lenses but I hate the glasses"
1,Mind Numbingly Boring,"I read this to my seven-year-old moments ago. The illustration was beautiful, but the writing I found pompously and overly flowery for a children's book. My daughter summed it up perfectly when we had finally trudged through it, ""That was SO boring. Please, never read it again!"""
2,Too wide a frequency spectrum for Comcast Cable,"This is a very good cable signal splitter and it is easy to set up. However, I learned yesterday from a Comcast Cable technician who came to fix a cable box that couldn't communicate that it passes too wide a frequency spectrum for Comcast Cable.Comcast only uses frequencies up to 1 GHZ for its video services. The technician said that allowing signals up to 2.5 GHZ to pass through allowed interference to pass from one connected device to another. That interference, as well as some incorrect cable connections in the house, turned out to be the reason why the Comcast HD cable box could not communicate properly with Comcast's servers (it couldn't get an IP address). In any event,a good quality splitter that cuts off at 1GHZ is what one needs if Comcast is your cable provider."
5,So deep,"This book was nice. It was a true reflection of how some women are really struggling with their breasts. Whether or not they represent happiness on their life, or true hatred. It covers women who undergo surgery to fix themself, a cancer patient who goes through an enormous struggle and other women who just are deeply depressed. It takes you through their own group therapy, in which you feel you are right in the room with them. It's very intense, funny at moments, but also makes you feel you are going through their trials and tribulations with them. It does make you feel more accepting of yourself in the end, and you no longer feel alone in your struggle."
5,Now THIS is music.,"Wow. This soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. I bought this CD about a year ago at the local Suncoast, and I was immediately hooked. I mean, I have several anime soundtracks, from Blue Seed to Ah! Megami-sama, and even Fushigi Yugi. But, I have to say, this is one of the few CDs that I can listen to all the way through, and still be satisfied. The songs are magnificent. From French to Japanese, and even English, the vocal songs are mellow and harmonic. They are quite beautiful. Even the songs without words, which I usually skip when it comes to anime soundtracks, are amazing. They combine music from practically every race and culture. African, American, Chinese, Japanese, it's all here! Even classical and modern are combined. So, basically, I would definately recommend this CD to anyone who does not want to just waste their money on a CD with one or two good songs. If I had to sum up this CD in one word, it would definately be ""masterpiece"". So buy this CD! ^-^"
5,Simply the finest soundtrack,"Macross Plus...Top Gun with a great twist. And the only way to treat the movie right is to give it a wonderful soundtrack. It's here. Macross Plus Soundtrack II is one of my all time favorite CD's. Just try it. If you liked the Anime, you'll want this disc."
2,Looks nice but...,"I bought several packages of these connectors to finish out a media room install.I experienced two major flaws in the design of these items.1. The spade part is just pressed into the collar of the connector. I found this because I was holding the spade part of the connector with pliers while tightening the connection. With a medium force the spade part turned in the collar. With just a bit of effort I was able to separate the two parts. To remedy the situation I removed the plastic insulators, and used a propane torch to solder the two parts using electrical solder.2. The second issue is that the fork part is too long. If care is not taken to align the connector the forks are long enough to short out to each other. To remedy this problem I cut off enough of the fork end to prevent shorting.If you are not handy or very careful you may experience separated connectors or unintended shorts. However once reworked the connector are very sturdy and useful."
5,Acoustic Research spade connectors,"I love Acoustic Research A/V connectors! I have both their banana plugs and their spade connectors, and they are easy to install, solid, and fit well (even with thicker gauge wire). Easy to feed wire in and tighten it down. NOT all connectors work the same (even though they may look similar), so beware..."
1,"Absolute Garbage. What a shame, too.","Bootleg DVD.The sole DVD of Chicago's classic '70s line-up, including the guitarist Terry Kath (just before his untimely death) is, unfortunately, a completely unauthorized TV-to-videotape affair off a circa-1977 VCR, by the looks (and sounds) of things found here. Horrible audio throughout, BTW, with lots of drop-outs. Chicago is in good form, but you can't really see much through the dark, blurry murk.Why does Amazon sell anything by ""XXL,"" the firm taking credit for this video piracy disaster?."
4,Great primer on practical utilization of your intuition,"Ms. Peirce has written a well organized approach to seeing your intution as a valuable tool, not just a once-in-a-while whimsy. A trained intuitive herself, Penney Peirce is full of encouragement as well as clearly laid out exercises to allow one to hone their intuitive skills and incorporate the benefits into daily life. I would recommend this book to those embarking on their first inward journey (no matter at what age!). There are abundant benefits to the practice she outlines in this honest and heart-felt presentation. Again, asking that question of mastery: How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice."
5,Enjoyable Book,"Lots of really good, life changing information. As with all books, I eat the grass, spit out the sticks......but have learned a lot from this book."
5,This is a must read,This book is a great resource and full of information that is very helpful in som many situations. Really enjoyed the read.
4,A very useful and inspiring read,"The intuitive dimension is the most important defining part of our nature yet is seldom given the attention it deserves. This book is a very welcome addition. The intuitive intelligence that we all possess works in the quiet mind - we have to listen very closely, with an open mind and heart. Needless to say, mindfulness is one of the key awareness skills for discovering the subtle dimension of our being. I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."
4,Fabulous!,Penny's writing style is easy and flows! She takes the reader on a wonderful Journey towards themselves with fun and joy.
4,Great so far!,"So far I have received many insights from this book. It is a lot of inner self-work, but I am pleased with the clarity I am receiving."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED :(,"After taking a look at the whole book, I discovered that this book is truly only helpful to those who have no clue about how to plan a bridal/baby shower (complete idiot's guide). I have given a baby shower before and was looking for some new interesting ideas. I wouldn't recommend buying this book for ideas on games. This book was not worth the amount I spent on it. 'The Baby Shower Book: Etiquette, Decorations, Games, Food' by: Pauline Glendenning is a great book that has everything in it, especially great games!!!"
5,I have used it for 2 showers & it worked out great for both!,"I really liked this book because it did not try to give you so much information just to fill the pages. All of the hints were smart and well thought out, as were the games and recipes. I got a different book for games (it had 200 games in it) and I found only one or two that were perhaps worthwhile. This book doesn't have many games, but I used almost all of them - they are good ones, not a waste of time. I would recommend this to you if you are planning a shower, bridal or baby. I also used some of the recipes and they turned out very good. I think the SOS scallops were the biggest hit. Some of the drinks turned out great too. Good luck to you! Hint: I used the facts that are throughout the book as my questions/answers in ""Bridal Jeopardy"". Everyone was interested and enjoyed it!"
4,Very Helpful!,"I found the book instrumental in planning the shower I am hosting, especially since I am a host virgin. The author presents all the tiny details that could go wrong, and those that could make your shower perfect. The checklists and worksheets were beneficial to my planning process; I have the budget, plans, and addresses all written in the book for the shower.The only drawbacks were the themes and games. Unoriginal. I have heard of all of them and have even played most all of the games. I have created my own theme and games.The book is divided equally between baby and bridal showers, so I know I will be using it again in a few years... Now I feel totally prepared to give the perfect bridal shower!"
3,Better,"Not as good as the ""Red"" trilogy, but better than her others. I'll definitely give her another shot."
4,Enjoyable - Quick Read,"This is a great paperback to take on vacation. It is quick paced, interesting, and not heavy.There are times when I want a large deep book but there are other times when life is burdensome enough and I just want a little escape... this is a good choice for those times."
1,Lousy Quality,I have had TWO of these MDMT15 players fail on me. One did not work out of the box. I returned it and the new one failed one month out of warranty. Sharp would not repair it. I am an audiophile and keep my electronics in pristene condition. This player is of horrible quality and I would encourage anyone to buy a sony over sharp's bad quality.
5,Serves it purpose,"The item serves the purpose for what I bought it. An erasing shield.Sent from my iPad Generation One, model two five six eight nine ""c"""
2,A waste of money,"Here is a sample recipe from the book: put toast in toaster, wait until it pops up, add butter. I wanted real, healthy, hearty, easy recipes and found this book to be a waste of money."
2,11dB signal loss,"I replaced an old ""no name"" splitter with this splitter in preparation for switching from Comcast to Verizon FiOS. I viewed regular (not HD) TV with this splitter prior to switching to FiOS, and the picture quality was fine. Also, my Comcast cable modem was connected to this splitter without any problems.The Verizon technician measured the signal strength on entry and exit from this splitter as part of the installation, and he told me that the signal loss was 11dB and not 7.5dB as written on the splitter. He replaced this splitter with a 4-way PDI Mega Splitter he brought with him, and he showed me that the signal loss of the PDI splitter was 7.5dB as expected.In summary: signal loss is much higher than advertised."
5,Great performance and price.,"This product is an important branch point in my home cable TV network. All downstream points look good. Three are direct, one splits again three ways. Again, all look good. Good price and good performance. I would chosse this one again over others I looked at."
4,"Great music, great voice, crappy lyrics","This album is perfect for driving fast and a great album to play in the background as you do something else, but put on your earphones and you soon discover how horrid the lyrics are in these songs! I love Garbage and their first album is one of my all time favorite cds, but this one is only a 4 star because the songs are filled with cliches and cheesy ""tough girl"" sentiments. What happened to original song lyrics like in ""My Lover's Box""?"
4,They're back...,"Garbage was always on the fringe of mega-success. Once they found it, they were given license to try new a new sound. Well, they're back to what they do best - ROCK. Bleed Like Me, is as much of a rocker as it is, excuse the dirty words, Alternative cd. One can't ignore the guitar in Why Do You Love Me. Then there is the techno rock anthem of Metal Heart and finally you are 'clubbed' to death by Boys Wanna Fight.I just wish someone confessed to playing bass in this band! All in all, sit back, and enjoy!JM88"
3,"Not bad, but disappointing","I'm a big fan of Garbage. I have all the previous cds, and I was really looking forward to this one, but I was pretty disappointed. It's not that it's bad, because it isn't. But it lacks a lot of the energy from previous albums. If you're a fan, it's worth getting, but I think the album is a little flat. The sound, not the cd. Of course the cd is flat."
5,Let it bleed,"What can you say about Garbage that has not been said before? Their rage and power were the heart of what was the mid to late nineties. Comprised of electronica, goth, and punk, Butch Vig and Duke Erikson created this super-strength goliath that will always be legendary. Shirley Manson is the ultimate female singer. She has the beauty of Debrah Harry, the attitude of Patti Smith, the writing ability of Chrisie Hynde, and the soulfulness of Annie Lennox. Gwen Stefani can't touch her with a ten foot pole.This album marks their I guess you can say their rebirth because like with all bands there were problems. The problems were going to end the band but their love for their music resolved that.The songs are similar to what they have released in the past. Songs like ""Why do you love me?"" deals with Shirley's break up with her husband. Eventhough my personal favorite album is 2.0, this album will soon be a classic as well."
4,Garbage grow up,"Garbage have definitely grown up and in the process have lost some of the simplicity of youth. Which means that whilst the album is not as strong as Garbage 2 or Beautiful Garbage, it has a new depth and feeling. As with other reviews, my first impression was that the album was a little bland and suffered from not having the happy-go-lucky/poppy feel of G2 and Beautiful Garbage. Having listened to it 3/4 times and seen them perform live in NYC, this album matures on further listening.In short this album is not quite up to the stratospheric heights of V2 or Beautiful but is far superior to anything else on offer currently. Perservere with the album and you will not be disappointed."
2,Underwhelming at best,"To be fair, Garbage is unique band in this day and age. They seem to dabble in several different musical areas, including rock and electronic with a dark and nearly goth-like aura.In that sense, I can only compare this album to their previous works. To say the least, I am utterly underwhelmed by this album. Most of the lyrics and tracks sound like those of Nina Gordan, Sheryl Crow, or Meredith Brooks on a bad day.The sole track that even catches my attention is ""Metal Heart"". It reminds me of the feeling and attitude of their first couple of albums. All of the other tracks pretty cause you to space-out after the third listen.Some of the content even seems to be poorly engineered. The lyrics and music fail to mesh well. One has to wonder if the band members communicated at all during the creative process."
5,A Great CD From Shirley Manson & the Guys !!!!!!,"There have already been many reviews on this one, so I'll just mention a few things. This is probably the best CD from Garbage. ""It Rocks"". It contains the hits: ""Why do You Love Me"", & ""Bleed like Me"". It contains a total of 11 songs. This is a very ""up-beat"", and ""entergentic"" cd. So if you like that kinda of rock, you should like this one. Thanks!!!!"
4,good CD + cool video,"Weaker overall than the first two CDs, but still 4-5 terrific songs, and I didn't see anyone else mention the very cool video for ""Why Do You Love Me"" included on the CD -- don't miss it! -- makes it worth springing for the CD."
3,LO MISMO DE SIEMPRE,"Al que le guste Garbage que lo compre, no cambia. Solo una rola parece que salio de lo mismo y cantan como Pat Benatar. A mi si me gusto"
2,good at first then gets stale,"garbage shirley manson the female singer with a lot of balls in male dominated rock world where most girl singers get laughed at..but there are some mighty fine girl singers ETC joni mitchell, the cranberriesi love stupid girl single which got me onto garbage then i heard""why do you love me"" and ""sex is not the enemy"" and i thought heavy riffs good songs and i bought the album with the slip case cover and at first i thought it was fantastic and over the past 6 months i've had it i've not listened to it once it's just sat on my shelf gathering dust and i wonder why?it's because after the offical listen you think wow good lyrics about relationships and the heavy guitars keep you entertained for the first listen but the second time you put this in the next day you see through all the clinches and distortion and feel that the whole album well is empty and faulsely presentedgreat voice hollow album sorry"
2,Biggest disappointment ever,"After beautifulGarbage came out I thought Garbage was my favorite band and they could do no wrong. I liked how they mixed it up with some more rock songs like ""Silence is Golden"", intense songs like ""Nobody Loves You"" and a very unique style for ""Androgyny"" and ""Cherry Lips"".This new album is not very good. Most of the songs are dreary and kind of boring and repetitive, especially ""Why Don't You Come Over?"" and ""Bleed Like Me"". Don't waste your money on this."
2,Nothing shocking here.,"As for the editorial review, that guy must be high to even mention the frontwoman of this band and Chrissie Hynde in the same sentence. I usually don't even read the editor reviews on Amazon because I have not found one that actually critizes any of the bands or musicians they review. I don't know about you but can every single group in the world be good. As far as this album goes, it is a definant turn for the worse for these guys, in fact aside from their first works they really havn't done anything of value. In my opinion they should have left the catalog just the way it was."
3,I wasn't very impressed,"after listening, owning, and enjoying their first two albums, this one is kind of a let down. I cant' explain why I feel that way, just that it didn't have the same impact as the first two for me."
5,Shirley Manson returns to her dark roots...,"I'm what you call a ""passive"" fan.But this cd is amazing.The best Garbage album by far.Instead of ok electro pop,Garbage made the best rock album of 2005 (so far).Anthemic,punky hook-laced guitar rock heightened by Shirley Manson's distinctive wail and sarcastic come-ons.""Bad Boyfriend"" and ""Between the Eyes"" kick genuinely harder and stronger then all the wimpy hit-driven modern ""retro"" bands combined.But the best song is the chillingly haunting and beautiful title track (perhaps the saddest song in Alt.Rock since Nine Inch Nails ""Hurt"".)I had to press the repeat button over and over.Garbage take the listener to a very dark place,and you dont want to leave.Bleed Like Me is a career high for sure."
2,Disappointing,"Basically, I just don't hear any real originality on this CD. ""Bad Boyfriend"" is okay, the title track is decent. But those are the best tracks, and neither are as good as anything on their first two CD's."
5,One of Garbage's Best!,"This CD is actually amazing. In the beginning I was a little weirded out by the title track, but then I understood the depth of the song. Garbage is a very smart, emotional band. Shirley Manson... amazing! I rock out on Right Between the Eyes. Other favorites: It's All Over but the Crying, Bad Boyfriend, Run Baby Run. I believe this to be as good as the 'Beautiful Garbage' album.. which is EXCELLENT! An album to own for sure..."
3,"Good, but lacks the hooks of previous work.","If you've seen Garbage on their recent tour, then you may notice what I did - that the bulk of their set consists of songs from the first two albums, the third album seems almost entirely ignored, and there seems to be quite a bit of passable-but-forgettable filler between the recognizably great tunes.That filler would be most of this album. Don't get me wrong, it's a good disc - it just seems to lack the punch, the sharpness, the pull of the previous albums. If you're a fan, by all means make sure to pick it up. If you're not familiar with them, I'd suggest their self-titled debut album or ""Version 2.0"" as better introductions."
5,THANK GOD THEY ARE BACK SHIRLEY MANSON HAS DONE IT AGAIN,"INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLE!im so glad theyre backpersonally i never liked the last 2 albums they released and i always thought their first self titeld album was the best but nowBLEED LIKE ME TOPS IT!ITS BRILLIANT!best songs in my opinon are bleed ike me, and it's all over by the crying.this cd sounds alot like their older stuff which is what i really love about them. Be sure to catch them on tour too!as shirley manson says in Why Do You Love Me- ""I GET BACK UP AND I DO IT AGAIN"""
5,best band ever!!!,"too bad they broke up, but this album is a tie with version 2.0, shirley manson only gives her best in everyone of her music. she is a truly talented woman...wish the band hadn't broken up though.The new songs are incredibly wonderful."
4,Takes a Band Like Garbage to Make Music That's Not,"BIG fan of Ms. Shirley here--she almost sounds kittenish in spots on this record, even more so than on any of their past efforts. I have to admit to never once being disappointed by her unadulterated vox--her voice is rock-steady with no want of scale hopping, fake cigarette rasps or shrillness that irritates.Garbage has not lost their ability to provide interesting contrast between parts within a song and their sound is as edgy as it ever was. They've taken the right 4 years off and fortunately didn't get sucked into the pop-rock wasteland.I've waited patiently for some stuff that makes it okay to get up and dance to the beat of your issues and sink into some well-earned depression. It's far better than painting the smile on during the Bush era."
4,"Easy to listen to, fun and poppy, with a rock edge-feel","Bleed Like Me is better than Garbage's last album, Beautiful Garbage. It's on the same level as 2.0, but not as good as their self-titled debut. Songs are inspired and just fun to listen to, although I did miss some of Butch Vig's experimentation with earlier albums. Bleed Like Me, in the words of Vig, has ""got a great sexual swagger and a cheeky bravado"". Couldn't have said it better myself. Definitely worth buying if your a Garbage fan and if you're not, have a sample listen and I'm sure you will be a fan soon enough."
4,Waiting Forever,"It seems like I was waiting forever for a new Garbage CD. While this is not their best, I like it alot. If you are a true Garbage lover this CD is for you. If you are not....you may want to stay away - explicit lyrics."
1,Very Disappointing,"It may be harsh to say that Garbage is releasing garbage, but the letdown I received from this album is huge. I have been a fan of Garbage since they first hit the scene, and have to say that to me, this sounds nothing like their previous work-- and that's not a good thing. The music may be heavier, but Manson's vocals just do not seem to mesh with it. They lack the grittiness and strength needed to pull off this album. With the exception of a couple of tracks (Bad Boyfriend, Boys Wanna Fight), this cd was a waste of money. It's also safe to say that I wouldn't even have missed those. Save yourself some time and money. Borrow from a friend if you just ""have"" to hear it. Trust me on this one."
2,Garbage have sadly lost their edge...,"This album is quite a disappointment...from their brilliant self-titled debut to their amazing follow up Version 2.0...I thought this was a band that would become legendary...but they've lost any edge that they used to have with this album with only a couple of mildly catchy tunes(like Boys Wanna Fight). What really lets them down this time are the lyrics IMO...for example on ""Why do you love me"" you get lines such as 'and I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines.....why do you love me?'...I'm sorry...but that's more suited to Ashlee Simpson than to a once gutsy, strong, independent Shirley."
2,I Don't Get It,"If you are expecting or really enjoyed ""Beautiful Garbage"" this is not the CD for you. When artists shift styles, it tends to polarize fans. This CD seems like a shadow of Version 2.0 while ""Beautiful Garbage"" was a progression to new things. While most of the tracks on ""Bleed Like Me"" do rock, they seem to blend together as I listen to the CD. I've played it through 3 times, and I haven't found a compelling reason to play it again. Whether or not you liked the electronic sound of ""Beautiful Garbage"", the vocal hooks were quite strong. ""Cup of Coffee"" had a good flow and a really sad mood to it. ""Silence Is Golden"" had energy and emphasized Shirley's vocals. On ""Bleed Like Me"", the vocals are too repetitive as is the case with ""Why Do You Love Me"". If you like nondescript rock, buy this CD. Otherwise, you should skip it."
3,Under the RADAR,"I didn't know anything about this album's release until I heard ""The Boys Wanna Fight"" at a club. And after buying it, I can see why. Aside from that track, ""Bad Boyfriend"", and ""Bleed Like Me"" this album is pretty mediocre. If you're a fan of Garbage from way back, then it's a pretty decent buy. Otherwise, I wouldn't even bother."
3,No young blood,"A good comeback, fortunately, but the more innovative days of the band are far. The first single is their worst ever, and while most of the other songs here are worthwhile, only ""Metal Heart"" shows greatness. Still, Shirley's voice is always interesting and the lyrics are just as intriguing."
4,"A great comeback (even if I did like their last album, too)","The good ol' days of Garbage will always be special to me and, in my mind, Garbage will probably never do work to surpass their records from the nineties, but Bleed Like Me at least comes close to equaling them. The passing of time has definitely changed the band, but it is far from for the worse."
5,Nice!,"After listening to this entire album, I can say that the four year wait was well worth it. Garbage has set a high bar with tracks like ""Stupid Girl"", ""Special"" and ""Push It"" in the past, yet ""Bleed Like Me"" only builds on their incredible sound and poignant lyrics, with songs you can't stop humming even after the CD is done playing. With a mixture of low-tempo rock songs, and faster-paced Inxs-Bangles-Aerosmith hybrid tracks, this album is full of future classics inclyding ""Bad Boyfriend,"" ""Right Between The Eyes,"" ""Sex Is Not The Enemy"" and ""Boys Wanna Fight"" (my favorite track on this album). Although any CD from this talented band is a safe bet, ""Bleed Like Me,"" showcasing Shirley Manson's haunting voice and the band's powerful lyrics, will be played for a long time to come on CD players and iPods all over the world."
5,excellent,"Out of all the books on learning Greek that I have gone through, this is the best in terms of detail. Some books have good explanations, but poor charts; and other books have good charts, but poor explanations. This book, however, has good charts and explanations. This is great for those being taught or tutored. It is also great for review and greater understanding of the grammer. However, this book may be overwhelming for those teaching themselves Greek because of all the information presented in this 400 page book."
4,Review of Mastronarde's Introduction to Greek,"To me, Mastronarde represents the classical introduction to a foreign language. His chapters contain precise notes on grammar and his reading are drawn directly from Greek texts.While this method of training students in Greek is effect, I feel that modern, reading-intensive text book like Athenaze are superior, especially for self-study.Also, I wish Mastronarde would have included notes on Koine Greek, and perhaps biblical passages as well.The most important criticism I can make about this work is that its effective, although terribly boring."
2,Terrible...!,"We like the ""Maisy"" books -- good, simple, colorful stories, not a lot of intellectual heft. But good golly, these animated shorts are just terrible!!! The narrator sounds completely bored (and secretly contemptuous of the material) and the character voices consist mainly of moronic giggle-babbles that sound a lot like the TeleTubbies. It's really insulting to the intelligence of even the youngest viewers. Plus, the age group that this is suited to developmentally (one-year olds) shouldn't be watching videos anyway: recent studies suggest that watching TV -- any kind of TV -- in the first two years of life holds back language development and shortens attention span. This video is not worth the risk. (Axton)"
3,Slightly entertaining,"I bought this Maisy DVD for my two year old with the idea that it would have some educational content. Charlie, Cyril, Eddie, Maisy, and Tallulah do not use language to speak but instead make silly sounding noises. Children at this age are still learning language and other than the narrator, there was none. The plots of the stories were also simple. It was cute and somewhat entertaining. However, I would not recommend it to a parent who wants his/her child to be exposed to speech/language."
3,"Nice quality, beware of the dimensions","Nice quality wire but note that it is FLAT cable - so may be difficult to run the cable through ducts, walls etc compared to normal round cable."
5,Great,I bought this for the color. It matches the color of my walls. I'm not running it under carpet. It's kind of an eggshell color instead of bright white.I had no trouble stripping and cutting the wire. The sound is excellent. Mine didn't have a compression connection at the end. It was just straight wire.
5,Just Perfect,"These panties are cute, comfortable, and don't give the dreaded ""panty line"" under trousers. The cotton boy shorts are stretchier and fit a bit closer than the microfiber version. I wear both styles and enjoy them equally. A+!"
3,"Cotton, pretty, but ride up!","I ordered one item, hoping that it wouldn't ride up like other boy shorts are prone to do. They are cotton, and look pretty, but I was disappointed that the lace didn't keep the boy shorts from riding up."
3,Okay but not stellar,"I bought several brands of boyshorts trying to figure out which worked best for me. I have always had the problem of larger thighs so I get a lot of ""curling"". Seems crazy that I go for boyshorts but I like the coverage. I found these to be the most ""granny"" in appearance but the finished legs left few panty lines if they didn't bunch up. I'm sure they would appeal to a lot of people. They are, it should be said, more durable than other styles I purchased."
1,I will stick with the microfiber version of these.,These arrived on time and in good condition. They are well made. Unfortunately they ride up terribly. I wear the microfiber version of the same product from the same manufacturer and those fit great. Go figure.
2,good memory but not ECC,If you want ECC you need part #CT2KIT25672AA667 not sold here. I had to return this because it did not work as I have a server that must have ECC.
4,Gettysburg (American Battlefields) Review...,"Gettysburg: July 1-3, 1863, is an excellent, albeit all-to-brief, examination of the three day battle in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Given that it is less than 20 pages, there really isn't space for detailed analysis of the strategy and tactics employed by both sides nor of the men who fought the battles. If you want those details, look elsewhere.This is a good way to introduce young travelers to the Gettysburg battlefield prior to a visit to the national park."
5,very descriptive informative book,this book has everything to know for a great background of the civil war. it is filled with charts and diagrams of civil war baattles. i think its a really good book if your doing a small project on gettysburg
1,Not nearly enough,"This book should have an addition to its title: ""In Your Dreams."" This book is just awful. Please don't waste your money on it. If you are a total beginner, you will be lost from the start. If you are an accomplished user trying to move into administration (as I am), you'll find that there is no meat in this book whatsoever. It is padded with the authors philosophies about administration rather than with any real information. The end of the book is just a meaningless collection of junk added for thickness purposes. Unless you are a UNIX administrator before you begin reading this book, you WILL NOT be a UNIX administrator when you finish."
5,I love it..................,Blasted from the past with original song rerecorded with true audio quality. I wish more of the original groups and songs were done like this CD. Thank you.......
4,Their best collection yet!,"Out of all the ""best of"" Rare Earth CD's that have been released over the years, this covers their very best in just 7 songs. It features their first 6 Hot 100 singles (in their album versions), and their one track I refer to as their masterpiece, ""Ma"" (all 17+ minutes of it). The only way this collection could be better is, if they also included the single version of ""(I know) I'm Losin' You"". The album version is made to be more psychedelic (which is great), but the shorter single version really rocks. It's faster and it has a more intense beat. Apart from that, this really is a fantastic CD."
4,Rare Find,"Rare, not just because some of these tracks are hard to find, and they are the full length album versions, but also because this is a ""20th Century Masters"" CD that has almost 70 minutes of music on it!I've looked at other 20th Century Masters titles and always decided they were a bad deal for the money, even though they were cheap, but this one's different. To top it all off: the sound quality is top notch."
3,tHE BEST OF RARE EARTH,"tHE BEST OF RARE EARTH - 20 th Century MasterSO LONG SOME SONGS, BUT in general IT'S REALLY VERY GOOD SELECTION"
5,THE BEST OF RARE EARTH,"I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS ALBUM FOREVER AND NOW THAT I HAVE IT I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE, LOVE THIS CD"
4,Great musicianship,"This Rare Earth CD showcases great musicianship and the long, flowing concert-style arangements which charaterized many early '70s rock groups. The soulful vocals, tight-precise percussion, and tasteful instrumental work are a treat! If you're looking for 3 minute commercial radio studio versions, this is not it."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITE CD's,I grew up loving Rare Earth. Wish I could get a teeshirt. lol. I sing along in the car....especially loving Get Ready..but all the songs are fabulous. It's also one of my favorites to listen to when in a romantic setting. It revs me up. I have alot of wonderful memories listening to this one.
5,Being and Non Being,"This is one of the best back of to the time discs I can think of, offhand. The first track, for instance, takes me back to hyperrealities I only can flashback about these days. Strap yerself in and have fun trying to harmonize with even the first track, ""Get Ready.."" and see/hear what free improv was all about back in the day!! The drum solo will not annoy you, I hope.Let's not forget ""Big Brother,either! It's still relevant! Play it to to your kids!He's still out there somewhwere, and if we don't get our thing together he'll still be out there watching us and doing something with the info! Not sure what. But do we need to guess?BEK"
3,Toooo much!,"Overall: okay. The first cut is the loooong version of ""Get Ready"", with endless, interminable, instrumental solos. I have yet to listen to the entire song. The album version may not always be the best."
5,Best surprise of the 21st century...!!!,"I never, EVER expected a Millennium Collection to overwhelm me like this. I've been a Rare Earth fan since forever, but I never thought I would find a digital collection this good. The sound quality is excellent. The original album extended versions are absolutely priceless, MasterCard notwithstanding. It carries me back to the day for a while. Amazing and excellent."
2,Beautiful interpretation let down by sound,"ECM has a habit of bringing beautiful music with usually okay sound. Not on this one.Granted, music comes first and foremost. But when instruments sound like they are made of tin and drowned into a glassy reverb, I just can't relate anymore. It's just amazing that in this day and age, such a serious company could release such a bad (once more, from a technical point of view), recording. This CD is a textbook example of why people think CD sounds bad and go back to vinyl.If you don't listen to your CDs on a good stereo but in your car on your way to work, you might be able to get over it."
3,Postmodern version,"I must confess that I had high hopes from this version of the Art of Fugue. I found it very uneven. Many of the fugues succumb to the current tendency to hyperactive, vibrato-less, quasi-jazzy interpretations that must be fun to perform and utterly tedious to listen (at least as far as this pair of ears is concerned). Yet, I did find a few gems here and wished that the performers, a truly skilled team, had given a little bit more love, beauty and harmony in their interpretation."
4,Bought it for my Cockatoo,"Well my bird seems to like it, although the bell and the colorful ball/beads don't really call to her but she loves the latter. The only downsize to it would be that for a cockatoo, i think it should be a little bigger but for a parakeet it would be perfect. Also the swing did not have that much space to swing and it was too low, so my bird did not even bother with it after trying it once."
1,Cockatiel Play Gym,Not very happy with this item. My baby cockatiel chewed it to bits in no time. A very flimsy piece. Would not recommend for cockatiels.May be better for parakeets.
1,Bad Product,This play gym fell apart before I had it out of the box. Theglue is cheap that they used and hazardous to my parrots. AfterI put it back together my Sun Conures didn't even play with it and itsmelled like a chemical so I disposed it. Waste of money and unhappyparrots. I do not recommend this product.
4,Good CD,"Radio Disney Jams 3 is a good cd. The only thing I don't like about this cd is when a song begins, you hear the previous song just ending. Commonly called a crossfade with no break in between tracks. This would drive you crazy if you upload these songs to your iPod."
5,Love it,"As always, the Radio Disney CD was a huge hit with my kids (and even me). The collection of songs never fails."
1,Didn't get what I ordered,"I ordered Disney jam vole.3. But received Disney jams vole.4.The front insert in case is for Disney jams vole.4 but the back insert with list of songs is for Disney jams vole.3.For cd inside is for vol.4, not what I ordered.Somehow I received a vol.4 cd with a list of vol.3 songs, Not very useful!Disappointed but not worth my money or time to send back."
2,What happened here?!,"I have to say that I don't like Radio Disney's Kid Jams volume 3 all that much. It just doesn't really have very good songs. A lot of them are pretty cheesy and corny, especially that Hamster Dance song - - it is just so annoying! The only songs I really like are the ones by Smash Mouth and Britney. But where's the Backstreet Boys? Where's Aaron Carter? The CD is just not the same without them! And what happened to all of the good songs that came from volume 2? Sorry, but this is just not my thing."
2,What happened here?!,"I have to say that I don't like Radio Disney's Kid Jams volume 3 all that much. It just doesn't really have very good songs. A lot of them are pretty cheesy and corny, especially that Hamster Dance song - - it is just so annoying! The only songs I really like are the ones by Smash Mouth, BBMak, A*Teens, and Britney. I also think the one by Deblah Morgan is good, but I like her original version for the song better then the Radio Disney version. But where's the Backstreet Boys? Where's Aaron Carter? The CD is just not the same without them! And what happened to all of the good songs that came from volume 2? Sorry, but this is just not my thing."
4,Steamer Insert is phenomenal,"The universal steamer insert has been a great addition to our cookware. We had the old collapsable steel insert that didn't fit a large amount of vegetables when we needed to steam them. The insert has been a great replacement and fits multiple pots depending on the amount of vegetables to be steamed. On top of this, is that we didn't need to buy a whole other pot with steamer insert. Thank you Calphalon for making this an easy decision for us!"
3,Not tri-ply stainless,"The Calphalon website shows this as tri-play stainelss. This does not match the other tri-ply stainless cookware I have. The handles are smaller and the shape of the handles does not match the tri-ply. Hard to hold the handles becasuse they are so small. The lid is a cheap version of the tri-ply lid. Having said that the steamer fits ok, but not perfectly, on the tri-ply saucepans and will serve it's purpose.It loses one star becuse it is not tri-ply stainless and one star because it is overpriced even at the sale price."
3,Not so universal,"I got this to go with my contemporary stainless. Beware - it does not fit! I wish the product description would include what is says on the box, it clearly tells you which products it fits.I can only give it 3 stars because of the Amazon product description"
4,A bit on the smaller side,"Inner diameter at the top - 8in; depth - 4 in. Tapers slightly towards the bottom.What it fits: [From the box] fits Calphalon Professional Hard-Anodized, Calphalon Commercial Nonstick and Calphalon Professional Nonstick; fits 2.5,3.5 and 4.5 qt. sauce pans & sauce potsI found it also fits 2.5 and 4.5 qt. pots from Calphalon Tri-Ply setCalphalon Tri-Ply Stainless-Steel 13-Piece Cookware Set.It is a bit on a smaller side. Large lobster will not fit whole, you'd have to break it up."
3,Steamer insert doesn't seat well,"The Calphalon steamer insert and lid are well-made, but the unit doesn't fit well in the Calphalon Contemporary Stainless cookware set. I think it was made for the Tri-ply series, but Amazon advertised it as part of the Contemporary series. It works well enough, I guess, but I do wish it fit the pan more firmly."
2,Dosen't fit Calphalon Contemporty 15 pc set,Bought this with the Calphalon Contemporary stainless steel 15 piece set. This steamer doesent fit in any of these pans. The handles on the pan are really pathetic and the lid doesn't fit tightly in the steamer insert basket. The stainless steel finish is the same as the pan set finish and the stamp ensured it is real Calphalon. I seller had no problem recieving returns and has issued me a RMA number within two days.
3,The skin on my legs and arms is ...,"The skin on my legs and arms is usually dry and there are very few lotions that can help. Unfortunately, Revlon's Aquamarine Body Lotion with Aloe isn't among those. My dry skin remained dry, and in fact the skin on my arms seemed to become dryer with each use. It got to the point where there was some flaking. The bottle states it helps """"normal to dry skin"""", but I wouldn't recommend this lotion for those with severely dry skin. What I like about this product is that you get a lot for your money. It's a good value for those with normal skin. I also liked the fragrance. The scent lasted all day long, yet it wasn't strong. I'd use this product again, but only on parts of my skin that weren't too dry."
5,Best Lotion Ever,"I have used this lotion for 20+ years. I have tried more expensive lotions, but none compare. It does have a scent, but not very strong. It leaves my skin feeling great and it doesn't go on oily. Having said that, it is getting harder and harder to find this lotion. I have even recently contacted Revlon asking where I can purchase it and waiting a reply."
1,Fragile Joints,"Some of the other reviews claim that the joints that allow you to fold up the headphones would break, and they are right. In fact, it would appear that all three joints have the potential of breaking. Me and my friend got a pair, and one of the joints on the side broke, and mine broke from the joint in the back. I also suspect the wiring to be pretty cheap too. It's good for a couple of months, but it is not built to last. Interesting concept with the detachable microphone, but you are definitely better off buying something more durable for the price."
2,"Great sound, but really uncomfortable","While the sound on these is good, there is a major design flaw. The channel which the cord is run through was left open, facing the top of your ears. The result, very sharp edges pressing into your skin. I'm taking these back tomorrow."
2,at least the pictures are fun....,"I was disappointed in this book after hearing friends rave about it. The illustrations are beautiful and the theme is endearing-- but, oh, how boring it is! In our family, we make up our own words to go along with the great pictures."
5,LOVE IT!,"I BOUGHT THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS BACK. I LIKED THE LOOK. SINCE THE DAY I RECEIVED IT....I HAVE GOTTEN SSSSOOOO MANY COMPLIMENTS AND PEOPLE STOPPING ME TO ENQUIRE WHERE I FOUND SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PENDANT. I BOUGHT ANOTHER FOR A GOOD FRIEND AND MONTHS LATER SHE SAID"" YOU KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE STOP ME TO ASK WHERE I GOT THIS"". ANOTHER DEAR FRIEND HAS ASKED ME THREE TIMES OVER THE PAST MONTHS. NEEDLESS TO SAY...I AM BACK BUYING ANOTHER ONE. THINKING OF GETTING AN EXTRA JUST IN CASE ANYTHING EVER HAPPENS TO MINE.IT IS A LOVELY PENDANT !!"
5,BEST PENDANT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND I REALLY MEAN IT!!!,This is my favorite pendant I have ever gotten. The only Con about it is it was a little smaller than I thought it would be but it is still cool. It comes in a nice black case also. From Ben Nelson (9 years old)
2,Myopia,"An interesting read - but just as ""facts"" here have been gathered and used to attack Clinton, so are ""facts"" used to attack George Bush, in another interesting read ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"".These books pander to the reader's existing belief. If you hated Clinton before, you'll consider yourself justifed now. If you hated Bush before, you'll have all the proof you need too. It's too bad that these unbalanced books pass in today's lazy society for analysis and critical thinking."
1,Just plain wrong,"Remember the Clinton years? How much happier we all were, how much more money we all had, the lack of stupid wars? The only thing wrong with Clinton's legacy is that it wasn't followed up by another moderate president with responsible policies."
1,short n sweet,A book composed exquisitely yet unmistakenly full of lies. I certainly would not recommend it.
1,Have one star reviewers read the book?,"I'm only giving one star now, because, frankly, I am trying to pose a question. I will rate the book when it arrives and I have a chance to read it.Honestly, have any of you 1 star reviewers read the book? All I get from you are defensive personal attacks on Lowry, or wild exaggerations of what you supposedly read. This isn't supposed to be an attack forum, and honestly, without providing any information about the book, you look like morons trying to castigate Lowry.Again, did you read the book? If so, what was your review? Thanks in advance."
1,Rush Limbaugh's Ghost Writer At It Again,"Typical neo-conservative hack job on Clinton that you would expect from any of the writer's probable idols, including Rush Limbaugh, Jerry Falwell and Sean Hannity. If you were to believe everything this guy says, then Clinton never would have made it out of the primaries let alone been elected President twice. Save your money! I only read this vile tripe because a neighbor didn't want it cluttering her library! If you must look for yourself, pull up a chair at Border's and read it for free with a nice latte'...just be sure to wash your hands after you put it back on the shelf (which shouldn't be long after you pick it up!)"
2,A well-documented and biased book,"Richard Lowry delivers a well-documented, but highly lopsided view of the Clintons. This is definitely not a book for the critical thinker, or for anyone who wishes to learn more about a brilliant, but unstable president who lacked confidence in his own convictions. Lowry does bring up a few interesting topics, such as Clinton's obsession with his legacy, along with his inability to truly face shaky foreign relations. However, it is too unfortunate when a good writer loses himself in the fissured psychodrama of American politics, which Lowry exhibits in this book."
1,"Change the name ""Clinton"" to ""Bush"" for an accurate book","You know why this book was published? Because now that it is obvious that Bush lied to this country and as a result more and more Americans are dying in Iraq each day, anybody with even the slightest intelligence will refuse to vote for Bush again for a 2nd term (please....he did enough damage in 1 term already. So Mr. Lowry simply is trying to make up fairty tales about one of the greatest presidents this country ever had in order to win more votes for Mr. Bush. Well, let me simply say this that Bill Clinton had practicaly freed this country of debt to foreign countries. Now, because of Bush's lies we are in debt billions of dollars for reparation. My generation is the one that will have to spend the rest of our lives paying it. That will really be ""paying the price for the Bush years"". True, Clinton did make some mistakes, but at least he did not leave a whopping number of American soldiers dead because of his lies."
5,Well Done and Must Reading,"Rich Lowry has done us all a great service. He has cutthrough all of the bull and provided fact after fact thatdismantel many of the lies pushed by Al Franken, Joe Conason, Eric Alterman, Michael Moore and othersof the simple minded set.This book is not a revenge driven book. As contrasted with the lies written by Franken, Moore, et.al., Lowry backs upeveryone of his points with hard facts. It is unfortunatethat the people who should really be reading this book willprobably never pick it up. That would require insight andthe ability to filter out banal prattle presented as actualuseful information.It is about time that someone wrote a book like this one.We have all been subjected to mindless ramblings for most of this year now and finally a well written response to theoffensive lies of the loony left has arrived."
2,The Bias opinion of the Clintons,This book has failed in many ways to represent the Clinton's and what they did for our country. It focuses on all the negative things and skips over details that are positive. Even though many of the things that are said in this book may be the truth they are not always the full truth. In conclusion I think the book misrepresented the Clintons and was bias towards the Republican point of view.
2,Devastated by passage of time,"Wow, what a difference five years makes.For all the flaws Lowry finds in Clinton (and there are several which bear noting), even the most serious pale to what we now find in the Executive Branch. If only we had a president who cared about his legacy enough to correct mistakes in judgement and reverse course when desperately needed. If only we had a president today who cared about polls, and the will of the people. If only we had a leader who acted cautiously, intellectually, and with the aid of evidence rather than ""gut feelings"".I remember well the days when I thought Clinton would be the worst president our country would ever see. How quaint those days seem."
1,sad,"having borrowed this book from a library, and not being able to finish it because it was so bad, I would just like to say that it is sad that conservatives still haven't gotten over the clinton years, especially when they chastise liberals to get over the stealing of the 2000 election."
1,Does he need a psychiatrist?,"I read about as much of this trash as I could stand. Thank God I didn't buy it! My real concern is how can anyone at this time talk about Clinton when we are now trillions of dollars in debt, are fighting Vietnam II and have had our civil rights stripped away? By the way, Korea, China, Russia, England, France, India, Pakistan, (I could go on and on) all have weapons of mass destruction. Let's go invade their country, Oh that's right they don't have the Oil that Iraq has, I forgot. If the Clinton years were hell then that's where I need to be. By the way did it even occur to the writer or the believers of his trash that 911 happened as soon as Bush came to office? Doesn't that tell you everything?"
1,Same old same old........same old.,"Whoops! Someone turned on the GOP food processor again, and out came the same old mush.Is it true Rich Lowry is actually Ann Coulter in drag?"
1,Nonsensical Trash,"After reading this diabolical book, I could not understand how somebody could write this trash and how a publisher could print this book. What a load of rubbish"
2,Fairly Unbalanced.,"While I may agree that Clinton did some harm to our country - i.e. the various world trade agreements, his DEA going after marijuana smokers, he is not as bad as Mr. Lowry paints in this book. But I suspect the book was not written with me in mind.As for Mr. Clinton's patriotism, Mr. Lowry should look in the mirror and ask him self why he has not served his country. While it is more difficult to be patriotic in uniform, it is also more honest. Mr. Lowry, it you are a true patriot, get thee to Iraq in a uniform then I will believe your patriotism. After all, your picture shows you to be young and in good health."
2,Up is Down and Down is Up,I'll give this book two stars. It gets one star just for laughs alone. This author's take on the economy is a masterpiece of proving that an obvious fact is not a fact. The 90's were an ecomonic disaster and this decade is nothing but roses I guess. He only proves that if you manipulate them enough you can make numbers say anything even if the conclusion is illogical.Anyone with an ounce of common sense and anything other than a totally closed mind should stay away from this book at least until if comes out in paperback then it will be a good beachbook. You know one of those comic fiction stories.
1,Not worth reading,"I would give this book zero stars if I could. Just another book throwing mud at the Clintons. Maybe Clinton could have spent time searching for Bin Laden if he hadn't been distracted by needless conservative attacks. Can you say impeachment? Lowry is this little twerp and I'd love to wipe the smirk off his face. The words in the book are really big so that even conservatives can read it. Bill Clinton was a great president and the radical conservatives just can't face it. Maybe Lowry's next book will be about Rush Limbaugh's drug addiction, George Bush's draft dodging, the missing and non-existant WMDs and other conservative hyprocasies. Those would be books worth reading."
1,Revisionist History,"Just keep blaming liberals, and maybe no one will notice we have given our country to BILLIONAIRES. You can now buy books blaming Clinton, JFK and Every other democrat for 911, how about you blame Little Bush's Pals.... SAUDI ARABIA, the people who did it!!!!!"
4,There is a lot to offer with this book.,"Even though there aren't many patterns available in this book, I found this book to be extremely helpful and pretty enjoyable to work with. The instructions very simple to follow and if you happen to run into a little trouble the pictures can be a great help. I recommend this book to intermediate crocheters only because the body is super simple to work up but the borders in this book can be a little tricky to complete. LOVE this book."
4,Different shade,"The only reason I gave this polish four stars instead of five, is because its a lot brighter in person-its still a pretty, light purple but the image here makes it look darker. I'm still excited to use it this summer!"
5,Capture any monent,"My previous camcorder broke and I waited awhile before buying a new one. I did some research and chose this camera. Its great, The best part is not having to squint into a tiny black and white hole when trying to record something. The camera offers lots of fun features that enable you to make interesting videos. A downside is it tends to be a bit bulky at times but I would rather take that over a bigger camera. And also the one touch LCD screen sometimes looks a bit dirty but only two faults after six months of great recording!"
4,First camcorder,"I bought this as my first camcorder a year ago, it is fun and easy to use. With in the first hour I was filming happily with great results. Just hook it up to the TV to watch on big screen and it's easy to record onto a VCR. Although adding sound on it is a little harder. The main problem I expierenced was holding steady at 16xzoom...but it works fine if I hold it against something, a railing or table top etc...Also the LCD screen is not protected and I was worried I'd damage it at first, but a year later and its still working fine after many hours hiking in the woods and riding in the skiff, so I guess it's a pretty hardy viewing screen. Also I bought a 3 hour battery, the batteries need to be completely drained to re-charge and that is a drag but...it's still wonderful and I am very happy with it! A great camcorder for the money."
4,Great Camera,"I didn't really need this camera, It's just another toy, but it is fun. Battery life is a little short and I could use a little work w/ steadiness, but other than that this camera is great."
2,Needs to be updated and reissued on DVD.,"When this collection first came out in 1999, it was also available on a single DVD-ROM, but I passed that over since I did not have a suitable drive at the time. But the multiple-disk nature of the CD-ROM set made it too clumsy to use regularly. The DVD-ROM version was obviously ahead of its time and was dropped for subsequent issues of the map collection.I call on National Geographic to reissue this collection, brought up-to-date and issued on DVD-ROM for Windows XP and newer operating systems!"
1,Operating system information,"This item only works on Windows 95, 98, ME or 2000. Very glad that I didn't open it and am returning it immediately. Other National Geographic software is PC and Mac and runs on current systems. This information should be listed in the item description. Unless you have an antique computer or an emulator DON'T BUY THIS!"
1,Bad News Maps,"This product should be taken off the market. It only works properly with ancient versions of Windows, and cannot be made to work with modern Windows."
4,Great Product,"Great product - has too many discs and is not easy to install so you can use it without having the discs. Our copy came with 2 of the same discs and as result was missing one. Had to wait a few days for replacement disc, but the manufacturer did send the replacement quickly."
2,Missing Hardware!,"I was pleased to receive my quick release bracket. When I opened the box there was NO HARDWARE!!! It clearly states that the hardware is included. This is a huge dissappointment. I am not one to write bad reviews, but when this has happened twice with marine sporting goods it is a hassle."
5,Amazing product,"This is by far the greatest skin cream I have used. It beats every other mainstream brand and isn't even super expensive. One of the best things is that it doesn't have a heavy, clinging fragrance. It is easily absorbed even though it's a cream and not a lotion, and is non greasy. It has a faint smell of almonds(which I love) since almond oil is one of the ingredients, but is not easily noticeable, in case that's not to your liking. I look forward to using this during the coming harsh winter."
5,Great way to make an extension for two subwoofer cables,I couldn't find a 35 foot long subwoofer cable to reach my second subwoofer on the opposite side of my home theater room so I purchased these female to female barrel connectors and put together a 25' and a 15' cable. The second subwoofer adds a lot to the sound and the gold plated connector made the connection for me.
5,I get compliments all the time,People ask me if its custom and how much it cost all the time. It is cool.
5,Unbeatable Wodehouse in great form,The Small Bachelor is the most funny non-Jeeves story I have ever read. I would give five times five stars If I could.
1,It wasn't even the right book!,"The picture said I ordered greek myths, the book i received was the wanderings of odysseus?? ok so maybe in the same ball park as the one i wanted but dang it!"
5,Fabulous,Came upon this book in a review for another book and checked it out. Wonderful. Some of the toughest books to read are described for smaller kids and make the world of Greek mythology understandable before venturing into the real books. So glad I found this and am planning to check out the author's other works for ids as well. Nice thick book wth pictures and a reading style that is as easy as kids mythology could be.
3,Not streak-less!,"They advertise that this glass cleaner is streakless but in fact, it leaves streaks and is only marginally better than any other glass cleaner in that respect. I do like that the smell of this glass cleaner is not repulsive and it contains no ammonia but I've had much better luck in terms of no streaks with this:T. R. Ind. NS-019 No Streek Glass Cleaner"
5,"Absolutely, positively the BEST glass cleaner","I hate cleaning windows. We have a very long enclosed porch with many glass windows.In my search for better glass cleaner I picked up a can of Sprayway at Walmart. It was cheaper than the big brands, in a retro looking spray can and was on the bottom shelf so I wasn't expecting much.WOW! THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!! This stuff actually makes cleaning windows FUN!I wipe it off with newspaper but paper towels or rags work great too.My wife actually had to yell at me to stop cleaning the windows and attend to other things on her honey do list. (I still snuck out to do my car windows-I couldn't help it!)I do like ""Invisible Glass"", found in the automotive department, for cleaning windows that have left over sticker gunk. It tends to work like Goof Off on glue and also does an OUTSTANDING job on glass.But the foam, low priced, Sprayway is my absolute favorite and I'll never buy another ""ammonia D"" glass cleaner again.Try this stuff, you will LOVE it!"
5,VERY GOOD PRODUCT,I USE IT FOR CLEAN ALL GLASS WINDOWS AND IT WORKS VERY WELL FOR ME THE BEST CLEANER BUT HARD TO FIND IT IN STORE THAT'S WHY I ORDERED IT ON AMAZONE BUT LATER I FOUND IT AT TARGET A LITTLE SMALLER BUT THE SAME PRODUCT.IT'S ONE OF PRODUCTS PROFESSIONEL USE A LOT.
3,vabgyard fc holder,Came just as I expected in great order and works good to keep my pictures safe at all times. I wisk I could afford to order another one soon. I would recommend this company to my friends and family.
5,"finally, a place for my stuff","I hate having to look for my CF cards when i want to go out shooting the wild life. I don't carry bullets, i use a camera, and i need a lot of space when i go out shooting. found this puppy today and i am sure i will enjoy it. I will probably even be needing a second one soon enough"
4,Good case,Great case but I only gave it a 4 because it is very hard to open. The SD cards do feel secure and they do not slip out when case is opened.
1,Software is buggy,"My daughter and I bought and tried to play this on Father's Day. Within minutes we found bugs with the software - lock-ups. Our PC is more than fast enough for the game. Very disappointing - and we can't, of course, return the game."
1,Do not waste your money.,"I bought this for my kids instead of getting Nintendogs since we have a computer and do not have a DS. The first time I installed it, it would lock up when you tried to train the dog. I searched the website and found that MAYBE I need to update my video driver (I have a pretty new computer). So I did that and reinstalled it. Still locked up. So I emailed the company (no phone support) and we waited the whole weekend to hear from them. Guess what...they told me to update my driver! So I messed around with it again and found that it locks up when you use the mouse and the space bar option instead of the 2 mouse button option (for training). Now that we had it working, my kids (8 and 10) played with it for about 45 minutes each and that's it! It's boring. Tamagotchis are WAY better! Spend your 15-20 bucks on one of them instead."
5,The best quantum introduction,"I've used the text as an introduction to quantum mechanics in electronic engineering and the results were great. The book is certainly concise, mathematical preliminaries are short and useful, and the approach is simple but the scope is important. It is very axiomatic and from a few principles I could solve the problems of the Schaum Edition devoted to Quantum Mechanics without reading the theoretical part. I've read several books introducing quantum mechanics, and I consider this was the best."
1,Never got the magazine,I paid over 260.00 dollars for this magazine subscription. The check was sent from Amazon to the publisher in England. The publisher in England has the magazine on hold and apparently never got the check Amazon sent. I was screwed around with for 2 months and the publisher in England never let this magazine company know what was going on. Very poor service on their part. I will never order another magazine from anywhere but the USA. Now I have to wait for a couple of billing cycles to get my money back. It's a lot of hassle for nothing. Never order magazines from another country whether you love them or not...
2,Didn't work for me,This product is probably fine for most people but I have very sensitive skin and I broke out after using this for a few days.
5,Makes you want to get up and go there.,"There are alot of tour books for this region, but this new one is really fun. There is lots of information on ""out of the way"" places and interesting festivals, all sorts of things which you wont find anywhere else. I love Provence, and this book will definately come with me the next time I go.The information is presented clearly and is well written, so it's easy to use. Lots of nice pictures, too. I like this guide alot, and I hope to see more French guides from this writer."
3,Back for another term,"I gave the previous Sony Broadway release 3 stars, saying:""The score by Berlin is pleasant enough, but lacks a really dynamic song or two. Robert Ryan was a fine actor but a poor singer and his ""It Gets Lonely in the White House"" is quite painful.The original LP was packaged in a gatefold jacket with 4 pages of notes and pictures inside. The cover was a foil-like material that glittered. It's not an essential cast album, and the show will never be revived, but it has enough of Berlin's old-fashioned melodies (and Nanette Fabray) to make it worthwhile.""Fabray's contributions add sparkle to the recirding: ""The First Lady"" and ""They Love Me"" are both great fun, as is Anita Gillette' ""The Secret Service (makes me Nervous.)""DRG deserves credit for giving collectors a chance to get this score without paying obscene prices."
4,Fun stuff,"I had forgotten what a fun score this is! Nothing out of this world, but pretty melodies and fun lyrics and rhymes (""The secret service ... makes me nervous ... "") by Irving Berlin. And to that you add the talents of Nanette Fabray and Anitta Gillette and you can just sit back and enjoy. I'm so glad I re-discovered it!!"
1,Mr President,"Knowing this was Irving Berlin's last musical, I was hoping to find some great melodies. What I really found was an old fashioned story accompanied by an uninspired score."
4,Wonderful Tweety Beach Towel,"This beach towel is VERY vivid, colorful and beautiful. I love it because I am a huge Tweety fan. I named my newest kitty Tweetheart (we already have a Sylvester cat) and that was before I saw this towel or ordered this towel. How cool is THAT? I do like beach towels that are larger than this one but this towel is by no means small. It is the standard size and fairly thick and plush. The shipper was fast and the order was accurate. Good job Amazon and good job seller. Fair price for the item."
5,Outstanding History,Roediger does a great job refrenceing his case in other historians. This is VERY importnat when discussing challenging topics like this.
4,As A Nursing Student.......,"This book really helped me in preparing my care plans for class. Not only does it have care plan information, it also has guides for tests such as the Mini-Mental. It really helped me out."
5,Another great CD with Brazilian influence,"Kevyn performs great on a set of songs influenced heavily on the Brazilian side:1. Another Season (a.k.a. ""Mangueira' originally written by Brazilian guitarist/singer Kleber Jorge, and here with English lyrics by Kevyn).6. Ella (a.k.a. ""Jogo de Cintura"" originally written by Brazilian maestro Dori Caymmi, and here with English lyrics by Kevyn).8. You Don't Love me Like You Used To (great batucada rhythm...)9. Colors of Joy (Original of Dori Caymmi)10. Retrato en Branco e Preto (original of Antonio Carlos Jobim).A great CD; worth collecting if you're a fan of Lettau and/or of Brazilian Jazz"
4,Happy to find locally,"I first became acquainted with Kevyn Lettau's music through one of the concerts at the World Trade Center. I fell in love with the cut, ""Morning Kisses"". I've attempted to find it before and only saw it offered internationally. I was so pleased to finally find it locally. Kevyn Lettau's music has a nice Brazilian sound, very relaxing. I liked a little more than half of the cuts, but the price more than made up for it. I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,A Mix Worthy of Praise,"Normally, I don't tend to pick up mixes when I can get the whole entire track and make my own mixes. Alas, every now and then, a mix comes along that makes you rediscover your own love for music. This is one of those mixes. Classic mix, as good as Julius Papp's ""Going Deep"" or Coldcut's JDJ mix.Of the two, my heart leans towards DJ Gregory's mix, which seems to stay closer to the theme of African-flavored house tracks than Bob Sinclair. Tracks 3 through 15 should have anyone with soul bopping heads and tapping feet. Bob Sinclair's mix is pretty damn solid, too, as he does a harder brand of house sprinkled with some percussions. Both mixes go through a range of tracks that go deep and go tribal.This is a keeper in my collection and a mix CD that alot of headz will sleep on."
5,excellent knife,"I've been using an Xacto handle with #11 blade for all my model building and this knife was recommended by a Swedish modeler.What a charm. Cuts perfectly and feels so much better in my hand than the old round handle. Just make sure to buy the Artist knife with the steep angled point, not the blunt one. And but replacement blades at the same time."
5,so many ways so fine,"Simic is always fine. A poet of atmosphere, evocative, palpable images. A poet of situation and irony with a finely honed sense of the language."
1,Side straps too short for me,Side straps were too short for me. Everything else was okay. Like to do this the weight but side straps too short
2,Gross,"When the product shipped to me, it was in a dusty gross camera bag with sticky stuff on it and dog or cat hair. I cleaned it up, but the camera was all scratched up and nasty as well. NOT happy, but at least the thing works."
1,Sharp is dull,Purchased this camcorder in September and have not been able to get the software or cable necessary to transfer images to the computer. Sharp says it's the only manufacturer with the necessary software/cables. Sharp now says the camcorder is outdated and the software/cable is on backorder for over 350 people! I will never buy anything from Sharp again.
3,expensive to drop,"love the camera, just don't drop it - expect to replace, not repair. costs the same."
1,The roots of STINK,"Not only is BIG BAND LEADERS * THE ROOTS OF SWING stereo re-recordings of great old big band tunes, but the musicians on this unfortunate CD sound as if they've either lost their playing abilities or never had them to begin with. I haven't seen so many clams since the last time I was at Howard Johnson's. All songs here are in the key of D minus.This LEGACY (take note of that label) ""product"" has succeeded in destroying the real legacy of a fine music form. Shrill, harsh, pathetic and other such adjectives don't begin to describe the disaster that is THE ROOTS OF SWING - it should be avoided by all but the most serious of masochists. Feh."
5,I'm Lovin' It,"I don't understand why amplifier manufacturers don't supply these with your purchase. The back of my amplifier looks so clean and organized now. Before, speaker wires used to extend at an angle. If I had to reconnect them for any reason, I had to strategize which ones I had to disconnect first in order to reach my desired wire. And of course, I had to be careful that the wire's end didn't splay apart and touch other terminals. An annoyance I'm sure most of you have felt. Now, connecting and disconnecting is basically a matter of plug and play.These are great! Easy to use. You just put one end of a spliced wire into the inside of the plug. Screw the top on and you're done. And the best part... They're reuseable. Take the top off and start over if needed. I highly recommend them."
5,Reminder,I have been reading this book for years and it isa good reminder of the necessary steps we need to take to improve our life and the world
3,This lotion worked well. It's a little greasy ...,"This lotion worked well. It's a little greasy feeling, but overall it did the job. It's a bit pricey and I really couldn't see much difference in this compared with other less expensive brands. I have severe dry skin and I would recommend Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream over the lotion. It's worth the higher price."
4,"When first using the produce, my skin felt ...","When first using the produce, my skin felt wet. But that became a minor thing when for the rest of the day, my dry skin was not dry. The product didn't get a really good Test Drive though because the weather didn't get cold. My skin is awful in cold weather and the weather here stayed in the 60's and up. My dry skin friends will be told all about this product. I will probably buy it again."
3,I have extremely dry skin and have tried ...,"I have extremely dry skin and have tried many different lotions. I've been applying the Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion three to four times a day for the past week. I like the ease of use the pump offers over creams in a jar. Also the lotion absorbs into my skin more quickly than a heavy cream does. This lotion does make my hands feel particularly nice and soft after use. The redness is also lessened after use. However, its effects don't seem to last very long. My hands appear visibly dry and cracked within a few hours again, and I have to reapply the lotion. Also, I'd like a mild fragrance since I don't use perfume or scented powder. I've found having a lotion with a mild scent just makes me feel good. Overall, I'd recommend this lotion for someone who doesn't have extremely dry skin. It does make your skin feel very nice after you apply it. Also, if you like fragrance-free products this may be the perfect moisturizer for you."
2,Too Greasy,"I first tried this lotion when staying with my aunt, she had horrible acne and used this as a face moisturizer. It feels greasy when you first put it on, but leaves your skin very soft. I do not use it on my own face, but works great on my legs and hands. I do not recommend this product for it's price though, you can find something just as good for way less."
2,"Okay, but can't compare to Nutraderm","I began using this earlier this year when I discovered that my local CVS had discontinued carrying Nutraderm's Advanced Formula Therapeutic Lotion, which is the improved version of the facial moisturizer recommended to me by my dermatologist over 15 years ago & which I have used consistently & happily for all that time. The quality of Cetaphil's lotion, although almost identically priced, isn't even remotely close to Nutraderm's. The Cetaphil lotion is heavy, greasy & stings. It sits on top of my skin & makes it feel oily for hours. It also affects my foundation adversely. I just found out that Amazon also carries the Nutraderm, so I purchsed two 16 oz bottle for less than $10 & tossed the bottle of Cetaphil, even though close to 12 oz were left. Couldn't be happier to have my Nurtaderm back. If you're interested, I've posted a review of Nutraderm separately."
5,I have really dry skin and the Cetaphil ...,"I have really dry skin and the Cetaphil Lotion worked wonders for me. No more dry, scaly patches for me -- now I have nice smooth skin. I have been using Vaseline Intensive Care and the Cetaphil Lotion worked so much better. After I put in on my feet, I put on a pair of socks and in the morning my feet were as soft as my 2-year-olds."
4,The lotion was healing for my family's dry ...,"The lotion was healing for my family's dry and cracked skin that's part of life in the high altitude climate where we live. After using the lotion, my skin was still soft and smooth the next morning unlike other lotions I've tried. Before trying Cetaphil, I used Lubriderm and drugstore brand equivalents but now would buy this product instead."
4,I enjoyed using this lotion. I have had ...,"I enjoyed using this lotion. I have had some patches of dry skin, and it helped within one day! I had a cold, and the skin around my nose was irritated from repeated blowing. The lotion helped soothe and heal this almost immediately. The lotion I usually use hadn't helped, but the Cetaphil took care of the problem the first time I used it! I'd definitely recommend this to my family and friends."
4,I'd recommend this product to family and friends. ...,"I'd recommend this product to family and friends. It has a wonderful texture, though a little greasy at first. Leaves hands soft and looking great. I wash a lot of dishes at my business and use this lotion afterwards. My hands aren't dry anymore. No fragrance makes this a wonderful product for people with allergies."
5,Best Calibretto Yet!!,"Now this is the one of the best cds I have. The lyrics and intrumentals are great! The best part fo the whole cd is the lyrics, they are so good and harsh, about how screwed up the world is. The instrumentals are great, the folk rock really makes them unike and quality. The harmonica also helps the music. This is one of the best bands and cds ever. Along with Project 86, Five Iron Frenzy, and Incubus.Go to ... thanks yall, buy it NOW!!"
5,Large Splitter But Liked The Build Quality,"It is big but I liked the heft of this splitter. I esp. like the large signal range the splitter handles. For those of you who may not know, older pre-HDTV splitters may cause choppy HDTV signals, as they will accidentally cut-off the signal that HDTV uses but still allow standard television signals to come through just fine. This splitter should not have that issue."
5,"Acoustic Research PR430 High Performance 2 GHZ, 2-way splitter","What's not to like--the price was right, the product was great, they shipped it almost as fast as I ordered it. I would highly recommend this product."
1,signal quality no better than $2 splitter,I bought this splitter because I was having problems with low signal quality after a split on my digital cable. So I replaced my inexpensive splitter with this fancy shmancy one and..... the picture got much much worse so now I'm out twelve bucks.
5,A Gem- And Not Just for Therapists!,"This little treasure is loaded with wisdom and insights one might expect to find in a much larger tome. Dr. Pipher shares her personal and clinical stories in a gentle friendly way that makes you nod your head, and say ""aha"".What makes this book so remarkable is that, whether one is a therapist or not, the words spill over and warm you like a down comforter.Pour yourself some hot cocoa, take a deep breath, and read this one slowly. You'll be glad you did.-Terry Matlen, ACSW"
3,Interesting,Interesting to read with some practical advice. Mostly philosophical musings on the nature of the profession. Artfully written and prosaic.
4,Great value,"I saw Paula Begoun on Oprah who recommended this product. It is a very good product for a very reasonable price. After 1 month of use twice a day, my face had fewer breakouts and is much quicker to recover when I do have a breakout. My skin feels somewhat smoother also. The lotion slightly tingles but is not uncomfortable. I will try the wash next."
3,I don't like the smell,"I'm a guy and wanted some face lotion but didn't want to spend a bunch of money. This had good reviews and anti-aging is a good idea. It may be a great product I really wouldn't know the difference, I give it a 3/5 because I really don't like the smell. Its not terrible but it bothers me to the point that I don't like using it."
4,Seems to be working,"This product seems to be making my fine lines fade. I only use it around my eyes and sometimes my forehead on the horizontal creases. I have used it almost nightly for about a month, and even though my sleeping has been less than desirable, my fine lines are definetly minimized. I am using this as a preventive measure (I am only 24 years old) so not sure how it would work on more mature skin. My one criticism is that it also seems to dry my face out slightly. This product is very potent with Alpha Hydroxy Acids(10%) which can cause irritation, photo-sensitivity and flaking. Research has shown that AHA can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but there is little evidence to suggest long-term efficacy."
5,WOnderful product,"I used this a few years ago but for some unknown reason stopped?? I think I was trying other skin products. Also, it is difficult to find in local drug stores and other stores. Anyway, I have rediscovered it!! my skin feels smooth and fresh, so happy I found it again. Where else??? Amazon.com - I find I am making almost ALL of my purchases here - great prices - great selection...."
5,2nd time buying,"I like this moisturizer, this is my 2nd time purchasing. I feel it has greatly improved the texture of my skin. The first bottle I used all over, this second bottle I am using on my face and I purchased the silk body wrap lotion for my body."
4,Love it!,"I use this product as a substitute for body lotion. Apply two days in a row, then rest for one day. Very soon you will see the difference on your skin. The keratosis will be cure as well if you have the patience. Use sunblock, very important."
4,Nice product,Haven't seen any major change so far. Have been using it for a week or so. But somehow I'm still quite confident that it will work. Very reasonable price too!
1,Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion,"This is not working for me I bought five of this I taught Its a good bargain when its on sale..... But it gotten worst when I tried it, gave me more pimples I gave it a try for 2 weeks but my face became worst I don't recommend this.... at all."
2,Horrible shipping=product doesn't work,"When the product arrived, the package was completely mangled. As I opened the package, one of the bottles of AHA was opened and some had squirted onto the packaging. The product itself does not seem to work. I do not get a ""stinging"" as described by other users of AHA when the lotion is applied, and it does not have a ""strange"" smell as other users had described. It just seems like plain lotion. It had no effect for me or my son. I am considering buying it again but from another dealer."
5,Great Stuff,"I've used a lot of products, professional, cheap, expensive and this stuff does the trick. Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne."
2,Acne Inducing on face,"This product didn't say whether it could or could not be used on the face, however, I chose to use it on the face because the active ingredient was Glycolic-AHA. It broke me out on the forehead and scattered acne on my cheeks and jawline. I recommend acne.org's AHA lotion. I've been using ACNE.ORG's skin line for a year and they have an AHA lotion along with acne care and it works amazingly. I actually had to go back to it and it cleared my acne up again."
5,This lotion helps with Keratosis Pilaris skin issues!! ;-),"Omg this lotion has helped my Keratosis pilaris skin condition! It has helped smooth out my skin and reduce the ""chicken skin"" look on my arms and legs. I am extremely happy with the smooth feeling skin and the reducing of the dark marks on my skin. I wish I had used this long before now. I still have a few bumps pop up from time to time...but it is dramatically reduced. I use it twice a day...morning and night. I hope it keeps helping! :-D"
3,too strong for me!!,"I thought this would be a great product for me because I wanted to get rid of my acne scars. I'm 21 and I don't have sensitive skin, but the product stung like hell each time I used it. After about 2 weeks of constant applications, some of my scars did fade. So I'm not saying the product didn't work, but it might not be made for a younger person's skin."
4,Good exfoliator!,"This product is highly recommended on a popular TV show and after using it for months, I agree. It smooths and exfoliates with a higher glycolic content than most over the counter alpha hydrox products. The price is right, too. I use it nightly."
4,Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion works best for me!,"I have tried many different types of lotion and moisturizers, and Alpha Hydrox works best for me. My problem is dry, flaking skin. Alpha Hydrox moisturizes and exfoliates at the same time! Nothing else I have tried has made my skin clear and healthy like Alpha Hydrox. I have no association with this product or this company, except as a satisfied customer! I have been using Alpha Hydrox for years, and although I have tried many other products - I always come back to this one."
5,Great Product,"I'm ordering this for the 3rd time. I've used it for about a year and it really helps. I'm 56, a natural redhead, with deep wrinkles and age spots on my face. It has softend the depth of a lot of my wrinkles, and faded my darkest age spots.They're not gone completely, but definitely less noticeable. My skin tone is much more even. I use it morning and night. My skin is very sensitive and every other AHA lotion I've used has caused breakouts. I get none with this stuff. My skin is very dry however and after letting this absorb for 5-10 minutes, I use Cetaphil moisturizer... cream at night and the lighter Cetaphil lotion in the morning. Very happy with this product, which is 1/2 the price of drug store stuff and 1/4 the price of department store stuff with all it's fancy advertising."
1,didnt work,"The product feels smooth on skin for only a short period. I havent noticed any difference in my skin. I used to use clinique product before and switched to this one but no results so far. The worst part is it stings every time you use it for a short period. I get itchy feeling soon after i put on my face. I use only at night as, people have been complaining about skin burn. However, it is just $10 so try it and maybe it will work for you."
4,Very nice!,I really like this lotion! I have minor acne scars and this slowly lightens them away :) It a also improves the texture of stretch marks. I've only been using it for a couple weeks but I see a huge improvement.
4,Seems to work fine for me???,"I downloaded the trial version from their website and it seems pretty straight forward. I am not savvy at all about ripping DVD's or anything but it loaded a DVD to my PSP and music from my iTunes library into the vault, then to my PSP...it all worked great... You have to have the free software you can get from a simple Google search to break the copyright stuff on the DVD's but that was easy to get as well.So, not sure why everyone thinks this software sucks so bad. Based on the other reviews I wasn't going to buy it, but since they had the free trial version I gave it a shot...and I am happy with it so far...It took a little while to download the DVD to my hard drive and then to my PSP, but I think that's mostly my old cruddy DVD read/writer on my comp than anything..."
1,Bamboo - World Class Bad,"I got Bamboo Vault360 to transfer my personal DVD collention to my new, fabulous, Creative Zen W. In agreement with the other reviewer for this program, I was 100% disappointed and wish I could get my money back. Attempted to use it once, then went for Zilisofts' DVD Ripper Platinum that does everything I need, with none of Bamboos bizarre interface (totally ineffective). With this product I really felt I was $49.99 in the hole for something I would never use again.Note: Does not rip copy protected DVDs. Given that most people are moving their own DVD media to their own PMP's this is a massive product failure. I didn't have a single DVD I could rip to my Creative Zen W with Bamboos Vault360."
1,Totally useless piece of software! Don't waste your money!,"We purchased the Vault360 software to use in place of iTunes, as we don't like the limitations of iTunes. Vault360 promised to enable us to transfer music and video files to and from our iPods, as well as convert the music files from our CD collection to MP3 format. We installed the software--and we can't even get it to properly connect to either of our iPods. It detects the devices and recognizes them, but then we get an error message stating that it is having trouble ""connecting with the device."" It then tells us if this is the first time we're transferring photos to our iPods to use iTunes first and then return to Vault360 and it will work. Well, we're not transferring photos at all, so this won't do us any good. I looked at the User Guide online but it was useless as well.This program was a complete waste of money and I would NEVER recommend it to anyone! If I could give it zero starts, I would."
2,Wrong Product sent by BestSource Office Supply,"Two MontBlanc rollerball refills were delivered on time, but were the wrong refills (different product code, black ink rather than blue ink). Good price and 2-day delivery, however!"
1,NO TV reception,This is not really a portable TV because it has no TV antenna. It is made to be connected to an antenna source - like cable. I tried buying a TV antenna but the rabbit ears it needs are nearly as big as the unit which means I no longer have a portable unit that can be carried in one hand - I really wish it came with a TV antenna - I do not understand what the manufacturer was thinking! I won't buy Memorex again.
1,Worthless TV,"This is without a doubt the most worthless and useless TV I have ever seen. Reception is horrible without an antenna, which is impossible to find even with the help of the Memorex customer service people. Memorex will never be an option when I make my future electronics purchases."
4,Grammy Screws Up Again (But Not With Their Selections),"This is a very good CD with a great variation of styles and good music. The best tracks (in my opinion) include Radiohead, U2, and Macy Gray. But the Grammy's did mess up royally in one aspect. The version of Eminem's ""The Real Slim Shady"" is the radio edited version. I don't understand how you can honor someone's music by garnering them with a nomination, and then proceed to censor the same honored music. Ridiculous, if you ask me."
2,Save your money and listen to the radio,"Should have called this ""Best of Bubblegum 2001"". Do we really need more Bye Bye Bye or What A Girl Wants? There are a few respectable tracks (Aimee Mann, U2, Beck, Joni Mitchell and Steely Dan) but where are Shelby Lynne, Bela Fleck, North Mississippi Allstars, Dolly Parton and Steve Earle? There were some great artists nominated that you DON'T hear on the radio 50 times a day. Would've been nice to give them some exposure."
2,Decent CD,Took me back in time but didn't like too many of the songs. Bought this because I wanted the complete set. Hope the rest are better. Good sound quality. Arrived unbroken which was a definite plus.
1,I made my own version of the Grammy Nominees 2001 before,"Because of me there are now two Grammy Nominees 2001 CDs, the one I made and this one. But the songs on my version of the CD are totally different from this one. You are very, very likely to get the authorized version. Amazon.com listed the songs from this CD but I'll show you a list of the songs from my CD:1. I Try 2. Shape Of My Heart 3. Doesn't Really Matter 4. Lucky 5. This Kiss 6. I Turn To You 7. Bye Bye Bye 8. This Time Around 9. Kryptonite 10. Never Let You Go 11. Heartbreak Hotel 12. I Knew I Loved You 13. I'll Be Your Everything""I Try"" and ""Bye Bye Bye"" are the only two songs featured on both CDs."
1,the point?,"The only purpose this CD can really serve well is to provide yet another ""various artists"" compilation for those who listen to music in a ""top 40"" style. True fans of most all of these bands would buy the real albums of the artists they enjoy. But hey, the people who run the Grammys deserve to have a little bit fatter wallets on behalf of the former, the... hmm, ""artfully-challenged"" generation who will no doubt eat it up.If you are buying this CD as a true representation of this year's Grammy awards, you should know that this CD (as you can probably see) is tipped towards the big pop artists (n'sync, b.b., britney, christina). Yet the awards spoke somewhat... differently. Now That's What I Call Annoying 1!"
4,Ovall-pretty good,Great variety of songs from 2001...there are 6 tracks that I wasn't familiar with: (#6/8/9/10/12/13) or liked very much. I would much rather purchase a Various artist CD than to drop a lot of money buying individual artist's CD unless I am a big fan of the singer and have a good feeling that the CD I am purchasing is one that I will like. Take a Chance and enjoy the music from 2001!!!
3,"The songs are good, but quality,","One or two songs (6, 8) have some problem when playback. I am not sure if my copy is not good or something. The overall quality and song selection is good."
1,Some of these bands just don't belong,"When I think of 2001 pop music, i think of ... music where musicians not only not write their own music, they don't perform it either. Songwriting is key in music, its the basis of all emotions within music. Boy bands and these teeny boppers aren't music. Its a shame that bands like U2, Radiohead, Paul Simon and Beck have to be linked with such disgusting musicians as Nsync, Backstreet Boys, Christina Aguilara, Brittney Spears and Destiny's child. I have to give this album 1 star because it contains more than one song from teeny boppers. The great thing about the 60's was not only that the music was great, the good music was popular. Now, a lot of kids my age (16) don't know of Bob Marley, The Grateful Dead, or even Jimi Hendrix. It's a shame that pop music could be so terrible. Peace and love."
2,Radiohead was robbed...,"A pretty pathetic CD. It is slanted towards all of the pop crap that is playing today. One of the few gems on it is ""Optimistic"" by Radiohead. Undeniably the greatest band in the world, at the moment, full of energy and creativity(something mainstream pop music lacks). I read one of the other reviews of this CD calling ""Optimistic"" pure junk. Well, you're an idiot and probably like all of the pop songs, you jackass. This song was all over the radio and it hit the top 10. The album it came from debuted at No. 1 and how many albums can you say do that. Their next album, Amnesiac, hits stores June 6. Pick it up because it will be a return to the days of The Bends and OK Computer. Screw all of you Radiohead bashers. Go back to your pop crap ans stay away from the mind expanding music of Radiohead."
4,Freaks and Fire: The Underground Reinvention of Circus,"Gorgeous cover and the hand-designed letterpress titlepages are fantastic, but I thought there would be more color photography. There are several spreads on nice big color images but most photography in the book is black and white. Definitely an interesting read though, and looks great on a coffee table. I bought this for a friend who's a Burning Man enthusiast and he was pleased with it. Props to Phil, Jeff, and Casey!"
2,microphone not working,"Good headset, but the microphone does not work at all, already bough two of this item, both times the detachable microphone did not work, even when plugged directly into the audio input.Note: have only tested on macs, but don't see why it should work on a pc."
1,2 week lifespan,"I bought this about 2 weeks ago (maybe less) for around $25.00 at Target. And this morning, it just decided to stop working altogether. I don't recommend this thing at all. Especially since it'll break by just sitting on your desk overnight."
3,Handy headset,"This headset was a bargain and works beautifully BUT it smells like funky artificial plastic chemical... not sure how to describe it. I've had it for months now and the smell is still there. Every time I use it, I feel like the headset gave me cancer b/c of the nasty chemical smell (knock on wood this is not true).If it didn't smell so bad, I'd give it 5 stars. The detachable mic and included mic stand is pretty neat (had no idea it would come with it when I ordered)."
2,These are not a good buy...,"I got these LCD protectors for my new camera. I was excited when they came in the mail as I have protectors on both my ipod and cell. These were not so good. They put little stickers saying which side to open first on each protector that are impossible to remove neatly. You know those stickers that you just have to scrub and scrub to get all the gooey stuff off? Well this is it... they did not remove. I tried all 3 protectors to try and get one just looking good. IT did not work. If I were to use one of these protectors on my camera, I would be looking into gooey remainder of sticky everytime I want to take a picture. Let me know if anyone knows of good LCD protectors for a 2.5 screen please! I would stay away from these!"
3,ideas,Tons of great ideas but the problem is that I haven't looked at it once since I read it. Would be better if there were great color photos in it.
4,Best Blackhead Remover,"I have tried many things (special creams, washes, and contraptions) to remove the blackheads on my nose. These are by far the best. You can see results the first time you use them, and after a a month or so, I had no more blackheads on my nose, which is a big feat considering I have had very stubborn blackheads on my nose for years."
3,The deep cleaning nose pore strips do remove ...,"The deep cleaning nose pore strips do remove many imperfections from the skin's surface. Upon removal, the surface of my skin does appear cleaner and the pores seem to be minimized. I would recommend this product to others."
4,I have been wanting to try this item ...,"I have been wanting to try this item for a while and was skeptical about how useful it actually would be. I was surprised to find that it actually seems to work. I don't know if it really helped prevent clogged pores, but the instant results seemed to prove that it does clean skin and pores. I'd have to use them over a prolonged period to see how effective they are over the long run."
3,This product is a neat idea but not ...,"This product is a neat idea but not for me. I used it twice and both times it did not significantly """"clean"""" my pores over the whole area of the strips (but did work well on the sides). Perhaps it would work better with different shaped noses! Also, it really HURT taking off the strip after it had dried. My pores didn't appear to look any different after using this product so I probably won't purchase it again."
2,So Much for Trask Quality,I bought these sandals for a much anticipated vacation. Final cost including shipping - $146.88.About two hours after I put them on for the first time the elastic strap holding the top to the side of the left shoe broke loose making it unwearable. I went to a nearby tourist trap and paid $12.00 for another pair of sandals to get me though my vacation.I will try to put the Trask shoes back together with super glue when I have time. They appear to be well made other than this flaw.I will post a photo showing the damaged shoe in customer images.
2,YouTube,"Really? I can't believe what I paid for a 14 minute video of a pre-recorded TV show. They charged close to $18 bucks for this?Geeeesh. He's a geek. And a poker faced one at that. Yes he's rich now but based on a few facts in this video he's not necessarily ready for prime time.Buy it if you can justify the price, but you can probably find it on utube."
5,Wow!,"I listened to this book, probably enhancing its appeal. Good reader--I thought Australian accent. Loved, loved the characters and the author's unusual way of evoking reality for his reader. I want the Courtenay books on Kindle, please!"
3,Ok,"Got here ok, though it took a while longer than some orders. Binding was very loose, but readable. Would have liked a bit tighter copy."
5,Saved,"I checked out practically every jewlery store in San Antonio looking for a ""stocking stuffer"" for my wife. One of my daughters suggested I check out Amazon. I did, and found the perfect set of amethyst clip-on earrings at a more-than-reasonable price. My wife loves them and her friends admire them. Thanks!"
3,Performs as advertized,This does gives me a better grip and the wiimote looks cool too! I would not buy this today as Nintendo is giving away free wii jackets that had some padding at the edges - great if you keep hitting your opponent accidentally!
4,Great float!,This is a great float. Dries fast and supports people of a broad range in weight and height. It supports me or my husband no problem. Even allows for our 3 year old to sit with us on the float and not sink. Very durable.
5,"Bruno Pelletier, keep on singing!","I have been a huge fan of Bruno Pelletier since I first heard his voice in the wonderful musical, ""Notre Dame de Paris"". His voice, by far, is one of the greatest voices I have ever heard. It is so strong and full of passion that you can't help but love what you're hearing.The album begins with ""Je Crois Pourtant"" and it has a great rock feel to it. ""Ma Jalousie"" is the next song, which was the first song I heard from the album. ""Madeline"" is a lovely song that sounds like a lullaby. ""Toujours et Maintenent"" is one of my favorite songs on the cd. One of the most emotional songs on the cd is, ""Le Clown"". It's quite sad when you read the translation. I have been listening to this cd non-stop these past few months, and I'm still not sick of it.A Monde a L'Envers is a great cd that I would recommend to anyone, French speaking or not, who enjoys good music. Bruno Pelletier needs to keep on making cd's and I will be buying them forever!"
2,"nice, but not at this price","When i purchased this model of sub, i expected it to be the perfect completion of my long in the building system. It replaced an itty bitty aiwa sub. I was rather disapointed when I found the new sub preformed hardly better than my old. Overall it was a good sub, nd handled higher volumes with decent response, but I paid significantly lower, and still feel it was overpriced"
4,"Good for the money, but not great speakers","I wanted an inexpensive set of speakers to put in my kitchen and purchased these. They are just fine for that. But I tested them against my living room speakers, which are substantially more expensive, and they are simply not as good.When I flipped the switch to change to the Wharfedales, my wife said that it sounded as if I turned the treble all the way up and the bass all the way down.Few people can really judge unless they can compare two or more different speakers at the same time. You get what you pay for."
1,Assembly quality poor at best,"Received my Wharfedale 7.2's - major disappointment! One of the speakers looked as if it was a puzzle; the speaker wasn't connected to the speaker box, and the wires weren't connected to the speaker either. The other speaker was fine. Of course, the Wharfedale ""Quality Assured"" seal was affixed to the side of the box, making me wonder just what their ""Tested to Specifications"" included - obviously it didn't involve even a visual review of the product before it went out the door. Another disappointment - the box Amazon sent the speakers in was poorly closed."
5,7.2's will get the job done !,"The sound from these speakers is very clean. I use them as rear channel speakers on my surround system. The 89db rating seems to be on the mark as the sound level sparks your listening pleasure. At this price, you just can not pass them up.Some recommend augmenting these with a sub woofer. I will try this soon. Even without, the bass response is very smooth.Enjoy!"
5,Wow,These are great speakers! I rate products I buy on quality etc. as well at price. These babys bring the best from both worlds. They have a superb sound that will please any music lover. From piercing highs to bone crunching lows and everything in between. Its perfect! Godly! Without distortion! You should of seen the smile on my face when I hooked them up. Buy these!
1,don't waste your money,"This book is a joke, at least relative to what I was expecting. With it's title, I was shocked to discover that it was written/published in 2002 (my bad for not checking before purchasing), so it really does not discuss anything relevant to current trends in social networking, video sharing, etc. It simply speculates about the post crash Internet world. It is written in 14 point font with double spacing, making the 200 pages really more like 75. For $44.95 I was expecting a serious work on the state of web 2.0. This book is very dated and priced 5x what it's worth."
5,Possibly the most sensible book to come about the net.,I think the title of this book really encapsulates what the author is trying to say. The content is precise and delivered in a cogent and crystal clear manner. McCormack is candidly honest about where the net is going and his perspicacity is incisive. There has been so much written about the new economy that is faux-directed and trite. I think this book is a necessary read for anyone who intends to use the net for anything to do with their business.
3,Another average hardy boys book.,"Sabotage at sea is enjoyable, with fast-paced action and mystery. I recommend this for any fan of the series. But if you haven't read any Hardy Boys books, I suggest starting with the first book of the series."
2,Not much weird here,The record starts off in the right direction but after the first song it becomes a dance club album.Song after song of rave type stuff.Three good songs are all you get.Sorry long time fans.
5,I'm biased so my opinion might not count,I get really sick of people who act like the Surfers are some inside joke only accessible to the ultra in-the-know crowd. They are and have always been a group with highly eclectic tastes and a warped sense of humor who make interesting and kick ass music. This album is a great example of their work and evolution as artists.
1,Ah man what a crock,"Apparently having a radio hit was the worst thing that ever could have happened to the BH, because everything on this CD reeks of 'Pepper,' which wasn't a very good song in the first place. I think these guys just finally got old and ran out of ideas. Five years and this is all they came up with? Being involved in lawsuits and contracts must have made them stale or something. This is really bad music.They're just trying way too hard to make everyone like them, which is exactly what Locust Abortion Tech and Rembrandt Pussyhorse tried not to do. Maybe they're just cashing in on their ""fanbase"" and hitting the right marketing demographic to maximize their chart listing position.One way or the other, it's all over."
1,worse than electric larry land a new low,I lOOOve the Butthole surfers.Now i have paid for that love with the waste of my hard earned money on this ... this is a dance record and a dull dance record at that. they just are not trying.i just cant wash the stink of this cd out of my head.
5,This is a Great Record!!!!!,Any true fan of the surfers could see this was the way they were headed. If you stop trying to compare it to old Surfer records you would hear a genuinely unique and great record. With Butthole Surfers written all over it.
3,Butthole Surfers - 'Weird Revolution' (Hollywood),"Not as good as 'Electriclarryland'(see my review),but still a decent effort by the Surfers.On 'Weird...',I thought the guys did pretty much what they've been known for,fusing noisy psych with alternative metal like so few bands can.Seems like about every other cut here rocks,like the title track ""Weird Revolution"",""Dracula From Houston"",Get Down"" and so on.Worthy of SOME repeated plays.Check it out."
3,Some great songs and some other tracks,"Butthole Surfers has never been a favorite band of mine. I love their hit Pepper, but had not heard anything else of theirs until The Shame of Life popped up on my Pandora station. It's a fantastic song with strange interesting lyrics and catchy music. I bought this album on the strength of it and was disappointed with almost every other song, Dracula from Houston being the notable exception. Many of the tracks don't have what I would call singing on them, some spoken word or screaming. And the lyrics and music for the rest of the tracks just don't pull together. They are pushing the bounds of conventional music, but seem to have lost sight of what is actually enjoyable to listen to."
4,weird,"This CD gives just what it promised weirdness. I think its a great CD but its not the best of the butthole surfers. If you are new to this group stick to there other stuff like ""hairway to steven"" but if your looking for something nice and weird and fun this is a good choice"
2,They're just not trying.,"I'm all for bands trying out new styles. No one should steadfastly stick to a single sound for their entire career, and the Buttholes know this. So the 90s were their experimental period -- that's okay. But even though INDEPENDENT WORM SALOON and ELECTRICLARRYLAND (their last two albums) had parts that didn't work, it was clear that the band's heart was in the right place.Right now, the band's heart is in a bank vault somewhere.That's the problem with WEIRD REVOLUTION. It sounds very, very uninspired. I have no problem with the Surfers deciding to do an electronic album -- hell, they already did, under the name The Jack Officers -- but any style they tackle without 100% effort is going to go to waste. These songs sound like they were written in the space of an afternoon. And for the people who brought you LOCUST ABORTION TECHNICIAN -- quite possibly the most inspired piece of lunacy ever sold commercially -- less than 100% just isn't enough."
4,Butthole Surfers Age and Mature,"I really liked this album with one exception...Paul Leary although producing it, he forgot to include himself in the musical mix. The album is sorely missing Paul's searing guitar work! With that said, I still love this album. All bands grow, mature, and evolve. The BHS's have evolved into a more rich, textured sound, with loops and sound effects. Close comparison would be similar to the Revolting Cocks. I'm thrilled that they are still around and looking foward to seeing them live. If your not hung up on thier earlier sounds and can get by thier mature sound, then buy this album. It's different than other alternative sounds out there."
1,It's like watching a close pet get old and die.,"I followed them through all of their albums, eating them up with pleasure and greed. BHS were a VERY important band to me. Even Larryland with Pepper kept me with them. And then this sad album was squeezed out after too much wait. It makes me sick from start to finish. A boring techno whimper to end a long amazing career."
2,The best part is the cover,"Although I've been a long-time fan of this truly original band, I can't recommend this latest release. The opening track is a promising mock-rap/groove, about the joys of being a misfit. Then the rest of the album contradicts it, by being a boring, repetitive collection of dance tracks. This is a far cry from the freaked-out brilliance of a classic Surfers' album such as Locust Abortion Technician or Psychic, Powerless..., and only The Last Astronaut stands out as being a truly twisted and disturbing song, and the only one that resembles vintage-Surfers.The cover art is great, but misleading, as is the title, because this half-hearted effort by a once-wonderful band is anything but weird."
2,Disappointment,"I love the Butthole Surfers. I hate this album. It has almost no personality and every song sounds like a cynical attempt at radio airplay. Just because they had a freak hit with ""Pepper"", there is no need to put out a whole album of similar songs.Even the packaging and website associated with this album are bland and tasteless. Please come back Buttholes. I will still buy your next album."
4,jobst 30-40mm/hg,"The socks work well--if I order again I would go for the 20-30 mm, simply because the 30-40 mm are quite warm for summer use. Good product, and would recomend them to anyone who needs this kind of sock.-"
4,Light facial moisturizer,"I have been using this product for several years. It is a nice light facial moisturer for use daily under makeup. Not too oily, not too thick."
1,Useless,This product did nothing for me. My face felt dry within an hour. I threw it away after the first use.
3,ok for on the go!,"This is a good product, it is light , fragrance free and easy to use on the go! I have been using it now for a little over a week on some problematic dry skin on my forehead, nose and under my eyes, it provides relief and as I said is light and not oily so I use it while I'm out but overall my Cetaphil face moisturizer is a better product."
3,burned my skin - didn't improve skin,I bought this based on the reviews. It burned a little which alarmed me and I didn't wake up the next morning feeling moisturized. Also some of the ingredients I think are carcinogenic the BHT etc. I really wish cosmetic companies would not use such ingredients.
3,Face cream,This was not for me. It caused me more breakouts and made my rosacea flare up even more. It does work nice on the neck area but no miracle product.
5,Absolutely stunning.,"I have been playing guitar for about 6 years now, so I know a good quality guitar when I see one.LOOK: This guitar looks stunning. The wood grain, the fret board, the headstock...just everything. This guitar will drop jaws every time you pull it out.FEEL: My guitar came with PERFECT action straight out of the box (highly unusual...especially for a guitar bought online and shipped). The guitar is extremely comfortable and easy to play from day one.SOUND: This guitar isn't just flashy, it has exceptional sound as well! I think it could sound a little bit louder at times but it always plays deep, full, beautiful sounds. It will truly please your eardrums.QUALITY: This guitar is of quality construction from top to bottom.-------------------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION: This guitar easily sounds, feels and looks like a $300 12 string. I would recommend this to ANYBODY interested in buying one!"
2,Cannot exceed medium heat!,"Before using pans, I noticed the caution that you will damage the pan and void the warranty if you use more than medium heat."
2,Better Out There,Do not care for these pans...the ridges on the inside bottom of pan are hard to clean.
1,Never Supplied....,"I ordered this item months ago, only to be told it was back-ordered, and please be patient. Then after waiting several weeks, I was told that they just weren't going to be supplying them at all but thanks for trying."
3,"About the Author - please make correction to the word ""fincial""","....His specialties in the areas of M&A; and ""fincial"" controlling.Regardless of this, I am buying this book and hopefully would not have typos in the book itself."
5,No Kidding,"I heartily recommend No Kidding by Wendy Tokunaga for a book group selection. It is very well written fiction that provides an indepth character study of a 35-year old woman who wants to choose her own path to happiness. Because the topic is provocative, it leads to very active group discussion.Even if you do not belong to a book group, I recommend this for both men and women. It's good, thoughtful entertainment."
4,A Great Read,"No Kidding is a refreshing read. I enjoyed reading about a heroine who stands up for herself and her choices--Audrey Mills is a confused, witty character that I loved getting to know. This book will keep you invlolved until the last page, and if you're anything like me, you will be disappointed when it is all over. I look forward to more work by Tokunaga."
4,"Even If You're a Mommy, You Can Still Laugh","I did enjoy this funny, irreverent diary style of story. It's not an easy feat to make this type of story very interesting but this author managed to pull it off for me. These characters are alive on the pages, they feel like people we all have met or really know in our lives. The author has managed to breathe true interest in that thirtysomething crowd, plus all the family and friends around. When Aldo, the gorgeous new coworker is added to the mix, well, the 'stuff' hits the fan quickly enough that you want to see where it takes Audrey.Even if you are a dedicated mommy, you can laugh at the sarcasm aimed at pregnant women and women with babies. Audrey has definite life choices to make, different paths to choose from and where ever she goes you want to follow just to see what happens next. No Kidding is fast, fun and worth your time."
3,NOT for beginners!!,"The title said ""Instance CGI/Perl"" so I bought it thinking I could do it instantly, being a complete beginner. No way.This book is designed for people who already have an understanding or some knowledge of cgi already. I can't even make it to page two and I go cross-eyed. It is an excellent book when it comes to modifying scripts and getting into perl stuff and will probably come in handy AFTER I learn how to do it in the first place.If you are an advanced-level user, then you will probably GREATLY benefit from this book. It has unbelievable advice and detailed instructions on web applications used in cgi.But to be honest, I didn't understand a single word of it."
1,"Not Instant CGI, More like Instant sofa leg.","If you are looking for a book on cgi, don't even waste 3 bucks on a used copy. The only place this thing deserves is taking up space at the author's home.I used the instant ASP scripts a few years ago and taught myself asp to the point I have done several corporate intranets. I am familiar with Perl and the Instant CGI only confused me. If you want to learn cg, buy something else."
2,It was just OK for me.,"I'll be honest, I didn't like this book, I wasn't caught up in it at all. First, it was very slow starting - I like books that get right down to it from the first pages and keep it like that as you continue. Second, the book had too many narratives about nature for my taste, so, to be honest, I ended up skipping through a lot of pages. Even the conversations between main characters weren't that interesting. The mystery was just OK also. (Warning, a little spoiler here: the part with her cousin and the reason for her involvement was a bit strange and didn't make much sense to me). From the romance part, because the story had a sad part to both character past stories, the heat between them wasn't on the forefront, and that made it not so exciting for my taste. So, it all comes down to me liking different type of romance/suspense reading, so, I know that I will not be trying any more books by this author."
1,"No romance, lousy suspense","Here's one more writer whose abandoning her readers in romance to write ""suspense."" What a gyp! Mariah Stewart used to write wonderful, family-type romances, but now she's trying to be another Tammy Hoag or something and it's not working. People who like real suspense will feel as cheated as her romance fans will.These are the whiniest, weakest characters she's ever created. I didn't care about any of them. Please, Mariah,go back to the booksyou use d to write so well and don't try to be something your not."
1,Too strong flavor and aroma for cats,"My cat, who is not a fussy eater, would not eat his food when I use this product. It is good in concept, but something, maybe the ginger is too strong. I tried for a couple weeks/months to get him used to it. Bought 2 jars, now it is too late to return it, so I'm out the money. I don't recommend this product."
2,a waste of cat food,"My Burmese rag doll, a sensitive breed, was repulsed by the addition of just a little of this powder into his Iams. Result: toss the Iams and start over. I am going back to Bach's Rescue Remedy Liquid in his water bowl."
5,They had a follow up,"I loved this CD so much and was SO bummed when Kevin died. They did have a follow-up though. They replaced Kevin with the lead singer from Mr. Mister and named the band ""Third Matinee""."
1,Dont believe the hype,"OK, I admit it: I believed all the hype. All the reviews (both here on Amazon and elsewhere) had me hooked. I NEEDED TO GET THIS RECORD! I ordered it thinking I was in for a musical treat of undiscovered genius.Boy, was I completely wrong.This is one of the few cds I've ever returned without remorse. I could find little here that was redeeming (and I can usually find something I enjoy in any band). The music reflects the writers: a group of session musicians with unmistakeable technical ability, but no talent to make a song that pulls at your insides. If you want some musical genius, get Jeff Buckley, or Stevie Wonder, or Radiohead, or Arcade Fire, or the Smiths, or a host of others, but not this one. Its just not worth it."
5,Masterpiece,"The fact that only 3 out of the 47 reviews here are less than 5 stars says it all. This is in my top 5 favorite albums of all time. The production and performances are awesome....but the song writing....well, Kevin Gilbert was one of the finest lyricists of our time. I put him right up there with Lennon, Dylan, etc. What a tragic loss. ""Things She Said"" makes the hairs on my arms stand up every time I hear it."
5,A HIGHLY underrated album...,"I never really understood why this band didn't ever seem to make it or take off... this album is simply phenomenal - probably one of the most highly underrated albums I can think of... ever. Good groove, great harmonies, wonderful arrangements and some stirring, possibly even sometimes disturbing and/or controversial lyrics (and yes, some probably even of ""historical"" significance).At the time of release, ""The Ballad of Jenny Ledge"" probably got the most radio play with ""Last Plane Out"" being the other radio hit -- I can't really think of another band to compare, though some facets and similiarities to ""Mike and the Mechanics"" (particularly their self-titled album) come to mind, with some possibly much darker lyrics and more complex pieces in Toy Maitinee."
5,Reviewers of taste,"To all the reviewers who feel as I feel that this is an outstanding and highly underated and unnoticed masterpiece, you might want to look into the second CD ""Third Matinee"" which brings Richard Page (Mr. Mister) into the fold. Equally outstanding (check out Giraffe ""Giraffe"" as well, 2 Giraffe records on 1 CD; available at the Kevin Gilbert website)."
4,Great game package,I love this game package there are a lot of games for the money. I would recommend it to a friend.Ultimate Mahjongg 20 (Jewel Case)
1,Hard to see tiles,"Own many games of MahJong, and this one is the worst if you have lower vision. The tile set is hard to see, which does not help speed of completing. I like to have different tile sets for variety. I would not recommend this particular game; there are others out there that provide more game pleasure."
2,game,I am disappointed with this game. It is slow in responding to your actions. I expected something a lot harder and more challenging.
2,Fun games --- not,"Nice selection of games. The only thing missing were instructions to the multitude of games, which ruined the experience."
3,Rear mount install,"Rear mount is easily installed by removing the rear mount bracket, and leaving the mount in place. Unfortunately, I did not notice any less engine movement. Perhaps I didn't tighten the bolt enough. I will adjust this review if it changes, but as of now, it didn't help anything. The good side of that, is that the engine isn't shaking my dash apart. I did not notice any more cabin noise after the install."
3,GREAT BRUCE TIMM Cover!,Glad to have the book but it does ramble all over the place. Wish it was more organized and professionally laid out. There are way too many con drawings and not enough original art.
1,I was not satisfied with the product. I ...,I was not satisfied with the product. I could not peel the strip off the backing in three of the six pore strips. The three that I did manage to peel didn't seem to live up to the claims.
3,I didn't really like the Biore Pore Perfect ...,"I didn't really like the Biore Pore Perfect Skin Strips. I have very sensitive skin and while the strips did clean my pores it hurt to take them off and they left a red mark on my forehead and chin for about a day. I sure am glad I didn't have anywhere to go the next day or I would've been pretty embarrassed. I might recommend this product, but only for friends who don't have sensitive skin."
3,They were real good the first time I ...,They were real good the first time I used them. They cleaned out my pores really well. The second time I used them it didn't do much. I would use them again though.
3,I have used the Biore Nose Strips before ...,"I have used the Biore Nose Strips before and they work wonderful, so I thought the Face Strips would also be a great product. I was wrong. I tried using these on a few different occasions, and they do not work! I put them on a few problem areas, and waited the time they ask, peeled them off and they did not do the job. I was disappointed in them and would never buy them. I think Biore has some wonderful products, but this isn't one of them."
4,Wow! Biore deep cleansing strips work great. It ...,"Wow! Biore deep cleansing strips work great. It was amazing how much they lifted away. My skin felt and looked smoother. I have tried a different brand of cleansing strips before and wasn't really impressed. Biore is definitely superior. The only negative is that it dried out my skin, but nothing a little night cream didn't cure. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with clogged pores or blackheads especially if you have oily skin."
4,Some of the best R&B and rap of the year,"After last years 2000 Grammy Rap Nominees album that had only ten songs, it is nice to see that there are now more songs for your money on this year's album. It is good to see that they have now added R&B to the disc. The rap songs are ones that almost everybody has either heard on the radio or TV. Even after hearing them many times they are still enjoyable. The R&B songs showcase some of the future legends of R&B and soul music. With all of the compilation albums coming out that only have a few songs that are actually any good, it is nice to see a CD full of great songs. Being someone who listens to a lot of rap and R&B music, I definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this music or anyone who wants to start listening to it."
4,calvinist-bent,"a very useful and illuminating reading. It' s a pity that the author's bent to see in the calvinist position all those virtues of good morality and tolerance, is not supported by true historic matters of fact: e.g., as for"" the corrupt Catholic Guise faction"" opposed by the liberal-minded Porcupine Henry de Navarre "" (pag 59)- even if an idea somehow shared by Shakesperae himself - could I suggest another reading of the History auch as that proposed by Jean Dumont in his ""L'Eglise au risque de l' Histoire"" ?"
1,Major bug in game -- don't buy it!,"I would not recommend buying this game. There is a fatal error in that various parts of the game do not unlock so you can never beat it. The fields and meadows never open up, and you're stuck there for the rest of the game. Very very frustrating. I've written the company asking for a full refund. We'll see how that goes."
3,"Good Game, yet confusing","My 10 year old sister got this game. She says that she likes it, but when it comes to taking care of pet inpatients it gets pretty confusing because you have to treat and play with many many pets every day while you still have to earn your money as a vet, and in the end you spend a lot of the money you earn in medication for inpatients and the other patients. Sometimes you end up ""stuck"" in the game because you have to spend so much money for food and meds and you don't get to accomplish certain tasks that require you to save up a lot of money."
4,A Fun Game But there is bugs,It was fun but the fields and meadows never unlock like there suppose to. By the way to run hold down shift. Its in the manual. If you can't figure out what to give an animal look under diagnosis at the bottom of the file it will show you what to give it. Without the bugs its a fun game. (IF YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX THE FIELD AND MEADOW PROBLEM PLEASE POST IT!!!!)
1,Pet Vet Review,"I was tricked into buying this game because of the descriptions it gave on the box, it sounded like a lot of fun, but really all I did was throw away twenty dollars. The gameplay is slow and the graphics are terrible. When you treat animals, it's not like you can decide what to do about it, the computer just tells you what to do, so there's not much of a challenge in this game. Even though the box says it has over twenty cases, they are repeated over and over and it got so old. I wanted to treat all kinds of animals, but the game starts you out with hamsters and birds, and you have to pay like seven hundred dollars to take a class so you can treat just one animal. Overall, this game was a major disappointment."
4,Not very fun at first..,"It is really hard to keep money in this game without going down the drain. I just want to bond with dogs,cats and what not but it takes forever to unlock everything. I hope it gets a little more fun over time so i don't regret actually wanting the game in the first place..but i bet it will"
3,"Fun, interesting, however...","This was a fun game for anyone who wants to be a vet, is a vet, or just likes animals and wants to relax on the computer. You start out healing small animals, rabbits, guinea pigs, birds, then work your way up to cats then dogs then horses. Supposedly, and this is where my troubles arose, you can ride the horses to other locations after you unlock the locations. However, even though I did everything the game told me to do and followed the ""plot"", I could never unlock the other locations. I don't know if it's just my disk or if I'm just not playing correctly but I have played the game on several computers so its not just the computer. But it is a fun game to spend 10-20 minutes on every once in a while."
1,Thia Game is SOOOO Dumb,This game was a good game then it deleted my cousins file and nobody pushed the delete button!
3,Would be great if they came out with a fix.,"I think it is a good game but as it is now you can not finish the game until they come up with a fix for the fields & meadows not opening up. I wrote to valusoft about it & this is the response I got:Dear Paws and Claws Pet Vet Customer,Thank you for your recent communication. We are looking into this issueand have contacted the developer. We hope to have a resolution soon.Thank you for your patience.Regards,Tech SupportI see people have been having this problem since June, you would think they would have came out with a patch or something by now. I would recommend that everyone who has this game write to valusoft & keep writing, maybe if enough people bother them about this they will come up with a fix."
3,Game would be better if you could open the other areas.,"Bought this for my 8 yr old Granddaughter;she treated all the animals, made money went through schooling and still could not open the restricted areas. You need to save the levels during play because it locks up and if not saved during the play it will go back to the previous level. Even with this my Granddaughter still played but unfortunaltely because she could not open the other areas she is no longer playing the game. I see that many folks have had the same problems; game needs to be fixed!"
3,Very Fun But...,"This game caught my eye at best buy and since I love animals, I had to have it!The installing part was very diffucult for me. My mom had also very trouble installing it and we have a 98. I deleted my other games because we thought we needed room on the hard drive ot something but we didn't and I wasted all the games I worked hard on.We tried the lap top and it seemed to workng fine at the start but it kept crashing every once in a while. :(The game is very fun itself.. from what I played anyways... but i'm not too crazy about the graphics. It is a challening game, I agree but we couldn't keep it cause it crashed too much and messed up our computers.If you want to risk buying this game for that price than go ahead, but my tip is to wait till it's cheaper so even if it didn't work, you would not have lost as much money as we did (19.99)Thanks for reading :)"
2,Too Confusing!! The Riding Areas Never Unlock!!,This game was a total waste of money!! It's confusing and the vet has to run or walk everywhere. It takes forever. It's not easy to see and the animals never get better. One parakeet hasn't left for a whole month!!!! It's annoying. Don't waste your money on this game. Get Animal Hospital any day for a good Vet game.
5,Still a great laptop after 5 years,"I bought this in 2002 and it was the smallest ""real"" laptop computer available. It still works great for me. Make no mistake, this is not a ""main"" computer. It is a second computer. The 20gb drive is enough for the OS and a few applications. I basically only have IE and Office XP on it. It works great. I travel with it all the time. The original battery died - probably because I used to leave it plugged in all the time. I now have two batteries from ebay that work fine ~3 hours each with wifi on. I almost never use the CD/DVD drive, and am actually happy to leave it at home when I travel. I used to load DVDs onto the HD to watch on flights.I have been trying to find a replacement, but really don't see anything that meets my needs. I keep looking at the Samsung Q1 Ultra, but it gets poor reviews.The only thing this is missing, that I wish it had, is a built-in camera for video conferences with my kids when I am traveling."
2,Don't buy,This multi disc tape has about four songs on it.....that are worth it....the rest is not .....save your money....i wish i had....
2,Stalin; Still Unknown,"As my children are related to Molotov by marriage, I am always interested in new books about Russian figures, especially since the fall of communism. I will persevere with this book, but it is frustrating to be told ""Stalin eliminated many rivals on his way to the top; historians know their names."" Thanks; what about the rest of us? Also, Russian translations have a certain annoying quality bordering on condescension: ""If you're reading this book you must be ignorant; otherwise you'd know it all and wouldn't have to read this book""! In general, are translators working from first to second language, or vice versa? That would affect their choice of words,and we should be told. There is still a lot of habitual excuse-making and spin control, even when one of the authors has been exiled since 1973! This must be part of the Slavic genome. But I still plan to finish it, and I think it's worth reading, especially if you are part of the Russian diaspora as I am."
2,Soft pop buries great talent,"Mainstream pop/vocal with a little latin spice for flavor. Lettau has a great voice that is buried in an over use of synthesizers, bland backup vocals, and a production that aims for an accessibility of easy listening. Why do great voices like Lettau or Whitney Houston keeping making records that are so uninvolving. There is nothing remarkable on this album other than Lettau herself and unforunately she just gets lost in the onslaught of the producers attempt to keep her safe and not let her explore music as an art. Sound quality excels. Song choice--who can tell, they all pretty much sound the same (could really have done without her interpretation of Joni Mitchell's ""People's Parties"" which was horrendous even with the nice touch of Brazilian rythms). Overall, a waste of a great talent."
4,fun for almost any age,"This is a quality product, one in a line of die-cast car models. It is solid, well-crafted, and beautiful. How much fun it is, however, will depend on the child and the child's age and interests. It doesn't move on its own, needs human power, but this model can take a lot of pushing for the child willing to play with it as it is. Many a boy would simply set it on the shelf and enjoy pride of ownership--it's that great."
3,He loved it,Couldn't buy the real thing yet so this substitutes for the real thing. He has it on his mantel proudly displayed. Sounds corny but its cute!!
1,"Terrible feedback, lo-fi sub","I bought this subwoofer based on the excellent reviews found online, but what a disappointment. This subwoofer sounded horrible from the first minute. The receiver that it was plugged into was a Sony STR-DA4ES.DON'T BUY THIS SUB AT ANY PRICE."
1,Disappointed,"When I received this it was not what I expected. Said it was a paperback, It was not !!! I went to see this and have a program. Bt the way, it was great!!!!!"
2,"It was very gentle, although I didn't feel ...","It was very gentle, although I didn't feel as though it cleaned my skin very well. When I tried to use it to remove eye makeup, it didn't work, but it didn't irritate my eyes, either. If I had sensitive skin, this product would be great. Since I don't, I wouldn't purchase this product, nor would I recommend it to a friend or family member."
1,Rip- off,"I emailed Acoustic Research,What is the white fiber in the middle of this 16AWG wire? It seems to be just taking space where there should be copper. It seems to be a rip-off to me & I'm not getting a full 16AWG, but 20AWG or less worth of wire!I didn't think I was paying for filler!Response> ""This cable was discontinued before Audiovox acquired this AR product line. We don't have any support information about it"".Thank you for using Audiovox.Ed.Customer ServiceFiber surrounded by copper you lose about 1/3 where the copper is missing. Then a oh we know nothing response from them."
2,Against my better judgement,I should have listened to the other reviewers.I needed 100 feet altogether so I bought two of these and I have to say I too was suspicious of the fibers in the middle of each line of wire. The heavy duty shielding also makes it difficult to know if you are actually getting 16ga wire; it made it so I could not fit even a single wire through my speaker stand. Not a good buy; monoprice.com however had exactly what I needed.
2,Easy to use... easy to need repair,"I had this camera for little over a 1.5 yrs. It need repairs FIVE TIMES! The last three times it was sent in, the problem wasn't fixed so Sears let me trade for a newer version, VL-AH151U, free of charge. I didn't even need a warranty. GOD BLESS SEARS!"
3,Easy to Use,This product is easy to use -- simply plug in and forget it. No getting my dog to swallow pills. It seems to run out in a few days under a month.I can't tell how much of a difference it makes. He sleeps on his bed more when the comfort zone dispenser and he seems to be somewhat calmer.
1,Dap Diffuser,I really did not see any change in my dogs behavior after using this product. I really had hoped for better results. Maybe it depends on the dog.
2,Not for us,I think it's a great idea. My vet said it really only works in about 60% of dogs and I guess my dog was part of the 40% it didnt work for. Too bad!
1,Check your facts,"This purports to be an album of One Hit Wonders, but it's anything but. Loggins & Messina was no one-hit wonder. And how did ""I Think I Love You"" get on there? The Partridge Family had more than one hit, David Cassidy had more than one hit, and Tony Romeo (the writer) also wrote ""Make You Mine"" for Lou Christie. This looks like an OK collection of music, but has nothing to do with One Hit Wonders."
4,"Credit where credit is due, please.","First of all, Get right. Whitney Houston butchered the classic song, by Chaka Khan. If she wasn't Whitney, no one would have cared. This version at least is likeable and lacks the histrionic over production of Whitney's ""cover"""
4,These aren't just cock and bull stories,"For a logophile such as myself, this book is a treat. Since acquiring it, I've made it a habit (as I've done with some other books in the Facts on File collection) to randomly review at least ten of the entries per day, as ""work,"" and often peruse it just for fun.A good example of an entry is ""all in a dither: In a jittery, agitated state. This expression dates from the early 1800s, when it also was put as *of a dither*. The noun dither comes from the Middle English verb didderen, meaning to 'tremble.' A newer synonym is *in a tizzy,* dating from the first half of the 1900s. Its origin is not known.""Aside from the source of the phrase, this is a useful book to learn *what not to say.* If a word or phrase is clichéd, it shouldn't be used. In a nutshell, one could consider this book a safe haven from the etymological equivalent of giving up the ghost."
3,Turgid,"How can something so full of interesting facts be so dull to read? Nevertheless, it's true - pedestrian writing and inadequate editing manage to drag what should be a fascinating read down to the level of just another book stuffed with stuff."
5,Awesome!!!,"I thought this would be just like any other book. At the beginning, I was a little wary with the outline and didn't have much confidence, so off it went to the side. The next day I went through the extract chapters and couldn't put it down. Mr. Chirillo you did an AWESOME job of putting all that information together like that-keep going."
5,RECOMMENDED,"In the past we've been full of praise for the two others books in this series. It's now been joined by another, called Hack Attacks Encyclopedia. If you want to know all there is to know from hackers of the 70s, 80s, and 90s, check it out!"
1,An Unnessary Dry Read,"If you enjoy statistical data against a backdrop of geographical data and political wrangling you will certainly enjoy this book. It is disconnected, difficult to stay interested in, and impossible to follow without a schematic illustration. I had the misfortune to sit in on a lecture by the author; he seemed as bored as I was. There are much better books available that give the same information and that are more readable. If you have completed all those other books, then by all means read this one! It was written for you."
5,Perfect for your home setup.,"Buttons work smoothly. Case is heavy duty. Very versatile device.The six channels can be used as input or output. You can even have multiple outputs and inputs going at once. The device is very flexible in how you can use it. I have seen similar devices at radio shack for about the same price, but this is much higher quality, using more industrial construction methods.Five stars, at least. Old school quality."
2,It buzzes.,"I got the item to be able to play several different inputs into one new set of stereo speakers including a TV and two different computes.The problem I have is that when I plug in the TV while the main computer is connected, the output buzzes, even if that input is not turned on.Not sure what the solution is.Pete Antoniak."
5,A tug on the heart strings.,"I felt for the heroine, who gives up her child born of aweekend affair. She's been abandoned by her husband, has a mountainof medical bills and has to care for her son, who is dying. She givescustody of her daughter to the child's father, Daniel, for one year. Now a year is almost up and Daniel doesn't want to give up his child... I found myself cheering the two on, hoping that they would get past their emotional hurdles and be a family. I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief, though the road wasn't always smooth. This was my first MP book and I'm still looking for it."
2,I tried and returned.,"I have to say that i tested in Hong Kong, and the biggest problem is that just recognize or simplified chinese or tradicional chinese (depend of the model that you bought). Finally i bougth a cheaper model with no LCD screen that need conection to the computer, but have the flexibility of simplified or traditional, in the same package.Also both model have the problem that only recognize dark letters in a white paper, dont try to scan for example yellow letters in blue paper because doesnt work, just traditional books."
3,3 and a half stars seems more appropriate.,"I hate to say it, but this cd just doesn't have staying power. the songs are easy to get into, with nice solid grooves and some very satisfying moments(for example, what sounds like ""are you mad? are you mad about that?"" yelled at the end of ""introducing the creeker sneaker""). however, after a few listens, ""shake harder boy"" just doesn't seem to have much left to offer.it's a nice experience while it lasts, but I'm not often compelled to put it back in the old discman.don't write off harkonen completly though, they wrote some pretty strong songs for this cd, and definitely took a big step from their self titled debut. harkonen is a solid band, and they may become much more"
4,Great Handlebars ( but ),"Nice handlebars. Was able to keep using my bike in a more comfortable position with these.The only warning I have is that it would be more accurate to say that theyare ""Gloss"" black, not the typical flat black color of most bike parts.I lightly sanded them and applied flat black primer. Now the handlebars look like original equipment."
2,It tells you what you already have to know to understand it,"The book starts at a level where you already have to know what is coming. Every topic is presented with technical details, but so brief that you can only guess how to use it in a project. I wonder who the book is written for: It is too technical for a manager and not technical enough for a developer."
2,Disapointed,"Maybe I recieved a defective boombox, but I am disapointed with it. The first second or two of songs on CD gets cut off, especially when recording onto tape. Also, you can't turn it up very loud. For the price, it is ""okay"" but I would rather pay more and get better quality."
1,Don't buy this Boombox,"I brought this radio because it is small and I wanted to use it at work to listen to the radio or my tapes. Needless to say that the door for the radio broke off within a couple of days and the CD player just wouldn't work. I sent it back and got another one but the CD player didn't work on that one either. If I could have given this radio zero stars I would have! Whatever you do, do not buy this boombox."
1,piece of crap,This radio is garbage. The radio can't get in the strongest local station. The cd player skips. The overall quality of the product is terrible and I'm a product designer.
1,AVOID THIS PIECE OF JUNK!,"IT STINKS! I had mine for about a year. Yesterday, it ate a tape, so the tape player and the tape are ruined.Even before the tape eating incident, it seems flimsy. If I open a drawer of the dresser it sits on while I am playing a CD, the CD skips, and I have to turn off and turn on the player.Why did I buy this? Because it was cheap.... I should have consulted Consumer Reports. At least I bought my other gadgets (computer, scanner, printer, digital camera, TV, and VCR) with more thought instead of impulse."
1,I Wish I'd never seen you!,"Last Christmas, my mom and I decided to go buy a cute littleradio. We got this sleek little charmer in yellow and it is SO cuteand small and light. It seemed perfect- until I tried to record oneof my CDs to tape. The copies always come out fuzzy and hard tounderstand. The volume is never right on them and, well, it might aswell not even offer the feature. The CD player takes forever to loadthe data from the CD. Although I don't mind giving it a couple of goodslaps on the side every time I want to put on my favorite songs, itcertainly doesn't make me happy. My Boom Box also has this habit wherethe lid won't stay shut, so you have to hold it down. Sometimes itwill run without my having to cling to the top of it, but it almostalways stops at the most inconvenient time displaying that the lid isopen... even when I'm holding it down!... If you want a good CDplayer, buy anything by Sony. Even their cheapest, worst one is farsuperior to this."
2,You get what you pay for,"This CD/AM/FM/Cassette player is getting poor reviews from most consumers; so I have to say....you get what you pay for. If you want an inexpensive CD/RADIO/Cassette; then buy it. If you expect it to last....forget it! I have had experience with Boom Boxes from White-Westinghouse, GPX; which are similar to this one; and they have all been disappointments. They either had poor bass, poor recording quality, or poor radio reception.BUY IT AT YOUR OWN RISK....BUT KEEP THE RECEIPT! IT is your only hope of returning it."
2,boombox does not play,I got this boombox as a gift about 8 month ago and it does not play any more what must i due in order to make it work.i am not happy with the product
2,Doesn't work half the time,"This seems to be a love it or hate it item - I bought one for one son and it was adequate, didn't plan on recording or having ""theater quality"" sound. Doesn't have any extra features, but I didn't pay much for it either. I bought a second one for second son and the CD player on this one doesn't work half of the time, makes a sort of grinding noise and decides there's no CD there! Opening and closing the door repeatedly eventually will make it work, but I'm shopping for something else."
3,more hits by paniagua,"Paniagua 14 great hits. Is a good cd if you dont all ready have them. IT was recorded in 1990. Now its 2003, he,s rere corded most of these again. CASE IN POINTS 1999s GREATEST HITS which has these same songs.EXCEPT THE VERY AWSOME GUARACHA QUIEN LLEVA LOS PANTALONES. WICH IS VERY HARD TO FIND ON CD!!!!!!!!For that iam giveing it 3 stars good cd if you dont have these songs allready. Or just for that one hard to find song"
1,Not useful for me at all!!!!,"Unlike a lot of positive comments about this book, I found it terribly difficult to underestand! There are things that have been over explained (that bores you to death) and things that do not have any/little explanations (things that I always had problem underestanding them)! What sort of begginers book is this?!"
4,"Mercy,Mercy,Mercy me!It's just too cool!",I have had this disc for a few year's.It is really energetic.Passion's is a great song that should be played everyday.Chieli Minucci does a great job on all song's.Bemshi is cool as weel.This is great music. Check it out?
1,Full of holes and black mold after 4 months of use,"I bought these toys after our old toys became full of mold. The only reason why I bought these boats is that it said that they are ""Mold Resistant"" and the water cannot go inside.To my disappointment, 3 out of 7 boats have holes in them after 4 months of use (only once a week, so it's 16 times). I discovered to my horror that they are full of black moldy water.. I am not sure whether they came like this or became like this during use. It doesn't matter.The bottom line, I am very upset, I wish they were made better!Or maybe I got a defective batch. It would be nice, if I could get a replacement or return them but of course, the return window expired long time ago.I would not buy this product again. To everyone who is thinking of buying, just be cautious that you will have to inspect them regularly. You may be surprised to find holes and lots of mold inside."
5,Colorful Bathtub Fleet,"Our 18 month old grandson was having difficulty making the transition from the a small basin to the large tub. This toy was wonderful. Between naming the colors, adjusting the sails, and hooking up the boats to tow them around he would now spend all evening in the tube if we left him. The pictures do not do justice to the toy."
3,"Fun, educational, but could be made better","My 2 year old son loves his train set, and he is getting bored with all of his bath toys. So, I thought he would enjoy the fact that the boats link together, like his train, and he gets to play with it in the tub. These boats are very educational with the different shape sails and colors. I give him two choices of shapes or colors before handing him them to play with. He enjoys playing with them in the tub and at the pool. But, the boats do not stay linked together. The boats are made from a flexible, softer rubber like material, so there is no way to permanently bend where they hook together to keep them from coming apart. Also, one of the boats got a small hole in it during its second use. Now, it fills up with water and sinks. It probably won't be long until it smells like mildew. If they were made better, I would definitely buy them again as birthday gifts for other children my son's age."
2,Leaky ships after a month,"These are really neat little ships and my daughter loves to put them together and pull the pieces apart. However, I noticed the other day that a couple of the ships aren't floating so well and were in fact leaking. The problem is in the section of the boat where the sail gets inserted. I tried to fix it myself, but the water won't come out of the hole and they don't seem to be drying out on their own. I'm thinking of using a pin to make the hole larger so I can get the water out, let it dry, then try to use some glue to make it seaworthy again. Very sad since baby liked them so much."
3,Mi corazon lloro,"King Clave es de los mejores expositores de musica de ""antaño"" y la cancion ""Mi corazon Lloro"" es una excelente cancion en la cual al escucharla va uno entendiendo de que trata la platica entre el señor y el niño que tienen por telefono, que al final se da uno cuenta que el que esta hablando es el papa del niño. Quisiera saber si la cancion ""El vagabundo"" la canta tambien el?? saludos"
3,Good but not Perfect,"I run these cables under a silk Persian rug that is extremely thick and heavy and the cables are still visible. Then again regular cables would be even more visible. It is a bit of a pain to work with. Sound is good, I'm not a complete audiophile nut job so to me it works well. Overall a decent item but dont expect the wires to be invisible under the rug."
4,"great sound, easy to conceal",I upgraded my system to 7.1 and needed a good wire that I could surface mount and conceal reasonably easily. The AR PR361 fit the bill perfectly. My system is complete and sounds awesome and I was able to run the additional speaker lines and keep them hidden fairly well. I would say it's a must have if you don't have the option to run your speaker wire through conduits inside your walls.
4,Flat and inexpensive!,"I uploaded a photo to the gallery above comparing the Acoustic Research PR361 to regular 16AWG cable and in-wall 16AWG cable. As you can see, the Acoustic Research cable isn't really much thinner than regular 16AWG cabling. However, the benefit comes from the flat, rectangular shape of the cable that makes it much easier to lay across a living room floor and under a rug without curling or twisting up. It also feels a bit heavier than regular cable so once you lay it out, it'll stay put better than lighter cables.Pros:- Flat, rectangular shape is much, much easier to work with because it doesn't twist up as easily.- Feels a bit heavier than regular cable so it'll stay put once you lay it out.- Despite being a ""special"" thin cable, it's actually cheaper than the regular cables that you'll find at brick & mortar stores.Cons:- Not wafer thin like I had hoped, but still good enough."
4,"Good cable, no connectors as advertised","Very nice product, thin and flat, fits under carpet, on baseboards, is paintable, and has the + side clearly marked. Description says 30, 50, and 100 ft. spools come with pin connectors, but I ordered a 50 ft. spool, they were missing, returned it and got a replacement. No connectors again! Had to buy my own connectors and solder them on. Aaside from this it works great with my hi-def system."
2,This cable will turn yellow in less than 5 years!,I bought some of their cable back in 2005 and it's now yellow. This is due to cheap fire retardant chemicals in the plastic/rubber sheathing. I'd suggest trying a different manufacture if this might bother you.
4,Cetaphil's texture is somewhere between a gel and ...,"Cetaphil's texture is somewhere between a gel and a lotion. It feels very nice on the skin, cool and moisturizing. Cetaphil felt so gentle on my skin, I didn't think it could possibly remove eye make-up. Was I ever wrong. Cetaphil cleaned up every trace of stubborn mascara and eyeliner, all without irritating my eyes. I applied Cetaphil straight to my face and removed it with warm water and a wash cloth. I found that this was the best way to rinse away any residue the cleanser sometimes left behind. I washed my face with Cetaphil twice a day and it always left my skin feeling clean, soft and moisturized. In addition, it's reasonably priced, a little goes a long way, and it has no fragrance. The one thing I found is that sometimes I need to use a toner to remove residue."
5,Excellent product,This is a very good product! This is excellent! It does what it is suppose to do and therefore I am definitely buying this again if I need to.
5,Excellent!,"I absolutely LOVE this movie! I saw it many years ago when it can on TV, and now I'll be able to buy it on DVD. Outstanding performances by Tim Dalton and Linda Purl! The movie is full of suspense, and romance. It is a ""must see"" for everybody."
4,Works as it should,The right and left crown molding support worked great. One reviewer said it does not work at all. He must have an older version of the saw because it attached to my saw with no problem and it was easy to adjust. My only complaint is the cost. The same crown molding support for a Dewalt saw is half the price.
1,garbage,"there's absolutely no power to it at all. even worse, i thought i was getting 150 watts, but the manufacturer's manual says 80. do not buy this product."
5,Wonderful Adventures on the Sea of Cortez,"I gave this book to my fishing addict husband for Christmas, and he has had his nose in it ever since. I have to schedule my reading of it when he is busy with something else! We also have traveled along the Baja Peninsula for many years, and recognize the places that Ray wrote about all those years ago. It has really changed, and not for the better, but you can't turn back the clock and undo the harm that commercial fishing/netting has done to the Sea of Cortez. So if you would like a little nostalgia along with the most exciting tales, fishing and otherwise, this is the book for you! Ray Cannon must have been a very colorful character, going from the Hollywood movie industry, to the isolation of the Sea of Cortez. It's full of fabulous black and white photos too. It's pricey, but well worth it. Wonderful for a special gift."
5,fantastic!,"This is a thriller of Arthur Upfield at its best:nice suspense, nice description of Australian bush, good story. really pleased I bought it"
4,Carrying Case for T519,"Very good price, got what I needed and came in pretty quickly even using standard shipment."
2,"Good concept, bad execution","This is a book for beginners with good concepts for organizing a website, BUT the book has many, many errors on the CD and in the information given, especially with regards to CSS. You will be very frustrated if you rely on the book to create great menus. The example menus on the CD are pretty basic and boring. Flash is discussed for navigation, but never mentioned in the book is that Flash links will not be noticed by search engines!! .css files on the CD are mistakenly .html files and visa versa. Also, example images often do not appear on the same page as the text explaining the examples. Discussion of example images in the book focus on color, but all images are greyscale and this makes it very difficult to utilize the image examples in the book.There are a few good tips for more experienced designers, but hardly worth the price of the book."
2,Warning,"CD Rom is a mess, with missing and/or mislabeled files. Peck should post warnings and corrections on her Web site - her credibility really suffers from these errors. There are some helpful tips for using small type in menus and whatnot, but these tips alone are not worth the price of the book."
3,Promises unkept,"I started to read this book with high hopes. I finished it feeling that I was still at the beginning. There was no follow through on the concepts. I did not learn much about how to implement various types of menus, nor on the fundementals of the underlying code and concepts to get me going on my own. With the exception of her discussion on CSS, which I feel is the only redeeming feature of the book (and why I gave it threes stars instead of two), I feel like I was listening to someone talk around the topic, rather than get to the heart of the matter. Unless you are using exactly the same tools to do exactly the same task as her demos, this book is not going to be much help.If you buy this book thinking that you will learn how to implement various types and styles of menus you will be disappointed."
4,Experiencing Aretha Live!,Aretha Franklin's Live At Fillmore was suggested to me by another fan. This CD is all that and a big bag of chips.Aretha Franklin has so much energy and you can tell she is a true entertainer.The crowd screaming her name makes you feel as though you are in San Francisco at the Fillmore West for the concert.Her calling Ray Charles on stage to perform was awesome.Every song is crisp and clear. The band is with her song for song.i was surprised of the two CD's from different performances. I can listen to both and still feel like I want more.
4,Aretha and King Curtis,"I picked this up along with the King Curtis Live at the Fillmore set. I wanted to get the feel of the whole shebang. Plenty of evidence here why Aretha was rated as the #1 singer in Rolling Stone. Confident, relaxed, unerring she takes the band and audience with her where she's going - must have been a great trip for those who were there. And what a treat to have Aretha backed by King Curtis and his terrific band. Put it on, sit back and relax, empty your mind, and let the music take you to a place where time slips away and what matters most is bathing in this voice, this band, these songs."
1,AVOID!!!,"I saw this on discount in a store for a nice price i thought my self how bad can this be?this is by far the most pathetic attempt to make music i have ever seen or heard i cant even tell you how bad this composition is. i was expecting something like Cafe del Mar or Buddha bar, but i was insulted 10 tracks that loop on and on and on.the track begins with an electric sound thingy then just keeps repeating through out the song i tried to listen to the track but four minutes is as far as i can go there is not a single track that is worth listing to sure it comes with a dvd with same tracks with images but it as I said the music is terrible.save your money for anything. watching your money burn is more entertaining than listing to this! REALLY ITS THAT BAD!!.there are other albums from the same company i assume its from the same level do your self and your ears a favor and avoid walking next to this junk.I really cant stress how bad this is.....just avoid."
5,Best dog treats ever.,My dogs love these treats. Originally found them at Petsmart but they don't carry them anymore. I'll search high and low until I find them before I buy anything else.
4,Our JRT Loves them,"Our fussy girl doesn't usually care much for crunchy treats, but she loves these.I wish they were made here rather than China, but I don't give her too many at a time or feed them too often.It's just one of the treats I rotate giving her and she really likes them."
1,Product of China,"We bought dog treats directly from Smokehouse in the past and I recalled they made a point that their products are made in USA. So I was rather disappointed to read on the label these are a product of China.Our dog likes them but with all the news about melamine in animal food in China, I will not buy these again."
1,Disappointed in this Product.....Misleading,"This product states 100% Natural. Which it's not, because it has Wheat Flour and Salt as a additive, or preservative. It's not hydrated but slow-baked/roasted and when product like this is cooked like this it looses all it's nutrients. It's also made in China, which should tell you something. If you also look on the label it has a stamp on it that this product has been treated with ""Irradiation!""...yikes, you want to feed this to your pet?...I think not."
1,Not at all worth the risk.,My dogs nearly died from eating chicken jerky treats from China. Kidney damage is permanent. Please think twice about using this treat.
1,Smokehouse Chicken Chips dog treat,"Nov 2011. I previously gave a 5 star rating for this product. I have ordered this product every month for several months including the Jerky product. BUT, one of my poodles has become ill. These products are made in CHINA.Yes, my poodles love this product. We will no longer order this product. I pray Amazon will take this product off their market.Chicken Skewers Dog Treats, 4oz"
1,PRODUCT OF CHINA,Never would have ordered these if they had put the country of origin in the description. Be aware that these are produced in China.Stick with the Smokehouse Beefy Bites which are made in the USA.
1,No more of these!,"My dogs love these but I'm going to throw out all that I have left in the house when I get home today. Just realised that they are made in China thanks to another Amazon customer's review, hope I have not damaged my pets' health with these--there are multiple alerts on the web concerning China -made Smokehouse products containing dangerous additives . Will be more careful in the future and an looking for an American made replacement product. 2/20/13--FOLLOW UP After two months of not feeding these to my dogs I would like to report that certain digestive issues they were having frequently have stopped. I have substituted an American made similar product--unfortunately not sold on Amazon."
4,Duplicae order,"I have bought these before...my dogs love them and the size so they can carry thema round, their not real big."
4,Good for small dogs.,"I have two American Eskimo dogs, and so these are good for them. If I had larger dogs, these treats would be too small for the dog to enjoy. Again, good as a treat for small dogs, bite size pieces."
4,Smoklehouse Chicken Chips,"Very good product, although the added ingredients make it very bad for allergic dogs. A listing of all ingredients on the web site would be very helpful when purchasing."
5,my doxies,My two doxies love these treats. My one doxie will walk to the counter and bark for one while the other one sits on the couch and waits for you to bring to her. The one on the couch Dyna will count how many you give to Harley to make sure she gets the same. I have turned my friend on to these for her doggies and they love them too.. It is thier night time snack
2,These are still from China,I was going to buy these but then i read where it said that the product was a Product of China and is irradiated for your pets safety. Well i decided right then i didn't want them. Just because they are put through radiation i still don't think that makes them any safer to give my dogs. Why can't we find things that are made here in the USA and with more natural ingredients that are safe for our animals to eat.
5,dogs love it,This is a low calorie treat that all my dogs love. Try it and see for yourself. Must have 3 more words.
5,Truly fabulous!,"Lisa Vroman is a soprano goddess, and has impeccable taste in orchestrations. You won't be sorry if you get this CD."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,I live in Lisa's hometown and i have always heard my parents and my grandparents friends talking about how great she is. And about 3 or 4 months ago she came home and performed at the Dullas State Office Building. And her voice was the best. So after the show i bought the cd and she signed it. I took it home and listened to it. It is just like hearing her live. She is the best in the industry. Her voice is exceptional and she is a very accomplished singer.BUy THIS ALBUM
1,Complete piece of rubbish,"I hate this boombox, it is the worst piece of sound equipment I have ever had. The FM/AM is extremely weak, and the tape player makes this awful hissing noise, CONSTANTLY, even when the power is on but before you play the tape. The CD player is not so bad, thankfully, but thats NOT ENOUGH. Caveat emptor!!"
1,Read this: DO NOT BUY!,"This boombox really REALLY stinks! Do not buy! When listening to anything, the speakers hiss like crazy. Even when brand new, it hisses. At the end of a tape, it doesn't just click off, it clicks and cranks which ruins the tape and the tape player. The cd player is a peice of junk, it takes about 45 seconds to realize you have a cd in the player, and then take another 20 seconds till you can switch to the right track. We had to exchange it twice, but they both rott. Do not buy this crud, its waisting money!!!!! (It only has a ninety day refund, so buyer beware!!)"
1,Can you say BORING?,"Although some of the subject material is interesting, this book is poorly written and just plain BORING. The author must have been paid by the word; he fills over 600 pages with petty details of relatives and co-workers. I had intended to read this book cover-to-cover, but I just couldn't stomach some of the meaningless drivel. This book could have been a good read at 200 pages, but not 600+."
3,"disappointing but entertaining, a banker's life story","I expected Hugh McColl, the great CEO of BankAmerica, to be more than this. It turns out his grandaddy was a rich banker too, so there's some essence of nepotism. There's a lot of dirty politics too, so it's not as fun as life stories of Michael Dell or Bill Gates. Anyway, for a potential banker like myself, it is interesting to know what goes on in Wall Street and various banks and the kind of politics one must contend with.Though not the sole hero, McColl did build a North Carolina bank into a big league player challenging New York big leageurs like Citibank and Chase and at one point even beating them. For those aspiring to challenge the greatness that is New York, this may serve as some sort of inspiration."
2,irritated my skin more than anything,"I purchased this product because I was so impressed with the Alpha Hydroxy Face Lotion, as it leaves my skin bright and clear and I have minimal break outs, so I figured the facial wash would do the same.. So I stopped using my normal face wash and I used this product instead for about a month and I noticed more irritation if anything... It wasn't really stopping my breakouts just leaving my skin red with more bumps than normal. I thought using the both in conjunction would just work best but I'm starting to think my skin is too sensitive and cannot take too much of the same thing? I am not quite sure... but I'm going back to my old facial wash and sticking to the alpha hydroxy face lotion. Another thing is that facial washes really do not exfoliate your skin.. They just tone it.. and I think I need more exfoliation or I wish they had exfoliation beads in this product.. Maybe it would've worked better? Idk.."
5,i love it,this is the best face wash. ive had acne all my life and i have tried everything and i swear by this product. ive almost given up trying other stuff because its all a waste of money. i was thankful i tried this one and will stick with it. im using it together with their enhancing lotion and its the only thing that made my skin clear in years. i just hope they wont take it off the market--please.
4,"Similar to cetaphil, works great!","I think this works wonders. It's the only face wash I feel comfortable rubbing roughly over my eyes to remove my eye make-up, which it does wonderfully. It's extremely gentle and reminds me of the highly dermatologist recommended Cetaphil formula. It's a one-stop shop for cleaning my skin and make-up off at the end of the night."
4,I'm happy,"Since using a few of Alpha Hydrox's products, my skin has been clearer overall.I use a dime-sized amount of this cleanser twice a day.**update**I first ordered this in November 2011. My second order was placed 28 Feb 2012, and today, 5 June 2012, I am ordering it again."
5,Great Brand,"I've used a lot of products, professional, cheap, expensive and this stuff does the trick. Great for combo skin, hormonal adult acne."
3,cheaper but less effective than another cleanser I was using,"I feel that this cleanser is on a par with the Neutrogena stuff I used to buy. It cleanses, but it also strips my skin of moisture, and the accompanying lotion and cream are not moisturizing enough to restore the balance. I'll be going back to the more expensive, but much more effective, Jan Marini bioglycolic line once I'm out of this stuff, maybe before then!"
1,This has Paraben,"I was expecting this to be a paraben-free product because the ingredients listed on the site does not say paraben. However, the ingredients listed on the box lists both methylparaben and propylparaben. I'm pretty disappointed."
1,Smelled,"This face wash is not supposed to have any fragrance, but it did have a mild odor. Nothing overpowering, but I was looking for something totally odor-free, and I was disappointed. I used it for a couple of weeks and it seemed to be working pretty well, but the smell bothered me."
3,It's ok,I do see some smoothness in the skin after a week of use. Otherthan that haven't observed anything good or bad.
2,so-so,"bought this because the reviews seemed good and I admit the product was good for the first 3 weeks. but now it makes my skin extremely dry. and I started breaking out on my forehead,and I never breakout there. since my skin Is so dry now I stopped using it -__- guess it didn't agree with my skin :/"
4,Awesome hydrating face wash,"As a man it took me a while to understand the importance of using a face wash that doesnt strip moisture away. After using my wife's Hydrox cleaner I noticed it left my face feeling clean, free of oil, yet not taught or dry. Amazing. So off to Amazon I went and found this wash which seem to be a good price. It definitely feels the same if not better then my wife's more expensive stuff. I highly recommend it. Also its alot neater than having a bar of soap floating aroung bathroom sink all the time."
5,BEST FACE WASH EEEEEEVER!!,"I've used Alpha Hydrox products for over twenty years. I've tried other products now and again, but always come back to them because I find them the BEST skin care products out there. This wash always leaves my skin clean, baby soft and helps keep is soft and clear. I have teens and between us we use the A.H. acne treatment, lightner, lotion, etc. GREAT PRODUCTS at a GREAT PRICE!"
4,Works well with other Alpha Hydrox products,Leaves my face soft and not dry. That is a good thing because I have used other face washes that irritate my skin.
4,Love it,I've been using this for years and have moved to a remote area where there are no retailers who carry it.
2,Cleans well but too strong for sensitive skin,"I have very sensitive facial skin prone to acne. I began using this night and day, as directed, for about 1 week. It cleanses well and thoroughly, but after about a week of usage (washing twice a day (as indicated in directions), I developed dry skin with red rosacea-like patchy bumpy areas on my skin. I think washing twice a day or even once a day with this cleanser, may be too much for very sensitive skin. It may be OK to use a few times a week during the night. After stopping using it, I continued to have red patches and bumps on my skin which took about a few weeks to heal. If your skin is NOT sensitive to alpha hydroxy acid, it may be OK to use, but I have decided after using this, that my skin must be sensitive to the ingredients, so I returned it.Note: you should make sure to wear a good sunscreen since using any products with AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) can make your skin more sensitive to the sun."
5,My favorite face wash ever!,"I am a complete devotee of Alpha Hydrox products in general, and the foaming face wash in particular. It removes makeup with no sting to the eyes and cleans gently and well. I just wish I could still buy it in stores. No one seems to carry it anymore. We must keep them in business! Buy this!!"
4,I really enjoyed using this product and will ...,"I really enjoyed using this product and will continue to do so! It's a soap-less wash and therefore doesn't leave me with that tight, dry feeling I always get from using soap on my face. The best part was discovering, upon reading the packaging, that they also have a soap-free body wash. This is also a great product for people like my mother who have developed severe reactions to soap on their skin. I called the 1-800 telephone number and this very kind company immediately sent some samples out to her! This is a quality product made by caring people. I highly recommend it and the Neoteric Company to anyone!"
4,It didn't cause any skin discomfort (any degree ...,"It didn't cause any skin discomfort (any degree of irritation), which is most important in my book. It's comparable to other foamy face washes I've used before (Olay, Ponds, to name a few). It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean immediately after using it and feeling soft the next morning. Other than a bit pricey compared to some other brands, I'd recommend it to friends."
5,the search is over!!,"Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash - 6 fl ozI have been looking for this product on the shelves for years and finally decided to go online. Not only did I find a great price, but I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! It came quickly and was packaged safely for delivery. (no spills)"
5,ALPHA HYDROX FOAMING FACE WASH,I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 20 YEARS...EVER SINCE IT WAS FAVORABLY COMPARED TO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES.ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IT IN THE DRUG STORES NOW SO THANK HEAVEN FOR AMAZON. I BUY A HALF DOZEN AT A TIME.
4,Very Good Product,I have tried many soaps in my time to deal with acne and skin issues on my face. They all left residue or over dried my face usually just making things worse. I been using alpha hydroxy for just over a week and have seen great improvement. I have normal to oily skin due to my working environment as a chef. I have to say this removes the nasty mess after work while leaving my skin in good condition. Great Product!
4,Good Stuff,This product makes my skin look smooth but I have to use it sparingly. It can dry your skin so I use it every two days. I like to use it under other products to enhance their benefits. This is a good investment.
3,Not really sure but,"I am sure it works anyway but I hate the fact that its so watery though I am sure a little bit goes a long way with the watered down type formula. Also I paid $10.50 Which pisses me off. I was looking for a cheaper price around $7.00 and just now seeing it after purchasing it last week. Trust me, I couldn't find it for any less than $10 last week when I ordered. Anyway, its all good."
2,Not sure it made a difference,"I bought this product based on the rave reviews about using it as a treatment for acne. I currently have a strict regimen I stick to every morning and every night that is the only thing that works for me. I added the Alpha in and have seen no significant difference. It's on par with using 2% salicylic acid, which doesn't do much. I won't be repurchasing this as I don't feel it's worth the money.My products:Morning- 15% Benzoyl Peroxide face wash, 1% clindamycin lotion (prescription)Afternoon - 1% Clindamycin lotionNight - 10% Benzoyl peroxide creamI tried using this in the morning before applying my clindamycin lotion and then again in the afternoon after washing my make up off. It's better than using nothing but barely."
1,Would not recommend,"I would not recommend this product to anyone with acne prone skin. While I was using the product for a few weeks it did not have any effect. However, when I stopped using it my skin broke out pretty badly."
1,way overrated,"This product has great reviews, but its complete crap. It feels like your rubbing snot all over your face when you apply it. It doesnt soak in, it just sits on top clogging pores. I used the whole bottle over about 2 1/2 months and noticed no positive difference in my skin, It just made me break out more. At first I thought it was the ""initial breakout"" everyone talks about, so I stuck it out and used the whole bottle and now I regret buying it. NEVER TRUST THESE AMAZON REVIEWS, I beleive the companies employees wrote all these 5 star reviews so you will buy their crap products."
3,Didn't make a difference,"I've been using this nightly for 3 weeks now, and it's not making a difference in fine lines. It goes on smoothly and evenly, tingles a little from the acidic pH, it comes out fast so be wary of small squeezes. I do see some exfoliation by morning, which will peel off if i use a scrub, so be sure to use sunscreen every day if trying this out. Perhaps a stronger glycolic acid peel would make more of a difference in fine lines. I have had great success with weekly salicylic acid peels in preventing acne."
3,Mixed feelings,"I've been using this for roughly 2-3 months and I have some mixed feelings. I'm in my early 20s but have been suffering from moderate to even severe acne since high school. I have oily skin and honestly, I don't think it gives me that much of a matte finish, however it doesn't make me any oilier. I have noticed an improvement on existing acne. However, I have breakouts on areas that don't normally break out, something I find quite odd. I find that it works best when you only use a little bit at a time, too much will sting your face! Overall, I think this is alright. I will continue to buy and use it because it works well on bacne too."
4,This is a beauty staple for me,Alpha Hydrox's oil free formula works great for my complexion. I have both acne prone oily skin as well as the typical over 40 starting to get wrinkles skin. I use the product at night as part of my nightly beauty regimen and find it to be helpful with both of my problems. It's not too greasy or too drying. I would recommend it for those who have the same type of complexion.
1,It Happens.,"AHA products break some people out terribly, and that's what happened to me. At least now I know to be extra wary of AHA. I used it for a month, and reduced the number weekly applications once my face started freaking out. Unfortunately it did not get better from there. Based on the research I did prior to purchasing, this is probably a good product to buy if you already know AHA doesn't give you evil acne, and you don't mind a bunch of parabens."
2,It is not worth,"I like Chinese music and collect many Chinese music CDs, such as Butterfly Lover, Yellow River etc. I thought this CD might be good. However, it is not. The musicians tried to show off their instrument skill instead of playing good music. Poor taste!"
3,A decent overview.,"This was a quick read and provided a reasonable overview of collie ownership. This would provide excellent background for someone just beginning the dog search and wondering about breed history, general care, and an overview of temperament, behaviors, etc.However, if you're looking for more of the ins and outs of dog ownership, I would suggest something with a little more content."
4,Greatest Rap and R&B album of the year!!!,"This is an excellent CD!!! If you like the Jazzy, blues sound of Jill Scott and Erykah Badu or the heavy rap of Eminem,DMX, and Dr. Dre w/ Snoop Dogg this is the perfect CD for you! It comes with everything a CD could come with from the easy listening of R. Kelly's ""I Wish"", to the booming, get up out of your set a dance rythem of DMX's ""Party Up"". I encourge anyone and everyone to get this CD!!!!You won't be disappointed!"
4,"Just the Facts, Mam","This review book is formated in such a way that I can actually help my child with homework. I go directly to the section she's learning, and can quickly review the section that's current to her learning needs. She and I can do the reviews together and this wouldn't be possible without this book. I especaily like that I don't have to refer to hundreds of pages before being able to help my child."
5,GREAT DEAL,"I PURCHASE THIS WIRE, I WAS PLEASE WITH THE PRODUCT. IT CAME WITH BANANA PLUGS INCLUDED THIS WAS A SURPISE. IT LIES FLAT AS ADVERTISED, I WAS ABLE TO RUN IT ALONG MY BASEBROAD , ALL THE WAY TO MY RECEIVER, NICE AND TAPERED.I WILL BE BUYING ANOTHER SPOOL ."
3,Good performance but a bit pricey,I bough this sub about a month ago and I am fairly satisfied with its performance. It works will with my Home Theatre System and movies ound great with it. However it is a bit lacking if you like to listen ot bass-heavy music like rap or dance. A bit of 'boominess' sets in at frequencies below 70 Hz and the volume has to be quite low for it perform decently at under 40Hz. Overall Im fairly satisfied with my purchase but I do think this sub is a tad overpriced for the level of performance it gives. So be sure to shop around before you make a decision on buying this product
1,waste time and money,this stuff does not work do not waste your time trying to get it most likely a scam
1,Body Odor Capsul's,I took 1 capsul daily the first week with no change. Two capsuls thesecond week with no change and third and fourth week's I took 3 cap-suls a day with some inprovement. SO far this product hasn't worked theway I was hoping for. I have enough capsul's left to take 3 a day foranother month. Hoping for improvement.David E.
1,Waste of Money!,I have used this product since it was purchased 3 months ago. I have not noticed a difference. I wish I could get my money back.
3,Illuminating the Shadows,"The Woman Who Owned the Shadows by Paula Gunn Allen is an example of a Native American woman's struggle to find purpose in her life within several different minorities. These minorities include being a woman, a lesbian and a Native American.While the content of the book was thought provoking and enlightening, it was difficult to follow. Even with the text being put into sections, each representing a different aspect of Ephanie, the main character's life, it was hard to follow at times. As a result, I would encourage this book to the readers who like and are capable of reading a text very closely, but not for a beach read.Reading this text closely though, the reader is able to move with the cyclical journey of Ephanie as she escapes the shadows of her past that have left her life in chaos. Using her story as an example, this book urges the readers to step into the sunlight and out of their own shadows."
4,a 5th Flying Saucer Attack in all but name.,"Clear Horizon is Dave Pearce of Flying Saucer Attack with Jessica Bailiff. The two recorded the album via mailed recordings to one another.While I haven't heard any of Jessica Bailiff's work, Dave Pearce's contributions to this album are very obvious. (i.e. the droning guitar feedback amidst folky acoustic guitars.) The only real problem I have with the album is that it's a little bit too same-y and meanders a bit much. But while there probably won't be another FSA album, this will suffice.The duo are apparently working on a second album face-to-face, so hopefully that'll iron out some of the weakers spots on the album. As a whole, Flying Saucer Attack fans will enjoy this."
3,Different from the original,"It's great that 21 Jump Street is finally out on DVD, but for some reason, they have changed the episodes. The background songs are different and some of the episodes have stuff cut out of them. I guess I'll just have to keep my copies of the show I taped off the tv when it originally aired."
5,Great TV show classic!,"I was a fan of this show as a kid growing up and decided to buy a few seasons to see how it holds up. It's still a great show, but cheesy at times. The price was dirt cheap, but it is a Mill Creek release so the disc come in envelopes."
3,21 Jump Street,The second cd has some kind of issue it will play the first 2 episodes and then locks up.
3,Just a textbook!,"To be honest, this is one of the first books I ordered when I went into medical transcribing for a pathology lab, and I have yet to actually use it as a reference. It is a pretty standard overview on the functions of clinical and anatomical pathology. Moreover, it is outlined in textbook form, with new vocabulary words in bold throughout the text, and actual review questions at the end of each chapter. Just to reiterate: this is not meant to be used as a reference guide. To all you new transcribers out there, start with a Stedman's word book, along with a good medical dictionary (Stedman's or Dorlands). These will help you far more than this will! Good luck!"
5,Filled My Savvy Sponge,"I read Working Woman's Arst of War in 2 days, between my schooling and work. I couldn't put it down. It is right on, truthful tactics, to receive personal success for the women of the 21st century, and for the future. A classic to read and pass on to daughter generations. It deals with subjects such as jealousy, sexuality and harassment, men and other subjects and twists them around to a positive point of view in dealing with such areas of the workplace. This book teaches women how to be winners, and understand that they have just as much potential, if not way more in today's society, for becoming a leader of the home or business venture. Chin-Ning Chu, the author, also brings in a positive point of view on anything today's society likes to use as an excuse for not winning. She has found the real essence."
3,Not his best work.,"This book continues Bass' string of engaging, vivid stories concerning his journeys in the American West. What lessens this book somewhat is an atypical harshness towrds people. When Bass and his compatriots encounter private property in the wilderness, they respond by littering! Perhaps it was the company he kept during this time, but this novel was a bit too testosterone driven for my tastes. Read The Ninemile Wolves, instead."
5,Beautiful writing. Highly recommended.,"As Rick Bass and Doug Peacock go high and deep into Colorado's San Juan Mountains, on the chance there might still be grizzlies somehow surviving there, we are treated to glimpses of unspeakable beauty and wonder. It's as though Bass were able to blend his own Ninemile Wolves with Peacock's Grizzly Years. Their journey is both exhilerating and meditative. Reading this book was a pleasure."
2,we don't need any more how not to do it books,"Just tried to read this book about a bunch of losers trying to find the last remaining grizz in the CO San Juans. GAG!I've lost ALL my patience with 40ish adults that think they are on an epic with bottled water, a farting dog and Vienna sausage. I didn't make it past page 45. I'm 50 years old, I've hiked thousands of miles and been around enough hardcore PCT folks to recognize the real deal. These guys are total amateurs and a total bore.Why right a book about what not to do. There are a lot of those out there ... ""I'm a grade A city dirtbag trail loser... Read my trail loser memoir"".Kids in their 20s doing the same stuff get a free pass and bonus points from me for just being out there. I did this stuff when I was in my 20's. Well not quire that bad...I was better than that by age 14. But not adults in their +40s trying to write a book.Read something by Craig Childs if you want to see a pro in action."
4,It does work.,"I bought this product a month and half ago. I have been using it once and twice a day. and yes it is working. My skin started to get softer and look better. It is so annoying putting it in the body. But, its worth it. that part of the skin is gonna be so much better in so little time."
5,Great for pople on acne meds!,"I'm on a combination on topical clindamycin and BP to treat my acne. These medications dryout your skin horribly to the point where it leaves white scaly patches on the face. My Dr. prescriped Lac-Hydrin Five and since use, I have not had a single dry patch on my face. I use it twice a day (in the morning and before bed) about 15 minutes after I have rubbed my acne meds on. It has not caused any break outs, and my faces actually looks dewy and youthful. I highly reccommend this lotion!"
2,"Ehh, I haven't noticed a difference",I purchased this to use on my upper arms and elbows where I sometimes have dry skin. I haven't noticed a difference since starting to use it.
4,Good product need to buy one more,Good product for the price .this is a very good moisturizer .I used this one in USA b'cos I used to similar one in Sri Lanka.
3,Lac-Hydrin,This product is a good product but it did not work well for me because of my survive callus skin. I was using it on my feet and it did not work for me.
3,"Lovely Lotion, but not for Me","I bought this thinking it would help with keratosis pilaris on my upper arms, but I didn't seen an improvement. I faithfully applied morning and night for three weeks without seeing a difference, and gave up. Perhaps if I had gone longer it would help, but I was kind of over it. It's a great everyday lotion though - not greasy, nice and light without a heavy scent. I just wanted it to clear up my skin and it didn't, so my instant gratification self was disappointed. But it's worked for other people, so don't give up!"
2,.........,"This toy is probably better for smaller dogs. When I gave this toy to my 65lb dog it was done within like 2 mins, I also thought it was a pack of toys the picture had 4 tires..I was disappionted when I recieved only one."
5,excellent cookware,"Hats off to Calphalon. This griddle lives up to the meaning of ""non-stick"". I just made blueberry pancakes this morning, didn't put any oil on the cooking surface, and when I went to turn them they slid across the surface so easily that I think I enjoyed the cooking more than the eating. Will be getting more Calphalon products in the future!"
5,Love this griddle!,"This is a great griddle. Great for pancakes, french toast, sandwiches. The nonstick surface is good quality, the piece itself is nicely weighted. Love this griddle! No regrets."
1,be careful of the ingredient potassium hydroxide,"acording to ""A consumer's dictionary of cosmetic ingredients, by Ruth winter, M.S.""the ingredient potassium hydroxide says ""...When applied to the skin of mice, moderate dosages cause tumors. May cause skin rash and burning. Concentrations above 5 percent can destroy fingernails as well. Good quality toilet soaps do not contain more than 0.25 percent free alkali. It should be kept away from eyes, as it can cause blindness. Should be applied by professionals only, according to the EU."""
2,Not the parts reference it claims to be,"Based upon the editors description I thought I was getting a detailed field book describing specific parts that make up as-designed M1's. Not so. The specific information is sketchy, it includes almost no parts photos, only low quality line drawings. Much detail is left out and few exceptions to the general rules are mentioned. Some of the factual information is suspect (""The round operating rod spring was the same for all manufacturers and did not change during its production life""). Personal experience with CMP issued rifles suggests this is not true. An ""OK"" book for beginners, serious collecters should search out a copy of the Duff manual."
5,A serious gunshow companion,"The book is very helpful when looking through a parts bin to find the right part for the serial number you want. Nothing more, nothing less. It's not a complete reference for every bit of info about the Garand but it's enough not to get ripped off from a ""oh yeah, that's the right part"" dealer. Very handy indeed."
5,Gary Mac,"Very informative, covered every aspect of the rifle in great detail, also addressed serial numbers of all parts, dates, changes in production including modifications"
5,"The M1 Garand, 1936-1957","If you have a Garand and wonder about the myriad of parts, or you are a beginning collector this is the book for you. I can only wonder about the number of hours that went into the research of this book. I restore, buy and sell complete Garands and parts. This book helps me immensely about what I'm buying and how rare, or not, it might be."
2,full of information and history,"The book is a wealth of information and history but I was disappointed in the number of errors in the lists of serial numbers and draw numbers. More realiable information in Scott Duff's books. Make sure you double check the information. This is a 5th edition, the errors should have been corrected by now. Not the best book I have on Garands."
5,Excelent!,"Es un excelente libro para personas que estan interesadas en historia de armas, asi como para coleccionistas."
4,Truly an enjoyable experience.,"Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen has always been one of those consistently strong bass players that have lent their talent to nearly all of the great jazz artists for decades. This album, under his own leadership, shows a slightly different side of the artist. The music owes as much to european music as to blues. Is all of the music here ""jazz""? Who cares. What matters is that the music presented here is consistantly enjoyable. The musicians, which include Ulf Wakenius on guitars and Jonas Johansen on drums, bring a subtle beauty to the music. The guests, which are many, include Phil Woods on saxaphone, Oscar Peterson on piano, and vocalists Monica Zetterfund and Monique. Of special note is the wonderful track ""Summer Song"" which features the artist Monique on vocals. Believe me when I tell you that this track alone is worth the price of the cd. All in all, you simply can't go wrong with this very enjoyable album."
3,"Easy-to-read, many bugs in the material, good TCP/IP book","This book was a great text for teaching the Microsoft Certified System Engineer TCP/IP courseand the optional SMS course. The materialis dated because of its tie to NT 3.51 and needsto be updated. There are numerous errors in thematerial including contradictions in the text andpractice questions that have incorrect answers.If your purpose is to pass the certification exam, this will help."
5,Oooh... This is the Good Stuff!,"For decades, I've been on a neverending quest for the magic elixir that will tame my frizzy, curly hair... and this is it! Team this with a good round of blow-drying and your hair will be swingy, shiny, soft and smooth - it really is great stuff.It's worth the extra $$$ - I've tried countless products and honestly, this is one of the best performers out there. Also, a couple of pumps go a long way - this bottle will last a really long time! I team it with the matching shampoo and conditioner - expensive but again, you only use a little bit and you can really feel the difference in quality.Kerastase truly surpasses the Aveda, Bumble & Bumble, Joico, Nexxus, Sebastian and other salon products. Beautiful stuff.If you can't afford this for every day, do what I do -- save your Kerastase for when you have that party, that big work presentation, that dinner out... and use your ""other stuff"" for other days!"
5,Great Product,Great product. it is wonderfully hydrating with out fillers. Both my husband and I like it. WE have used and still use your DML with sunscreen. It was what led us to seek out the DML Forte.
5,best moisturizer for sensitive skin,"I have used this product before ordering it on Amanzon. I have Eczema and get sun burned really easy on my face. Once my face is burned, everything I put on my face hurts it. Forte did not irritate my face and helped it heal much faster."
4,As described.,"This is a generous amount of high quality cream that will help protect your skin through the winter. It is thick and a little goes a long way. Takes a bit to absorb, but for night time use, it is a really good choice."
5,GREAT lotion for folks with sensitive skin,"My son was born with acute atopic dermatitis. This lotion is perfect for keeping him moisturized without causing him to break out. No fragrances, no allergens in the ingredients, no dyes. It's a life saver! I wish it was stocked in local stores, though; I have to order it over the internet, and not only is it a bit pricey, but the shipping charges are killing me. But, it's the only thing my son can use, so I willingly keep buying it."
4,Released in U.S. circa 1976 as a Canadian import....,"...on heavy vinyl. I should know; I've owned my copy since about 1979. This isn't a cheap or recent one-off to make a quick buck. Heck, it probably WAS the ""best of"" in about 1976!This record was of unusual sound quality for 1970's vinyl. It was louder and clearer than any other vinyl album I ever had. No hisses, no pops, outstanding.Songs #5 through #8 are subtley unique versions that cannot be found elsewhere. This version of ""The Ripper"" truly rips.Keep in mind I have not heard the CD edition of ""Best of JP,"" but if the sound quality is as good as the vinyl, then this is a ""must have"" for all hardcore Priest fans. I recommend buying it for ""the Ripper"" alone."
1,Horrbile,"I never thought i would find myself writing a bad Judas Priest cd review but here we go: First off this ""BEst Of""has some great songs but it's a very obvious rip of trying to make money of the priest name, Judas Priest themselves even say this is not one of their albums only a cheep knockoff that they cannot control, what a horrible misleading album to have such great songs or such a great band assioated with, i agree With Priest leave this alone."
1,It really isn't that Great,"Although I'm a huge Judas Priest fan, I didn't really like this album. It's a wonderful 'Best Of' album, but the should have disposed of the interviews and added some songs like Sinner, Out In The Cold, Breaking The Law, Metal Gods, Genocide, Riding OIn The Wind, or Rapid Fire. I am aware some people may disagree with me, but it's just my opinion. Stick with Unleashed In The East, Metal Works '72-92, or Priest...LIVE for the better songs...or if you want to hear the Priest's BEST songs live with their best singer, Rob Halford, check out Halford's newest live release, 'Insurrection Live'."
4,You Can't Go Wrong!,"The Best of Judas Priest is a must have for those hard rockers out there. You can't go wrong with ""Dying to Meet You,"" ""Never Satisfied,"" and ""Victim of Changes,"" as well as interviews with original drummer, John Hinch, and Rob Halford. It's 53 minutes of awesome rock! Get one!"
2,non commercial,"I bought this pan a month ago, and used it on a daily basis. Although I carefully followed the instructions, the interior layer has already peeled at one location.Good thing is Calphalon does offer life time warranty. With $4 postage, I can always get a brand new pan. Bad thing is the Teflon for the nonstick layer is toxic, so I start to warry about the peeled off layer may get into my food some day."
4,Great resource,Great tool to get you started on your Cinderella Unit. Has masters to make copies to give to kids.
1,Cinderella Stories,I did not receive this item. I have tried to contact the seller and did NOT get a response. I filed a claim and didn't get a response. I am not happy with this seller.
3,"As a lotion, the product was great. It's ...","As a lotion, the product was great. It's a typical Jergens product. It helped my dry skin and was thick, rich etc. I was less pleased then I thought I'd be with the scent. It sounded good, but cherry almond just didn't work for me or my wife. Maybe someone else would like it better then we did. When it's first applied, it's a little overpowering, but luckily the scent goes away after ten minutes or so."
3,It's OK but could have been much better,"This book covers a lot of material. It could have been great though with a few changes. Every diagram, sonogram, etc. should have been properly labeled and included the position of the transducer and notch location. This is supposed to be a beginning text. By properly labeling things the student can better learn how the image was made and then practice doing it in the lab. Instead, students are required to just memorize the diagrams. In addition there are some blatent mistakes in the text and discriptions of some of the images. This can be really confusing to new students. Text books need to be 100% correct. This is also an anthology with different chapters being written by different authors. This results in differences in writing styles and the depth of subjects being covered."
2,Very Poor Transfer,"But Schnabel is very inspiring in that he shows you how to approach and how we can interprete music. Usually we have to hear a whole variety of interpretations in order to get a better idea of the pieces. Listening to Schnabel and you can save about 50% of your efforts and the result is twice as good, because he helps you to see music in a new light. Andras Schiff, for example, often listens to and benefitted much from Schnabel.But the transfer here is very poor indeed despite the fact that I have been listening to quite a lot of historic recordings like Busoni on the piano, the Liszt's Pupils, Schnabel/Szegeti, Busch/Serkin, Bartok, Rachmaninoff on the piano... etc but none is more unacceptable than this one even in view of it's low price. Go for other versions."
1,Its got the WRONG tracks!,I have been looking for this record in digital version for a long time. iTunes and Amazon both have the WRONG tracks. It is incredible that neither one of them can get it right. Especially since people have been stating it on the reviews for years.
3,US Version....,"i first heard this in Australia in 1999, and i was blown away. the mixing and track selection was superb, with over 30 tracks on each cd. When i moved to the states the next year, i picked up the US version, took it home to listen, and was quite underwhelmed. cd one sounds like it is cut short, and cd 2 is missing a huge chunk of tunes from the middle and attempted to be mixed together again. it sticks out like a sore thumb though. DEFINETLY BUY THE UK OR AUSTRALIAN VERSION of this cd if you can."
3,Caution: American Release NOT complete.,"The UK version of this double CD set not only has more tracks on it (Including ""Digital"" with KRS-One which for some odd reason was left out of this version, along with some other choice cuts) but also comes with a booklet. I was looking to buy a replacement; unfortunately, the one for sale here is NOT the same as the import version."
3,old school,How the second reveiwer describes it as overmixed is a good dexcription. The first track starts off good then it slows down on track 2 and songs start to feal off in the mixing. There are a few good songs just not every one is real tech. The second CD is old school DnB its not for people that like it fast. Dont get me wrong the CD is good just not one of the best. It took me afew times through to start liking it.
1,NOT INcredible,"If you look at the picture on the album cover, you can see how Goldie feels about how this mix turned out. Or maybe he's hitting the breaking point from listening to hours of this monotonous music. I was duped into buying this one because I saw some names that I really like: Jonny L, London Elektricity, and J Majik. And really those are the best tracks. Sure, this is ""old school"" d'n'b, so ""hells yea, d'n'b headz!"" ""rinsed out, dude!"". Who gives a crap? These tracks are so repetetive, and on top of that, its very poorly produced. And there are very few beats that could stand alone. It confuses me how seemingly a lot of people go nuts over this stuff. But I guess its the same thing as how so many people love country music. I would highly recommend PASSING on this mix."
1,One of the worst mixes I've ever heard,This never should've been pressed. They should've taken the mix and thrown it out. DO NOT BUY!!!
2,Not as it looks...,"The picture displayed shows a small, very shiny heart. However, the ring I received was a lot bigger, more gaudy, and almost black. I tried to shine the ring with silver cream, but it didn't help its looks at all. Also, the ring doesn't lay very flat to your finger, it sticks off and can be annoying."
5,A REAL MAC ATTACK,"I'm such a Jackie Mclean fan it is almost unfair for me to review the ""cut"" ! However, I heard a tune off this CD on the radio. I was completely blown away ! Though I'm sure that Charlie Parker may have had some influence on Jackie, but Jackie cut his own path on the Alto. When you hear him blow you hear "" A REAL MAC ATTACK""! It is one of his recording that seems to have been under the radar. Jackie toyed with the AVANT GARDE, many of his ""purist"" fans were turned off. Jackie also tried Jazz Fusion which also did not go over well! Though you can hear some Avant Garde phrasing on a few selection, Jackie is right at home with so beautiful straight ahead Jazz with a beautiful supporting cast, especially LEE MORGAN ! If you call yourself a Jazz Fan, your collection would not be complete without the cut!"
2,Only half an album Why ?!?!,When this album came out as a LP many years ago it came out as a DOUBLE album.So you would think that when it was finally released as a CD all the songs andsessions would be included. But that is not the case. The missing session wasonly available on the mosaic box set now out of print. So you must buy the LP.Why ?!?!
1,Not Worth It,I purchased this product to use as a drawing instrument. It worked great for the first 3 times I used it. After that it started to crash every time I clicked on something/anything. I was told it was the result of a corrupt user profile. I created a new user profile and it worked great...for three times and bam! It started crashing again. Corel will not refund money for a product not purchased directly from them and I had the product just long enough so that I can't get a refund from the place I purchased it. BEWARE and do not get this software. Don't make the same mistake I made. I wasted money I could have used on a program that could have worked.
1,Not 1-2-3 more like 9-14-23,Who ever wrote the product discription never try to use it.There is a long learning curve and not a lot of help out there for you to get through it.My advice is buy Photoshop at least they publish books to help you get familure with the program.
1,"Unstable, approach with caution","I got version 2 ""free"" with my Wacom tablet. After reading another review here of version 3 it seems not much has changed.Almost every time I try to use this on a Mac it crashes. Not an elegant crash, the app just disappears and the OS tells me ""the application has unexpectedly quit"". Of course my work disappears with it.Not very impressive. A piece of software with 5 million features that crashes is useless. Period.If it actually worked, this would probably be a good piece of software."
4,I had heard Daydream on Smooth Jazz Motion and knew that I had to have the song. I found it on Amazon.com,Mark Johnson has a smooth style and listening to the whole CD I found he has a nice range of music on this CD. I recommend it highly.
3,Personal view,"The service from Amazon was excellent- I tried to find this album on other sites but Amazon spotted what I was after .The Album Mark Johnson ""Daydream"" - As with any album bought ""blind"" one was after some more music like the title track. A bit disappointning in this respect because I just loved the title track. But overall the album is well produced and has a good rapport with the mission statement inside the cover."
2,solar sensor light,"I had this given to me as a gift, so I am unable to use the one year warranty. I installed it quite easily, and the cord length on the solar module was ample to get the module where it needed to be to get the light. Here is my problem with the light. After approximately 8 months of use (charging the batteries the proper way) the batteries are now dead, it is a $29.95 charge to get new ones with $6.50 in shipping. I am in the process of trying to find new batteries that aren't quite as expensive, since they may need replacing twice a year."
2,not impressed,"I ordered this book because it was touted as a ""wedding coloring book"", but I wasn't very impressed. I didn't really think the drawings had enough coloring space on them, about half the stuff would be way over a little kids head unless they had been in a million weddings by age 4. I felt some of the stuff was not really wedding related, just thrown in to add an extra page. All in all, very disappointed and felt like I wasted my money!"
4,No Chieli on This Disc,"This is a different CD for Special Efx, as it is the only one that does not feature guitarist Chieli Minucci. Therefore, it has a very different sound from all other Special Efx CDs. This is actually much closer to being a George Jinda product.It is still a nice CD, just a different sound - more smooth jazz radio-friendly than anything they had done in the past.If you're a fan of Special Efx, you will know that George fell ill shortly sfter this album was recorded, and he never played music again after that. He died on January 11, 2002, and Chieli took over the ""Special Efx"" banner in 1999 and it has been Chieli's band ever since.If you're a die-hard fan of Special Efx (like I am) you owe it to yourself to have this CD in your collection."
3,Straight ahead,"When I first bought this bike, I thought it was great, but I learned that if you were not careful, your pedals would always touch the surface while making a turn. This bike is great for going straight mostly. Last, the rear gear shift is a soft metal so if your over 200 pounds like my neighbor, the metal will bend."
2,Don't buy this.,"Come on---this is the same bike you'll find at WalMart. It's not the same Schwinn you would have bought at your local Schwinn dealer years ago. It's a Chinese made bike. Now, that's not a total knock against it, but $229 isn't really that cheap, even with free shipping. You will need to be a decent bike mechanic to get this into rideable condition, or you will have to take it to your local bike shop--which will cost fifty bucks. For what you will spend on the bike and the tuneup, you can buy a decent bike at a bike shop. Go to your bike shop, spend your money in your community, and get a better bike for just about the same price."
5,Smooth as Silk,"Once again Lemar has proven that he is vocally superior than most of the R&B ""sensations"" that have dominated the US charts for the last five years. Each album has been a growth process, and not only are his lyrics maturing, but his vocals remind me of what singing was about before the video pretty boys superceded true talent. I am disappointed that Lemar doesn't get any recognition in the US because he is definitely one of the UK's brightest gems."
4,dope moisturizing lotion,recommended by a dermatologist for dry spots. works great as a moisturizer as well. not fragrant nor greasy. use this at home and refill the sample bottles for travel.
5,Great moisturizer for sensitive skin,This moisturizer was recommended by my Dermatologist 20 years ago for my Rosacea condition.It is great for sensitive skin. I can't find it in local stores. Through Amazon I found it atother stores and have it shipped directly to my home.
2,Not as I expected,"I have very sensitive skin, and I bought this for my face. It is not as emollient as hoped for, and it made my skin tingle and burn, so I can't use it for the reason it was purchased. Other store name brands (""intensive"" types) work better and are much less expensive."
5,Great product,"Wonderful product. An excellent moisturizer. Use it everyday.Best for sensitive skin. Light, not a heavy lotion. Keeps the skin clear."
4,I fell in love with this book,"I fell in love with this book for the normalcy given to such an unusual experience. I live in Miami and can just imagine myself in some of the places mentioned. This really is a book about love and wisdom, imparted without spiritual pride, which so often comes with spiritual experiences. The author is not telling the reader what to do or how to think, or feel about spirituality, she just says it's there. I bought a second copy for my kindle so I would have it with me and have it read to me. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks about the mystery of life, or has had, or wants to have an encounter with the other side of life on Earth. The truly amazing thing is that several people I spoke to about the book have had similar experiences."
1,I didn't like this book and found it to be confusing,"It was hard to get in to this book. It reminded me of other great books: Conversations with God & The Anatomy of the Spirit, but they were fun to read and I felt like I learned something. I recently read excerpts from Signals by Joel Rothschild & Tuesdays with Morrie and found them much better reading and less phoney."
2,This book was re-hashed new age mumbo jumbo,Don't bother reading this junk. Go straight to Neale Donald Walsch's books or Brain Wiess.This is a waste of time money and the paper it's printed on.
1,Are you Kidding?,"It is a shame people will read this New Age garbage. Try some REAL orthodox books, Francis A. Schaeffer ""True spirituality"", ""He is there and is not Silent"". Basic Christianity. Books by C.S Lewis.If you are a true seeker than the above book are for you, if not then read this author who is not even a Christian. then you can feel good but changes nothing. You can't understand truth and true spirituality by humanistic methods and the classical orthodox truth is God is not our buddy, God does not love everyone unconditionally, and the god of this book is a pagan god. Can't believe the positive reviews."
5,UNFORGETTABLE,All I can say about this book is that it has stayed with me long after the last page was read. A very exhilarating and rejuvenating read.
5,excellent read,This is a great book for learning. I can see a benefit for both the gay children and straight parents. I think this would give clear insight for straight parents and how both could benefit with a clear parental understanding.
3,An honest opinion,"This book leans a lot toward the gay and lesbian agenda and it's not what I was initially looking for. However, it certainly shows a different perspective on homosexuality."
4,It's a good book; get it.,"Despite what this guy wrote in the last Amazon review of 'Jack', it's a detailed and ultimately quite enjoyable accountof a good part of Jack Bruce's career, and his life. Does it touch on everything? Of course not. It would take a few volumes to do that. But what it DOES cover is done very well. Where else have you seen all JB's basses and amplifiers (both electric and acoustic) given such attention and described as they are here? If you're looking for a Cream book, look elsewhere......but if you would like something about the man, and heart and soul of that band (sorry Eric) 'Jack' will do nicely. I would suggestit be a book you own."
5,The best Hardy boys book ever!,"This book is a fast paced thrill ride through drugs,sport and money. Frank and Joe try to relax at a beach complex and take in some volleyball but when one of the players die frank and joe must investigate. It's the game of there life..and the competition is murder."
3,Good stuff/ lacks in some areas.,"I found this book to have some comprehensive information on the philosophy of iaido. However it had very little information on the sword, katas and the motions of iaido. I believe that both are equally important in the study of Iaido."
2,"Ok, addition for your library","This book is an interesting read but not written by a ""writer.""It has more of a feel of a diary that someone wrote in order to chronicle his lessons while in Japan (there is basically no information about ""western lessons"" and the use of bokken).The photography is amateurish, there are misspelled words, and the narration doesn't match the illustrations, but the book is good in the way that it helps you to understand the committment that is involved in starting a new martial art.I enjoyed reading it but was left with a feeling at the end of ""That's it?""Ok on the bookshelf with the rest."
4,An Old Favorite,"This is a 1944 recording of Wilhelm Furtwangler conducting the Vienna Philharmonic. It's not quite as crisp as the other popular 1944 recording of Bruckner's Eighth, by Herbert von Karajan, but it is still quite good.If you have never heard Bruckner's eighth symphony, you are in for a treat. It is the best-known Bruckner symphony for the very good reason that it contains both powerful and absolutely sublime, ethereal music. I am impressed by the quality of this 1944 performance. Once you become hooked on Bruckner's Eighth, you'll be curious to hear every available performance of it. Furtwangler certainly holds his own, even when compared to the best of today's conductors. It really should rate a bit higher than 4 stars."
3,Second Bathroom,"For a house that only has one bathroom downstairs, this product is awesome and has saved me $16,000 by not having to add a bathroom upstairs. Thanks."
3,Urinal - works OK ..,What can you say about a pee bottle?? It works as designed and described by the retailer... It is the same bottle that the drugstores sell for twice the price... Just beware of the funky lid.. None of them fit securely on such light weight plastic material..
1,Great if you don't need a lid!,"I guess my title pretty much sums it up. I bought two at the same time and both have lids that won't snap on, so I went over to where I bought them and went through a rack of the same ones, and NONE of the lids fit right. There were 14 on that rack."
2,No tender muffins here,"This muffin pan delivers what it promises: non-stick muffins. But the price you have to pay for that is muffins with hard, cauterized bottoms and sides. They are tough, tough, tough. I am willing to do a little extra cleaning of a pan to have more tender muffins."
4,Betsy and Tacy,"Betsy and Tacy Go Over the Big Hill read as one big story as opposed to the first two books, which seemed more like lots of little short stories. It wasn't as cute as the first two, but I guess that's to be expected. The girls are growing up and their stories are growing with them. I still enjoyed it, though, and I'm still looking forward to seeing how the girls grow up. While I still have the most in common with Tacy, I'm starting to relate more and more to Tib. I like how she seems a bit embarassed by some of the things Betsy and Tacy do. That reminds me of myself when I was younger.I really looking forward to reading the rest of this series!"
5,Latter-Day Fake is Awesome!,"What happens when you combine clever writing, talented actors, and a gifted director? Answer: A great film and Latter-Day fake fits all of those listed above. This film is a very original and refreshing take on what it is to be a latter-day saint or mormon, and the common misconceptions of their lifestyle. You'll love seeing the hilarious moments that all audiences, whether LDS or not, can relate to. The characters are so easily likeable, because they feel real. So, it's easy to connect with the story and enjoy the humor. I loved this film, and can't wait to see what else the creative team at everlight films will come out with next! It's definitely worth taking a look at."
3,A so-so Ranma1/2 movie...,"Although this still has some humor, I thought that the plot wasn't very solid and just wasn't as super-high quality as most Ranma anime is.Poeple who watch this with lower expectations than me may disagree, but I wasn't exactly satisfied with the overall movie. Also, I didn't really appreciate the scanty outfits that all the girls had on for a good portion of the movie. (Of course, many of the boys might disagre...) However, the plot idea was considerably original and unique, except for the girls being kidnapped.Overall, it's not a really incredible movie, but it's not too shabby, either. It might be a good idea to rent this before you decide to buy it. Whether you end up loving it or hating it, you should still watch ""Nihao, My Concubine.""And when in doubt...stick with the subtitled versions! I've only viewed the dubbed version, but I usually watch the anime in Japanese (thus I am more critical of the lack voice talent), and this may have influenced my lower rating."
3,Damsels in distress,"My ten year old son and his (male) friend enjoyed this, but I (mom) was disappointed. We're all Ranma fans. One of my favorite aspects is the strength and martial arts skills of the female characters. Here, all the girls get kidnapped and wait for the boys/men to rescue them, which they, of course, do. What gives? Such a departure from the strong female characters in the manga and TV anime I wondered how much input Rumiko Takahashi had into it. If you like Ranma you'll like seeing the characters, but the outlook is sure disappointingly different from the manga & anime."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Oh, I'm sorry, I dozed off watching Ranma 1/2 the Movie 2: Nihao My Concubine. This movie really adds very little to the Ranma franchise. How many ""Anything-Goes-Martial Arts"" something-or-other contests must one sit through before tiring of this stale series? The first movie has more creativity behind it than this ""let's get the cast lost on a desert island and kidnapped"" cliche-fest. Teenage boys may enjoy this film only to ogle at the girls in bikinis, but anyone looking for entertaining anime should look elsewhwere. Now,if you'll excuse me, I'm lapsing back into my Ranma induced-coma....ZZZZZZZZZZ."
1,Lame excuse to show the female cast in dresses and bikinis,"First, let me clarify that Ranma 1/2 is one of the best and funniest anime/manga series that I've seen. One thing I appreciate about Ranma 1/2 in general is that it tells a remarkably good story with a great cast of characters for all its silly gags. However, Nihao My Concubine has a weak, scattered storyline with an unoriginal rehash of each of the character's personalities in a monotonous manner unworthy of Takahashi's genius (indeed, I am thankful to know that Takahashi didn't write this one). I got the impression that the production crew had no ideas for a plot, but just wanted to slop something together: getting the main cast together with the girls in playboy-worthy attire being the only premise. And as for the humor...I didn't laugh once.If you're looking for some quality Ranma 1/2, go for the 1st TV season (subtitled of course), or get the manga (comic books). I couldn't stop laughing through those."
2,Predictable and boring,"I agree, a waste of time. Predictable and boring. I skimmed large sections and just read the ending. Forget this one."
1,Wasted my time on this one.....,"Dantes Relic: Archaeologist Cammie discovers an old relic.. She touches it and unleashes two men. One good and one evil. The good one - Dante is now sworn to protect Cammie and the relic from Damien the evil one. I lost count how many times Cammie ran from Dante. While reading this you would think to yourselve, stupid girl Dante is trying to help you and he's a hunk so why are you running. The book repeated itself over and over again. She would have sex with Dante then run from him trying to escape him just moments after. She never trusted him but she would sleep with him. The details of that were not all that good or graphic. Damien the evil did not come into the book till the end. This made no sense. I am not sure where the author was going with this book. I forced myself to finish this book so i could write the review.Not an Alpha-male read. They spent to much time running from someone or each other to do anything else."
1,"Poorly written, hard to follow the story","You could read every other page in this book, in fact I recommend it, as everything is repeated three or four times. The characters are wishy-washy and inconstant, the plot is slow as molasses, you find yourself wondering what the heck is going on as the characters stumble from page to page with no direction. The narrative is nonsensical and impossible to enjoy as you keep saying to yourself ""Huh?"""
4,Look Around the World.,"This book illustrates to young children that our world is filled with patterns. Almost anywhere you look, a pattern can be found. On animals, clothes, plants, quilts, and many other things patterns are inlaid. Some of the patterns discussed and illustrated are stripes, rows, polka dots, stars, plaid, ripples, stars, and various shapes. A good book that helps introduce young children to the mathematical design of the universe found in everyday life."
5,I really like Ray Mears,I think the book is really well put together. Great illustrations and photos. It is a great companion to his television programs. A lot of great common sense advice from an outdoor pro! Small enough to travel.
4,A classical introduction to actuarial science,"In my opinion this is the best introduction to those people who expect to understand the actuarial science at a first glance. It develops a series a principal concepts and explains them very easily. Though is old it will always be a classic. Remember. Fantastic for introduction, but if you're looking to get deep in actuarial calculus look for something else."
1,Here it Is - the First DVD Party Record!,"This is the worst vocal DVD released so far.The Das Lied von der Erde is risibly dramatised, with performers who can neither sing nor act very well, and a reduced orchestration which hurts more than it helps. The Kindertotenlieder is a straight concert performance with somewhat better singing, but again the orchestra is reduced, sounding more threadbare than focused.Buying this awful DVD is a priority only for those who can stand unintentional humor for more than a full hour at a time. If you think the joke will wear thin for you before the hour is up, stay away.This DVD has no business in international distribution - it will be taken seriously only by family and friends of the performers."
1,A mercedes driving self proclaimed god who's oral sex was broadcast on Indian tele.,"I'm glad people have found something here. But, where it goes - oh dear. He's the only ""swami"" who is also a kind of porn star. Google his name. You will come up with the articles in the Indian press of his television spot. Don't you just love this guys. Give up all your worldly possessions to be holy - oh and give them to me. A con man."
3,Amusing....,Amusing that this guy was ARRESTED for doing the very stuff that he proposes solutions to in this book.A charlatan of the highest order. (Three stars for his hypocritical ways being at least entertaining)
5,Life Solutions to the most common problems,"As the title suggests, the book guarantees solutions to the everyday problems. In this book Swami Nithyananda clearly explains the seven chakras, the emotions and the glands connected to each chakra. He also gives meditation techniques for each chakra."
5,A must read for every one,"""This book has changed our lives completely. It just made us clear the root of day to day problems. When we started applying this knowledge we realized the life becoming more and more blissful. We literally started a new life after started following the principles given in this book. If you want to live aconflict free life, this is a must read."""
5,"""You could teach writing."" I replied, ""I'd rather teach peace.""","Not finished yet, but it already merits five stars, easily. This dedicated teacher's journal of his efforts to further education in nonviolent conflict resolution a.k.a. peace studies is a must-read. Every page is a gem."
5,"Life, Death, Gangs, Drugs and Loyalty","Hinton gives an excellent viewpoint from inside the life of high school, juvenile delinquents, the ""Greasers"", that feud with the popular kids, the ""Socs"". The characters in ""The Outsiders"" carry over their problems into ""That Was Then, This Is Now."" Set in the 1960's, both novels deal with life issues such as drugs, peer pressure, gangs, etc., which someone of any age can relate to. These are the type of books that a reader doesn't want to end. If reading the books aren't enough, both have been made into excellent motion pictures. The best feature of both of these novels is to know that the author, S.E. Hinton, is a WOMAN!"
5,Hidden Pleasures,"Although I bought this CD as a Junior Wells fan, and was definitely not disappointed by his performance, the real joy came from finding that the supporting musicians were nothing short of phenominal. Guitar player Kenneth Britt especially shines, so much that I want to know what else he did and where he is now. Douglas Fagan on sax, Willie Monroe on bass, and Bill Warren on drums all turn in stellar performances. Buy this album to hear Junior Wells live at the peak of his form, but the real pleasure is in discovering and listening to the supporting musicians."
1,I noticed a definite left tilt as well.,"After having spent a semester taking a class requiring this book, I definitely noticed a rather liberal-leaning bias throughout most of the text. One of the obligations of national government, as stated by the text, is its ""matter of fact"" attitude that more wealthy individuals owe it to ""impoverised"" people through literally ""taking money from more wealthy states"" and giving it to poor states. Give me a break, there is so much socialism and liberal drivel in this book it made reading it a headache.Profs and teachers, PLEASE find something a little more objective than this textbook. Sheesh!!!"
1,Leftist propaganda not science,"This book presents the issues in a twisted manner, and never teaches fundamental values. It does not discuss at all the Declaration of Independence, does not give nearly enough historical background and generally mystifies the foundations of American politics. The meaning and value of the Electoral College is not explained nor compared to the structure of the Senate and House. Well if that was mentioned it would tell too much. Instead you get the usual leftist posturing, ""uh - it's so complicated - let us fix it for you"". The misery of this book is most evident in the discussion of the First Amendment - it is declared contradictory. Of course their interpretation is contradictory but this is what they like, so this is what you get. Once a conflict is introduced, the familiar soap opera style takes over. If you are not into MTV this book is not for you. BTW, editions galore and the price is definitely not ""for the poor""."
3,"Waveceptor - Great watch, no band options.",Great timepiece but you better like plastic watchbands because this watch doesn't use a standard band and noone seems to offer any options.
1,NOT waterproof,I bought this watch for my son 7 months ago. It stopped working 3 months after purchase when my son wore it in the swimming pool. Water went into the watch and it's NOT waterproof. Casio repair center fixed it (under 6 months warranty). But water went into it again 4 months later! This time they charge over $30 in order to fix the watch. Looks like this watch will cost you over $30 every 3.5 months. It's just NOT waterproof! Do not believe their product description. I give up on Casio and look for a different brand.
4,True feminism,"If only mainstream 'feminists' were more inclined to be ethically consistent like these women are, our society would be much better off. Mainstream 'feminism' is considered by many (including me) to be a ridiculous, philosophical sham by women who want rights for other women, yet simultaneously want the right to kill very small women. Abortion is perceived as THE issue for mainstream feminism. Not much has changed in the past 30 years because this is all that modern 'feminism' talks about. This work, being done in the mid-80's is a bit dated, but many of the moral and ethical arguments still apply. Definitely worth your time to read."
3,shed-solution,"My dog has been on Shed-solution for 3 weeks and as yet I have not noticed any difference in her shedding, the label states it may take up to 6 weeks so we are only half way through. One thing I can say is that our dog loves the taste of it over her food."
1,Does not work on my dogs,"I have been using Shed Stop for my dogs shedding and it works like a charm. I recently ordered this product, thinking it was shed stop- it is NOT. It is ""shed solutions."" Shed solutions is a completely different product with completely different ingredients. ""Shed solutions"" does not work for my 3 dogs. They are shedding constantly though they have been on shed solutions for about a month now. With ""shed stop"" I saw results immediately. It may work for other dogs, but for my 3 dogs, it does not.However, the company has been great to work with, thus far. They have responded quickly to my messages and seem to want to please their customers. I just think they should change the product image to accurately reflect the product description."
2,I have not noticed a change,"I am on my second month of this product, and I have not seen any difference in shedding for my 2 year old yellow Lab. I am sure the vitamins are good for her, but I will probably stop when I run out, and just buy vitamins. I will say that my dog loves this stuff. I put a couple of tablespoons on her dry food, and she gobbles up within a minute. She loves it."
2,limited information,"If you're looking for a lot of background on muscle physiology or a very specific method of stretching this book might interest you, but if you're looking for a good selection of stretches, you should be aware that you only get 6 stretches here. I found the title a little misleading, since ""every sport"" would seem to include tennis, baseball and swimming, but this book only addresses lower body flexibility. If you want to stretch your arms, back, shoulders, etc, you're out of luck here.I also found it annoying that the author promotes his personal stretching theory while using outdated studies to discredit other methods. For example, he uses studies from the early 70s to prove that PNF stretching is bad for you when the PNF stretching theories in use right now were not even developed at the time of the studies. Seemed like he was selectively choosing among the available research to prove his point while disregarding accepted theories that don't bolster his own method."
3,Interesting,"The information in this book is interesting, but like the title, a little stark. It left me with more questions than answers. However, having said that, it is short and to the point (if a little repetitive) and informative in that you can implement the stretching advise pretty easily. I have found several of the stretches very helpful."
3,pretty good,it wasnt the one i was looking for i wish amazon would put a better dicription so you could better tell the episode you want.
1,Disappointed,The only reason we opted to pay for this episode was because a friend of a family member was supposed to be in it - and she was - for about 20 seconds and then they didn't show her again. Very disappointed and wishing I hadn't spent the money.
4,A personal view of a forgotten chapter of the 20th Century.,Frank Tinker was a US Navy pilot that hired on as a mercenary with the Republican forces in Spain during their Civil War in the 30's. The writing is not world-class but the recounting of history is. To read the book and then to find out how he ended his life is the stuff of a great story.
4,Good coverage of the Fort Rock area.,"The information in this book is somewhat dated due to new discoveries, dating methods and understanding of Stone Age peoples in the Great Basin. I live in South Eastern Oregon so I am very interested in Eastern Oregon. I live about 70 miles or so from Fort Rock."
2,Lead actor is awful!,"Hard to like the movie because the lead actor must be a stage actor because it's as if he is standing on a Broadway stage.He's movements and speaking is so over the top that you can't enjoy the movie.Farrow and Walken are great..but, the lead actor who plays the character Abe is really bad.I don't know why Soldhonz would cast him...did he not give him a screen test?"
4,Perplexing,"I was enjoying this movie a lot until one of the characters told the central character, 'You had every possible advantage'. I thought, what? The main character here is overweight, balding, unattractive and has no social skills. Talk about DISadvantaged. So after that I couldn't understand the tone of the film - it lost me.I think the writer director is trying to discuss the American Dream and examine the fact that most Americans are excluded from achieving it. It is interesting that Americans BLAME these individuals for their failures and refuse to consider the political realities that have led to the situations they see, and in this sense the movie is the story of a murder. But it is the tone which is the problem here, since I don't accept that the central character had any chance at all in life and he is not to blame for his outcomes."
5,Fine Primer,"I can't pretend to be any sort of expert at jazz. It's only in the past several years that I've taken the plunge and listened to more jazz and discovered artists that I like. Wayne Shorter is one of those; a jazz great by any standards, yet one who still doesn't get the accolades that he deserves. If you're fairly new to his music, as I was, this is a great collection to start with. Most of it feaures his Blue Note recordings from the late 50s through the early 70s, although as the above review points out, there are some interesting live tracks from a 1986 album called ""Power of Three."" This 2-CD set does not include any of Shorter's work with the fusion band Weather Report, but that's okay. This collection alone has some great music, highlighted by Shorter's sultry sax playing."
1,Very disappointing,My husband and I are big fans of Stephen Colbert but found this Christmas DVD very disappointing. I would not recommend it.
4,Good,"This special makes me feel like i'm in high school again, when I used to concern myself over political issues and I didn't miss a chance to watch The Colbert Report and The Daily Show. It was only 4 years ago, but it feels like an eternity ago in some aspects. This special isn't quite as funny as I remember it, but worth purchasing nonetheless."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"Three ardent Colbert fans settled in for what they expected to be an enjoyable show of witticism and incisiveness applied not to politics this time, but to Christmas -something that would poke intelligent fun, leave us thinking slightly differently about something we care about, and feeling entertained in the process. We were all let down. This is one of the absolute worst videos any of us has seen. The plot is simply awful and the highlights werenon-existent. It left me wondering why Colbert would reach so low and why he would have agreed to have such a bad bad piece of work go to market. It would not be exaggerating to say that a group of not particularly talented second graders could have written and delivered an equally good or better show."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This was the worst piece of negative, mean spirited trash I have ever seen! I couldn't get it out of the house fast enough! I'd give it negative stars if I could."
1,"Awful, crap!","What's with Colbert's ""ironic"" selling of this on his show? Doesn't he have enough money? I do think Colbert is funny sometimes but this special was just plain awful. A send-up of bad Christmas specials? It WAS a bad Christmas special. Colbert has a group of drones with asperger's who will of course come on here and give this an awesome rating and make it the #1 DVD on Amazon. They have nothing better to do. With a wink and nudge to his drones Colbert has amassed another million dollars with this DVD."
5,Hilarious,"This is Colbert at it's best. A satirical look at Christmas and all it's traditions with some talented people to help him out. If you like Colbert, you will like this CD."
5,So happy I own this,This is a great special and I think it only aired once on Comedy Central. I'm glad I was able to buy it so we can watch every year now.
3,Colbert Christmas,"Being an avid Colbert fan, I was very disappointed in this attempt to be funny. I think he was out of his element. Worse was the series of trailers that came before the video. Truly gross! I had given several copies of the video as Christmas prsents and feel that I must spend time apologizing. You can do better, Steven!!"
3,Not Stephen Colbert's best work,"I am a huge Colbert fan, but this special was not worth buying- I doubt I'll watch it more than one."
3,"Good concept, but not a great episode.","This was a great idea for a Colbert Report episode. Unfortunately, it got a little boring half-way through. It had some really funny parts and some great songs, but it started to drag very quickly. The whole concept of Colbert being trapped in a cabin by a bear was pretty entertaining, and it had some hilarious guest stars. However, this episode was not funny enough to hold my attention for too long ( I did watch the entire thing, but I probably wouldn't watch it again)."
3,Not up to par with the high expectations I had for him,"I love Stephen Colbert. I really believe he can do no wrong. I was so excited to watch his CHristmas Special. I was pretty dissappointed with the content. The boots Stephen wore saved the show. I am not going to say I didn't enjoy it because I am a hardcore Colbert fan, I was just excpecting more. Read his book if you are dissappointed with the Christmas special. I did thoroughly enjoy the jap at the ACLU. . . I knew it would be there!!!! Hope his nativity scene isn't stolen this year!!"
2,Very Disappoined,"I'm a big fan of Cobert, but this DVD wasn't worth the money.Should be R-rated for references to MJ & sexual situations.The only good skit was with Jon Stewart."
4,It's all about the music,"The music is the best part of this DVD, so do yourself a favor and download it from iTunes. The artists, all talented singers in their respective genres, poke fun at themselves with witty and subversive lyrics. The music is cant-get-it-out-of-your-head catchy, and the production values are first-rate.The bonus track ""Cold,Cold Christmas"" is one of the better cuts, but ""Please Be Patient"" and ""Have I Got a Present For You"" are instant classics for the hell-bound atheists among us.The video portions of the program... I didn't find quite as hilarious. But they are still far better than almost anything else on TV, and they are vintage Colbert. So if you don't like it then you simply don't ""get"" Colbert.Or put another way: if you ""get"" Stephen Colbert, you will love this DVD."
5,Freaking Awesome,"This special was brilliant--it was hilarious and I definitely recommend it to everyone. I still can't decide which part was my favorite--perhaps the title, or maybe the two stockings on the fireplace, one named Stephen and one named Colbert. I'm still laughing."
3,Modestly funny and enjoyable despite flaws,"Firstly, I rented rather than buying (it is seasonal, after all). I regret, though, that Toby Keith (creepy song, creepy dude) will get a fraction of a penny from the rental cost; but at least I didn't spend 20 bucks on it. Does Keith even realize that Mr. Colbert's ultra-conservative persona is a complete put-on? Perhaps not; after all, he surely thinks George Bush was a good choice.Anyway, the show could have benefited from fewer songs and more skits, as well as widescreen and hi-def. It already seems outdated in this respect, much less how it'll look years from now. In any case, it's definitely worth a look, if not repeated viewing. And the extras are pretty good. Day 2 on the Advent calendar was spot-on. (Yes, as a renter I had to zip right along thru the 25 days.)The Best of the Colbert Report"
1,Avoid this sundazed edition!,"This new sundazed vinyl edition sounds horrible, Dylan's voice is devastated by cracklings when high-pitched.This is just a bad pressing, because there ain't no stains or scratch on my record, and my audio system is quite good. Purchase the original vinyl or the remastered CD instead!"
1,pissed off,I didn't received the correct item. I was sent a cheaper version of the product. It was acutally the one pictured next to it.the glass stap on. I called the company several times but never got a answer.I left several voicemails but never got a call back. I even emailed the company but didn't get a reply. It would be nice to get my 10 dollars back that covers the difference of the two products. No more amazon shopping for me.
5,My children loved this story and remember it after many years.,"This is a sweet story and the illustrations are accomplished. A warm, non-scary Halloween mood is invoked thoughout. If you're looking for a way to get children in the spirit of a fall harvest holiday, this book will to the trick."
5,No more paper cuts,"Cold, dry winters + paper = papercuts. I put a stop to them long ago with Eucerin. You don't need to use much, and it really helps to use it right after washing your hands so the moisture is sealed in. Now my hands remain soft and cut-free!"
4,Great Drive that's cheap,"If you are looking for a harddrive that can increase space for an mp3 collection or just have another OS installed, this is the drive. I enjoyed its ease of use and thorough instrustions for installation. I loved the drive for everyday purpouses. I think it is a 4 star item."
5,Lots of space for a good price,"This hardrive tripled my old amount of space on my work computer. This was an excellent hard drive. it is faster than most older hard drives at 5400 rpms. if you really want a fast hd then i suggest a 7200rpm hd. but this was sufficient for me. 13.6 gigabytes is a huge amount of space to fit all of my important information as well as all of my games and other stuff. I like most things to be external but with a hard drive i think that that is stupid because you dont put anything in it and it just takes up room and clutters up space, that is unless you want to transfer it between different computers(which could be nice and save money on like a superdisk). but I think this was a good purchase."
5,Best sunscreen around,"I have lupus and have to be really cautious in the sun. My dermatologist recommended this product, and I love it. It's not sticky or pasty. It feels like it really nourishes my face when I put it on. It's the kind of sunscreen I really don't mind reapplying during the day. I have very sensitive skin, and this is perfect for it. Try it. I bet you'll love it, too."
1,Face cream,Given all the great reviews I was disappointed in this cream. It was heavy and left my greasy. The SPF smell is horrible. Cause me to break out and made my roseaca flare up. I could probably use this as a cream for my hands when going to the beach but that's about it.
3,ambivalent,"This moisturizer is OK, but I find it a little greasy. If I use it very sparingly it's not too bad, and I think the oil does soak in after it's been on your face for a while. Overall, about the same as most other lotions of this type. Will probably try something different next time."
5,love this,I have tried everything from Neutrogena to La Mer. And this is the best. My dermatologist recommended it and I willnever switch again.
3,Nothing special for me,"This lotion didn't irritate my skin or do any damage, but I thought it was nothing special. It created a greasy film on my face that I had to blot off and cover with powder every morning."
3,Not Great,"Hi - I am a 36 year old black woman with extremely oily skin. I actually like my oily skin because I don't have many developing wrinkles at all. However, I have adult acne which I absolutely hate and I shine like crazy all the time. Guess you can say its a love hate relationship. Anyway, I purchased this product because many earlier reviews said it was great for oily skin. It did not cause my skin to shine, but it did clog my poors and cause a breakout. So it's not great for oily skin in my opinion. Also, it made my skin feel odd, leathery instead of dewy. I did not like it at all. Everyone's skin is different so try it if you have money to slurge. If not, then keep searching. Good luck!"
4,Great Moisturizer,A friend of mine recommended I try this moisturizer to help my skin during the winter. I've been using this for about 2 months now and my skin does have more moisture without feeling greasy. My nose would always peel and feel rough during the winter months but this year I haven't had any of those issues. I will continue to use this product into the summer and hope for good results then. I just wish the tube was larger.
1,Not happy,"The comments on the plastic say it is hypoallergenic. However, the product irritated my skin on the first usage. I never used it again."
3,Larger than i thought. works ok...,"The dimensions for this device are 3.5"" x 2.5"" x 6"" and the antenna telescopes out to 9"". I purchased this for the crank function which takes approx. 60 seconds for a full charge which lasts about 10 minutes (though the manual says 20 minutes.) The plastic used to construct this devices seems solid. The sound of the built in speaker/amplifier gets distorted after 1/4 turn of the knob but its loud enough at that setting.The reception is decent and since i only listen to one station the analog tuning doesn't bother me.It came with a little leash which seems perfect for strapping it on a belt.Its good for what i wanted it for, a walk around the block so i can listen to NPR..."
4,Has All Their Hits,"I suspect the Nino Tempo & April Stevens enthusiasts are small in number, and probably all over the age of 55, but if you liked their music, you'll like this CD. They had a unique sound and only did songs that were old even then (1960's). Deep Purple, Whispering, Sweet and Lovely, etc., were hits in the 30's to early 50's. My only complaint is that the sound fidelity is not that great. This is not uncommon on oldies songs, but I'm guessing they could have been re-mixed better. Surprise treats are a couple songs that weren't top 40 hits of theirs: their version of Tommy Dorsey's ""Who"" and their version of ""Honeysuckle Rose."""
5,Great style! Great sound!,"Nino Tempo has such a unique sound when it comes to arranging and producing his music, his name needs to among the other innovative music producers in music history. This disc has a collection of songs a century old, and he and his sister April give the tunes a whole new fresh sound. Deep Purple was the biggest hit from these two albums, but there are many more that are just as good! The ""All Strung Out"" CD has a whole different sound of it's own. Nino played a lot for Phil Spector's records, and you might think this other cd sounds a bit like Spector, but not really. Nino put rhythmic grooves to the songs whereas Phil always just kept it pretty straight. You'll dig Nino and April's sounds!!"
4,Nostalgia,"Great price, good fidelity, slightly uneven recording volume, good shipping service. Satisfied.Tom Easley"
1,Picks up radio stations,"I like these food series pedals. Many of them are good working pieces that do their job, but it's still hit or miss. This is a MISS. Did an OK job at compressing, but for a few weeks during rehearsals we always wondered where the hell we were picking up the radio station that was coming through our sound system. Then one day I forgot to turn it on, and noticed that as soon as I did, the radio kicked in again. EMBARASSING. I ditched this pedal quick and got a real one."
4,Transparent compression at a great price.,"For electric guitar, I prefer the squashed sound, so I use a modded Boss CS-3 for that. The Danelectro Surf and Turf is a much more transparent compressor, though, and I use it mostly for acoustic. It is one of those pedals that you don't realize is on until you turn it off. And for that purpose, this pedal does the job admirably.My problem with Danelectro pedals is the housing. Behringer -- another maker of cheap pedals -- also has plastic albeit sturdy enclosures that are practical, and much more pleasing to the eye. I don't know of anyone who likes Danelectro's 50s design (which doesn't even make sense for some of their effects, such as their distortion pedals. And I can't imagine that anyone enjoys the tiny knobs.For the sound and price, I highly recommend it if you're looking for transparent compression. For the housing/design, I absolutely do not recommend it for frequent live gigs unless you leave it on the whole time."
2,OK for messing around...,"These pedals are tiny, which is cool... I guess. The problem comes as soon as you try to use them at any kind of volume that competes with drums in a real band. At that point, you will likely realize as one of my bands' guitar players did that these pedals generate a lot of noise, and aren't too professional sounding. They are also quite flimsy; if you jumped on one, it would crack the case. They're ok for jamming in your bedroom at that kinda volume, but I would really steer clear of these for any band/studio work."
1,Cold Heat Soldering gun,"I should have realized that this was not a good item. This Cold Heat Soldering unit is just that--COLD. It will not even melt solder which melts at 750 to 800 degrees. I went through four brand new batteries trying to solder a small piece to a jewelry item, as shown on TV. The batteries got hotter than to work! Bad, bad to buy and I am sorry I did. I want a full refund, or should I say a refund for a FOOL?"
1,dont Buy this,"got this at Home Depot for doing some things on my computer. I got it and the very, very thin solder that they did not say you needed and I had to go to 4 different places. Then as I got home I sat down and started soldering and it would not give me a good joint. Then as i put the soldering iron into it's case furious that i only made a half decent joint the tip broke as I was puting into the section just for it.Go get a normal soldering iron. It may be less safe but at least it works."
1,"-good idea, bad execution","-i wanted to hard-wire two car cd players, so when i saw cold heat, it sounded like a good idea. i thought i would give it a try. well, getting it to work was another thing. in a nutshell, it was useless. the tip is a two-prong affair which requires that both prongs must be contacting the wire. this is somewhat awkward as the tip basically eats itself up, so if one prong becomes shorter than the other, it becomes difficult to maintain contact. when i could make contact, it would not even melt the thinnest of solders. went out and bought a basic soldering pen for half the price from radio shack, and it worked just fine. save your money on this one. get something that works."
1,Wish Amazon Would Allow Zero Stars,"This tool is totally useless at this point. I tried it for the first time today and, well, nothing. It wouldn't even heat up. For 1/2 hour so far I've tried my best to ensure that both sides of the tip are in contact with my wire, my solder, and finally with both at the same time. Still nothing.Further, the battery compartment requires a tiny, but strong Phillips screwdriver to remove two tiny recessed screws. Why would they not make it more accessible?Don't waste your time on this product. Even if it worked for a few, why take the chance yourself? The odds are probably that you'll be disappointed."
1,Not Good for electronics,"1. Electronics use very thin solder, and the space in the tip that has to be bridged it too large for this.2. This device works on electric current, not just to generate heat, but throughout the tip as well. This shorted a few things in a project before I realized the cause, tested, and verified this."
3,It works if you know how it works.,"This tool absolutely does work if you understand what it's using to solder. It's an electrode separated by a non conductive material so both parts of the tip have to touch your work for it to activate. Here's a video of me using one to work on the gauge cluster that stopped working on a Dodge Caravan (the solder comes loose on these regularly).[...] I know it's not a high quality video but it makes the point that this tool does indeed work. At the end you'll see the plume of smoke.The best advice I can give anyone who purchases this tool is to NOT ABUSE IT. The tip is a carbon substance which is brittle. It doesn't take much force at all to activate the tool. Once the red light comes on it's doing it's job, don't push any harder it won't work any faster."
1,Piece of rubbish,I ordered the tool and it did not solder one item. It does not melt the solder but melts the tip on the tool. I sent it back and they stated they would refund the shipping charges but lied and never reimbursed me for the shipping charges. DO NOT BUY THIS! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!
1,Cold Heat NOT SO HOT!!!,"I purchaced the cold heat to carry in my RC car and slot car toolbox. I tried to use it on several solder joints,wire to wire, wire to deans plugs and wire to motor tabs, it failed to do anything other than arc and vaporize the copper wire. Kind of like trying to solder with a tig welder. The split tip is very delicate and replacements cost as much as a new cold heat. Overall I found it to be good for not much of anything I am returning it for a refund and buying a new butane powered soldering iron."
1,Don't waste your money,"Worst product I have come across. Other then soldering some very fine wires (22AWG) it is useless. Tip is very brittle and generates very little heat.I own several soldering stations, and on occasion need to solder in the car. Thought this would be ideal so I would not need to drag an extension cable out. Well, not so.The product works by shorting the two halves of the tip with solder/wire and arcing across to melt the solder, however it can hardly build up any heat with a fresh set of batteries. Also, if you plan to use it as a source of heat to shrink tubing around the wire or melt plastic, you can forget that, as that cannot be done."
3,"Great for casual use, mediocre for serious use.","This isn't a replacement for a high-quality soldering iron. I wouldn't recommend using it on computer components, the tip is too broad. Maybe the fine tip helps, but I can get a good iron for the same price as a single tip. You also have to clean it about every fifteen joints, otherwise you'll have trouble getting it to solder.Since it works differently from other irons, reading the instructions is a must... But the instruction booklet sucks. The website has a pretty good tutorial, but the booklet needs to be improved.That said, it does its job pretty well. I use it most when I'm working on wiring for audio and car applications. Since it cools down relatively quickly, I was able to work where a butane iron would've been a fire hazard. I'd recommend it if you just need something for the occasional repair or portable work. But if you want something for serious use, go with a regular soldering iron."
1,Absolutely Worthless,I can't believe that anyone could consider this a decent soldering iron. Cold heat is a good name for it because its all I can do to get a pathetic cold solder joint.
1,Junk,I do a lot of soldering but this piece of crap it just that. Save your money and get a real soldering iron. The TV ad is pure Bull****!
1,Junk,"We never did get this thing to work. Ooopps - I stand corrected, The LED light worked. We tried using this with various light weights and grades of solder and it never did a thing. I'm reminded of the old saying, ""If it sounds too good to be true, then . . ."""
1,Don't buy this,"This thing MIGHT work on 20% of the things you might use a soldering iron for, but even then only if you get good at working around its limitations. Get a real soldering iron. This product is so awful I strongly feel its advertising is fraudulent. The highest credible rating on here is 3 stars -- for a reason (the couple that go higher than that sound like they were written by the infomercial writers)."
1,Cold heat stinks,"I bought this cold heat piece of junk because the description sounded really good .. I tried it and could barely melt solder.I should mention that a piece of the tip broke off too! Unreal. What a piece of dreck! A red light comes on to tell you it's soldering but I held it to the ""pot"" with some solder..and held it, and held it.. and held..... instead of holding it and not melting anything, hold onto your money."
1,JUNK,"I just took it out of the packing and tried to use it. It worked for 10 seconds, then part of the plastic around the tip melted. I stopped using it, then was going to take the batteries out of it so i could return it, and it was hot to the touch. My batteries melted inside of it. After an hour of it sitting there ""off"" it was hot to the touch. JUNK!!"
1,Wish I would have read reviews first...,"Junk. I spent 20 minutes trying to effectively use this thing being experienced with conventional soldering irons. It just wouldn't stay ""hot"" long enough to melt and arrange a sufficient amount of solder. It's not feasible to keep the 2 ends in contact with the solder at all times (which is what is required to keep the current going to generate the heat). I ended up with a bunch of tiny balls of solder that I could do nothing with. Thankfully I bought it locally (on a whim) and you can bet I'll be returning it first thing tomorrow."
3,For small joints only,"I bought mine at Radio Shack, where they sell it under their name, after reading a few reviews (not at Amazon). I'd hoped it would be a good field tool for soldering crimp-type connectors, coax, etc.In short: It's not. This is a tool for small connections only. For small PC board work it's good. For tinning stranded wire- no. Coax connectors? Forget it.I also thought it might make a good first soldering tool for my 11 year old nephew, in that if left on it wouldn't start a fire, and if dropped it probably wouldn't result in injury. The jury's still out on this one, but I suspect it wouldn't be a very good beginners tool.Resistance irons such as this one have been around for a long time, particularly for tiny work, because they can localize the heat to a tiny area without damaging nearby componants, and the Cold Heat iron is still a good choice for much of this sort of work. But as a general purpose iron it just doesn't deliver."
1,You should drop the product,It does not work on any real size wire. Amazon if they are interested in customers should drop this product
1,Huge waste of money,"This thing really sucks. The tip is as brittle as pencil lead, and a new tip is $10. You will break it. I haven't been able to get a clean solder joint yet with this. I switched back to my $10 plug in one. Don't get it you will be dissapointed."
1,Coldheat is a waste of money,"In addition to all of the problems above in the other comments, the tip breaks very easily so you have to be extremely careful with it. Replacement tips cost almost as much as the unit itself."
1,Worthless,"Spent about an hour trying to solder 2 wires together and could not even get the supplied solder to melt. Cheap design and the tip started chipping right away. Like all other seen on tv products, this is a gimmick and thank god for money back."
1,Tip broke before i could even use it!!!!,"I got this for X-mas and took it out of the package to inspect it and had accidently bumped it on a table and the carbide tip broke off....lol. Went online to see how much a new one would cost and it would be cheaper to buy a whole new item at the store. $10 for a single tip replacement...give me a break!!! I work at Home Depot and we sell these crummy things for $9.97. By reading alot of the other reviews for this product at least i'm not alone in having the brittle tip break off and finding it frustrating to buy a new one. The reviews also said that this product doesn't work for beans anyway, so i think i'll take my time in getting a new tip. Maybe i'll wait another 4 years until they drop the price or sell all the tips in a set for $10,THEN it will be worth it."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"I must qualify that I am not a mechanic by training but enjoy doing a lot of the work in our cars. That said I found this manual disappointing in that it really does not offer any kind of help in the maintenance of the car for people with little mechanical training. By ""Service Manual"" I understood that there would be detailed information of how to do certain things like working on the AC components, transmission, etc, that is more that just changing your oil. It is not there!. It just gives you pictures of part by part components with little descriptions of procedures. I can get the pictures in the Internet! going to a bookstore does no good because this is one of those sealed books until you buy. I just did not like it and will sell it as soon as I can :^("
3,Good manual but could be better,"The manual has detailed descriptions on how to take elements apart, but when it comes to codes it let you hang. I have a series of error messages which are also spelled out in the book, but it does not point you to the faulty part.It would be a good idea to have an additional section which points you in the right direction based on the error codes.Overall I would recommend the book since there is nothing better out there."
5,Beetle Manual,The manual was clear and to the point. Finding information was not hard. The book had more info than I though it would.It was layed out nicely too.
2,I like the Haynes format better,"This bentley book is basically an exploded parts diagram, with alot of footnotes referenced to each separate part. This book is fine for factory techs, who've been schooled in detail on the car, but for the home user, it leaves alot to be desired. I like the Haynes format better, in that they walk you through a procedure, instead of just giving you an exploded parts diagram. Also, some things are just missing from the Bentley, and you still have to scratch your head for an hour, and search their huge book, before you realize you have to just figure it out for yourself. I think the book could be alot better, especially due to its high price and large size. One positive, is they list the fault codes in back, but you can find even better lists of the DTCs online, so you don't need the book to read the codes. Please, Haynes, write a manual for this car! I'll buy it!"
3,Volkswagen New Beetle: Service Manual,"good manual for the average joe. It's lacking real detail on components, Injection pump"
2,You can do better.,"This book is short, and lacks much in the way of substance. If you want to read about this historic disaster find a book better suited to the topic."
5,A good historical account of the famous fire in Boston,A nice account of the Cocoanut Grove fire which included much background about the victims and also incorporates the official report form the Fire Marshall to help the reader to know exactly what and why it happened and what happened afterwards.
5,"The Cocoanut Grove Fire, Without Hysterics","THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK ON THE COCOANUT GROVE FIRE. THE AUTHOR, STEPHANIE SCHOROW, WAS A REPORTERFOR THE BOSTON HERALD FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. MS SCHOROW DID EXTENSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH SURVIVORS OF THE FIREBEFORE WRITING THE BOOK. SHE ALSO TOUCHES ON THE DISASTER THAT TOOK PLACE IN 2003, A ROCK BAND'S INDOORFIREWORKS DISPLAY THAT KILLED ROUGHLY 100 PEOPLE IN RHODE ISLAND. MS. SCHOROW'S EXPERTISE ADDED A LOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.I PURCHASED THE BOOK AT AMAZON.COMCHARLES C. ENTWISTLE"
4,feels the same as it did before,"I have always been a kiss the sky fan. I had lost my earlier copies, and decided to replace them. Boy does it bring back memories. Great product."
5,Everyone should read this book!,"I have been searchng and reading spiritual material for over a half century and this book has gotten me so excited! It is truly one of a kind, as is Michael Tamura. I have purchased this book for several of my friends and family members as I want them to have the info Michael conveys. It is so important to have this information at this time in our spiritual development on the planet. And Michael is an excellent writer. There are many instances where his prose is extremely poetic in its simple beauty. I highly recommend this book. You will read it over and over and over and over."
5,Stellar,"Martin Middlebrook's work is typically well-researched and detailed. His narratives are not too shabby either. His attention to detail allows the thinking reader to meticulously reconstruct the battles. If you want to know about U.S. daylight bombing over Germany during World War II, there is no better place to start."
3,"Read the first half, and skim the rest.","This book plays like a made-for-TV movie on the Sci-Fi Channel. The story has great potential in the beginning, but lackluster characters lead the way into a mundane action filled ending."
2,Scary? Sometimes. Good? ... not really.,"I was truly disappointed with this book. It started well, with a truly creepy premise, but soon became nothing but a bore. I'm giving it a two for the original premise, but it lost a lot of points in its rather lame explanation, the lack of answers for many questions, and its long, drawn out conclusion. Good for a creepy read - just don't expect much more."
3,Good start but ran out of steam,"The story grabbed me at first and was interesting, but then later it suffered from being too lengthy and turned into an action-fest instead of atmospheric horror which was present in the first quarter."
2,"Darkfall, aka, The Big Dud","Another boring horror book that relies on cliches to propel the story, especially the 'troubled cop who contemplates suicide over the loss of his family'. Ugg. Not again. The style is also boring, as it basically only follows one main character throughout the story. This linear storytelling seems old, not like the more modern and fast paced storytelling of, say, Michael Crichton. Stay away from this book, you'll be glad you did."
4,"Tight, Lovecraftish tale","Laws, one of England's best kept secrets, finally has a title released in the states! Loaded with bizarre creatures, gore, and a really good explanation for what possibly could be the cause behind all general ""hauntings"", DARKFALL is a sure fire hit for fans of intelligent horror. Hats off."
3,Just barely decent,"I was not frightened by this book. The first few hundred pages are interesting despite the constant shifting POVs, but the end is a chore to reach: long and drawn out and just plain dull. The explanation for the Darkfall effect is confusing and not very scientific, so much as a horror novel can be scientific.Publishers Weekly's claim that ""this absorbing tale is also a spot-on allegory for the quiet horrors of cubicle life"" is completely and utterly ridiculous. Whoever wrote that statement hasn't read Darkfall, hasn't worked in or even seen a cubicle, or is smoking crack.I felt that I wasted my money buying this title new. It's worth about $1.00 at a used bookstore, however. Just don't expect to be scared, even reading it at night in an empty office building."
3,Martial Arts From Down Under,"Australia's first martial arts film (a co-production with Raymond Chow's Golden Harvest) delivers a steady stream of colorful action. Director Brian Trenchard-Smith keeps the mayhem moving while utilizing picturesque locales ranging from Ayers Rock to Stanwell Park. Kung fu star Jimmy Wang Yu lacks charisma but performs some impressive stunts - leading to an explosive showdown with the memorably villainous George Lazenby. ""The Man From Hong Kong"" (1975) is a vigorous cult classic and a must for Lazenby completists."
2,Plays like a parody of a 70s action drama. Very silly.,"Wall to wall cliches. An Australian/Hong Kong production with a former James Bond as a villain, martial arts choreographed by Hung Kam Po (Sammo Hung), and vehicular mayhem by Grant Page (who did the same for Mad Max a few years later). This almost plays like a parody of a 70s action drama. A very silly movie."
5,sbrown3417,I haven't been motivated to write a review for a cd until this one. I bought it when it was first released then again recently because it was worn out and its that good. I went to Key Club in Hollywood shortly after this cd was first released and the dj played this cd from begining to end pretending he was mixing and blending the songs in. My favorite trance cd.
5,Stunning Piece Of Work,This is by far the best mixed cd that ive encountered in a long time.From first track to last non stop.Brilliant
1,Never got out off the start-line: Taken for a Ride???,"Dont know if the seller of the game that copied it from TalonSoft missed something in the copy, but the game does not work properly after trying to play even your first day; crashes!The box-art is pretty though!If Talon-Soft was to maybe re-manufacture a genuine game again, I would maybe be a sucker enough to re-purchase it. For the time being, seeing I bought this thru this site, via one of the ""reputable"" vendors remaining nameless, I dont really know how life could have been."
2,Not bad...not good either!,"Each chapter starts out well. But, the author begins to lose his reader due to either his unclear explainations (talking in circles) or just missing a step or two with his statements.Also, I have found a couple errors in this book. For example, page 63 regarding 'Variable Scope' and page 67 (Questions section) #20 is incorrect.It's a ok book if you have a idea of object-oriented programming, but I advise this is not a good book for the absolute novice in programming!"
5,Much Better than Oreilly series or Javascript Bible,"I worked on databases and programming languages like C and PL/SQL. I bought the much acclaimed Javascript Definitive guide as well as Javascript Bible. If you try to learn Javascript from above books - ""THE BURDEN IS ON YOU TO LEARN THE JAVASCRIPT "" i.e., the authors don't really give good examples or decent explanations to explain the concepts clearly. But ""Javascript comprehensive"" book has very good examples and will walk you through every line and bottom line is "" AUTHORS HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGHTS AND DID TERRIFIC JOB IN MAKING OUR LEARNING PROCESS MUCH EASIER"".I am really looking forward for books on XML from the same publishers. Keep it up !"
2,"Either I am inept, or the book is","I'm taking a JavaScript class using this book, and it is probably the worst textbook in my 3+ years of college. I have learned almost nothing from it, and have had to search the Internet for better explanations of the concepts I am supposed to be studying just to complete my homework.One problem (among many) is that it seems to have been poorly edited in going to the third edition. It seems they may have rearranged some of the content in the chapters, but left the assignments/projects in the same place so that when trying to do a project, don't assume everything you need in the book precedes the assignment.If you are taking an online class and this is the textbook you are stuck with, you'll want to look for additional help online or with a better book. If you're interested in learning JavaScript on your own, start (and finish) somewhere else!"
1,Very difficult to comprehend,"I was forced to buy this book as a textbook for my JavaScript class and looked forward to learning the language. The author seems to know what he's writing, but assumes that you do not need everything explained. There will be numerous examples instructing the reader to type lines of code to build short programs, but the author neglects to explain how each line is actually affecting the program. I went out and purchased ""JavaScript for the World Wide Web, 4th Edition: Visual QuickStart Guide"" and used it often when I needed further and better explaining of terms."
3,Not the best book for JavaScript,"I agree with some of the other reviews in that this is not the best book to learn JavaScript without any prior knowledge of the language. I am using the book for a JavaScript class, but I am having to supplement it with other books on the subject. Gosselin's explanations are not that clear, and I am finding myself lost at times."
3,A good book,"This is a well written book covering (almost) all areas of JavaScript. A lot of excercises and MCQ's are also available. But, beware of some printing errors."
1,This book (...),"Do not buy this book!!!i read the whole book and did the exercises, there is a of mistakes in it, even in the excercises. the book looks pretty good when you read the preface, however, when you read the content of it, you will lose your way.do not expect you can learn much from it."
2,Calphalon 1.5qt Saucepan with Lid,The lid is not the same as shown. The lid is made of anodized aluminum. The ad shows a stainless steel lid.
1,"Folks WIth Lanolin Allergies, BEWARE","Although my doctor recommended this product for a severe outbreak of eczema (the worst I've had in over twenty years), the supposedly non-reactive lanolin in the lotion caused a major case of contact dermatitis. (Which I haven't had since trying Keri Lotion to treat the last major outbreak....) IMHO, if you're in any way sensitive to lanolin, stick with either Aveeno or Cetaphil."
1,Poor packaging,Even though the bottles were shrink wrapped in 3's all the shrink wraps had loction leak into them. I had to wash every bottle off. I would guess I lost about a 1/2 a bottle of lotion out of the dozen we ordered.Very poor packing tehnique this time. The first order we got wa fine. Not so with the 2nd.Joe Hart
3,An expensive addendum to the Infini-D User Manual.,"The book has some interesting tricks and tutorials, but really should have been implemented into the Infini-D user manual. For two Specular employees to charge money for this is a little crazy."
3,Solid concert from Muddy Waters band alumnus,"Let us not take for granted the solid, no-frills, blues artistry of Chicago's Mr. Luther ""Guitar Jr."" Johnson - he's the real thing in an era of teenage guitar ""sensations."" When Johnson (now the pride of New England) is ""on,"" as he shows here, he's one of the tastiest guitar pickers around. Better still, he has developed into a top-flight singer. This is a welcome re-release of what had been a rarity put out by the club itself. It also marks his first solo live release. His studio work with Rooster, Bullseye and Telarc labels is probably the better place to start, but this is a decent live snapshot of a fine performer."
2,very slow and somewhat disjointed,"Act of Violence seems to go on and on and on but not much ever happens. Granted, the first 25 pages captures the readers attention, eagerly awaiting developments in a potentially exciting plot. Then the story takes an abrupt turn into another story line which never connects very well with the first 25 pages. The end of the book is unsatisfying because we really don't know what happens to the characters we've been following. Does Oliver fall for Midge? Do Sarah and Oliver re-cememt their marriage? Does Kevin go to prison? Does Oliver leave his law practice to repair doll houses? And on and on. A disappointing read."
3,"Right pan, but a couple things wrong","12-inch non-stick Cal Comm pan would have done the trick but it arrived (promptly) with a couple defects: 1) An all-too-noticeable machine line at transition to radius (spatula would catch on it), and 2) Three or four raised/marred areas on bottom that made for poor contact on our ceramic top stove. Handle does seem a little more on style and less on ergonomics.Returned it (Cooking.com - great service people, no problem), but contrary to what was said when we had sent it in, there were no more to exchange. Did get it at significant sale and probably should have kept it, warts and all. Two other C-C pans doing well."
1,jr. college handbook,"If you are looking to read, forget this one. 100 pages( 50 of which illustrations) of under sized print, not to mention its inordane shape left this book without a chance from the moment I opened it..."
5,Very high quality,"I bought these here through Amazon and am very impressed with them. They are very heavy, with excellent connectors that have a tightening feature for a solid connection. If you need a subwoofer cable, this is the one. Cheers."
