3,Was not a tension packed read.,This was and will be the last book I read from this author. I'm was really getting frustrated getting to the end of the story.
1,Less than the best,Something lacking in everything. Not worth the effort of listening and certainly not worth purchasing. I want a refund!
4,The Cool Ruler Has Done it Again!,"Yes! Gregory Issacs has done it again. Live at Maritime Hall is a great CD. This CD features most of the Cool Ruler's romantic music ""Live"". What more could you ask for?If you like Gregory Issacs, then you must get this CD."
3,Ok,"Most of the information is great. Some of the information is dubious. I found some of the works cited to be faulty. One of the studies cited by Tanembaum was about how women and men did on a math test. The men and women were separated again into those in regular clothes to those in bathing suits. I found this faulty because men can lounge around in shorts. Women don't always wear their bathing suits to just lounge around. It was implied that women didn't do as well in bathing suits, compared to the regularly clothed women, because of self-esteem issues. I doubt that that is what is the real reason for the results. I'm a psych student and the results could have only suggested that that is the reason along with many others. It's hard to be definite in psych. Those type of assumptions give psychologists a bad name."
3,started out a little tough to read,"It started out tough to read, her book [...] is a much easier and more engaging read"
5,The Great Organ of St. Patrick's,I have purchased this CD in hopes that it is half as exciting as actually standing in St. Patrick's listening to Mr. Dumler in person playing the Toccata & Fugue. I had the pleasure of this only four days ago. There are no words to describe the experience. I have heard no other organ that can match this one. I have heard the organs in the Duke Chapel and Salt Lake City.It truly shakes your bones and rattles your sole.Need I say more?
4,first four books,these are the first four books in the series. they are okay but some of B.Bryant's are better. although you want to read these to know what is going on in later books I liked them but the plot was not realy very deep or interesting
3,Strange title for a sex book!,"With 75% of America on a diet at any given time, it doesn't take much to figure out why the author chose to name her book, ""diet"", but this misleads the consumer. This book is NOT about dieting. IT is not for weight loss, it is for improveing your sex life. IT insults the intelligence of the reader to draw you in under the premise that this book will help you ""diet"". If you want to improve your sex life, you will enjoy this book. However, a better book, that doesn't need to mislead you to get you buy it, is ""Secrets for Men"" by Sharon Colona. The sexually inexperienced or those lacking in creativity in their lovemaking or personal care, will benefit from it. If you want to lose weight,this is not the book you are seeking."
1,CRAP,I got sent a book that was priced $73.00 through Amazon. And when I got it was used and some of the pages were ripped out and stuck in the back of it. And it had a price tag on it from a used book store for $7.00. I sent amazon an email about it and they told me I could send it back but they would charge me 20% for the return of the item. I say they ripped me off.
2,NOT THAT GREAT!!,"The problem with this book is that it is mostly testimonialabout how great this book or rather this ""diet"" is, only about a third of it is for you directly. If you want to read testimonials and realize that not everyone has great sex all the time then hey buy it, otherwise put the money somewhere else, There are some fun things contained in the his and hers sections but it is a very small portion of the book!! We found it to be an overall disappointment."
3,"Full of promise, but ...","This would be a great book, if only it wasn't so fraught with errors. For example, p15 shows equation for 'mechanical lever' to actually reduce the output force from a given input force - this force would actually be increased greatly over the input force. While the text otherwise indicates this correctly, the transposing of smaller diameter symbol with larger diameter changes the meaning.Unfortunately, there are too many more errors in the book to mention here, as space doesn't allow. A frustrating read, not reliable for an everyday reference. Hopefully an errata, or 'mea culpa' new edition will come out soon. Not worth the price of admission currently - don't buy this one!"
3,Feathers fall Off,"While it is very pretty and fluffy, and looks great too, the feathers fly off the boa and get everywhere. I had to clean it all up on two different occasions because the black feathers got everywhere. It is a lot fuller than some of the other brands out there but with how many little feathers fly off I don't know how long that will last."
2,caveat lector,"Stubbs' book of interviews with contemporary American documentary filmmakers may be useful (even inspirational) for those new to the field, but the author doesn't know her turf. The volume is filled with minor factual errors: film titles are misspelled, interviewees' self-serving statements go unchallenged, and proofreading errors abound. Clearly, Stubbs was learning as she went along, and editorial oversight was minimal.For better or worse, the book reveals the enthusiasms of a novice. The interviews are superficial, and somewhat adulatory: the writer seldom takes a critical or analytical view of the filmmakers' assumptions and methodologies.The book may appeal to beginner film students looking for easy-to-read interviews with Ross McElwee and Berlinger & Sinofsky; there are much more informative interviews with Al Maysles, D.A. Pennebaker, Barbara Kopple, and Ken Burns elsewhere. Caveat lector."
2,Poor Book Quality,"Juran Institute is the standard that quality is based on in the industry. With great anticipation, I waited for this book. McGraw Hill the publisher should talk to the institute. The diagrams are probably the worst I have seen in 20 years. They look like they were copied on a dirty copy machine. The paper used for the book is poor and the typeface is huge. Frankly, I surprised that the Joran Institute would agree to publish this book with such poor printing quality."
1,Wrong color!,"This is polished brass & chrome, I was expecting chrome only. This was not properly indicated on the site at the time of purchase."
1,Don't Buy,"I am 5'8"" and 185, I worked out with this for only three days before it broke. The plastic ""stem"" that holds the bag broke in half. Before that, I had it filled with sand and it would move. This is a good product only if you want to hit lightly."
1,no good,"I just got this today and was very disappointed. One of the bolt threads was missing so water kept coming out. It was also ridiculously hard to put together. After an hour or so of struggling I got it together just to find out it was very wobbly and didn't have enough weight to stand still. The bag also fit very loosely on the stand. After hitting it maybe 50 times the thing literally broke in half. I'm 6'5"" 235lbs. and I hit really hard, but still, it shouldn't break no matter how hard you hit it. Not recommended at all..."
3,"Not a professional bag, but OK for the price.","I take Tae Kwon Do and bought this bag to practice. Assembly is a bit of a pain and the design of the foam inserts does not provide a nice finished punching/kicking surface. The bag is fine for light to moderate kicks and punches, the design of the foam assembly creates some softer spots than others. If I were in the market to purchase a similar item again, I would spend up to $100 more to get a better quality bag, but for the price it serves its purpose."
4,Best Freestanding Bag I owned,"I had the same experience that the dude before experinced with the whole sliding around the carpet thing, but the screws on my bag are still going strong after hitting the bag everyday for months. I even took it apart to see if the screws were digging into the plastic & there were no signs of ""digging,"" since there are rubber sleeves that go over the screws to help protect the plastic from any of that. As far as the performance of the bag....I love the whole spring action thing it's got. The workout you get on this bag is better than a regular freestanding bag due to the spring action. The combonations you can throw on this thing are phenomenal and you don't have to worry about it tipping over after your power punch. Nothing can beat a hanging bag, but this is the best alternative especially if you live in a small apartment or a dormitory like me."
4,Freestand,"Any bag that doesnt have a stand will not be perfectly stable without movement. Just the way it is. So if you think you can by pass this point, than forget it. But if your looking for a bag with a little more freedom to move because of space or living arrangements than you will be happy with this one but you got to remember its freestand.The biggest debate is water or sand? does it really make a difference? The best tip I can give is not matter of which one but what's under the bag that helps the most from keeping it sliding on the floor when in use.When considering water or sand.... water is easier to empty out than sand but sand doesnt evaporate or get moldy.If you have purchased this bag and your not happy because it is freestand, than forget the freedom of movement and fill the base with cement, there's an answer for everything"
2,"Not worth it, period.",To say that this bag was a pain to put together would be putting it lightly. It moves much too much. It makes way too much noise when you hit it. I cannot imagine having this thing in an apartment. You would be evicted.
2,terrible.,"I had this put together for an hour and the thing literally snapped in two. I am a 125 pound female. That is ridiculous. Screwing the screws and washers in was one of the hardest things I've ever done, and I've birthed children. The padding was about 8"" too short to ever make a seam while putting it together, and once on, it never stayed put. I was concerned that I'd break my foot when the padded bag moved up with every kick. Maybe I just got the crappy one in the shipment, the one with halfassed parts or something, but I returned it and I will not buy another. I'm moving on to a Wave master."
1,terrible product,"Assembly was a bit of a pain, but nothing too serious. Once it was assembled, however, I discovered how worthless this bag was. It took about three punches to move it a foot; I expected some movement, but this was unacceptable. Worse, there is virtually no resistance to my strikes. I might as well be punching air. Some reviewers praised it for its ""spring action"", however, this is not a good thing. It doesn't get your body accustomed to the stresses punching puts on it. I don't expect perfection from a freestanding bag, but this bag is extremely weak in all areas."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought my free-standing heavy bag at a local store and I was very excited to try my new product. When I got home I was in for a shock. There were at least sixteen screws, locks, and washers in a little bag. In addition to that, there was about twelve additional pieces that needed to be put together. All in all, it took me about two hours to put this puzzle together and eventhough it weighs about 275 pounds once it's filled with water, it does not take much to move it around when striking during a workout. I need to keep readjusting the base back to its original position every three to four punches I throw on it. For the amount of money that I paid, this bag should have been put together for me. I will keep the bag and put it outside. If somebody steals it, they will be doing me a favor. Next time I will go with what I know and buy a wavemaster from Century, now that is an awesome product!"
1,A plastic piece of junk,We bought this bag for our 100 pound 14 year old and it lasted one day before the plastic collar broke rendering the whole thing useless.It is not easy to put together either. It took two of us to stuff the foam into the bag so that it did not leave creases and indents.We are returning it and won't be ordering another.
2,It's not for a healthy full grown man,I don't really consider myself all that powerful. But managed to punch/rip it off by shearing from the base of the water filled weight. If you are a light puncher or just looking to tap at something it will do OK. Otherwise you'd better off for the real deal ceiling mounted heavy bags.
3,Stand Alone Bag...currently stands alone in my closet,"It is quite durable, but moves and bounces up a bit when punched...you'd be better off buying this if you do not live in an apartment, or have a place where you can use it without disturbing in-laws. I filled it with water and put 4 cinder blocks around it, and it continued to wabble; maybe it's just because I filled it with water, and not sand, and sand's density is greater than water's. It is designed to feel like a real punching back though, and it does meet that standard. If you have a sturdy place where you can put it, buy a hanging punching bag for maximum workout or training."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this bag for my husband after weeks of his shopping around and trying to decide on a bag. He finally chose this product because of the known name as well as competitive pricing. He excitedly opened the box and began assembling the product. First of all, the thing is a pain in the neck to assemble and the instructions not at all helpful. Secondly, within two hours of assembling it, it busted. The stem, what holds the bag, is actually three seperate pieces that are a pain to assemble and apparently cheap plastic. My husband isn't exactly Rocky and only purchased the bag for a fun core workout that would also be a good stress release. If he was able to bust this product I would hate to think what someone who actually trains could do. My advice: don't waste your money, spend a few more dollars and buy a quality product."
1,Unsatisfactory,"I'm 5'10"", 185 lbs. My very first time using it, I got all of a 3 minute workout in before the stem sheared off of the base, leaving the threaded portion nice and stuck in the base itself. The bag flew right across the room and into my laptop.... Luckily the bag itself isn't terribly heavy and my laptap was undamaged. But seriously, what kind of heavy bag system can't take a heavy hit?On top of that, it took quite a bit of time and elbow grease to force this thing together. Apparently the pieces are manufactured using only approximate measurements.I'm thinking I'll try this Century Wavemaster that some of the other reviews mention.This product absolutely does not live up to Everlast's reputation."
1,piiiieece of...,"i'm 6ft tall and weigh 140 lbs. my parents bought me one of these for my birthday and after a couple of weeks the piece that connects the bag to the base cracked and it was no longer usable. so i returned it from another at the same store where i bought it and the inner foam piece with the knobs was too small to fit around the stand like the instructions said. so again i exchanged it for a third freestanding bag and it broke in the same place with my FIRST kick. For me to get two defective or poor quality pieces and poorly written instructions really got on my nerves. i also have the problem where it slides on my carpet, easy fix but wouldnt be necessary with a soft rubber base. they should reallly, really R&D these things a lot better before selling them and causing me to lose faith in a long standing and supposedly reputable company. everlast isnt getting another dollar from me. enjoy your recession."
1,rubbish,oh my god album is as bad as his playing was at the market barsorry jim but you just havent got the gift
5,The Wildest Dream,"This movie is well-researched - it is a MUST for Everest afficianados, but is also historically interesting to Everest newbies. Kudos on a great experience."
5,Everest...,"George Mallory was truly a legend and a pioneer considering what he achieved 75 years ago. He attempted to conquer the unknown which is much different than achieving the same when there is so much info available to hikers not to mention tools of comfort. In this documentary, you get the chance to see more of Everest and learn that human body behaves differently at a high elevation regardless how capable of athlete you may be at sea level. Beautiful shots of Everest that I had not seen in other Everest documentaries. Bravo."
2,NOT REALLY WORTH YOUR MONEY,If you are looking for rare videos and pics of sandy and george you have come to the right place. I was under the impression Anker was willing to climb everest with the same gear as Mallory.This did not happen.Which I am happy about.Only a total nut would attempt to climb the second step w/o the ladder and hob nail boots.Overall great for more info and videos of Irvine & Mallory but certainly not worth the price of admission.This was more about Anker climbing the second step w/o the ladder while at the same time showing some respect for Mallory and Irvine.It is a woderfully romantic idea to believe mallory summited everest but I do not believe they did.Too many factors going against them.Rent this or borrow it.
5,AMAZING FOOTAGE!,"This is a great movie. The vintage footage is amazing and the story of a man driven to find out more takes you into a world of mountain climbing that is unimaginable. I have read books and watched movies about Everest for decades...this tops them all. If you have ANY affinity for Everest you MUST watch this. Two human dramas parallel each other...the first that of Conrad Anker and his life changing find of George Mallory, dead on Everest 75 years after his fateful summit attempt; the second that of Mallory and his own drive to top the monster of all mountains. The quality of the film is unsurpassed. Some of teh Climbing scenes will leave your heart beating out of your chest!***EDIT***Just watched the blu ray version and it is STUNNING! I had seen it streamed through wii in the past, but got a new 47 inch LG (also reviewed) and ordered this in blu ray because I knew it could be potentially fab. IT DID NOT DISAPOINT!!!!!!"
4,Fairly funny,If you can imagine furry teddy bears that can think but also take everything as gospel then you should like this book. The scenarios are based on old Earth fairy tales and fantasy stories the the inhabitants take WAY over the top.
5,Beautiful harmonies,"If you're looking to explore Scottish Gaelic music, this is an ideal CD with which to start. Mac-talla is a gathering of some of the finest Gaelic traditional singers. Their collaboration here is thoughtful and incredibly beautiful, especially on songs where they all sing together in harmony. 'Togail Curs air Leodhas' really stands out. If you like this CD, you will not be disappointed by the individual CDs by members of the group. I'd also recommend that you check out Catherine-Ann MacPhee (not in this group). However, one can only hope that there will be more Mac-talla outings in future!"
4,Just what I was looking for BUT...,Just what I wanted till I saw the Price. OK get real here. There is really nothing about this set to make it this expensive. I would say $40.00 would better fit these lights.
4,Best for rugs,"They work well over carpet, but are a little noisy over tile.They require a Philips screwdriver to install, but one isn't included."
3,A bit misleading,"Just received my order - since they are shown in pairs I assumed that the price listed was for a pair. When I ordered 4 I assumed I was getting 4 pairs. I was really surprised that I got a total of 4. I have looked over the description again and if it says this is the price for one, I'm still not seeing it. Still an okay price compared to buying locally, but we go through these pretty fast."
4,Item being reshipped,I submitted a review last night saying the item wasn't received in total and I had called for a replacement which hadn't arrived. This morning a representative called me to let me know a replacement is being expedited to me. I appreciate the quick response and customer service.
1,Inferior product,"On the first use of the walker glides one of them broke up inside the leg. They were too brittle for the South Dakota winter temps. So if you live in a place where the temps can go into the negative, this product is not for you."
4,"Walker glides (""skis"")","Anyone who needs a walker to get around should try these, what I call, walker skis.(walker glides) They really do glide over most anything and make the walker and the user (my wife in this case) a lot more comfortable and secure when using these simple but excellent devices."
1,Very High Shipping Fees,"I have purchased this item several times through Amazon; however, it was through a different vendor. The shipping for 2 sets of these ski's was almost $20.00, which is 4 times what I have paid with previous orders. I would definitely order this through a different Amazon vendor."
1,Disappointed customer,"I ordered the walker gliders for my mother's walker, but when they arrived, they were too small for the walker leg tube. I notified the seller, and they were wonderful about helping me. I gave them the Walker brand and model #s and they sent me another set that still didn't fit (still too small). Then they gave me a number to call so that I would get the correct item, but when I called, I was told - they don't have another size and that I am now responsible for shipping both items the one I ordered, and now the one they sent to replace the original order) back. Not a way to win customers."
3,rough wooden handle,"I purchased this knife because of the length of the blade, which I needed for slicing large round loaves of home made bread. I also assumed that the brand name would be reliable. So far, I have owned the knife for a few weeks and it does slice fine, but the wooden handle is not nicely finished and feels rough in my hand. I may try to condition it with some boos wood chopping block oil, although, I'm not sure that this is a good idea- to make a knife handle temporarily slippery while the oil soaks in completely."
4,Well made,"This knife is very well made. It is a quality product. My only reservation is that it's somewhat long (which, of course, was in the product description but I didn't pay attention.) I'm hoping that it will serve me well for many years."
2,Walnut handle needs sanding and polishing,I was disappointed with the handle since it was ragged and I wondered if it would splinter. I have several other knives from Chicago Cutlery and have never had this problem. It cuts well but I expect that I will have to finish the handle.
4,Great bread knife,"I bought this knife to replace a 20 year old one that I adored. It is almost as good as that one, and I have tried a dozen knives in hopes of finding the perfect replacement. This comes as close as I can get, although I still miss the other. It's not too heavy, which for me is good, and it cuts through bread like butter. It's a little more dangerous than my old knife, since it is really sharp, but if I am careful it will do the job. Still miss my other one; lighter weight and bigger serrated parts so it wasn't as dangerous, but as I said, I'm pretty happy. Funny how people can get so attached to a knife."
5,Fantastic,This did the trick perfectly. I never had one before and struggled with not being able to cut my bread in slices without losing a lot of delicate pieces. Well this worked great and it also fit my budget. Thanks.
4,Chicago Cutlery serated knife,I bought this knife knowing I wanted a serated one and so far am very pleased with it. The blade is longer than I thought it would be but that hasn't been an issue. I like Chicago Cutlery and have several other pieces. Will buy more if I need them.
5,Excellent Bread Knife,"Purchased the Bread knife for my Mother. She said it works great, was exactly what she wanted. She uses it to cut fresh bread out of the oven and it does not crush the bread. Good price on the knife compared to other sites."
4,Does the job nicely,"Other than in summer months, I bake all the bread that's consumed in my house, so I cut a lot of bread! This knife does a good job, and looks like it will last a long time. I've even been able to make perfect cuts on bread just minutes after it's out of the oven. (I know that's not recommended)"
3,Decent knife for the price.,"The quality of this knife is good for the amount of jack. This knife will tackle any soft breads and cakes with ease. The one problem that I have run into with this knife however, is that the widley spaced teeth can be troublesome when cutting hard crusty breads. Since the teeth are widley spaced, it is prone to skipping if you are not careful. In short, skipping knife blade = sliced fingers. This is problematic to me since most of the bread I bake is rustic/french style bread. In all fairness, this knife has multiple purposes, but if you are looking for a good knife to cut those lovely baguettes you've been laboring over so insatiably, go with something with smaller teeth."
5,Best bread knife since unsliced bread,"This is the knife you need to slice your bread. I wondered why my old knife and new breadmaker didn't get along. This knife solved the problem. You get nice, clean, even slices of bread with this knife. For me, it is the nicest thing to happen to make even, sliced bread, a reality in my kitchen."
4,Excellent general purpose serrated knife,"This is a nice, relatively inexpensive serrated knife with a blade long and sturdy enough to allow it to do more than just slice bread, which it does with ease.Warning: The teeth on this knife are a little on the coarse side, so If you intend to slice delicate items such as pastries or smoked salmon, you may want to look for a knife who's serrations are finer."
5,Everything I was hoping for,"The knife is everything it's advertised to be. It is very sharp, cuts through the crust easily but does not tear the softer interior of the loaf.The handle is nice looking and comfortable.I've never used or owned a bread knife before so can't give a comparison.The price seems to be a good value. I'd recommend to a friend."
4,Excellent Product - Screwed Up Shipping,"The Chicago Cuttlery knife was excellent and exactly as expected. Unfortunately, the shipping was screwed up so it didn't arrive in time for my trip to visit the gift recipient at Christmas so the gift was late."
2,cuts crooked,"The title says it all. I have another bread knife and it cuts straight. I have used other bread knives and they cut straight. This bread knife is nice and sharp but it wants to cut a wedge, such that the bottom of the slice is way thicker than the top. I figure the other knives that have know problem pretty much rules out operator error. For me a cheap price for a cooked cutting knife is not a redeeming quality. I guess its better than an expensive crooked cutting knife though. Either one requires the same amount of hassle to repackage and return. Onther note, in my research for the perfect knife I have found allot of preference for a 10"" blade. IMO an 8"" blade is fine for a loaf up to 8""wide. And another One other note, I was disappointed to see it arrive in a box that could have easily fit 50 of these knives. (about 16""X12""X8"") Very wasteful for my green sensibilities. The packaging is not the fault of the knife of course. The product was from Amazon."
5,Great Bread Slicing Knife,This is a must-have for slicing home made bread. Was well worth the money. I had nothing like it in my collection of knives.
5,Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition 10-Inch Serrated Bread/Slicing Knife,Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition 10-Inch Serrated Bread/Slicing Knife is doing an admirable job. I like unsliced bread for some reason and this was the answer. It arrived quite quickly.
4,A BIT HEAVY,"Knife is a bit too heavy for a bread knife, but it does cut perfectly. Just be sure to have a light hand!"
5,Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition 10-Inch Serrated Bread/Slicing Knife,"This knife is very well made and has a beautiful handle. The handle should be oiled often to keep the wood conditioned. The slicing capabilities are terrific. It sliced through a soft french baguette with ease and without smashing the bread. We used it to slice through tomatoes with ease. I have purchased expensive serrated knives but, I definitely like this one much better."
5,Looks great. Cuts great.,"White bread, brown bread, bagels, baguettes...fingers. Might as well all be butter. This knife it not concerned with such trifles. What more can you ask from a knife? After buying it, you can still afford to buy bread to cut with it."
5,Wonderful bread knife,Originally purchased this knive for slicing bagels before freezing. Worked great and over 15 years we wore the knife out- literally wore down the serations. Was so pleased to find the exact same knife still being made and available on Amazon! I give this knife the highest possible rating for slicing any type of bread- it is a little long but works great if you have room for it in your kitchen.
4,Silver Ring,"I do love the ring, however, I was sent a garnet and not an amethyst. I didn't send back because of the shipping and handling charges. The ring is pretty but I did want the amethyst. I have received many compliments on it however. A good purchase for the price."
2,"Worked, but not Durable","I bought this device because I wanted to have a PDA and phone in one single unit. It worked well for a while, then the ear jack slot would not work. So I was constrained to use only the PDA function. Within about 6 months of use, I observed the battery would run down quickly. Presently, I cannot get it to come on; and I bought it early 2004. During the time it worked, it was cool, but it appears it cannot take the kind of rigors expected of such a device. Believe me, I am not a careless person."
2,AT&T and Cingular,I have had this phone for over a year. I paid about $400 for the unit. It worked fine and I had no problems with it while at AT&T. Cingular is another story. They do not accept this phone on their system and do not offer any compromises on their PDAs in exchange for my loss. Cingular could not care less about the AT&T customers they acquired. They even charge for activation into the Cingular system from the AT&T system.
3,Unlocking Palm Tungesten W PDA,"If you want to switch to different GPRS/GSM carrier for your Palm Tungesten W, contact BongoWireless (of Canada) to get your device unlocked for $100 - and you will be able to use your device to work with any GPRS/GSM providers around the world by popping in purchased SIM card inside the back of Palm Tungesten W. Also, please read Palm Support's email response regarding the AT&T; for USA and elsewhere in the world:Hope it helps. - RJR==============================Hello,Tungsten W handhelds sold in the US are SIM locked to AT&T.; The Palm Tungsten W is SIM card locked to AT&T; in the United States because of our business relationship with AT&T.;There are International versions of the Tungsten W sold in othercountries, such as the UK. These versions may also be purchased over the internet through certain companies. Please understand that these products are not supported in the US, though.Thank you,PalmOne Support Specialist."
3,Cell Phone Or PDA?,"If you are in dire need of a cell phone. DO NOT GET THIS DEVICE. I would never pay over 60 bucks for it either. These things have been on ebay for under 70 bucks for over a year now. Not just sold by individuals, but by electronics and phone stores for that price. Now, if you are wanting a PDA for under 100 bucks. This device is for you. True, you will not be able to use the cell phone feature unless you know how to get the unlock code, which can be done by the way. Just takes a lot of time on the internet and searching around. I have a cheapo Nokia 3130 I use for a cell phone. So that part of it doesn't really bother me. If you can find a PDA for under a 100 bucks that has the options on it like the Tungsten W. Let me know. I think it's a great deal just for that alone."
1,leesea,"Tungsten W is an obsolescent device and I DON'T recommend it for following reasons: 1)it is locked to AT&T which does not offer good GSM service in as many areas as other providers, 2)it has an older version of Palm OS4 which PalmOne is not going to update, 3)it has a slower chip running at 66mhz which is tied to the OS which has been superseded by new versions. The later two points make it not a good PDA.In addition PalmOne does not have good customer support and didn't even offer me a trade-up to Tunstgen C or Treo 600."
5,Refreshing and Endearing,"Lovely album by this great Welsh export. I certainly liked this one more than ""Blue Trees"". It's so whimsical and beautiful, it takes you to another world. Their songs can be cute and folky while incredibly moving. They've definitely grown up. As for selling out, I felt not one iota of that when I kick back and enjoy the nostalgia. This is the kind of CD I don't care how much it costs; it's worth every penny."
4,"should be 4 1/2, not just 4","this one here is super-produced sounding, which has its ups and downs, pros and cons. i like the expansive atmosphere it gives the band--it does these songs a great service, allows them breathing room--but i miss the living room folksiness of the earlier stuff.it's a beautiful album, longer than spanish dance troupe and the blue trees by a long shot, but perhaps not quite as endearing. regardless, this band is inching its way towards my top ten...i already consider them the biggest musical discovery for me so far this year."
3,"Necessary, but not great.","My humidifier won't run without one of these cartridges in place. However, our water is quite hard and the cartidge doesn't even begin to reduce the ""white dust"" that is emitted if I try to use filtered tap water. I have to use distilled water anyway. Someone who has softer water may have better luck with them."
4,I'm sure they are great!...but,"The install of these little items is one of the most difficult to install on my whole truck! Without special tools or as some have done, made up homeade ones, it is very difficult to press the old ones out and these back in. If and when I get them in, I will be back to edit this review. The shop told me that the stock ones were ""Shot"", but the labor to do them did not cross paths with the front suspension rebuild that I was having done, so it was an additional $600."
2,Different than before,"I read this book in grade school and remembered loving it, so with my new Kindle I decided to download it again. They changed it! All the dated references were changed to make it read like it's current. Instead, it just reads like a cheap remake."
1,Didn't like it at all.,"I wish I hadn't read this book, it was terrible. The narrative is first person past tense, so you know April survived. I think the whole witness thing was unrealistic, and so was the scene where April's trapped in the house with the hit man. The ending was predictable and not exciting at all. All April seems to think about are boys and tennis. Please, don't read this book. It just isn't worth it."
3,"well, maybe","This book is entertaining and has a clever plot. I am in 8thgrade and i think it is a very easy and quick read. Lois Duncan wouldhave had a better story if she went into more detail about a few points. There are some important pieces in the book that she mentioned and did not day much more about them. after i finished the book, i read the back blurb and it said that ""...the buried secrets surface."" I did not remember any major secrets that I thought were of any importance because Duncan had not explained them throughly enough. This book does not go deep enough for me. I would not recommend it. END"
2,thumbs down....way down,"How can I put this....I was SO disapointed. The ending was so anticlimatic that I felt like I was going to throw the book in the trash. The whole family was annoying and not very likeable, and I didn't really sympathize with the main character, either. The 'bad guys' were paper thin and not scary at all. They didn't have any individual personalities, so you couldn't really build up any resentment or fear towards them. They didn't even have the 'evil without a name--lurking in the shadows' feel to them. It was just...blah. I also thought that the girl's part in the ending was horribly lame. If you want something to pass some time reading, then buy this book. If your looking for ENJOYMENT or SATISFACTION in a young adult piece, try something by Richie Tankersley Cusick."
2,This book is NOT for 6th graders!,"This book is violent, some bad language & has some steamy parts that are not discussed on publishing websites that review the book.The characters are largely caught up in their own problems and whine and complain most of the way through the book, the parents to the kids.If you don't mind your 11 year old reading about a grandmother describing how it felt when a thug broke her arm or how they found a man shot in the head and stuffed in a closet, or a teen getting drunk from a punch called ""suicide"" then groped by a guy at a party with then you'll probably have not problem with this book.For 14 year old readers and up, maybe, but it's disturbing to me that classrooms with 6th graders are reading Lois Duncan books."
2,CRAP,"I hated this book in my opinion. It was boring and predictable. Not so great. I liked a few parts in the story, like when they were moved also given new identity and a new life that was why I gave it 2 stars out of 5 stars. I didn't like this book a lot because April(main character) made so many stupid mistakes that could have cost her life. In reality people people do panic under stress but in the book they over-exjurated. i read other books by Lois Duncan and it's the same mistake. I am not planning to read another book by Lois Duncan."
1,terrible book,"this book is terrible. i was forced to read it for my freshman english class. it has a slow plotline, poor character development, and just terribly written overall. the ending is stupid and pointless and completely unrealistic. do not put yourself through the aaonizing experience of reading this book. i had never not finished a book, but i was really close to just saying ""screw this"" and throwing the book in the trash. just go read harry potter instead, or if you want a book with suspence or mystery, read anything by dean koontz likeThe Taking. just not this."
4,the scoop on duncan,It is a story about a girl named april and her dad is in the FBI and they have to go into a wittness protection program so she has to leave everything behing including her friends and the hardest one her boyfriend steve. what will happen? this is a good heart throb/mystery book
2,Don't Look Behind You,"Don't Look Behind You is an amazing novel, written by Louis Duncan. A teenage girl was living the dream life, until one day, her father witnesses a crime. The entire family is then put into the witness protection program. The teenager and her family then move undercover to an unpopulated area to avoid any danger. Before they know it, their conver is blown and they are searching for survival. Will they make it out alive before it is too late?"
3,Dull 'Til The End,"I found that this book didn't get to be as suspencful as any of the other Lois Duncan books I have read before. I would like to recomend to anyone who is looking for a good book, ""The Twisted Window,"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". Both of these books kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through. The last few chapters of this book was the best part of this book. I only wish that it didn't take so long to get to the good part."
2,"""Not a favorite.""",The story of April when her family had to move with the Federal Relocation Org. was not a very interesting tale. It most certainly did not live up to my expectations.
5,Thrilling and Exciting,This book is an amazing book!!! I couldn't put it down. I recccomend it. I look forward to read other books by Lois Duncan.
2,not the best lois duncan book,the kindle vershion of this book has many errors. like no spaces inbetween some words. i also found it boring. there was no thrill like in her other books ive read. i wasnt thinking whats gonna happen next? i was thinking ok please get interesting. if you havnt read a lois duncan book before read a different one first. this is a dissapointment
5,A scary realistic fiction that will enthrall you.,"When I read this book, I expected to be just another fantasy that could never happen. As the book went on I realized how realistic this book was. Great for 12 year olds!!"
5,"Great, suspenseful story!!!!","I teach 10th grade English, and I have just found another novel to add to my teaching curriculum. I loved this book, and I know my students will love it too (just like the 9th graders LOVE ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""). Lois Duncan has a way of capturing your attention, even if you're a teenager who doesn't like to read much. I highly recommend this novel!!!"
3,Not too bad,"Well, I have read a couple books by Lois Duncan. Don't look behind was, in my opinion, the best one she's ever written and i gave her a 6. I suppose her books appeal to younger readers. I have found many holes in this book. For example i would imagine better security provided for the Corrigan family and i thought that Mike Vamp would be more thorough. It was quite unrealistic. I highly recommend one of Christopher Pike's older books."
5,Very Gifted Writer,"I read this book in seventh grade for a book report and it freaked me out. MY name IS April Corrigan. It is so odd because my name is not very common. I have tried writting to Louis Duncan, but the letter was returned.This was a very good book, which led me to read almost all of her other books. Louis Duncan is a very gifted writer, and keeps her readers in thrall."
4,A Great Value,My wife an are are infirmed. We eat our meals sitting in chairs. Not at a Table. The Table Mate II makes the caarae takers job of feeding us much easier. It is much better that eating off of trays. I know of no other table that brings your food close to your chest as you eat.
5,computer laptop holder,"This table had a bad review online, but I liked the legs out of the way design, so I bought it as a gift anyway. They were very wrong. It is great, well made and sturdy.Carl"
3,Ok for the price,I would like the highth to be about 4 inches taller. at $24 it would be a good deal but shipping boosts the total to about $34
4,Perfect!!!! But.....,Perfect for my needs. The only problem I have is the color. Really bright white. I have a Shep/mix and it attracts dog hair like crazy. Other than that it's sturdy and height adjustable. I'm going to order 2 more but this time I am going to order the wood grain version.
2,You get less that what you pay!,"You can say that you get what you pay, but with this table you get less! The table apearance is cheap and is not sturdy at all. I wouldn't recommend that you rest your arms or apply some force when you are cutting food, and is too unstable to place your beverage on it while you are eating. I'm using it to work with my laptop when I'm sitting on the couch and it works ok, but It's not confortable and wobbles when I'm typing. The high adjustment buttons in my table sometimes get stuck, and beside that the table is kind of high for a low couch. I bought an adjustable table (laptop table) before from a furniture store (the scandinavian one which sells unassembled furniture) and the quality, the apearance and the price were better."
5,Table-Mate II Folding Table - Very nice,I have been using this table for the past 4 months. I Was very skeptical before buying it..but it really fits the bill. It's very light but steady and the stand slides into the couch .Hold my laptop well.. U can also use as writing pad..
1,Zero wasn't an option,"Cheap, shaky, couldn't hold a drink or anything without spilling at the slightest movement, like setting a cup down. I have no idea if mine was a knock off or not, but had to return as it was completely unusable. Thin, cheap, not level, poorly packed and loose in the shipping carton when it arrived. Not what I expect from Amazon or an Amazon seller at all."
1,What a piece of garbage,"Hi there,,It is incredible how bad this item arrived at home I wish I had taken pics of it. The metal was rusted, the white plastic board was yellow of the rust it has! I was disgusting I never had that feeling when opening a new box!!!! QUality I do not know but in your home with cleaners and other stuff I do not think that piece of metaI will last..I saw the 4 stars and I went for it but for sure it is crap."
5,It works and I find it very useful,"I use this while watching TV with my iPad. Seller advertised one color but I received another. Easy to put together, sturdy and I find it a great table that makes using my iPad easy while watching TV comfortable."
4,Good for light to moderate use,I bought this for my 92 year old aunt who lives at home with a caretaker. She eats primarily at her chair because it is the kind that has a lift and can be set to the right height. It's reported that the tray is a hit. When I saw it I was impressed it has a cup holder that pops out to keep her drink glass secure. I would recommend it if you have someone who won't put a lot of stress on it as it is of a medium weight construction.
2,Really cheaply made,These table are of inferior material. The spring pin securing the legs do not engage the holes properly. The table support arm is weak and cheaply made. Alkl in all a disappointing product.dw
1,Table-Mate II COPY CAT,"RJ Quality Products sold me TWO COPY CAT Table-Mate II's.I had previously purchased one from Amazon and love it.The two tables from RJ Quality Products were made frominferior, far less sturdy materials. The legs were madeof cheap RUSTY metal and were not nearly as thick as the legson a real Table-Mate II. The tables would not sit level and werenot sturdy at all. Now get this, the box had a sign on it that says""SIMILAR TO AS SEEN ON TV"". Also, the real table mate II table saysthe name on the back panel of the table. These imposters do not.BUYERS BEWARE OF RJ Quality Products!!!!"
1,TABLE MATE A BIG DISAPOINTMENT,The Table Mate quality is much less then the commercial leads you to beleive. Very cheap and shakey construction. The clip that holds the adjustable height broke in the first week of use. You can not lean on the edge at all while eating and the top does not position flat so your plate will slide unless held. Do not buy this table. Its much easier to just take your money and toss it out the window.
2,"Nice design, but cheap materials and poor quality","Table top was not level when assembled out of the box (on two tables). I managed to bend the legs so that the table top was level, but I was disappointed with the overall quality of the table and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Unusable,Unfortunately there were no other reviews when I ordered this table for my 83 year old mother... the table's quality is poor and for her it is essentially unusable. I had hoped that she could use it when eating some of her meals (according to the product description) but it can't be adjusted to stand level. The plastic top is thin and was already warped when we received the table. Definitely not a good buy!
4,"Great laptop table, though not as portable","The Tablemate II is a good design, but has a few minor flaws. It's good for I've found many a use for it, from laptop table, to TV tray. The downsides is its lack of portability, and sometimes stubborn adjusting. For the home however, this table is a perfect tool."
1,Received an used one!!!,"I receive a used item!!! All the pieces are very dirty and full of scratches and stains! There's no plastic wrap and no packing slip. I can even see the dirty tapes possibly left by the previous user. Can you imagine how mad I was when I opened the box? This is the first time I was pissed off by Amazon. Actually I need to correct, this item was sold by RJ Quality Products Inc, fulfilled by Amazon. Is this the reason why I deserve an used table? Give me an explanation, Amazon."
4,NIFTY TABLE,"I was surprised after putting together (easy) that it is quite generous in size, not a skimpy little thing that you can barely get both knees under. Height is easily adjustable and can go high enough to be used over a bed. The tray is larger than most ""TV tray tables"" and large enough to hold even the largest laptop computer plus room to spare. There is a lip all around the outer edge of the tray to keep thing from easily sliding off. The only con, as far as I'm concerned, is that you must disassemble the lower part of the legs in order to make if flat enough to hide under furniture instead of simply folding them up. Also, be careful about leaning arms/elbows on the tray as I don't think it is strong enough for that. Overall I am quite happy with it."
4,A Useful Table,"I like this table. It could be a little larger, but I purchased it for my laptop, which is only 14"", so it works well for that. I love the side cup feature, and that the table is very easy to move in and out, and closer to you. You can adjust the table to suit your needs. I like that the legs you can move the table so that the legs go under the chair you are sitting in, so that the table isn't really sticking out.Before this I was using my laptop on the arm of my recliner, but everytime I had to get up for whatever reason, I would kind of have to balance my laptop on this small folding tray and the arm of my recliner.This table was easy to put together. It shipped fast and arrived in perfect condition.I think the price was good, and I feel I got pretty much what I wanted. This table will be useful for alot of purposes, should the need arise. It's not heavy to move, but it seems sturdy for my purposes, and easy to take care of.Iam happy with my purchase."
3,Good Enough,"This works fine for the light use I intended it for. It's not pretty, and ever-so-slightly uneven, but holds my coffee and book fine. It's also a bit stiff to push the buttons that allow the legs to collapse to store under the couch, but over all, good enough."
3,Too small for my needs,"I was dissappointed with how small this was. It was clearly marked with the dimensions, I just made the newbie mistake of overlooking that for the price."
1,Piece of junk,"This table is NOT the quality of the orginal. It had very flimsy construction, thin gauge metal legs, and didn't safely support much of any weight. A full dinner plate, glass of iced tea, and utensils and it got even more wobbly.I returned it almost immediately !"
3,Good utility table,"Bought as a gift, and so far, no complaints, it works well for her, she has a laptop and uses this as a tv watching holder of laptop ..."
3,Hard to adjust,Table is not very sturdy and hard to adjust height but once set up great for use by sofa for lap top or food when watching tv
2,Not to sturdy for a laptop,I bought this for my laptop. I loved being able to bring it right up to the couch and being able to work without sitting on the edge. My pens and mouse wouldn't fall off because of the ledge which is good as well. I keep my laptop on the left edge of the table and it didn't take long for it to starting bowing down in the center. I'm going to put the table upside down on the floor and use some heat to try and take the bow out. At least I could still use it for something less heavy. I went out and bought wooden tray tables to use for my laptop.
5,Very Useful,"We have been using this table since a year now and it has been another great buy on amazon. I use this to keep a hot mug of tea, to keep my laptop while sitting on the sofa or just keep misc items like remotes or books on it. Extremely sturdy and serves multiple purposes."
4,"Works well, but could be stiffer","This table is adequate for laptop use at a sofa. However, I would like to see it just an inch or two wider to better fit a mouse. The plastic table bends a bit and would be better if if it were stiffer."
4,Very happy but a little shaky!!!,"I bought this table to be my home desk for my laptop and its very good, its very light, it fits very confortable wherever I seat the only thing I've notinced is that it is a little unstable it seems as if the legs where a little uneven (but they're not) although I still think it might be the type of floor I have."
5,great product,"this is a really great product, I use it beside my computer desk to give me additional desk space while I study. it was delivered promptly and in good condition"
1,I am unlucky to receive a defective product,My bad luck is that i received a table that after few days of use curves. The position stays sagging once formed.
2,Warped table,"This table seemed like just what we wanted. Besides using it to eat on, we used it as a table for a laptop computer. After about 6 months the tabletop has become warped and is no longer level."
4,Convenient as advertised..,Works exactly as advertised - very convenient and easy to stow away.. I am using it as a table for my laptop while sitting on my couch - helps shield me from the extreme heat that comes from the bottom of my laptop!
1,Cheap imitation,I bought this and it's a cheap imitation of the real Table Mate II. The legs on the table were bent which caused the table top to not sit level. When trying to adjust the legs to even the table top it caused the table to then tip over. The adjustable heights don't have as many variations as the real Table Mate II. The quality of the materials is cheaper as well. This was an all around disappointment. I'd advise anyone to find another company that delivers a legitimate product.
5,Very usefull and full of tricks,"This was the best price I found for this model. It has all the adjustments of the tray angle, of the table height and the size allows enough space for both my laptop and the mouse. It has another trick that I didn't notice in the description or the picture, it has a cup holder that comes out from the right side. Really nice. I like to have any liquids at a reasonable distance from my computer. I also usually prefer to eat in the couch while I'm watching tv. This makes that easy and without the mess."
3,Portable and Easy to Setup.,"This table is very portable. Easy to setup. Easy to store and occupies a small space.But table is not sturdy enough, it is wiggly. Table top is a bit slanting, not really level. Very light, a little nudge and your glass will topple. The surface of the top can be a lot more usable if it is rubberized to keep the plates from sliding.Should be a good buy around 15$."
4,great table!,This table is great for my laptop. It's light and easy to move. It's the perfect height for surfing from the sofa in front of the tv.
4,worth the money,"I bought this table so my handicapped Dad could eat more comfortable. The table is easy to assemble, it is strong, easy to clean, has a nice table top size and folds to a convenient size for storage. My only complaint is, it is hard to fold up but I guess that is a good thing because it will not collapse easily."
5,Great Product,This is a great product. The delivery time was excellent. I would suggest the TableMate to any one.
4,not bad,"This table is as i expected it to be.The only problem with it that bothered me was that it wasn't as stable as i though it would be, also the ajustment to raise and lower it and to change the angle were not as easy to do as i thought they would be.But over all this is a great table to use while i watch baseball or football or use my laptop computer."
3,A little overpriced.,"The product works as advertised and is easy to assemble. It is a little overpriced, you want to make sure you use it often to offset what it costs."
4,Table Mate II,"Table is OK but the shipping was too slow. I paid immediately but had to 2 weeks for it to arrive. Also, the box was damaged."
4,Great Product,I am a home health care provider. I bought this table for a lady that has a lift recliner and she loves it. It fits up to the chair perfectly and she can look at the paper on it or eat on it. Its very handy.
5,This is awesom,I live in a tiny boarding school and i have a tiny desk but with theis table i have so much more space
2,Knock-off,"I purchased one of theses at Bed Bath & Beyond. It was 29.99 and overall better quality. It was ALL white and had a slide out cup holder. I thought I was buying the same thing at Amazon .... it arrived in a plain box and the metal parts are all *gray* and no cup holder. Also the metal piece that holds the tray is thinner. The little label on the packaging just says ""Table Mate II"" - does not indicate a copy cat. I don't know - maybe the company is just going cheap. It does not have ""Table Mate II"" embossed on the table front as the BB&Beyond; one does.I gave it two stars because it is a dissapointment. I think it may do the job, though. We will see if it holds up to the first one over time....I paid 21.99 for the Amazon model. I love shopping at Amazon - but, I guess sometimes you just ""get what you pay for""."
2,It looks cheap,"It's very durable ( I have it for about 2 years ), but it looks very cheap. I wouldn't buy it if I knew before."
4,It does the job,"I did not want to pay much for a tv tray since is not used all that much. I usually would eat dinner at my main table but occasionally like to eat upstairs in the bedroom to be able to watch a game while eating....this tray filled the bill for this....a very simple tv tray that folds away when not in use and is not very expensive..... is nothing special but again, I did not want to pay too much...I probably would have paid about $5 more for the same thing at a brick and mortar store...."
4,I like it!,"I just received this as a gift and I really like it. It's pretty sturdy and has six heights you can set it to, (I'm not sure what you would use the lowest one for, but ok) and you can set it flat or for two slant positions. I use it for holding school books while I'm working on my laptop. I can slant it up so I can see the books, or keep it flat if I want to put stuff on it when it's next to my desk. It folds flat, so I can slide it under my bed or chaise lounge. Oh, it has a little slide out cup holder, it's a little on the small side, only a smaller cup of coffee would fit, but most glasses will.The only thing I would like more is if the tabletop would rotate sideways (Like hospital tables do) so I could pull it up to my bed/chaise and use my laptop on it when I'm laying down. Besides that, I like it!"
1,Table Mate is II is a piece of junk!,Very flimsy and the metal parts were rusty (looked like it was used!) so it was hard to adjust. Had to return it. Great concept if the materials used were of higher quality.
2,table-Mate II,This table is not like my other table-mate II. This is lighter and doesn't seem as well made..It's functional but not like the first table-mate that I purchased..
1,Big disappointment!,"I should have read the reviews before I bought! The table was warped right out of the box and you can't make the tabletop level. Where the notches are won't make it level, it's either too high or too low. It is flimsy, wobbles a lot and not sturdy at all. We purchased at the same time another table called Table Max. This is much better! It has five level adjustments instead of the three Tablemate has. It is much sturdier, too. Buy Table Max instead!"
1,Piece of junk - not the real thing,"I had a Table-Mate table already and bought this one for my husband. I was wary when I first saw the outside of the box 'Similar to as seen on TV'. This is not the same Table-Mate table. It is a very poor knock off. The table is extremely flimsy, and no way is it level. I returned the table and bought a new one for QVC."
3,"Overall good, but design could be better","This is a handy product for those who eat in front of the TV. Regular folding tables are such a pain because you either have to sit on the edge of the sofa or far away from the table. Table-Mate II is great because you can scoot it right up under you AND sit comfortably. So for that, it's useful. It's also pretty easy to assemble.However, storage is another story. Yes, the top folds down, but that's it. It doesn't lay flat so you can't hide it away nicely. Also when the top is folded down, it throws the whole thing off balance and tips over (on carpet, anyway). I've heard that they now make a table that folds flat, but I was too cheap to buy that one ;-)"
5,perfect for my camera,i bought this for my Sony F717 and it fits perfectly inside. this bag is great.
3,"Why do critics keep calling this ""passionate""?","I was so excited to find this book in a used bookstore because I work with a similar demographic of students and wanted to hear about this teacher's experience. The students' writing in this story is powerful and important, but the author doesn't give us enough about their lives or his own. I was expecting this book to be for teaching and writing the equivalent of what FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS was for football--a VERY close, VERY personal account of how one activity changed people's lives. Not so. Don't expect to find out how any of the students ultimately turned out. The author admits at the beginning that he has no idea.It's worth reading, but don't go into it thinking it's going to change your life."
3,Snow sport works well except on ice,"Moved to WV mountains and it has been a bad winter. I was impressed with the snow sport until we had an icy deposit on the pavement before the snow came raining down. The plow will just simply float on top of the ice, as it scoops the snow. Even securing the blade to the plow receiver, with restraining straps, provided no help."
2,Tries too hard,"This book tries hard to be poignant, but doesn't make it. Much too depressing, and not entertaining enough."
4,Some really good stuff,"I'm more of a fan of this album. Something you don't see in Amazon's info is anything about the backup, which is top-notch, including the Jordanaires on a handful of numbers. Clearly Macdonald loves the material, and if it's not brilliant, it is heartfelt. He does best on the uptempo stuff, like Tiger By the Tail. If Amazon let me, I'd probably give it a 3.75."
3,SNORE,"I have always been a fan of McDonald but I don't think this is the best example of his work. His Woody Guthrie album aside, I think his finest work was with the Fish. It's worth a listen for collectors, however.."
5,"AMAZING, JUST AMAZING","As a thirteen year old muslim, I always asked my self, will there ever be an answer to the relation of islam and evolution. T.O. Shanavas has just completely clear and I was able to understand. He comes right to the point and I hope that this book makes a fortune"
5,Groundbreaking work of brilliance!,"At last, an indepth scientific treatment of one of life's most essential questions: Is religious revelation in accord with scientic wisdom?It is well past time to realize that Science and Religion are twin sisters.You needn't stay locked within mind numbing superstition or negate the magnificence of the divine plan. But, you must READ if you wish to know.If you don't read, you have no one else to blame but yourself for your continued state of ignorance. Open your eyes and open your mind. Neither truth nor science should be frightening or threatening to the person of true faith. The mind is a divine gift!"
3,405 pieces!,"I wish I had paid more attention to the sheer number of pieces included in this building set. I thought it was more of a play alone item, but my son definitely isn't interested in playing with it unless someone is pretty much putting it together for him and it takes quite a while. Once it's all together he LOVES it, but that just doesn't happen that often."
2,A bit disappointed,"This toy looked so cool online. We thought since it was made by Mega Blocks that the pieces would be bigger and more durable. To our surprize this was pretty much just like an intricate Lego set. The suggestion was for 6 and up. Our son is 4 1/2 and we thought it would be fun and challenging for him. Instead it took an hour or so for an adult to set up and then the thing is so shakey, it kept falling apart. Sadly we packed it up and will store it for a few years and try again. Big disappointment."
2,Too many random false alarms,"I had high hopes for this device, as one of the cheapest motion alert systems out there which supports multiple zones. I bought several of these devices to help monitor various properties (4 receivers and 7 detectors).For the most part, the product is pretty easy to configure and detects motion well. The critical problem for me was that out of the 7 detectors, 3 of them were defective in terms of giving off random false alarms, several times per day. (The other 4 worked perfectly.) At first I thought it must be due to the detectors being overly sensitive to shadows or insects or something, but then I put all of the detectors in a closed shoebox for several days as a test, and these 3 still gave off occasional false alarms, so they were defective.I'd recommend going with one of the slightly more expensive alternatives such as the RWA-300R Reporter, or if cost is no object, the Optex Annunciator."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this Skylink HA-318 with a second Motion Sensor. Set-up was difficult, and the unit was not responsive for the most part. Waste of money. Does not work properly."
1,dont work,i got this product and was very disapointed in it its not very good to alert you if someone is outside then it stopped working all together and the box for the house isnt very loud at all i was unhappy with this item
5,Extreemly Usefull!,I have an unheated enclosed breezeway between my house and garage. I know the previous owners of my house had a break in. They had an ADT alarm system installed after the break in. I know that my breezeway would provide a burglar with excellent cover when trying to break into my home. This made me very paranoid. I purchased the Skylink HA-318 Motion Alert to let me know if anyone enters my breezeway. I love this product. I think I have only received one false alert in the past three months. An extremely rare false alarm is no bid deal to me.
3,Too Many False Positives,"The false positives are coming every few minutes now during the day. It's interesting that the unit didn't start doing this until the summer temps reached 90+ degrees. Once the sun goes down, it performs normally again. Besides this defect, it seems to work fine. The only thing I can figure is that the heat has impacted the circuitry even though I placed the unit in a shady area."
1,Spend your money on something else,This product worked 3 times before the IR sensor died. I had ordered a second sensor from another vendor and it too died after 1 time. Over all the money you would spend to get this I would use to put towards a good solid system.
2,Must have gotten a defective one,"I've read the instructions, and it still hasnt worked. Not saying this product is garbage, i just got a defective one...its too bad i threw away the package or else I could have returned it. Live and learn"
3,"Good Product , Received Opened Unit","I have no complaints about the bushings themselves... I am upset however, that the units they sent me had already been opened...One of the bushings had the assembly grease on it with the opened grease package still inside... The truck was apart and up on jack stands or I would have sent the back..."
1,worthless,"A waste of money. Put it in a sunny area outside a barn with thousands of flies. After 3 days= 1 fly.Got out my old ""Big Stinky"" and got hundreds in one day."
3,"The Best was ""just average""","I enjoyed watching the video but I can't believe that this was ""the best"" of that long running show.Rather than just raw footage of old shows it would have been nice to have some context on the evolution of the program and the development of some of the puppet characters. At least the price was very modest."
5,Masters in This Hall,Beautiful classic music for Christmas ... brings back memories of Junior High and High School Choir concerts!
5,heats very well,Have had other heaters of this type . this one is by far the best for heat almost no smell on start or shut down
1,Not worth buying,I bought this product to cleanse my system and after 2 1/2 weeks NOTHING different than before I started taking it. I even got up to three pills twice a day and nothing!! Not pleased at all!!!
1,Side effects,"After taking the recommended dose of 2 pills twice a day for two weeks I experienced significant electolyte imbalance, with dizziness, lightheadedness, weakness, low heart rate and chest discomfort that lasted for more than 2 days.I am pasting some notes on the side effects of the main ingredient, Cascara Sagrada:""Short term use may cause cramps and long term use can cause disturbance of electrolyte balance, esp. potassium deficiency, which, with abuse, can lead to disorders of heart and muscle function (CE). - Herbal Medicine: Expanded Commission E Monographs.-- Blumenthal, Mark; Goldberg, Alicia; Brinckmann, Josef, Eds,; Tyler, VarroE, PhD, ScD.""""Do not use this product for weight loss or for extended periods. Long-term use ...may cause severe problems such as blood mineral problems (e.g., low potassium, low calcium), poor absorption of food/nutrients, weight loss, muscle weakness, bone damage (osteomalacia), permanent damage to the large intestine."""
3,Caution!!,"If you suffer from chronic constipation problems, then this product will probably be good for you. HOWEVER!...if you are already 'healthy' (""2-3 formed bowel movements per day"", from the label) in that department...you do NOT need this product! I misunderstood and thought that after a period of 'cleansing', my body would get back to that 'healthy' paradigm. Well, when I contacted the company (and they were very helpful) I learned that basically, I never needed their product...this info before purchase would be very helpful."
1,its not what i have expected,i read all the reviews but none mentioned that this product is not intended for breast feeding moms not until i read the label of the bottle. It is not also safe for those women who are also in the peak of conceiving for it contains ingredients known to cause fetal defects. Im not really sure if i will send the item back or just give it away. im very disappointed in this product but also glad that i didnt take them for i myself is a nursing mom.
4,Good so far..,I started taking these pills 3 days ago....Apr 13th and so far its doing ok. On the first day I took the one pill that was recommended once in morning and once in evening...nothing happened. Second day took two pills twice a day...had alittle bit of stool movement that day. Day 3 took 3 pills this morning and 1 movement. I know some people say that it could take a couple of weeks to have a regular 3 a day movement so we'll see. I have lost 1 pound within these three days.
5,"Gentle, effective cleanse","the ingredients in this product combine to provide natural, gentle, effective elimination, usually within 24 hours. no uncomfortable side effects (for me). worth a try!"
1,super cleanse,"Shipping was as high as product, and it was too high.I assumed that shipping was free , never showed untill it was too late. Product was not as strong as that i buy elswhere .I dont know why, well never again. This review is more on the seller who ripped me off on shipping. who never put shipping in plain site for a weak poor quality product."
5,Gentle enough for every day,Follow the directions and you will clean yourself well and feel better. After a week I back off to 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening daily. I am confident there is no build up of waste in my intestines. No side effects.
1,does not work!,"I have given this product enough time to take effect and was really excited to get started, but nothing different happened. Oh well back to raisin brand and prunes."
1,Not working for me at all,"After reading the wonderful reviews, I decided to give it a try because I want to lose my last 10 Lbs. I've taken 3 tablets each in the morning and night for 3 weeks, nothing happened to me. I still go on my regular BM schedule about once a day. No weight loss at all. Greatly disappointed!"
4,works well,"It does as it says, no big ""gunk"" cleaned out, but it will keep you very regular. Ease up on how many you take daily, as it can cause cramping."
3,It's ok,I would recommend this product if you have trouble with your bowel movements. It works well with that but if you have a fast metabolism then it's a waste of money.
1,DO NOT USE!! HERBAL LAXATIVE CAUSES COLON DAMAGE!,"I bought this product a couple months ago because I was having some constipation issues. After reading the reviews I thought that this product would help me to clean my system and start fresh. I only used the product about 2 weeks consistently. It was working well for me at first but didn't continue to work. I discontinued the use of the product. I did try a couple more times but in total I maybe only used half the bottle. Upon further discussion with my doctor about my issues, I ended up having to have a colonoscopy. The results showed, among other items, that there was damage called melanosis coli. This is caused by herbal laxative abuse. I have never taken any other herbal laxative other than this product. So needless to say, the small exposure I had to this product damaged my colon. I didn't even use it for the time period stated in the dosing instructions. BEWARE of using these types of products!"
4,GOOD,i never used a cleanse before so i wasnt sure what to expect. ive been using it for the past 30 days and also work out and ive lost about 15 lbs! it definately gave me more energy for the gym and got rid of alot of toxins in my body! definately recommend for people who are looking to shed 15lbs or so in a month. just make sure u work out and eat healthy too!
1,Didn't Work!,"I bought this product and hoped for great results. But unfortunately, nothing changed. It has been 10 days now and I'm up to the max dosage of 3 pills in the morning & 3 pills in the evening. I've had nothing more than I normally did before taking this product. Oh well - into the trash they go..."
1,The only thing that was cleansed was my wallet!,This product did not live up to its hype. I never lost a pound in one months time!
1,scam,"Super Colon Cleanse, Dietary Supplement, Good Source of Fiber, 240 capsulesAfter receiving the product and not tolerating it well, I sent it back to the company for a refund and the request to stop future deliveries. In two weeks two more bottles arrived. I sent them back unopened and again requested no more product. With each delivery my credit card was charged $579 later, several letters and emails, the deliveries stopped, but NO REFUND. It has been three months and no response from the company. I would give this product a zero if it was allowed"
3,average,"I didn't mind what it did to me but the overall goal was not acheived. I *am* glad that I tried it though. I don't know, maybe a different brand name might have worked better for me specifically?"
5,Great!,"Received the product in just a few days! Very timely response. It arrived in the condition described, I would definitely do business with this vendor again."
1,Did not work on me.,Point blank. It did not work. I tried this product for over 1 week. It did not. The pills are extremely large to swallow.
4,I'm happy today,"I've been taking this for a week now along with Natrol Acai capsules. Let me tell ya, I weigh 10 lbs less today than I did a week ago! I started with 1 pill the first couple days, than one in the morning and one in the evening after that. The Acai I took one in the morning and one in the evening. All I know is I weighed myself on the same scale and today a week later I am 10.5 lbs less. It may just be all the crap in my system being flushed out. I have been going #2 like 3 times a day, it hasn't been horrible out of control or anything. I have had no unusual side effects like dizzy or feeling sick or anything. I don't feel I have a rush of crazy energy but I feel good anyways. So we'll see if I keep losing."
4,Does what it says,This works pretty good just didn't like the aftertaste of it going down but it works better than anything I have tried.
3,Smaller than I realized,"I love the fragrance, but the diameter of the container and puff are much smaller than I would have liked. Looking for a larger puff and container. Would not purchase this product again."
4,They work well.,"These tablets work well to preserve our lawn against the urine burns of our two boxers. No more pee spots on the lawn. I was worried about the dogs getting UTIs or other urinary problems, but they have been taking this product for well over a month now and no such issue has come up. The only thing I dislike is the crushing of the pills that we need to do so the dogs will eat them with their food."
5,dog pee,"Since we started early with this product and our dog is small, we really don't have a basis for comparision. But our lawn has only 2 spots of burning, and that might even be due to the dog.So I would say this product does work very well. We give it to her in the morning wet food, and it must taste okay because she has never not eaten it, even directly."
1,Very poor results.,"I was getting a few yellow spots once in awhile with ""Grass Saver"" so thought I'd give Green-ums a try. All I got for the money was LOTS of yellow spots on my lawn.I went back to ""Grass Saver"" purchased at Petsmart.It works much better for my 11 pound Havanese.This was money completely wasted for me."
1,Stomach problems.,Two days into the program our little one developed stomach problems and the runs. Once we discontinued she immediately cleared up.
1,I'd rather hear NMH Kidz Bop than this slop.,"What an unnecessary embarrassment. These covers neither take the songs in a new direction nor pay even a glance of homage to the originals. They are cheap, flat and carry all the cop-out rawness and bleating pretense of a bad open-mic night. I'm not sure why this record was even made, unless it's coattail-clinging, because it sure doesn't sound like a tribute or reinvention. Take away Jeff Mangum's words and it's empty. Neutral Milk Hotel is sacred territory for many critics and listeners alike (I love their music so deeply, I feel almost protective of it, so please qualify my subjectivity). I'm sure Viking Moses loves them too, but that doesn't justify the carelessness of this record. I'd push up my granny glasses and call it irritating, irresponsible even. There's a reason that, despite considerable attention, these songs weren't covered for eleven years. I wish Viking Moses got that."
5,Walker users absolutely love this product!!,"I bought one for a dear friend who lives in an assisted living facility. Other residents ended up requesting me to buy it from Amazon for them since their relatives cannot find it or they were more expensive in local stores. Now, there are about 10 of them in the facility who have this organizer walker bag. They all love it!! It keeps their things organized and is durable (made of thick denim) and washable (I suggest handwash and airdry). Easily attaches to walker but is also easy to remove. You can even fold walker without having to remove the bag. Buy it for whoever uses a walker. They will love it!!!"
3,walker pouch,"I LIKE THE STURDINESS OF THE DENIM MATERIAL.I LIKE HAVING THE EXTRA POCKETS ON THE INSIDE,MAKING THEM EASILY ACCESSABLE.THE POUCH IS A LITTLE ON THE SHORT SIDE,I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT ABOUT 5 TO 6 INCHES LONGERACROSS THE TOP AND DEPTH ABOUT ANOTHER 3 INCHESWITH MORE SECURE ACORING, SO IT COULD HAVE THESTRENGTH TO CARRY A LAPTOP COMPUTER."
4,Handy item,This denim pouch is a very handy item that I purchased for my husband's walker. He can put several small items in it that would otherwise have been difficult or impossible for him to carry in his hands while walking.
5,Tasty meal at the office,"I eat this meal about twice weekly and find it is extraordinary. Until Ensavor came along, I had not tasted an instant meal so tasty with just the right spice and zest that was actually created with good ingredients. Why is that so difficult? This stew tastes just great over a bed of short brown rice and has just enough liquid and protein to complement the vegetables that are cooked just right!"
3,American Roots,"Evolving from out and out racism with the slave trade, this pictures Amish people trying to make amends with the now civilized slaves. By this time the North U.S. states had freed the slaves but they didn't have many rights. The N wod is still used, but not in as hateful a fashion of the first 4 Roots films. The times WERE and still ARE- RACISM!!! No film series ever so adequetely depicted the times in America as Roots, a trasure of American TV and historic film making."
2,Fingernails across a blackboard,She's a excellent harpist and the tunes are fine. Problem is her harp sounds considerably out of tune on several of the tracks. It's almost painful to listen to them. I find I don't listen to the CD because I'm alway wincing when she hits the bad strings!
4,"Harry, Sandke and big band jazz","Recorded in Hamburg, Germany, late in 1996, this CD features Harry Allen and trumpeter Randy Sandke with the RIAS Big Band. Tempos are either up or slow, with the quicker tunes taking precedence. ""Shaw Nuff"" and ""Turnstile,"" a Gerry Mulligan tune, are highlights. Tune selection is most interesting and somewhat atypical of outings such as this: songs range from Ellington's ""Echoes of Harlem"" from 1936 to Freddie Hubbard's ""Bird Like"" from 1981. Well done!"
2,Misleading Product Name,"My feet get hot at night and it has gotten to the point that even sticking them outside of the covers does not help. It doesn't matter if the rest of my body is hot or not (which, actually, the rest of my body is usually a normal temperature). My feet just feel like they are on fire. This lotion is called ""For Her COOLING Peppermint Foot Lotion."" It does not cool - AT ALL. It reaks of peppermint (which I hate, but was going to suffer through if it helped my feet), but it does not cool. Very disappointed."
3,Not as Useful as You Might Think,"While this FX Guide is true to the Alternity rules and can fit into virtually any setting, I can't help but dislike many of the choices for the new skills. Too many of the Arcane Magics have an evil feel to them (summoning evil spirits, blood magic, fire magic, etc), and too many of the Faith Magics are difficult or dangerous to use (alienism, shamanism, etc). This makes many of the new skills inappropriate for heroes in most settings. The Super Powers are, sadly (in my opinion), the best made and most playable.Despite those complaints, it is a well written book and anyone who is interested in putting magic into their setting will want it. I will only warn Game Masters about the power of FX Skills--they will put Psionics to shame. Be very careful to balance them if they are used."
3,"Great novel, poor spelling","The Time Machine is probably my all-time favorite science fiction novel, so I jumped at the chance to purchase the ""critical text"" when it became available. Unfortunately as I read the text I found spelling errors in it! For fifty bucks and a critical edition, you'd think the editor and publisher would take more care.The introduction, annotations, and appendices were worth the price, but simple spelling errors cannot be excused.For the novel: five stars. For the editing job, 1."
5,excellent annotated series of hg well sf works using 1st editions,This is an excellent critical edition of the initial edition of the Time Machine by Leon Stover.Most reprints of the Time Machine and other of Wells' SF novels typically use later revisions. Stover argues effectively for the greater artistic merit of the initial editions. It is part of a series of extensively annotated editions of Wells' science fiction. The editor also has a lengthy introduction which discusses the context and ideas permeating each novel. Stover makes good use of previous studies while also providing his own illuminating analyses. What I like is that Stover keeps close to what Wells wrote and said in his various books and recorded conversations ratherthan spinning some personal take on the novel. Please do not confuse this with a typical reprint of the Time Machine or any of his other sf novels. It is much more. Serious readers of HG Wells should get the series.
3,A glimpse of what is to come,"The Time Machine is a story of a man who prophesized the future. H.G Wells did a great job of setting up the plot of the story and also added a few action scenes. When the main character had went far enough into the future, he discovered a society of mindless people. They did no thinking, just sat around. He found a library of books which hadn't been touched in perhaps a thousand years. Perhaps H.G Wells has given us an insight to our future, or maybe the book is just science fuction. You can read this novel and make that decision for yourself."
3,Better than Most Kid's CD's,"I do like this CD, but find that it seems to move slower than I like a kid's CD to move. Love the first few tracks, but then it drags a bit. It is easier on the ears for parents. I like that they have used old, lost children's songs to make this CD. Really fresh selection of songs.I just wish they would have picked up the pace a bit."
4,Dan Zanes ... Great Childrens Music!,"Started watching him on Sesame Street and then The Disney Channel, and my daughter was really into him. So we listened to his music, and went to one of his concerts (awesome!). The music is true, clean, and no ""Barney-Wiggle"" annoyances. Introduces the kids to various instruments Guitars, Drums, Accordions, etc.The songs contain a very catchy beat for adults as well, and Father Goose takes nursery rhymes to a whole new level.Dan Zanes offers a musical taste for all genres.And thank you Dan Zanes and Friends and Amazon for going DRM Free!!!Better Quality, Play Anywhere... DRM Free!"
5,Everyone's favorite--great!!,"I can't say enough about this CD. It is truly mom's favorite, and my 2 and 4 year old kids can't get enough of it!! I sometimes find myself playing it when I'm alone in the car. It is such a nice change from Raffi, etc. (raffi has his place, but we need a change sometimes!). You won't be disappointed."
5,kids galour,"dan zanes is back with this great cd. i have seen him perform in person and i think he is great. you should buy this cd and check it out. if you have kids, buy it!!!"
3,goes flat,The fun and innovative arrangements and the high energy would warrant more stars for this CD but why does everyone sing flat? Children especially should hear music well-sung.
2,"Bad melodies, bad beat","I bought this based on [Amazon.com's] notes of ""customers who bought this (John Lithgow, Singin"" in the Bathtub) also bought..."" Great name and catchy graphics on the cover, too. But the CD was really disappointing. The singing and harmonies were not melodious and the beat was weak. Nothing catchy at all. Almost the opposite of what my kid would like."
4,kicky and fun,"My young son loves this CD, though it did take a few plays for him to get used to the funky beat. The rapping Father Goose cut is a hoot. Definitely not a pre-nap CD; use this one to burn off any extra energy!"
4,Well....,"This CD is goofier than the reviews had led me to believe. Not bad for a children's CD, but not sap-free. Wouldn't want to listen to it cross-country, but around town is fine."
5,CD,This is a fairly unknown band from the 70's. Rock and roll with a different sound than the usual bands from that era. Would highly recommend listening to it.
5,Lake is Cool,"Lake is a great band who found their niche in the late 70's early 80's. They kind of sound like early Toto, but better. Start with this and you'll want more of their stuff."
5,a classic sound,lake is an awsome band a friend turned me on to them and i love this band the sound is a cross of yes & starcastle from cool balads like do i love you to pounding it out in on the run if you like true musicians you'll need this cd.....
4,This is the blast from the past I have been looking for,"I had this album in high school and wore it out. I have been looking for it on CD ever since. I could still sing most of the words to Time Bomb. What a surprise, my ex-husband, knowing my love of the group, found this CD for me for my birthday! It has brought back so many great memories so thank you!"
3,Excellent music - poor sound,Would it be only for the music I'd given this underrated band 10 points. But the sonics are really crab. Why hasn't a little remastering been done at least? These lovely tracks would so much benefit from this treatment. Everything sounds flat and harsh. Always the same old story. The record companies spend so much money on keeping young people buying their products which turns out to be not as succesful as intended. But they tend to neglect music lovers who really buy music instead of downloading it.
4,Shimano shifters,"Good price. This was my first time changing shifters. They were easy to install and adjust. They work well, but I don't know how well they'll last long-term."
2,"loks great, but.....","It looks great and looks as if it will do wonders, but I have yet to figure out how it works! I'm wondering if it was put together wrong! The instructions don't say much at all-completely no help! I've been searching online for somewhere to take it;perhaps they can help me!"
2,very disappointing,"This was a Christmas gift. It arrived on time BUT the telescope was defective. The lenses did not fit, the focus knob became stuck and never worked. I returned it wtithout any problems and purchased another brand telescope that is wonderful."
5,"Smiling, Laughing, dancing","Whenever I listen to this album I find myself smiling, laughing, and dancing. Deanna simply is an artist that creates a mood of ecstasy with her voice and skills with piano and sax. Every song is charged with energy. So clear some space and prepare to boogie chillen'."
2,Frustrating,Wonderful classic songs sung by an historic group but recorded in very low fi. The sound quality reminds me of recordings made in the twenties or music played through the speakers on my netbook.
2,Classic songs...done better by others,"Yes, I know the Weavers are a legendary folk group. Yes, I know that their catalog of songs reads like a top 40 list of all-time folk greats.However, not having been very familiar with the Weavers' sound (I was only familiar with the legend that built up around them), I bought this album thinking it would be a terrific collection. If you have never heard the Weavers before, my caveats are:1. Pete Seeger never could sing very well. His voice is hard to listen to many times. He is a great songwriter, but lousy singer.2. The production is (I guess, predictably, given the time period) not very polished. A lot of these sound like they were recorded in a barn or something.3. Songs like Guantanamera and the other well-known tunes were done a whole lot better by other performers. The Weavers might have been the first to record some of these, but they were not the best, in my opinion.Still, the record exudes a simple (albeit homely) charm, in spots."
1,Terrible book,I did not like this book. The characters were fickle. The Duke showed no signs of affection towards the heroine. In fact he was rude and cold. I did not like him at all. The heroine claimed she loved one yet was okay being with the Duke. There are other books by her which are better.
1,Not worth it,"As a starting woodworker a number of years ago I bought this thinking it would be more accurate than a regular tape measure, it wasn't. Suggest - Use a hand clamp and attach/align the 1 or 2 inch mark to where you want to measure from (exactly on the mark), then just subtract that from your final measurement. It keeps the tape measure from moving, gives you a very accurate measure, and you don't need this electronic version. New woodworking toys are fun, but you can pass on this one."
5,How social service agencies destroy community supports.,"As someone who works in a nonprofit social service agency, I was handed McKnight's book by the executive director of a local foundation. It made for illuminating reading. McKnight explains how agencies isolate and target populations for their own convenience - determining the needs of their ""client"" rather than helping individuals express their own dreams and desires and working toward solutions. This is a ""must read"" for agencies whose goal is to build caring communities, allowing people with disabilities to determine their futures for themselves. Of particular interest is the section on grief counseling, describing how the professional grief vampire isolates their ""clients"" from the circles of support provided by friends and neighbors that have nurtured the grieving for generations."
3,Outdated with some good insights,"This book was a little out dated, but many of the inisghts in the service industry were still relevant and thought provoking. McKnight's writing style lacks authority and comes off sounding paranoid, or possibly opportunising of people's distrust. In place of quality arguments, quotation marks were placed around terms to discount thier worth and catchy phrases were repeated every chapter. All in all, it has value to those working in the service industry as a counterpoint for self-reflection."
5,Social Problems,"The book arrived in just a few days from purchase date and in great shape. I was pleased with how fast it arrived and very thankful because I was late in ordering the book, or so I thought. Thank You!"
4,just fine,"I would have liked to receive it a little earlier, but all and all it is fine and the book is in good order. Thank youClaudia"
3,Nice Cartoonish Introduction,"Granted, this is a book aimed at the ""popular science market"" but it's a bit more ""popular"" than ""scientific.""Stephen Jay Gould, David Quammen and Ed Regis (among others) manage to cover complex subjects without resorting to ""gee whiz"" simplifications and tacky drawings. To be fair, Rudy's subject matter is more obtuse and theoretical than natural history, and his approach is likely driven by that. It just felt a little condescending."
4,pretty mind bending until he gets on his agenda,"This book pulls together a lot of study and conjecture about higher dimensions (from everywhere from Abbot's Flatland to Einstein's relativity theory) into one volume, and explains it using easy to understand analogies and imprecise cartoons. It's really cool for a while, even though you might suspect subconsciously that it's not completely realistic to expect to fully understand all this stuff. What helps him clarify so much of these theories about extra directions and the illusions of time is his dogmatism about how within reach all of this is, and this is what hurts the later sections of the book. When he begins to try to stretch this largely impractical science to explain things that really don't seem to make sense, and does it with such a converted manner that you begin to think that he is crazy and maybe you have been being fooled a little..."
2,An introduction to 4D space.,"This is a nice well-written book about what a 4D Universe would be like, and delves a bit into Einsteinian spacetime. The problem with this book is that Rucker wrote another book ""Geometry, Relativity, and the 4TH dimension"" which has tons more information in it and is at least 1/10th the size of this book. So, in a way, this is just a wordy repeat of his older book."
3,Fourth Dimension,"After I read ""The Power"" by James Mills [which I ordered from Amazon], I wanted to try to understand higher concepts that were a backdrop of the story; concepts such as quantum physics, the fourth dimension, plasma, holograms.I didn't get very far into ""The Fourth Dimension."" It was just like math textbooks explanations of how to solve problems. When somebody explains it to me: one step or more has been omitted because it was assumed that it was known or understood.Then I went back and read ""The Fourth Dimension"" an Amazon customer review"" It advised Rucker's ""Geometry, Relativity and the Fourth Dimension,"" was easier to understand."
5,"Rare Treasure, A MASTERPIECE!!!","For Sure by Marvin Miller is a TREASURE! I was given this CD as a gift. What a gift of music it is. I love good music and thought I heard it all, but I have been taken away. The entire CD is layered with depth, passion, and real experiences in love & dating that I can relate to. I have to be honest I have not heard such wonderful lyrics and good time feeling dance tunes from a male artist who is in touch with his own feelings that he can applaud women. I listen to my GIFT all day long because it brings out every range of emotion, gives me hope in love and takes me through my own memory lane! My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE songs are: First Kiss,For Sure,Forever, Goin Out Tonight, Glad to Meet you, and Ain't Nothing But A Party. MEZMORIZING,BRILLIANT,AWESOME!!!!!"
4,I never thought,"My lady bought me this as a ""just because"" gift. I thought it was another guy singing about how much loot or how many women he had. But honestly I can say this brotha, REALLY has something to say, from a REAL man's point of view. I really enjoyed it and I know those of you reading this will too. Thanks Marvin, for keeping it real and minimizing the jive."
2,Black Berry Storm,This is the phone has had the most glitches and drop calls than another cellphone that I have ever had. The verizon family plan has turn out the be one of the most expensive and complicated phone plans that I have signed-up for. I do not recommend this phone or verizon to anyone.
2,grip review,"The product itself is fine, but ""red"" is not red. Their idea of red is actually more of a burgundy color, so beware."
4,The title says it all!,"I first heard a reference to the book in a sermon, so I went looking for it. David Dunn writes delightfully of the various ways he has brought joy to the lives of others by simply thinking of and acting upon ways to serve others. If we would follow the principles set forth in this little volume, the world would be a much happier place."
5,Try giving yourself away,"I loved this book, it was so inspiring and it gives you ideas of so many little effort on your part that will mean so much to someone else without costing you any money at all. For instance, just a smile or a friendly hello to a stranger may leave a lasting impression. I would recommend this book to everyone who would like to make a difference."
3,Good Insight into the True life of a Samurai,"While a true fan of the Samurai movies may enjoy reading about the life and times of the last Samurai, those looking for a ""real life"" account of the Characters found in the ""last Samurai movie"" will be sorely disappointed. The first chapter starts out alright, but gets pretty dry with a great number of names, places, dates, and facts, all of which also read pretty foreign to the average reader. Its not too unlike trying to read the old testament, book of numbers or book of kings. However, a fan of politics will certainly appreciate it. The life of Saigo Takamori was one of a civil servent - imagine reading about the life and times of your postal carrier. However, it improves if you get throught the first 2 chapters."
5,Fascinating. lively and accessible book,"Mark Ravina has written a fascinating book about Saigo Takamori, providing insight about one of the most intriguing characters in Japanese history and the world in which he lived. Reading ""The Last Samurai,"" I felt like I was seeing Saigo for the first time as a real person, and not just as a historical or mythological figure. Ravina does an excellent job of explaining what was happening in Japanese politics and culture -- and why it was happening -- during Saigo's life. As one of Dr. Ravina's former students at Emory University, I am proud to see one of my favorite professors publish a book that's so scholarly and well researched, yet accessible and lively. ""The Last Samurai"" is required reading for anyone with an interest in Japanese history, and for anyone who's curious about one of the world's most fascinating leaders."
3,Servant,Samurai is to serve and this book is a history of the place of the Samurai in the world of Japan. It was a historical treatsie and would have been more enjoyable had it presented a more full characterization of the events and stories of specific actions taken by the Samurai in their function of service to the Emporer.
3,"Good but very ""textbook""","This book gives a good general overview of Saigo's life.However, a word of warning. I found the book to be very ""textbook"" in its style, and did not feel as though I really knew Saigo when finished. It tells of his life, but does not really give you a feel for the man himself. Perhap's the inclusion of a few of Saigo's personal letters would have helped. (which are often referenced, but rarely quoted)Furthermore, I was a little confused as to exactly why all the Samurai at the time looked up to Saigo so much in his early career. The book could have included a little more connection with samurai culture and other influencing factors.I am by no means bashing the book, and I recommend it to anyone who would like to know what the film ""The Last Samurai"" SHOULD have been about."
1,"Dry reading, not much to do with the movie","I was interested in reading this book to gain some background information about the characters depicted in Tom Cruise's ""The Last Samurai."" This book contains a great deal of historical information, but the reading is dry as dust. The basic chronology of events are told with little expanded detail to lend interest. Unless you are deeply interested in the details of Japan's historical political intrigues, or a compulsive book-finisher like me, this will be a slow read. A bewildering array of names, dates, and events make it hard to keep track of who, what, and why. The opening of the first chapter is the most engaging - read it again after you've finished the book. I think Saigo's story has the elements of being quite an epic - evidently he is quite revered in Japan. Perhaps another book will help to flesh out the story and tell it in a more engaging way."
4,Interesting and different,"So often faerie plots wind up contrived adn silly; this one doesn't. It actually is very believeable. Eden is a midling sort of heroine; she changes and grows throughout the book and eventually becomes worthy of the title. But that comes at the end, so it hampers the story a bit. Hern/Hartley/Cornelius is superbly written, very strong, yet a touch vulnerable even as a Fane lord. The forklore is very well done as are several of the minor characters. Perhaps the wrong done is forgiven too easily, too quickly (except of course between the hero & heroine), but it's not much of a detriment. There are a couple of loose ends I'd like to have seen wrapped up. At the climax, I was crying so hard that I couldn't read the page. Not perfect, but an exceptional book well worth the read."
3,So-so.,"I can't believe all the 5-star ratings this book got! It was okay, but definitely not the best from Ms. Krinard. My main complaint is that none of the characters were particularly likeable. Somebody out there back me up."
2,Not Great,I found that this book was somewhat flat. It was ok but it was hard to hop straight into the story.
5,This music lifts your spirit!,I really enjoy listening to this on the way home from a long day in the office.
3,Good tale but facile understanding of business environment,"An interesting tale of an importnat American icon. But, this book has little understanding of the local competitors that McDonalds and other foreign multinationals face in East Asia, many of whom are quite formidable. I recommend ""New Asian Emperors"" by George Haley et al. to understand the complex business environment in East Asia."
5,Dedicated To A Lifetime Of Wonderful Students,"""Stuck"" is the culmination of the long and glorious teaching career of Richards, better known to his students as 'Mr. O'. It is a return to the carefree days of Brit Lit and all the lectures on Shakespeare, Milton, and metaphysics delivered from his imitable lectern. Most especially, however, it is a return to the wonderful rambling dissertations and stories that were tangentially spawned by those lectures. Make no mistake, ""Stuck"" is an excellent book in its own right- a curiously original inspection of humanity with a curiously original science-fiction wrapping. Spiced with fascinating characters and remarkable plot devices, Richards' first effort as an author demands several more to come."
5,I love it!!!!,"This is such a wonderful novel, I highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys something a little out of the ordinary. Orndorff did such a wonderful job with it, I cannot wait for Home and On Earth to be published!! Mr. Orndorff is a wonderful teacher, and his writing is no different. I guarantee you'll all enjoy it, it's a great satire on human nature!"
1,Great group; HORRIBLE compilation,"This compilation features both live and studio cuts. The eleven studio tracks are excellent songs with okay sound quality (this was an early generation cd). Unfortunately, the last eight tracks are embarrassing live tracks that are awful in every way, both in terms of the performance and sound quality. Try the ""Electric Music..."" or ""Fixin' to Die"" cds for starters, or the other compilation (""Collected""), but avoid this at all costs. Now that Vanguard has begun remastering their catalogue, hopefully they will see fit to discontinue this cd and give Country Joe and the Fish a compilation disc they can be proud of."
3,not what I was looking for,"Amazon very kindly gave me the 800 number so that I could call the manufacturer about this product. It is NOT 100% cotton, there are synthetic fibers as part of the package, which makes it unsuitable for my fabric wrapped totes."
5,Awesome and Inspiring,"I had a copy of this CD of organ hymns from the Crystal Cathedral before. This is my second one. I think I gave the first away to someone. It is probably the best 'church' organ music I have ever listened to and there have been many.If you love the old and some new hymns, you need to order this CD. You will be inspired as you hear the organ played the way it was intended - with gusto, spirit and a clear expression of man to the God Whom he loves and serves.Doc"
3,It's Good,Good price but not very tough material. Only lasted a week before it got shreded. If you have a wild dog like me you might want to find a stronger mat.
1,are these dimensions correct 4 x 18 x 11 inches,"Based on reading many reviews - I assume the deminsions listed for this product are incorrect. Amazon you must change, according to many people it is a flat matt not 4 inches thick as lsited in the dimensions 4 x 18 x 11 inches."
4,Sleeper for Jade,"This was a great gift for my friends cat, she loved it.and it got there in Hawaii on time or in time for X-mas."
2,Thin & fun to eat,"It is really thin, so a folded towel works just as well. My dog took a bite out of it the first night and decided it must be a toy when she found that there was stuffing inside. So, for me it was a waste of money."
1,"Very, very thin cover type mat","Definitely not a bed, but more like a cover for a real bed - it's about as thick as a cheap bath mat.The mat is less than 1"" thick even though the description says 5"" thick.Very disappointed. Do not buy if you are looking for a comfortable, cosy bed for your pet."
2,Very Thin Pad - Not 5 inches thick,"The specifications indicate that the pad is 5 inches thick. They are about one inch thick. Still OK, but not as thick as you would expect."
2,Great at first but lasted only 3 days,"When I first got this crate pad I was very impressed. It seemed comfortable enough and looked great in my puppy's crate. It also seemed pretty sturdy and I was sure it would last for some time. However, the pad only lasted 3 days. I left the house for a few hours and came home to find my coonhound puppy's crate filled with pieces of the bed. Her last crate pad (super cheap from Walmart) lasted 2 months so I was surprised to find that this one did not."
4,Nice Mat,"Nice mat, soft to the touch, my dog likes it. I have it in her dog house. If I would suggest any improvements, it would be to make it thicker."
4,I'm happy and the pooches are too!,"We de cluttered our living room from 3 crates to 1 and our dogs immediately didn't know what to do with themselves so they took to making our new couch their bed. NOT HAPPY! So I found these great beds. Although they are a little thin (thus the 4/5 stars), I took a chance and purchased them because the price was right and I was tired of spending $40 on beds that got the fluff ripped out of them. My dogs immediately took to them. They are nice looking, haven't gotten chewed up and are SUPER EASY to vacuum with my Dyson! (I have rugs that get sucked up in the vacuum and these don't and the hair comes right off! It made me SOOOO happy!) I'm excited that I can also toss them right in the washer when they need cleaning! I think I'll be ordering more for other rooms in the house!"
1,Not recommended,"Produces more fluff when scratched than any bed we've ever had. And, per that scratching, it soon fell apart. Was almost relieved as I was tired of cleaning up after it. Not thick. Not durable. And a pain in terms of keeping cleaning. Definitely not recommended."
2,"Ok, too much money and too thin.",this picture is very deceiving. The angle the picture was taken at makes the bed look thick when it is not.this bed is only .5 inches thick. for the money you can get a much thicker bed that you pet would be much happier with.
2,Not as advertised! Its a mat and thats about it; not a bed!,This product looks like a bath mat. It is soft and great for some but this is not what I thought I bought. I am disappointed.
2,misleading,"the picture looks like its 2 or 3 inches thick, its only about 1/8 inch thick. i would not buy it again."
3,Just ok,It was just ok for the Money I thought it would be thicker. It'a plenty large and the dog seems to like. But I had hoped it would be softer.
2,Not That Great.,"I bought this item off the recommendation of someone who said that the product didn't slide and was tough. Well, my dog just nibbled at the corner and the stitching fell apart. When I put it in his crate, it slipped and slided everywhere. I was disappointed with the product. The only thing I liked about it was the color and the feel of it. Other than that, it wasnn't that thick or that well made."
3,Not as fluffy as I thought from pic but still love it!,Looking at the pic of this product I thought it was more plush or fluffy. Its really thin in real life but it actually worked out for what I am using it for. My new puppy actually chewed his crate tray to shreds the day before this came an I felt horrible that he'd have to lay on the bars on the hardwood floor. So this came in at the right time and shipping was fast!!
1,"Not a bed, it's a mat.","This is nothing more than a rectangle of black plush fabric. There are no raised edges on it to give the pet a feel of it being a ""bed"". I really wish they had an image of this before I bought it, but hopefully this review will prevent any of you from making the same mistake.This would serve OK as a mat inside a pet carrier or dog house and will suit UP TO a medium size dog. It IS only $5, but whether or not that is worth it is up to you. I reckon a scrap from a fabric store would be just about as sufficient."
3,Mat not Bed,This is not a dog bed. I REPEAT - NOT A BED!!! It's very small and has no cushion at all. What it is good for is a crate liner...if you don't want your dog to be lying on the cold crate bottom this is a good alternative. Don't buy this if you are looking for a real bed that they can snuggle up in.
3,Ripley ate this one too.,"These are not high quality beds, but more a crate liner, which is what I purchased it for. My dog chews up everything, and these are no different. On the plus side, they were pretty cheap, but once she finishes destroying these I will look for something else."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I bought this item based on another reviewers remarks, but it didn't work out like I expected. My dog tore the side of it the fist time he got on it. The stiching is not very tight on this. I will have to resew along the edges. I do like the nonslip side and the fury front, but that's about all I like about it."
4,My dog loved it...,"My dog loved this mat, but unfortunately she also ate it. I know this is no fault of the product. I would totally buy this mat again if I could figure out how to get my dog to stop eating her beds."
2,Bad description,The product says its a plush pet bed. It's really a soft rug that had very little purpose. Very disappointed.
3,Precision SnooZZy Sleeper Dog Bed,"I was pleased that is did actually fit the crate that I use for my dog, however it tends to ""shed"". I have black fuzzies all around her crate."
3,Dog Bed cushion,The bed fit perfectly in the crate. I was a little disappointed at the thickness of the bed. It was rather thin. Not a comfy thick bed that I expected. The dog easily pulls it out of the crate and I have to continuously put it back in and it is rather flimsy not sturdy.
1,Wrong delivery. Useless item.,"We have a 120 pound german shepherd. We ordered the ""jumbo"", they sent a medium. My dogs foot barely fits on it : ( Have yet to hear back from them."
2,Kind of useless,"Our cats aren't into this at all. The only use I've found is to add a little lining to the bottom of their transport and to put it on top of their heating pads on those cold, cold days when I actually turn the heating pad on.The cats prefer comforters, blankets, carpets, cat houses, cat beds, our laps, etc. to this. There is no benefit to having it.Also, we have two cats. It's the right size for the smaller cat. the bigger cat is a bit too big for it."
3,Could be better.,"You know, this could have anti-slip backing and ties for the corner so it doesn't slip around everywhere when the dog tries to lay in his bed.. It's very soft, but could be so much more better then a rectangle of fuzzy soft fabric."
3,cat likes,the cat likes this little resting spot. It is easy to clean and reasonably priced. It is a nice addition to the cat's house
2,too thin,Over priced for what you receive. Very thin. My dog does use it because he like anything to lay on but we have hardwood floors and he is a big dog so I was looking for a thicker pad. This isn't it!
2,"Mat looks fluffy, right? It really isn't.","The photo of this mat looks like it would be pretty padded but it isn't at all. It's quite thin. The back has vinyl dots so it's supposed to grip the crate pan, but in my car it ends up sliding around with the dog on it and being bunched up. Here are my comments to two claims they make in the product description:- Luxurious plush sleeper bed for both dogs and cats - not luxurious feeling - maybe luxurious looking but it's just fake fur- Non Skid backing for secure placement - definitely not secureIt was inexpensive, so you get what you pay for. I would not buy this again."
1,dog mats,Had the mats for a month. One has already fallen apart and the other is on it's way. I am afraid to clean them. One is already in the garbage and the other will follow suite soon
2,be sure to read product description carefully!!,"I was pretty disappointed when this mat arrived. It is very thin. I went back and re-read the description and it does indicate that it is only about 1"" thick. I was just going by the picture, it looks much thicker in the photo. Next time I'll be sure to read all the comments/reviews and the description carefully."
3,A lot less steel then the 4 star I,"Im not really a kitchen knife expert or anything, but I do own a set of 4 star I. Everything I have ever read says 4 star is by far Henckels best line...its their flagship (better then the pro s, better then the 5 star). Anyway my 4star I santoku fell onto my tile and the tip broke off a few months ago. I decided to replace it with the 4star II model. I just got it. It feels pretty good and is way sharper out of the box then the 4 star I. The extra steel on the handle is obviously taken from the spine of the blade. Looking at the 4star I and 4 star II side by side from the top down, the 4 star I has a much broader spine making the knife feel more sturdy."
3,Bram Stoker's Shodowbuilder,So-so movie. Nothing special...just a run of the mill movie. The acting was sluggish...not very scary. I watched it all...thinking it would get better as I went along...but it didn't. Not recommended...save your money for a better horrow. This one doesn't produce the results.
3,informative,this book has helped my bike a lot. i race duathlons and the bike was my weakness. this book has helped to improve my time and approach to the bike portion of the race.
5,Still Relevant after all these years,It is amazing how relevant this book still is. Ned gives riding tips and racing strategies that can be used by bikers of all skill levels. The only changes since the book was written have been in the technology used by 21st century athletes. I have a friend who has been riding mountain bikes for many years and he says he is still learning from this same book. It is only a shame that in all this time no one else has stepped up to publish a more recent version.
3,Good but not great,"Ned offers a lot of great tips and invaluable advice on how to best tackle your local mountain on bike without getting too much into the science and nitty gritty of it.It is small enough to read in on session, which is perfect for those who easily get bored with reading for hours.The only criticism I have is that it could have included some pictures/photos to make it more engaging."
3,Tidbits of useful information,"I bought this book as kind of a manual of how to handle a mountain bike. As such it is not a good book. What you do get is a number of short chapters convering everything from beginners to to racing professional races. Read a chapter and you will pick up some ideas of how to handle your bike. I wish the book was more structured. I've given it three stars because I have not found anything better, but this is really a two star book if that better book is published.I also boughtMountain Bike Magazine's Complete Guide To Mountain Biking Skills: Expert Tips On Conquering Curves, Corners, Dips, Descents, Hills, Water Hazards, And Other All-Terrain Challengesand I'm giving that book exactly the same review. The coverage is the same.If you know a better book PLEASE leave a comment."
1,useless,"Well for me, useless. I didn't feel a little bit better after taking them. Also, I am a little confused and concerned that the comments are true or just from fake buyers."
3,An OK CD from an OK band,"Like most people, my first exposure to Josh Dodes Band was through VH1's Bands on the Run. And while many of my fellow reviewers seem disappointed with the outcome of the show, I for one am pleased.But let's put that all aside -- this is about music, not reality television. I like the catchy riffs and poppy vocals that JDB has to offer. However, I have found that if you listen long enough, one song blends into the next until it all seems like one big, mushy song. They could use a little variety in my humble opinion.I give them three stars -- an average rating for an average band."
5,Support an up-and-coming talent and buy this album!,"I've dug Josh Dode's blend of funky, jazzy, piano driven rock ever since I sold him a computer years ago (it's VERY cool to see a fellow Temp slowly realize his potential!). While I truly enjoy his band's music, fans of Billy Joel will TRULY adore this album (which is not to say J.D. rips anyone off). If you don't end up buying this album PLEASE check them out if they play around you - their shows are cheap and all the members put their hearts into their work."
4,An excellent book on the origins of the Civil War.,"An easy to read historical book dealing with the origins of the Civil War. Dr. Levine is succinct and thought-provoking in his analysis. Imploying political, economical, and social factors, Levine explores attitudes and conditions in both the North and South. Professor Levine's concentraion on social aspects and their effects on the ""average"" American is refreshing. I had the pleasure of studying and being instructed in this subject with Professor Levine while a student at the University of Cincinnati, while he still taught at that institution. This is an excellent book for this subject. I would also reccommend in this area: ""Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Man,"" by Eric Foner; and ""James Henry Hammond and the Old South, A Design for Mastery,"" by Drew Gilpin Faust."
4,PALAISE 20 PIECE COMFORTER SET,IT LOOKED JUST LIKE THE PITURE AND THE FEEL AND TEXTURE WAS VERY GOOD AND RICH LOOKING.I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT
3,A worthwhile introduction,"A mixture -- beautiful, sad, weird. But definitely worthwhile. I was disappointed not to be successful in finding books available by these authors."
1,Doesn't last,"This percolator worked pretty well for 3 months, then just stopped working completely, so I wouldn't buy it again.The other thing I didn't like was that I had to use filters with it or the coffee was full of grounds. I've had several different percolators & never needed filters before.I was lucky, I was able to return it to the store where I bought it for a full refund, so if you buy this, save your receipt!"
2,Started Out With A Bang Then Fizzled,"One year after purchasing the Cuisinart 12-cup electric stainless steel percolator, it no longer keeps the coffee hot. I'm very disappointed because it makes a full pot of fresh, delicious coffee quicker than the drip coffee makers. I've moved on to a stove top percolator."
2,Makes good coffee but poor design,I bought the coffee maker a little over a year ago. Makes great coffee but the bottom plastic base became seperated from the stainless steel pot and bottom heating element. I am returning it to Cuisinart to see if they will back 3 year warrantee. The bottom broke for no apparent reason where the plastic base attaches. Will give update.
1,This is made by Cuisinart? Pretty but a dud!,Only lasted a year and that is with light use... only make coffee at home on Sundays. Just stopped working one day. What's up Cuisinart? I own so many of your products but this is so disappointing.
2,Hotness of coffee,"Brews a good cup of coffee but doesn't keep it hot. After the first cup, have to warm it in microwave."
1,You've got to be kidding,"I bought two of these 18 months ago. One didn't perk right from the very beginning, frequently bypassing the perk chamber, creating weak, watered down coffee. Not to worry, the other one, after working ok for just over a year, burned out its element so stopped perking altogether.I therefore took the stem from the burned out one, mated it to the other which hadn't perked correctly since purchase, and for a while I got good coffee.Then the second heating element burned out, and that's the end of my story. These are cheaply made products. Don't buy them expecting them to last.What did I do next, you ask? I bought a 40 year old perk from ebay at half the price. It makes great coffee."
4,Wonderful Coffee!,"Retired my new type of Cuisinart coffee maker in favor of the old-fashioned type perculator coffee maker. The Cuisinart perculator makes the best coffee ever! It is hot, flavorful, and doesn't take long at all to brew. Careful hand washing, unplugging after coffee is brewed and poured are my suggestions to maintaing this in good condition. So far, it has not let me down. Well worth price!"
4,Love it!,"Great purchase price, came with in days of ordering. Looks great and is very user friendly. Heats up coffee pretty good!! Love hot coffee, and this makes hot coffee. Love it."
1,bad product,"After 3 months of use, the perculator is dead. The electrical function of the pot stopped working. Of course, I no longer have the box and the receipt is filed away somewhere. As a result, I cannnot give this a positive review.PS- we did get a few light brown water days that the other reveiwers wrote about. I thought it was my wife making bad coffee, but I guess the problem is common."
2,Stopped working after 3 months,"I give this 2 stars because every single day for the past 3 months, we have adored our Cuisinart percolater. The coffee was always hot and delicious... Moments ago, we awoke on a beautiful Saturday morning, plugged in our precious pet, and it wouldn't turn on.....We took great pains cleaning this machine DAILY, removing the hardware after brewing to prevent the break down of materials...We gently scrubbed each part inside and out- DAILY! Just like the reviewers before me, no loose plugs, no bad connections, just not turning on when plugged in. We researched this product for a while before purchasing it and now we are coffeeless.. We are both sitting here in shock and sadness. No coffee..And I was gonna make french toast. Now, I'm just not in the mood.. I am just so shocked..My husband just annouced he is depressed now..Damn you Cuisinart...We are coffeeless..."
2,Thanks for all the REVIEWS,"I'm shopping for a good percolator coffee maker and thanks to all the reviews here I will not buy this product or have to deal with the terrible Cuisinart product support. What is this nonsense that they need a serial number!!! Now I will rethink buying any Cuisinart product.Why don't they apologize for making a faulty product, and be glad to make the customer satisified.I will look elseware for a good coffee maker. Recently I went to some high end stores like Macys to look at coffee makers. Lot's of high priced junk out there in all brands.It use to be so easy to get a good coffee pot or toaster, or any kitchen appliance, but it seems now they just throw a stupid digital timer on a product and think they are offering you the world.Hey, coffee pot manufactures . . . just make a product using the best heavy duty materials, and leave off the nonsense. Pick a price based on the product's QUALITY and it will sell."
1,Crap,"If you only want a year out of your coffee maker, buy this one. This is our third and all failed within a year an a half."
4,good percolator,"this is my 3rd one of these coffee pots. i love the way it brews, coffee is hot when done. orange light indicates complete brewing cycle. bought a new one because my last one kinda just stopped working-it wouldn't brew the coffee properly after about 1 1/2 years of constant, everyday use (i make a pot every day). i love cuisinart, and i have lots of their kitchen products that work well. however, i was using a melitta electric percolator before this one and i liked it just as well. it seems i couldn't find the same one when i had to replce the melitta, so i tried cuisinart. i would still recommend the cuisinart product if your a perc user."
1,This WAS a great coffee maker,After making great coffee for 5 months the Cuisinart Percolator's coffee started getting very weak. Needless to say my rating went from 5 stars to 1. I need to find a Percolator that will last!
2,electric percolators,"Today I am on amazon to buy an old fashioned stove top percolator. I have purchased 2 DeLongi, 1 hamilton beach and 1 other one, all electric. I do not believe one of them have lasted a full year. I have spend WAY over $200.00 to get my perfectly perked cup of coffee, they are all great for a while. Even when you clean them every other week as the instructions state (with white vinegar), still does not make them last. I do not believe they are for daily use. So...I am going to save a lot of money and buy the stove top type. We can put a man on the moon, but we can't make an electric percolator that functions properly. The downfall of stove top is I cannot put it on the electric timer to have the coffee done when I get up, but oh well, flavor is more important."
2,Lasted 14 months...,"Loved and highly recommended it for over a year but five days ago it stopped perking coffee too soon. Perking time is so much shorter it gets my attention. Coffee looks like weak tea. I pulled out the apparatus, poured the liquid into large tea glasses so it could all cool down, reassembled it (with the same grounds), and it produced drinkable coffee but I don't have time for that! Holding Temp is so low every cup poured has to go to the microwave for 15 secs. I'm not playing the repair-center-every-14-months game and my dripmaker is coming back into use today. I hate that because it takes up twice the room and this was so elegant and nostalgic it made me happy. I expected it to last 14 years, not 14 months."
2,Cuisnart percolater,There were coffee grounds in my coffee cup and in the bottom of the percolater. I send it back and bought a cuisinart coffee pot.
5,Not noisy,"We've had other electric percolators that made a lot of noise, not this one.Nice looking on the counter and makes good coffee."
3,It's pretty to look at- pretty high maintance-have to keep wiping the chrome. Coffe not really hot enough.,"We bought this because Mr. Coffee wasn't hot enough. Not much difference with this new coffee maker, though higher price. High maintance to keep pretty chrome wiped clean after each use."
2,I just saved some $$: Thanks!,"I was just on the verge of purchasing the Cuisanart electric percolator, and thankfully, I took a few minutes to read many of the posted reviews! I love a good cup of coffee, and miss the old fashioned percolators, but frankly, I am immediately turned off by improper advertising of a ""glass"" top, when it is plastic to start with. Secondly, it looks like these do not have a very long life. Good coffee makers are not inexpensive, and accordingly, I expect them to last more than a few months, particularly when I only making one pot in the morning every day. I think it is terrible that manufacturers have outsourced so much and sacraficed quality and apparently, pride in product at the end of the day. Moving on!"
5,Brews Perfect Coffee,"I love this coffee maker! Percolator coffee simply tastes better to me, and I like that I can take this carafe straight to the table to serve my guests. I don't have a lot of counter space, so I don't want a coffee maker sitting out on my counter all the time. When this IS out, it's a nice complement to my stainless steel appliances. I had purchased an almost identical percolator by another manufacturer that was less expensive, but it burned the coffee, so I returned it. Thank you Cuisinart!"
2,Way more wrong with it than good,"Bought this based on reviews here, but this baby's going back! For one, the only way I could get coffee strong, the way I like it, was to brew 6 cups and fill the basket with grounds. That doesn't work. Second, it sucks that you can't see how much is left without disassembling the whole thing, that there's no ""auto-on"" function (I really need to know that coffee's ready before I can get out of bed) or that there's no ""auto-off"" function. Emptying out the grounds basket was a messy pain. I did love the look, the nostalgic perking and the no-drop spout, but just didn't find this the best fit for how we drink and live. Just got the 14 cup Cuisinart drip instead, which is great (but the damn thing doesn't fit under teh counter. Guess you can't have everything)."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"My husband and I prefer a peroclator mainly because it keeps the coffee hot! We have always used a Faberware, but these seem to not have a very long life. With the reviews of this product, we thought we might have found just what we needed. Wrong! The coffee is not hot and doesn't get any hotter sitting in the pot. We returned it and bought the Faberware again. Very disappointed."
2,Cuisinart PRC 12 Percolator,"When you see as many 1 star reviews as this product has had -- pay attention. I'm on my second Cuisinart PRC 12 percolator within a 2 year period. The the base of the first one fell off. Cusinart was good about replacing it. Of course, they required receiving the ""original receipt"" -- so I sent it in along with the coffee pot. Shortly afterwards got another one. Coffee was great but within a year the bottom of the base started cracking off piece by piece. Now I'm without an original receipt so needless to say this will be my last Cuisinart anything. Hope the Presto I'm ordering will hold up at least 3 years. If not, I'll let you know."
3,Back To Mr. Coffee Drip,"What can I say. Have this product for less then a week and have not had a true cup of coffee. Sad to say Mr Coffee, which last about 6 months before I have to buy a new one makes much better coffee with less grounds. On the upside it is a beautiful pot to look at, shines great. Makes a great conversation peice. Maybe it was nostalgia from the 50's at Grandma's that made me think percolator coffee was great. I have a burr grinder and have tried several different grinds. If anyone has the secret to making a great cup of coffee from this pot, pray tell. I really would like to use it. I give it 4 stars for its beauty and 2 for the coffee. Ya, if you can divide it is 3."
2,Buy a microwave along with this item,"We bought this because our old perfect Farberware died. Cuisinart used to be a good name brand, but no longer. The metal of this pot is thin and for some reason after brewing the element decides it has done its day's work. Ten minutes after brewing it is necessary to nuke the mug of coffee for 20 seconds to get a hot drink. We're donating it to Goodwill and trying another Farberware."
2,Leaks grounds,"Even with the use of little filters, this coffee pot leaks grounds and makes it necessary to strain the coffee through a juice strainer to be able to drink it. Don't buy it. Get the Farberware one even though that one will die within 3 years. Also, it does NOT keep the coffee hot in the pot...any cup after the first requires heating in the microwave."
4,Percolator Plus,"I love it because it takes up less room, and when not in use can be tucked away in a cabinet.The only problem I have is the fine ground coffee gets thru the basked and into the bottom of the pot. Sometimes you get grounds in your cup of coffee. I finally decided to buy beans a grind them myself to cut down on the small stuff getting thru & I use filters to help eliminate the problem."
1,Very upset cuisinart customer,"I have always had a percolator so having cuisinart products and another percolator by them I ordered this one. I received it the first of Sept. 2006 and on Nov. 10 plugged it in, it sparked at the pot and that was it GONE!! I am sick about this as I had thought Cuisinart was a step above the rest."
2,Cuisinart 12-cup Percolator Let Down,This percolator does NOT percolate the coffee. The unit is a huge let down and I'm off to buy a new one and it won't be Cuisinart.
2,inferior product,"I bought this to replace a Melitta Java Perk that finally gave up the ghost after 8-9 years. I was concerned over some of the reviews for this product but crossed my fingers hoping for the best. Very disapointed. The coffee pot is extremely loud , making a grinding & thumping sound...the first time I tried it I thought it was going to walk across the counter. The sound terrified my cats, not what you want to hear first thing in the moring. It also did not keep the coffee hot after perking. Even without adding cream one has to microwave it. Dont waste your money. You can still find good used vintage percs that were made to last. I've since picked up several and they are far superior to what is being made today, plus they were made in the U.S.A.The seller was very responsive and processed my return in record time, the 2 stars are for the seller, the product is inferior and undeserving"
2,Stopped working after 4 months.,"Pros:This percolator is very stylish, which probably attracted us to it initially. It perks quickly and makes great tasting coffee. We like to use the Melitta wrap filters specially made for percolatorsMelitta Coffee Filters for Percolators, White, 3.5-Inch Discs, 100-Count Packages (Pack of 24).Cons:Unfortunately, for about the first minute this percolator makes a very, very loud clunking/slamming/springing sound. Without exaggeration, the slamming can be heard throughout the house. Once the slamming stops perking continues normally. The only other negative is that the bulb is a plastic material; would have preferred it to be glass.UPDATE:Yesterday, it stopped working. We've only owned it for 4 months. Would not recommend buying this product."
3,Could be better,There is no base for the perc to sit on meaning you have to unplug and plug back in to serve coffee so its not very portable friendly. I also wish the the top lid knob was made of glass instead of plastic.
5,Christmas,"My mom loved it. Don't know what else to say. Blah, blah, blah, this is ridiculous blah blah, blah, blah"
1,"lower quality, less reliable","Plastic bubble cracked after one month, no replacement available from Cuisinart, only the entire lid assembly. Heating element started to fail after one year. All we get now is weak lukewarm coffee like they serve at church picnics or in prison. Poor customer service and weak warranty coverage. Save your money and buy something else. You can get this level of quality for a lot less money elsewhere."
1,returned unit,"Bought it for its looks, but unit did not make good coffee after two tries so we decided to return it"
5,Super,Good product. Good service. Got there in time for Christmas... Thanks. Drinking a cup of coffee right now.
3,OK Percolator,"I have had the Cuisinart percolator for about 2 months and it is doing ok. I find the product makes good coffee. Is relatively easy upkeep-wise and doesn't make a lot of noise doing it's job. It is a bit tall and I would have preferred a stouter, same capacity model, but we shall see what the long term performance is. Right now it rates 3 stars. I will add a star each year it is operational.jme"
5,Cuisinart PRC-12 Classic 12-Cup Stainless-Steel Percolator,"This solved all my wife's gripes. It's fast, classy and smells great.The smell is for me and the great taste is for her. I got some brownie points with this purchase. (Guys you know what I mean). It's perfect."
2,"Good coffee, but unit died after 5 months","We liked the unit and it made good coffee. However, after five months of daily use (about one pot/day), the heating unit died. I've sent a note yesterday to Cuisinart re warranty service. We've been through 4 coffeemakers in five months; most leave a terrible plastic taste in the coffee (the perc did not; its all stainless steel) - apparently we have more looking to do to find a fully acceptable unit."
4,Cuisinart PRC-12,"The Cuisinart PRC-12 makes great coffee very quickly, and it is wonderfully convenient to simply remove the cord and serve the coffee. The pouring spout works especially well. The only problem that we have had is that coffee grounds tend to escape the filter/holder and get into the coffee. While that may be an issue of having coffee that is too finely ground it is hard to find coffee ground specifically for percolators, so it would be helpful for Cuisinart to design a more effective filter unit."
1,VERY Disappointing!!!,This product worked for two weeks then quite percolating the coffee...only would stream hot water...sent it back after two weeks of use...very disappointed with product and performance...surprising due to Cuisinart's reputation...perhaps just a defective one....amazon was great in regards to refunding total cost.....
4,Excellent basic percolator w/ a great warranty.,This percolator is excellent. Piping hot; no bells and whistles; just an old fashion quality method of making gourmet coffee.
2,Buy the Graco brand version instead,"This car seat locking clip is supposed to function like the one that is typically included with your car seat when you buy it. We somehow lost our original clip that came with our Graco Snugride, so I picked this one up at a local store when we were preparing for the birth of our second child. The fit is not quite right so that it is VERY difficult to get the belt straps into it. Much harder than the (very similar looking) Graco belt locking clip. I threw out the ""Super Lock"" and ordered the Graco locking clip online. You can also buy it at Babies R Us stores for a couple dollars.FYI, if your car accommodates L.A.T.C.H. installation, you don't need a belt locking clip at all because you don't use the seat belts. All vehicles manufactured after 2001 have L.A.T.C.H."
5,Aunt Nancy and Old Man Trouble,"When life gives you lemons make lemonade. If you ever turned good in to bad you would probably relate to Aunt Nancy and Old Man Trouble. This is a funny tale that tells about Old Man Trouble's visit with Aunt Nancy and how she turns all his bad luck in to good. I enjoyed this book also because of the reactions Aunt Nancy makes when Old Man Trouble's bad luck happens, like When Old Man Trouble makes Aunt Nancy brake her chair she says ''now ant that a mercy, just when I was wondering ware I was going to get some kindling wood.'' If you would like you should find out the surprise ending to this great book."
3,gel grip hand grater.,i bought this for 4 dollars and thought it was a waste of money.. 30... wow. ok well its not for zesting like the other person said but can be for cheese. its not so bad. the gel grip is not very comfortable and big and bulky. i gave it a 3 because it does the job and hasn't broke yet. (6 months)
4,Music great as always-poorly put together though,"My problem with this live CD is not the music itself. The only people who even know this cd exists are huge Nick Lowe fans anyways. However, this CD would have worked so much better if it was just a recording of 1 performance. Instead, this a CD where it feels as if there was a break between every song which leads to a live CD where there is no audience interaction recorded. My other problem is that some of the recordings are not really well done. They sound more the sound quality that you hear at a local labor day fest.Regardless of this, it's still worth picking up. The versions played often are significantly different than the studio versions. While I prefer the studio versions, there are some great versions especially ""What's So Funny.."""
1,AutoBarn will probably send you the wrong one,"If you buy this from AutoBarn you're rolling the dice. They sent the regular Sport Grip instead of the Super Sport Grip. Not worth the hassle to return so I'm giving it away and trying again through Amazon.Update: Amazon apparently can't send the right one either. If you order this item, you will probably not receive it. ZERO STARS. PATHETIC."
1,worthless,"This is a very poor quality product. It snapped in two when I began to stretch it around my 15.5"" steering wheel. I am a very dissatisfied customer. Also not pleased that the shipping cost was greater than the cost of the product (I suppose that should have been a red flag!)"
3,Not for classic cars,"I was hoping this thing would stretch a little to cover my 17"" 1965 Chevy steering wheel but it won't. However, if you cut it cross-wise and split it down the middle, there is plenty of material to wrap the old way."
5,"Superior 58-0550B, best ever","Back in 1974, when I was of course much younger and more ignorant than today, I purchased one of these Superior 58-0550B from either Target or K-Mart.Installing it was EASY; I had a 1969 Buick Gran Sport, GS by Buick, with a black steering wheel and black interior. The instructions were straight forward and simple, clear, and effective.Over the many years since then, as cars have come and gone, a marriage, three kids, and life with all that is in it came my way, I often longed for the old GS and had promised myself that one day, I would have another.That dream became a reality in 2003 and then I began a quest to turn that 1969 GS into a clone of my original.To top it all off, I added the Superior 58-0550B steering wheel cover."
4,steering wheel grip,"Item has excellent feel and installed on rather easily , would suggest that plastic loom be made slightly longer, overall very satisfied with product."
4,Steering wheel cover,"This item is good, doesn't quite fit all the way around the steering wheel, there is a gap but it does work. You cannot buy these types of steering wheel covers in our local stores any longer, so I was glad to find one online. I just wish it fit a little better. It is plenty long enough, just not wide enough to cover the entire wheel."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This ""item"" is not very good at all. I ordered a stearing wheel cover. I received a strap of leather with strings. If I wanted to return the item, I would have to pay $5.00 shipping for return. Not worth it, just threw it away. Do not buy this product as you will be stressed and unsatisfied just like me."
4,Replacement for Nerf BBall,Bought this to replace the nerf basketballball for the self standing heavy duty nerf system. Name? Ball is great-more durable than original nerf ball and fits into the hoop just like original. Overall very decent ball for around $12. Just buy it and stop reading reviews.
3,very string good for its price,"It works, very good for its price.it all works and it is very solid, also accurate with tensions."
5,Easy stringing with this machine,I did my string using this machine. It turns out to be great.The actual product package contains more items than those shown in the picture. 6 strings are included so that you can start to use them immediately. The floating clamp(adjustable) could be tight if it is not adjusted properly. Putting some kind of tape on the clamp can be more safe. Watching the instruction video from Youtube helps a lot.
5,Great value,"I've had this machine for about 2-3 years now, and I don't really have anything bad to say about it. I've probably done about 30 string jobs, mostly for myself. With the 2-point mounting system, it's impossible to string some racquets due to their unusual frames, but most ""normal"" racquets should work fine. It's not as fast as a more substantial machine, but it gets the job done, and as far as I can tell, it does a good job. It's hard to know for sure without comparing it directly against another type of machine, with the same racquet, string, tension, etc. I'll keep using mine until I have a good reason not to, and I would highly recommend it to anyone stringing mostly for themselves."
3,Good budget stringing machine,The stringing machine worked fine. It just need a new manual with better instructions and diagrams. Specifically how to use the adapter to secure the racket head.
4,Excellent money saver,"I bought the Gamma X-2 as a gift for my son's birthday. He loves it. It took him 60 minutes to string his first tennis racket, including starting over twice due to miscalculation on the starting hole. He can now string a racket in 30 minutes. Interestingly, since he started stringing his own rackets he rarely breaks a string. Previously he was having the re-stringing done at a large national sporting goods store and breaking strings weekly. The X-2 comes with a starter selection of Gamma strings and grip tape. The strings alone will pay for the X-2 in saved re-stringing expense. Excellent value."
4,Good Value,"For the money, this is one of the better stringing machines for the home stringer on a low budget. I didn't bother with the composite floating clamps, as I purchased Stringway double and triple flying clamps. After roughly 10 string jobs, I've cut my stringing time from 2 hours to about 40 minutes. Ratcheting function on the dropweight arm is one of the reasons I would recommend the X-2 over a similar dropweight such as the Klippermate (but I would strongly suggest switching to better flying clamps). Came with 12 sets of free string from Gamma and all the basic tools you need to complete a string job. Great machine for anyone wanting to start out in stringing (and it essentially pays for itself after 10 string jobs if you normally pay $15 to have it done at a pro shop)."
4,"Good machine, does the job well","This machine is good for personal stringing. I've been using it to string my badminton rackets and it works well. But it does take a bit of time to string one racket, hence not recommended for professional stringers. Gamma also includes a bunch of strings to test out for free. Even their top of the line ones.The only negative thing I don't like about the machine is the manual. I don't think it's as comprehensive as it should be. Also, the clamps are not as nice to work with.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to those personal stringers out there."
4,It's the best value but bloody~~~,"As someone mentioned before, the edge of the handle of the floating clamp is extreme sharp. When I speed up to string my 2nd racket(especially in apply and remove the clamp), I got 1 deep paper cut and 1 serious cut (which I believe I lost a piece of my meat on one of my finger that bleed a lot and painful)on my left fingers. ""MAKE SURE to wrap the handle with some kind of tape (I use electronic tape) to prevent injury before using it""Other than the sharp edge of the clamp, everything worked out great. The clamp does it job great too, just wrap it with tape(to prevent injury) and don't waste money for a expensive clamp. It's a solid string machine, it should last for a very long time. There's a little drawer in the base to hold small tools, don't miss that. It also come with bunch of free strings, it'll be a even better value if you like those strings.(zo power 18, tnt2 16...etc)ONCE AGAIN, wrap the handle of the clamp before using it, this is not a joke."
5,Great starter machine for new stringer,"This machine is well built and very easy to use, it came with some basic tools. The drawer at the base is nice feature. You can do a pretty good string job on this machine, but if you are picky you will want a machine with fixed cramp, which cost $500+. Make sure you order a starter cramp too."
3,Strings like it is supposed to....but....,"I'm not so sure the string tension works properly. I cannot find in the instructions how the setting should be where you wrap the string around before pulling the tension bar over to tighten the strings. I string around 64lbs, but the finished product feels more like mid-50s. On my previous stringer, 64lbs would not really let the strings move; on this one, I can move them easily.12/25/2012 update: On my previous stringer, the Klippermate, you could increase the tension by a few pounds and pull two strings at once to reduce string time. On this machine, it is best to string cross strings one at a time at your desired tension. When you do this, the tension will be more accurate. Upgrade review to 4 stars."
3,Too hard to use,I bought this 2 years ago and never used it. It's just too hard to use. I tried youtubing and following instructions... Still complicated.
4,Good Value (But Replace Those Clamps!),"In spite of the fact that I had already read about some folks getting injured using the poorly designed clamps, I lost a good chunk of my finger flesh trying to get used to the clamps during the first stringing job. I still had a couple of old Klippermate clamps that I used some two decades ago, so I simply swapped the clamps and finished the job with absolutely no fear of losing any more flesh or cuts. My recommendation to anyone considering the purchase: get a better set of clamps!!The manual that came with the machine was a joke. It's the worst ""manual"" of any kind that I've read. I relied on YouTube for getting my first job done.Other than these two main points of dissatisfaction, I was pretty pleased with the overall product, particularly the quality of the rotating arms, the tray base, the drop weight with the racheting mechanism, and the generous inclusion of different kinds of string packages. It's a pretty handsome machine, too."
4,Movie Has a Complicated Twist,It was a great movie but you really have to watch it more than once because it's a little complicated to follow. I thought this was a horror film but it was not. It's more a mystery movie with drama.
2,THIS is the review I wish I'd read before buying,"I looked at the name (Groovaloos) and I looked at the cover -- and my gut told me not to get this DVD. I went against my gut and believed the reviews; I wish I'd listened to my gut. For those of you who think it looks and sounds a little hokey, you're right on the money. They can all dance, but compared to what I expected, they seemed mediocre. Here's the lowdown: (1) the sound sucks - they're in a city park and you can hear the instructions fine, but the music isn't loud enough to really ""feel"" something that makes you want to move, (2) they just seem like a group of people who don't naturally have a rhythm, but they've learned some moves; it's SO not inspiring, (3) it's not edgy enough, and (4) it looks good if you've got a group doing it, but when someone's doing it alone, it's just okay. Overall, this DVD was okay, but not great. Get it only if you're truly desperate."
1,Not described right,"I bought this through tivo. It was not described properly. I never would have bought it had I known it was some woman bantering on about ET's. She runs through a lot of ET evidence, but doesn't seem credible the way she jumps from subject to subject without full analysis. Her presentation was poorly put together."
3,Size wrong,"I have ordered this jacket twice now over amazon, 200+ dollars, and have gotten the wrong size both times :(I ordered a medium tall and got a medium regular but it's too cold to wait any longer, i gues i can make do"
4,A fun and frisky romp through the bedrooms of yesteryear.,"It seemed to me that history classes took all the life outout of the past leaving a shell of battle dates and wars.I never really cared about that. This book puts back whathistory teachers (and time) took out: The Smut!This book is an easy read as it has a lot of humor served indoses of one to two paragraphs. The subject is not wartimestrategies...well, not on the battlefield. Cleopatra'sseduction of Marc Anthony was better planned than mostmilitary skirmishes, and was far more successful with onlyone moonstruck casualty.I would recommend this book for anyone who loves history,and even for those that found it tedious in school. It isessentually a fun and frisky romp through the bedrooms ofyesteryear."
2,"Superior 58-0550T Super Sport Grip, Tan","I wanted a steering wheel grip that looked like the photo. I've had them on cars for over 20 years. The word tan seemed odd but I went with it. Instead of even tan, it was cream color. It looks like crap. It is so soft and absorbent that it will be dirty, nasty with hand sweat long before it wears. What a waste of money!"
3,HISTORICAL ACCURACY; LACKLUSTER EXCITMENT,"WHILE A WELL RESEARCHED AND ACCURATE HISTORICAL PIECE, IT LACKS VITALITY AND PERSONALITY. THE FACTS, HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, DESCRIPTIONS OF EVENTS ARE TERRIFIC. HOWEVER,THE WORK DOES NOT DELVE INTO THE CHARACTERS' MINDS, NOR IS IT A PARTICULARLY EXCITING WORK. I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING LIKE MICHENOR WHO TELLS A GREAT TALE WITH SUPERB RESEARCH, PERSONALITY, AND A PLOT. DANDO-COLLINS PROVIDES MANY FACTS,BUT WITHOUT CHARM OR MUCH CHARACTER."
5,Speedy delivery,I ordered this book for a friend. It was in the condition it stated on Amazon. It was just what she wanted. It arrived so quickly I couldn't believe it was the book I ordered. I would definitely order again from the seller.
1,"Unhelpful, distracting font on Kindle","I don't know why this book is different than every other Kindle book I have purchased. The font is very odd, with the ""d""s and some other letters exhibiting an open loop. It makes it annoying to read. Not sure why this doesn't have the standard Kindle font, or the ability to choose (the typeface options are all grayed out). . I would not knowingly purchase a book that had this font."
5,spaniards?,"the ""spaniards"" soldiers, of the X legion are always, like the Cortes, Pizarro and Frnacisco Franco soldiers, people from Spain, spanish soldiers, with litlle or none roman blood and of course the ""spanish"" roman cesars are indee of roman blood."
4,"Good book, but hard to read","The book is very informational and interesting giving you alot of detail about Caesar's 10th Legion and the Roman battles. However, it does bounce around alot and brings in alot of information that makes it too hard to follow sometimes."
4,Now it's the legion's turn to talk,"Dando-Collins' ""Caesar's Legion"" is a goldmine of information about the Roman military. A vivid episode shows just how important the eagle standard was to the Roman legionaries. Notes provide further reading and explain that the ""miles classicus"" is the equivalent of a modern marine, the ""primus pilus"" of a captain, etc. Dando-Collins explains almost every mile of Caesar's adventures in Britain and Gaul.However, the book is so densely packed with detail that within a line the legions may have traveled several hundred miles. Constant referring backwards or to the opening maps to visualize the troops' swiftly changing locations make it a difficult book to read carefully. For the military historian, occasional errors may be annoying.Pros: Well researchedEasy prose styleGood glossary, notes, and appendixCons: Factual ErrorsExhausting -- packed with detail upon detailStretches subject to fit book length"
1,Trash,"From quite literally its first page, this book is riddled with historical and linguistic errors which make plain the author's unfamiliarity with the Romans' social and political institutions as well as their military practice. It comes as no surprise, then, that when one reaches the end of the book, one discovers that his bibliography omits a number of essential contemporary works (e.g. Lawrence Keppie's ""The Making of the Roman Army"") as well as foundational past scholarship (e.g. T. Rice Holmes' studies on the Gallic and civil wars). A reader truly interested in the 10th, or any other, legion will come away from this book badly misinformed and wholly defrauded of the sum for which he or she purchased it. Quite simply, it is a book which ought not to have been published."
4,I bought it. I read it. I liked it,"I enjoyed the book very much. That is a subjective statement you may or not find helpful. However, I gave it a 4 stars and added my rating to the pile for those of you who consider the overall ranking by the readers."
3,Good start,This book is not nearly as bad as some have written and not in the five star range either. I enjoyed the book though I found myself wanting the writer to get on with it in some spots. I also had a somewhat distracting font with my Kindle also but was able to deal with it. If you are just getting interested in Rome I think this book will satisfy you and give you a desire to dig deeper into Caeser and other aspects of Rome. I am glad to have read it and would recommend it to the curious.
4,Roman History Lite,"I have to confess that I have some sympathy with the reviewers who really disliked this book. The book does innacurately promote itself as a unit history of the Tenth Legion. In reality ""Caesar's Legion"" is really more a general Roman military history. I also strongly agree that Stephen Dando-Collins' use of such modern terms as frigates and brigadier generals is really jarring. Nevertheless, I think there is a real need for popular military history. Not every reader is up to reading Kagan or Goldsworthy, let alone Xenophon or Tacitus. ""Caesar's Legion"" is a pleasant bite of ancient military history and hopefully it will inspire readers to push themselves onto more substantial works."
4,"Nice read, but where are the maps?!?",I can't find much to fault in this book except the lack of maps. How in the heck are you supposed to follow battle descriptions without a field map? How can one understand the sweep of the empire without political maps?
2,Not so hot,"Had I known the Warmrail was just that just warm, I would'nt have purchased it. It just get warm enough to feel on the towel. Once you remove the towel from the rack it gets cold fast. It will dry a damp towel fast but a wet towel takes about the same time hung over the curtin rod. Big waste of money in my opinion. Throw your towel in the cloths dryer for a minute of two and get better results."
2,remodeler,It doesn't really warm the towel even after sitting on the warmrail all night. However if you consider it's only 45 watt - realistically you can't expect a warm towel. It's equivalent to hanging something over a 45-watt light bulb but that's probably not a good idea. I think it would be good for drying clothes in damp or humid climates. I don't think I'd buy it again.
3,not the same,the cord on the towel warmer is thicker than the one I replaced. It does not have a on/off switch - have to unplug
3,It's ok,"It does heat up, but it takes a while. We never intended to leave it plugged in all day, just before and while using the hot tub. I thought that it would be great to have our towel heated as we exited the hot tub in the winter. Note: Our hot tub is NOT outdoors, but is in a corner of our garage that maintains a 40 degree temperature throughout the winter. This rack is not intened for exterior use.The rack isn't very large, so it only covers a small area of the towel(s). It gets hot, but not to the temperature that will heat the entire towel adequately.We have not used it inside the house yet. Hopefully, we'll have better results."
4,Love it!,"I love our Warmrails Wonderbar. It is very convenient as it hangs on our existing towel bar. Just plug it in. It is the second one we have. The only reason I rated it with 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wanted the chrome (which wasn't available) instead of white. Our towels are warm (but not hot)after our shower. Everything drys quickly on the Wonderbar. With our recent snow storm, it was great for drying clothing that got damp, it is also good for drying swim suits and beach towels."
4,Towel Warmer Lite,"This hanging warmer takes care of hand towels and dish towels in the kitchen. It is just fine for this application. It produces less heat than the free-standing model. If you want to use this warmer for larger towels like bath towels, I would hang it inside a closet or other enclosed space so the heat is concentrated on the towels."
3,Warmrails Wonderbar,I like the fact that the Wonderbars were the perfect size for an existing towel bar. There was no assembly so it was easy to use right away. I am disappointed with the temperature that the Wonderbar leaves the towel after being on the towel warmer all day and night. It does not seem to keep them at a high enough temperature.
2,not impressed,"maybe my expectations were too high, but this product doesn't get my towel that warm. its real warm where it directly touches the bars, but the rest of the towel is barely warm. pretty disappointing. currently looking for a better one because this one is going in the trash. spend a little more and get one that works better."
4,MARIO AND POP MUSIC,"MARIO LANZA was the best even at this type of meterial,for example so in love shows the dedicated raw emotions he put into every pop song which aslo shows he never put this type music below the musical food chain he made sure every song opera or not was tooken seariously another song you and the night and the music is just as good but the song that tops them all! is and this is my beloved its extremly romatic and erotic two words Lanza knew very well.Two songs that could have been left out though are ah sweet mystery of life and you do something to me. Beloved was fantastic also."
4,Interesting Bit of Americana,"Produced during the Second Red Scare and the McCarthy era, My Son John, embodies the patriotism and paranoia of the early fifties. Robert Walker's last role is intended as a moral lesson for ""good Americans"" but also panders to the fears of a nation fresh out of a world war with facism, entering a cold war with communism and engaged in a ""non-war"" police action in Korea."
4,Easy read,"I only brought this book because it was required for my class. It is easy to use and though I did not enjoy reading all the essays, they definitely provided excellent examples for me to write my own essays and give the instructor what she was looking for in order to get a good grade. I did not have to use any outside sources because everything I needed is in the book."
2,not as expected,"Internally the book was fine, externally there were many stickers, some said used, some were black pieces of tape. There was also residue left from tape/stickers peeled off. Not as expected."
2,The Return of the Angel,"Michael Lesy has been fascinated by archives for a long time. His Ph D dissertation led him to ""Wisconsin Death Trip,"" a remarkable testimony.""Angel's World"" is in fact the first chapter of a book formerly released by the same author (in 1985) under the title ""Visible Light"". In other words, compared to the original version, 3 chapters are now missing. Moreover there is no new light added to the chapter extracted from ""Visible Light."" The text in ""Angel's World"" is exactly the same, 26 years later, the images too. The latter were formerly displayed in the form of pseudo-contact sheets; in the new publication each occupies a whole page without any rmarkable improvement in the printing, whic for a photobook, sounds like a disregard of the photographer and the audience.I f you can look for ""Visible Light"" in your local independent used-book store, or search for it on Amazon."
2,Underwhelming,I found this book to be very underwhelming. The photography is good... but not fantastic (which is necessary for a photobook). The author's writing is very dry and the print quality lackluster. Vivian Maier is a much better artist!
5,"Haunting, touching","This was definitely not the book I expected. I bought this to give as a gift and fortunately, briefly paged through it before giving. I wanted a book of photos of grand New York from days gone bye. What I got was a haunting glimpse of the world from an isolated individual. It was not appropriate to give the intended recipient, now I have this piece of Angelo's legacy."
4,Simply Beautiful,"This earrings are just lovely and confortable to wear. They are smaller than I thought but I like it more now. They look more beautiful in real than on the screen.I recommend these earrings to anyone who is looking for a nice, delicate and high quality jewerly, to wear anytime and in any ocassion. The only thing that might bother you is the little pressure that you might feel when wearing them, due to the size and type of earring they don't have a rubber pad to soften the pressure on your ear."
3,disappointment,"I have always liked this brand of tape for my ATG gun over scotch because it is easier to work with and allows me to reposition a little before it sticks permanently. Unfortunately, this time around I had a lot of trouble with the adhesive sticking to the opposite side of the roll. I probably wasted 1/3 of my roll on fixing it repeatedly. I don't think I would purchase again at the current price..."
1,The Publish America Scam,"After being burned by this disgusting company - with a parade of complete dirtbags on staff to render completely useless services and support - I can honestly say this book is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to boast the success of the more popular publishing scam on the market today. Their substandard publishing techniques, their worthless support, and their complete disregard for the work and dreams of new authors is appalling. Please people, don't believe a word of positive motivation in this book. They are truly out to make money as an author mill, and not as a ""traditional publisher"", as they like to call themselves."
2,Starrett Digitape Tape Measure,"A good idea, but not enough digital resolution. Digital display accuracy is 1/16th of an inch. I know it could display to 1/32nd because it can display 1 millimeter when set on metric. Why not display at least to the smallest resolution possible?"
2,"Cool idea, but not very useful","I gave this as a gift to my father last year, and he never uses it because the digital part doesn't measure accuratly unless you pull the tape out slowly. The digital part is measured by a little black bar code in the middle of the tape - and if you pull it out too quickly, it mis-reads it. It can still function as a regular tape measure though."
2,Don't stick together well,"My son inherited a partial set of the old krinkle blocks from his much older cousin. He loved the old blocks so when I found this set, I was thrilled. My son was at no loss for creating planes, cars, beasts, etc... but whenever he tries to move them, they fall apart. He repeatedly gets frustrated when using these blocks. Clearly, they are inferior to the old version. If you've never known the old set, this one is great but we are greatly disappointed."
3,Bristle Blocks,"Perhaps if there were pictures with ideas of what to build it would encourage the child to create. I ordered my set about a year before our grandchild was ready for the toy. Then when I pulled the Bristle Blocks out, I realized there were no instructions or pictures. I telephoned the company from which I had ordered the blocks and they said there are no examples provided of what to build.If anybody knows where I could acquire ideas, I would be very appreciative."
3,Not as good as the original,"I bought these for my daughter when she was 3. Now 5, she and her 2 year old brother play with them. They are no where near as good as my bristle blocks from childhood (still at Grandma's). These just don't stay together well at all. The people that swivel and the wheels looked like they'd add great dimension and improve a classic toy, but with the reduction in block quality (ie, they don't stick together!), I have to say these are a so-so toy, at best."
1,"Morris all technique, no heart or passion","While technically astute and competent, this reviewer found this particular recording to be dry, passionless and void of style. Morris is a performing machine programmed for accuracy. Look for touching renditions elsewhere - frankly, it was difficult to get past the monodynamic renditions. Fortissimo is grand, but not on an ongoing basis. Highly disappointed in this recording."
2,Low Power,For hardcore Battlefield fans only. This early effort is bagpipeless and not especially creative. The electric piano cannot replace the guts that pipes give the later band.
3,Simple history of the Templars,"If you want to begin your studies of this fascinating order then this is probably an okay book to read.Simple exposition of the history of the Templars with all the recently described mysteries expunged.Small book, easily absorbed and understood."
1,Unfortunate waste of time,"I saw mixed reviews on this product and hoped I wouldbe one of the fortunate buyers for whom this product worked.Unfortunately, this product did not work at all, so I amreturning it.I spent several hours trying to line up the transmitter andreceiver, changed channels, tried transmitting from twodifferent locations on the first floor of my house to asecond floor bedroom, even tried using the coax cableinstead of the rca plugs on the recieving TV set.The total straight line distances from transmitter tothe receiver were from 20 to 30 feet and I needed to passthrough one wall and a ceiling.Nothing was successful. The results were un-viewable andlooked like broadcast TV with a broken antenna - distortedcolors, grainy and fading shapes, and no sound.I settled on hooking up an amplified rabbit ear antennafrom Radio Shack to the set and am now getting very goodfree broadcast TV on channels 7 -13."
2,30 ft is about it.,You're right 30 ft is about the maximum distance through any wall.I finally got the picture and sound working well by having the sender higher than the receiver. Now when i use it in another room there is no sound. I think the new video sender from china on ebay actually works better.
1,It's commentary version not a main textbook!!!,"Be aware that this is a commentary version. So tricky, because even if you type the whole title ""academic writing for graduate students"" for search, it shows commentary version instead of the main text."
1,Not a textbook,"Needed the textbook, searched by ISBN number(!!!!!!) - came this one, totally useless, abstract commentary thing. Total waist of money. Everything looked as what I need - the cover, the authors, publishers, even ISBN. Be very careful, read thoroughly the description. This book is not the book you need for your Academic Writing class."
1,The wrong book,"I thought it was the book ""Academic Writing for Graduate Students, 2d ed."" as everything looked the same including the cover, authors and the edition. So it was a waste of money for me."
4,a useful writing book,This book includes how to write an academic essay. It provides a lot of basic knowledge and give audience a outline. I think it is better introduce book to write paper.
2,What happened to the father?,"My wife and I ordered this book for our first pregnancy. The layout is great. The photos are great.But where is the father? Be forewarned, there is absolutely no mention of the father of the baby. No pages for the father to write his thoughts and memories of his wife's pregnancy.This may sound like I'm so wacko, family-value conservative. Believe me. I'm not. I had ordered this book so that my wife and I would have a journal for our first child. But, as I said, it's a journal for my wife, with absolutely zero mention of the father. Weird."
3,What about Dad?,"I think this book is beautiful, some pretty pictures and lots of space to write about the pregnancy. My only issue is the father isn't listed ANYWHERE in the book. There is a section for Mother's family tree but not fathers there is a section to tell about the mother and her growing up, but not the dads. I was hoping this was something my husband and I could fill out where he could put his reactions and excitement down also, but this book acts as if all fathers are non-existent. Other than that it is a beautiful book and I am using it - we are just writing in the white space for dad!"
5,Beautiful Photographs!,"Beautiful book, no teddy bears or other fluffy things. Only sophisticated photos with neat quotes and unique antique wallpaper backgrounds. Journal entries are easy with the prompts on the pages. Other nice thing is that the book is spiral bound, allowing for a flat opening while writing in the book. A real keepsake! One thing I wish it had was at least one envelope to put misc papers in - and finding the time to write in it."
4,good book,this is my third time buying this book. it is so detailed and wonderful to fill out. makes time go by. price is average.
4,waiting for baby review,"Nicely laid out, only thing missing is a section for daddy to write in his feelings and what is going on with him while this miracle of life is happening!"
3,"self-centered, not family centered","I really like this journal and have been able to adapt it pretty well to my needs. However, I am very disappointed at how self-centered instead of family-centered this book is. There is no space for my husband's thoughts/feelings, and there are only two pages in the whole book dedicated to family and friends. This over-focus on the mother may be what some are looking for (i.e. single mothers), but as a Christian, this pregnancy is centered on God and family and this journal simply does not provide much opportunity to express that. So, I am taking some of the pages I feel are unnecessary and covering them over with photos and my husband's thoughts, etc. The book is really nice; it's actually spiral bound but looks hard-bound."
3,Good but no info for dad?,"I previously got The Pregnancy Journal for my last two pregnancies and I loved that book but wanted something a little different this time around since I already had two of them. I chose this book based on the reviews and I do like the book although there is no spot for the dad's info. There is much more journalizing then the other book I have and it asks good questions that will be fun to look back on. The only negative I have is about the dad section-there is none, nowhere for him to write-it doesn't ever bring up the dad at all, kind of weird I thought??"
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book to have while you're pregnant. I use it with The Pregnancy Journal and enjoy them both, however, Waiting for Baby is much more of a journal for recording meaningful entries in. The Pregnancy journal is great for day by day information and recording weight, waist size, mood and all that weekly, but not for recording much of anything deeper than that. Waiting for Baby has room for everything and even prompts you to write about things you might not have thought of!The only thing I would change about it if I could would be to add a few more ulrasound pages. I think there are only 2 pages for ultrasounds and I have 4 already at 25 weeks. But there is a doctor's visit section where you can record anything you might have missed in ultrasounds.I'd definately buy this as a gift for anyone I knew was pregnant and I'd be sure that they would enjoy it as much as I have."
2,Where is Dad in this book??,I thought this book would be great when I ordered it but I was very disappointed. There was completely no space for Dad! The front has a family history/tree section but nothing at all for Dad. I guess this would be okay for single mom. I returned the book...very disappointed.
3,"Overall great, but I'd make a few changes","I'm certain there is no perfect pregnacy journal, but for my needs and what I've seen, this one is pretty good. My only complaint is that I wish it had more blank pages for journaling. There are 10-12 pages, but I like to write a lot and have to be more limiting with how much I write. I see that other people complain about the verbiage being only directed toward the mom and not the dad. I see NO problem with this because this is just for me. Between me and baby. I often write about my husband in the journal too, so he is included in the book by what I write. The pages are clean and fresh and the photos are great. Lots of room to write about each docotor visit! Overall it's a terrific journal."
3,Fabric is fairly rough,"Pillow is pretty soft, logo and everything looks fine, decent price.My only complaint is that the fabric is fairly rough."
4,Doggie Vitamins,"Our little girl ""Zena"" (American Pitbull Terrier) loves the flat tabs better than the new fat tabs!Wish that would make a difference?"
1,did not care for it,This music is not medeival in nature. I found it to contain offessive langauge and was not true medeival. This group needs to have a warning lable on their music. Any true lover of medeival music would agree with me. I can discribe their music in one word YUCK!
1,Keep It Out of Stock,"If this CD is out of stock, keep it that way CDNow! It is trash all the way! I think one of the reviewers has a problem. Lacking morals is only one of them. Kind of makes me wonder why CDNow would sell such trash. Sick, just plain sick stuff."
1,TRASH at it's best,"Do not purchase this CD. The first two reviewers are 100% accurate but what kills me is the reviewer from Finland tears it up and yet gives it a 5 star rating? Regardless, avoid it. Not medieval at all."
4,CD Changer!!!,"Hard to find, fun to use and these days - retro! It is amazing what happens to technology in only a few years."
1,Not really practical for a single user,"I am a manual wheelchair-bound person with the foldup-model of chair. Those chairs do not have the full-length armrest (invare 9000 xdt to be exact) so that means the smaller area for this product to strap on to when you use it so the front part of this board isn't supported by anything and kind of dangles. Further, strapping it on yourself with you seated in the chair is difficult. If a caregiver does it that's a little more helpful but it's more likened to the tray attachment of a baby high-chair (in fact, the quick release design and the mounts of a baby high-chair would benefit in a design improvement for this product).Unless you plan to do a long drawn-out project while in the chair, it is not practical if you're shuttling things from one area of the house to another . Largely, using a simple velcro band to mount it is a simplistic approach... it's not something really suited for quick on-the-fly attach or de-attachment."
5,Madaris Series ROCKS!!,I absolutely love all the Madaris Family and Friends sagas. This one is no different as I love 'Sir Drake' and his friends! It was awhile before I finally read this one; but it was worth my wait! I certainly give it 5 stars!
2,Mislead,"There were more than a few ripped pages. I know it was a used book but there should be notice of ripped pages. I was giving that book to someone as a birthday present and I was embarrassed to give it to them. Do not list a item as acceptable, if it isn't and having almost five ripped pages is not acceptable."
4,one of my favs,"This Madaris book is one of my favorites of Mrs. Jackson. I already read it at the library, but wanted for my collection to read again. Sir Warren is the tuff take no crap hero, and Victoria is determined not to be just sit and be passive."
3,"It was alright, not the best Brenda Jackson book","This one, I can honestly say this isn't my favorite BJ novel. I just didn't like the story line too much. It just seems unbelievable to me. I didn't like how she finally told Drake who she really was, his reaction was too unreal. I don't know, it was good but not that great. I still love Brenda though, I haven't given up on her at all."
4,Homecoming is a feel good movie,"I watched this movie with our whole family, all 3 generations, and we all thought it was quite good and enjoyable, well worth the price. It was well acted and the kid's were adorable. I love movies that tug at your heart."
5,If you don't watch it you're denying a great movie,"If you like the book, you'll LOVE the movie! Homecoming is just about the sweetest movie I've ever seen in my life, and it's got to be one of my favorites, too. It's impossible to find - but if you find it, go for it! There won't be a dry eye, though, I can tell you that!"
5,Homecoming,Why is this movie soooooo hard to find on VHS/DVD? I love it so much. I ordered it 5+ years ago and accidentally scratched it and a few parts of the DVD are screwed up. THIS MOVIE IS PHENOMENAL! :)
5,Expensive,Why is this movie so costly? Its not like theres differant episodes or continuations. Its just one movie. Good grief.
2,Brilliant performances,"This movie is very close to the novel by Cynthia Voigt. The children have acted very well and you feel everything is real. The grandmother played by Anne Bancroft is simply too good. She is equally well complimented by Dicey , the eldest of the kids who is in fact the central character. Kimberlee Peterson gives an extraordinary portrayal of this character. Hats off to the makers of this beautiful emotion packed movie.Paresh Pai,Goa India"
2,miscast,faithful but boring and nuance free adaptation of the bookI think they lost the chance to cast someone interestingly sharp faced and olive skinned as Dicey Tillerman. Camilla Bell in The Quiet and Kristen Stewart in Panic Room looked closer to the character than the girl who was cast in this film. The book is really good but I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone.
4,did a good job of keeping to the book,"I thought this movie was very similar to the wonderful book by Cynthia Voigt, except that they took out a lot. But they left in all the really important details and some of the same lines, too. Anne Bancroft did a superb job as Gram! I liked the child actors, too, especially the girl who played Dicey. I really liked this movie, but you definitely have to read the book first."
4,I loved this movie.,"When i first saw this movie advertised on tv I was so excited. I'd read the books as a teenager and had such fond memories that it was like seeing a long forgotten photo of a dear friend. I sat back that night and eagerly waited for it to start but when it did, I was horrified. Dicey was nothing like I had expected, she didn't even look like a boy which was the whole point of the book, I was so disappointed that I almost turned the thing off. I decided to give it 5 more minutes, if for no other reason than to have a good moan. In that 5 minutes, it won me over. The acting was wonderful: it wasn't over acted, overly dramatic or overly sentimental and when Anne Brancroft came on the scene I laughed and laughed. Her portrayal of the grandmother who lets the children into her heart in spite of herself is alone worth watching. Oh, and the end of this movie has one of the most beautifully understated moments I've seen in a movie in a long time."
5,The only knife you'll ever need,"My first L-1 lasted me for >5 years of near daily use in the trades. It has a slimmer profile than the handsaver models (and fits in my belt better) and is nearly bulletproof. Being able to extend the blade an inch or two is great for tasks like cutting insulation, something you couldn't do w/ an ordinary utility knife. Also, you can limit the depth of cut to 1/8"" or so for detail scoring when you don't want your knife to get away from you (also much safer when scoring the backside of a drywall snap)The best part: Stanley is now making blades that will fit this knife (more expensive, harder to snap) - these work nicely in a pinch but I haven't found them in bulk like the Olfa blades."
4,Wonderful Book,Excellent book for anyone starting a business moving on to the next level. Gives a vbery intensive view of the position of the CFO and their responsibilities. Brought out many of the details of the position often overlooked. Kudos to the authors.
2,Doesn't help much,"I had been using this with myCanon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Standard & Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, but found it didn't really help block any stray light and ended up getting theCanon ES71II Lens Hood for EF 50mm f/1.4 SLR Lens, even though it's much more expensive.However, my friend has this same lens hood with aCanon EF 28mm f/1.8 USM Wide Angle Lens for Canon SLR Camerasand it seems to be just enough. So I think the moral is, if you have a wider-angle lens, this will work fine for you."
5,A great two in one!,I've had this dual for over a year and I love it! I haven't had one problem! This was one of first combos in the market so anything new from this brand name can only get better!
2,Didn't last long,"The DVD player on this unit skipped a lot, couldn't handle many rental discs well, and eventually just got too annoying so I gave it to a neighbor and bought a cheapo unit elsewhere. I liked having the combo package but got too frustrated with skipping during DVD playback."
1,it's often what they DON'T say...,"One of the reasons i wanted a combo unit was to view and convert dvds from grandchildren's recitals and other performances. I found out that MOST combo units do NOT read DVD-R or DVD RW. they only read commercial dvds. I just spent [a lot of money] on a dvd burner. with apple selling all these imovie tools and superdrives to burn dvds where is anyone going to be able to play them? Let's face it, we'd like to view our masterpieces on our tv...not a 17in computer screen. i am SOOOO disappointed. I've been searching for days for an alternative and still haven't found one that ready DVD-R!"
1,Stay away from this unit,Finally got the time to setup this unit and the VCR tape transport eats tapes. Unfortunately I am just beyond the 90 day warranty so I am out of luck. The DVD ouput is fine through the SVHS cable but the VCR output which is a standard RCA cable is terrible. It is hard to justify spending the money on repairing the defective transport when the VCR output is such a miserable quality. Since the company is in Chapter 11 and the assets are changing hands you would be wise to find another manufacturer.
1,"""Concept"" is good But Quality is lacking!","Item was defective out of the box. Customer Service wasr not helpful at all. Tech Support people know ONLY how to tell you to check the cable connections(speaker, video etc.)--Even after I insisted that the problem was ""DVD Draw Does NOT open""-- This is after trying to understand them--TERRIBLE LITTLE ENGLISH!Their So-called Service centers (in FL at least) are run by independent shops and are REALLY BAD! The shops apparently have a bad working relationship with GOVIDEO and therfore do not want to do service. CAVEAT EMPTOR! RUN when you see one of this company's products. For a couple of dollars more you can get a ""REAL BRAND NAME"" and you will be happier. That is what I ended up doing(bought a Brand Name). One Year later Still have problems ...It only works as a VCR not DVD+VCR"
2,New York Times rated this number 1??,"The DVD play back is outstanding, though the 360 degree round button used for fast forward and rewind is tough to master.My unit started failing on the sound playback of Videotapes. Sound got softer then quit completely. I cleaned the heads, to no avail. It must go for repair, warranty is only 90 days for labor, one year for parts. Estimated repair labor is $60.00I recommend not buying any DVD/ VCR without a 1 year warranty. For [item price] I would have expected this unit to function for at least a year! I have a 10 year old VCR and an 8 year old one that still work fine, cannot understand why a 6 month old VCR should fail.Note also that the instruction manual that comes with this does not address all questions, and that online manual is just a .pdf of the printed one. This forces you to call the 800 number, with waits of up to 30 minutes on hold, to get your questions answered."
1,poor work,"I did not hate it, please replace that word Amazon.It's a poor collection of recommendations from many book. No medical valueI do not recommend it.S."
3,1801 Home Remedies,This little book is loaded with old-timie and proved remedies for various ailments. So rather than running to the phone to go to the emergency room or bother my doctor I check out the symptoms in this book. Glad Amazon has it available.
3,not what i expected,"i've always wanted to have a home remedies book so i thought i'd give this one a try. unfortunately, it wasn't what i expected. several of the remedies required a lot of herbal and natural products. things that a young couple don't usually have!"
4,"Basic Binoculars, reasonable price, sufficient power","Bought these binoculars to be able to get a better look at the blimps, hot air balloons, and birds from my home, but also needed something to get a better view of the far end zone at Giant's Stadium. Nothing elaborate about these binoculars, but perfect for my needs."
3,OK for the money...,"I wasn't expecting a great set of binoculars, so my excellence bar was already set low when I ordered them. They work about as well as you would expect a set of binoclars to work at this price. It was drizzling alot in the woods where I was hiking which caused them to fog up from time to time."
4,Bushnell Powerview 16x32 Compact Folding Roof Prism Binocular,Great when I'm sitting out in the bleachers although has have been mentioned by others you have a very steady hand to keep view from bobbing.
1,TERRIBLE,"First, I wished I had checked the reviews before purchasing! I have owned other Bushnell Binoculars, but these are by far the worst I have used. I took an Alaska trip and nearly every time I used the binoculars it was necessary to re-focus both lenses. I would not recommend these at all, there are many better pairs of binoculars on the market for a comparable price."
4,Bushnell Binoculars,"Great magnification.Lightweight & folds somewhat compactly. Used it to see Radio City Spectacular sitting in the rafters. Turned my seat into an orchestra seat! I got to see the Rockettes as 50 foot giants!Just a couple of concerns: sometimes it enlarged too much, I had to lower them to find what I wanted to see. Also, be wary of dim lit places, or you may not see much through the lens. Certainly pleased with it. The amount of money I saved from purchasing the least expensive seat over the pricey orchestra seat more than covers the price I paid for these binoculars!!!"
4,Good Quality Binoculars for average overall use.,"These Binoculars are great for average users. Well worth the price. They are powerful enough to give you good close-up views that usually require much bulkier and heavier binoculars. They are compact enough to make them very portable and come with a nice soft storage case that can be attached to your belt. The focus works well for me but you do have to have a pretty steady hand to see clearly. I sometimes lean on things if necessary. They can fog up in High Humidity conditions (like most others do). I think you have to pay much more and get larger ones to get past these issues. Overall, good quality for the price compared to others on the market."
4,"Nice, but powerful binocular","We got these to watch humpback whale migrations here in Hawaii, because those whales don't get that close to shore usually. These are nice binoculars, but they are pretty powerful and as such are hard to look through unless you steady them on something while looking. Just holding them in your hands they are difficult to use for my purpose. If I rest them on the car, though, I can see whales just fine! I am not sure I would buy them again though, because for casual use, they are too annoying to use."
3,okay,"during the daylight hours they are great, but the last hour of the day they are of no use. Paul"
4,Good Buy,This was a great bargain for a mid range pair of binoculars and my son has enjoyed using them.
1,"JUNK--DON""T BUY This PCof Crap...........",These are Junk Binos --really the worst I haver ever seen--JUNK --You have been warned! Buy the wide angle ones instead--you will be happier!
2,it wasn't what i was expecting,"I was expecting something simple in concept and practice. There's too much channeled theory, and less practical exercises which I was hoping this book contained"
2,Gift was returned,"I bought this as a gift for my brother. My two brothers tried using it and both found it to be distorted. It worked better with only using one eye! We think it was off or something. I honestly cannot speak about the actual issue, but just understand that my brother put me through the hassle of returning it. Well, it was hardly a hassle because Amazon made it quite easy. Thank you Amazon!"
2,Too heavy for me,One minute is the longest I can hold these before my arms get tired. I admit I'm not the strongest person in the world but now I have to look for another pair that's lighter. The quality of the lenses were fine.
1,"These are poor, poor quality items.","I ordered 3 of these as Christmas giftd for my 3 grandchildren. After just a few minutes of use 2 of these have double vision. Each ""barrel"" seems to be pointing at slightly different points. Very poor quality items."
3,nice thing with the small money,It is nice binocular for the small use with the nice shape and nice focusing ability..... I can fairly recommend to other to use..
3,smhach,Nice set of binoculars that produce a nice clear image for the novice user and the price is right. Unfortunately the lens covers are not attached so losing them is just a matter of time. It would have gotten another star if it had a mounting screw hole for my tripod since I'm using them for star gazing and they are a little bulky.
1,"Ignore the other reviews, this item is horrible","All of the positive reviews really fooled me on this one.First, the item came pre-broken. One of the magnifying end-tubes was detached. After screwing it back on I discovered that something else was broken inside of the binnoculars causing a terrible rattle. So I sent it back for a refund. Oh yeah, and it was horribly packed and the US portal service had it for a week.But that isn't the reason I am providing negative feedback. The thing is all plastic, and not the good kind. The image provided is small and grainy - probably due to the plastic optics. The people giving positive reviews of the image quality have apparently never even used a moderately good pair of binnoculars. I am not talking about expensive binnocs, the cheapest thing that Nikon makes will blow these away. These are essentially a toy and I can see why Amazon has dropped the price so low."
5,real crisp,This is one excellent binocular. Easy to focus and the clarity of the lens are outstanding. My wife said she can even see the tiny dots or specks on the bird 100 yards away on a clear day. Thank you Amazon for the excellent deal.
1,Horrible product,"Received a pair as a gift, it came with double vision. Returned it through amazon and got a new pair, but stupidly didn't open and check them...because who would ever dream you'd have a problem with two in a row right? So wrong! Got the new pair out for a camping trip this summer to discover double vision again! Too late to return to amazon, so I contacted Bushnell...no response. Tried again and finally got an email telling me to ship it to them for evaluation with a check for $15 for return shipping. Utterly useless. Just skip this product. Skip Bushnell and their lame customer service altogether."
4,Well Worth the cost,"I am a rookie bird-watcher and I would recommend this pair of binoculars for bird-watching/binocular astronomy. It can be used to track birds in flight with comparitive ease, and this is a big plus. The insta-focus is a nice concept, especially in winter when the standard knob that binoculars usually have, is a nuisance. The weight, too, is quite manageable.I found this adequate for most birding, except for things like identifing small birds in dim light. For this, a 7x binoculars is what is usually recommended. But, this binoculars is a happy middle-path if you are also considering some binocular astronomy, since the aperture size is good.However, there was a great deal of misting over of the lens, in damp conditions (in my case, on the Applachian trail in Tennessee). This might be a detriment in wet weather birding (waders?). Also, the shoulder strap is quite thin.Overall, a good buy considering the low cost."
3,Good Quality,"I like the quality on this binoculars.First pair and none other to compare to, but is it normal to have double vision? Is it adjustable? or is this a defect pair? i really like the build of this binocular. planning to use it for hiking trip in future."
3,Fine Resolution,The binoculars works fine. The resolution its ok. The product it's a little heavy. There was no catalogue in the box related to the way to install the strip and other details.
2,Not good enough,"Several years ago I bought a pair of Bushnell 10X50 binoculars and to this day they are amazing. So, when it was time to buy a pair for a family member I decided to buy another pair of Bushnell 10X50. Unfortunately, I did not understand the specs of binoculars and the field of view of the new pair is much, much smaller than the old pair. I also noticed that the new pair were made in China and the old were made in the Phillipines. Maybe the manufacturing differences between the factories has something to do with it?Anyway, I highly recommend trying the binoculars of choice at a store and then order. Do not go by the specs!"
1,These binoculars are dreadful,"I bought these binoculars based on the many five-star reviews and the fact that they are from a reputable manufacturer. I immediately returned them because they were defective out of the box: the collimation was ""off"" (i.e., the left and right telescopes are not aimed at the same point, causing the viewer to see two laterally separated images instead of a single stereoscopic image); and not just a bit off, but way off. The manufacturing process for this product must be totally devoid of any QA. Based on the one-star reviews (which I wish I had paid attention to before placing my order) mentioning the same collimation problem, your chances of getting a bad item are probably in the region of 1 in 10."
1,Seeing double,Bought two- both were not collimated properly and had to be returned. Must not be much quality control at Bushnell these days.
3,Ok for beginners,I was not knowledgeable about the magnification of a binocular. Brought it anyways as a beginner. Magnifies objects well within say half a mile.
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting too much for the inexpensive price. However, the lens caps are so poorly formed that they fall off the small side lens by mere gravity. A light breeze could blow them right off. It isn't really worth the trouble to send them back so I will figure out a way to make the lens caps to stay where they are supposed to and I will use some kind of lanyard to keep them attached to the binoculars whether they are covering the lenses or not. My father has a pair that has this feature that he purchased in the early 1960's. It would cost a few cents per pair to incorporate this simple yet useful feature. The optics are what is to be expected from a $30.00 pair of binoculars which is not so good, but good enough to satisfy my meager needs. Something I will take with me when I go hiking. I gave two stars because of the lens caps."
4,Instruction sheet joke,"The joke is that the instructions are in type so small it's difficult to read them even with magnifying (reading) glasses! That's a good one, huh? Of course, you can't use the binoculars to read the instructions unless you shoot them to the top of your roof. Har deh har! I'm just sorry I won't live to see the 20-year-old, insert-writing smartass with perfect eyes get his ocular comeuppance one day!"
1,defective out of the box,the front lens housing came detached from the body...returned it immediately...I think Amazon just sends any defective piece to meet the 2 day shipping promise...very disappointed with the transaction
2,I meant to return these.,"Poor design. There was glue all over the lens. The entire left eye piece fell of with the first good use of them. It goes back on. Focus likes to move. Once I cleaned them up they were OK. I take a couple binocs to NASCAR races. I always lend these ones out now. Everyone else seems to like them just fine (expect when the eye piece falls off and I blame them for it) Like I said, once I cleaned them up they were usable. They are a little bulky for what I needed them for but that has nothing to do with the two stars."
1,Dead on arrival,"The screw holding the binoculars was unscrewed when I got the product in the mail. The thing was falling apart! I didn't want to mess with it, so I sent it back. Don't they have any quality control?"
4,Retired & Lovin' It!,"Got it for less than $25.00 last week, new from Beach Camera thru Amazon. Works well, also bought ""L"" adapter for Tri-Pod mount, less than $13.00 w/shipping.For less than 40 bucks, good binocs plus mount, casual user but do wish some quality, yes made in China, not thrilled but product sturdy & WORKS!Can't go wrong, your call.......Bushnell Falcon 10x50 Wide Angle Binoculars (Black)"
2,Sloppy Assembly,"The binocular assembly was sloppy and shows a lack of care and review of the final product.One of the lenses was not screwed in correctly and in another there was a loose prism. Both problems were easy to solve with a small screwdriver and screwing the lens in place, but this shows a lack of diligence in assembly."
1,Buyer's regret due to cheap parts,"Based on the good reviews that I read here, I was expecting the same quality of another Bushnell that I bought for my son a decade ago. Unfortunately, this model came apart once I pulled it out of the box. The focus lever stopped working because the eyepiece attachments to the focus lever were secured by a cheap & thin plastic washer that crumbled at first use. I could have asked for a refund, but preferred to fix it using a custom-fit metal wash, attached to the original plastic cap with strong epoxy glue. I hope that it'll now hold for many years. I would not have bought it however if I knew that its plastic parts were so weak."
1,3 binoculars with the same problem,"I bought 3 of these at the same time for my wife and kids. All 3 came with one of the barrels not attached correctly, you could see a gab between the barrel and the body. This caused them to be out of collimation (made you see double). Bushnell is usually a quality manufacture, but with all 3 binoculars with the same problem, I can only assume it was not a fluke. I would recommend a different brand, there are other quality brands with similar price binoculars."
2,Malfunction,"I'm a total amateur using binoculars, so it took me some time to get used to focus clearly, however, I quickly discovered that focusing shouldn't be so hard, and then realized that the product had a defect in one of the objectives. It was twisted a little bit to the left, so it always made hard to visualize correctly and you needed to give some space between your eyes and the binos.I really don't recommend the product."
2,Packed poorly and...Eye piece fell off.,"Packed poorly and the words ""unbelievable"" came out we it fell apart coming out of the box on father's day. When lens cap came off one lens fell out. Adjustment rubber fell of as glue seemed dried out and not good. Eye piece fell off."
5,Just Excellent,"First time buy/owner of a 10x50 binoculars and I was not disappointed at all. Was hesitant due to some negative reviews, but mine came in prestine shape and excellent working condition. Needed right away for a sporting event in which I was going to be seated far away. My friend that came along with me was impressed and might get one himself too. Must get for anyone looking for a high quality, easy to use binocular. The InstaFocus lever on this binocular made it more convienent than past binoculars I've used/own."
3,Hard to focus,Seems like the lens aren't quite lined up somehow. Maybe it is supposed to take quite of bit of time and effort but I don't think so.
4,really great item!,"I bought this item for a present, and the person REALLY liked it!!. He uses it to watch deer, and other animals. The focus is very good, and I am very happy that I bought this product!!"
1,Poorly collimated,"I received these binoculars poorly collimated(both sets of glass aligned to same target), as there are no user accessible adjustment screws and doing the work to open them up and repair them would cost more than these cost brand new, they're now trash. Looking through individual lenses they appeared serviceable for the price although the focus adjustment was hitting the plastic pieces of the body."
1,Big disappointment!!,"I recently purchased 2 pair of these based on good reviews. I was expecting much more! The first pair literally fell apart in my hands while focusing on the 3rd day that I used them. I am a 30 something adult, and these were handled only by an adult and carried in a totebag. The second pair, though it remained in one piece, would not focus acceptably. Everything was magnified but blurred. I was always in fear these would fall apart like the first. I ended up returning both items and wishing I had put out the extra money for a better quality binocular."
5,Bushnell 10/50 Binoculars,Was very pleased with these glasses. Very clear view from close-in to far-off. Believe that they are a great value at this price.
4,THE BEAUTIFUL FALLING LEAVES......,"Autumn with its riot of reds, oranges, and golds lends itself to glorious full color illustrations depicting the changes that take place during that time of year. Susan Swan brings young eyes a bounty of fall shades as she paints leaves falling from the trees, seeds falling from the last of the sunflowers, and apples falling from branches.True to its title author Nidey mentions falling temperatures when youngsters reach for warmer clothes, and even football players falling into the end zone.With autumn, of course, comes Halloween and festivals and the fun that accompanies each of these events.""When Autumn Falls"" is an eye catching way for very young readers to become familiar with and learn to appreciate this special time of year.- Gail Cooke"
4,Extrordanary Indeed,"If you enjoy fast paced,thrilling, action packed bookes, this is the book for you. Its about a boy named Alfred Kropp whos life keeps getting worse by the minute. His life does not get much better when he and his uncle steal Excalibur, a legendary sword. Now he must keep this sword out of the hands of an evil man.This book is great when it comes to action! Jets, ships, guns, swords, castles, knights, and even a pretty girl are included in this book.The only problem is that there are a lot of characters. Its hard to keep track of them.Over all, its a wonderful book. I would recommend this book to anyone that loves action."
3,Not Exciting,"For a book that's supposed to be exciting -- 15-year-old Alfred must retrieve the magical sword Excalibur, and then must retrieve it a second time from somebody bent on using it to take over the world -- this one isn't. There's a certain feeling of dullness and drabness in this book, a kind of plodding onward but without exciting ups and downs. Interesting premise, but the story just didn't come to life for me."
5,I need more adventures!,"I wasn't really expecting much when I picked the book up. The plot summary seemed...entertaining at best. But I was in for a pleasant surprise when I read it! I couldn't put it down.The greatness of the heroes(especially Benaccio; he was my absolute favorite character, by far!) and the wickedness of the villains was a perfect classic story set up. With a few sweet cars in there too. Knights have to travel in style, you know."
3,Kropp the loser...,"This is a decent book. Has loads of action and adventure. Which keeps the reader going from page 1. What I didn't care for as the book went on is Alfred's narration. He's a selfproclaimed loser and everything is his fault. As the book neared the end I was wondering if he would ever stop putting himself down, stop telling you he's slow on the uptake, stop acting sulky with a feel-sorry-for-me attitude. When the situation demands it Alfred step's up to the plate, but the rest of the time he's sulking around. It started out great with his humor and I laughed out loud but it didn't hold that through the book. The reading is easy and pageturning. However, I won't be reading the sequel as I don't think I take anymore of his loser attitude."
1,Extremely predictable with poor writing,"This book was overall very disappointing. It was horribly predictable, had many irrelevant parts, and was highly illogical at times. It was easily among the worst fantasy novels, and failed at delivering from a unique and interesting premise. Almost no character development, with relatively poorly written scenes, make for a bad novel."
4,If you stop at 6:40 it's the best Voyager episode ever,"Okay okay I'm just kidding, I don't hate Neelix that much. As a matter of fact I really enjoyed this episode. I wish this version of Neelix was the Neeix we always see...he has real emotions, he's not always brown-nosing and sucking up to everyone. To me the ""normal"" Neelix is so fake and happy all the damn time...nobody is like that, no one is that 2 dimensional and robotic. Well...actually there are some people I know like that in the real world, but those people are just suppressing all the things they truly feel and they end up becoming serial killers and so on."
5,my fav episode,"i have seen every episode of TNG, DS9, and Voyager and this is probably my favorite episode, even though its when kes leaves, and she is one of my fav people. but Seven is my fav person too. i feel bad for Neelix. but, they could have made her leave a different way. this way was kinda weird. and there should have been more after-math at the end. it was over too soon. this was an amazing episode, and voyager is my fav. series."
2,Medical experi,At first the story of an invisible group of scientists doing medical experiments on the crew seems exciting... especially with the medical CGI employed in the teaser. Unfortunately the episode ultimately is a let down when we learn little to nothing about the invisible race. They and their experiments are quickly resolved and somewhat dismissed.
5,star trek fan,"missed many of thr original shows due to work schedule, also long time ago so now like new shows again."
3,Good not Great,"Star Trek: Voyager was not my favorite ST series but it had its moments. Season 4 is when the show started to get good IMO and there are definitely some memorable episodes this season. However, Voyager did not have great continuity or character development throughout its seven-season run and S4 is equally hit-or-miss with the whole of the series. This is the only season of Voyager I own, along with one of each of the others, and it's likely to stay that way until I can find an inexpensive and simple way to obtain all the eps I like on DVD in lieu of entire seasons. If you're a fan and own the first three seasons I'd say why not continue, otherwise save your money and catch the reruns, if there's a channel that even plays this show anymore."
2,Massive Continuity Error,"As storyline and episodes go, pretty good. A little too much on the old trick of ""oh, this was really just a fake time loop time line, so blow up the bad guys and everything will be golden again"". Of course, they used that in ""Enterprise"" too, to get rid of the entire Temporal Cold War, but at least they had to explain away a lot of stuff anyway.Now, what is the problem? By stardates, Kes had done the traveling backwards in time trick and specifically told the tale to the Voyager crew six months before (Before & After), which suddenly everyone in the crew forgot about. Real convenient there guys and real stupid. Then after all the darkness, brutality and mayhem amid normally bright people with sudden forgetfulness, bring out the happy time.It is reported that this was supposed to be the bridge between seasons three & four, but was bumped by the two part ""Scorpion"". It should have stayed bumped."
4,"you might not like the deceptive quality of the episode, but you might like that most if you like irony","I have seen worse Voyager episodes. I rate them on how much I was interested in watching as the episode proceeded. This one has kept my interest just fine. I kind of like it. The ""war"" finds Chakotay being drawn in by people who you can also come to 'like'. The episode is somewhat about being manipulated and as usual takes on many star trek meta-ethics issues, you'll see after you watch it."
5,Now that's what I'm talking 'bout,"Finally a good episode, AND IT HAS CONTINUITY?! NO it can't be?!?!The doctor is reactivated 700 years in the future, and only he can set the record straight and clear up slander against Voyager. It so beautifully ties into events we've seen on the series already (If you weren't paying attention you might not get why), and it's actually clever writing for once. I was beginning to lose hope that Voyager would ever be good again, but here's an excellent redemption."
4,Sneaky Medical Experiments,"I've got to disagree strongly with the other reviewer here. This episode had me on the edge of my seat until the end; unlike a lot of Voyager episodes, it was unpredictable and light on the techno-babble (thank god!). So just watch it! Seven and the Doc tag team those aliens and Janeway goes SHE HULK! GET EM! :DI want to say more, but I won't because unlike other reviewers I don't like spoiling the entire episode."
5,Excellent season!,"The fourth season of Voyager is one of the best. Season four marks the introduction of Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine in ""Scorpion, part II"" and Jennifer Lien's character Kes leaving in ""The Gift."" The two parter ""Year of Hell"" is by far the best Voyager episode(s) ever produced. Other excellent offerings are ""Scientific Method,"" ""Message in a Bottle,"" ""The Killing Game,"" ""Living Witness,"" and ""Hope and Fear.""Voyager is my favorite Star Trek series, and the fourth season is a must have for any Voyager fan."
5,The REAL beginning for the series - Season 4,"I am a Star Trek fan. I have watched the saga since age 5. When Voyager began I was so glad to see another updated vessel on a mission. Unlike some other fans I was bored with DS9. Voyager really takes off in season 4 with some excellent episodes. The season contains what is reported to be one of the cast's favorites - Killing Game I & II. Seven is probably the best Star Trek character EVER and this is where it began - SEASON 4. The writing and storyline improved and the character building was, I believe, better than any other Star Trek series. The character building was also excellent. Season 4 contains 2 fantastic 2 parters - Year of Hell - which is an excellent time based story and the already mentioned Killing Game - a great portrayal of sci-fi/realism that is plausible and entertaining. Season 4 and 5 are the BEST overall for Voyager."
5,Year of Hell!,"The 'Year of Hell' episodes were awesome. This episode, I think, is second only Season 3's 'Future's End'. I love Voyager, and I love 7 of 9 of course. (Who doesn't?) If you don't know about Voyager, Season 4 is a great place to start, since this is when the series really got going. Although some episodes are better than others, this season and this series is definitely one of the best!...VOYAGER!"
4,Janeway and Chekotay Sitting in a Tree,"The whole show is rich tapestry of ethical dilemmas, intergalactic communication conundrums, and just plain dopeness! Watch it! Or be assimilated by lameness."
2,Lazy lazy lazy writing,"Once again Janeway endangers the entire crew of Voyager to protect a complete stranger they just met; and once again she asks her subordinate to make the call...why? She's the flippin' captain. They were still trying to figure out if she was the ""bad guy"" or not and they were already sacrificing all their lives to save hers and firing upon aliens before they knew if they were innocent or guilty...It's seems like a while since a Voyager episode was actually good, let's hope the next one is worthy."
4,"We have all the ""Voyagers""","No much to say ... you're either a ""Voyager"" fan, as we are, or you are not. EXCELLENT transfer to DVD and ... as with the entire series ... great extras. Make sure, on all the ""Special Features,"" you use your arrow keys to find all the Easter Eggs. We just use the right arrow, and it toggles around to them all. They are mostly short cast interviews.We have found the packaging to be difficult to manipulate since the box comes in two pieces. Difficult to close properly (remember, the top goes INSIDE the bottom!). Also, be cautious when you pull any box apart (from any of the seven seasons). Disc 1 is laid bare with no protective cover over it"
2,Formulaic Voyager: 2.5 out of 5,"Is the Alien friendly when the Voyager crew first meets him?YesThen he will always try to kill someone or steal somethingThe EndThe concept of this one is alright (DNA thief) but the execution and miraculous techno-babble ending make it fall flat BIG TIME. ""We could use a chronoton inductive phase shifted beam to overload the coaxial drive""...yea how many times have we heard that? YIPEE!"
3,Janeway ignores prime directive again,"Janeway logic:Break Prime directive and give aliens holodeck technology...But turns down multiple chances to get home because it might break prime directive :|This...show.....Aside from the huge deficit in logic, this was not worthy of a 2-parter. I just didn't find it interesting enough and the setting felt holo *pun intended*"
5,Consider this...,"They should name the new series ""Star Trek: Doomsday""... not just to be dramatic, but so that the new acronym can be ""STD"". HAHAHAHAHA!"
4,Star Trek: Voyager Season 4,"Star Trek: Voyager Season 4 is perhaps one of my favorite season of the voyager series. I was glad when Amazon lowered their prices for the series, I went and purchased this set."
5,Excellent and Surprising Book,"I am reading this book now, and, as a Catholic convert of many years, I find it both enlightening and surprising. It affirms for me, once again, that Holy Mother Church is guided by the Holy Spirit. Otherwise, given all the weaknesses and scandals of some of her leaders, she would have fallen into oblivion centuries ago. An excellent read!"
4,Roots was a gift for someone,"As I did not read any of this book, it is hard for me to give a review. This book was purchased as a gift for my sister."
5,Well written mystery with developed characters,"Michael Nava does not settle for the typical uni-dimensional sleuth in mystery stories. His character, Henry Rios, is real flesh and blood, going through an emotional break-up with a boyfriend during the worst times of AIDS in California, confronting issues about his own violent father, facing his own homosexuality as he strives to be tops in his legal defense field (as well as a TOP we learn in one scene). Regular fans will enjoy the cameo appearances of his office staff and investigator, as well as Josh, the sick ex- boyfriend. Anyone familiar with the recovery programs (AA etc) will love the scenes from the rehab center and quotes and references to ""The Program"". I am always treated by Nava's literary references, this time, a poem of W.H. Auden. Nava always manages to make the court stuff real, as well as the Los Angeles locale of this story. You'll want more when you reach the last page."
3,Enjoyable read,"The Hidden Law was the second mystery I have read by Michael Nava. It is a quick and engaging read, but it is nothing spectacular. Mr. Nava's greatest strength is in fleshing out his characters, and he does an excellent job in The Hidden Law, especially with his main character, Henry Rios. The plot was a bit weak to me though and the coincidences a few too many for this to be a really good book. If you are looking for something fast and rather mindless, this would be a good choice."
4,Henry Rios rules,I read How Town first and then decided to give other books in this series a try. Loved it. Read it on a 5 hour train ride and couldn't put it down. I just bought the first book in the series and am planning on reading it next.
3,a well written but rather empty mystery novel..,"Without a doubt Michael Nava is a fine writer. His prose is great, dialogue is sharp, and he has a great eye for detail. Unfortunately in this effort he seemingly forgot to develop a compelling story. A murder mystery surrounding a sleazy politician is a great premise. But the author dwells too much on the personal issues of the investigating attorney, which is fairly boring, and does a miserable job in trying to build any sort of suspense. The twist at the end of the book was very ho-hum.Bottom line: Michael Nava produces a dud. Missable."
5,Hefty funnel,Large nice quality funnel. A must for a heavy duty shop. Great for pouring from a 5 gallon bucket. Would highly recommend if u have the clearance for such a hefty funnel.
3,Perfect large funnel,This is a large funnel so it will not stand upright on an angled opening but it works great on flatter openings.
4,Bigger than the picture makes it to be.,This is exactly what I needed to put gas into the generator and snow plow. Helps to stop the spash over and mess.
4,Funnel,The only thing that would be helpful would be to add a dust cover to help keep it clean after use.
4,Giant Funnel,It is BIG. Comes with a screen filter too. Very sturdy and well built. Spout could have been a little longer
4,Used as my primary funnel,"The funnel comes with a. screen which can be popped out. Because of the screen I use it as my primary funnel fun to add fuel to my lawnmowers and motorcycles and occasionally my cars. I am surprised what stuff comes out of my gas cans.I had to add an extension hose to fill my cars. The homemade extension helps me see around the funnel to see the level of fuel better to avoid an over fill, but that still happens because sometimes I pour too much fuel into the funnel and it drains slowly into the tank. I wish it had an overflow stop mechanism."
1,Repetitive and uninteresting,Bought this for my 5.5 year old. Unengaging...there are definitely better books on bullying. The concept in the book is positive.
2,Dirty little secrets....,"You won't care you know.... There's nothing in this book that qualifies as a 'dirty little secret'. ""Dirty Secrets"" are supposed to be titillating, shocking or at least something you can't find out by watching the History Channel for an evening. This book would have been better off titled ""Boring Things About the World's Military"" or ""I Wrote a Book of Facts! Aren't You Impressed Yet?"""
3,Not as great as Limite,"I am a Limite fan and I was so looking forward to this cd, but was very disapointed when I got it.I enjoyed the song mentirosa, but the rest of the songs were ok. I really did not like the song ""limite"", Alicia did a much better job with this song live in concert.The cd is ok, but it is not as great as the Limite cds. It is just not the same without Alicia as the lead singer.This is just my opinion, my friend actually loves this cd."
1,"Euforia is nothing compared to "" Limite""","I purchased this CD thinking it would be the same or similar to "" Limite "" but the truth is that it doesn't sound the same, as much as they try they can't be even near as good as they were with Alicia. The distinguished voice of Alicia Villarreal is what made them "" Limite "", in the other hand you should buy Alicia's new CD 'cause it's really good."
1,Just plain shoddy,Cheap wood. Shoddy construction. Pads started coming loose after only one day. Thought it would be a step up from beginner paddles at Wal-Mart but it was a step down.
5,Super Cuddly!,This lion is super cuddly and floppy. I consider these excellent attributes in a stuffie. All the kids I've gotten these for have loved them and I have one myself. Everyone can use a friendly lion!
3,Love it but it sheds,"I would love to be able to keep this toy as I think it's super cute. However, the fur comes out. I returned it as it's not safe for my baby."
3,Looks great but a nightmare to put together...,"This island looks great when put together but I would like to know how anyone could call it 'easy to assemble'. I'm an interior designer who has put my share of furniture together, and this island was a nightmare. It took almost 4 hours for 2 of us to assemble because there are so many parts that had to be perfectly lined up and balanced just right before you could move on to the next step. I love it now that it is done, but would have paid more for a fully assembled island had I known how much work went into this."
4,Perfect for exploring the nature,"that binocular is really strong and portable , is small but you can see very far, i used for watch birds and nature. i recommend 100%!"
3,"too small, tiny even, eye relief is a significant problem","I got these after redaing numerous reviews saying how small and convenient these are. well they are small, not convenient. i wear both glasses and contacts. With contacts, as in bare eyes, I found the eye relief to be a huge problem in getting binocular vision, as in both eyes. Was mostly getting monocular vision, and had to do a lot of adjustment every time to get binocular vision. So no, small is not always better.Magnification is really good, field of view is poor, which i knew. Optics are good, fully coated.I wouldnt pay retail for these, glad i got a marketplace item for 12-13$"
2,Broke on the first day of use,"First evening I decided to test it and look at the moon. :)While adjusting the focus left rubber handle (with lens) came off,so for the rest of the trip I had to use as monocle. :)"
2,Shoddy,"In a year the mechanism for holding the separation stopped working, the lens coating broke down and the focus mechanism failed."
2,Think About it,"Ordered these binoculars intending to use them when hiking or trail riding, wanted something small and compact. They are small, (about 5"" in length & 3"" wide when folded) and they are lite weight. But the quality of view was terrible. It might be OK for sitting on the porch looking at a bird in the back yard, (providing you have pretty steady hands), but that's about all. I immediately returned them to Amazon, and they are very good about that. I just wished I had thought about what to expect for $18 binoculars."
4,Basic entry level pair,I paid $20 & prime shipping. This was a deal. They are useful for basic scouting around while camping. They are made in China. Easy to use. Seem like decent quality for the money. Easy to focus with the center wheel. String is attached to carry around your nexk. The have a cloth pouch with a belt loop. These are not for a survivalist doing recon missions. They are great for kids and basic use.
1,You get what you pay for.,"I had a pair of these and used them for years. Finally the ""hinge"" became completely loose on one side, so that that side swung loose, making it impossible to maintain the interpupilary [between-the-eyes] distance. So I bought another pair here. On the new pair, the right and left side were focused so differently that no amount of adjusting could bring both sides into focus on the same object. It's probably a matter of quality control. That's why this item has received such differing ratings here, from five stars to one star. So you have two choices -- gamble $20 that these will work when you get them, or just go ahead and spend more money in the first place and buy something that is sure to work. I spent about twice the price of these for a pair of Bushnell Powerview 12x25 Porro Prism Binoculars. I took a chance going with Bushnell again, but the new pair works well, and has a contoured shape that provides a secure, comfortable grip."
5,Busnell Powerview 12x25 Folding Binoculars,Absolutely wonderful. Great value for the price. They are easy to carry and powerful enough for birding and sport events. I love them. I like the fact that each side is adjustable to each eye.I'm having a wonderful time with them.
1,Avoid,"Out of alignment right out of the box. Badly out of alignment.Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect this to be by any means perfect. At this price, sensible distortion and even some slight misalignment are, I think, perfectly acceptable. I just expected something usable. And usable this is not. Considering that returning it meant half the price paid initially, I just disassembled it out of curiosity. There's no alignment mechanism of any sort, it's just how the plastic parts fit together. Which makes me think the chances of getting a unit as bad as I did are extremely high. I won't even comment about quality control...Bottom line: Bushnell makes some pretty good binoculars, but, clearly, not in this price range. The unit I received is unusable. Suggest you spend your twenty bucks on something else or just give it away for charity rather than take your chances with this item."
2,Not for the birds,"These were a last minute purchase as I was leaving for Australia and didn't have much in the way of extra cash. For less than $20, I was willing to take a chance. The binoculars have a fairly narrow field. The optics are good, not great, and work well under certain light conditions. However, on sunny days, they had a serious problem with glare. This could be mitigated somewhat by holding a hat or hand at the correct angle between the binoculars and the sun, but it was quite annoying. Still, as a last minute, low-price purchase they worked well. However, if I were looking for binoculars to use regularly, or for serious birdwatching, I'd buy something else."
4,Pleasantly surprised by quality,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my 10-year-old nephew, who is a beginning birdwatcher. For the price I'm impressed by the magnification clarity. My husband was quite surprised that they were only $20. These binoculars should serve him well for the next few years.The only feature that could be better is the ""strap"" that is really just a string. I was aware of this from the customer photos and purchased them anyway, since the overall value for the cost outweighed this drawback. But they probably would not be comfortable to wear around one's neck for any length of time, if this is important to you."
5,What a deal,"Ok, what can you expect for $15...not much I think. So I was very surprised when these binoculars were clear and were well constructed. I wanted a small pair to throw in my backpack with magnification in this range and didn't want to spend a lot since I wouldn't use them too much. These fill the bill just fine. And I could focus down to about 10 feet which was more than I expected also. Definitely recommend them."
2,"Cheap price, cheap quality","Within days of receiving this product, the rubber around the eye piece fell off. Not a big deal, but annoying nonetheless. The quality of the optics of the binoculars leaves much to be desired, but of course, that is a function of the price. In humid and wet conditions the binoculars just did not hold up. The lenses were always fogged and then a permanent cloud settled in the lenses, making them almost useless. I just left them somewhere when I was traveling. On the plus side, they are small, light and convenient to carry around. Would not buy again, even though they are inexpensive, it just isn't worth the $20-30 that I spent on it. If casual birding in your backyard is all you will be doing with these, this is the product for you. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,Good product,"Pros:+Light, compact (about the size and weight of a modern personal digital camera). Very suitable for theaters. I once sat at the very last row, upstairs of a Broadway theater and could still see the actors pretty well. But don't expect to see the whole show through this, certainly not as comfortable as using your naked eyes.Kind of small for birds view.+Very reasonable price. Package comes with a cleaning cloth, a small bag and a strap.Cons: can be shaky (since it's a 12x) if hands are not strong. If you're not sure, buy 10x instead."
2,Compact and functional but difficult to use,I really think that this would be a good product from the reviews but it isn't for me. The eye relief is too short causing fogging on the eyepiece lens in cooler temps. For the life of me I can't get a consistent diopter setting at the image looks foggy. I have some bushnell 10X25 explorers that are much better if a little bigger. It may be worth it to see if you like 'em since they are so inexpensive.
4,Good product for price,"Actually I was pleasantly suprised by the quality of the product.I had very low expectations for $20 dollar binocular.Only problem I have with this is 12x magnification. I should have bought 10x... or 8x. I don't have shaky hands but everything that you look at, shake so much it hurts my eyes after using more than 5 minutes at a time."
5,Another great Bushnell purchase,"What's not to like? Light, compact and comes with the strap, case and wipe cloth. They are perfect. Keep in mind 12 power can be more challeging to hold still."
4,Great binoculars but beware hand/arm shake,"Attention theater- and concertgoers: After carefully reading the reviews of these Bushnell 12x25 compact binoculars and the Bushnell 8x21s (see my review under that heading), I couldn't decide which would be better for a recent trip to New York, so ended up buying both. My wife and I tried both pairs and agreed that we preferred the lower magnification pair. These, like the 8x21s, are superb quality for the price and truly enhance one's enjoyment of concerts or plays from the nosebleed section. They're easy to focus and the carrying case is handy. The only caveat is that without a tripod or something else to lean on, it's hard to hold them steady for any length of time. For that reason alone, we'd recommend the 8x21s. But birders might of course prefer the higher magnification. An excellent and cheap pair of compact binoculars."
2,Poor manufacturing quality,Quality control on this product is lacking. As I opened the package the cover for the view adjuster came off.
3,Picture Issues,"I ordered these binoculars to replace a pair that I had for years. I wasn't exactly sure of the power of the originals, but they were close. The binoculars I received from Amazon were indeed Bushnell Powerview... but they don't look anything like the picture you see. I guess Bushnell changed the style and kept the name... and Amazon kept the picture. I won't send them back, because these certainly functional. But I REALLY wanted what was in the picture!"
2,Not what I was looking for.,"For $20, I was not going to get a great binocs. This one came even below that expectation. It is very difficult to focus on any object with this."
4,"Does the job it says, but I overbought.. Sometimes, less is more","Bought the 12X version so that we could look at the lava build new land in Hawaii at night from the balcony of our cruise ship. The problems that I had were strictly my own... Small binoculars like these require precise alignment with the eye in order to get the image centered. Larger ones are easier for me to line up with my glasses (or without). Buying 12X made the problem worse. I should have stopped at 10X. And given an option I would have liked a larger than 25mm objective lens.The case is nice and holds the binoculars snugly. Never tried the belt loops. The size is great and fits nicely in a cargo pants pocket. When a larger model is not convenient, these work well.Using them for a long time is tiring. But for quick spotting, these are fine."
1,Broke after 2 uses and exit pupil too narrow,"I've only used these twice and the 2nd time was star gazing and the focusing mechanism in the left lens stopped working without an apparent cause of damage. The small exit pupil diamater has always resulted in serious eye strain as well, making perfect alignment a requirement for getting any usable images.You get what you pay for."
1,inferior quality,"With the Bushnell name I just assumed I would get a quality product, that at minimum the ""picture"" would be clear, easy to adjust. Frankly, these binoculars are about equal to something plastic you can buy in a five-and-dime store or a Hong-Kong knockoff. I should have returned them, but wife and I went on a cruise, tried to use them, put them away and forgot about them. I buy often on Amazon, but this purchase was cheap crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Little Binoculars,"I purchased this hoping to get a compact, easily ""pocketable"" yet useful binocular, and I am more than satisfied with the Bushnell Powerview 12x25. These are impressive. I use them for baseball games (Go Dodgers), the power for their size is great."
1,Unusable,"Everything with these binoculars is up to par except for one crucial thing. Both focusing mechanisms work fine, the overall quality seems to be fine, but the images from each lens are misaligned. This leads to a double image, not matter how you hold them. Unfortunately this makes them unusable, and I will have to send them in for warranty.Disappointing..."
1,Two lenses will not focus into one picture,"Bought these as Christmas gift for my spouse, and right after Christmas we took a motorhome trip, not testing them until we were on the road. We both did everything possible to get the left and right sides to come together as one picture but to our great disappointment nothing helped. Although rated highly on Amazon by other customers, this was a defective pair of binoculars. Problem now is that we were on the road for over 30 days and now it's too late to return them for a full refund."
2,SO DISAPPOINTED IN THESE.,"COULD NOT WAIT TO GET THESE FOR BIRD WATCHING IN MY YARD. READ ALL THE REVIEWS, THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE GRAND. TOO HARD TO FOCUS, THE BIRD IS GONE BY THAT TIME. SPORTING EVENTS, CONCERTS MAY BE OK. DISTANCE CHANGES WHEN WATCHING BIRDS. I DID FINALLY SEE A CARDINAL IN A TREE UP CLOSE. WISH I COULD FIND BINOCS THAT WORK FOR BIRD AND BUTTERFLY WATCHING IN THE YARD AND IN THE TREES, OR COULD FIQURE OUT HOW TO OPERATE THESE. THEY ARE GREAT ONCE I GET THEM FOCUSED THOUGH."
4,great buy,These binocs are a great buy for the money. I would recommend them to anyone. super performance for such a small package. dart
3,I can't focus it well.,"However I tried and followed the direction, I get a blurred image and it tires my eyes out. If I close one eye and look, the image is good, but when look with both eyes, the image is very blurred and it hurts my eyes. I can't really use it for anything. I don't know why."
4,Bad then Good,"When my binoc arrived, the optics were terrible. Vertical disintegration, no way to correct. Returned and exchanged and this pair is perfect. 12x is fine for my hands and the view is great. I miss my Minoltas (does anyone know where they went?), but these will do and the price is more than right."
4,Good buy for the money.,"If you're not rich, and can't afford $1000 binos, this is a good option for you. They're rubber armored and seem to be made pretty well. Granted, you don't get the clarity that you would with more expensive binos, but for day-to-day use, they'll do very well. They fold up compact, and fit into a nice nylon case. The only thing lacking, I thought, was a set of caps for the lenses, which are not included. That would come in handy if you carried them around your neck, instead of keeping them in the case. Oh well, what do you expect for this price?All in all, these binos work just fine. They focus well, and you can see what you're looking at pretty clear. I think they're rugged enough to be dropped and still function. Bushnell generally makes a pretty decent product.If you're wanting perfection, then buy $1000 binos. But if you're on a budget, these will work just fine for you."
4,Good value,Bought to replace another a similar pair that my grandson dropped and misaligned the optics. I gave him the old pair.For the price these are very good for what I want them for. I am very happy with them.
4,I can almost see clearly now . . .,"I'm trying to get used to the binoculars, but I think they'll work out fine - especially for the price."
4,Good value for the money,I use it for theater and sports. It does a good job. Good optics. The build is somewhat rusty and cheep. The neck strip is way too thin. The focusing ring provides for a reasonable distance range. Overall - very good value for the money. I've seen better optics and better build however at a much higher price. For the casual user or the casual use I strongly recommend it.
2,Bushnell Binoculars,I have used this prodduct twice and it has already started to fall apart. There is a piece underneath the roller to focus the binoculars that has come unglued.
2,Unusable,"I wear eyeglasses. The ""eyecups fold down for eyeglass users"" claim was proven wrong on two separate pairs. The rubber was too hard, and the fold-over too shallow... they wouldn't stay folded for more than a second or two before snapping back. Even tried strapping them down overnight with rubber bands to loosen the rubber's memory, to no avail. Plus, narrow field of view and excessive magnification combined with inexpensive optics equalled poor viewing experience. Exchanged for the 8x21's. A slightly different design, the eyecups have enough depth to fold over properly, the viewing is better, and they're even more compact."
4,very good binoculars,"I bought these for a concert I recently attended. Our seats were all the way at the back of the arena but these binoculars made it seem like I was on the floor. Not quite first row, but much, much better than where we were seated. They are clear and crisp and I highly recommend them."
3,"Good, but could be better","My 9 year old and I read this and it was definitely an interesting read. However, you should know that the pages are quite small and the print a little large, so the actual amount of reading is probably less than 50 standard pages. Also, in order to read all of the Odyssey, you need to purchase at least 4 of these small books, which gets pretty expensive. Additionally, I believe this story for children lends itself to illustrations of which this book has virtually none. We decided to go with http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1841488003/ref=ord_cart_shr?_encoding=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&v=glance book as it had all of the Odyssey stories in a single book with beautiful illustrations."
2,Split after two months of use,"I purchased this product in December of 2010, because my old axe handle was splitting at the neck and was due for replacement - we got it back in the 1980s! Well I had high hopes for this new one, after all it said ""Genuine Hickory Made in USA"" on it. Sadly, after barely two months of use (splitting pine logs for firewood at home), the new Seymour handle was already splitting, and by February 3 2011, it was totally useless - was split both in the front and back with 8-inch pieces broken off. Unfortunately I discarded (burned actually) the old handle, should have saved it and filed down the neck to re-use it. Now I have to find a replacement, the local Ace Hardware only stocks this brand, and the ones at Home Depot look even worse - very cheap-looking with rough finish, uncomfortable to grip. Perhaps I can find a good used older one on the internet..."
3,Wedding Day Dancing gets the job done.,"We had one month before our wedding to teach my husband how to dance. This DVD showed clear steps for the male and female parts. The actual quality of the DVD is not very professional. The images look like they were filmed with a home video camera, and sometimes the background music is louder than the instructor's voice. The included wedding song list insert is photocopied instead of professionally printed.But despite these flaws, we learned enough to have a successful first dance, and gave my husband the confidence to know that even he, who marches to the beat of a different drummer, can learn how to dance with guidance from Wedding Day Dancing."
3,It was an OK book,"For me, if a book is really great, I would finish it in a day. This book took me almost 2 weeks to read just because I forgot that I had the book at times. I wasn't excited to finish.I felt it took too long to get to the good part and when it did, it was over too soon.What I did love about the book was revisiting the Madarises and their friends. This family is so cute and spunky."
5,wonderful,"Benda Jackson has done it again, this book was amazing and well worth the wait. I hated for it to end, and will be thinking about these characters for a long time. Family, love, drama, romance and a thriller all rolled into one."
3,It Was Okay,"This book was pretty good. Sometimes I felt the author went on and on about things she had already stressed, but I enjoyed all the scenes between Alex, and Christy."
5,Hot,"THe chemistry bettween the characters was great,the characters were also clear and easy to visualize and relate to.It had a good amount of suspence and drama not to mention the steamy love sences.THis was an easy quick enjoyable read."
3,So not what I thought,"If you are expecting your typical Brenda Jackson romance book, this is not the book for you. This is more of a mystery book for certain. I really didnt feel a heated chemistry between Cristy and Alex that I thought I would feel. After I read Surrender All I just knew this story would be great.....I love Brenda Jackson and will continue to read her works....this one just wasnt for me."
1,The 1972 edition: Hobnailed (and later re-done - well!),"Savacou Publications (1972)ASIN: B0006CVXH6That edition was so ridden with error that the publisher, Savacou Publications Ltd., removed it from circulation because it was not able ""to stand as representative of the author's intentions"" and produced the 1975 edition in its stead, correctly, with apology to Mr. McNeill.See: the excellent, corrected, 1975 edition, if you will."
1,The picture was not what I received,The product was said to be a pre-filled floater and it was not. It wasn't anything like the description. I tried to contact amazon and they sent me out another of the same product. I am not satisfied at all with this product.
2,misunderstood,I was under the impression that chlorine came in the floater. Don't make the same mistake I did. You need to order the tablets seperate.
1,**** THIS IS NOT PRE-FILLLED WITH CHLORINE! ***,"The discription says..""The HTH Pace Disposable Floater is pre-filled with 1? trichloro-s-triazinetrione (trichlor) tablets."" Well it is NOT! They sent this to me and it did not include the chlorine. What was sent was just the container. Nothing else."
4,brilliance uncut,"This is torn at his kaleidoscopic, incindiary best. More ideas in a single track than you'll hear on most albums. ""Prezens"" bursts with infectious grooves, exotic flavas and exuberant energy. More than anything, though, there is a kind of genre-bending humour here, if Fatboy could play the guitar like Hendrix, it would sound something like this. Best of all this feels like a band album, and when the four guys rock, THEY ROCK."
3,Interesting does not mean beatiful,"I expected a little more. There is a technological revolution behind guitars. Most evident is the possibility of looping and create loops over loops. I expected from Torn and ECM something more creative than ""old time free jazz"". What surprize me the most is the absence of any idea about rythm."
3,"So So, 4000 devided by 2","I am not very outgoing, so I thought this book would help me start some conversations with people I don't know. Yes, there are some questions I never would have thought to ask, an some questions I had fun answering my self. However, there are so many duplicates! Just the same question rewritten 5 different ways! Not to mention, most of the questions were a little too personal to be asking someone you don't know. It is a great book to sit down with your mate on a rainy or snowy winter night,and each read a few questions. If for nothing else, you may learn a few new things about yourself!"
3,"4,000 Questions for Getting to Know Anyone and Everyone","I bought this book as a sort of game for my fiance' and I. I figured with 4000 questions, how could it be anything but dull?I was disappointed as I flipped through the book, to see that we had already asked each other most of these questions. I was looking for interesting, conversation sparking questions--and these were your streotypical ""just getting to know you"" questions. We resorted to making up our own questions.If you want a general book with general questions, this is for you. If you're looking for a more in depth, personal book with exciting questions--this is NOT it."
5,Mind-opening in small doses,"I've had a lot of success using this book in advanced ESL classes, whether for writing or conversation topics.I've also enjoyed using it with my wife, we take turns picking questions for each other to answer. (We've also added a lot of our own.)Some people might feel overwhelmed if they take the approach of trying to think about or ask someone all or even most of the questions in order.This is a book to be brought out occasionally and savored little by little. It's added more perspective and fun to our lives than any book we've read in a long time."
4,So Many Questions... So Little Time,"This book is great for getting to know someone our just to start a conversation. My boyfriend is across the country for med school, and this book has really helped our long distance relationship."
1,SimpleTech Customer Service,"This company has the worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with. I tried to buy a portable hard drive and their system pulled two authorizations on this one buy on my American express card for $232 each and I have been trying for days to get somebody to cancel the credit authorizations so that I could make a purchase from them. Their customer service lines do not work, they have nobody on line to talk to and they have a phone system that requires you to leave a message and nobody follows up.DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE IF YOU EXPECT ANY KIND OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT OR SERVICE."
5,It doesnt get any better than this!,This book is huge! Anyone who loves these E-types will love this book.From concept to the series 111 this book covers the lot and in great detail.Beautiful b&w and colour photos and an amazing story and in so many glossy pages make this the ultimate book on these Jaguars.If you want to buy a real gift for the E-type lover this book is it.They'll love you for it.
1,Crappy Customer Service by both the Amazon and provider!!!!,"This book is a beautiful book; however Amazon.com shipped a damaged used copy not once, but twice! When I inquired on how to fix this issue I was told, ""ordering another book is not an option"". Because they sent the issue to the investigation area I could not have another replacement book shipped. Really? I would think they would have found an undamaged book and sent it to me free of charge. NO MORE AMAZON.COM for me. Louise LaneBoth books had scratched covers, dog ears, ruffled through pages, and broken bindings. For a special book, this is NOT exceptable. It is like buying a new car with a scratch down the hood. You would not accept it, nor would the dealer accept it from the distribution."
5,Got a drooping headliner?,"These little guys are perfect for fixing that flapping PITA headliner in your car. Sure, you could spend a lot of time and money fixing it the right way, but if you're driving a semi-clunker, these do the job. I just twisted them into the padding in a quilted pattern, about 3"" apart. It took two packages to do my 4-door Chevy Corsica. They have been in there for two years now, and it's all as good as the day I put them there."
2,Pin heads break away from pin shaft,"I attempted to use these pins to hold arm covers for a sofa. when you screw them in, almost every pin head loosened away from the pin shaft so that the head would spin freely from the curly shaft. This made it impossible to screw in further, or remove for that matter. 80% of the pins in my package broke. It is possible that my batch was constructed improperly but looking at the pin head design, I cannot see how they expect the plastic to stick to the metal shaft. Any torque will break the item. My sofa was cloth an not very difficult to pierce so I cannot see this working any better for other purposes either."
3,Pain to use,"Bought these pins to attach my couch cover to the couch, after months of having the cover slip all the time. I had to essentially flip the couch over to tack the cover onto the wooden bases--I would be sure to tack the cover only on a solid hard surface (like wood) of the couch, or else your couch might get damaged, and the cover.Putting these tacks in is not as easy as it looks--it's quite difficult to twist the pins and secure them into the couch, and to add to that frustration, sometimes the metal tack part of the pin would bend and break, making it that much more difficult to use. Also, once or twice while putting them into my couch, the actual metal tack part would dislodge itself from the plastic base. After that its impossible to use.But I'm giving this product 3 stars because after I FINALLY got them all in and secure, they secured my cover to the couch quite well. The tacks have yet to come out of the couch, leaving my cover on quite nicely."
2,Didn't work as I thought,I had purchased it to help hold down a rug on a carpet. Unfortunately the pin broke from the plastic and it did not work.
3,Lover's Ramblings and Humor,This play is best seen. It gets very confusing with the 4 lovers talking over one another and others doing the same. A very imaginative play that is unlike any dream I have ever had. I would recommend it to those looking for humor.
3,pretty good,I had to read this book in My C.P. English 10class and when I went to the bookstore to pick it up I thought that this one might help me understand Shakespeare's writing a lot more.It helps that on the opposite pages of the text it gives you definitions. I did end up having to do a lot of translating myself to understand and actually remember what was going on
5,A Midsummer Night's Read,"Take an enchanted forest in Athens, Greece. Add six actors and two quarrelsome couples. The end result is William Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream."" Mischievious fairies, magical potions, and tragic comedies all come into the mix creating a play that will have you thinking in verse for months. If you are desperately looking for a book that actually won't put you to slep, this book may be the cure you were looking for. This is a book you will never forget."
4,Long Way Down,"This film portrays in great detail the meager existence of advanced drug abusers just before jail, overdose, or rehab. I would imagine you could find an identical clone of any one of these characters on any random day in a 72 hour detox. It also does a better job than similar films of shining a spotlight on just how much time and energy is expended on their desperate con games for getting some kind of fix."
4,Stunningly Haunting,Perhaps I'm partial to this movie since I live in Jacksonville and know a lot of the area shown in the movie. I was moved by the story. Stunningly Haunting.
5,Made me cry,"My first review has disappeared... what happened to it?This was a stunning film. I am just speechless.I will wait and hope the first one shows up. In the meantime, read more about Damian K. Lahey, who wrote, acted in the lead role and co-directed this phenomenal film, at IndieSlate dot com, ""Sophmore Blues.""[...]"
2,I want my 90 minutes back,"Oy, this one is a downer. The lead does a great job, but it's just a wandering drug flick."
3,Another perspective & point of view,"D Childress reveals many little gems in this book; such as mentioning the infamous Sir Francis Drake was the cousin of notorious slaver John Hawkins. I was not aware of this. He also states the famous Templar family monarchy ""Sinclair"" was actually ""St. Clair"" the 7th president under the continental congress was General Arthur St. Clair (the hereditary heir of the Knights Templar)and later governor of the Northwest territory of the U.S.A. He also adds to the intrigue between the Knights Templar & the Assasins. If you like books on nautical topics, you might find this book interesting. But at times I think he gets a bit obsessed with his Masonic ""Motifs"". Whether they be true or false.I know there were pirates of all nationalties and races, but doesn't corsair mean just that coarse hair? Many of the pirates he mentioned must of been swarthy at least. Overall, pretty entertaining and a quick read but I find his lost city series a bit more informative."
5,Ear Plugs from Heaven,"I have been using Flents Ear Stopples for decades and, in my opinion, they're the best in the world. I cut each of the wax-cotton plugs in half, which gives me a comfortable, airtight fit in each ear. Thus, a single box of Flents Ear Stopples provides close to a year's supply of comfort. Each wax-cotton ear plug lasts about a month before it's time to replace it. That makes 12 pairs for continual use and reuse.I've gone just about everywhere and done just about everything one can imagine wearing Flents Ear Stopples; no other ear plug product can compare. Where other ear plugs either hurt your ears or break apart when you try to take them out, Flents Ear Stopples are comfy, durable, economical, easy to get in and out, and brilliant at keeping external sounds down to a dull roar. What's not to love? Flents Ear Stopples are THE ONE AND ONLY EAR PLUGS for me."
2,Product quality down the tubes (and I don't mean eustachean),"I've been using these earplugs for many years. They've enabled me to sleep soundly by totally blocking out most noise, and I take them to rock concerts to lower my personal decibels. These WERE the best on the market. However, this last batch had less wax, which mostly wasn't enough to bind well to the cotton, so they didn't mold very well or stay in my ear. The center of the earplug seemed to be just stiff cotton... not exactly the most comfortable for sleeping. Several in each of the two packages I ordered were absolute duds due to having too little wax. In the past, I could break each earplug in half and use half in each ear, and they molded well to the ear. I might get one or two duds per package, but this last order was awful. I see that other recent reviewers have noticed this, also. In sum: the product's not very good anymore -- too little wax. FIX IT!!"
4,"Flents, return to your original formula!","I have depended on ear stopples for more than a decade. This wax+cotton ear plug facilitates sleep better than any foam plug.In years past, the stopples were larger and had more wax. They molded easily and stayed in my ears all night.Now, I'd say 1/3 of every box qualifies as duds. They never form properly -- too much cotton, not enough wax. And they become stringy and fall out before morning, so the barking dog next door ends up waking me.I called the company and was told by the receptionist, ""I don't think anyone has changed the formula."" Well, the formula or the production or the shipping or something has changed. I want my original Flents back! When this product is good, there's nothing better."
1,Blocked maybe 25% of sound. Not enough to keep me asleep.,"I bought these as a temporary solution to blocking out nightly coughing from a family member. I'm a very light sleeper, and had to keep my door open to allow the air conditioning to get in. After several nights of no sleep, I bought these hoping they would block out the coughing (from downstairs) and I would be able to fall asleep.Well I was very disappointed in how they worked (or rather, how they DIDN'T work). They do not 'expand in the ear' as the package claims. I followed the instructions to the letter, but even then they only blocked maybe 25% of the sound. I could still hear everything, it was simply muffled. I expect earplugs to BLOCK sound, not just muffle it. I wonder if I got a bad batch, as other people are suggesting? Either way, I won't be buying these again. Putting a pillow against my ear blocked more sound than these worthless things."
2,Definate Decline in Quality!,"Some years back, I wrote a glowing review about having used Flents for over 45 years. Unfortunately, since the original manufacturer (Flents) sold out to another company, there has been a drastic and disappointing drop in quality because of the poor manufacturing, not incorporating the necessary amount of wax in the mixture with the cotton. This results in an ear plug which is very difficult to mold, cannot easily conform to the ear canal, thus not preventing the external sound or noise. I wasn't aware until recently that Flents had been sold to another company, and they're letting an excellent product 'go down the tubes'. Let's hope that another manufacturer picks up on the opportunity to create a similar product to the old-style Flents wax and cotton combination!"
1,Horrible product!,"I couldn't use them at all. So dissapointing - they won't stay in place, they fall out, and they really hurt! Pushinng them inside the ear canal only causes discomfort. And even after they are in, they don't block any noise! Worthless product. What a waste of money."
5,Learn to like cleaning!,"I love this book! It truly delivers on cleaning faster, EASIER, and better. Even if you're a person who hates cleaning, procrastinates cleaning, or someone who loves it, this book offers an organized way to knock out those cleaning chores with minimal effort. This book offers cleaning tips, warnings against causing damage to product, person, or pets. Its ZAP cleaning method will have your home clean in no time. There are plenty of tips if you scan parts of the book or if you read it cover to cover. WARNING: this book may cause you to spend many more hours cleaning than you planned. But the up side is you won't mind, because somehow the book makes it fun. I get the feeling when reading this book the author LOVES to clean. That's not me, but the book makes me mind cleaning a lot less. For some, that's a major milestone. Enjoy the book!"
4,Leather Steering Wheel Cover,"Superskin leather steering wheel cover - went on pretty easy, thread supplied could be better quality (probably why they give you 2 long rolls) - isn't as nice (quality & softness) as wheelskin brand."
4,Leather steering wheel cover. Lace up style,"I bought this for Christmas for my husband. Not all of the wholes to lace this up were punched out very well. Also the wholes were VERY SMALL. After only getting a few laces done in 15 min. He stopped came in and punched out every whole with a larger needle. He still has to put on, says it will still take him an hour to put on. Do not know how it fits yet. (He did want this type). It could have been better made as far as the wholes for lacing being bigger!"
3,Wheel wrap,"In the description of the product it mentions that the leather is black, unfortunelty I didn't find that it was black but more of a grey colour steering wheel cover. I like it don't get me wrong but I would have appreciated it more had it actually been black."
2,Rougher than the picture indicates,"This is nowhere near as supple as the picture on the box would have you believe. In fact, it's about as rough as the stock steering wheel that I wanted to cover up. I'll be returning this product.At least I found out I don't like it before I installed it."
2,Amazon ripoff on shipping,Get yours at pepboys for the same price and don't get screwed by amazon shipping doubling the price
2,Didn't even use it!,"The leather is very nice! To thread and stretch this onto my stealing wheel would have taken all day. Not joking. It took 45 minutes to get as far as I did, about 5 inches, and I gave up and had my husband do it. He unthreaded the whole thing and told me it has an akward section that hangs loose when you thread around stearing wheel components. Went to the store and got a quicker assembly model."
4,Get a Grip,"This leather cover is fine, go ahead and buy! I got it a year ago and looks the same as when I put it on. It's a little work, but all these type are if you have done it before. Good price and good grip!"
2,"Don't bother with it, it looks cheap","So I bought and tried this and was terribly disappointed. The leather looks really cheap. The install was cumbersome but not 4 hours like some claimed...but it does take a good 1.5h maybe 2 if you are slow. I also didn't find the needles to be low quality, or the holes to be too small. That part was fine, it's the quality of the leather and the thread that looks cheap. The stitching just looks incredibly cheap as well. If you have a nice car, and want to give it a even nicer look, this is not for you."
4,Good for the price,"The quality is good but not great - for the price I think it is a good value. It does require careful preparation so that it can be a lot less frustrating - if you can, try to take breaks because it is not easy to handle the needles, steering wheel position and limited space. Overall I am happy with the result."
3,Steering Wheel Cover,"The quality of the leather was just fine,however the needles provided to stitch it on the steering wheel were inadequate. They were small straight needles and the job really requires a curved needle of the type used for upholstery work. My wife had one in here sewing kit that worked just fine. It is labor intensive to put it on."
1,"Amazon Description Incorrect, Not complete","This item (58-0600) is NOT the Extra Wide Superskin as shown in the description, but is the medium size ""B"". No where in the description is the size noted. The extra wide is item 58-0700 but I had to find that out after doing some heavy on-line research. Amazon online and telephone support does not give this information and, in fact, the telephone support kept telling me that I was wrong. The product is great - if you can get the correct size."
5,Good look and long lasting,"I found this to be an excellent product. I installed this on my 1989 Cherokee when new (18 years ago). I used the cross stitch which requires two needles. It took some time but went on perfectly and looked like it was factory installed. It just takes some patience and care. Be sure to gently pull the edges tight together. It helps to brings the edges together by ""working"" the leather together with your fingers before stitching. The real story is that it lasted until this year and lasted better than the paint job on the car! Eighteen years for $15 is pretty good."
2,What a pain,"i thought this would look cool, but to be honest, the instructions are complex, it bubbles all over the place, and looks cheap. I will admit the installation is probably my fault, but i tried it three times... For what it is, it sort of works, but i expect it to fall apart quickly, as it already seems to be doing. Next time i will hit up walmart for a tazmanian devil."
4,Good finished product; tedious installation,"I installed this about 28 months ago and have been pleased with the finished product.Some perforations were missing, some double and others only partial making it more difficult and time consuming; the needle provided MIGHT be adequate if it were not stressed by the inadequate perforations. I had one needle break shredding the lace so I had to start over loosing about an hour; I got a better needle and luckily I had another lace. I have some experience with upholstery and found that very helpful and would expect this to be a challenge for a novice. I have docked it one star for the poor perforations and needle quality which made the installation time significantly longer; in retrospect I would check/correct the perforations before starting the installation as it would be much easier to complete the perforations off of the steering wheel and reduce the potential for misalignment."
4,"Looks Great, But....","This is a high-quality product that looks great now that its installed. Installation is a real challenge requiring great patience and determination. No fault of the product - this is just a hard thing to do well. I would recommend this for an auto enthusiast who likes to spend time on their car. Installation required between 4 and 5 hours over two days. (I would not recommend trying to do it in one.) The steering wheel spokes on my Alfa Romeo are wide and flat, so the cover bulged over the spokes. I remedied this with a little contact cement. The end result is that it looks and feels great. It was worth the effort for me."
1,What a waste..,"It was a pain to get this thing on just to realize it looks ugly. Save yourself some time and money, don't buy this and look for a different type or get one installed professionally. I purchased a different one that was easy to install and looks good."
4,Yet to find out,"Product delivered on time and in good condition. Needle provided with product is too weak broke easily, I recommend the purchaser to buy a professional-style needle. I yet to install the product, it seems like I need a whole day off to install this cover properly. Things to look forward to I guess"
1,"If I could give it no stars, I would","This product was deceiving, it didn't mention the fact that you have to sew the cover onto the wheel. If I knew that I wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. It was way too time consuming, you could buy a cover that already comes sewn for the price of this. I wound up throwing the cover out."
4,Take your time to put it on and it would look great!!!!,This product was shipped and processed fast. The quality is good not great. It took me about 2 hours to put it on my steering wheel. You need to be patient with stitching and take your time. It looks great on my truck. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I expected better skin quality and shorter time to put it on. I would still recommend it to everyone.
1,Not what was advertised!!!,"this product was a very nice comfortable leather, however when the package was first open, one of the seams had a hole about one inch long in it. combined with this, amazon had advertised that it would fir my vehicle, this however was not the case!!! the length around the steering wheel was perfect, but the width around the grip of the steering wheel was way too small. It did not fit my vehicle even close, and this was very disappointing! please make sure that you call to place this order to double check that it will in fact fit your car/truck ahead of time!"
1,Poorly made,Holes for laceing the wheel cover own were not punched through the niddle would not go through.one was to big for steering wheel. There were no options for sizes of wheel cover own the ads. Once I got the wheel cover there were diffrent sizes showen on the box. So I have two steering wheel covers I can't use.
1,Extremely Difficult to Install,"I was excited by how nice the leather felt, but as soon as I tried to put the cover on, I quickly discovered that the installation was EXTREMELY DIFFICULT! So if you have a ton of patients, about 3 hours, and like callouses on your fingers, then this stirring wheel cover is for you. There are several specific issues with it. 1.The pre-made holes in the leather are far too small, so it is very hard for the needle to fit through. 2. The thread is far too long, which makes tangling and knotting an ongoing problem. 3. Because of the latter, it is also hard to tighten the thread after every stitch. Honestly, I have struggled with it for about 50 minutes and am only about a quarter of the way done. I'm sure it will look nice when it is actually all the way on my steering wheel. Once again, the leather is very nice quality, but I would not recommend this product, because trying to put it on is ridiculously challenging!"
2,Unsuccessful on Jetta,"I attempted to use this product on a new-style Jetta. I was unsuccessful. I installed this item in three different ways, three different times, without satisfactory results. The entire cover has the same circumference, including the edges, so there was a lot of bunching and gathering. This may be due in part to the large spoke areas of the Jetta wheels. It may be due in part to the type of material used to manufacture this cover. Other styles that I have used left me with a close-to-professional look. This one was a horrendous mess. Your mileage may vary."
2,Unsuccessful on Toyota Yaris,"Because the pattern is the same width throughout, there is significant bunching of the leather around the spokes. In addition, the diameter of the cover is a little too large for the Yaris' steering wheel, so there is a 4 inch or so area of bunching at the bottom of the wheel at my start/end point. I used the cross stich pattern, which is more time intensive and took about 3.5 hours of steady hard work with a thimble to assist me. The end result looks quite poor. I have successfully used this product on an older car with a thin steering wheel that was uniform in thickness around the entire wheel. I would not buy this again for a modern car."
3,Good but I was looking for a different Douglas Adams,"The book makes some humorous observations illuminating paradoxes in the bible. While its entertaining, I had originally thought it was written by the Douglas Adams who wrote the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but it is not."
4,Warning,"This was a great book. I picked this up thinking this was the ""hitchhikers guide"" Douglas Adams. I really enjoyed this book but I think it should be stated this is NOT the 42 guy. So if you're looking for his books, this is not one of them."
2,Catchy Title - Slow Reading,"Have you ever seen a movie preview that was hilariously funny and promised lots of potential for developing that humor, only to find that all the best scenes were included in the preview? That's somewhat the feeling I had after finishing reading this book. Now, I would not go so far as to liken the book to Vogon poetry, but it could have done more with its topic and title!The book does have some interesting insights into the raw edges in Biblical stories. For clergy who are looking for innovative ways to bring the scriptures to life, this could be a very good resource. For individual study and/or entertainment, don't bother.Particularly disconcerting was the way in which the book simply ends - without any particular ending. It was almost as if Adams just ran out of ideas - or time - or pages committed by his publisher...Too bad: the title really did sound promising..."
3,Not by the same author as the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Series!,"For people who are fans of Douglas N. Adams the author of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, I would like to warn you that the author of The Prostitue in the Family Tree: Discovering Humor and Irony in the Bible is a different person named Douglas E. Adams. Unlike the famious radical British athiest Douglas N. Adams, E. Adams is an American preacher who is not in any respects a comedian. I hope you do not make the mistake that I made."
3,Disappointed,"While there were many old hymns done up in the fabulous Gaither Homecoming Friends style, it seemed to me as if this DVD kinda dragged on and on. It needed more upbeat stuff between the sssssllllloooooowwwwwww selections."
3,Review of Bill Gaither music DVD,"Sorry, I am unable to review. The DVD was purchased as a Mother's Day gift which isn't until next Sunday, May 11. The DVD hasn't been played yet."
5,INSPIRING,Found the songs so inspirational. Some of the greatest hymns presented with class and feeling. We really enjoy listening to this DVD.
1,Disappointed,"I found this book to be insulting to women as a whole. It talked down to the reader and assumed that because you were reading it you were automatically a spoiled, whimpering brat. This book will not disgrace my library shelves."
1,Condensed version of another book by same author,"Don't bother with this book...It is a condensed version of the Unix made easy (3rd edition) book by the same author...The author basically took out some programming in shell chapters and used the rest of the Unix made easy book verbatim...Save your money as this ""newer"" book is twice as expensive as the Unix made easy (3rd edition) and has less information...If you want a book that gives a good solid introduction to Unix and Linux use the author's other book, which I would give 4 stars."
5,High impact for your teaching,"I have this book on my desk again, reviewing key points as I prep for the first week of school, which starts tomorrow. This book, I believe, has contributed to my students' motivation, learning, and teamwork more than any other I've come across in 20 years of teaching and a PhD in Education...and I am still learning and applying more of the concepts contained here. Buy it. Use it."
4,Common sense advice wrapped in cheese,"This book has some good teaching tips and advice. It offers a prepackaged teaching philosophy that favors multiple sensory methods. If you want a more comprehensive list of ideals to shop from when defining your philosophy of education then I would look to other books. Be forewarned that this book is crammed full of cheesy inspirational dingle-whop-its that can get to be really annoying. Also, if you're into math or physics you're going to abhor the abuse of the word/idea of quantum. Be prepared to weep bitterly when you read her explanation that it is a near perfect synonym for synergy."
3,Good product but slow in shipping,"Overall, the product was o.k. I thought I've purchased a new battery but was a used one. Also, it took a month to get to my place."
3,low quality expected more.,the housings are barely put together and the cut off line for the beam of light is very distorted. not too happy with this product.
5,Excellent service and quality,"I cannot give a seller feedback yet as that is the msg I am receiving from the Amazon feedback page, however, the Star is awesome quality for the price. I would order from Silver Insanity again in a New York minute!"
3,Alright,"Kinda small, no chain included.great shine and material. Its a little sharp so becareful.Its a good buy."
2,Very Poor Quality!!!,"We used this tow rope 4 times while on vacation to pull a tube with 3 small children (total weight on the tube of less than 150 lbs) and after the first use I noticed several places along the rope that were starting to fray. After the 4th day of use (about 1.5-2 hours per day) 2 complete groups of rope fibers out of the 16 groups were completely broken. This rope is supposed to be weight rated up to 6000 lbs. There is NO WAY it would hold up to a heavier load! I would recommend spending a little more and trying a different brand rope. Also, don't buy things from BoatersWorld.com very hard company to deal with!"
4,Great Planer for the Price,"I've had this planer for over a year and have to say for the price and space it was well worth it. I've planed well over 100 pieces of various hardwoods and have been pleased with the overall performance. I initially had some problems with tearout on the ends of hardwoods I'd planed and later learned that simply raising the workpiece slightly as it exits the planer will prevent tearout and it worked. (Yes, I'm relatively new to the fine woodworking arena). The accuracy and flatness of the cuts have meet all of my needs from jigs to basic furniture."
4,Great planer - but may have been sent used,"In the past I have been able to use some very nice industrial planers. Now that I have my own (small) shop, this is what I can afford & fit in my space. So far the reviews I read are true, great planer with results as good as the industrial planers I have used in the past.Now my issue - Before plugging the planer in for the first time, I opened up the blade access door and found wood shavings inside. I'm worried that I was sent a used item."
5,"4 Years running, one small issue has crept in.","I've been very happy using this planer for the last 4 years but the last time I pulled it out it did something it had never done before. The boards were jerking along, actually stopping and starting. My first thought was the rollers slipping but looking with a flashlight, the rollers were actually stopping. To make a long story short, the grease on the drive chain under the left cover had stiffened up from the cold (and age?) that it was pushing itself over the roller sprocket. Very simple fix, pull the drive chain off, into a can of degreaser, once clean and dry, install and oil. Back to cutting perfect."
5,Good quality and GREAT product!,We did a whole kitchen with one of these and we loved it!!!!! A+A+A+A+A+A+ and only wish we'd have bought the bigger one. But this one did fine for home improvement stuff!!!
3,"5 STARS FOR THE PLANER , 0 STARS FOR MAKITA","I recently purchased the 2012nb and could not be more pleased with the performance.The problem I am having is the mess when I use it. After a two week hunt for the dust hood I am told that Makita has it back ordered with no idea when it will be available. Shame on you Makita. For the lousy $20.00 your charging and the 50 cents it cost you to make, it should have been included with the heavy price of the unit. For anyone else who is having the same problem I found that a $4.00 fitting for a hot air heating duct works perfect."
2,disapointed,"I have same problem as previous post ,drive stops and starts .have owned it a few years .gets moderate use .problem was there from the start ,minor at 1st and today it is driving me nuts .I need it now and my recent exp with makita parts was months coming . sure got good reviews .the depth adjustment stays put which is good ,no gimckie anti snipe handle . wish it worked today"
5,Fantastic,I own the older model I have had it for about 20 years and never had a minutes of trouble . I have used 4 sets of blades and I plane mostly oak. Changing blades is a snap. About 15 mins and it is ready to go to work for you. I would recomend this machine anytime
5,A Great Machine,"I've had the Makita 2012NB planer for about 9 mo.s now. I've run hundreds of board feet through it, everything from red cedar to teak. It has performed wonderfully on all I've run at it. Adjustments are simple and accurate, and it's stable as a rock. One of the best tools I own."
3,Meh,The book was shipped quickly and arrived within the timeframe stated on the purchase order. However the book referred to as used-acceptable was heavily water damaged and should have been labeled as used-poor.
1,Not satisfied,"I ordered this book in paper back, 8th edition and received a hard book, 3rd edition. Though I received my money back, I do not have the book I need for my class which started a month ago."
1,Not As Advertised - No Stars,The product was advertised to hold a 20 lb. turkey. This is not true. The product would not even hold an 18 lb. Honeysuckle turkey.I purchased this product solely because of this representation and thus I am totally dissatisfied.
1,stiffed,"was stiffed by seller, ordered unit, it took them a week to tell me that they were not going to ship it and no reason given. I really needed that power supply."
5,Very cute baby harp seal doll,"Bought this gift for my little sister, she hugs it to bed every night. After one month it's still in good condition. Very smooth fur and an adorable expression on the face."
4,Very nice !!!,"After some of the reviews I was sceptical about purchasing this, but I thought for the price, I would take a chance. and Im glad I did. This is a wonderful set. The top is rough, but that is just the nature of the fabric. If anyone has had an expensive comforter set knows it will soften with use, and really you dont lay on the comforter anyways :-) The colors are very rich looking and match my taupe walls and frieze cream colored carpet wonderfully. An awesome deal and I LOVE it !!!"
2,Must have discovered these in an old warehouse. (designs from the 1970's ) ???,"1. Great for use in your spare bedroom.2. Then make your inlaws stay in your spare bedroom.3. That design/color scheme is about as appealing as puke!Sure to keep ANY unwanted inlaws from overstaying their welcome. :^|As for the material being stiff; so is a plastic automotive tarp.But they too soften with age.The design? Well, to each their own.Makes a great GIFT :^)"
4,A Good Deal,"I bought this set when it was $14.99, and I think it was a good deal. Not the prettiest set in the world, but not bad, especially for the price."
2,very disappointing,I was very disappointed when I received this set. Very rough exterior and very uncomfortable to use. I even felt it was too heavy. A strict no..no.I donated this to salvation the next week. Couldn't find a better use!
2,the item is not so much good,the item is ok ...the way they mentioned the item is so expensive etc etc ...it is nit so much good...but i got it for the price of 26$ i guess it is fine...definatly doen not worth 100's as listed.
5,Wonderful snuggle book!!!,"I began reading this book to my daughter when she was only 12 months old, and she LOVED it! 2 1/2 years later my son and daughter still ask me to read this to them at least once a day! It is wonderful to use as an interactive book to give and receive hugs and kisses. We read it every night before bed. The gentle rhyme is wonderful. It is also a beautiful song."
4,Children's Reader,This is a GREAT book to help children know how much they are loved. The story is engaging and touching. i would recommend this highly.
3,"Sweet, not great, but sweet.","It's a nice book, which uses the love of a mother bear for her cub to demonstrate God's love. It's a sweet book, not great, but sweet nonetheless. My two year old son likes it, particularly the illustrations."
4,"Frankenstein is the monster, not Frankenstein's monster","If this book had been written soon after Mary Shelley's, all the entertainment since garnered from Shelley's book for movies, Halloween, etc., etc. would not exist. Belefant completely reinterprets and overturns the popular Hollywood view of the novel. But the main point Belefant makes is valid and well-supported: the ""monster"" was Victor Frankenstein himself doing all the misdeeds to prevent himself (Victor) from committing his own apparently worst nightmare, incest. The arguments for this and other aspects of the original (such as, could have Frankenstein's laboratory really existed?) are interesting as well as presenting an almost titillating, though realistic view into Mary Shelley's life and times."
5,Don't Sleep,"Aaron is a comic literary genius. Plus, he's funny and politically on point. The Boondocks is one of the best places to get caught up on world events :-)"
1,Aaron McGruder - a prime example of talent wasted,"I used to like reading ""The Boondocks"" back when it first came out, and it featured more characters than just Huey and Caesar. It's no longer funny, and it's now just a way for the author to take whatever subject is biting his butt at the time and beat it into the ground (Bush is a bad president; Emimen is white and more successful than he is; the War in Iraq is wrong; BET is evil; most of the songs on the radio suck; OK, OK, we get it Aaron!!!) Buy the first volume instead, it will remind you when ""The Boondocks"" was still cutting-edge and relevant."
2,"too small, and not very practical","Unless you are after the Henckels name, this item is not worth much. It's too small to be used for anything, and the silicone pot holder is ... there are better ones out there, with magnets, for example."
3,Anchovy great; Almonds not so much...,"I'm a big anchovy fan. I enjoyed this product. The anchovies were flavorful with a nice texture. However, I don't think I'll order again because the almonds retained no almond flavor as they were completely overwhelmed by the anchovy flavor. I actually ended up eating them separately since they pretty much fell out of the anchovy rolled around them anyway. Also, this is a very small jar!"
5,"Good for the monney, and improved over older reviews","I bought these to use for sporting events, occasional bird watching and nature viewing. They meet my expectations as it relates to functionality. I've had no issues with double vision or other optical abnormalities. They are a value purchase for me (cheap enough to replace it damaged or lost) so I am satisfied overall.Ours came with a basic case and a relatively sturdy neck strap. Nothing fancy but wasn't expecting anything fancy. Bought directly from Amazon.com and item arrived quickly and without problems."
3,They are okay,Was hoping that the optics were of better quality but can't complain too much. Focusing is not as easy as it should be.
1,Poor optical alignment,"The bino's did not provide good sight alignment in the field of view. The picture you saw with your left eye was slightly offset from the picture you saw through your right eye, creating a 'dual image.' I have used many types of bino's in the past and was not impressed with these."
5,Good all around binocs,Excellent value in these all around binoculars. Easy to focus and you'll appreciate that they are armored when you drop them. Virtually indestructable. A frequent travel companion that stowes easily.
3,Nice but not for me,They are very nice looking but I could not get them to focus until after 40+ yards. Does not work well for me when bow hunting.
3,looks good but lots work,"it took me 6 hours to do it , i won buy some thing like that again,unless it's custom made which will fit even the wheel,do not take wrong looks good on it now but it's not tight around the spokes"
2,Not the best.,"I made 2 attempts with this product. The first was too small(even though the measurements matched up with my steering wheel). I ordered a 2nd that was bigger and it ended up barely fitting. Over half way through installation the leather rips near 2 of the holes, I didn't even pull the strings yet to tighten them! I guess the holes must have been lined up in just the right way that when I pulled the thread through it ripped. It does look nice, if you can block out the rip!"
3,Nice but very tight fit,"They dont carry the bigger size so i bought this one in hopes that itll fit tight but unfortunately this is very tight fit, almost not worth putting on. Im going to make my own at this point."
4,What Comfort!,"This is the most comfortable wheel cover I have ever put on a steering wheel. The color was spot on and it is so soft. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was due to the slight difficulty in putting in on. It was a little hard to put on, but if you take your time as I did, no problem."
2,Supplied thread is garbage.,Could not find a stitch on cover anywhere except online. Supplied thread is garbage. The good thread cost more than the wheel cover at the craft store. I would have rather paid extra for adequate thread. Cover looks ok though.
5,Could not put this down ...,I loved this book and could not put it down. Not only did Brown provide a human interest story of the people involved but he provided insight into the state of weather prediction of the time. The book was full of interesting information. I could go on but you simply have to read it. I disagree with the reader who suggested he needed a central focus. The storm was the central focus.
3,"Interesting Great Lakes history, a little dry","This was a interesting history of storms on the Great Lakes and how they affected shipping. At times the litany of names and dates was a little dry, but being from the Great Lakes area, I found it interesting."
3,Check it out!,"""Half Slave and Half Free"" discusses American life during the antebellum era. Specifically, he discusses the economies of both the north and the south. He looks at slave labor and free labor. He also looks at the differences between the North and the South and what lead up to the war.In all honesty, I thought this was a good book and an important read. It was perfect for a classroom setting (which is where I read it). However, I did get a little bored with all the statistics. I can't help it, I am by no means a number person. But the interesting parts of the book far out number the times I was a little bored by it. This was a vital book in understanding what lead up to the Civil War. And it was a valuable source for my term paper.Simply, Levine's work is thoroughly researched and well written. It is worth checking out!"
4,"Thorough, insightful.","Rarely, do I get excited about classroom readings however, Bruce Levine's Half Slave and Half Free is an insightful look at a pivtoal time in the history of the United States.Levine's argument in the text is that the deep regional divide which came to inspire the Civil War, was not founded on the principle of slavery but rather the contrast in the socioeconomic structures.An excellent look at the post revolutionary and pre Civil War United States."
4,Good History,"This is a well-written book, well researched and detailed. Well suited to either a serious student or someone who just wants to know a little more about what made us who we are today."
2,Ok but too fast,I thought that the DVD CD combo would be good but it ended up going way too fast and not pacing enough to learn the steps. I also found that the dances taught are ones most people probably wouldn't dance to at a wedding without taking professional dance lessons and choosing a specific song. Most modern music would not go with these kinds of dances. Overall I thought the steps went too fast and weren't that helpful.
4,Great DVD,"Steps are easy to follow. My future in-laws liked it so much, they asked me to order one for them!"
5,Excellant!!!!!!,My girl friend (too shy to write this) claims this does the job in record time!!!!!!
4,"Good Contents, No Case","The contents of the package are great, and they are made in the USA. I'm very pleased with the kit from this perspective, and it would make a great add-on to existing cleaning kits.The flaw, in my opinion, is that the case cannot be used for storage. To open the package, the clear cover must be destroyed, leaving only the flimsy yellow backing. Most other kits come with a molded hard plastic case or at least a clear clam shell case that can keep the parts together.Knowing this ahead of my purchase may have altered my selection, however only for the convenience of storage. The kit performs exactly as expected and appears to be high quality."
2,"For a horror fan, I guess I was disappointed...","Well...I dunno. Maybe I know a little bit too much about Korean culture to be 'surprised' or 'shocked at the twists and turns'....This was unfortunately, pretty standard ""school girl rivalry plot w/supernatural twist"" (lol, believe me in asia this is a standard)and I found it to be very predictable. And I'm not even that intuitive when watching mystery/movies.I love horror movies of all sorts but this was pretty weak by my standards. Also, for those who care, the soundtrack was quite nice. 2.5 stars? :/"
4,Good ghost story.,"I like and recomend it if you like, the more mental and less noisey, Asian style horror as opposed to the American style horror."
1,made in china,Unfortunately modern Chicago Cutlery knives are not from Chicago. Nor are they from any town in America. They are pale imitations of the venerable old blades and are made by Asian sub-contractors.These knives are not real cutlery. How the mighty have fallen.
5,Very Good Knife,"This knife is perfect for nearly all felleting tasks. It holds and edge well and sharpens easy. Just the right size for cleaning walleyes, but too big for small fish like perch."
3,Not what they used to be,"I have 3 Chicago Cutlery knives bought many years ago. They've held up well and they hold a good edge. They also cost real money when I bought them so I should have suspected this one was not quite the same. Sure enough it's made in China, not Chicago. It's an okay knife but doesn't hold an edge as well as the others. The handles also are not well matched to the steel tang leaving a ridge of metal poking out all around the grip. The original knives were perfectly finished and comfortable to use.Overall, if this is a typical example of what Chicago Cutlery now produces, they can no longer be considered a good alternative to the expensive European made knives. They used to be the professional's secret bargain. Sadly, no more."
3,"Solid overview of the thirteen colonies, read with caution","This book provides a solid overview of the thirteen colonies and their founding. Alderman intersperses his narrative with occasional anecdotes that will keep the readers attention. Each chapter follows a pattern of discussing the founding of the colony, history, government, economy, and wars. I found it to be a useful tool for my middle school students to use as a reference while doing a project on the thirteen colonies (I took every book out of the school library that dealt with the colonies).However, the book does support some historical myths such as Peter Miniuit purchasing Manhattan for $24. It also uses outdated language (once referring to Indians as ""redmen"") in addition to being clearly biased against one group or another. It is not a professional history but it does it's job decently."
4,Index for the 17-volume DGG Beethoven Bicentennial Collection,"This slim, concise volume is a handy reference, if (and only if) you have the 17-volume (85 LP) Beethoven Bicentennial Collection, issued by Deutsche Grammophone in the 1970s. Especially useful since, for example, the piano sonatas are spread across three different volumes, in no particular order. One index lists the works alphabetically/numerically, along with their location (volume, side and band). Another index lists the artists alphabetically with their works performed. The third index simply lists the contents of each volume and side. All in all, one is saved from pulling out multiple volume boxes to find a particular work."
2,not a great ring,"The ring came about three sizes too big, and the little heart gem slipped out of place within three hours of me wearing it. I am very disappointed."
3,don't go by the picture,"the picture of the ring shows a clear heart shaped stone. i bought this ring, not for intentions of using it as an engagement ring. but, i expected at least an actually heart shaped stone. the stone is more shield shaped and has no divet for the top of the heart."
5,first thai cookbook,I bought this book because I love thai food and I thought it's time for me to learn how to cook it rather than eating out all the time. This book is great. There are some ingredients that are hard to find in regular supermarkets like shrimp paste or lemongrass but easy to find in online ethnic stores (go to thaitemple.com or ethnicgrocer.com for example). I look forward to cooking from this book because I know that it's always going to turn out great. One thing though is the portions are kind of small for two people so you should increase the ingredients by one third or more.
1,Poor Pad Thai,"I have to admit I only made one recipe--pad thai--from this cookbook, but it was really bland. I used top quality fish sauce, freshly roasted the peanuts, and used grilled shrimp in a lemongrass marinade, and still the outcome was bland. This is obviously an incomplete review since I only made one recipe, but I can't imagine buying a book on Thai cooking that produces a poor version of one of the most popular Thai dishes in the U.S."
4,Good Cheap Starter Book,"I should give it 5 stars for the price. It's a book full of troubleshooting detail, but you have to learn the material to find it. For an example, he mentions to be careful of sulfuric acid contamination in the refrigeration oil under the title of ""Compressor Testing"". If you flip pages and see only the broad titles you'll miss the good stuff. Most HVAC guys come in on a hot day and just replace the compressor units because the store operator is frantic (after cleaning coils and charging the unit). This ""oldie but goodie"" book will teach you how to do a continuity test on a hermetically sealed 3 phase motor to see if it's still good. Is it a motor winding insulation leak, winding break, or locked rotor? Explains what can lock up a rotor. Perfect starter book for the maintenance guy who wants to make some side money fixing tossed equipment like Store or Hotel ice machines."
2,Out of Date and Very Basic,This book is an excellent primer for someone that has no prior knowledge of A/C systems. It is very dated and lacks information on the newer systems and refrigerants.
3,Strugle To See,"This is a great book to have. The format is perfect and it's written so, a chicken could understand it.However , there's one little major problem in my opinion. FOR ME, THE TEXT IS TOO SMALL. Please take into consideration, people with impaired vision. If it's possibe, have an option on your webpage for people with impaired vision to be able to select books wih larger text.I love to read and would probably purchase books more frequent if I had an option to purchase books with larger print."
3,Readable but not enough information,"Some more tips and more detail would have been better. I don't think the book is complete enough. I guess it's always a compromise between an encyclopedia and outline. Some repairs just take hands on illustration. I found more information on NATE and lasvegas.ac on how to repair air conditioners. I don't think a book can replace a hands-on repair course. Some things are do it yourself and some things should be left to certified professionals. But as far as readability, its OK."
5,Stretch A Child's Imagination!,"Most significantly, I'd like to note that I read this book 40 years ago...and could still remember it's name! As I recall, it's about a very small elven character that could fit in the palm of your hand.A very novel concept to a small child who lives in a world of things much larger than they are. It made me pay attention to 'small things' rather than the 'large ones'! A whole new perspective!I became a detail oriented person which remain a personal habit today and I credit that to a silly child's book I read so long ago. It might prove beneficial to a child that ignores detail because the idea that this character sleeps in a window sill also makes you notice the dust you overlooked there when last you cleaned your room and I promise you, as a child full of imagination, you start looking in window sills to make sure nothing is sleeping there...or perhaps to imagine that they do!Just good fun reading! Most memorable!"
5,Really big tongs,"I gave this item a five star rating because of its high quality and bargain price. I have been using ordinary kitchen tongs with my Weber BBQ grill for years and bought this pair as a step up to a ""professional grade"" tool. I might have overdone it just a little. These well made tongs are huge and rather cumbersome for turning a hotdog or an ear of corn on the grill. The tongs would work just fine with a rack of ribs or a huge steak, but I seldom cook that large. I now know that I probably didn't need professional grade tongs. However, you serious outdoor chefs would really like these things."
2,What is the length og these tongs?,"yes they may be 430 steel but a critical demension has to be the length, yet it is not listed any where in the product description."
4,good plastic wrap,"I originally bought this and was intending to use it for a sculpture, but since then I have used it for many things. It resists heat well (I poured melted was on it)and sticks well to itself (but is also holds a lot of static). It is very bulky and I probably wood have preferred the smaller size, because of this I cannot use it for many things, but I will use it when I move. All in all a very quality plastic wrap, and lots of it!"
5,Stretch-Flex,This product worked great! We were moving from Texas to Florida and we wrapped all the fragile furniture with stretch wrap and furniture pads. Not a scratch anywhere!
4,Hard to use but effective,"This product is somewhat hard to use although I don't think any other brand would be easier. The items we covered with this stayed scuff-free, although it is important to realize that the plastic doesn't protect items from big bumps and scratches - for really important stuff, moving blankets in conjunction with this would be great."
2,STINKS bad.,"This stuff stinks very bad, when you tightly wrap it, it changes from chemical smell to burning plastic smell. I had to make sure nothing in my house was on fire at first because of the smell."
4,Stretch Wrap,"We used this product to wrap couches to be stored during construction. With multiple people, it was not difficult to apply"
3,Some What helpful,"I got this book recomended by the proffesor and thought it would be very helpful. In teh begining it was but as the semester went of things we did in class were not in this mannual. So it wasnt much use to me, but could be helpful if your teacher follows teh book!!"
3,Biology Lab Photo Atlas,"This atlas is good, but not very in depth information found. It should include more diagrams and information for the amount of money being asked for it."
4,Happy Customer,"I got this well on time and in like new condition, just like they said I would. I was very satisfied with the seller."
5,Rachel Gold and Her Friends Are The Greatest!,"I've just finished this latest of Michael Kahn'sbooks, and I eagerly await his next! His characters are so fully developed and interesting. Ifyou like Marcia Muller, Sara Paretsky, and SueGrafton, you'll thoroughly enjoy ALL of MichaelKahn's books.This one is the best so far. Thepremise alone is so interesting & different! Whowould have thought animal by-products would be areason for murder!"
3,too easy,"I am not a reader who actively searches for clues in a mystery. Usually, I just go along for the ride. In ""Sheer Gall"", I'm sorry to say, a big element of the solution was so obvious that, in spite of Mr. Kahn's smooth writing and likeable characters, I had trouble continuing to the end of the book. Hence only three stars. But for that, it would have been a 4. I would like to see more of Rachel Gold."
3,Fuse,"While what I ordered is what I received - the challenge is that the discription of the product was not clear enough to eliminate it as what I really needed, therefore the purchase was a waste. More importantly was the shipping and handeling price was greater than the cost of the product. Considering that the item was a small box of fuses it was rather shocking to find out it cost over $7.00 to ship. I suspect most of the ""handeling charges"" were due to Amazon's cut of the money so next time I will bypass Amazon and go directly to the source to reduce the charges."
2,Not a great resource,"Outdated and vague. Mainly drawings that are hard to understand because they are hard to read. Not organized as a book should be, rather just a collection of mechanical drawings. Save your money."
1,An Official Waste of Money,I guess it depends what you are looking for in a guide. If it's information about sites than look elsewhere. Even the heavy sites of Paris only get a page or so. This book is heavy on background info and is aimed at the American tourist. This book did not help me at all on my trip.
3,Levittown book not as good as I expected,"Having grown up in the town, there was a lot more that could have been covered in this book. The book was written and focused on a few families and not as many 1950s places were reviewed and photgraphed, such as the roller rink, Jolly Rogers, Mays Department Stores, Woolworth's ice cream sundaes. etc."
4,Old-school so ahead of its time it's nu-school -,"I came across this CD by surprise, but once I found out it was released only in France on the seminal TIGERSUSHI label, I knew it was gonna be good - and wasn't let down. A fascinating, eye-opening, jaw-dropping, and even highly-educational selection of the cream of the obscure, cult 70s/80s French electro/no-wave/synth-pop/punk movement - as compiled by BLACK STROBE's IVAN SMAGGHE - I know a lot of music, but many of these bands/singles I had never heard of, and they're all flawless in their own DIY way - if you like bands like The Normal, early Mute stuff, John Carpenter soundtracks, etc., this is for you!"
4,A good read,"I've just finished reading this on Kindle, as others have said a bit dry. My biggest complaints were the amount of typos & english errors, did no one proof read it? Also I hoped to find out more abouts the boats & Higgins thinking behind the designs but that is not covered. The ending is a bit abrupt as well, but that is unfortunately the way the Higgins story ends!"
1,Trow this cd to the garbage!,"The string concerto is Haendel's stuff. The hanging gardens is a beautiful piece, this is the very WORST version ever! The singer does not sing, she ""cuacks"". Robert Craft was a Stravinsky's fan...No good here no good elsewhere...Chose rather Viennese conductors for Schönberg!Naxos, cheap again! Just good for old recordings without having to pay copyrights.I'm not disappointed, I got what I paid for...Martin Pitchon, angry"
5,Sandoku knives,"As an asian, the sandoku knife is a must in my kitchen. And I'm so glad Henckels came up with its own version of this asian must-have, considering the Henckels brand is a leader in this field!!!!"
5,Best RPG in Decades,"I was heartbroken to learn that Alternity has been cancelled by TSR, and my heartbreak was compounded once I got my hands on Dark Matter. If you are a fan of any government conspiracy, unmarked helicopter, alien abduction, bigfoot type realms, this is the campaign for you. If you aren't a fan, you will be after you read it. I'm a regular conspiracy nut, and all the biggies are covered by Baur and Cook; their research was fantastic. Also, everything from vampires to greys and sasquatches and mummies are present, and they tie into the conspiracies beautifully! If you don't buy this one, you're missing out on one of the RPG finds of a lifetime. Well done to Baur adn Cook, poorly done to TSR for the cancelation. Get it while you still can..."
5,Midiman good,"This is a great Coax to Optical converter that is bi-directional(that's right it goes both ways)so it can convert whichever form of digital fitting you have to the opposite type of fitting. I am using it for digital recording and basically the Midiman passes the digital signal through to my Firepod from a preamp...not extrmely sexy and a bit pricey at $70.00+ with the two neccessary cables, but I am confident that the signal is being transmitted with its original integrity intact. this is my first M-Audio product and so far so good."
2,Could be more meaningful.,"My wife n i had the impression that the show will compare the developing stages of the 4 babies but it wasn't clear. We'd have preferred if they compare, for eg, the 4 babies learning to crawl/walk despite living in a different environment. There was such an attempt but it wasn't clear. Some shots seemed random while others irrelevant. For instance there was one where an adult was milking a cow with no baby in sight. Given the choice again, i wouldn't have bought it."
2,too long,"I like babies just as much as the next person, but I just didn't enjoy this movie much. There was no narration, minimal on-screen talking. Just babies. Babies from here, babies from there, just being babies. Which is fine and dandy by me, I probably would have enjoyed it had it been a 30 minute show on TV, but an 80 minute movie was too much for me. I got bored halfway through and would have rather turned it off. I left it on, hoping something interesting may happen.. it never does. I guess maybe I was expecting too much from a movie about babies.Baby Human: Geniuses in Diapersis very interesting, though. It gets into the inner-workings of babies, and you learn lots of interesting things about them. But, if all you're looking for is a bunch of ""cute"" babies to mindlessly stare at for nearly and hour and a half, this may be just what you're looking for. Not my cup of tea, however. I would not recommend this."
3,Sweet Babies,There are some adorable babies in this film. The different lifestyles is amazing. But in spite of thatbabies make the world a much better place. I enjoyed this short film.
2,Odd movie!!!,"Did not enjoy this movie! What a waste of my time! Especially the fact that they picked a totally hippie couple for the USA baby story. Make us look a little crazy in America (the whole mother earth will take care of use song). Couldn't understand the emphasis on why everybody had to be naked. Just bizarre that to go in a hot tub with your baby you'd be naked? I think they're trying to spin off who ""ACCEPTING"" we are in America. Anyway see for yourself and decide."
1,"Disappointed, should be rated PG-13","I was eager to see this movie as I love babies and am raising six children. Given the PG rating I thought it would be appropriate for my children to view, with discussion at certain points in the film. I expected a focus on the babies reacting to their varied environments. I understood going into it that there would be some maternal nudity involved given the lifestyle of the Namibian family. I was not prepared for the seeming focus on the mothers and their nudity. I was particularly not fond of a scene in which the American mother was in the hot-tub nude with her baby outside her home. I would not recommend this film."
3,Everybody Is Mad At Me,"It was my turn to choose a movie. I dont know anything about movies. I had to choose. I chose this Babies thing. In a nutshell its about babies. Not how they are made, how they are raised, what they are doing here. It just about them. They dont have speaking parts so its hard to understand them sometimes. If you love babies, you will like this movie. If you just like babies pretty good, you might make a choice different from me. I liked this movie, but I wouldnt watch it again, especially in mixed company, those who like babies mixed with those who dont so much. For the volume of babies this movie has in it, I give it high marks."
3,Babies Cry A Lot,"Babies cry a lot. And hit their siblings a lot. That's what I got out of this documentary. I appreciate the idea behind the documentary, which is wonderful, show the similarities and differences between having babies and raising babies across four different cultures around the world. However, after 30 minutes, I had enough of the story, and just fast-forwarded to the end. I mean, there's only so much cute baby footage one can take.Recommended strongly for parents of babies, or people thinking about becoming parents."
5,Delight for the whole family!,"I rented this and was pleasantly surprised at the depth and beauty. Marvelous cinematography and musical score. The best feature is that there's no dialogue or typical plot. Yet my whole family was riveted (husband, three children 5-12). The kids requested an encore the next day, even! Loved it."
5,Disappointed,Video unplayable in Australia because Amazon haven't had regard for the region from where it is being purchased. Only playable in USA or on a computer five times. Such a shame as it is a great documentary.
1,super boring,super boring movie. no narration at all makes all the footage seem pointless & disconnected. wouldn't recommend this to anyone & wish we hadn't rented it. couldn't even finish it.
2,"Rent, don't bother buying.","I felt it was a little disjointed as it skipped from family to family. You had no chance to get to know them. For me it was also a bit outraging on how they chose to child care. One was often left alone the moment he was born (the child who was also brought home on a motorcycle, granted no objection as he drove slow.) but wow...as eye opening to other cultures as this movie is (yay) it also saddened me more than made me joyous.Oh and for you anti nudity, you may not want this if you are afraid of T**ts. ok? Yes, maternal and cultural nudity abounds. I love it but not everyone is on board with that. so heads up. By the way, I felt the african mother was by far the best mother doing what she could with her limited resources. The others who had it all seem to but baby last. And that angered me. I'm glad I only redboxed this thing."
2,Overly Sentimental Look at Four Tots From Around the World,"""Babies"" shows four newborns from different parts of the world -- Ponijao from Namibia, Bayarjargal from Mongolia, Mari from Tokyo, and Hattie from San Francisco.This is a movie that will either inspire such comments as ""Awwwwwww"" or be avoided completely by folks with an aversion to blatant sentimentality. Everyone loves seeing a cute baby, and the movie works on that basic level, but its purpose doesn't seem to go beyond showing adorable kids. Though we're seeing children from all over the world, I had the feeling I was watching an extended home movie.For those who care, a featurette revisits the babies and their parents three years later."
3,I should win a prize for watching this,"I don't think any man can enjoy this movie. I give it three stars because it has a lot of nudity. The worst part was the hippie moms in San Francisco chanting ""Earth is our mother."" One positive thing is that after watching this movie, I will never have sex without protection again. They should show this to all 13 year old boys to scare the living bejeezus out of them."
1,B.O.R.I.N.G,"I can't believe how many high stars this gets. Maybe it's just not my thing. I thought I would find it fasinating to watch, but it wasn't - boring as anything. I would have found it more enjoyable if maybe they talked about the different places and the different ways they raise kids there, but all your doing is watching babies move, cry, etc... I really don't understand the purpose of this film. To each their own I guess."
1,Let down,I was so excited for this movie to come out when I first heard about it. I thought it would give more facts about the different countries the babbies lived in and their customs for the children as they went threw the first year. But it is just a movie where you get a look at how other homes are else where.
4,revolutionary,"This is one of those films that really stands out from the rest, great job in doing something different and unique.I only wish there would be children from other continents like South Asia and Latin America."
5,Wonderful,My 3 year old was laughing out loud at this documentary. Who would have thought. I wish they was more like it out there.
3,Cute and fun to watch but...,"Aw, aren't they cute. Four babies, one from some remote African country, one from rural Mongolia, one from Japan and one from San Francisco are in fact, cute and fun to watch. Even at 80 minutes however, it starts to get monotonous. I guess the one takeaway, is that at birth up to about year one, babies pretty much are the same in any environment. Another might be that siblings treat their younger brothers and sisters equally bad. Perhaps the filmmaker plans on tracking down these kids every 5 years or so. That might be fun to follow, but in the form of a 60 minute National Geographic special."
3,Cute Movie,"The movie was interesting. The babies were very cute to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone expecting, it really opens your eyes."
4,Documentary,"I have wanted to see this since it was playing in theaters but never got the chance until I bought it. Over all its well done, but I would have liked if it was longer and slightly more in depth."
5,Awesome!,This film is great for new moms who want to set their minds at ease - there is more than one way to raise your baby. It also makes you realize we are all very similar! Totally worth seeing!
5,Great DVD,Watching how babies around the world interact with ther familiesyou learn that they all need care and love no matter where theyare from. Great DVD to show even in different cultures babiesare all the same.
4,Babies,"Babies. Some are born into wealthy families, some poor. Some are born with siblings, some alone. Some are raised by their parents, some are raised by extensions of their parents. However babies may come into the world - they constantly fight for our love and affection.Babies is a documentary style movie that follows the lives of four babies all over the world from the pregnancy to when they're old enough to go to pre-school. It is very educational and moving, some parts will have you saying ""Awww..."" and others will make you say ""Did that just happen?""By the end of the movie, it should have succeeded in poking at your curiosity about how other cultures raise babies. Thumbs up to the director for ending it before they got to that annoying toddler stage."
5,Adorable!,I have not had any babies but I was totally captivated by this movie. No dialogue - just babies being babies. It's amazing to see what is intuitive and natural to a baby and how their environment affects them. Loved it!
3,It's OK movie of 4 to 5 different cultures,"It is about bringing up a baby in 4 different cultures Africa, Tokyo, San Francisco, Mongolia, it is very interesting if you like culture differences. It is surprising at how the poorest boy is taken care of by the other children and loved by the whole family. Interesting at the attachment style from the Mongolian people and also the surprise association in the Tokyo and San Francisco babies."
5,Excellent,"I received excellent service. The item was sent to me immediately, it came quick and product was in perfect shape."
1,Not able play,Your DVD's are not working in European DVD-players!Your DVD's are not working in European DVD-players!Your DVD's are not working in European DVD-players!
4,Pretty much everything it promised,"I would have given this 4 and a half stars if I could have. It's only a little noisier than a fan and has cooled down my bedroom considerably, even during the recent heat spell, there was an occasional night I had to turn it off because I got cold. While it is a heavy unit and you do have to wait 24 hours to turn it on if it has tipped, it's easy to move along a flat surface, even a carpeted one. I do not recommend moving it up or down stairs without help. It does take up a bit more space than it says since you have to leave room for the exhaust tube. It's only major problem is the exhaust port which does not want to stay in the window even with using duck tape. I have yet to figure out how to secure it well. But after a month of use I have never had a leak or had to empty anything. So I think it balances out."
4,Good choice for portable AC,"For anyone looking for an affordable option of portable AC, this is a good choice."
3,It's an okay book,It was kind of old fashioned and got very boring in many parts but it had a good plot and was a very sweet story.
3,"Good, but old","This book must be pretty old...these people, Jane and Stan, are together for months and they don't even KISS!!! It's a good book for that old fashioned break from reality, but if you're looking for a good coming-of-age book, I suggest you look elsewhere!!! Coming of age should deal with problems we really face. Fifteen year olds are NOT worried about dinners in the city, what about pressure to have sex?? I'll admit it was a good book, but like I said, if you want to relate, try something newer. This book is just good for a cute little fairy tale."
5,Great without usual teen problems!,"This book was really good, I've read it many times. It's really cute because its sort of old fashioned and simple.Jane Purdy is just an average girl with hopes for a good romance and she gets it."
5,Sarah's Review,"I really liked this book a lot. And I would recommend this book to any girl around the age of 15. I read the book by Beverly Cleary called Fifteen. The story started out when Jane Purdy, a fifteen year old girl who never gets asked out on dates except by George a boy who is to short, has to baby-sit Sandra Norton the worst little girl. While she was there she met a boy named Stan. She thought she would never see him again but one day the phone rang and it was him! He asks her out on a date. She goes out with him again and again but then the trouble starts and Jane gets nervous."
5,A Classic,"This book is a story of the humorous adventures of a nice normal girl who wants to be someone with more sparkle. It takes a normal boy, some crazy mishaps, blunders & time to realize she's perfect just being herself. My mother read this book as I child. I've read this book more times that I can count. We have shared this book & the story it holds. I hope to someday share it with my daughter. I would recommend this book to any woman - mother or daughter - who has ever tried to impress a man by pretending she was someone other than herself. Mothers - if you read this book as a teen, do your daughter a favor and share this great book with her -- she will thank you for it. If you didn't read it then, start now!"
2,Not that good...,"The book was kind of lame. It did give me a glimpse of how people wanted to fantasize about the ""ever-perfect"" fifties where a girl was expected to wait around for a boy to call her and ask her out, never to have sexual feelings, only dull ""romantic"" ones. I notice Stan and Jane only kiss and make light talk. Jane is supposed to be funny, but comes across as dull. It's great that scoiety has become more civilized now. The BSC are lucky not to be around back then!"
2,Get over it,"First off, I am a fifteen year old in the late 90's. I read this book and was pacified by its writing, but not captivated by the story. Cute little Jane meets dog food deliverer Stan while babysitting a nightmare and he comes to her rescue? Come on, the guy walked right into the house, in today's society she would have called 911 and ran for her life. I know this book took place a while ago (definate understatement), but it should be retired. Nothing is offered here for a girl in the 90's except a hopeless dream. Times have changed too much. I bet, 40 years ago this book would have been amazing, but its days have passed."
5,This book is EXCELLENT!!!,"I loved this book soooo much!!I couldn't get myself away from it once I've started reading it,not even a second!It's just SO sweet!I love the story really really much.I enjoyed every single part of it,and as I was reading it,I felt as if I'm Jane and it always brings a smile on my face(gosh!!as if I was crazy)It was too good to be true!(it's a real story right Beverly??)What I want to say is that:Thanx for writing us such a good book Beverly,please do inform me if there's any (new)books like this one!!"
4,This book is pretty good!,"I thought this was a very sweet book. The story and idea behind it was cool, and was pretty much true to life. It was a down to earth story and was a quick and easy read. I recommend it to anyone!"
4,Luv at 15,A 1950's novel by popular YA author Beverly Cleary which while a tiny bit daggy is also a page turner.Cleary took a very simple situation....a 15 year old girl gets her first boyfriend...and turns it into a long and extremely interesting story.
4,The exact life of a 15 yr. old girl,"This book was an amazing book by Beverly Cleary. It talks about Jane a fifteen yr. Old girl who is just struggling with regular teen age problems. She meets a boy named Stan and they start dating. She doesn't know what they are... like boyfriend/girlfriend, just friends, or dating buddies so she gets really confused. Her trials between her parents meeting her new friend and the anticipation of if Stan is going to call again for another date makes this book exciting and having the reader wait for what's going to happen next."
4,Great Book,Great Book! We are a 6th - 12th grade school and this book stays checked out. I bought this copy as a replacement. The binding is very good.
5,THIS BOOK IS INCREDIBLE!!!!!,"this book is not meant for the subjects mentioned below. this book is a great getaway, from the ""pressures of sex"" and doing ""more than kissing."" hey, this book was written in a completely different era! when things like that weren't so important to adolescents. it was a time when things like ""only kissing"" mattered a lot. when people could be happy just being together in a malt shop instead of sleeping around! believe me, i would rather have that kind of romance. it was a sweet story how jane and stan get together despite the odds. readers should know when the pick up FIFTEEN that their picking up a sweet, sentimental old fashioned book, not a trashy romance novel. I'm 17 and i still love the book! so do yourself a favor, get out of this trashy decade for a couple hours and live a little with an entirely wonderful book!!!"
3,It is good but not good enough.,"Timm's textbook tries to involve a lot topics pertaining to multivariate analysis. So it is more comprehensive than Johnson and Wichern's Applied multivariate statistical analysis. Moreover, the book uses SAS program to illustrate some examples, which are available from the website of the textbook. In this way, the content of the book are actually doubled. SAS examples also help students to learn how to use SAS to solve problems.Some weaknesses includes 1). many typos are found the textbook; 2). the explanation about some foundamental theories is not as clear as that in Jonhson and Wichern's book."
1,Confusing,As a Current 19d in the Army National Guard I was excited to find out there was finally a fiction novel about our very exciting but overlooked military profession. That is untilI read this Horrable book. This book is confusing and sinical there is no real plot and the ending is down right retarded.I am ashamed that out Military Profession has been insulted in this way.
1,Move out and draw fire!,"I hate to do this to a fellow Cav Scout but this book was really bad. As a Cavalry Scout who fought at the battle of 73 Easting during Operation Desert Storm, I'm here to tell you that when it comes to combat operations this book really misses the mark. This book had more in common with a Rambo movie than anything else. Save your money and pick up a copy of Harold Coyle's book ""Team Yankee"", If you really want insight into whats it's like on a modern day battlefield. It's an oldie but a goodie, even though it's pro Tanker.(You Scouts will get that one.)SCOUTS OUT"
2,"""Cavalry Scout"" Throws a Track.","I have recently finished ""Cavalry Scout"" by Mr. Dennis Michels. I have served as a Cavalry Scout in the United States Army for 12 years, working my way to the rank of Staff Sergeant and Platoon Senior Scout. Mr. Michels obviously was a scout, he proves this by his knowledge of the job demonstrated in the book. However I found this work to be dismal and confusing at best. I hate to bash a fellow scout and his hard work but this book is poorly written, the language is confusing, the plot is weak and there are some completely unrealistic scenes that occur. The worst example is the fratricide incident and the author's complacient attitude afterwards. This book is an unrealistic view into the world of the armored reconnaisance specialist. I am happy, however, that the Cavalry Scout has been brought into the genre of military fiction."
5,You will be transported to another dimension,"Excellent book for anyone seeking enlightment and evolution. Once you start reading it you don't want to stop until you finish it. Find a pleasant atmosphere and a confortable place to read it, you will be tranported to another dimension while you are reading it."
2,"Nice sound, short lifetime","Nice sound, very happy with them the first weeks, but 2 months later one side (Left) died. I'll see for the 90 day warranty if Panasonic makes the change. Buy them for travel or for the kids, not as your permanent earphones. Not recommended."
4,Good earphones for the price,"I got these earphones for $5, and it was definitely worth it. They're pretty good and have nice sound quality (at least as good as the iPod earphones but probably a bit better). They have a weird bump on them to try and make them fit in your ear better which gets annoying at times but overall they aren't bad. so if you're looking for some decent earphones and want to spend a small amount of money, I would recommend these."
4,has more bass but not crazy bass,These do have more base. the magnet is so strong you can touch the magnet to something and feel the pull.I guess for the coin they are good but did not blow my mind.
4,"Pretty good, particularly for the price","The headphones are pretty good, especially considering how reasonable they were. They are much louder than the headphones that came with my iPod. They fall out a little bit more easily than others I've had, but it's not annoying enough to prevent me from using them."
2,Really bad sound... and i'm not even an audiophile,"Bad sound, no bass AT ALL, very hollow mid and highs. I'm not even an audiophile by any stretch so buy this for an emergency and don't expect some good sound (not at least for rap). I've had the Philips Hook earphones bought from amazon for the same price and they sound MUCH MUCH better than these. BAD BUY, ALONG WITH NOT BEING ABLE TO ENJOY GOOD MUSIC = 2 stars"
2,Sucks.,"These headphones really suck. The sound quality seemed decent at first, but now it is just really bad, even compared to the apple headphones. Comfort is at rock bottom, the plastic on the headphones just hurt your ear. There are actually many more options on amazon for a 5 dollar price range that could suit your needs. The only upside to these headphones are that they havent broken for me yet."
2,Dont work for i pod or sansa radio,this headphone only work for my computer but not for my i pod and my sansa radio and i needed for those.
3,Bargain,"For the price these headphones can't be beat. The best part is that they don't sound bad. Quality seems good so far, however, I'm not sure how long they will ultimately last.Edit: I was able to purchase this item for about $5. They're good, but i doubt that they're worth $15."
2,Mixed review,The sound is excellent but the buds are way TOO large and fall out of the ears. I will be giving them away...
2,Decent For The Price,"For the price you get them at, these headphones are definitely a bargain. However, they're a bit uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time because of how the plastic -- I'm not sure about others, but the one I got, at least, was a bit sharp around the edges. Because of this, and the fact that they also feel very, very light, they appear to be cheaply made and I was worried about the quality upon receiving them.As for the sound, it becomes a bit distorted at higher volumes and you can hear a slight ""white noise"" in the background.I bought these quite a while ago and for some reason, they didn't last very long. I know some people have said they've lasted a good year, but they only lasted me about three-four months before they started to deteriorate. I bought them when they were only $5, so I wasn't upset about the loss, but now that they're $15, I definitely would not purchase them again."
3,Feedback,"These cheap little ear buds are fine except a faint static feedback that is ever present. Other than that, they're flawless."
2,cord tangles easily; too long,"The sound quality on these is fine. My gripe with them is that the cord is extremely long and very thin, so it very easily get tangled up in itself. Every time I go to use these I have to spend 5 minutes untangling the cord which is extremely annoying."
3,cheap and adequate,"I don't use these for listening to high fidelity playback, but for talk radio and casual listening these do fine. More expensive buds aren't needed for that."
4,great earbud for the money,"I am an adult male, and these earbuds fit my ear great. The sound is similar to an ipod style earbud, with an vert good high and mid range, and the bass range is average/good.Does the job."
2,I guess I got what I paid for,"I bought them because they were cheap and they got good reviews. They are not good for running. The are uncomfortable to put in my ears because of their shape, the cord is heavier than others I had which only becomes annoying if you're running. The sounds quality is also worth about $5. I'm never buying cheap headphones again, it's just a lot of little things that make a more expensive pair worth it. Though to be fair, I did only pay five dollars for them, so with that in mind I guess they weren't bad."
1,Very bad sound,"Don't waste your money, the sound of this headphone is very bad.And the price is too expensive to this bad quality."
1,broken within 8 weeks,"The item arrived on time, the seller's customer service was very nice but the item broken within 8 weeks. I called Panasonic and after four different phone transfers gotten handed up at the end, good thing it was only $3.99."""
4,Great Sound!!,"Excellent earbuds for the price. THey are not real comfortable, don't have the cushion, like my others. But the sound is good. They do fall out of the ear occasionally, but still worth the money!"
3,Cheap- and you get what you pay for.,"Well...they're cheap, that's for sure.Fit: Pretty poor. There's no foam sleeve or outer wrap to help the earbud stay securely in the outer ear. So they feel as if they'll easily fall out if they are not placed exactly the right way.Sound: Pretty poor. There's NO bass whatsoever. Sound really lacks any definition. So...be forewarned.But, they ARE cheap."
3,Good as a last resort for headphones,"These headphones delivered acceptable sound, not anywhere near as good a quality as I would expect from something over $20. They also feel really fragile, the cheap plastic they were made with feels like if I gave them a short tug to pull them out of my pocket I would sever the cord which made me take extra care with them.However, for the price these have acceptable quality (I got them for free thanks for prizeguide.tk) and are excellent candidates for a temporary replacement."
1,I will never buy a cheap item again.,This items is very bad. Its sound level is very low. My advice to you is not to buy this item.
2,Poor Bass. Buy other ones instead.,"The sound on these is fairly clear, but the bass tones are very poor.The item features describe this as having an XBS Port that increases bass response--However, there is no mention of this anywhere, either on the earphones or the packaging. I don't see any sign of such a port, and the bass response is far inferior to other small earbud headphones I have had (by Philips and AIWA).I'm not a bass fanatic or anything, and I'm not trying to pump any bass drumbeats-- I'm just looking for good, balanced overall sound quality for music.Don't take the chance-- Spend a little more for better ones, if you care about your overall sound quality and the bass.Really. I'm serious- Ignore the reviews that say that the sound is full. I believed them, and now I have to return my item."
2,Not that great,"I should have known by the price, but these have quite cheap quality. I thought they would be at least like not-so-fancy ones you might get with an MP3 player, but not really. The sound quality isn't so good, but is bearable. What bugs me the most is they keep falling out of my ears, probably mainly because they have no cushion padding.If all you want is a cheap pair of earbuds for sitting there and don't care much about sound quality, then these might be fine for you."
2,CRAPP BISCUIT,"Just got these earbuds. The sound is not rich...it is tinny and ""thin."" They occasionally crackle.I've only been using these for ten minutes but I doubt I will change my mind."
3,Good but not great,"Good sound for price. My real complaint is how it fits. The left one constantly needs to be adjusted as I am walking. If it slides down a little, the sound is not as good. Bass is ok and treble is ok. You get what you pay for."
1,Not comfortable,"I ended up returning this product because after about 15 minutes, the insides of my ears were hurting. They were not comfortable at all."
1,Cheap,"They're like McDonald's hamburgers - they look much better in the pictures. In reality, they are cheap, flimsy and don't produce sound very well. Very disappointed with this product."
5,Fantastical.,"The item arrived on it's expected arrival date in a brand new package. The length of the headphones was abut a meter (just right), and the sound is AMAZING. Actually, surprisingly better then standard apple earbuds. Pleasure to do service with you."
4,Decent for Price,"They are almost standard earphone, sound is clear and can be loud if you need it to be. You can hear the difference if your going to use EQ a bit.Comfort is average, it's plastic ear-piece so after an hour or 2 it can get uncomfortable.For $6 and change its pretty good, Don't expect a Bose comfort but if you need to hear your music for a low price I would recommend this."
4,Good earphones,"Quality earphones for the gym - nothing too fancy, but get the job done and are reliable."
1,Don't Last,"I purchased these earbuds on April 29th.Today is May 16th and one of the buds have no sound.I didn't expect them to last forever, but a couple of weeks is lame."
2,Thin wires tangle often,"The sound is fine, and the ear buds are comfortable. The wires are thin compared to other ear buds, and are prone to tangling. I spend several minutes untangling the wires every time I pull them out of my back. That gets irritating after a few times."
3,Slightly uncomfortable.,"I think these are good quality ear buds and the sound is great, but unfortunately they hurt my ears because of their shape."
1,Garbage!!,Garbage!! not much else to say. Horrible sound quality. I would feel bad asking my neighbors kid to listen to them.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"These headphones have poor sound quality. Although, for the price I can't really say I'm surprised. I just don't understand how these headphones have so many good reviews with people talking about how great the sound that comes out of them are. They also feel flimsy and cheap. Heck, these headphones are so bad they make my Zune's stock headphones seem like premium headphones. If you're looking at these headphones, I would suggest you buy something else. I can't even believe that they're selling for about $14 now. I bought them for $5 a few months ago and I still regret buying them."
4,Great bargain,"I bought these earphones to replace the original ones that came with my iPod. The sound is incredible! For the price, these are great earphones to use with any musical device (i.e. mp3 players). My only complaint is that they are ""hard,"" with no soft edge, so they're slightly uncomfortable if you have small ears. Still, they're worth the trouble--I've heard things through these I never heard through my original iPod ear buds!"
4,Worth the money.,"The earbuds are great. They are a tiny bit uncomfortable and easily fall out of my ears. However, the sound is terrific which makes up for the small flaws."
2,horrible sound,"the sound on these is garbage. i enjoy bass in my music and being able to hit all ranges. however, the sound quality on these is extremely poor. if you like purely treble in your music they would not be a bad choice."
1,"This toy is a good idea, it just doesn't work","The way this toy works is that there are six slots in which youcan put different type of mini size candy bars. But the slotsonly hold two bars each. When you make a selection, you canput money in the machine or not, and then push the yellowbutton just below your choice. But for us, every time wepushed a yellow button, both bars came out. We could almostlive with the fact that we could only put in two bars at a time,but the fact that both bars came out when you pushed the buttonjust completely ruined it for us. Also, the machine is smallerthan you would expect. It did fit the dimensions given in theproduct description, but somehow I was expecting something alittle bigger anyway. This is a neat idea, but skip this toy."
4,its not enough,"but its informative for somebody interested in a brief read. this book doesn't crack the tip of the iceberg on the subject of the Russian mafia, but it is a nice introduction"
2,A bad book on an important topic,"The topic is very important, and it ought to be debated and investigated with much more energy than has been the case so far. But Friedman must have written this book in ten days or two weeks only. The writing is hasty, the analysis is shallow. This only helps those who seek to deny the enormity of the problem."
1,Not quite believable,"Sorry, I wanted to like this but I found some of the stories not quite believable --- like the death threat, it just didn't ring true --- and the rest of them a compilation of press clips. Too bad."
3,Topic is important but a little bit naive context,"May be the facts in the book really existed, but the connection between the facts and people and resume of the book are naive. Only Russians without their western partners could not create so big criminal system."
5,Scary!,"This is a great book and a super-fast read. How unlucky for us readers that the author, Mr. Friedman died this summer. I was looking forward to more books."
3,"Great Stories, Bad Survey","If you want to read some great stories about the wild Russian-Jewish mobsters who've been operating in New York for the past three decades, you'll enjoy this book. If you expect a comprehensive survey of Russian gangs now active in the US, you'll be disappointed. Red Mafiya deals only with the gangsters Friedman calls ""Brighton Beach Goodfellas."" He ignores the hundreds of other USSR-born mafiyas--Russian, Ukranian, Chechen, Armenian, Georgian--many of which are better-disciplined, bigger, and altogether much likelier candidates to dominate the American crime business."
1,Designed to sell,"Although it is extremely easy to read and tells a very exciting story of the new developments in the US underworld, 'Red Mafiya' is ultimately a book designed to sell and scare you. A lot of the 'facts', especially about origins of Russian organised crime are manipulated or simply made up to make the story sound better. The rest of the book is very unprofessional: conclusions are not backed by evidence, anectodal style, and full of unbelievable tales. Anyone interested or researching the topic should avoid it."
5,Inciteful and Highly Readable,"A real eye-opener. Friedman writes about some pretty ruthless, cruel people. I don't know how the author could have possibly obtained all the information that he did; he is a brave man. I hope he's still alive, and will be amazed if he is, given the nature of the people about whom he has written. Friedman describes Russian Mafiya types operating in Toronto, near to where I live -- very unnerving. Mind you, if you live in NYC, Miami, Denver, San Francisco or Los Angeles, you are not alone..."
4,The best acoustic guitar album I've heard yet,"This is a live recording of 10 highly accomplished guitarists - all advanced participants in Robert Fripp's Guitar Craft seminars. The playing here is highly precise, with an emphasis on tight, complex teamwork, to wonderful musical effect. Especially gratifying is Nigel Gavin's (now of Gitbox Rebellion) composition on the opening track, which leads off with what sounds to me like a bit of a microtonal tribute to Harry Partch. I'm also very fond of the hidden 'non performance', and the additional 'hidden' track.If you're sick to death of the tired guitar repertoire they play on classical radio stations, this is a tremendous genre-free antidote"
3,Just Ok,"These are a good back up for if you run out of depends. They would be good to use until you can get to the store because these are washable. However,they are not strong enough for heavy duty incontinence."
3,Everyone settle down.,"I would hazard that Sushim Mukerji from Edison, NJ, and the many many other people who are creating such a ruckus about this book have not read it (in spite of the quotes Sushim offers, which happen to be copied verbatim from an email floating around).Read a book, then offer your opinion, you numbskulls. This is America. Remember freedom of speech? First Amendment rights? No one is forcing you to buy it, so stop condemning it. You do your own cause more damage by making noise and forwarding emails to your friends, you ignorant morons."
5,Great book of truth,"This is a great book. Book of truth. Whenever truth comes out, it hurts some times. The brahmins have created hundreds of gods in India to divert peoples attention. Once this is achieved, they have been swindling India and the Indian people for thousands of years, on the pretext of religion. All the non-brahmin Indians should read this book and wake up against the brahmin agendas. Good job Paul!"
1,Peddler of Pornography?,"The main academic interest in this book is the fascinating demonstration of the standards of Emory University where the author is on the Faculty and Administration.If you want to buy pornography, I'm sure there must be classier stuff available than Paul Courtright's filth. This guy sees a ""(Paulus?)"" in an elephant's trunk (do they teach anatomy at Emory University?) When he looks at a child (Ganesa is primarily a child-God to Hindus), his main interest is whether the (""Paulus""?) is ""Erect"" or ""Flaccid""! Sorry to use such language, but its accurately representative of what you'll read, starting Page 4, if you pay money for this filth. The author does not belong in a classroom - or anywhere loose in society. Sick and utterly disgusting!As for ""intellectual merit"", this stuff wouldn't pass the standards of the Ku Klux Klan. No wonder the publisher withdrew the book and apologized!"
1,Ignorance is not bliss,"First of all, Its sad that a 'Professor' in religion study dept doesnt know about wat he is writing ! He at once established his ignorance .There are many other good ways to get popular Mr Paul . The book cover is very disgusting. Author is a LOSER . My suggestion to CONFUSED 'Mr Krishna kumar' is to put a 'red 'kerchief in his front pocket and join a communist party . Nobody can change these pessimistic guys in the world ."
1,atrocious,Anybody who has the slightist sense of respect to others sentiments should stop at once. It is one thing to have freedom of speech and another to scrutinise something that is based on beliefs. Mr. Paul there is no guarantee that what you have written about Ganesh is in any way true so kindly keep your filth out of the millions who start their day with Ganesh's holy name.
1,this book serves no purpose,"it seems that the author has deliberatelychosen to hurt the sentiments of a community.this book is of no value in terms ofacademic contribution. people have a rightto react and criticize the book in any manner.On one hand Thomas P. Fortune is talking aboutthe right of Free speech, but onthe other hand is is telling the other personto ""go back to the subcontinent"". Fine ! Let'sall go back to wherever we came from. And let'sleave this continent to the native americans.Game for it ?"
1,Distasteful,"This is one of the worst depiction of Hindu culture. This book ought to be banned. I know that we all have freedom of speech, but this is pushing it too far !!!"
1,What a cheap crap!!,Its a horrendous act of writing books which hurts the feelings & beliefs of billions of people accross the world. People should not tolerate this. No one has any right to crack jokes or comment on other people's religion. This has a direct effect on people's beliefs on CULTURE (specially people of Indian origin/Foreign nationality). Raise a tough voice to act against the book before its too late. I had to select 1 star cause there was no 0 STAR option!!
1,JOke,This CD is Aight But hes no daddy yankee with that said this dude needs some fashion Tips BADLY hehe!
4,johnny p. got flow,"it has all the style in the reaggaeton genre,it has some good beats johnny prez has a good album out so purchase it you wont regret it.prez has improve so much,he lyrics are more tighter.i will give it a month and it will be on the top ten.well until CHEKA comes out with his album. out in may get it,so far it has great reviews..."
4,Bargain-priced bonanza,"For anyone who loves western music, the Sons of the Pioneers are essential listening, and this collection of 4 CD's provides 100 beautifully reproduced studio recordings from the 1930s through the 1950s. There are earlier and later versions of ""Cool Water,"" ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds,"" and ""Chant of the Wanderer,"" plus such gems as ""Hills of Old Wyoming,"" ""Timber Trail,"" ""Out California Way,"" ""The Last Roundup,"" ""River of No Return,"" and ""Montana."" My only complaints are that the enclosed 50-page booklet is riddled with errors and omissions and that the selections include some dross and omit such classics as ""Wagon Wheels,"" ""Love Song of the Waterfall,"" and ""Along the Navajo Trail."""
4,My Saddle Pals and I,Great songs and good quality - I recommend this to anyone who likes the Sons of the Pioneers
1,something doesn't quite smell right,"very faint. seems to last about 30 minutes. smells ""watered down"" - the correct scent is there (I have purchased previously from Macy's) just fractional.not impressed. would not recommend."
1,Pass on this offer,These look nice but did not fit well nor did they make it through one wash - keep looking...
1,"I tried to like it, I really did...","I was so excited about this book. I absolutely adored Alice in Bed, I figured, 'Great, the saga continues'! But, no it didn't continue, it stopped dead. What happened to Schine's entertaining sarcasm and wit? It's replaced with a sloppy writing style and silly pages containing lists of birds! I could barely read this book. I kept wondering where the Alice that I fell in love with went. Louis was an annoying yet endearing character in the first installment, but now he seems to be bordering on some benign lunacy! I didn't like anyone anymore! A very big disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"If you want good social comedy, my advice is to read Elinor Lipman instead. This book is slow and aimless. Louie is so repugnant that words fail. And what's up with the bird lists? Elinor has never failed me."
3,Great Picture BUT...,"I bought this product for my kids (road trips) as well as the large screen. The picture is wonderful but the battery life is horrible. Additionally, I cannot seem to find a car adapter to work with this product... Bottom line, make sure you ABSOLUTELY charge this item fully before taking it any place where there is not an AC adapter. I would have given this unit four stars if I could find something to make it more road-compatable."
1,"""Like New"" - think again.","You can hear the motor running while playing the DVD, which is annoying, unless you use headphones. Also the battery life stinks. I bought this specifically for it's known battery life and was very disappointing. The battery life is from 30 min to 1 hr. There are no replacement batteries. However, Best Buy has a universal battery for $54, but I'm learning they can vary from 1 hr to 4 hr - - so be aware of false claims. Basically, I was ripped off buying a used DVD player. I called they guy and his response was, oh, sorry for your trouble! Watch out for dishonest people making claims ""like new""."
5,A Horse for Danny,"This was a wonderful movie. It is definitely one I would recommend for families. I appreciate movies that don't encourage the use of vulgarity. I will watch it again and again alone and with friends, that's how much I like it."
5,Classic Robert Uric Movie,Great movie. Beautiful horse and cinematography. Robert Uric plays his part well and makes the story lifelike. Everyone can identify with the little girls plight.
2,A horse for Danny,"Not impressed, bought for my granddaughter. I also bought Flicka, my granddaughter was very impressed with that movie."
4,M.Joseph,"Mary Monroe's powerful voice speaks volumes to her audience. She gets into the hearts and souls of her readers by creating characters that they can relate to.Gonna Lay Down My Burdens is a novel about deception, lonliness and guilt. As the main character Carmen, determined to make amends for her cruel acts spends most of her adult life feeling obligated to a man for the pain that she caused him during their childhood. She promises herself to this man, whom she doesn't love because of her guilt. Carmen started on a journey that wasn't her own but a surprising twist of faith leads her to her true love.This book speaks of love and lost and it will take you on a journey that will leave you feelinf fulfilled."
4,GOOD! GOOD! GOOD!,"I realy enjoyed reading this book, and loved just how many turns the book took. Carmen's character was the face of so many young African American girls and women today. She carried so many secrets and so much on her shoulders that she never really got the chance to be Carmen. This book is a great read along with ""God Don't Like Ugly"". I must admit this author has a talent for writing and making her readers involve themselves in her characters. This book gets a thumbs up from me! Can't wait until the next one. Best of luck Mary Monroe!!!"
2,gonna lay down my burdens,The book isn't keeping my attention. It's boring. So boring that I stopped reading it and I like to read.
4,Very Interesting,I do recommend anyone to read this book. I have bought 2 more of Mary Monroe's books and have enjoyed them as well.
3,WASN'T FEELING THIS NOVEL,This is a quick read. It started off exciting and soon became boring. It's filled with day-to-day activities and lies between very good friends. Carmen's guilt trip over Burl was way over the top. The novel ended just as I expected...much about nothing in the end between Carmen and Chester. The only reason I read the entire book was because Mary Monroe's books are usually pretty good and I have all of them. I have pre-ordered Red Light Wives. The title seems interesting and juicy.
5,Everyone's Keeper,"Carmen Taylor has her own worries and problems, but she is too busy shouldering everyone else's problems to handle her own. As a teenager, Carmen often pulled pranks and got into trouble with several tragic events occuring during this time. These events later play a key role throughout most of her adult life.Chester Sheffield has always been the man that Carmen has coveted, but her sense of obligation and guilt may cause her to miss out on her one true love. Mary Monroe's Gonna Lay Down My Burdens is a deeply emotional book and is a good example of what guilt can do to a person and those around them. This is a beautifully written book and is on my top ten list for 2002.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks"
2,No where as good as the other books,"I had told a friend about two books I read by this author that I had liked and she gave me this book. I was excited to read it but was thoroughly disappointed. It was nothing in comparison to The Upper Room and God Don't Like Ugly. This one was written more immaturely. I don't know the order of which book came out first, but Gonna Lay Down My Burdens was a very, very, very slow read and dare I say . . . boring. It was also highly predictable. I'm not sure if I want to take a chance on reading the other books if the pace is as slow as this one. I really couldn't picture the characters in my head like I could the other two books. I guess it goes to show that everything you write will not turn to gold (unless you're Terry McMillan)."
4,Excellent Story--Dragged Out Though,"This was a really good story and humerous in parts. I enjoyed it, and I do recommend this book to other adults to read. The last part of the book was excellent. However, it was dragged way too far out. The same story could have easily been told by taking out about 1/4 of the book. There are 70 chapters in this book! YES--70!"
4,WHAT A GREAT BOOK,I ENJOY THIS BOOK VERY MUCH. IT WAS SO GOOD. I DIDNT THINK I WOULD LIKE THIS BOOK. BECAUSE HER SECOND BOOK I DIDNT CARE FOR BECAUSE I DIDNT LIKE WHAT THE BOOK WAS ABOUT. THIS BOOK WAS SOOOOOOOO GOOOD.
3,Great Book!,Started out exciting but majority of the book was about the character's childhood. I think that the end could have been better because i wanted to know what was going to happen next. Carmen is a very good friend they dont make friends like that who put her life on hold for others! Chester is a man with issues since childhood but he turned out cool he need to work on some things though. But overall the book was good it was a page turner towards the middle of the book.
2,Not her best work,"I don't usually write reviews but I had to for this book.The first chapter was the best,it drew you in but after reading more it left you disappointed.There were so many different twists and turns and this book just didnt do it for me.I honestly only kept reading the book because I paid for it.I bought it for $2.97 from Walmart and honestly I'm glad that's all I paid for it."
5,"Chilling story, but nevertheless Brilliant","The main character tells his daughter who lies in a coma his story. The story of his most intimate feelings towards different people. Obvious his love for his daughter and his fear she might die. The fact that over the years the love towards her mother has gone. And most of all its the story of the obscure relationship for an unknown woman he picked up somewhere, and the graphic account of the raw sex he has with her.And after a while there is a change in the horrifyingly selfish abuse of the main character towards this unknown woman.This book is chilling, tender and loving at the same time.It has in the meantime been travelling my circle of friends. Each and everyone finds it overwhelming. This is a must read for sure."
4,Read it With Your Kids!,"This is a can't-miss piece of literature for anyone (especially girls!). I highly recommend reading the entire series. I have a very special memory of my mother reading the series to me when I was a young girl. We laughed, we cried, and we bonded. Please give this to your little girl, or if she is too young, read it to her. Not only will you bond with her, you'll heighten her love for reading."
2,Romantic classics,"These books are timeless classics in my opinion. Anne of Green Gables is a heartwarming character, and her outlook on life is so positive and uplifting, that you can't help but feel good reading them. LM Montgomery's writing style is very astute, descriptive and romantic. Great reading for all ages. And I messed up the rating, it should have FIVE STARS!!"
5,The best book I have ever read in my life!!!!!,"The book Anne of Green Gables is a great book for all ages. Although it is a bit lengthy, there is ALWAYS something happening on each page. If you take the time to read it, this is really a worthwhile book. The story is about a young orphan girl who is accidentally adopted by the Culberts, who had wanted a boy instead of a girl . Anne gets into all sorts of trouble soon, like jumping onto beds, (with people sleeping in them) and dying her hair green! Although Anne was an ""accident"", the Culberts would never forget life without her. If you are an adventure-loving person, you should definitely read this book!"
5,Anne of Green Gables- A great book,"Anne of Green Gables is a wonderful book and is very exciting. I recromend this book to anyone. The reading level is very challenging, and is a great classic. If you ever have to do essays on books of certain subjects, I totally recromend Anne of Green Gables as a classic. I have read all of the Anne books and I loved them all."
5,I Really Enjoyed This Book,Anne of Green Gables is a book about a spunky red head (Anne) who gets adopted by Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. Anne spent her childhood at Green Gables where she had many adventures. Anne was my favorite character because she had a terrible temper and a vivid imagination. I think this book is mainly for middle-school students because when Anne got adopted she was in middle school and the book focused mainly on around the time she got adopted. Anywhere Anne goes she uses her imagination to make it beautiful. The author's style is great because the book was exciting and stayed on topic. I really enjoyed this book and I know you will too.
4,Just Plain Good Books,"This is a wonderful series, yes it's a little old fashioned but it's just good. Who couldn't love Anne, with an E?"
5,"Touching,Funny and VERYYYY Entertaining!!!","I read a lot.. an average of 4-5 books a week.When a freind told me about this book ... i was quite baffled...i'm into classics... but i had read 'Kilmeny of the orchard' before and had not like it. So i took 'Anne of green gables' very reluctantly.An hour later i could'nt put it down and wanted to read all the titles.I became an instant fan of LM.Montgomery.Anne is really enchanting, with an excellent imagination and a kind heart with a quick temper. it's the best recipe for a book in a cosy bed.It gives a modern classical feel.Its written really well...and all the characters are really well drawn...Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert , Diana, Mrs. Lynde and ( Gilbert)If you like to read claasics as well as contempory books .. i 'll advise u to read this."
5,I LUV THIS NOVEL!,Well I started reading this when I was hmm... about eleven (the age Anne was in the books!) and now that I am 12 I still luv them as much as ever!. I luved the books they were about the best books I have ever read. The stories actually brought me to hmm.... where? PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND!!! To see the real GREEN GABLES! The book some parts of it was insipid but the movie with Megan Follows was excelent!!!!
4,The Anne books are a wonderfully written books.,"The Anne of Green Gables series is a inspiring tale of a young girl growing up. She's goes through good and bad, sadness and great happiness. She finds true love and is torn away from it. She has six children and in Rainbow Valley we get a closer look in thier lives. I would recommend this book to anyone. My personal favorite though was Anne of Green Gables."
3,Nice set,"I am mostly happy with this boxed set. There have been a few lines throughout the series that were almost to light to read, but overall, a good set at a good price."
3,Box set of Anne of Green Cables,"Nicely presented box set. It was purchased as a gift for my 7 year old daughter, but the books are best suited to teenagers. Writing is small and no pictures."
3,I love books,"I'm 61 yrs. old and have never read these books, a friend recommended them so I went Amazon & found them. Was nice to find the whole set. Was a bit disappointed in the condition, they are definitely readable, but not as good as stated."
5,Wonderful series.,Our grandchildren even enjoy this series. They are 8 and 11 and ask to watch when they come for sleepovers.
5,Love Anne of Green Gables!!,"Anne of Green Gables is a classic book, which is interesting, fun, informative and educational. Montgomary not only takes you into Anne's world with beautiful ease but within this world the reader gets a great insight into life in general, since we watch Anne making many mistakes, but also not giving up and living each day to the full!This product is great as the books were sent in great condition, but also it allows to have the whole set for a very cheap price!!I highly recommend this product!"
5,Sharing the Fun of Reading,"I read these books as a child and purchased this set to share with my grand children. I don't know if these books are a hit yet because my two older ones (ages 11 and 10) have been reading the Vampire books that are so popular. My 7 year old hasn't tried them yet. However, my 21 year old grand daughter loves them just like I do. Time will tell about the younger ones."
2,Anne of Green Gables Boxes Set,"I'm a big fan of the classics and was happy to order this set for my neice for her birthday. I was terribly embarrassed however, when she opened the set the box holding the books came completely apart! I think a boxed set of books (even paper back) should be framed in materials more solid than heavey construction paper. Next time I'll order hard back and avoid the humiliation."
1,For Those Interested,"For those reading this who are interested in what the Bible says, I address this to you. The Anne of Green Gables series contains some very unGodly things, and the author was into witchcraft and the occult. I was an Anne fan for nearly four years (worshipped her and the author), and God saved me out of that almost two years ago. Anyone who seeks further information concerning Anne Shirley or Lucy Maud Montgomery, please go to the Keepers of the Faith website, and go to ""articles/book reviews"" - there you will find my personal testimony, and a wonderful article on Author Lucy Maud Montgomery.Thank you, and May God Bless you!-A Former Anne Fan and 17 year old conservative Christian young lady"
1,Yawn,"I was forced to read this against my own will.This book was boring,and not at all exciting.It was kind of predictable,and if you like thrillers,this isn't the book for you.If you want to fall asleep,read this one and you'll have no trouble falling asleep."
5,Good stuff,My wife grew up with these timeless classics and she really enjoys the series. It is really nice to have the whole complete series together to add to our library.
5,Luminous!!!,"I have read all the books about Anne in Polish, but I am positive that their charm transcends languages. They were my favorite childhood books and are still among the books to which I come back on rainy days (and I'm 22). They all are absolutely wonderful. The characters portrayed in the have become a part of my vernacular, I love them as I would love close friends and I worry about them as I read the books (even knowing the outcome, of course). I am also in the habit of re-reading my favorite chapters from the books about Anne. Read them, they will completely enchant you! (If you have already read the Anne series, try The Blue Castle, it is absolutely wonderful!)"
2,type is tiny!!!,"This a great price for a great series of books but it has a major problem. The type is so tiny, it's hard to read. I bought these books for my 8 year old and it's really a strain on her eyes to read them for long periods of time."
5,Pefrect for a pre-teen girl,"My daughter and I had watched all the Anne of Green Gables movies with Colleen Durhurst, and loved them. So I got her the first movie and the first book. When I saw the complete set I knew she would love it, and she has. Somethign about the spirit of this little girl is amazing for young girls to read about. And it helps that Anne is a girl who is smart and funny, who takes her family and her obligations very seriously. Something that can be lacking in our youth today, is present in the pages of these books."
4,good,I have only read Anna of green Gables and I found it very enjoyable though after all the hype about it I mush say I felt it fell a bit short of the mark. But I still think that people should read it if not for pleasure then for the simple fact that it holds such a large place in Canadian Childrens Fiction.
5,Christmas gift,"I bought this set of books for my 10 year old granddaughter because she had read Anne of Green Gables and loved it. She was so excited when she opened the set, and has already read four of the books!"
5,Perfect!,"My sister-in-law was looking for these to read with her two girls, so I got them for her as a birthday present. Great books, great literature, great price too--perfect combination. They're not heirloom quality, needless to say, but the girls won't need to worry about curling up on the couch with them either. A series of books (or even better, films!) that no girls (or even boys!) should grow up without."
5,Perfect gift!,LOVE IT!!! This was perfect just like the photo. I am very happy with this product! Please keep up the good work! Very satisfied! Thank you!
4,good books...bad box,"I love the Anne of Green Gables book series and I was looking forward to having my own box set of the books but when I recieved the books I was dissapointed with the box which held the books. Unlike the traditional card board boxes, this was very flimsey and would fall apart very easily."
5,I loved it!,"These were some of my favorite books growing up, and now I own the complete set! At a very reasonable price, too!"
4,Fabulous book!,"I first picked up this book at the library. After getting a fourth of the way through, I knew I needed to buy it. This book has helped me so much with my writing- not only technique wise, but helped with creative ideas as well. It's not just a boring how-to guide either. Smith uses humor to get his points across. I also love the focus on writing to get published. To often books leave this important aspect out. Every fiction writer should have this book."
2,Depends On Your Objective,"If you want to write using a formula, get Smith's previous book, You Can Write A Novel. It is much better. Also, if you are interested in creative writing, keep in mind that many of the most popular works of fiction offer a unique approach whose DIFFERENCES appealed to readers. Too many people are looking for trends, when they would be better served by looking inward and going with their own instincts."
2,Disappointing.,"Looking for suggestions on creativity and getting started wtih the basics of writing I ordered this book. After the first 50 or so pages I didn't even finish it. I found it formulaic and while some of the ideas were quite interesting I didn't find it nearly as helpful as Steven King's ""On Writing""."
2,netting separated,"My 75# son used it twice, last evening the netting began separating from the base while he was in it. Looks like it can be fixed but shouldn't have to."
3,Camo Jungle Hammock,I wanted a hammock that would be heavier for winter camping. The canvas bottom fits that requirement. It's a good little hammock. I plan on using a tarp with it in the future. For the price here on Amazon it's a good little hammock.
4,"Great hamock, dont expect to stay dry.","the hammocks great,but the rain cover is worthless.also keeps bugs out well.so far its as durable as you could want, its defiantly quality stuff just don't rely on it for total rain coverage.a bit of a puzzle to get the rain fly part up as well."
1,JUNK,"I own a Hennessy Hammock, the best out there in my opinion. I tried this because it is cheaper, Terrible mistake. It's hard to set up because you need to tie to multiple trees. It's not stable and as soon as I layed down it ripped and now worthless. Don't waste your money and don't skimp on buying camping equipment."
3,Ehh Salright,"So I bought this cause I was gonna do a little hiking, and I thought that it would be good for the hike. I will say that it works. It is a little heavy for hiking, and it is not super comfortable to sleep in. However, I think it has some positives. The rain fly couldn't stop a real downpour, but I did sleep through some rains that friends of mine had to wake up for. The mosquito net works, although one night I think it trapped several in the hammock with me. If you are hiking, and trying to keep pack weight low go with something else. If you are looking for ease of set up look elsewhere. If you are looking for something that holds up O.K. for not a lot of money, this might be for you. I actually really like mine. There is something about it that feels a little like home."
1,Not as advertised,"I ordered this item advertised as a BLACK DOUBLE NUT THRU HULL FITTING. It was shipped to me as a WHITE SINGLE NUT FITTING. When I emailed back the error, the response I got back was ""COULD I MAKE IT WORK""? Obviously I could MAKE it work, but it is not what I ordered and it was not what I wanted. I went elsewhere to get what I wanted. It put me two weeks behind in my project."
2,not for welding use,"These gloves should not be used for welding. I was using them for Tig welding and within an hour of use they already had holes in them from indirect heat from the welding surfaces. They are not entirely made of leather so the synthetic material melts very quickly so within the first hour I have about 4 small to moderate sized holes in one of my gloves with out ever touching the hot metal surface, and I was only welding on 80 amps so I wasn't pushing the limits of Tig welding by any means. These gloves would work fine for general purpose work gloves and even provide some mild heat protection but will not work for any welding application."
3,okay info,"Although the info in this document is good, you can save yourself the money and Google ""bond referendum"" and get the same information for FREE!!!"
5,Good Value,This caddy is plastic coated so it won't rust. It doesn't look as good as chrome but it's definitely more practical. The seller is really good with communication and ships fast.
3,Rather large,"This is not designed very well.Except for the top shelf, the others would not hold regular size bottles of shampoo, conditioner or liquid cleanser.So pretty much all I have on it are soap and a razor. Everything else is sitting on the floor of the shower."
2,Not very good,I bought this unit because a friend said his cools his small house. It struggled to cools my kitchen/dinning room. After two years it only blows hot air. I paid good money for this item and never liked it.
1,don't buy it!,Within a day I scratched the lens. Within a week the black powder coat had rubbed off. Terrible product.
3,decent for $8,It fit the wheel great but the strings to tie the laces together and the overall apperence wasn't the greatest.
4,looks good in my ride,I have a classic chevy and the steering wheel was in pretty bad shape. The Grip took care of that problem and it feels good on the hands. I totally recommend it.
3,IndieReader Review,Past Imperfect is a memoir written by a man whose life nearly spans iconic eras in American history-from his youth during World War II and his Army service during the Kennedy era to his coming of age during Vietnam and his tenure as an English teacher (and father) during the 70s and 80s.An fun and interesting read puncuated interesting and extensive descriptions of overseas cultures.Reviewed by IR Staff
5,=),While the color itself isn't that interesting - duh - the belly ring was of good quality. BodyCandy sells very nice and inexpensive products.
4,Interesting but not profound,"Composed in memory of a Lithuanian nationalist for chamber orchestra, mezzo-soprano and chorus this Requiem contains the traditional words for masses of the dead. Naxos as usual has adroit notes that explain this composer of whom I have never heard. The whole ensemble shine but especially mezzo Leitale who sings each verse with the choir. The piece seems to be written in the simplifying sytle of Part but unlike his works I double we be listening to it in years to come"
5,Great book,"I liked the book, it was a good help designing workouts. I do have to say though, that the swim workouts were a bit corny-this comes from someone who swam NCAA div. I in college. I mean COME ON, nose plugs? Blow bubbles for crying out loud. Other than that brief passage, I was rather impressed. On the other hand, we did get a hearty chuckle over it at the pool, so you could say this book is humorous too."
3,Waterway Iron Might Pump,This is the third waterway iron might pump that I have had on my hot tub over the past 6 years. They begin making a high pitch sound for a few minutes then the sound will go away. This is the first sign that the pumps life is about to end. I just ordered a new one once again from ELECTRIC MOTOR WAREHOUSE. The pump failed at the very start. I contaced ELECTRIC MOTOR WAREHOUSE and explained what took place. They sent out a new one to me that very day. They are a outstanding company in my view. I wish other companys would respond as quick.Waterway Iron Might Pond Pump 115 Volt # 3410030-1E
1,Seemed quite biased,I thought the author didn't seem to have very coherent arguments or presentations of facts. He also seemed to downplay the role of the church cover up of priests molesting children (something anyone else goes to prison for) and instead focused on nitpicking media coverage for showing a feminist/childist bias all the while seeming to show a very Conservative Christian bias - which isn't surprising after reading his wikipedia page.
2,Prosaic....,"Personally I found this book to be little more than a GRE verbal refresher course. Sure, it is objective and balanced but so impassionate that such a contentious issue seems like nothing. I think you can strip away emotion from a social problem so much that it creates the question of, well, then, does this really matter? In my opinion I feel this is what the author has done. I was really disappointed in this book."
4,Solid Social Science,"Professor Jenkins contributes immeasurably to the current discussion of clergy sexual abuse by doing what every social scientist should. Jenkins steadfastly refuses to add to the volume of this shrill and partisan debate by offering conjectures or personal opinions. Instead, he calmly presents the data in a detached manner, and then draws his conclusions based solely on the data.Anyone with an interest in the current crisis would benefit from reading Professor Jenkins' sane, calm, and lucid analysis."
2,Deeply Biased Author Makes Excuses for Pedophiles and Those who Shelter Them,"I thought this book was going to be about priests who molested children, but instead, it is about the way the public looks at the priest sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. I felt that the author made excuses for the Catholic Church, claiming that there responses to the victims were justifiable and that any other institution would have acted the same way. These excuses were intended to make the Catholic Church seem less guilty than it is. The author also minimizes the impact of abuse on children and emphasizes that many of the children were older such as in their teens. The author does not seem to consider abuse of children in their teens to be all that serious. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I felt that this author was clearly biased and was trying to make the Catholic Church out to be a victim."
5,perfect for passport,"Perfect for passport..Nothing fancy, just two slots that can carry a passport and somecard inserts for credit cards..No tasteless plastic window virtually all other similar products have.."
3,Passport wallet,"The seller was kind enough to allow me to change this passport wallet, which is fine but the fit is too tight and it doesn't fit some non-US passports, for another one that does."
1,passport holder,"I am very unhappy with this passport holder. It is too small to fit the American passport. I would like to return it, but do not have the receipt or the address. Can you help me? Sandra A Doron"
5,the felines of the universe,"This wonderful book was loaned to me when my own much loved cat was sadly killed in a horrific way. On opening this book I could not put it down, the information in it being channelled by the Paschats is wonderful the race of The lion People helped me to come to terms with what had passed and I feel their precense where ever I go. Murray Hope told their story brilliantly and anyone who likes felines will love this book."
2,For Novices,"The book was disappointing for me. It had no energy in the words or message. One or two points it makes are interesting and would be ideal for someone who is new to channeled messages such as this. The main thrust of the book is about Inner and Outer time and how our relationship to our lives lived in time as we know is affected by Outer Time or the place of unification of cosmic existence. Not bad, really. but it had less to do with the Lion People that what I might have expected from the title!"
3,Deadline,"Following her jailed father's apparent suicide, Tess Abbott becomes unsure that his conviction for murdering her mother was justified. Could he have been innocent, and might his death be a second murder? Her unanswered questions take her back to her home town where she meets Spencer Reed, a reporter as dedicated to truth as she herself is. Together, they unearth a past filled with secrets and lies that could explode all over the current political scene.The ending is guaranteed to shock and surprise you, and with such a fast paced novel, you will reach that end soon. This is a rewarding read for the true mystery fan.Amanda Killgore"
1,Beyers Horses,Too expensive. Fragile. Not a toy. Read the description on the box for horse background. Good for a collector not good for young children.
1,Only 20-30 rewrites before failure! Caveat emptor!,I concur with another reviewer here. I purchased 6 of these about a year ago and only two remain usable. The rest all failed between 20-30 rewrites. (The remaining functional disks currently have 24 and 25 rewrites respectively) Not worth the high price!
3,recommended for the advanced student; but not a beginner,"I enjoyed this book about the wiccan philosophy of Amber Laine Fischer. This is a good book if you are looking to expand your understanding of a religion that is very personal to its practitioners. I would not recommend this book to a brand new neophyte however. I would only recommend this book to someone who has been on the pagan path for some time now, not someone without enough information to distinguish which parts are Ms. Fischers's personal beliefs and which are more or less core beliefs of wicca. It's got some very good ideas but the reader must always remember that this book is the author's version of spiritual practice. The ideas may or may not be right for the individual reader. Recommended for more those who are more advanced in their religious studies but not for the beginner."
5,This book will get you thinking!,"I cannot recommend this book enough. 'Philosophy of Wicca' deeply resonated with me. It made me ponder, it gave me ideas, it cemented reasonings and from it I got to the core of me. Chapters of note are ""The Wiccan Rede and the Magician's Manifesto"" and ""Magic and Witchcraft"". Years after my original purchase, I still have half a dozen little 'sticky notes' plastered over pages I want to return to to ponder. This is truly a must-read book."
3,Straightforward guidance,"I really appreciated the simplicity of the author's approach here. Ambivalence is hard to handle, but this book made it so much easier. The simple premise is that if you respond to a particular question in a particular way then you have your answer: either 'go' or 'stay'. There really are some things in a relationship that mean it is doomed and the anecdotes support this. It also helps the reader to not feel quite so alone and isolated. The second-guessing can stop and people who read this book can move forward directly and with more confidence."
5,"Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay","This is a fabulous book and I highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling with relationship issues (and who isn't?). Unlike the typical self-help books, this book doesn't pretend to have some new formula invented by the author. She simply reports in a very insightful way: people who said they left for this reason were glad; people who said they left for that reason were not, etc. She doesn't tell you to add up the pros and cons, but rather gives you many specific directed questions to ask yourself to bring you to your own best decision. The author has a great writing style as well."
4,You still need to act after deciding,"A very helpful book although the answer one will find might not be as obvious as the author makes you believe it will be. There are many helpful hints such as to avoid putting together pros and cons lists ? they will not help you solve your relationship ambivalence, they will just intensify your emotional roller coaster ride. The examples in the book often seem too extreme, which might lead one to think that one actually has a perfect relationship compared to some of the examples. Therefore the reader needs to adjust the example to his/her own situation. Nevertheless it is a very helpful guideline to help you make one of the most important decisions in your life. But you should be aware that it might also be along way from deciding what is right for you to do to actually acting upon your decision, which is the only way to actually get out of the most unpleasant ambivalence situation and find happiness again."
5,Life Changing Book,"This book helped me make the decision I knew I needed to make. What it gave me was clarity. And now, over a year after I finally had the courage to leave my husband, I know I truly made the right decision. It has some excellent valid points. A good book for anyone in a relationship or contemplating one. I know just reading this book will help me in my next relationship or choosing a life partner. I have read many self-help and relationship books, but this one is very practical and to the point."
2,Even more confused,"I did not like this book. I tried to read it twice. The first time I didn't like it because it seemed to tell me I was ambivalent because I WANTED to be (like I need any more guilt). The second time I read it, I ended up even more unsure than when I started. It brought up a bunch more stuff to think about that I hadn't even considered--which as I said, left me even more confused. Maybe it can be helpful for some people, but it was not helpful to me."
3,False Positive,"The false positive that can result from reading this book can damage lives. However, it is very well written and easy to read."
2,Not useful to me,This book was too full of generalities and things that if you are in this situation you have already considered and weighed out for yourself. It did not help at all.
3,stressed relationship,This is a good book if you have major problems in your relationship and you have thoughts about leaving. Not good for minor problems.
4,Too Good to Leave Too Good to Stay,I like the book so far. It has a lot of good information in it and makes a lot of sense.
4,Too Good to Leave; Too Bad to Stay,This is a great book with great talking points for you and your spouse. The questions prompt you to face things that you may want to sweep under the rug as well as validate others.
1,Justify Leaving this is for you!,"If you read the multi star reviews of this book, the readers are thrilled to have a book validate their reasons for leaving. No one read it and said ""Yes, I reclaimed my commitment to my partner and marriage. The book focuses on evaluating your misery and what you aren't getting out of the relationship and makes no attempt to address the reader's role in the quality of their relationship. The state of one's relationship is a mutual dysfunction; looking to leave rather than reclaim your love this is a check list that dooms any relationship in peril. Even the final chapter starts with If you've now decide to leave, it is so weighted towards divorcing, if that is what you want and not to feel guilty and blame your partner... buy it now, it will be the tool you need to leave. Easier then personal growth and taking some responsibility of you get out what you put in."
5,Exactly what I needed......,"Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay: A Step-by-Step Guide to Help You Decide Whether to Stay In or Get Out of Your RelationshipI just finished reading this book. Wow. I have been in relationship ambivalence for the last year in an almost 30-year marriage. I am so grateful to the author for delineating marriage issues so succinctly. This book clarified so many issues and reinforced in me that I must not feel bad for wanting my own emotional needs met. Between this and a great therapist, I am finally becoming true to myself. Whichever way the marriage goes, I'll have a firm grasp on what went wrong and will be able to make the right decision for myself. The perspectives shared in this book could only have been garnered after working with many couples. I'm so glad the author shared with us."
5,A Must Read- even if it crosses your mind once!,"Great book, helped me a lot through a struggling time I went through with someone. It helped me in making my own decision, and the best possible one (to leave that person).So thank you.Great read. my copy was destroyed by water but I will soon be replacing it 'cause it's that good!"
1,Scary advice in our self- centered divorce prone culture.,"Mira Kirshenbaum's advice seems to lean toward leaving a marriage if you are ""unhappy"" with your spouse. It's a very ""what's happenin now"" book. I personally don't even believe her results. I think that people lie about their happiness quotient because they want to justify their decisions......Not very deep and the people that were used as examples were not interesting to me.According to Ms Kirshenbaums questionaire, I would be happier if I left my marriage. Really? If I did that, then how would my children learn about real Love and forgiveness, and hope and change?"
3,Slow Read...,"The book drags a bit and nothing really grasps my attention to want to keep reading. Everytime you think you are about to get some advice you get ""as you continue to read this book you will hear my advice for this type of situation""...so you continue to read but that advice never really comes?? I don't know...still reading. If you are looking for a self help book I guess its not so bad."
1,Enough to make any woman want to leave a good man,If you would like your wife to leave you just buy her this book. It offers a no guilt justification of breaking a family just because life isn't a fairy tale. A twisted book from an obvious feminist author.
1,,I didn't really care for the book b/c I felt it was very mixed opinions and way way to many examples!
5,"If you are in between, it's a MUST read!","It's important to be truthful, honest and look at your future from a clear lens. This book provides the opportunity to look at your relationships from a realistic point of view. There are no suggestions, only facts which allow you to make your own decisions. The author has mastered the art of helping readers decide what is best for them and living with the consequences either way."
4,Good information even if there are no mariatial problems,"The information in this book was very informative and will apply to anyone in an ill fated marriage or not. Did not like the way she kept referring to ""She"". Sometimes it was distracting. It covered most everything anyone wants to know that may be confused looking for some kind of an answer but yet informative enough to be read by a marriage that looks good. I read the whole book in about 10.5 hrs and will read it again, after I pass it to my soon to be ex-wife. Not that this book made my decision but helped me answer a few lost questions."
2,Beware: Reading this book is likely to end your marriage,"I am a clinical psychologist and I work with couples on the brink of divorce. It seems to me that anyone whose marriage is in enough trouble to be reading this book will end up divorced if she (usually women reading these types of books.) follows Kirshenbaum's guidelines.Better books are The Divorce Remedy by Weiner-Davis or either Should I Stay?If you want justification for leaving, this book will gift it to you."
5,"Well-written, with clear explanations","This book is a must-read for anyone in that ambiguous zone between leaving or staying in a relationship. It is also good for recognizing issues in all kinds of relationships, since power struggles, communication issues, and the like, infect all types of interactions with others. This book cleared my thinking and brought real enlightenment to my marriage, as well as my relationship with my mother. The author is balanced in addressing staying or leaving, and she clearly has a lot of experience with couples' therapy. She is an excellent writer; using clear, pertinent examples to illustrate her points."
5,A Great Tool,"The author does a great job of talking to the reader in a no-nonsense way about relationship ambivalance, which is something that many of us go through at least once in our lifetimes. It's a fantastic tool to help you examine how you feel about your relationship and if most people who feel the way you do were happier staying or leaving. I found this book to be extremely helpful--I had already made my decision before I read it, but it gave me reassurance that I made the best choice for me. It just reiterated what I already knew, but it was good to hear it from another source. If you are debating leaving a long-term relationship or marriage, buy this book. I have 5 friends that I am FORCING to read it just so they can get out of the state of ambivalence which helps no one. I know this book will help them in one way or another. Good luck..."
5,This book is a real eye-opener.,"At times I felt I was reading my own life story, but the best part about this book is that you can not read it and in the end NOT have made a decision to either end or stay in your current relationship. I made my decision, and there were only a few written exercises to do. Ms. Kirshenbaum tells it like it is, I like her writing style, and I have ordered all her other books. I'm also going to look over her recommended reading list and order from there too. How did this very smart lady pass me, queen of the self-help book land, by? I am glad I found this author"
4,An un-biased and realistic look at relationships,"What I admire the most about this book is that it is one of the few books on relationships I have seen that doesn't try to pigeon-hole people into groups, or take sides, or give only one answer. Mira Kirshenbaum is a very fair and well-informed person, and she counsels, suggests, and advises, rather than trying to give clear-cut answers to the myriad of problems that arise in relationships. The reader is encouraged to list the good and bad aspects of their particular situation, to discuss, to work on it. The key to the success of a relationship, or to possibly salvaging one of the brink, is to work and communicate. That is the bulk of Kirshenbaum's words, and after reading this book I certainly felt that I had been given helpful advice, and that there indeed was light at the end of the tunnel. If you are having troubles in your relationship, this is one of the first books you should read."
3,Too Good to Leave,"The book makes people think about what matters in a relationship and considers different angles. However, some of the examples in the book seemed a bit extreme to me. Some problems in some relationships are not as obvious and it is harder to define what really is wrong. This is not addressed in this book. It seems like this book is for people in relationships with obvious problems."
3,"Good book, but wished it said more about staying and/or leaving's effect on children","This book was very well written. I read it in a evening!BUT I sincerely wished that the author would have talked more about the effect of staying or leaving on the couple's children. Staying together or separating is a family issue, and all perspectives and practical matters should be considered before deciding on the future of one's relationship. Additionally, ambivalence about the relationship has it's effect on family functioning.My partner ended up leaving. He got 2/3 through the book, but I read it 3 times! He was also unwilling to work on the issue in therapy, which the author advises strongly. I feel confident that I did everything in my power to understand his perspective, and this book helped me in that respect, but I feel he lacked insight into how his actions effect our children. I wish somewhere along the way that this could have been impressed upon him more strongly."
1,Terrible book,"This book should be re-titled ""100 Reasons to Leave Someone"". Every question ends in ""if you answered this way, then you would be happier without them."" It seems that if they were truly trying to help someone make a leveled decision that they should provide at least some reason why people should stay, but it becomes only a slight afterthought in the book."
4,JUSTICE IN A CONNECTICUT COURTROOM,"This concise but interesting book is an excellent biography of a courageous and gifted Black woman in post-Colonial times. With self-composure she fought for her freedom--not using violence--but working within the Law, in a Connecticut courtroom.Consisting of an introduction and 15 short chapters, this modest volume depicts her focused struggle to enjoy the liberty which the Colonists had recently bought so dearly. In her pursuit of justice she earns the respect of her lawyer and second master/employer. She performs all household duties with skill and integrity: nurse, housekeeper, even defender of the hearth during the master's absence. Mumbet pursues her dream of freedom 35 years before the Emancipation Proclamation, and achieves it legally, with great dignity. I had never heard of this courageous woman, I am ashamed to confess, so this little book is a great read for young students of Black History as well as anyone into Women's Studies."
1,This book turned me off databases forever,"This book claims to be for beginners, but it is not. The author's style lacks any flow. The examples are unrealistic and unclear. And the writing is turgid. I bought it to learn about normalization and other table design principles, and got nothing but frustration. It's some kind of university textbook, lacking any clear explanation of concepts. I've read several beginner books over the past few months, and this is not a beginner book. Nothing is explained. I've spent 4 hours on it, and am ready to send it back."
3,anti-m no waves in hell,"The following review was sent to the Anti-m.com web site. We were given permission to use it here.Predominantly a synths-based album, it featuresthe odd song, short link narrative tracks, theoccasional electric and electrifying guitar solos,spooky voices buried in the depths, some mightyflowing lead synth lines from the three musiciansand a staggering 21 tracks in sixty-eight minutes.The mood of the album is pretty varied from intensemulti-synth darkwave flows of warming music throughmore delicate refrains from guitar and the massivesynthbank that surrounds and envelops the mix,to the D.Mode stylesongs, on one of the strangest albums I've heardin ages. Like it? I'll tell you in three or fourplays time.maybe.Andy Garibaldi (Dead Earnest)"
4,High quality shower cap,"This shower cap is really nice, I love how the terry cloth lining helps keep moisture off the hair~ sometimes my hair would seem damp after a shower from sweating under a regular shower cap, it doesn't happen with this one. The only complaint I have is that the elastic is VERY tight. I wish it were about 1 inch bigger around. I have an average sized head, I don't think this cap would work for anyone with a large head."
2,"Made well, but tight",Great shower cap but only if you have a smaller head. It is so tight that it is hard to put around my head.
5,"""Great source for purists""",This book is a must for purists who really want to verify the origin of all major components. Mr. Colvin must have put a lot work into this and it shows. I highly recommend this book to Corvette collectors of that time period.
4,if your into numbers,the book is great if you are going to show your car casting numbers drivetrain parts even radio numbers
3,good,"I really enjoyed playing with this toy, the only problem was, was that after finnaly solving it, it started to get boring because you already know the formula. But other than that I really loved trying to solve some of the brain teasers"
5,Extremely satisfied and woud buy again!,"Very satisfied with the overall manufacturing and packaging, fitment was spot on, and bed-in procedure made the new pad to rotor interface and overall braking extremely effective. I've noticed a reduction in stopping distances, especially after repeated hard stops and a reduction in brake dust as well. No noises noted either."
5,A must read for all,"It was a great experience , learning from this book. All the technicalities have been explained in simple language. Content is highly practical for new learners as well as advanced programmers."
2,Readable and good characterization,"The book kept me turning the pages, and the characters were extremely imaginative and well-drawn. I give the book two stars for an original plot. But the ending ruined the book for me. It was too dreamlike and confusing - Zakriel?...out of nowhere, what was Del's secret?...what did Lucas & Jess have in common?... what was Ramsey turning into- Innat or something else?... what did the pact members actually DO when they got together... It all wrapped up too fast. I got that she's a necromancer, but whoopie. I wanted the characters' stories.I read many books a month and I can only characterize this novel as having great potential in its creative premise, but lacking a good editor to help the author bring the end together in a satisfying manner, or perhaps just fledgling writing."
4,So far so good......,"I've only had this stuff for a couple weeks now & haven't tried it all, so this review (imho) isn't very worthwhile yet. If I think about it I'll review it in a year! (ya, right :) ).The only thing so far I'm a bit disappointed in -well 2 things - is the square pan is 9x9"" (I didn't read all the dimensions I guess - I thought 8x8"" was more standard) and I don't like that the pan handles go so far out (for those of us with limited cupboard space this is not a good feature!). I almost sent the box back as I was sure that I was sent the wrong product! (The Amazon picture was different). Then I compared the sku (or whatever) numbers & found I did indeed get the right one.Otherwise, so far I've used the 9x13 & cookie sheet & they work nicely. :) Again, time will be the true test......."
3,Description doesnt match,"Description says it has a 4 1/2"" center hole, but the item I received has a 6 1/2 hole. I got this for my dog who has a pressure sore on his hip and its bigger than what I wanted, but I can make it work.It also say it uses a bicycle pump to fill it, but it doesnt. The valve is strange. You could blow it up by mouth, but its pretty difficult. I used a dust nozzle on my air compressor pressed up against it."
1,Does not hold air and customer service never answers or returns calls.,Left messages twice for customer service about this product not holding air and they never returned calls. Get answering system. Never a person. I will be returning product....It looks like a well-made tube but if I can't figure it out and they won't help to let me know if it is defective or if I am doing something wrong - what good is it. The little washers in stem are cheap and not round.
1,Not what I expected,"I purchased this product to take with me on trips. Nowhere in its description did I see that a bicycle pump was needed to inflate it. Since it was not practical to take such pump with me, I returned it.I am sure it is fine for sedentary use."
5,Great Learning Video,"ONE OF THE BEST VIDEOS TO TEACH YOUR KIDS THE ALPHABET AND WORDS. RECEIVED AS GIFT, OUR DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND SAYS THE ALPHABET AND WORDS WITH THE VIDEO. SHE WAS ABLE TO LEARN THE ALPHABET AND WORDS VERY EARLY AT 17 MONTHS, NOT MEMORIZATION EITHER AS SHE KNEW THEM IN ANY ORDER YOU SHOWED THEM TO HER.WILL BE BUYING THE ENTIRE SERIES FROM THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS VIDEO - SMALL-FLY.COM."
5,Real multi-purpose!,"I've now purchased three of these devices. I got one for myself couple months back, and two for my friends since. It's come in quite handy at work too.. so much so that they ordered a couple for our offices! It's just so compact and useful. Definitely a great buy!"
1,Data corruption!! Need I say more?,"Run, do not walk, from this product. Of all the SATA/IDE to USB converters I have used, this the worst of all. Data corruption to the max!! I lost several files while using the ""move"" command from the system main HDD to the HDD attached this thing. I know I should have used copy but... I ran a stress test (using USB bus analyzer) and this thing failed! I don't even think it's USB-IF certified.... I bought this because of the nice power switch cuz I was concerned about the spike of voltage when you plug the cable into the connector not cleanly, may damage my HDD. But the data corruption is a killer, period."
5,A must for the PC toolkit,"I was faced with recovering data from several PCs ruined by fire. The 3.5"" IDE drives were no problem, but then I got to the 3.5"" SATA and 2.5"" laptop drives. I really didn't want to buy different adapters for each kind so this device was a great find. I have also started checking out the shelful of hard drives I have in my shop which I have always meant to get to one of these day. The day has arrived thanks to this device. No problems so far--I just plug in the device and my XP PC recognizes it. I had noted the problem with the potentially reversible power adapter connector written about by another reviewer. This is a fairly common problem when nylon connector shells are not used. I simply added a 6"" power extension cable with nylon connectors on each end to make sure that I plug everything in correctly. The manual is in a form which is hard to print, but one is not really needed."
1,coolmax ide drive adapter,I tried this Coolmax adapter on a used Dell desktop and I am glad the computer was used as when I connected the USB plug there was a strong smell from the rear of the computer and the computer shut down. I waited 1/2 hour and the computer will not power up. I checked the harddrive that was connected to the device in another computer and it is ok. The Dell has bite the bullet and is junk now. Remind me not to use the coolmax adapter on a computer I want to keep working.-10 stars for my product review
4,Impressive Product,I'm really impressed with this little device. It allows you to access pretty much any hard drive via the USB port. Really handy!
2,Works for a while,"I had one of these and it worked great for a while, and almost considered buying another one. One day I plugged it in like normal to the same computer I used it on all the time, and it caused my USB port to start smoking, the converter started clicking and damaged the hard drive I had plugged into it. Cheap way to damage a lot of equipment."
1,Looks great - doesn't work,I plugged this into a 3.5 inch IDE drive. I started getting error messages immediately. I could transfer about 100MB and it would stop. It was a frustrating experience. I sent an e-mail to the manufacturer tech department but didn't hear anything from them. I would return it if I could figure out who to return it to. I gave it one star because I was able to copy some files.
1,Does its job... while it lasts,"I bought this device for my toolkit while working as a computer repair technician about half a year ago. The device generally did its job as advertised, but after leaving it in storage for the last couple months, I took it out last week and the mini USB port on it was no longer attached to the board, making it impossible to use anymore. I might understand if I had handled it roughly, but this happened while it was sitting in a drawer for two months. Incredibly bad construction, and not even close to being worth the cost unless you find a big enough sale to only expect a few months' use."
4,"Works Well, slightly advanced.","IF you are having problems getting your computer to recognize this device go into disc management and enable a letter for it. For some reason there is no letter associated with the drive you find and you need to give it a letter, then you can browse through the drive through my computer.I was able to pull pictures off of a 4 yr old hard drive, worked awesome for me."
1,Power surged - destroyed computer mother board & external hard-drived,"Used this converter 3-4 times without problems, until connecting with an old internal hard drive 1 day, a power surge resulted when the converter was connect to the computer. Destroyed sections of the computer mother board, & worse, caused the external hard drive to demand more power than the computer would allow accessing ... fortunately the computer was still on warranty, but the hard drive was not. Very sad experience ... so ""be careful out there""."
4,Pleasing performance: Dissappointing quality,"Though the Coolmax converter is very easy to use and works perfectly, it came apart in my hands when I took it out of the box. Its flimsy plastic clamshell case is very shoddy to say the least.I'd still buy it again though...it solves quite a few problems for a service tech like myself."
3,SellPhotos.Com: Your Guide to Establishing a Successful Stoc,This book does have alot of good information in it about establishing an online stock photography business.I gave it three stars because it is severlly outdated on the technology and URL's that are included as examples.
4,and oldie but goodie,"Much of the technical information in this book is out of date. However, the marketing and workflow information is valid and useful."
3,Too big to be good,"Sturdy, looks good built tough but unfortunately too thick for turning burgers or salmon. Instead of getting under the burger, it tends to push it. I use the OXO Goodgrip for delicate grills and keep this Weber for steaks and chicken."
5,Flip me!,"I bought this when I purchased my new Weber Performer grill. It has three, closely-spaced hooks on the front, and I thought it would look good hanging there. (It does.)Well, it turns out it works better for the grill than any other tool I have tried, and I've tried a lot of them. Sleek stainless shapes, that are easy to hold but don't have nooks and crannies that debris can get into. Just the right length, weight, and thickness. I'm really shocked!When I was using the spatula today, I noticed that the hook rotates down so that the handle is perfectly horizontal and ready to grab when placed on the side shelf.Somebody put a lot of thought into these. I honestly can't believe how inexpensive they are. I went back and bought the other items in the new Style line, and they are great too."
4,Caution: Weapons Change,"Overall, this is an excellent return to the famouse S-2 adventure with enough changes and expansions to make veterans of the original module keep on their toes and everyone will be entertained.However, for DM's who have incorporated the original adventure into their gameworld please take note that while the three weapons Wave, Whelm and Blackrazor reappear in this adventure, they no longer have their original alignments. Wave was True Neutral = Now Neutral Evil. Blackrazor was Chaotic Neutral = Now Neutral Evil. Whelm was Lawful Neutral and is now Chaotic Neutral.While this will have little affect on new campaigns, the hundreds (thousands?) of DM's who have already incorporated these weapons into their game world will have some editing to do."
4,Not too bad,"First of all, the camera that this goes to is slightly dissappointing. That's beside the point of this review though. The reason you are probably looking at this product is because you might be tired of the standard battery's short lifespan. This product lives up to the three hour life when you use it in viewfinder mode. The only thing I don't like about the battery is the size. It extends further than the standard one and it's almost embarrasing to have it. Other than the size the battery is a great and I would say must have accessory for this particular camera."
3,2 hours not 3,"I bought this battery as I had a two hour concert to record, and I figured a three hour battery would be ample. Using it with the JVC hard drive camcorder, I get a maximum of two hours battery life, not three. Maybe with a different camcorder it is three hours, but not mine."
