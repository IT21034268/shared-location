1,Horrible product,"Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used. It has nearly ruined my 2001fp. I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products. My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out. My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now."
3,A Double-Edged Sword,"The iKlear may be used by professionals, but a word of warning to all average citizens: it's hard to use. It cleans very well and produces a like-new appearance, but it's the process that is so dreadfully painful. Even with the directions, it is still difficult to produce the expected result in a relatively short amount of time.If you want a perfectly safe tool to clean your computer, this is the product for you. Just make sure you clear your schedule beforehand."
5,iKlear,"This product at first would seem way overpriced, but the truth of the matter is, that it works, nothing else I have tried does anyway near as well, and the little bottle will likely last you at least as long as the laptop or longer."
4,It works,"It works pretty well, but do we REALLY need two kinds of cloth for the process? may be a bit overpriced too"
5,Excellent Introduction to an essential topic,"As a student returning to school after a long absence, I felt I needed to brush up on some essential skills. Chief among these is critical thinking, as its use impacts everything we read, hear, and see to some extent. This book is an excellent introduction; it is clearly written, with each successive idea built firmly upon the previous ones. The authors use a minimum of jargon, and make no assumptions as to the reader's prior knowledge of logic or argument theory.I now have a command of the basic principles and terminology, and find myself making better arguments. More importantly, I can now spot flawed arguments as well as fallacies and rhetorical ploys that make up so much of public and political discourse. I expect to refer back to it many times in coming years."
1,Not a Nativity story,"This book just repeats the same phrase, ""I'll be there"" for each of the insects and rat that are, of course, going to be in the stable, except for two phrases ""In time to come they'll talk about this night"" and ""the woman swollen, waiting"", there is ZERO about why these creatures will be anywhere. I bought this because my daughter loves insects and I thought it would be an interesting perspective. I am now going to go see if I can get my money back."
4,Fran's Fab Fiftie's,"Loved reading and will love re-reading this book about the life of a teen in the fifties because I was there, too! Fran's delightful discriptions and recollections took me right back ""there"" to the cafes, classes, cars, and ""clutching"", and brought back a ton of memories, good and bad! For anyone who has been thru that shakey post-depression era, you will relate to Fran's fears, uncertaincies, needs, and trusting nature. It was the best of times for the carefree life of most teens: going to games, dances, good movies, fun clothes, and little crime. But Fran's life takes you past that facade to the real down-and-dirty life that went on for those who looked for it! And Fran not only looked, she found it!! She put herself thru hell but seemed to enjoy it! You'll laugh and cry with her and it may seem like a wild story, but it is true and she really lived it all. I will read it again, just for the fun of returning to ""those"" days! Thanks, Fran!"
5,She was a tomboy,"Fran is honest. She was a tomboy ('Girls need a reason to have sex, boys just need a place' Robin Williams, ??) and she was not shy about it: she enjoyed sex. This story only goes through her high school years and that is not enough. My wife and I both wanted to read more of what happened to her. She was such a wonderful, free spirit. She did have problems, but she dealt with them and moved on. She did not do a great deal of in depth soul searching in her writing, but you felt that she was doing it as she lived her life. She just did not clutter up her story with all that 'inner dialog.' She had a way with words, and every so often you marveled at her perceptions. She wrote one very interesting and wonderful story."
2,confused,"I just noticed the title is ""enormous engagement ring keychain"" but in the picture there's a heart shaped plate... which I added to a registry thinking it was the plate... I don't see a keychain anywhere, which one is it?"
1,Unhappy,I was very unhappy with this product. It says it's easy but it's very difficult to figure out unless you know about computers and plugs........I could not get the sound to work for nothing until my friend figured out we need another plug with by chance we had. But there was nothing in the product to explain set up or what you would need for sound or even how to use this product.
4,Great for the price,"We got one of these for my father, and had so much fun that my brother, brother-in-law, and I all got one too. I just keep the cables plugged into my sound card and the Aver card, and then just plug my camcorder into it when I want to download video.Yeah, the software's not perfect. I can't figure out why it is that each successive time you download a clip the automatic default time gets shorter and shorter, so if you don't re-set it manually, it clicks off after five seconds. Big pain. And don't use their DVD maker. I found the free copy of Nero Express that came with my DVD burner to be the best at that. And I wouldn't use it for copying full movies over to disk because of the file size unless you're planning to reburn over to a DVD and delete. But for copying those videos of your kid's soccer or baseball games, it's perfect."
4,Worked Great,"Although the product lacks in documentation, once I got past the install I had no problem getting it to work capturing various analog videos I have had sitting around.I have a DELL 2.X GHz pentium (just to give some context to the performance) and I captured at the maximum quality and I am very please with the result. I captured with the bundled software (Analog 8mm via composite port) but I created the DVD with the software I had bundled with the HP DVD so I cannot comment on that aspect of the product. The quality of the image was great and the sound was in sync with the picture ( I mention this as some seem to have an issue with some capture cards and sound syncronization). If you have a system like mine, this product is an inexpensive way of transferring those old Analog tapes to dvd.. copies of tapes makes a great christmas gift for relatives."
2,Audio Sync and Dropped Frames,"I am running a Pentium 4 2.4 Ghz with 512 MB RAM. I defragged my drive with Diskeeper. Still, I had audio sync problems and dropped frames. Also, the captured video even on the best setting was very pixelated compared with the analog source. I'm returning this and looking to invest in a better product with hardware conversion. You get what you pay for!"
1,AverMedia EZMaker DVD PCI,I recently purchased this product because I wanted to capture video from my vcr.While this product does do that I found it to be less than perfect. The video I captured often freezes when played back through windows movie maker. It is for this reason that I uninstalled this device from my computer.I will be purchasing a differnt capture card that is more reliable and stable.
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought a AverMedia EZMaker DVD PCI card and was disappointed with the quality... the price was great, but video where the camera was in motion (panning left to right, for example) was very pixellated. The NeoDVD software that came with it was horrible; it dropped frames so all my videos looked like the scary part from ""The Ring"". Using Roxio's Easy DVD Creator software was better, but still pixelated.Set up was fine and easy. Please see my review for the Pinnacle Systems Studio AV/DV 9 card, which costs twice as much but which produced perfect video."
1,returned,"After reading the reviews for this product, I bought it. I tried it for about 5 days and it is getting sent back. The video and audio does not match up. The quality of video is poor. What I try to use another program to capture the video, I cannot capture in high resolution and the audio and video still does not match up. I am going to keep looking for something else."
1,Save the money and headache,"I bought this product to convert my tapes into DVD. Installation and ease of use are not an issue. The problem comes when you try to capture your video. It drops frames to the point you don't want to watch the DVD any more. I searched online for a number of software which claim to fix this problem. None of them worked. I ended up buying a DVD recorder to do the job. Finally, I am done with this stuff."
3,No sound,Wasn't aware there wasn't a sound input on this card when I bought it - I'm sure it works fine but I have no use for it without sound so now I am shopping for a sound card - pain in the butt!@@
4,Works well,"The card installed per instructions without problems. The software supplied works as well. (Pentium 4, 3 GHz) The card is not compatible with Pinacle Studio software though. The images were more grainy than the original video tape. For home use and the price this was a good buy."
5,Tough and sharp,This case is great. It really does protect your Zune while at the same time giving it that 'ruggedized' look.
5,Great Product,"The product is great I think. Only issue I have is the rubber casing doesn't seem to completely fitted around the plastic screen insert. It isn't a big deal since the screen does not move and the rubber holds it in place, just doesn't look 'perfect' around the screen.Still the product works, does what is advertised, and besides what I mentioned, it looks great."
5,Great product.,"The case is easily the best around for the Zune. Snug, great protection, and the buttons are just as easy to use with the case."
3,Not the challenge I was looking for,"Although some of the exercises were modified for men - ""the hundred"" with hand weights - the overall video content was basic. Some of the standard ""beginning Pilates"" videos posed a greater challenge than this one."
3,lacking mechansim,These cards though sturdy could include the mechansims in the various reactions o-chem students will have the misfortune of learning. The fact that there are no arrows showing electron movements makes the deck somewhat incomplete. Fortunately there are ample room in the cards so that I as the student can write the mechansims myself. But then I might as well as write the reactions and make own flashcards.
3,Not bad...but...,"Good cards, but they are too closely tied to the related textbook for me (I use the Wade text for my course). Also, turns out it's easier and better to just make your own cards that deal specifically with what you need to memorize. Lots of cards that were way too simple and thus pointless. Other cards were good but not specific to the reactions I needed. If I was using the text that these are tied to, it could be useful to save time, but try making your own cards first."
1,"First Edition is terrible, don't know about later editions","The biggest problem is terminology. Technical terms were used before they were defined (if they were defined at all) and in such a way that the reader would not even KNOW the terms were being used in a context-specific, technical manner. When you run across a word or idea you don't understand, you look it up in the index, right? That didn't work. The book/index ""interface"" (?) was utterly unorganized. I imagine some problems have been corrected in subsequent editions. If you are looking for a good organic chem text to use as a reference, my understanding is that John McMurry's books are really good. I've had several chemists recommend his books to me."
3,"Good Book, Poor Teacher","The book is okay, but I had Whitesell for a professor this quarter and he taught in line with the book, which is rather unfortunate as my school uses the Vollhardt text and it's written at a much more advanced level."
4,Spinetta Exactas,"Te record is amazing. I was a little disappointed by the quality of the sound, but, this was probably the best quality the 80's gave in Argentina.Great album!"
3,joystick,works well enough for the price. all bells and whistles work finebut that is what you should expect from logitech very good stickI would say if you are a serious gamer this one is for you
4,Worth the money,"I use this Joystick for old games, like the ""Wing Commander"" series and found it to be responsive and centers well.For newer games it has the deficet of not having a ""Hat"". If any one is revisiting old classics, I would reccomend this inexpensive well made joystick.the base is sturdy and does not slide, or tip. buttons are well placed and large and responsive."
1,"unsupported, unrecognized at Logitech","followed the startup instructions on the paper work that came with the joystick.log onto Logitech.com, find your device, upload software; wait, what? device doesnt exist?apparently anyone who buys this and trys to get updates and software like the instructions suggest reach a brick wall, unsupported, unrecognized, tech support is worthless. suprise sucker."
2,Wrong Item,"The Logitech Attack 3 wasn't all I thought it would be. The thing I didn't realize, was it didn't have a twist function to steer. So I couldn't use it, and gave it to someone who didn't have a joystick. Now I'll just look further for another."
4,Solid joystick action - on a Mac!!!,"My Logitech Attack 3 just arrived from Amazon and I played around with it for about half an hour. I own a MacBook Pro (5,3) from 2009 and I am running Snow Leopard 10.6.8. I plugged it into a USB slot, fired up a game in DOSBox, and it worked instantly. No drivers or configuration necessary at all. Just instant action.The joystick feels very solid in the hand and has good resistance. The buttons require just enough pressure and give a satisfying click to let you know you pressed it right. The trigger is perhaps a hair sensitive, but that's probably not a bad thing when you're playing a combat flight sim game. While I haven't been using the joystick for very long yet, I am very pleased so far.There are some reviews claiming that these do not work with Mac computers. What can I say? I'm glad I didn't listen to them. This is a quality joystick that worked instantly with my Mac, so please don't be afraid to purchase it."
2,Logitech Attack 3 Joystick - highly limited,"Disappointing, purchased because it has a USB interface and thought would be a nice update for my MS flight simulators.pros: Nice and compact, and good feel for up/down (pitch), roll right/left (banking), but ...Cons: NO left/right (yaw) Rudder capability! If you intend to use this for flight sims, and anything requiring some thinking and manuevering, this will also disappoint you.No driver CD, instead you are instructed to go to LogiTech.Com. But once there, the only thing you can download is some gaming software. Their menuing system had difficulty indentifying the joystick, in spite of being provided product names and/or model numbers as instructed.The controller says it has 11 programmable buttons, but I find no way of assigning any functions to any buttons using my MS simulators.Look elsewhere if you're searching for a 3-axis joystick."
5,Great,I got this to play games. And I love it. Easy to use and calibrate. Had it now for several years anb it is still working prefect. No problems at all with it. I don't know how it would work for the serious or expert person as for games. But I have no problems and would recommend.
3,"Good setup, but don't last","I bought two of these, over the course of a year, for a friend who is a gamer as a gift. While the layout of the buttons is top notch, and can be used with either the right or left hand, this item just doesn't have longevity. I would still recommend this joystick over all others, as I am finding out none are made for heavy continual use."
5,Joystick,"My son has thoroughly enjoyed this joystick. It works great on his games, from racing to flight simulation and others. We highly recommend it."
3,No rudder...,"Wow, I guess the Amazon review system doesn't put the latest reviews on top and that actually causes issues in some cases.I got this for battlefield 3 so I could fly the helicopters, however there is no rudder control with this cheap joy stick...making it useless in battlefield 3.I didn't know anything about joysticks this one had good reviews on amazon so I got it. I had no idea that some joysticks didn't have rudder control.I had to read the reviews on NEWEGG to see that everyone had the same issue as me...no rudder control.The joystick works fine, just don't get it for battlefield 3 or any game that needs rudder control."
2,A Sorry Mess,"This product came to me with a broken button. I have tried to get returned, but with no success yet."
1,Joystick Junk,Broke within 2 months playing simple combatsim game on Vista PC. Tried using on different PC with same result. No control whatsoever.
5,Logitech Attack 3 Joystick,"Have used for a few months now and so far works great. Easy to setup with Logitech's profiler. I like the way you can set the controls for each game if you want. I would say best buy for the money and functions. So far Logitech has had good products and stands behind them with great customer service. Best of all, got it fast and lowest price at Amazon.com"
5,logitech attack 3 joystick,"This joystick is solidly built & comforatable during long sessions. It's a pleasure to use. The 12 programmable buttons make it very adaptable ( good for MS Flight Simulator ). Plus, the reasonable price makes it easy to afford. Overall I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Happy Customer,"Unit installed in seconds with no false starts or headaches of any kind. The base is wide and heavy and when placed on a mouse pad doesn't move around at all, even when I get a little too ""into"" my flight sim games. One can't beat the price either. For flying prop planes, I am very saisfied with the performance."
3,"careful, no twist","I haven't had this long enough to speak about durability, but if you're into things Mechwarrior, be aware this joystick has no stick twist capability, making it useless for games where this an issue."
2,Maybe I got a Lemon!?,Let me begin by saying I dislike negative feedback but in this case it is warranted. I purchased the control for use with Microsoft's flight simulator which I've always enjoyed using in the past and as a licensed pilot I can say it was realistic enough to be useful = particularly in instrument flights.However I cannot us the program because the Logitech Attack 3 Joystick continuously malfunctions. I run the calibration and all seems OK - but when I try to actually use it the control is so far out of calibration that if I ever relax the control or let go of it - the airplane immediately executed a diving roll to the right - goes inverted and crashes.The unit shipped without a CD (not even sure it is supposed to have one) and there was no manual. For me it is a frustration and a complete waste of money - Good luck with your - maybe mine is just a lemon!? I say this as I had one that worked previously - just can't remember the model I had.
3,OK JOYSTICK NOT THE BEST,I bought this joystick first off when I got my new computer and Flight Sim X trying to get a decent joystick for the price. The one benefit of this joystick is there are plenty of buttons on it allowing you to program lots of different things for the game. The one thing that was a downfall for this joystick was that there is no y axis (you can't turn the handle left and right (rotate))this made it very difficult to control the aircraft on the ground as I would be pushing a button to turn the wheel a little and than would have to push the opposite button on the other side the exact amount of times otherwise you're always turning in one direction. I was able to find a joystick that had this option for a cheaper rate than i bought this one for.
2,DO NOT BUY FOR BF3 - NO RUDDER,"Hopefully someone sees this (unlike me).The build quality of the Joystick is great, buttons are responsive and feels great in the hands until....you realize the joystick cannot rotate in the z-direction and you have no rudder control for helicopters and jets. Total buzz kill.Not really a product problem but a marketing problem (this needs to be in the item description) so 2 stars."
1,Calibration issues,"I recently purchased this item. I thought it was a fantastic joystick, besides the fact that you were not able to twist it. It worked fine for about a week and seemed very sturdy. Then in all the games I used it with, the calibration was off and everything always went to the left, even when not touching the joystick. I had calibrated it multiple times, and it would work well temporarily, but then it would start in again. I finally got fed up after recalibrating it 20 times and I returned it. Do not purchase it, it has issues."
2,Not the joy stick for FSX,This joy stick has a good feel and may be good for many video activities but it isn't worth a hoot for Flight Sinulator X. The control is just not precise enough for FSX so I gave it to one of my grandsons for some of his games.
2,Logitech Attack 3 Joystick,This joystick is a pretty basic unit...there is no POV hat and no rudder axis which may cramp the style of some gamers.
2,?,I bought this joystick for two games I have.. I cannot get it to work! I even bought a 'drive' program for my computer and updated all the drivers on my pc. The two games are indeed 'old' but I have used a joystick with them in the past and everything worked well.
2,Its not such a joy stick,We bought this joystick to go with a computer game that son has. It's not working and we aren't sure what to do. We've tried recalibrating the stick several times with no luck. It works for a few minutes and then the firing trigger stops working. It's a real disappointment for us.
1,DON'T BUY,"received this for use with red baron 2 and 3d.attempted to assign keyboard/button functions 10xtried to get online help for ten daysam returning to amazon per their EXTREMELY helpful return serviceunfortunately, now can't even uninstall what software i downloaded from logitech without messing with on line (MS,supposedly) service.AVOID AVOID AVOIDbased on my experience don't deal with logitech under any circumstance, no software included and site is down as often as up. online support is a joke.again, amazon is great, i hope they quit carrying this product line."
5,Fun to use,Bought two of these for my kids to use flight simulator. I was really suprized to see and feel the quality of this product during game use. This is well made and I would buy again.
1,Bad Dog Logitech,I never like to give any product a bad review but logitech joy sticks are just not realistic. They can't be calibrated and logitec suppot doesn't answer your inquiries when you contact them regarding these issues. I personally will not buy any more of their products including computer peripherial equipment. I would recommend any brand X product over logitech. At least you can get support when you need it.
2,Many buttons do nothing,"Many buttons do nothing even after downloading the related software - however, it is semi-functional at best - apparently this is not the correct product to use with Microsoft Flight Simulator X?"
4,Good control for car race games,"I bought this controller specifically for use with on-line car racing games. I find that it works very well for this purpose, with buttons right where they should be for good control. A great product for the modest price."
4,Two cents an hour for mild FS9 'flying',"For upwards of 1100 hours on FS2004 this stick worked fine (understanding there's no twist). The 'flying' was pretty mild stuff: VRF/IFR in taildraggers and the default 172/182: no ACM, no CFS. But after 1100 hours most every problem mentioned by anyone else showed up, simultaneously. I figure for about two cents an hour, what the heck."
2,"No frills, does the job, broke after a year.","Bought this for Battlefield 3 on the PC to fly jets and helicopters. Definitely gives me an advantage over the mouse and keyboard types (sometimes). Fit and finish is good and it works well with BF3 and my PC. The game has some weird issues with mapping control buttons (they don't match the labels on the stick), but with a little trial and error, it works.EDIT: Update as of 01FEB2013, this joystick finally broke on me after over a year of moderate use. Using the Microsoft game controller settings and its diagnostics, this controller doesn't register anything when rolling to the left. The raw data just goes all over the place. Attempts to calibrate have been unsuccessful.I know this wasn't expensive, but to only last over a year?"
4,Very good for the price,"A very good joystick for the price. I used it for my first attempts at games such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. No doubt that people that are serious about those types of games will want something with more finesse, but for those that just want to have some fun flying, it's great."
4,Not bad,"Bought and used for MS FlightSimX. Stick worked flawlessly, installed quickly, and the buttons were in decent places.However, the stick has no way to control Yaw, and the throttle is in a odd position. Returned because it wasnt what I was looking for"
1,"Hopes = hoped it was better, Wishes = this was better, Dreams = Never dreamed this could be so horrible!","Horrible, major disappointment! Maybe 2 songs that I like on this.Very poorly done, Ray Thomas with the Moodies is awesome, this just fell flat.."
5,T-Pro Xtreme -- Expanded quality,"This is the third piece of luggage of this serie (TravelPro Xtreme - Granite) that we have acquired. Two years ago we bought the Backpack and the 19"" Rollaboard luggage. Considering the importance of the total weight of the luggages and the possibility of extra charges when overweighted, the lightness of the empty luggage is a priority. In addition, TravelPro products are very solid and waterproof. We had the opportunity to notice that last winter upon a stopover at Atlanta airport during a snowstorm. Our luggages were exposed to melting snow during a certain period of time and the content of the TravelPro rollaboard was completely dry while the content of another piece of luggages from another company was soaked."
5,The Macintosh iLife,"Excellent resource for iLife.I'd been playing with iLife for months. This book, and it's well-done accompanying DVD, revealed the 70% of iLife I hadn't figured out. Concise, comprehensive. Ties iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie and iDVD together very well.Best supporting tech resource I've ever used.Also, a strong selling point for iLife and iMacs."
5,"Excellent book, concise, great examples, great dvd","This is one of the best technical books I have ever read. I work in Tech support and understand it is very difficult to write computer related books that a non-techie person can understand.His examples and diagrams in the book are excellent. The DVD is excellent as well. I showed both the DVD and book to a few friends of mine (who are artists and designers) - they both made the same comments - that both are written extremely well and very understandable.Everytime I read this book I am amazed at the clarity, the design, the easy-to-understand explanations. I wish every tech writer could write like Jim Heid. Highly recommended."
4,Christmas gift,"I read Black Maestro this summer. It was a great read so I'm buying several more copies to give as Christmas presents. The book works on several levels. It is first and foremost a book that details the triumphs of a black man at the turn of the century and his subsequent quest to do what he loves to do - race horses. The book also describes the trials that the black athelete faced in the United States during the first half of the 20th century. It would take 50 years before atheletes such as Jackie Robinson and Hank Aaron were able to break the ""color barrier"". Finally, Black Maestro is a great adventure across two continents and through two world wars - I imagine Hollywood is already chomping at the bit to get this story on the silver screen."
4,"good read, good perspective","the sport of horseracing owes much to the African Americans who have nutured its athletes. Rarely, however, are those unsung heros shared with the public.This well written and very well researched book shares the life of one of the sport's more colorful participants and gifted partners to equine athletes - Jimmy Winkfield.The pages kept turning, the story was fascinating, and the author did a lovely job in both pace and content.If you have any interest in the ""sport of kings"" and those who make it come to life, this book is an important read. For those who just want to read the story of a gifted athlete whose genetic makeup destroyed his promise on American soil, this will inspire you as to Jimmy's fortitude and once again bewilder you at the mindset that eventually took his craft out of his home country.put it on your read list."
3,Portals in a Northern sky,"This book has an interesting premise but is a little hard to follow. It was, however, overall a good read."
4,"Blending the ""here"", ""there"" and ""everywhere"".","What an interesting and thought provoking book this one turned out to be! With its blending of the past and present, philosophy, action and adventure, science fiction and literature...it covers most of the bases. Unique in both its premise and its delivery, ""Portals in a Northern Sky"" takes you on a journey, one both physical and mental and gives you cause to think about your relationship with everything. Were it not for a number of editing errors and omissions, I would give this one 5 stars...no question about it; however, as it stands, I give it 4 1/2. I suggest you offer your mind and psyche something a little different as a change in your normal reading habits, and this incredible book will certainly fill that bill."
5,Hopkinson makes you believe,"I finished this book in a spell. Hopkinson weaves the stories of young immigrants and the story of the growing city into a rich experience for the reader. Her choice of detail, her gift for story telling, and the wonderful and often poignant photographs make this (beautifully designed book) irresistible. In the end you believe-as Hopkinson clearly does-that the past has meaning because of the individuals that lived it, and that their stories must continue to reverberate. It isn't ""just"" the past; it's what we're made of."
3,Young Adult Educational Guide to the Lower East Side,"This book has both photos of the lower East Side at the turn of the 1900s and excerpts from original diaries.It presents the immigrant and work experience from the point of view of actual young people of the time. If you want a synopsis of this experience for yourself or for children and young adults, it's a good introduction."
3,ISHTAR evolves.....................,"As Ishtar becomes more popular, she is, alas, making the inevitable transition from worldbeat dance diva to pop star. This album reflects this evolution. While there are a couple of uptempo worldbeat songs similar to her earlier albums (both as solo artist and as part of the group Alabina), the exotic instrumentation and heavy percussion are muted here in favor of highlighting her voice in more midtempo (and blander) pop tunes and ballads--more than what I had hoped for. Her voice, nonetheless, is undeniably beautiful and moving---in whatever language! However, if you're looking for a more high-energy exotic dance experience, check out her other solo outing on *La Voix D'Alabina*. Or better yet, sample her singing when she was a member of the group ALABINA."
4,Simply what I supposed to be,"It is exactly what I supposed to be: a really nice cd of music (moreover, I needed a song from it for a ballroom)."
1,A real disappointment,"I installed the scanner and downloaded the most recent OSX software from the HP web site. The product claims there is no warm up time. That is correct if you dont count the 35-40 second wait time for each and ever scan! Also, the auto photo feeder did not work. Many hour spent trying to make the equipment work. Finally had enough and took back to store."
5,already did review a few weeks ago,"I did an extensive review some two weeks ago! Said the product was excellent, arrival time was unbelievably rapid and all is well. EXTREMELY SATISFIED!"
2,Photo Feeder? Hello?,"Anyone know how to get the photo feeder to work these days? I think I have the latest driver, but I cannot find any way to run the photo feeder at all. I've used it in the past with some success (pre 10.3). But now I'm running 10.5 and it seems as though the photo feeder is no longer supported by the driver! Does anyone know how to run it?"
1,zero stars not 1 star... run away,"this product is terrible, the only reason you might want one is to bulk scan photos but then you find the thing won't do a good job - the auto-crop software does not work and you end up getting your photo with a bit of the scanner's pieces visible as well, so then you're into doing work by hand on each image to manually crop. sort of defeats the purpose. hp support is useless on this subjec too. run away."
2,"Fast, high quality scans, but....","I bought this primarily for the automatic photo feeder. It was great to be able to put in a stack of photos (I went up to 25 at a time) and walk away while it scanned. Had only one or two times when the feeder jammed; wished it would have allowed continuing after clearing the jam instead of stopping scanning on the batch completely. Quality is excellent but I'm returning it as it takes too much time to adjust the scans afterwards (""auto straighten"" feature doesn't help--photos frequently feed crooked; part of scanner hardware ends up in the scans; frequently get 1/2"" black band on left in scans). I might as well scan each manually so it will be done right the first time."
1,Scanner doesn't work even with Tech Support,"I purchased this scanner because I needed something for negatives and photos, my husband needed something for documents. The negative scanner works ok as long as you do it from the scanner software and not editing software like photoshop or paint shop. The photo auto feeder has never worked. I spent 2 and 1/2 hours on ""live support"" from them and was bounced through 3 ""agents"". (I got one of them twice) Not only could they not solve the problem they infromed me, after I told them that I was tired of waiting for them to ""review the notes"", that my best option was to contact them the next day. Then different people would be there.I wouldn't ever recommend this scanner or this company to anybody."
2,returned it the very next day,"I bought this unit, and was pretty excited about the photo feeder.Unfortunately it didn't work. The feeder would make noises but would never grab any photos.I tried chatting with HPs support over the internet. It was horrible. I had to sit and wait as many as 7 or 8 minutes for the guy to type a response back. And all he could suggest was I try a different kind of paper (hmmm, lets see, its photo paper?)So I took the scanner back the very next day. Don't waste your money on this. There are much better scanners available."
2,Not Worth the [money] for APF,"If you are interested in the photo feeder, it does notsave time, every 3-4 photos it would show a jam(but there was no jam) I would have to reset the photosand start again. Cust support was no help. Luckily I[was able to] exchange it for another one,I had the same problems with it. The auto crop did not work,and when I tried to change the folder to where the imagewould scan to, it still would send it to the default.Picture qualty was great,software was easy to use.I never got a chance to try the slide adapter. Lid isalso very heavy, become a nausance when scanningnumerous photos. I went back to my [] compaq s200."
1,Please do not purchase this product,I purchased this scanner on March 14th 2005. The feeder did not work from day one. After contacting HP Customer Support I was told that I would need to replace the feeder for an additional $129.00!Please do not throw your money away on this scanner.
4,Great product and tech support,The APF that came in the box never worked. It would repeatedly jam after every photo. Half an hour with tech support resulted in a APF replacement under warranty. I called support on a Saturday and UPS delivered a new APF on Thursday. Now the scanner performs beautifully and gets through 40+ photos at one time.The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the auto crop feature needs improvement. Every photo still needs to be manually cropped around the edges.
3,pretty good but not perfect,Overall no problems but I did want to state that the photo feeder does leave a small roller mark on the picture (only visible when the light reflects off) and it takes a while to get the hang of the feeder (it tends to jam). Also there is some kind of automatic thing in the software which auto-crops the picture when using the roller...this tends to mess up and distort the picture size (so I have to preview twice). These are the only gripes I have...everything else is great and it sure beats scanning every picture individually by hand.
1,Total garbage,Whatever you do- do not buy this scanner!! The photofeeder does not work at all. I can't believe they are actually selling this. I will never buy another HP product again.
2,Scanner good but gadgets disappoint,"I would not recommend this product. Setup was easy on Windows XP but the main problems are with the 'gadgets'. The auto photo feeder (APF) is little more than a plastic toy. It left fine parallel score marks (scratches) along the direction of glossy photos as they were scanned. This seems to be a known design issue and could not be fixed by Tech Support. I was told a replacement APF would not help. The multiple scans were not straight and there were too many problems for auto correct. You may as well scan one by one in the first place. As for the capabilities for scanning slides and negatives, my advice is get a proper slide scanner. The software for the 5500c does not handle this task very well and trying to scan B&W negatives is a total waste of time."
1,College Instructor,Out of the box...When I tried to scan the FIRST 2 pictures the second one jammed each time...every time.I need to scan in thousands of small photos. This is not acceptable. I'm returning it to [local store]...
2,I made a mistake!,"I purchased this scanner on the extremely high recommendation of the sales rep who told me it is the ""ultimate"" scanner; after installing the software & uninstalling the software a few times, I called the NONTOLL-FREE HP Help LIne. The CSR suggested I unplug and replug in the cords to the scanner's power source, then to my laptop then unplug this cord and that cord yadda yadda yadda...15 minutes later,the same exact error message came up. Finally the CSR told me, without an ounce of surprise in his voice, that my unit is defective!!! Aaaaagh!"
1,Wormy is the problem,I love spongebob as much as the next guy but the episode Wromy without a dought has to be the worst episode of spongebob ever.I thought it was so stupid it was an insolt to spongebob history.
2,This Is Great!,This video is great! Even my best friend Tommy has it! We both LOVE Spongebob! That's why I got this on VHS and others! LONG LIVE SPONGEBOB!
1,poor,"I was so excited to receive this product. It took me 3 attempts to bring sound from the mix max to the speakers. When I finally heard sound, it is so low I would have to have complete quiet in the room in order to hear the music. Overall the speakers look great, but thats where it ends. Do not buy this..."
3,Great speaker - but does NOT work with new Mix Max,"I bought these speakers to use with the Hannah Montana Mix max. The connectors on the pass through on the speakers do not fit correctly, and therefore do not have a full connection. So, the only way to play the Mix Max is to hook it up like a regular MP3 player using the cable. By doing this, you lose the ability to charge the mix max.It looks like the Mix Maxs were redesigned, and the speaker manufacturer did not redesign their pieces accordingly.So the speakers are great, just not with what they say it will support.Be cautious if you plan on using any of Disney's 2GB expandable to 16GB Mix Max's.Oh and the website they direct you to for assistance is the [...] Call the phone number, and it is disconnected :(."
4,Great sound!,"Very surprised with the quality of sound from these. I connected my Iphone and was playing music through it for a while and it was clear, good base nice sounds. Then I loaded the kids mix max mp3 and they love it. Charges the mix max mp3 and keeps everything neatly together."
5,Must-have for teachers!,"This is just so handy to have around. I highly recommend this to any teacher. I lost the one I bought a few years ago and so I bought a backup! Now (of course) I found my original one, and I have two! Very easy to use and I use this item almost daily."
5,Very Handy,"As a new teacher, this saved me a lot of time in grading. I was able to quickly and accurately grade tests. This is very easy to use and I highly recommend it."
3,"Great, but there are free tools online","These EZ graders are great, but we're in the 21st century, aren't we? Tools like quickgrade (google it!) make this kind of thing obsolete."
3,good overall.great for math,"Overall I consider this book OK. BUT if you are weak in math..this book has the most comprehensive overview on math. Best compared to Crackin, Kaplan, Dummies, OG. The other sections I simply used for additional practice and I did not find their explanations to be anything special. I like that they give you a good list of ""things to memorize"" and they rate the level of difficulty of each question. If you need additional Math practice w/ some detailed explanations this is a great resource. I also recommend for those math impaired(like myself) to invest in a math overview book. I bought a used copy of ""Math Smart"" well worth my time & money! It will take you about 6 hours to work through ""Math Smart"" but it is worth it to refresh you mind. It does not offer GMAT practice questions but it does cover most topics tested."
2,Too many errors,"I was quite disappointed with the quality of the book. Though the content itself is okay, but the quantitative review section had too many incomplete sentences, missing fractions and equations. This made this section of the book difficult to comprehend. I had to jump straight to the practice questions with out the benefit of having completed the review section."
5,Excellent Study Guide,This book provides a comprehensive study guide to the GMAT and I highly recommend it after scoring 720 on the exam.
3,GMAT 2007-2008 Review,"I like the book thus far but was wondering why it did not provide a CD Rom, this will be most useful when studying.Thanks"
1,This is not Phase Locked Loops!,"What a horrible book! . If you are an IC designer it might give you 8% of good information, otherwise 0%....this book does not deserves to be called PLL..IT IS NOT!"
4,A very nice Kenworth replica,"A nice replica of a W900 series Kenworth rig. Just FYI, the kit's right-hand drive setup is achieved with an overlay piece that fits onto the cab floor... leave the overlay out, and you can build this as a left-hand drive vehicle."
4,Little below standards for a Revell of Germany kit,"Revell of Germany kits are usually top notch, but this one falls a little short. The frame takes some work to get it to line up and square up correctly. The parts should have a tighter fit than what they have. The instruction sheets are lacking as well as paint scheme instructions. It's still a great kit and subject matter, so don't pass it by, just beware."
4,Cost versus Ambiance,"Have always loved the soft warmth of the pink light bulb in any room. That said, the price here is extremely high. I know there is a light bulb supplier who can do a much better online price; however, I like the convenience/ security of using Amazon. My purchase came well packed and my room looks 100% better for using this harder to find purchase."
2,Not So Pink,I ordered 2 and 1 bulb burnt out the very first day I used it. The pink is so subtle that it isn't even worth calling pink.
2,"Very slow moving, but a descent story.",The movie moved slow. We kept waiting on it to pick up and it never did. The movie was descent (acting and principle of the story). But it was hard to stay with it because it didn't seem to go anywhere.
5,Awesome Movie!!,I love this movie! I got goosebumps watching it. My mother that is not a fan of the Grateful Dead like I am loved it as well. This is a must see movie for all!
4,Heart tugging movie that really works,"After spending over 47 years of my life listening to and going to Rock, R & B, Soul music shows and over 530 Grateful Dead shows, this movie really hit home. The Music Never Stopped actually gets it right and shows how important music really is in life. The cast is perfect, especially J.K. Simmons..."
5,THE MUSIC NEVER STOPS: KIND WOMAN!!,"Great movie based on a book by one my favorite writers. The importance of music has always been known to me, but gets a deeper meaning in this movie, played by such great actors. For me the highlight however is to hear one of the best songs ever written by Richie Furay and played by his first mayor band, Buffalo Springfield (with Neil Young and Stephen Stills): 'Kind Woman'. It has major 'airtime' in this movie and rightfully so. Richie made the song a classic with Buffalo Springfield and his own group, the legendary POCO. To hear it in this new fresh movie defines the song as a major classic, and Richie deserves every bit of respect and glamour for it. Let's hear it for the good guys!"
4,well-done cross generation story,"The trailer indicates that the family is dealing with a health issue that is solved by crossing musical preferences. It is much more -- anyone who is in their 60's or 70's now or knows someone who is will see that person in the father and his preference for music of his era. The young man, who is now in his 40's lived intensely what so many went through in one form or another in the 1960's and 70's. It is about generations getting out of their ""my way is the right way"" fix and finding the beauty in other's preferences, and through their acceptance find love and forgiveness."
5,Great Movie!,"Great film, w/ an amazing story line, and music! Its a shame the budget wasn't a little higher. I think i have to read the book it was based on now."
5,The power of music...,"Based on a true story, this is the story of the dedication of a father to truly understand his son who can only remember via the soundtrack of his life. The sweetness of this story and the amazing power of music are shown with compassion and honesty. There are some funny places in the movie as well as some quite sad times, but the message and meaning behind this lovely film are just beautiful.I don't want to give too much of the movie away. We saw it knowing little to nothing about the story. Being surprised by this very interesting and original story is part of the fun and charm.There were seven of us who watched this together and we all, without question, recommend this movie quite highly. It's a powerful film and is a must-see."
4,The Last Hippie,"This was based on a true story by famous British neurologist Oliver Sacks (who wrote such books as ""Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain.""I thought this was a fascinating movie about how music therapy can benefit those with severe brain damage. Also a must see if you're a fan of the Grateful Dead!"
5,Artists through the eyes of a fashion photographer,"One of the best designed books I have ever seen. Book features vellum overlays, and large photographs of artists, their studios and artworks. Excelent art coffee table book for art lovers and novices alike."
3,Pretty good guide,I think this book is pretty good guide to crafting a job resume but it is a little bit outdated.
2,It's an Okay Source,"I actually ordered Volume 1 & 2. Unfortunately, you find pretty much the same material (resume examples) in both editions so purchase only edition 1 or 2. The resume styles are decent, but I recently learned it has changed and I couldn't find an example of that style in either (new style sent to me by an HR professional in field 33 years.) Some of the most common resume tips for older workers is also not mentioned and extremely important. I would recommend it, but not to any Executive Level Management person."
1,A Loony Book for Lunatics,"I wish I could give negative stars. Let's start with the fact that the author is barely literate enough to put a sentence together. She continuously misuses words (although apparently she does use a spell-checker, though that might have been her editor), rambles incoherently, and in general this screed reads like the writings of someone locked in a mental institution for paranoid schizophrenia.Basically, that is what this is: the ramblings of a paranoid schizophrenic. There are NO facts here. She makes statements she cannot possibly back up (largely because she made them up in her own head). I would feel sorry for her, because it must be terrible to live in such constant fear, except that she is loose and has access to guns.This author should be given treatment for mental illness, not a political platform."
1,None,"First off, I am a Christian. I believe that Jesus Christ, who was born of the virgin Mary, is my savior. However, I can clearly see that this book was written by an idiot. Anyone who homosexuality is bad should keep in mind that they are bullying people who don't deserve it simply because of a verse that's in the same book as one that says you can't wear two different types of fabric at the same time. Also, it has been proven that the Ancient Greek the Bible was originally written in has been mistranslated many times. Out of all the verses on one page, each one has at least eight different translations in English. For the first time in your lives, disregard all Christianity and answer this: what is wrong with gays? How could possibly hurt heterosexual marriage? Anyone who says I've just wrote heresy is afraid to throw off the security blanket that is their bigotry and use the brain and conscience God gave them."
1,Wasting an interesting subject,"The title of this book clearly broadcasts that it is not an especially careful or balanced treatment, but I thought I'd give it a chance because of the importance of the subject. I shouldn't have bothered. This is just the standard mish-mash of unrepresentative anecdotes and fear-mongering typical of the pulp books produced by both the political left and right in the U.S. If you want to read a far more thorough, responsible, and realistic book related to this topic, try instead Divided by God: America's Church-State Problem and What We Should Do About It by Noah Feldman."
2,Poor formatting in Kindle version,"I purchased the Kindle version and will not review the book for content as I have had some real issues trying to read it. The format is terrible! There are typos all over the place, misspellings, extraneous letters and other characters randomly inserted everywhere. Quotes are not clearly indicated so readers are not sure if they are reading a quote or the author's words. Indentation varies from paragraph to paragraph. Are these the preliminary galley proofs or the final text? The Kindle version is terrible and the publisher needs to clean it up. It is not worth the price in the current form. It is a difficult book to read because of all the format problems."
4,Excellent Work,This book provides unique insight into the rehetoric of economics and the social sciences.
5,Excellent product.,I've been using these for a few years now. I have an 80 and a 120 grit. I attach mine to a large hand-held Milwaukee grinder/sander and use it to sand away the softer portion of douglas fir wood to give it a weathered look for my furniture. Buy one.
1,Sadly its a flawed product,"The book is attractively laid out and the history and biographical sketches of famous or important slide players adds something to the overall product. However, as another reviewer has noted, the titles of the tracks as cited in the text does not match up with the tracks on the CD. You will have to go through all 54 tracks and write the number of the actual track onto the text. Pete Madsen might be a fine player, but the publisher needs to fire the editor that let this product out the door."
5,Lovely Earrings,"These are delightful small earrings which are perfect for a second or third piercing in the ear. They are quite durable and safe to sleep in. The post is not a small one, but regular size. Good product"
5,awesome,"I bought a lot of these earrings for stacking all the way up my ear, since i have got them i haven't taken them out, they are the perfect size for stacking, I LOVE THEM!! THEY DO NOT TURN YOUR EARS BLACK OR GREEN!!!!! You can't feel them in so it is easy to wear them 24/7, great buy!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Silver Plated Not Silver,I loved these when I got them. I have 5 piercings in each ear and loved that I had options to get different sized balls so I could stack them up my ear. They worked well for 2 weeks and then my ears started bothering me. I wore these 24/7. Other people have mention the discoloring on the post of the earring. Mine were not only discolored but the metal was corroding. I ended up with an infection in most of my ten piercings. Do not buy this product if you need silver earrings.
4,not the usual american supernatural fare,"No hysteria or built from the usual cookie-cutter formula in American cinema with all to do with horror or supernatural. All the more surprising since revolves around a college student.His room-mate had been up to mischief putting a curse on a fellow student using black magic and has unleashed an occult prence in the apartment in the process. The room-mate finds the books and candles, gets a professor to translate the Latin. From then on it turns into A VERY SPOOKY MOVIE as a presence gradually makes itself known.I was watching this on a sunny afternoon but this would be one frightening film to watch in the dead of night, alone, worse ,in an old house......one * less for not being as freaked out as he should be."
4,Fascinating and obscure,"Very uneven sometimes amateurish production but full of creativity, wonderful lighting, sharp performances and atmosphere. A must for a Laurence Harvey fan. His only directorial effort. Good score as well"
2,Childish emotional feel + some great one liners.,"Great example of the 1960's Childish-Aesthetic: Actors and story feel a bit stupid, unexplained, and oversimplified so it bores like a children's level story intellectually that is played with adults.Yet the childish presentation alternates with some great one liner truths. The Tangiers' leader wants some credibility for Tangiers by having real law enforcement that the world believes they don't have. And near the end a priest forces the criminal to understand that there is some good in men with a brilliant statement about God and the criminal's brother, a type of statement which is rarely seen in a film.Sara Miles satisfies as mentally tormented beauty girlfriend wanted by two men. Always sad when she leaves the screen.1960's anti-establishment ending, on an emotional level, somehow blames the authorities for the criminals stealing and ruining of his own family; this is the ending ""twist"" to satisfy the non-sense sensibilities of the day - Ug!"
5,It's Duke Nukem!!,How else can you review Duke? This has got to be one of my favorite games in the world. Older game so getting it to work with my Windows 7 computer was a little tricky but well worth the effort.
1,DUMB,"this movie was so stupid. i maybe cracked a smile once, MAYBE. out of the 3 other people who watched this movie with me, exactly 0 people thought it was good. it'll be going on eBay.i love ben stiller, he absolutely cracks me up. owen wilson is pretty funny too, but this movie has a dumb plot (if you could call it that) and dumb, corny humor. ben stiller is hilarious in 'there's something about mary' and 'meet the parents' because he is NOT TRYING TO BE. i felt as if the actors were trying too hard to be silly and it was just not working.if you want to see movies that truly make you laugh and have funny plots, see 'meet the parents' and 'there's something about mary' instead. don't waste anything on this movie."
1,Offensive and Stupid -,"Ben Stiller wrote and starred in this boring, overly offensive vanity ""comedy."" It is a spoof of male models and fashion industry, which evolves into a sort-of political statement drama on child labor. Every scene is stupid and many are offensive. The stars that agreed to be in this should be embarrassed (Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson). It is not even worth one star, but it got as far as a DVD. The sex and drugs in this grasping for laughs movie offends and becomes boring. I thought there would be a few laughs, but was very wrong.No redeeming value"
2,Could have been much better,"I love Owen Wilson (see him in movies with Jackie Chan). I love Ben Stiller -- and his whole family! I loved the premise -- dumb male model gets involved with spy types, action hero responses required, etc. But somehow, I just don't think they pulled it off. Though somewhat funny, the two male models weren't funny enough -- they needed to exaggerate the characters more. Or else, they needed to take it the other way, and make it more serious, with humorous overtones (aka: Jackie Chan). I went away from the movie ultimately dissatisfied, feeling let down in my expectations. Try again, fellas!"
2,Barely worth watching......,"This was a disappointment. Stiller was doing so well until he released this film. I enjoyed him in ""Something About Mary"" and ""Meet The Parents"". But this film did nothing for his carreer.I believe I saw in the credits that he wrote and directed this one... If so, he has found something that he is not good at. :)I hope he can recover from this..."
1,Irritating vanity project,"What a piece of junk. First of all, Ben Stiller is no director. He also can't act. He puts his mom, dad, and other assorted relatives in this ""movie"" if you can call it that. I call it junk. Absolute garbage."
1,One star because there is no negative 5 option,"In a word, innane. In two words, sophomoric and stupid. Don't bother. Between over the top portrayals and no perceivable plot, this is a waste by any standard."
1,WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU??,"What is wrong with all you people who think this movie is so great and funny? it's the stupidest damn thing i've ever seen! to those of you who haven't seen it, do yourself a favor, and don't waste your time or money. it's totally lame..........."
1,Stupid comedy about a moron,"While Ben Stiller can be a hilarous actor, this movie wastes his formidible talents.Stiller plays Derrick Zoolander, the top male model and one of the world's greatest idiots. He was deposed by Hansel (Owen Wilson) in a fashion award show. Meanwhile, he discovers the fashion industry is plotting to assassinate the democratic prime minister of Malaysia.And he's the brainwashed assassin.This movie was loud and obnoxious, the jokes synthetic, and just utterly stupid. The characters are stereotypical and shallow, dialogue weak, and plot thread-bare.In other words, this movie is truly about the fashion industry!"
1,The dumming of America!,"...This was one of the worst movies pieces of teenage junk I have ever seen. Even my teenage son thought it was stupid and left.I think I laughed once through this entire boring escapade - (I laughed at how pitiful the script was, how moronic the acting was, and how stupid I was for actually buying it!You could tell they were trying to mimic Austin Powers comedy but it couldn't shine Ausin Power's shoes....there is less than five minutes of funny content in this whole movie. The problem is - they stretch it out to almost two hours! I guess because they kept trying to get you to laugh but continue to fail at it.Give yourself a break and skip this one. This one goes on my top ten worst movie list."
5,Zoolander DVD,"This is an extremely funny movie! If you like fashion and comedy, I definately recommend this movie! It is nonstop laughs for 2 hours!"
4,very funny film,"ben stiller awesome, and pretty ripped. didn't know that. i was shocked. a great piss up. with some good cameos."
3,Funny if you like silly stuff!,This movie is funny and entertaining. If you like Saturday Night Live types of humor then this movie is for you!
3,fashionista farce,"This movie got some seriously bad reviews, but I liked it as a biting and farcical satire of the idiocies of the modern fashion industry."
3,Could have been better,"The fashion industry and male models aren't quite large enough targets to sustain a feature-length satire. In Zoolander, they're vapid, vain, prissy, and...after about twenty minutes, the movie struggles to make it to the few other valuable laughs along the way. Stiller does a good job, but filling that many screen minutes with such a thin character is tough. Supporting members of the cast like Owen Wilson and Will Farrell have a much, much easier job. I appreciated the references to classic films, even though they were done in an overly obvious way. In all, it's more on par with Mystery Men than Something About Mary."
2,One LOOOONG Joke.,"That's the problem with this film. It has its moments but they are few and far between. It is really just the same joke over and over. Owen Wilson was funny at times, but overall this was a waste of time. The idea of satirizing the fashion industry is a good one, but does not maintain momentum over a full length feature film. Is anyone really surprised by this!?"
4,Slyer than you think,"I loved the inventiveness of this movie. On one level, it's superficial fluff. On another level, there are sly little parodies of Rocky, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Coal Miner's Daughter, The Manchurian Candidate, Fight Club, and others I probably missed.Worth it solely to see Will Ferrell, hysterical as designer Mugatu, saying ""That Hansel, he's really hot right now"" every time Owen Wilson crosses his path."
3,not as funny as it could have been,"I applaud Ben Stiller for what (I think) is his first effort at writing and directing a film. All in all, it really wasn't bad. He's pretty funny himself in the movie - although his voice grates on you by the end - and Owen Wilson also gives an amusing, at times hysterical performance. There are plenty of celebrity cameos, some of which seemed pointless (David Bowie) and some of which were hilarious (David Duchovny). However, even if you add up all the funny parts, the movie still comes off as lacking. Great soundtrack though. I'd recommend it to people who love Austin Powers type humor but aren't expecting too much."
4,"Hansel so hot right now, Hansel","Zoolander is easily one of the best comedies out there. Funnyman Ben Stiller shines as Derek Zoolander, a male model who is not the smartest guy around. His competition is Hansel (Owen Wilson) another male model. When Zoolander is beaten for male model of the year award by Hansel, he decides to retire as he belives theres to life then being ""really, really ridiculously good looking"". When he is asked back by fashion designer Mugatu (the hilarious Will Ferell) he is reluctant but accepts, little does he know Mugatu has a secret plan to brainwash Derek to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister. Also starring Jerry Stiller (Ben's dad) and Christine Taylor (Ben's wife) this film is hilarious and very entertaining. Stiller and Wilson are excellent as rivalling models and also very funny. If you're looking for a good comedy you cant go past this one."
5,"Funniest Movie Ever? Close, really really rediculously close","Folks, don't let these previous reviewers throw you off with the term 'goofy' comedy...for this (no exaggeration) is one of the most geniously written comedies of our modern generation...In my opinion this is the second funniest movie ever (And i've seen a good share from Arsenic & Old Lace to Dr. Strangelove to Titanic). At first watch, this film will no doubt seem sort've stupid....but get past that, watch the film a second, third, and fourth time....Every line in this film is comedy, literally. If the movie is watched with an open-mind and listend to every second, your hour-and-a-half will be one of the most entertaining you've ever had. From using Wham!'s ""Wake me up before you go go"" to Hansel asking to call Matilda, 'Matil' many bits of comedy go missed. ""Hansel, he's so hot right now"""
3,"So absurb, you can't help but laught at the stupidity!!!","The model look, the pouting of the lips, the gasoline fight, the blank stares, the absurdity, you can't help but laugh!!! Stiller and Owen play models who hate each other and try to outdo one another. A freak accident, no, a stupid accident leave three of Stiller's model friends dead, and he realizes there is more in life then being ""really, really good looking"" and decides he wants to retire from modeling. Will Farell play a fashion designer, who wants to kill someone and he gets Stiller to do it by hypnotism. Stiller eventually notices a trend where male models are not living beyond the age of 30, and realizes he could be next in line to not make 30 if he does what he is supposed to do.The line that still gets me ""I'm bulimic"".....""You can read minds?"" Oh that is a riot!!! The movies picks fun at modeling, being a celebrity, and the movie has some wonderful cameos. This movie is simply hilarious!!!"
4,haven't laughed so hard in ages,easily the best comedy since tommy boy. loved it. if you're into 'highbrow' humour don't bother. these one star reviewers just don't get it.
3,Daft & Vain!!!,"Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is the number one male model in the world and he is a personification of daftness and vanity. He is exactly what Mugatu (Will Ferrell) wants for his new mission, which is to brainwash someone to assassinate Malaysia's Prime Minister. Zoolander is a film that actively flirts with the audience through its intentionally dim-witted comments by Zoolander and his colleagues. The film brings the audience an absurdity that raises above almost everything that has been accomplished before Zoolander. In the end, everyone should know the description for daftness and vanity."
1,the only thing laughable here is the premise,"I guess it boosted five-foot tall simian Ben Stiller's ego to play a male fashion model. Plus he got to hire his father Ben Stiller as the manager and his mother Ann Meara in the crowd scenes. An utter waste of two hours and whatever it cost to produce this turkey. The premise is retarded: Male models are superstars. Can anyone name a male model? Oh, Ben Stiller is soooo hot when he pouts. Jokes? Story? Hundreds of good stories out there, dozens of funny comedians, talented directors, beautiful actors and actresses, and THIS is what Hollywood churns out. Crap from beginning to end."
1,Didn't laugh one time,"First off, it doesn't even deserve one star. This has got to be one of, if not THE worst movies I have ever seen. I did not laugh one time and could not even finish watching this awful movie. I can't imagine anyone spending money for this truly pitiful excuse for entertainment. Not only was the writing bad, but it was one product placement after another. Was this supposed to be a movie with a message or a feature length commercial? Ben Stiller was bad and should be ashamed to have ever written the script."
1,This Movie Sucks!!,"The only reason, it gets one star is for the effort it took the director and Ben Stiller to screw up such an easy thing. Just like the Saturday Night Live of today is but a shadow of the great old shows of 10-15 years ago, this movie is entirely flawed in its premise. We left the Theatre after about 10 minutes and Ben Stillers attempt at having some sort of an accent was pathetic. The cast members from SNL can always be counted on to be completely unfunny and lame (see ""Corky Romano"", another failure), but unfortunately Ben Stiller, whose career was looking up for once, now has to deal with the fallout of this movie disaster. Jeeeez, come on folks!"
2,Save your money.,"It's a sad day when a Keanu Reeves movie blows a Ben Stiller flick out of the water. While there were some funny spots, the movie overall was hard to get into, shallow, not quite funny enough. And I'm usually pretty happy to sit back and ""suspend belief"" for the sake of entertainment but found myself wondering when this would be over. I'd skip this flick if I had to do it again.What I considered funny as hell:Rush Hour 2, American Pie 2, and Rat Race. Harball was a good movie as well.Kowalski Pro-Wrestler"
4,Funny,"This movie spoofs the modeling industry, and Wlll Ferrell does a nice job as Mugatu. Owen Wlson also does a nice job as Hansel, and this movie delivers jab after jab at the modeling/fashion industry, especially pointing out how models are required to do as they're told and spinning off that to make up a story about how models make good assassins to use to benefit the fashion industry. Ben Stiller also does a nice job in his titular role as Zoolander.Some of the scenes are especially funny, such as Zoolander's friends playing at the gas pump - I was like wtf lol. It's also funny when he tries to reconnect to his roots and goes back to his family, and what he does in the mine (he just can't shake his model training) as well as him and Hansel trying to infiltrate the evil agency. Overall, a very enjoyable film."
3,Overrated,"The laughs wear out quickly; it gets off to a good start with Stiller's preening/pouting model shtick but that same gag gets milked ruthlessly for the next ninety minutes. Jerry Stiller and Will Ferrell are good in supporting roles but it's far from their best stuff. People seem to compare this to ""Old School"" a lot but it's definitely not in that league, although it's okay for a goofy comedy. I'd give it two and-a-half stars if I could. A bad cameo by the totally useless Paris Hilton drags it down a half star at least."
2,Zoolander?,"More like Snoozlander. Nothing funny here, folks. Move along. I have 11 more words but I honestly can't think of a way to fill them as this movie was as vapid as the industry it tries to make fun of."
5,Ben Stiller's Best Yet,This is totally one of my favorite movies of 2001. I have not laughed this much in a long time... =D
2,"Children, cover your eyes up??","Zoolander, starring Ben Stiller. After seeing Meet the Parents I had high hopes for this film. Meet the Parents was a hilarious comedy in which Ben Stiller performed astoundingly. In Zoolander, the movie had it's funny parts, but, during scenes such as the massage parlor seen, is this really appropraite for some kids who will see this movie? Some kids that see it that are 10 or so that are allowed to see PG-13 movies because they are ""not that bad"" might not even know what is going on in this part. Although this movie was overall, a good movie, I do not suggest children in 6 or 7th grade and under to see this film."
2,Funny for a while....,"Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), the greatest male model in the world, teams up with his archrival Hansel (Owen Wilson) to foil an assassination plot against the Malaysian foreign minister for planning to abolish child labor. This film takes some effective digs at the fatuity and insipidness of the fashion industry and its dependance on underpaid labor, and Stiller and Wilson are terrific, but this is essentially a one-joke film and the joke wears thin pretty quick. Wil Ferrell does a great job as the evil fashion magnate Mugatu. I'm waiting for the breakout role that will make him a star."
4,Welllll!,"Surprisingly very funny. Completely stupid in many ways, but that's the whole point. Quite well written, and greatly helped by the comedic timing of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, two very funny actors with great careers ahead of them. Cameos from people like Milla Jovovich and David Bowie add to the fun. Mostly though, Zoolander's great because it's funny without being particularly mean, it gives you a group of appealing characters and takes you along for the ride."
2,Confused satire,"This is colourful but lightweight satire on the inanity of the fashion industry and male models in particular. Unfortunatley the makers apparently regard the film's audience as itself lacking critical faculties and intelligence, so the satire is obvious and inane rather like, um.... the notional male model."
4,So ridiculous it's funny...,"This directorial debut for film funny-man Ben Stiller is so stupid, so goofy, so outrageous that it's incredibly hilarious. At some points, I was laughing so hard my side hurt. But take warning: some of the jokes are somewhat offensive. Roger Ebert gave this movie a one-star because he didn't like the fact that the plot centered around the assassination of a world leader from Malaysia. What Ebert failed to understand is that the movie doesn't want to be taken seriously at all! Cool it, Ebert! It's just a joke! Ben Stiller is constantly hilarious as our hero, Derek Zoolander, a male model with ""3% bodyfat, 1% brain activity."" It you like this kind of stuff (which I do) this movie is right up your alley. But if you get offended when the bad guy wants to kill a world leader, go see some Disney movie."
1,Perhaps the worst movie of all time!!,"I only give this movie 1 star because I couldn't give less. Don't expect anything to laugh at in this one. Despite the all star comedic cast, this movie did not make me laugh even once. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
3,Sporadically entertaining,"The Bottom Line:Zoolander is somehow considered something of a ""classic"" comedy when in fact it's a slight, inoffensively bland piece of filmmaking that offers up the occasional chuckle alongside long periods of blah; the title character is funny enough but Will Ferrell's villain is stupid and the movie never really gets you rolling in the aisles, let alone keep you there.2.5/4"
1,"nice try, but sorry ben.....","ben, you were pretty funny in 'mary', ok in 'meet the parents', but this one just doesnt do anything. sorry man, youre a comedian, not a director, or is it the other way around? cuz, ben you werent funny at all in this flick. this was just plain bad. the funniest part was.....wait a minute, i dont even think there was a funny part....."
1,not worth your time,this is one of the worst movie i have ever seen save you maoney and rent or buy something better. ben stillers worst movie. its hard to really say how bad it is
2,Zoo-rubbish-lander.,I really like Ben Stiller which is why I was so disappointed when I saw this movie. Ben Stiller is brainwashed by Will Ferrell to kill the president of Korea and the movie is about all the twists and turns as the day approaches. Owen Wilson is quite funny and I also loved the cameo's by Jon Voght and Vince Vaugh. But the whole plot and story are so lame. I think this is a good movie for over 13 but under 21 in my opinion.
1,Why do people think this movie is funny?,"I have trouble finding any humor in ""Zoolander"". It almost annoys me that people actually find this cheezy drivel funny! Although I am a Ben Stiller fan from his work in ""Meet the Parents"" and ""There's Something About Mary,"" this is by far his LEAST funny comedy. ""Zoolander"" gets 1 star only because there isn't a 0 star option. I know I sound like I'm ranting but trust me, do yourself a favor and never see this movie."
3,"NEW LOOK, NEW GREAT MOVIE","Zoolander is a great movie.But i must say, i expected something else.But it stills very funny and original.You have to see this blockbuster.Ben Stiller also directed this film, he's doing great jobs, like ""Meet the parents"", ""There's something about Mary"".Listen to me, and go now to see it.One thing I didn't like was that it's a little stupid, but it's OK."
3,Funny Film and very creative,"Funny i laughed and laughed, but i gave it a somewhat harsh score for its cheesy ability to make me laugh and some scenes that make you realize its a lame movie, i loved it, but it was lame, cheesy... Some people won't undersatnd that until they see it... its absolutely hilarious and my friends and i quote it all the time and jove it like the classic ""You can read minds?"" Well, thats a cruel but funny scene... I suggest see it and possibly buy it like i did but be prepared to have mixed feelings...***/*****3 out of 5"
3,Limited Appeal,"If you are a dedicated follower of fashion, Zoolander might be of special interest to you. Die Hard Ben Stiller fans might appreciate this as well. However, the rest of us will find this as a middle of the road comedy that plays off the joke that models are self absorbed and quite stupid.I will admit that Ben Stiller's facial expressions and speech patterns are quite comical. The pacing is pretty decent and the gasoline fight scene is totally off the wall. However the cyber effects get a bit annoying after a while.Try something else by Ben Stiller as the laugh appeal is limited."
2,mystery men was even funnier,"i didn't really expect much from this one to begin with but it was worse than i expected.the whole plot was stupid(an incompatant model brainwashed to kill a world leader)i expected it to be a little weird but they to the whole model thing to far.i guess that was there idea from the begining,but it didnt work it was just to over the top.however their were some funny parts in the movie they were to few and far between.if you seen mystery men and kinda liked it you make find this a little entertaining,but if you didn't like mystery men then you will probbaly hate this one.I really like Ben Stiller and i think he's got alot of talent but he needs to slowdown with the weird themes for his movies.he movies.rent it (maybe)"
4,Don't miss this movie on DVD,"Too many reviews already so let me add just a few things. I was glad I picked this movie after a long day at work, not only it cracked me up every 5 minutes or so, it also helped me look back at the ""serious"" things I had to deal with during the day and laugh them all off. The miscommunications and linguistic twists were hilarious, and trying to spot all the cameos was fun too. One last thing: Don't miss ""Zoolander"" on DVD. I really enjoyed the special features. One of my favorite scenes must be the dialogue between Winona Ryder and Owen Wilson (the ""Aliens"" referral - LOL). Too bad it was deleted from the main feature."
4,Oh Come Off It - It's Great Fun!,"Note well that this movie will not be up against Dude, Where's My Car (joking) at the Oscars. It basically has a ridiculous plot which is an excuse for some of the years best laughs. Hilarious satire on the fashion and modelling world, with a few good gay, eating disorder and erection jokes thrown in for good measure. ""Blue Steel"" cracked up the whole cinema every time - as did his phone.....his baby....his friends....his equally stupid rival, Haarrn-zon and so on and so foth. Try to pick out all the cameos. You'll love it. Trust me. These other dodgy reviewers here are just over-the-hill prudes who miss their Casablanca."
5,Sit down with an Orange Mocha Frappucino and enjoy this,"This movie is a classic. It's a very zany comedy, don't expect it to get serious for even one second. Besides the hilariously funny scenes such as the gasoline fight, the model ""walkoff"", the brainwashing scene, and the orgy, there are a lot of more subtle jokes that you can miss if you're not paying attention. This is definitely a movie you need to watch at least twice in order to catch everything. Every scene with Will Ferrell and his look-alike poodle is great."
2,Zoolander,"The mother of all stupid-funny movies. Directed, produced and co-written by Ben Stiller, this is a movie for everyone(everyone who has time to watch a film this stupid). It's a shame this is what comedies are coming to these days. Full of dumb humor and bad acting, it's fun for the whole family. It just seems that good old funny movies are going down hill."
2,Stupid and not funny enough,"I liked some of the recent stupid-funny movies, so I gave this one a look. I think I laughed maybe 8-10 times. I smiled once in a while. It started slow and seemed disconnected often, like jokes with a story trying to tie them together. The scene where Derek Zoolander has to hide out with his friend is so irrelevent to moving the story-line. The implied sex in that scene is also a waste. I ""got"" the spoofing. It just wasn't all that funny. It is a shame, because I really like Ben Stiller."
4,Zoolander: A Stupid Movie - Duh!?!?!,"This movie is a classic. For those who say it is dumb, well maybe the joke is on you. Thats the entire premise of the film -to poke fun at people who think they are smart and live off of the obvious.Quite frankly I can watch this movie on loop and never get board. While Zoolander is great, its Owen Wilson as ""Hansel"" that makes this movie spin. ""Don't you know I'm loco?"" Is quite possibly the funniest moment in the movie.So quit taking yourselves so seriously. This movie makes you laugh if and only if you are open to it."
3,FAIR TO MIDDLING,"This movie is not great. It's not bad either. It's just O.K.. After listening to the commentary, I bet that's Stillers' opinion also. He states that many gags seemed to work when writing the script but did not translate well in the movie. You can tell by his voice that it bothers him.The part of this DVD that works the best is the menu. Each section starts with Derek giving us innane instructions. I also enjoyed the freeze-frame, cubist, color morphing on the main section. If only the rest of the movie had been as fresh and original as the menu."
2,Ooooh...,"...I didnt want to like this movie. However, given the offal that I mistakenly rent on a weekly basis, I was not driven to shower or puke after watching it. No belly laughs, but a few guffaws. Though the star is not a SNL member, it is an SNL movie more or less...Certainly better than the worst movie Ive seen in I dont know how long, ""The Ladies Man"", but definitely not Ben Stiller's finest moment. Chock full of meaningless cameos as well..."
5,Funniest Movie,This is one of the funnies movies i have seen in a long time. IT is so funny because of the stuppidity and the way they demonstrate models. Keeps you laughing the whole time especially teh gasoline fight. Awesome dvd for teens at a party.
1,Good Movie but!!!!!!!!!!,I love this movie the only problem was I received it and it was defective it skipped never played and I contacted the company I bought it from and They never contacted me back it took forever to get my refund! Note to others buy anything off of Amazon get it straight from them never buy from an unknown company don't buy from The Good Company they have bad customer service and as far as I'm concerned are real con artist I don't trust them so take my word for it!:)
5,best movie,"i love this movieif u are lookin to buy it do so right now""the files are IN the computer""haha"
3,Like a Strange Dream,"This film is so bizarre, it's like Will Ferrell's character asks at one point, ""Am I taking crazy pills?!"" Very funny, but see it with friends and a beer or two."
4,..... Blue Steel....,"This movie delivered what it promised...a funny and stupid comedy. Ben couldn't have done a better impression of a male model, I am a huge fan of ""BLUE STEEL"". I think that Ben Stiller really is a wonderful comedic actor, he is so funny. Will Farrell is awesome in this movie. He was very over the top, and unexpected. Coming into this movie don't expect Oscar worthy material, nor should you expect goofball humor. The characters ability to keep straight faces through out the movie amazes me. It shows their true talent as actors. Definitely a must see."
4,If you don't like it.....watch it again.,"This movie grows on you. I thought it was just ok the first time, but upon further review I thought it was hilarious. Watch out for the gas station scene and the walk-off among others. Ben Stiller's facial expressions are classic and I find that Owen Wilson is always an excellent sidekick."
5,Best Movie Ever!,Funny! Lots of funny lines. Stupid humor throughout. LOTS of cameo appearances. The entire premise is so silly. Laughed til I cried and then laughed some more til my stomach hurt!
5,zoolander,"Best movie of all time! The Yagoogily is the best part of the movie, a must see and watch movie!"
5,Funny Movie,I love this movie. It is so funny and Ben Stiller is just incredible. Great great movie if you are in need of a pick me up.
1,Ooookaaaaay!,"This movie is terrible . I see it on showtime , see it coming on, see Ben Stiller so I sit and watch and...its too stupid . Not funny stupid but stupid stupid! Makes me wanna punch the tv"
2,OHmigdawd Ben Stiller is incredible....,".....at playing the same character in every movie! Hey, hear Ben talk softly AGAIN, act stupid AGAIN, keep one eye half open AGAIN! Ben stole my money AGAIN!The only redeeming feature of this...umm..feature...is the model guys playing splish splash with the gasoline. Too bad Ben wasn't closer to them.See my other reviews if you love Ben Stiller."
1,worst waste of Hollywood dollars ever!!!!!!!,I could give a lengthy review of how God-awful this movie was but I won't because I won't give anymore time to this pukefest of a waste of time it is to begin with. Ben Stiller must have had to pay on his beach house. YUCK! total drek!
3,Zany,"This movie, starring Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson, is a parody of the fashion industry. In fact, quite a few fashion personalities appear in this movie. I was particularly surprised to see an appearance by David Bowie. This movie basically has just one joke: fashion models are ignorant and self-absorbed. The first few times you see it, it's really funny, but after a while it gets old, and you wish there was a little more variety in the jokes. Ben Stiller does a good job as the wacky model, Derek Zoolander. However, I found Luke Wilson's performance a little too irritating. He just whines and whines with his nasal voice.If you're interested in fashion, you'll probably like this movie. If you're not, you may not be able to get all the jokes. Of course if you're a fan of Ben Stiller, you should check it out, but if you're not, then you could probably pass on this one."
1,you must be drunk to make this movie tolerable,"You gotta be drunk my wife wasn't and suffered through it, it was only bearable to watch because my buddies and I were drinking throughout it the whole time. this is the stupidest movie ever and probably is what caused us to drink so much to dull the torture of this movie. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE"
2,booring and too silly to be funny...........save your money!,"i was excited to see this movie and spent 30.00 to take 4 people to see zoolander! wow, what a waste of time and money. ben stiller wasnt himself as he was in ""meet the parents"" and it seems the movie was trying to rip off austin powers (funny movie) the only problem is that ben stiller isnt mike myers! ben, stick with what you did in ""meet the parents"" and ""something about mary"" because this zoolander thing just isnt for you or your audience......."
2,Really Really Really Good Looking and Rather Dumb,"Zoolander is basically good for a few chuckles, but I have no idea how it has a 4 star rating right now."
2,Horrible,"Why do they even bother producing movies like this? Terrible plot, not funny - tries too hard. Don't waste your time."
4,Classic Ben Stiller film,"Great fun film I love renting from Amazon its the best great competitive prices and good quality.This is one of our favorite family things to do on a week night rent a movie from amazon and just chill. ""Thanks Amazon"""
5,Hansel. So hot right now. Hansel.,"This movie is sooo ridiculously stupid that it's funny, and I can't believe Jerry Stiller is Ben Stiller's dad. Weirdest father and son movie ever made."
5,Earth to Brint...,"everyone i know (w/ few exceptions) absolutely adores this movie. you have to laugh at it instead of thinking 'whats the point of this story?' its definitely a great movie that anyone who liked robin hood men in tights or o brother where art thou (et cetera) would love. of course, maybe you'd like it anyway w/o liking those other films. anyhoo, this is a great movie in which me and my friends cannot stop quoting from. very hilarious, very awesome. can u say orange mocha frappiccino?"
5,"Really, Really, Really, Ridiculously Good Looking Movie","From the dangers of gasoline fights to brainwashing a la Clockwork Orange to aborigones as models getting a piece of their soul stolen each time they are photographed, this is a very, very funny movie - certainly one of Ben Stiller's best (perhaps not quite as good as Something About Mary).This was a case of turning what was essentially a one-time Saturday Night Live skit (in fact it was a VH-1 skit) and turning it into a full length motion picture. Unlike most attempts at doing this, this attempt worked and worked well."
5,A funny satire on fashion models!!!,This is a funny satire comedy. Stiller and Wilson are a funny clash together. The DVD is loaded with lots of features. This is one of those comedys that you can watch over and over.
5,What's wrong with comedies,"People always say comedies are stupid, pointless etc. The reason comedies are funny is because they are stupid and outrageous. This is an extremely funny movie, perhaps not for old people but just get yourself a sense of humour and enjoy."
3,Knew what I was getting into,I didn't see this movie expecting to see Academy Award winning performances. Parts were very funny and the non-funny parts will still probably grow on me.
4,It all about the face.,"The move is about two super models. Ben's charator starts the movie by going to an award sarimony for best male model. After four years he loses to the other guy. After that he starts thinking about life. He goes to a gas station and his friends have a gasoline fight. They die, but not Ben. The movie moves on and Ben keeps make his specil face. It's funny because it almost seems true how model are. Pretty and stupid. If nothing else, see it to see how many famus people you recognize."
1,will not work in my zone,"I was very dissapointed because I could not get it to show in my zone, therefore I had to order it from barnes and nobles. ordering this dvd from your company and not able to see it, have given me some reserve. thanks"
2,Soooo NOT funny!,"I don't see what all of the rave reviews are about. 2 Stars is really being too kind. This movie was not funny at all. All else aside, I can't stand Ben Stiller. He is not funny period. I don't know what I was thinking when I watched this movie because it was a total waste of time."
4,it's so simple...,"remember when this movie came out and no one liked it? that was funny.just another example of how people can be stupid. listen to your friend billy zane, he's a cool dude."
3,Ben Stiller very over-rated,"Ben Stiller may be the flavour of the moment, but he is definitely over-rated in my opinion. I finally saw ""Zoolander"" after avoiding it for some time. Granted, there were a few funny moments (eg. Merman) but this film is really aimed at people who have the lowest IQ. Ben Stiller acts the same in all his films, so it was no surprise to me to find that he acted the same in Zoolander. Same facial expressions etc etc.I think I'll stick to films where actors work hard at their craft."
1,more garbage from Hollywood,"I remenber when movies were good. Now, at 25, I realize that Hollywood has just stopped trying, and is in the business purely for the money. Zoolander is categorized as a comedy, but I wasn't laughing. It is probably funny for kids under eleven years old, what with all the urination jokes and non-material characters. Ben Stiller was funny in meet the parents, but this movie is boring and too predictable. It [stinks], so be advised to keep far away from this waste of time that further enriches Hollywood and its constantly falling standards of quality."
1,TERRIBLE,This movie was by far the worst Ben Stiller movie EVER. The movie was not even stupid funny. I never laughed through the whole thing. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. To sum it up in one word it's simply terrible
4,Hillarious,"Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson team up for this very funny, very original film that pokes fun of today's fashion industry, based on a VH1 Fashion show. Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, an international Male Supermodel who is brain washed into attempting to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Accompanied by Will Ferrell, this film has a good screenplay and great comedic acting. A must have for Stiller and Wilson fans."
2,TWO AND A HALF STARS,"This movie is mostly just downright stupid and takes half an hour to get any good. Depending on your sense of humor you may find it hilarious to see Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson strutting and preening like a couple of peacocks and some of the movie actuallly is pretty funny, but I found it mostly embarrassing;I guess it all comes down to personal preference. However there are lots of cameo appearances (everyone from Donald Trump to Madonna) which may maintain your interest.Though if the phrase ""stupid is as stupid does"" sums up your personality, then you'll probably love this."
2,"I love Ben Stiller, but...","There were some funny parts, but not really worth the money I spent to rent it. Don't get me wrong, I love Ben Stiller, but this movie didn't bring out his true comedic talents. It kinda seemed to me like he was trying to make his own Austin Powers. That's just my opinion. The idea of the movie is funny, and it did make me laugh at some points, but Ben Stiller can do so much better. Sorry Ben!"
4,Noy's pick,Well i thought the movie was funny. The best part of the movie was when Tyson Beckford was on. Ben Stiller is a very funny man.
5,How can we teach the students if they can't even fit in the,"This has to be one of the funniest films ever made. It is packed with today's hottest stars...Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell.Zoolander (Stiller) is the hot model but this year he is going to get knocked off his pedestal by Hanzel (Wilson) and Mugatu feels this is his chance to take over the model world by using Zoolander to kill models. It is hilarious and a great laugh anytime you need one. It is a movie that never gets tiring! Just remember for those watching this is more of a slapstick comedy a play on words and such not a serious comedy in any way!"
4,Robin Williamson - Master of the Celtic Harp,"Anyone who has enjoyed one of Robin Williamson's solo concerts recently will need little persuasion to buy this album: Robin, always a multi-talented player, has grown into a true master of one of the world's loveliest intruments: the celtic harp. His playing has none of the cold perfection of the classically trained musician - his technique is superb but what makes this music so special is that it has heart, and soul, and guts. Robin is a storyteller by nature and each of these pieces tells stories of their own. As the title makes plain, some are nimbly-skipping dance tunes while others are more reflective, meditative ""airs"", but all are full of light, colour and movement. This is music to soothe the spirit and make all things well."
3,It's a mirror,It's an after market mirror! It does not come with back mounting plate. Otherwise it is just as the description implies. May not be safety glass.
3,Exact same as the Apple Airport Card (802.11b),"For the money, you Vaio users should just get an Apple airport card. They are the exact same card... just so you know. Also, Apple and their resellers sold them much cheaper than Sony ever did."
2,Three Strangers,"This movie was not what I had expected, I thought a Greenstreet , Lorre movie HAD to be good, WRONG"
3,too many typos,"The book is a good effort on a fairly esoteric subject, clearly organized and reasonably (though not always thoroughly) explained. However, there are a lot of typos and the sql code examples were often not quite correct. A second edition, which needn't involve major revision, would be most welcome!"
1,Poor quality cleats,"I ordered this shoe and they were worn during one softball tournament. The toe tore completely out, the rivets in the bottom of the toe wore down. Don't waste your money on these cleats."
3,Erudite and unusual,"This novel is about a man and woman hunting for sunken treasure of gold. The style is a bit abstruse and intellectual, and is not intented for mass audiences. Yet if you pay attention and are persistent, you will find lots of witty lines and some rather poetic phrasings. It is a very unusual book ... the best comparisons I can think of are Fowles' ""The Magus"" or Umberto Eco's stuff. And maybe John Barth. Stick with it, the ending will surprise you."
2,Junk at a high price,"I bought 2, not at the same time,the 1st one, the belt clip broke, and BOTH LCD screens didnt work when it got hot outside, meaning upper 80s.they both sit in my bag with all the other junk i bought.i would not buy it again, not worth it. my gps has scoring built in.i just have to keep up with the times..."
2,Rip Off,"I received this as a gift after including it on my Amazon gift list. While it seems to be somewhat handy, you don't really get the benefit of what it does without additional software and Amazon does not give you this information. You only find out about it when you get the product. When you try to find the software and computer attachment no one has it and it will be a long time before it is available. At $50 this is over rated and not presented as what it is. I would be very careful before I ever bought another item that was produced by this company. When I called the company itself (#from the website)I got a private #, the person was barely understandable and informed me that it would be a long time if the software and computer attachment would be availble."
1,Dead on arrival,Dead on arrival. There is no on/off switch. You connect/disconnect the power cord for on/off. Maybe I just got a bad unit. I opted for a refund so I can't tell you how a working one performs.
2,Seemed like a good drive until it stopped working,"I was excited to have the extra capacity but frustrated at the lack of an on/off switch. I really think that is a problem they need to address.... The drive seemed to work fine for a few days, then made a series of loud grinding noises and died. I don't know for a fact but I suspect the lack of an on / off switch had a part in the ultimate failure of the drive. Also, it would have been helpful if the CD that came with it had some software to reformat or otherwise try to diagnose and repair."
3,reboot error,its a good drive if you dont mind disconnecting it every time you boot up the computer or reboot otherwise if its connected - the system will keep rebooting until you unplug it
5,Mail in rebates,I think these mail in rebates are the worst things in the world. Why would you buy from a manufacturer and then have to wait for a rebate. These rebates turn me off to the product.
5,Victory When All Hell Breaks Loose,"It's hard to forget the image when you turn on the news and see a mass shooting like the ones at Columbine High School or at the Jewish community center in Los Angeles. But, when you see it happen in your own community and in a church of your denomination, it makes it far worse. Dan Crawford does an excellent job over more than 375 pages detailing not only the destruction that Satan wrought on God's house at Wedgwood Baptist Church, but more importantly, shows the victory that only God is capable of providing. There are points where I got very angry, points where I cried, but at the end, I was reminded that Satan has already been defeated and our Lord has the victory. That's the true story of Sept. 15, 1999."
4,Pyramid PS21KX 20 Amp power supply,This is a well made heavy duty 12 volt power supply that works great to power several specialized battery chargers I use with batteries in radio controlled model airplanes and transmitters.I am happy with the purchase and the quick delivery on an international order.
5,Very sturdy made product,"This is a very sturdy made product you can tell it's made to last,it's not a cheap piece of trash you see when you by a lot of things. I was very impressed when I received this power supply and I'm still impressed after using it for a while now."
1,Bought 4 - 3 of them broke the first day,Bought 4 - 3 of them broke the first day.I would NOT consider this brand if you need a 12 volt power supply.
5,Love it!!!,Excellent Product! Bought this as a source for my iMax Quattro B6 charger. It allows me to charge 4 different 3700 mah 3 cell lipos without any problems at all. Doesn't make much noise even when fan is on. I wish I'd bought it years ago.
5,"Hilarious, smart read","Love, love, love this book. It is clever, funny, touching and brilliantly written. I miss Gillian now that I have finished the book, and so many of the other colorful characters made their way into my heart. Will be recommending this to everyone. An absolute delight."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","I was introduced to this great album when my daughter's highland teacher used ""Pinch of Snuff"" for a choreography (think Highland goes line dancing, cowboy hats and all. It worked fabulously thanks to the Amoebas). This disc was the most wonderful thing I'd heard since disocovering Capercaille. The arrangements are fresh, eclectic and imaginative. I would love to know who ""Miss Stewart"" is. She must be one hot gal to have inspired such a great tune. Definitely need to get the rest of the TA collection."
3,Bagpipes will never be the same again,The Tartan Amoebas bringing your the funkiest renderings of the sounds of Scotland ever digitally immortalised. The Blues Brothers meet Braveheart in the opening 'Funky Bagpipies'. The rest is composed of traditional tunes delivered with a great brass section. When the Amoeabas put on a thrash at the Edinburgh Festival it's Brigadoon on speed !
3,JDLs bubblegum pop years,"This is a selection of John's early commercial successes and as such a good example of the bubble-gum pop genre. However as a collection of JDL material it is not as good as the other CDs in this series in my opinion. Collectors only I fear, but for them(including me!) it is great just to have this stuff available on CD after all these years."
5,A must have for an astrologer to have in their library,"If you use Quincunxes (Inconjuncts) and Yods in your practice of astrology this is an invaluable tool! It is especially interesting regarding Yods in synastry and transits, which are covered in here. I do think having an understanding of the fundamentals of astrology prior to reading this book might prove more fruitful; but the book is explanatory enough that you could probably follow most of it as a beginner as well."
2,Surprisngly mediocre,"This ought to be a great set of CD's -- good music, good artists -- and yet over a couple of listenings my wife and I both had the same reaction: boring. We are normally fans of any number of the performers (Norah Jones, Medeleine Peyroux, Diana Krall), but even their tracks seemed lifeless. I don't know if the selections was faulty (were these rejected tracks?) or if there was something about the engineering that produced a flat, lifeless effect. In any event, we found it disappointing."
5,Quality,"This is a good quality, fun game. Just what I was looking for. Arrived quickly, and was well packaged. Great purchase!"
3,Broken,The game itself is alot of fun. We ordered two one as a gift and one to keep. The problem is they both came broken. One I glued back together and the other I sent back. The good thing was it was very easy to send back and get a refund.
4,"Not a deluxe model, but it does the job","Just a basic built game, fun to play. Thought it might be of a better quality, but I will keep it."
3,Good for the price,"The game was a little smaller than I expected, but it was made of wood and seemed solid and durable. It worked as advertised, I just had been hoping for something a little more challenging to play."
5,Garment bag for wedding,"We really needed a garment bag for our daughter's wedding dress and the bridesmaids. It worked really well for us. I wish it would of been a little longer, but, If I would of had different hangars it would of made the dresses fit better lengthwise. Nice price and came really fast. Protection was what we were after and now that the wedding is over, the dresses still stay in there till there are cleaned, then I think we will put them back in there for safekeeping."
1,Doesn't even work with my wife's computer,"I was so excited to buy this as a gift for my wife, who is a teacher, so she could easily enter student grades from her laptop (a brand new Dell Inspiron). However, the software that came with the mouse wouldn't run on her laptop and the mouse wasn't recognized by the laptop for data entry purposes. Maybe there's a patch for it or some software that will make it work, but as it is the device is completely useless."
2,Business Use,"I purchased this item to use for data entry purposes. For starters the actual wire that is attached with this product for USB attachment, is extremly short for a desktop or a laptop. This is a good concept, but i would rather invest in a wireless numeric keypad w/ optical mouse rather than a wired."
1,I feel cheated!,"I was having a problem with this mixer shaking when I was making dough for my sticky buns, so I called customer service. They told me that this mixer can't hold more than 6 cups of ingredients if you are using a specialty flour, aka bread flour. Well this just sucks! I bought this machine to be able to make any delicious thing I could think of and now they tell me their mixer can't handle my flour! And apparently you aren't advised to use anything above speed 2 when mixing dough. What about when my recipe calls for medium speed??? This is total b.s and I feel cheated! I had a great experience with the seller and up until this point I loved my machine. I would have been better off looking for a better stand mixer!"
5,Great Mixer,"I received this pink Kitchenaid mixer for my first Mother's Day. I love it. It does everything and more, not to mention that it is pretty too. I've been wanting one for about a year and my husband decided that it would be my mother's day gift. I love it and he did really good this time. I recommend that anyone that bakes get one of these. I will never use a hand mixer again. I'm spoiled!"
5,Why did I wait so long?,"I got this as a birthday present. It was one of those products that I had been drooling over for over 10 years but didn't ever buy because I lived in small apartments and didn't have the space, and couldn't justify the investment when I lived on my own and was cooking for one. My dreams came true in October when I received this gift as a present. It's amazing and works so well. Did I mention its a pretty sexy piece of machinery? Works flawlessly and has been used to make bread, mash potatoes, make cookies etc... the only thing I can say that's negative is that I am making more cookies... which means I'm also eating more cookies. (ha) I only wish it was easier to figure out which attachments fit this model on amazon."
5,We love it!,I got this for my wife for mother's day several years ago and she absolutely loves it! It works perfectly and we use it all the time. Makes baking super fast.
1,Stopped working after 3 times!,"One of my old roommates used to own a 15-year-old KitchenAid mixer that he inherited from his parents. It worked like magic. After I moved out, I saved up to buy one of my own. When it came, I made French bread twice in two weeks. It worked amazingly.On its third run on the third week, the mixer stopped working while it was kneading bread dough. It just kind of got stuck in the dough and couldn't push through the dough's resistance. The motor still seemed to be working, but instead of turning the dough hook (which stayed dead still), the motor kept making unbearably loud and obnoxious noises. It still didn't work when I dislodged the bit from the dough, too. I am so disappointed. I understand breaking down after 4-5 years, but seriously? 3 weeks?I might try to purchase another one from elsewhere and see how that goes. FYI, the same mixer (in the same pink color) is $50 cheaper at Williams-Sonoma website."
4,KitchenAid Mixer,"I am very happy with the product I purchased. I am disappointed that the price of the product fluctuates so much from day to day. The day after I purchased the product at around $285, I was back on your website and it was listed at $269. I feel like I was cheated out of $15+ dollars. Why does this happen? It has made me question whether I want to do business with you in the future. Anyways, that's my feedback, I hope you can use this to ensure that you don't disappoint any future customers you may get."
5,Wonderful and the perfect color,I have been mixing things by hand and making breads by hands--I herniated some discs in my neck and then that was not so easy the solution this mixer...and I love pink..and a portion of the proceeds go to research breast cancer and find a cure. :)
5,Whoo-hoo!,"I ordered this pink model for my daughter, and she LOVES it!! I have had my Kitchenaid mixer for 30+ years, so I know she'll have it to enjoy and use forever. If she's happy, then I'm happy too!"
4,Good product,"Great product, wife loves the color, all positive except for two things. Darn thing weighs a bit so it stays out on the countertop. The bowl is nice, but she didn't like it. Two narrow of an opening at the top to pour or stir. I got her a clear bowl that was a bit smaller and she loves it."
5,Awesome!,A commercial quality product in a small package. I love the power and ease of use and the easy clean up too.
5,KitchenAid KSM150PSPK Komen Foundation Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer.,"KitchenAid KSM150PSPK Komen Foundation Artisan Series 5-Quart Mixer.is a powerful, well balanced tool. It replaces our 30 year ols mixer."
2,Seemed too good,"Bought this as a Christmas gift. Seemed miles below the other models in price, and all the reviews seemed encouraging. Bought one for my boyfriend and it died by April. Just after the 90-day warrenty was over. He has gotten it to limp along, but now there are alot of models for the same or lower price. Wish I had waited."
4,"DVD+R, DVD+RW","Bought this DVD player since reviewers said that it plays DVD+R and DVD+RW. Tried all my DVD+R discs and it rejected all of them - went from LOADING to NO DISC. Looks like it DOES NOT play DVD/R,RW discs.Also noted that it does not have a switch for video/audio inputs. Can't hook up any external devices like PS2/Xbox/Gamecube if you want to use it for gaming.Since missing audio/video inputs, gave it 4 stars.Called Inital before deciding to return player and it seems that only Memorex DVD-R's play according to them. I tried a Verbatim DVD-R and it worked.Looks like only DVD-R format is supported so beware if you only have a DVD+R burner."
4,Wonderful Frequent Flier Companion.,"I bought this December '02 to use on a long flight. It worked beautifully. It comes with a remote control,ac adapter,cigarette lighter adapter, battery and charger (charge lasts approx. 2 1/2 hours of video dvd's or much longer for just audio cd's).It has yet to reject any of the media I have asked it to play including cd-r's cd-rw's and dvd-r's. It comes with a remote, but with the personal screen size I tend to use the handy buttons on the console to access functions.Update:I was so pleased with this product, I recently upgraded to the 7"" model and passed on this one to a family member since it still looks and works like new!"
4,DVD-R's work with player,"Called Inital before returning player and they stated that Memorex DVD-R's work with the player. Made a DVD-R disc(Verbatim brand) and it worked!Seems that only DVD-R format is supported by the player. Please note, as I stated in my earlier review, that DVD+R's do NOT work with this player.Gave them a higher rating of 4 since it does play DVD-R formatted discs."
2,Not recommendable,Product was defective after a month! Could have been informed about the defect. I tried ways and means to repair but to no avail.
2,The glitch,"When in play this product just stops playing (still picture) if you tap on the disc cover it will restart the DVD but not in the same place. Very bad business, But I guess you get what you pay for!!!!!!!!!"
2,Think before you buy.,"Got this item hoping that I could use it to kill some waiting time when I travel. Worked great with need to improve sounds in the beginning. After 1 month of usage, the player started to have problem playing the new DVDs I bought, and the controls on the player itself also failed to work. My friend also bought the same item, her player was ok. Think this brand may have some sort of internal quality control problem on their items. My suggestion is to buy from a brand that you have heard of for things like this. Repair is also a problem. I went back to the store where I picked up the player. Was told that I should contact the manufacturer, but their Initial's contact information was no where to be found on the box, the instruction manual, or anywhere."
4,excellent resource for the homiletics student,"This book is an excellent resource for everyone who is involved in the delivery of sermons. Young preachers can develop a good habit by following the recommended steps in their development of first-person narrative sermons. The steps described are useful analytical tools for narrative passages. Hence, even if the sermon method employed ends up not being a first-person approach, the sermon preparation can still benefit from the analytical tools described in this book. Seasoned preachers looking for a fresh way of preaching narratives can also benefit from this book by understanding more about first-person preaching."
3,Did not get all of what I ordered,"The book did not come with the CD-ROM that was promised in the product description ""The book includes a CD-ROM with a video sample of first-person narrative preaching.""Not sure why I had to pay the amount I did when I received half of what was promised."
5,Great Advice for Parents!,Good advice from this DVD. Good tips and instruction for new and old parents. I practice some of these tips myself and they do wonders with the kids!
5,Great info for all parents,"As with all of Jef Gazley's works, this DVD gives practical advice within a framework of child/human development. This helps understand why kids do what they do. The conscious parent can then guide the child's healthy emotional development process while improving unwanted behavior."
1,Sound quality,"The sound quality was bad. I ordered 3 movies though amazon instant watch, and the sound quality sucked. I will not purchase fr amazon anymore."
4,Serious Research,"The older I get. the more I realize that the only history that really counts is ""useable history"". Readers want to know how history touches them. They want to know the people, places and ideas close to them. That is a start. Krick gives us a genealogical smorgasbord of the best and brightest young men of the southern states during the Civil War. Do you want to understand the Confederacy? Flip through this book and see that excellent minds served the South as well as the North. This is a deeply researched, unbiased presentation of facts that will help both genealogists and Civil War historians for decades to come."
4,"Excellent effort, but I wish it had an index","This is an impressive and useful book. Mr. Krick's efforts to compile information regarding the staff officers of the Army of Northern Virginia are thorough and explanatory. However, I am left wanting an index, so that I would be able to search for specific Regiments, as I am currently doing regimental research."
4,Wonderful Film score by Carmine Coppola,"I was very excited to learn that this soundtrack was available on CD. I love the music to the very first picture The Black Stallion with Kelly Reno and Mickey Rooney. I especially find the Reprise Theme very moving and at times brings tears to my eyes. It is so beautiful. I still have the LP to the movie but no longer have a record player. I also have the cassette tape but the sound is warping on it. If you have not seen this movie yet I recommend that you do and once you hear the film score I think you will want to purchase this soundtrack also. I would have to say, though, that the second film score to The Black Stallion Returns is not as memorable but it is still worth the price of this CD just to listen to Carmine Coppola's music that has been out of print for quite a long time."
2,Where's the opening song?,Where's the opening song of the Bucefulus statue blowing in the windy desert?? does anyone know where i can find a recording of that song??
2,"Interesting, but outdated","The first edition of this book was in 1983; the second in 1990. Although the information on climate and agriculture is still relevant, I can guarantee the industrial sector in Japan is nowhere near where it was 20 years ago.Missing in this book, then, is information on the ""Lost Decade,"" the 1993 Kobe earthquake, the bursting of the real estate bubble in 1989, and ... (I'm trying to think of some other things) the effects of the 2002 World Cup on development. There's a lot of Japan's most modern history that's been left out.If there was an updated version of this book somewhere, I'd recommend that. Unless, of course, you want an early 80's view of Japan, in which case this one's perfect."
2,Poorly made,"We have designed most of our kitchen around the KitchenAid red. We thought in the pictures that this breadbox would match, so we bought it. It does not match that color very well but the real reason we returned it was because it was so cheaply made. It felt like it was ready to fall apart when we pulled it our of the box. The lid did not move freely. We ended up returning it and getting an all stainless box for $24.95 that was much better built and looked better."
1,Don't waste your money,This DVD sucks. It blanks out the good parts and shows 90% of nothing but boats and guys. Don't waste your money. Get the real movie and pass on this wannabe title.
4,A good getaway-style book,"My favorite book related to vacation home style is Cottage Style, and I wrote a review of that book on amazon awhile back. This Cabin Fever book is a bit narrower in scope, but I am enjoying all the photos. Because I love Better Homes and Gardens Cottage Style, I just bought the new BH&G book called Second Home, which shows one great house after another. I'm getting lots of decorating ideas from those homes. But Second Home also has great information on real estate shopping, home design, and decorating, too. It's my kind of book, because it's a dream book that also helps me do something to achieve the dream."
4,See the log cabin of your dreams....,"A great coffee table book for your house or mountain cabin! Most of these ""vacation homes"" are nicer than our regular houses. Great to curl up with this book in front of the fire."
2,A poor choice of title.,"This is a fine book if your taste in rustic dwellings tends toward the grand lodge. Because I prefer the modest true cabin over the ostentatious second home, my choice is a recent book titled ""The Cabin"" which focuses on structures of 1200 square feet or less."
4,Fun to look at,"Thanks to a previous reviewer, M. Pass, I bought this and also bought a book called Second Home. Both are great. This Cabin Fever book is limited to homes that are a bit more rustic than what we had in mind, but we still love it. Second Home also is a gorgeous dream book but it has a wider variety of home and decorating styles. Second Home also has given us a lot of information on how to shop for a retreat, how to decide what location is best for us, as well as tips on decorating and building. Second Home approaches the topic from a broader perspective."
5,Beautiful album,"Musically reminds me of the context & quality of e.g. Fairport Convention, Richard Thompson, the Waterboys, etc. Beautiful, soulful music, I wish you would do another album like this!"
4,Stirring and informative,"This is the first John Jakes novel I have read but now I feel another one coming on. I loved reading about real life characters like Lincoln, Stanton, Davis, Jackson, Booth and others. From the way the author describes Lincoln's wife I'm surprised he didn't pull the trigger himself. Lon Price is the main character. A young idealist who is dead against the slave trade. He starts working for Pinkerton and works his way up to the lofty echelons of Washington's Secret Service. We see how the story changes him from a relatively innocent optimist into a battle hardened realist. There are many other great characters and storylines in this enjoyable book. We certainly get a true picture of how ugly that era was. The book actually takes a good couple of hundred pages to really get rolling due to character development. The reward is worth it though. I was sad when it ended."
3,3 1/2 stars - Solid but hoped for more........,"With On Secret Service, an educational and often entertaining novel, Jakes has again spun a story of fiction, set against a backdrop of real-life characters and actual events. Somehow though, the story was not as compelling as the North and South trilogy or the Bicentennial series that first drew me to Jakes. It could have been the ratio of fact to fiction, which at times made this seem like non-fiction. Also since the book covered the period from pre-war to post-war, there were often gaps of time where the reader is left wondering what was happening to the various characters. This is not Jakes' best effort, but there is certainly more good than bad. Reading On Secret Service will be worth the time, especially for civil war buffs."
4,Jakes Scores Big Time!,"As he did so well in his Civil War trilogy and Kent Family Chronicles series, in On Secret Service John Jakes provides a very fast-paced story while blending in lots of interesting and little known facts about the Civil War and the role of the secret service. Also typical of his other works, Jakes provides such vivid descripions of his ""good"" and ""bad"" characters (both real-life and fictional) and of the historical period that I felt that I was right there observing these people and events -- rather than just a reader of a vey good book.On Secret Service has something for all readers -- lots of action, lots of interesting facts about the period before, during and immediately after the Civil War, well-developed characters, and romance. It is a book that I think you will enjoy very much. Actually, if the Amazon rating system allowed it, I would have given On Secret Service 4 1/2 stars. Enjoy!"
3,A bit short of author's usual standard . .,"Even so, the book held my interest throughout, and as always, I was able to pick up some historical facts I hadn't previously known. I just felt that the story line was rather formulaic not as cohesive as most of Jakes' work.My main purpose in submitting a review is a bit of a caution about the Kindle version. My download included four chapters which were repeated in their entirety. Chapter numbers were not repeated and all chapter numbers were sequential with no skips. Since the book skipped around between sub-plots, I don't know if the repeated chapters were just added clutter or if they caused me to lose other chapters. I'm new to Kindle, so I don't know if there was simply a ""hiccup"" in the download, a problem with the device itself, or an error in the master file (probably not, or complaints would be numerous)."
5,Opens NEW Doors into the Forerunner of the CIA....,Outstanding Book about a little know part of the Civil War; the good; bad and disgusting people that made up the population then....
1,A complete rip off,"First of all, this is simply a poor re-write of a great book, which is How to Make a 1,000,000 in the Stock Market Automatically!by Robert Lichello. This book mimics that book without any of the backstory. This book is mostly pages of poorly copied spreadsheets showing his stock results (from 12 years ago) and really has nothing to do with learning this system.While it is a great system, it is also a flawed system in that it teaches you to buy stocks as they go down, which can be a hugely bad idea (see Enron, Kmart, Krispy Kreme, America West Airlines, etc...etc...etc....)I can't believe I paid $26 to re-read the book I already own, How to Make a 1,000,000 in the Stock Market Automatically!by Robert Lichello which is only $7 and is a much better book. I feel like I've been robbed of $26."
4,fascinating discussion,"this book explains the relevance of the little-known, now un-sainted Saint Wilgefortis. The author carefully examines the history of this saint, analyzes current discussion of her, and provides an interesting feminist analysis on the veneration of Wilgefortis.It is a valuable contribution to the subject of women in Christianity."
5,cant beat an xacto knife,"can't beat an xacto knife. so many uses. sturdy and well made not like some of the off-brands on which blades come loose, or lack nice weight."
2,Wish I'd read reviews first,"I lost my long time Xacto knife (used for trimming charcoal and art pencils). I have a large supply of blades so I thought this was a great deal BUT it does not come with a cap. (I thought all Xacto blades did). Anyway I can't just read into my art boxes to pick up an uncovered knife, nor is it safe when my granddaughter decides she wants to admire all the charcoal, erasers and pencils. I'd already opened the package so I took the blade out and cast the handle into the box empty. Then I came back and ordered a blade with a cap. (sigh).Not a problem I suppose depending on where you keep it and how you use it. A cap would have made it a five-star item in my review."
4,Cut the $&@?,This has worked for me over and over. If I was to do it again I would get a case since it is so sharp I never know where to store it.
2,Can see all the best parts in the trailer,"After seeing the trailer I was expecting a very funny movie about an eccentric vampire family. All the funniest moments can be seen in the trailer and when seen in the context of the actual movie they weren't even that funny. I'm not sure what this movie was striving to be, comedy, horror, social documentary, or what; it just meandered from genre to genre. To give it some credit there were some pretty funny concepts to this movie and I wish the writers capitalized on those more. Then it would have been a pretty damn good movie. But, I feel they over thought it and over reached making it a complicated snooze fest instead."
1,5 months then dead,"Same as everyone else. Dead after a short time, long hold time to foreign customer service. $15 fee for them to ship replacement and for box to ship dead one back.No mention of this problem on their website support center."
2,planned obsolescence?,"Over the last year, we've had increasing connection troubles. I always assumed it was just a temporary glitch with our ISP. After seeing the orange failure light way too much over the last month and especially last couple of weeks, I finally had a tech from our ISP come out to determine what was the problem. He was confident that it was the modem, not the high-speed Internet service. I don't know how he determined this, but he thought there was something wrong with the power supply to the unit. The thing had begun power cycling just if you touched it. Of course, this product failure happened just a heartbeat AFTER the warranty expired. I bought this cable modem back when the reviews were better, around 3 years ago. Maybe 3 years is a long life, but I would expect longer for something that just sits there, with no moving mechanical parts. What an eye opener to come back to this review page and see so many people experience the same troubles."
1,Bad product and bad customer service,"The product failed after one day of serivce. For the next week it would intermitently connect to the Internet for a few hours and fail again for a few hours until it died completely. I called Customer Service, which seems to be overseas, and their technicians were terrible. In two calls I had conflicting answers and they did not seem to know how to troubleshoot the problem; they kept asking me to ping addresses unrelated to the modem and they kept refering to it as a router. Once they decided that it is defective they asked me to pay for shipping charges to replace my brand new modem which amounted to 25% of the cost of the product. I would never buy a Netgear product again."
1,Get out your pooper scooper,"Lasted just 3 months. What is up with that? 3 months and it's condition rhymes with the word plucked. After reading the other reviews I don't think I am even going to attempt returning it.Oh, and I don't know if anybody noticed, but the two good reviews were written by employees/officers/directors of Netgear. Check out the wording. One was ""commissioned"" and the other was ""provisioned"" !!! Hello ! Not even techies use those words."
1,same story,"I purchased the modem 9-1-03 and it died 11-17-03. Gave up trying to call Netgear, terminal hold..... 15$-$30 to have a new modem shipped is not worth the hassle. Avoid this modem (&netgear)"
1,Pretty BAD,Like others..........wish I had read the reviews on this item before buying. Bought Jan 04......dead Aug 04. $15 to send me a new one after getting through the long help desk procedure. New one lasted a week and a half. Have had the cable folks out three times and it is definately not the cable. Guess I will chalk this up to experience and go down to Fry's tomorrow and buy someone else's C/M that will hopefully work a lot better.
1,Bad Modem,"Should have read the reviews before I bought.Lasted about 3 months and started problems other had listed.NetGear will not honoor warranty, said I had to return to ISP since it is an ISP product and was not a retail product.That is crazy since I bought it at amazon.com"
4,works for me,"i've had this modem running on my Mac for over a year and it's never given me the hassles listed below. bought it, plugged it in--it connected immediately, and since then i've pretty much forgotten it's there. been a solid performer (knock on wood). the case even complements my Mac nicely."
1,Item Broke within a Month,"I purchased this cable modem just to have it break within a month. Netgear's tech support staff was incredibly unhelpful and it took 2 days of calling them just to convince them that it was in fact broken. They told us to ship it back and that they would ship us a new one once they received it. However, they expected us to pay the shipping to return it to them, and they were only going to ship it via regular USPS Parcel Post, thus leaving me without an internet connection for over a week. They did say, though, that they would overnight me a new one that say day for a $30 fee!!!! I will never do business with this company again."
1,Bad Product!,"Two modems quit working in two months! The first one in two days, the second two months later.As for customer support? Not existing. After three (3) hours on the phone in three days nothing has happened yet. Try it for your self: 1-888-638-4327 and the sequence for the customer support is 3-1-2-2-1-2. Lets see how long you can wait."
3,Punishers past,"this late eightes tale of The punisher, a killer vigilante confronting a secret miltiary organstion ,and then his own surpising past is a bit of a let down a great story with a couple of great twists is let down by slow story telling and not alot of action and all from mike baron a writer of the pun man too , art is still great today(bii reihold) which helps but sooo many good ideas are wasted here...... still worth picking up if you r a pun fan watch out for the killer twist at the end !!!!!"
3,AH WELL................,"This story (presented in hard back and soft back graphic novel) sums up mike barons time writing the vigalnte punisher in one go. his usual great ideas are in there as well as good supporting players and sub plots, but as usual the action suffers !!!!! and punisher fans CRAVE THE ACTION!!!!! if he had done this, it would be a classic ! great art by bill reihold is still great by todays standards (this book was printed in 1990 !) and he gives the pun man a mean look..... sub plot as well, about franks (punisher) past is truely unsual for what punisher fans are used too... just if there had have been more FIGHTING !!!! it would have been a must read for all pun man fans......"
2,Not much solid information here.,I was disappointed by the lack of advanced instruction in this book. Winning Racquetball includes precious little information that an intermediate player wouldn't already know. It seems this book is mostly filler. I was expecting insight on advanced strategies and how to improve on fundamentals. Instead I found a lot of information on how I should eat and what I should wear.
3,"Not bad, could be much better","I would like to see stop action sequenced photos of the basic forehand and backhand strokes. There is no picture of a decent backhand stroke in the chapter entitled ""Hitting Forehand and Backhand Shots"" and only two instructional photos.All instructional photos in the book are of Woody Clouse a LEFT-HANDED player. Why would you use photos that are appropriate for only 10% of the population?The text presentation is quite good but the photos leave a lot to be desired."
4,Lyrical artistry,"Jeanne is a talented singer and songwriter who weaves her stories of pain and healing with a clear, compelling voice. She sings of making it through the challenges of abuse and being a single mother, as well as her love for the beauty around her. Her songs, like her paintings, come straight from the heart.The song ""Lifelines"" tells of following the journeys of a son trying to make his own way in life. That son is Eli Mattson (whose piano backs up some of her songs), and Jeanne has given him the gift of poetry and music. For anyone who likes blues/folk/jazz, give ""Lost Moth: Found"" a try, and look for her newest CD, ""Ghost Ranch""."
4,Another Mindless Review,"Once again (as if this is a new CD) MSI has outdone themselves, this isa great album that I think really showcases them as a band. However, to be honest, the only reason I would buy the CD is for the album art, since every song on it is now rippable from limewire or message boards (you cray kids); and I would certainly not buy it for 44 dollars. Somewhere, Jimmy Urine is out there laughing it up."
3,Good adventure reading for rainy day,A good rainy day read. I am sure there is a bit of exaggeration in the exploits but it is fun to read and kind of inspirational for us poser bikers. I have toured most of the US and that presents quite enough challenges for me but it is good to live vicariously with someone who jumps of in a big way......and it get you a book deal also. Good stuff al in all.
5,"Amazing man, amazing book","I had the pleasure of meeting Glen Heggstad before I actually read his book, and I am amazed that someone who went through so much used his experiences to make him stronger. If that had been me, I would have curled up in the fetal position and remained there for the rest of my life. But Glen is truly an amazing individual, and I know that anyone who reads this book will come away with a greater understanding and appreciation for not only their own lives, but for all humankind. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a new perspective on life."
2,"Quote on page 357, paragraph 2 sums it all up.","Written for the ""Good Morning America"" television audience. If you enjoy listening to people talk about how great they are, this book is right up your alley. Get real, how seriously can you take somebody that refers to them-self as ""The Striking Viking""? Give me a break!If you enjoy authenticity but dislike grandstanding, try one of these books instead.1. One Man Caravan/Book2. Jupiters Travels/Book3. Mondo Enduro/Book4. Journey Beyond Reason/Book5. Riding Solo to the Top of the World/DVD"
5,"Inspiring, indeed!","While the title of the book and most of the comments focus on his stay with the Columbian terrorists, for me the most inspiring bits of the book were his descriptions of the parts of his journey through Mexico and Argentina. Now I want to visit Mexico and see if it is as wonderful a place as he described. Ditto Argentina, though it is not quite as close.A very well-written book by a talented and very versatile author. Much more than a tale of terror. You could skip the Columbian fiasco and still get your money's worth (and then some) from this book."
4,Good insights and interesting content,"Enjoyed this book. Well organised, easily read and always interesting. Common sense commentaries from a balanced writer. Practical and honest with a good mix of riding, geography, personal thoughts and socio-political views. I finished it in 2 sessions. One of the better motorcycle touring books I've read. I recommend it."
5,Glen's the Real Deal!,If you like travel books and/or motorcycle journals this is a must read but its also a lot more then that. This guy is an inspiration for his determination through hardship that would certainly defeat the majority of us.
4,two wheels through terror,"A well detailed description of a very tough journey. Glenn Heggstad is a true adventure biker, virtually unstoppable. His writing ability keeps the story interesting, without delving into sensationalism, as some writers are prone to do. This book will make the most seasoned traveler stop and say ""Man; I would have went home""."
1,Great words to pass on.,"I just finished reading Glen Heggstad'S TWO WHEELS THROUGH TERROR. I love to read this type of 'adventure' book. I live vicariously through the adventures of other people and boy, was this an adventure. What makes this book even more delicious is Glen's use of the written word. He tells the story so completely and brings the whole feeling to life that you are actually traveling with him. You won't go far once you sit down with this book in your hands and some good reading time. How great to have writers like this tell us what other people and other countries are like."
4,"Okay, not Garcia-Marquez, but a fun book to read","I accidently logged onto the ""STRIKINGVIKING"" website one day and followed his ride. One day when he reached Colombia, it just stopped. Years later, I found the book and what happened to him. The book is rather simplistic but a real page turner, and I re-lived the times I have been in the same places he visited.The chapter where he was kidnapped was riveting. I am not a judo expert; I can barely flip an egg, but have wondered how I would cope with a kidnapping down there.He made me hate those SOB rebels even more.I think he just finished a ride around Asia. Is there another book coming?"
2,Left deflated...,"Really disappointed in the book. I'm actually forcing myself to finish it. The authors story telling is vague and treats the reader as if they've never been on vacation or ridden a motorcycle. He writes it as if the general public will read it instead of motorcyclist which I find hard to believe. No motorcycle details and alot of ""Sun on your face and wind in your hair..."" fluff. Or I should say rain on your face. He had a great adventure and an extraordinary tale of captivity but a writer he is not."
3,It's OK,"I already rated at the time I purchased that. Just to reinforce what I wrote at that time, I didn't order used parts. And looking at the edges I can see that there are some sealant remaining. I'm using it. It works well. BUT be careful in sending used parts when the order was for new ones."
2,"Unique design, slightly disappointed in performance.","I have a substantial Nerf armory, and I liked the concept of this gun, but it failed in execution. I dont like the new wave of battery powered nerf guns, so I thought this air powered one would be a neat addition. The biggest flaw in the design is the pressure. In most cases the tank doesnt hold enough pressure to feed through the entire clip, leaving the bottom few darts in the gun. I've pumped the hell out of the thing and 3 out of 4 times it fails to fire the entire clip. Its not my favorite gun so I'll probably tear it down and see if I can fiddle with the seals. I did like the clip design having its own belt clip for easy carry."
1,darts don't fully shoot even with strong pumping--not fun!,"Santa brought two of these to our 10 year old. It wouldn't shoot all of the darts, even with heavy pumping from her dad (who is plenty strong.) Not fun at all. Very, very disappointed. Returned them."
5,aewsome gun,this is a great gun.i am almost eleven. this is great for annoying pets and familly. the fact in can fire ten darts in rapid succesion is great.the reload clips are really useful especcially since they clip onto your belt. this is a great gun!
4,fun ride!,"I enjoyed this movie. I admit, it is what it is, you can see right through the cover with what direction the film wants to go. I must say, I was entertained. I wasn't looking for Gladiator, or even another Twilight ... I would have heard about this ... straight to dvd movie about a rock band of werewolves ... awesome. There could have been more blood and gore, and it could have been more scary, but it was more fun than scary. The music was ok. My favorite parts were anytime the whole rock band was around and got involved."
2,NOTHING NEO HERE,"One of the ten worst werewolf movies of all time! Why someone of Veronica Cartwright's talents is involved in this mess is beyond me. Horrible acting, effects, music, script...horrible everything. Makes TWILIGHT saga look epic..lol."
1,I was disappointed,"I was looking forward to reading this book based on articles in the local papers about Mr. Arts, but boy, was I disappointed! It's full of anachronistic stereotypes (Irish cops who call each other ""mick"" [in late 20th century Passaic County??], evil Hispanic drug dealers with no morals) and the descriptions of violence are unnecessarily extreme. The main storyline was pretty humdrum. I was surprised that none of the parents in town seemed to mind that it was required reading at Clifton High. -I gave my copy away."
1,Forget expensive sleeping pills...,"What a boring video, ""EXTREME UNDERGROUND WRESTLING"" what a catchy name! if you look at the back cover and see all of the grammer mistakes, you'd obviously know what is in side. Wrestling from around the world, california, idaho, scotland, england, and CANADA! Most of these ""hardcore"" incidents (ie toy guitar over the head not once, not twice, but 3 times!) are shown a minimum of four times. The two women in this video make no sense, while somewhat appealing to the eye, I wonder why they are in this, they have no reason to be. Basically you see some kids do some dumb thing, see a 1 second clip of the ladies dancing topless, see some kids do some dumb things, see the same 1 second clip.THE MUSICWhat kind of royalty free music is this? A 30-second guitar/techno thing, looped over and over....Did i mention that there is two parts to this dvd! 2 hrs. of the same thing over and over... WOOOOOOOOO!"
1,Worst of the Worst....,"Backyard Wrestling dvds are always bad...but sometimes they have that ""Jackass"" appeal of seeing people do stupid things to each other and sometimes it can be entertaining even if bad. Not here. This is 'VHS Quality' videos, mixed with shots of unattractive bimbos topless, mixed with bad sound effects. I got to see this DVD as part of the FULL CONTACT FIGHTS 5DVD Box set which is primarily professional (and real) Mixed Martial-Arts shows. But it also included this. And I just had to do my part to spare any of you the Ripoff feeling you'll get if you buy this DVD here. Not even worth seeing for free. F. --RobP.S. is it me, or do I see about a 5 second clip of C.Z.W Pro Wrestler Ruckus ,doing a backflip off a makeshift ring in somebodies Backyard. It sure looks like him and it looks just like the backflips he does in CZW, But I could be wrong. Stay away from this DVD and the VHS."
2,WHAT?,"WHAT? THAT`S WHAT YOU SAY WHEN YOU SEE THIS VIDEO,IT`S ALLRIGTH IF YOU WANT TO SEE TWO LADIES IN BIKINIES DOING STUPID THINGS,BUT NOT RECOMENDED FOR KIDS,AND THEY DID NOT SHOW THE MATCHES IN THEIR INTIRE VERSIONS PLUS THEY DIN`T PUT THE ACTUAL AUDIO OF EACH MATCH,BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME CRAZY KIDS DOING HARDCORE MOVES THAN YOU HAVE TO SEE IT,PLUS IT`S GOOD FOR THE PRICE OF THE VIDEO,MY HAT GOES OUT TO DOES CRAZY KIDS WHO DID ALL THOSE MATCHES IF YOU CAN CALL THEM THAT,I HOPE YOU GUYS MAKE IT TO THE TOP KEEP WORKING HARD...."
4,It was little unsatisfactory.,"Until now, although some Backyard Wrestling VHS had been seen, this was a little unsatisfactory.I'm moderate chapter composition and thought it good that a favorite scene could be seen flexibly.However, it was regrettable that a debt of an awkward effect sound and a meaningless lady comes out (it was interesting enough only at honesty and the chairman).If it adjusts, is it a place called the result of price suitability?"
1,Dreadful,"I'm usually a fan of political thrillers, especially those in the Roger Donaldson mold. Those shot in my home town of Washington DC are almost always high on my list. The only question I can ask, after seeing this film, is how the heck did the producers get permission to shoot at the REAL White House? This film is dreadful. It makes no sense. The acting is flat, and the soundtrack is amateurish. Jan Gan Boyd may well play the least believable Secret Service agent ever on film. Avoid this film like it was radioactive."
3,One of Bronson's lesser Cannon movies.,"Charles Bronson plays a Secret Service Agent assigned to protect the First Lady, who is played by his then real life wife Jill Ireland. When the First Lady becomes the target of an assassin, she and Bronson go on the run, dodging bullets as he tries to find clues as to who is behind it all. This 1987 offering from Cannon studios was nothing special. Director Peter Hunt had previously helmed the James Bond thriller On Her Majesty's Secret Service and the Charles Bronson/Lee Marvin action/chase thriller Death Hunt. Both are far superior to this movie, which features action scenes and assassination attempts that are as unbelievable as they are uninspired. The chemistry between Bronson and Ireland is nice, and the movie does have a sense of humor about itself, but that doesn't stop it from being the most mediocre of the Cannon/Bronson movies."
3,Secret Agent Man Charles Bronson protects First Lady Ireland,"Charles Bronson plays a Secret Service Agent assigned to protect the First Lady, who is played with snootily comic verve by his real life wife Jill Ireland. When Mrs. President becomes the target of an assassination conspiracy Bronson takes her undercover (no, not like that), dodging bullets as he tries to find clues as to who is behind it all. Nothing special, just painless fun for die hard Bronson fans."
5,Fun Charles Bronson Film,"What's with all the bad reviews everybody? It's a Charles Bronson action picture for goodness sakes. We have explosions, we have action, and we get to see Bronson act with his beautiful wife, Jill Ireland. What we have here is an hour and a half of fun on the silver screen. Bronson will be remembered as one of the best action film heroes. SO, don't go into this film, with your brain turned on, turn it off and you'll enjoy it more."
3,Cannon Lite,"This is one of the lesser Cannon/Bronson collaborations(though many would say that they are all ""lesser""). It was made in the final hours of Cannon before bankruptcy and it shows. Bronson's the agent assigned to protect the first lady, a real you-know-what. Many attempts are made on her life, forcing her and Bronson on the run. Soon, we see her softer side, they become pals, tra-la, tra-la. Pretty by the numbers plot. This was a tame PG-13 effort from Cannon, so all the gratuitous violence and nudity are gone, making it not quite the Cannon we all love. Bronson and Ireland do exchange some funny lines from time to time, but that's about as entertaining as this film gets. If you collect Bronson flicks, this should be the last one you get, if at all."
3,Get Ready For Laffs,"The films of Mr. Charles Bronson require a different rating scale than other movies. This is why I previously granted ""Death Wish 3"" five stars. I'm not saying it compares to ""Singin' In the Rain"" or ""Mean Streets"" or ""Nashville"" but as far as Bronson films go, it's vital. This one not so much, though if you thought the ""casting couch"" had vanished in the late 80's, get a load of the gal who plays Charlie's young girlfriend! This is certainly no ""In the Line of Fire"" but it's short and stuff blows up. I remember when this was released theatrically and Mr. Bronson and his late wife Ms. Ireland were on TV plugging it. Charlie voiced his dislike of the extreme violence in ""Death Wish 3"" (i.e., the tons of violent footage Michael Winner added to the climactic scenes). Shame he didn't recognize the movie for the masterwork it has become."
5,GREAT FUN FULL OF ACTION,I SAW THIS MOVIE BACK IN THE 80s 'I REALY LIKE THIS MOVIE BRONSON PLAY'S A HIRED ASSASSIN AND HE BECOMES THE FIRST LADY BODYGUARD ALSO STARRING JILL IRELAND IT'S ALOT OF FUN AND HIGH IMPACT ACTION THRILLER..
3,woof !!!,"usual good bronson action. Should have brought doggy treats for jill ireland, woof !!! If bronson had put her down, the bad guys would have cheered!"
3,singing bird,"thought it talked , it sings with any movement and gets on your nerves pretty quickly but didn't cost too much"
3,toy parakeet,"its made of a hollow plastic and mine only made noise like the first 2 days i got it but only when it was off and then i turned it on it would do it once,but a pretty cool toy for the money i dont have a real bird. also came with batteries"
5,Amazing,"I guess it's an electronic item so some might not work, but I really don't see how anyone can give this a bad review. I am using it for a real bird, not as a toy for myself. So my review is very serious.I have a very aggressive budgie and she bosses over and bullies the smaller one. She is spoiled silly and after the other one died of a stroke (when we were away nonetheless), we thought we should transition her with this toy.She was scared stiff at first because she is scared of everything at first. Now she abuses the budgie buddy. I am so happy it's a toy and not a real bird. A real bird will not be able to take this amount of torture. But she thinks it's real and plays with it. The buddy sings back. It takes a while to get used to that cheeping noise, but hey if the bird likes it, it stays. You can see why my bird is spoiled now, can't you?So my advice, buy these when you can't buy real birds for various reasons (even if you are still in mourning)."
4,very life-like,"desription was spot on on.my budgies just have to get use to it. they are not afraid and the sound is very close to a real parakeet, but they just go about there normal day and look at it from time to time.at least they aren't frightened of it or scared to go by it. still glad i bought it."
2,cute l,this bird looks real sounds real but the churps have no rest time its ongoing but I plan to hang it in a tree in the spring in hopes that it scares away squirrels from bird feeder
1,Way too heavy for my use,I wasn't expecting such a heavy cane and won't use them. They would be good for a very large person 300+ pounds perhaps. You can get exercise from just being able to carry them.
4,watch out for the pump,"the lotion is fine, however, the pump that came along with my order was much too small for the gallon container"
3,Duplicate Album,"I had the same experience as Lenny. I ordered this, thirsty for more of the Heavy Metal band ""Terra Firma,"" but I got a duplicate of their first album. The only difference is the artwork which is slightly, and I mean very slightly, clearer and less cheap looking from their self titled album. As far as the band goes they've only released two cd's, those being a terrific self titled album and the incredible ""Harm's Way,"" after which they broke up. There is no album called ""DTO."" Its just a different name for an album already previously released. I gave it 3 stars because it is a really good album, but its misleading nature is not good for people trying to buy a Terra Firma album they don't have."
4,SAUCY DELIGHTS FROM SWINGING ENGLAND!,"Even if you are a prude you still may enjoy these three tame, but eye filling movies made in and around London in the 1970s. This was before the era of hard-core porn in theaters and VCRs. The movies now seem innocent and that's what makes them delightful in their own way. There are plenty of fully naked beautiful young ladies running around in all three films. This was always worth the price of admission. The stories and situations are for the most part fun, many familiar actors of the era appear in them. Production values are good and all three movies are in color."
4,"Looks fantastic, but not so tasty","While the wrapper is artfully done, I was disappointed with the filling. I don't know if the one I got was a factory defect or not, but once I had removed the elaborate wrapper, I found it was empty, without even the smell of chocolate. After this, I'll stick with Cadbury eggs, but my experience may not be representative of the normal presentation. I've given the product 4 stars because of the wrapper, though, while difficult to tear off, it was certainly stunning."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I was very disappointed to find that this chocolate egg was past it's sell by date. It has a slimy texture reminiscent of cheap christmas tree decorations. If you appreciate your chocolate, go for the full-price item as you'll really notice the difference."
4,Very Happy with the Free shipping part of it,"Having been an admirer of Faberge eggs for quite some time, this price was something I could'nt turn down, I never pay full price for anything and knew if I just waited I would be able to get a $2.5 Million dollar piece for under $200 eventually.Only thing that soured the deal was it did'nt qualify for free shipping...hence the 4 stars !!!"
3,misleading price!,"The discount seems to be a little off - 100% of 2.5 million dollars is 2.5 million, meaning this product should be free, but instead they are only taking 99.994% of the list price. This is a disappointment. As a result, these items should be shipped free to all Amazon customers."
3,Eggy... ewww,I think it was poor marketing on Faberge's part. Who wants to smell like eggs? I prefer Brut.
1,"This is FAKE Faberge, read their description!","Read the product desription closely, folks--it is a Faberge STYLE egg, NOT a Faberge egg. Hence the 99.9945% discount."
1,Its 250$ not 2.5mil,obviously there was a typo here. look at their other products - all between 250$ and 400$.
2,Not worth your time (or money),"I bought this book based on the other two reviews for it in the hopes that it was going to be something that I could learn something from. I was greatly dissapointed when I found out the book is made out of some random (and oftentimes too short to be of good use) facts and tips from the author. The knots section only includes FOUR types of knots and the navigation section (at least in my book) was a complete joke; the author briefly describes what a GPS is and how it works and then proceeds to suggest you to learn how to use a map and a compass. There are thousands of excellent books on camping and survival, this is not one of them."
2,Not even a good book for beginners,"I bought this book hoping to get something useful out of it, but I was dissapointed when I found out that its information is incomplete and very shallow. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,Great value,It fits well and looks great. A little bit thinner fabric than I expected but not a problem at all. Seems to be well made.
5,Very good book,"I just play around with miniatures as the mood strikes. Since there aren't any others in my area who have a talent for making miniature 'anything', I buy books to help me understand basic ways to begin making say, fruits, cookware, dinnerware, silverware, desserts, etc. out of Sculpy or other brand name products. This book is an excellent source of 'how to' make so many wonderful miniatures. It should be on every miniature hobbyist's book shelf. Jam packed with all kinds of tips and how to's to help you along the way. Well worth the purchase. How to sell them, if that's your goal, is very helpful and will help you a lot down the road."
5,Great Acitvity Studio,"This is a great CD (and it is clearly labeled Activity Studio). The wallpapers are creative, large and high resolution. The other features are great also, including screensaviors, Art, Graphics creation like calendars, posters and bookmarks, charcter profiles. It's a must have for the Tolkien fan who likes the New Line Movies."
2,Nice wallpapers- everything else lacking,"The wallpapers on this activity studio are really nice, and the images are different from the ones available to download from the official website, but everything else is very similar (the format of the calendars is pretty much the same as the format of the posters, and of the flyers....) I was a little disappointed."
3,Disappointed,"This is an activity studio, which was not on the title when I ordered! I thought I was ordering a game!!!"
2,"Less Capacity, Cover does not fit","Battery was advertised to meet or exceed manufacturer spec.Manufacturer-supplied batteries have capacity of 6000 mah. The replacement battery supplied provides only 4800 mah capacity.The battery supplied does not have an integral cover, but an aftermarket cover. The cover does not fit the battery or the battery opening in computer properly. The battery cover will not stay mounted in the computer. The battery cover falls off the bottom of the computer, leaving the battery exposed and making the computure a three legged computerHow does this battery meet or exceed original manufacturer specs?????"
1,You get what you pay for.,"While the battery was shipped fast and I did get it in record time, I am extremely dissapointed in the quality. First is that I did not get either of the covers that other reviewers seem to rave about and had to pop the old cover off of my dead battery. The fit was not perfect and I had to try to insert the battery several times. Sadly had this been the only issue I would have let the matter drop, but now after a couple of months use I have to say that the battery does not hold a charge very long at all. I maybe get an hour of uninterrupted use, before I have to scramble to find an outlet. Also, if I leave the computer unplugged even if it is turned off, the battery discharges over night and I have to start up with the power cord and recharge the battery every day.I should have spent the money on a real battery from HP. I still might."
4,A good after market battery...for once,"I bought this replacement battery for my compaq. The price was right and the battery runs for almost as long as the original one did. I meam maybe I get 15 minutes less run time but for half the cost of an OEM battery, I can live with it. Oh, In fairness to the battery mfg. the age of my laptop may play a part in the shorter run time."
1,Hewlett Packard Main Battery,"The picture show me one OEM battery Hewlett Packard, but the battery sold is North Parts.I have a problem with this battery one year ago, because the battery loss the charge inmediatly.I am very dissapointed with this product because is not Hewlett Packard"
2,This needed work when I got it.,"The backing for it didn't fit and I had to remove the backing from the old battery and use that. Then the cover on the bottom of it doesn't cover the whole bottom. If I hadn't needed the battery when it arrived I would have immediatly returned it. It does hold a 2 hr charge though so it is ""useable""."
1,Battery Biz Li-lon Laptop Battery,"The battery doesn't hold a charge, nor does it charge fully. It seems to be a refurbished battery that has been advertised as being new."
2,Not so good!,"It sure fit well, but just does not hold a charge very long. It may be because the laptop is an older unity and uses more juice, but this one does not hold a charge as long as the original."
3,Misleading Image,(2/9/2012) I just received the battery so far it works. It to soon to say if the battery is bad or not I purchased this for a client to replace there 3rd party battery. Now the item picture is a great scam I was under the impression that I was ordering a new original battery but that is not what is being sold it is a 100% OEM compatible 3rd party replacement. Hopefully the battery works like an original this review may change depending on the items performance
1,Total Scam,"I bought the battery based on the image showing an original HP battery, however the battery is some fake brand and is only 4.8 mah which is weaker than the original battery that deliver 6.8 mah. anyway. this is totally wrong !!! complete deception !!!"
4,good worldy music,"the drumming on this cd is fantastic -- complex interesting rhythmsthe music is wild, from upbeat to textured curving ambient dronesthe Persian style vocals are of course beautiful & very movingI don't know about how ""spiritual"" this music is, in the sense that Vas is spiritual in, but it's great music nonetheless"
3,Does its job,"I lost my charger and couldn't believe how much it cost at stores to buy a replacement. This one is a bit slow, but it does the job. It was worth it to me to just buy a cheap one because I don't use my camera that often.No complaints!"
5,Why didn't I buy this years ago?,"With this charger, I can take pictures whenever I want without being tied up with the OEM bulky charger. Excellent delivery. A great buy!"
1,It is simply a fake. Never worked in the car and burnt out in the home after one use. Fake Rip Off,The Sony batter doesn't fit into the cradle. The car adapter doesn't work. The home plug in burnt out within 4 hours of use.
3,THE IMPORTANCE OF A BLACK BONNET,"This quiet little book of 20 short chapters is based on the diary of a young, teenage girl named Virginia, written presumably by her granddaughter. It stresses the importance of family ties and the sacred trust of honoring one's promises to a dying parent. Over the years we watch Virgie--the baby of a large family--undergo the transformation to Virginia, who comes of age in several ways.We see her inner struggles to overcome shyness and the social stigma of poverty on the Nebraska plains. We witness the Dunkers' church and their value on outward Conformity. Virginia learns that when the Lord opens a door, one should trust Him enough to go through it; something different and perhaps better may be waiting for us on the other side. He knows His plan for each of his children. With the emphasis on a simple, black bonnet as evidence of church membership, I am reminded of THEE HANNAH, whose young, vain heroine learns the importance of the plain, Quaker bonnet."
4,Exotic,"I have gathered a few examples of Leo's editions down through the years. Being a 20th century music fan as well as jazz enthusiast i have no problem enjoying the sometimes totally new and unexpected turns in this rather experimental 'jazz'. His music may require rearranging your thinking when listening.In Kabell there are 2 cds which are solo and on the other 2 he is with other musicians though the approach to the pieces is more or less the same: sparse, distant notes and quick compressed passages against a wide and deep sound stage or background...be bop or traditional jazz elements are only suggested. There is no sense of time keeping though it seems much of this is written down (as the booklet shows). A true musician working in his own musical world. I would recommend this to the listener looking for something challenging, expecting rewards after a few repeated spins."
3,A Funny DePalma Film,"If your a fan of Nancy Allen or Brian DePalma, or Keith Gordon you should enjoy this one. It's not the best of Brian DePalma's work, but I fell in love with the humour.This is deminstated in numerous scenes with Nancy Allen. I loves the two scenes when 1. Her hand puppet rabbit comes alive-who didn't laugh at the bit''I'm rabbit and this is toots with the heavenly body, catch us at the pussycat,catch us at the pussycat.2. After she's been out eating hamburgers with Keith Gordons character, her boyfriend gets the scent of something he hasn't smelt in a long time ie( he's only eating health food- he puts her through a series of tests to see if she's worthy of being with him). It's worth a look."
3,"A good compendium, but not an essential one...","The Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix II, is an interesting addition to the collection of any DM interested to run adventures on the outer planes. However this book will only be of minor interest to anybody else. The artwork in the book, done by DiTerlizzi, is pretty good, altough I prefer the job he did on the first compendium. A lot of the monsters included in this book had not been featured in any other supplement before. Exemples of what you will be getting for your monney are: a new race usable for the PC'S (Aasimar), 3 new angelic species (Eladrin, Lupinal, Guardinal), and a new tanari ( Maurezhi). To sum it up the book is interesting, but considering the high cost of these Planescape's Compendiums you should only buy it if you intend to run most of your campaign on the outer planes."
4,Good fun,"if you like the beatles and you like christmas music, download this album. some of the songs work better than others, but all in all it was well worth it."
2,"NOT The Beatles, nor an incredible simulation.","Along the lines of A Fab Four Christmas and The Beatmas comes The Butties' version of ""What if The Beatles sang Christmas songs?"" Overall, The Butties are good musicians, and have nice voices. Unfortunately, none of them sound anything like the Lads from Liverpool, England. It's difficult to explain what makes a good xmas tribute CD, but here are some requirements and my ratings of The Butties:-Vocals: 2/5 Good singers, but they don't sound like the Beatles. American accents, etc.-Instruments: 4/5 Very authentic, and tight.-Choice of Beatles vs. Xmas Songs: 1/5 This is where it really sounds like they're forcing the issue. Some songs are so bad, that they're unlistenable (my wife actually asked me on Christmas Day to ""please turn it off"" after only 2 songs).Save your money, and buy The Fab Four's version.Bobbie"
4,Best Multi-Purpose Bag Ever,"I love this bag. Its the perfect size to hold basic purse contents and also doubles as a small shopping bag when I'm out picking up little things. The straps never fall off my shoulder and I've never lost my cell phone in the bag as there are several small pockets in and around the bag for me to store it. The super cute pattern is an added bonus, I get so many compliments on how cute the bag is."
3,ReRelease of 1 and 2,"I though we had another in Modesitt's Ghost series, but it's just a re-release of the first and second volumes in one. If you're not familiar with the series, it's wonderful, quite different from his other series, and well worth reading. This would be a pretty good place to start. If you are familiar with the series, you probably already have this."
1,Stone the commie!,"the whole purpose of those book is somehow create sublimial messaging to the reader. he somehow tries to demean christianity in the fact that pegans were more ""open to other religions"" and then blames socrates death at the end to being ""irregilous"" which is a contradiction to what he said early in the book. he also seems to have an emotional response to many of the arguements socrates brings up about democracy. If u wanna learn about socrates I.F. stones book is not the one to read. hes a journalist not a historian and his politcaly laden book proves that he just shouldnt have written it. the only people who think this book is good are ignoramouses or individuals who share in his view point of ""social justice"" and niether are going to help you understand ancient greece and her philosphers..."
1,Yellow journalism 500 years B.C.,"Nietzsche once claimed that it is amazing that God learned Greek to speak to humankind. Even more amazing is that he did not learn it better. I. F. Stone learned Greek to write this book. Had he learned chinese, he could have written a bad book about Confucius. Stone claims a half-wit founded a twenty-five year philosophical tradition. Is it not more plausible to say that the man making the claim is the half-wit? I took a week reading this book, a week I will never get back. What a waste!"
2,Communist agent condemns Socrates.,"In this weird book, I.F. Stone, who has been exposed as a paid agent of the Soviet Union by documents made available since the fall of the Berlin Wall, denounces Socrates and the Athenians -- at the same time! Truly, this is a bizarre book by a man whose opinion regarding the proper form of government (the real question at issue between Socrates and his polis) is worthy of virtually no weight."
3,Weak effort,"The analysis in this book seems to be that Socrates did a really bad job of defending himself at trial and insulted the jury, therefore he was put to death. Stone glosses over the Peloponnesian War and subsequent rule of tyrants, context much more useful for understanding the death of Socrates than anything in Plato's Apology."
5,Well written/researched book,I bought the hardback edition of this book for a song at a used bookstore - it was brand new - for this price. It is a fantastic book. You have to take it slow because there is so much information in it. I am completely enamored with Stone. This guy really went the extra mile in trying to get his unbiased view. I've had to put this book down twice when I checked it out from the library so I decided to just go ahead and buy it. I am now on my third reading. I love this book. There is more to it than just Socrates and it is a great book in the study of Ancient Greece. It is not the easiest book to read but that is because there are so many names/ideas. Well worth the effort to understand. They should use this book in a philosophy class.
3,Great mac & cheese,"This book is not really a good source for an accurate history of American foodways. However, the recipes are simple, easy to follow, and consistently good. All in all, United Tastses of America makes an accessible introduction to the traditional foods of American ethnic groups. It has become one of my ""source"" cookbooks. Plus, the macaroni and cheese recipe is the best I've found-- completely decadent, but worth every bite."
1,Awful,"""Leaving scars"" is boring and witless. For a softcore video, there is very little to look at.""Emmanuelle, Queen of the Desert"" is a poor transfer of a softcore movie that thinks it is a western with something new to add to the genre. It also has nothing in common with any Emmanuelle you might be used to.I was suckered by the bargain price. Don't follow my lead."
3,Worked for me,"These are not Oscar material, but there was enough flesh to get a person excited, its entertaining enough. Its two movies so if you can get the DVd for five bucks or so its cheaper than renting and worth the trouble."
4,Good for beginners,I got this DVD for my spouse. She liked it very much. It takes you through basic movements with a relaxing background music for atmosphere. Nice setting that promotes a no-stress workout.
3,"Beautiful, but not for the novice","Ok, I like this DVD a lot, and I will probably use it more; however, it is definetely not for the absolute beginner - which I am...Gorgeous surroundings which appeals to me more than studio rooms! The instructor is pleasant enough to watch with a clear voice; however, she could be a bit more beginner-oriented...All in all, a nice yoga DVD that I will return to after I learn more basics..."
4,"Not exactly for beginners, but a very good yoga DVD","This is a nice addition for including yoga practice in a fitness routine. The scenery is fantastic and the music very calming and complementary to the yoga moves. The feature instructor takes the poses at a reasonable pace and has a very soothing voice as she describes the sequence.Having taken yoga before I still found the tape a challenging workout. The poses are not described in great detail and thus a true beginner trying yoga for the first time may have some difficulty following the first time or two. However, I found it a very satisfying and challenging workout even for me who despite having taken some yoga classes still considers myself a yoga novice."
3,not for beginners,"While this is not a bad DVD, it is far too strenuous and, in places, complex for real beginners. Only try this if you have at least some experience in a yoga class."
3,Much more difficult than AM/PM Yoga by element,"I chose this DVD after trying the AM/PM Yoga DVD produced by the same company with the same instructor. Since both are listed as for beginners, I expected this DVD to be the same difficulty but with more variation. As I wouldn't want anyone else to make the same mistake, be aware that this DVD has much less explanation and transition time between poses in comparison the the AM/PM DVD. Several of the poses were also more difficult than the ones in the other DVD as well. If you are an advanced beginner this is the DVD for you, but if you are less experienced try the AM/PM DVD by element first instead."
4,Good Starting Place,"The local YMCA used to offer a class called ""Exercise for the Not Yet Fit"". I was thinking as I was looking at the lowest star reviews (I always read the lowest ones first) and thinking that in this case some people might have mistaken Beginning Yoga for Yoga for the Not Yet Fit. While Ms Brower addresses the possibility that a viewer may not be in condition to perform some of the poses, she does assume a minimum amount of flexibility and strength in the student.The production values on this DVD are very good. The background is serene and beautiful and Ms. Brower's voice is pleasantly calm. In fact, I have to admit that the first time I veiwed this I fell asleep-- but it was at the end of a very tiring, stressful week. Since then I have found that this can provide a pleasant interlude when life and/or work are too demanding. I'm not particularly concerned about the spiritual side of Yoga so there are benefits for those who want to participate on every level."
4,Easy to Follow,"I have been using this DVD on and off for a number of years. I have tried many yoga workouts and I seem to always come back to this Element yoga workout. It is easy to follow for beginners, and I always feel calm and toned after the workout!"
3,Not for true beginners,"The production quality of this video is excellent and Elena Brower appears to be a wonderful yoga instructor. The yoga sequence would be excellent for someone with a bit more yoga practice under their belt. The instruction could be much more in-depth; I had to go online to look up more in-depth instruction. Some of the poses were more difficult than some videos categorized as beginner/intermediate or even intermediate. I viewed the video three times: first just to view it, the second time trying to follow along, and the third time following along after having reading up on the poses on the internet. It was still too difficult for a true beginner. More detailed instruction, discussion about proper form, discussion of modifications, and perhaps a second instructor demonstrating the modifications would have made this video more accessible for a beginner. I'm going to shelve this one for awhile and continue my search for a good beginner's yoga."
4,Very challenging,"I have never done yoga before and know really nothing about it. I picked this up the other day and gave it a try that night. From a know-nothing-beginner point of view, it seems fine to me. The instructor is pleasant and gives lots of detail about how to move, where to position your feet and how to breathe. I was surprised by how challenging it was! I had thought yoga was basically just stretching, but it's amazing how much of a workout I got. Many of the poses require you to work hard on your balance, which gives you a great core workout. Being a newbie, I have a long way to go and I think this video will last me for a while.I did not even finish the whole DVD the first time through, but even so, I felt great afterwards - very relaxed."
3,This ain't for beginners,"While this certainly is a beautifully produced tape, to say it is for beginners is misleading. I certainly cannot twist and turn like this and modifications are left up to you to figure out.If I were more flexible and stronger, I would rate this DVD with 5 stars because its really Yoga for Intermediate People.Now my all time favorite real beginner's DVD is Pilates Complete for Inflexible People by Maggie Rhoades. You don't get the Hawaiian scenery but you should be able to tackle most of the exercises. Also the Rhoades DVD combines both Pilates and Yoga and actually shows beginner modifications using a chair, a strap and a pillow."
4,Perfect for a beginner,"It's easy to see why Elena Brower has earned such high marks from publications such as the New York Times and Yoga Journal. As a beginning yoga student, I found her yoga instruction to be clear--I didn't have to keep looking up to the screen to understand what the next move would be because she explained each movement in a clear and concise manner. The poses seemed just about right for a beginner--it wasn't too hard but still left me hoping to improve my abilities with further practice. I especially liked the environment she chose for the video--a colorful garden set against a deep blue ocean. I felt really calm and centered after finishing the routine and plan to continue practicing yoga with Ms. Brower's DVD. (This review was written by Nate's wife, Andrea, who has been the primary user of this product.)"
5,Wonderful Yoga Pracitce,"This video is my favorite yoga video right now. I always feel calm and relaxed and stretched out after completing it. I can tell it has helped me become more flexible. The instructor Elena Brower's voice is very soothing as she talks you through the routine. It says ""beginner"" in the title, but I really think it is an intermediate yoga practice, unless you are a flexible beginner. However, I highly recommend everyone try it. It is a great way to start the morning or relax after a long day, if you have more than 30 minutes to complete the routine."
3,Good support but cheap fabric inside,"The shoes perform well for the running - good arch support like you could expect from Adidas shoes. However, the cheap fabric inside wrinkles and bends very fast. It might be acceptable for a $40 pair but these were priced at solid $59.99 mark."
3,Westar EM8603 Engine Mount,"This part was manufactured well, priced right, but was missing a critical alignment slot to mesh with a tang located on the stationary part of the support welded on the automobile.I had to modify the part to make it line up. I am sure it was an oversight of the manufacturer's but the part will not work without modification."
4,Introduction To Mathematical Techniques Used In GIS,"I learnt a lot from reading this book. It begins with a simple introduction of the basic but necessary mathematical tools required to understand how GIS software tools and concepts operate. This understanding opens up new opportunities for users to code new functions into the API's that are becoming standard fare of many of the commercial spatial software.However, the intensity of the contents climb steeply in the middle chapters and the unfocused reader can easily be lost amongst the concepts. Making it to the end of the book will bring a new realization about how our GIS really operates. One good feature is that the chapters are very short and concise, so by the time you are bored, the chapter comes to an end and you can reflect back in sensemaking mode. This is a very understandable book to those who take the patience to read it."
1,Wrong Part,I ordered this part for the window on my jeep wrangler TJ which it is supposed to fitI received the part and it is not the same shape or the same size
1,Xacto Blade,Use X-acto blades a lot and did not have to go shopping for it. Free freight and low price. Wonerful
5,"Love it, works great , lasts long","Its original equipment and has lots of power and lasts awhile.I am a light user, not a construction worker.10-10-2010Its still going strong .. great battery. Lasted longer than the originals I think"
4,A professionals Tool,I to am glad that they haven't changed there design for the way it locks in. I would choose the sliding option over this but I have many Dewalt tools and the batteries are interchangable....A very big plus.
2,joey d,"I received this battery without any plastic cover to protect the metal prongs.There were paper strips attached to the bottom of the battery. It took me along time to remove them. I cannot tell if this is a new battery. When Ipurchase a NiCd battery in the future, I will make sure that it is encased inplastic. It is worth the difference in price."
5,LOVE!!!,"got this for free via amazon when i bought the ""DEWALT DC411KA 18-Volt Cordless 4-1/2-Inch Cut-Off Tool"" this is just the battery no charger and packaging was great... (managed to get 3 batteries: 2 that came with the tool and this one here... just a few extra clicks)"
3,Good battery for 2-3 years,"I have 6-7 18V Dewalt batteries, both XRP and the original black ones. They have worked great for awhile with light use, but consistently turn into paperweights around the 3 year mark even though I bring them in from the cold garage in the winter. This means a constant expense to keep your wireless tools running."
4,Unrealistic Prices?,I like this battery pack as I normally get several years of use out of each pack. These are available from many sources however at less than 30% of this list price.
4,Battery,DeWalt battery doesn't seem to be much different or longer lasting than less expensive portable tools provide and yet this battery is more expensive.
4,batteries,The service was very good and the product arrived in a very timely manner. I was disappointed that they were of the older series of batteries but they do the job.
5,"Best price, fastest shipping! Great batteries","DeWalt tools are some of the best out there. When one of my tools with the battery was stolen I was pretty peeved. Batteries were about $110 a piece plus tax from local brick and mortar merchants, but then I decided to check on Amazon and boy am I glad I did. Item is brand new in retail packaging and works just fine. As a bonus, now I have another battery cap. I seem to always lose those..."
5,Good value for extra battery,Not a whole lot to say here. It is a good extra battery for all of your 18 volt DeWalt tools. It is always helpful to have a battery on the charger while you are working a project so you avoid downtime.
3,DeWalt18 volt battery,So far so good. The 18volt batt that came with my nice impact diver only lasted about 1 year before it would not hold much charge. Hopefully this one does better!
2,dewalt dc9096 xrp batterys,"i bought a lot of thease batterys and i had nothing but trouble with them thay dont last very long , the battery after awile wont take a long charge , and you start getting short runtime, i took the battery apart and test the cslls there would always be one or 2 bad cells , i would replace the 2 cells and go on ,for awile then thay would go out again , just not good batterys , so i got rid of the 18 volt line and went to the lithium battery 36 volt and thay take a charge over and over what a differance and the run time is 3 times longer , the end results are dont use nicd batterys GO LITHIUM"
4,"Seems pricey, but considering the lifespan, good value","This battery works as it should and keeps a charge through most home improvement projects. As much as I want to complain about the price of a replacement battery, it really isn't that bad considering the previous one lasted over 5 years."
5,Dewalst 18 volt Battery,"When I received the battery it was charged, which i guess is a good thing. I put it on my charger for 2 hrs. It seens sto hold the charge well. How long the battery will last is the real test, which I don't have a answer."
4,As expected - case showed wear,These batteries are necessary evils and rebuilt ones are just as much as new ones....? This case showed some scratches on the bottom but it seems new and was sealed in a case.
5,Works great,"The replacement batteries for my DeWalt DC9096 18v 1/2"" Hammer Drill work great. I am very satisfied."
4,Dewalt XRP battery,I bought it as a backup battery for my nailer as it only comes with one battery. It took a charge but I have not had to use it so far.
4,It's a battery,"Arrived in a timely manner. Threw it in the charger, plugged it in to my drill, it worked. Having only done that, there's really not much to be said."
4,get a new one,"The batteries work fine. if your spending money on batteries for this, old, tool, dont do it. Spend the money on a new, lighter, stronger, tool set. I wish I would have... Get a hitachi set if your low on cash, they work great."
1,HORRIBLE,"If you use the batteries in different chargers(chargers with the same model number), it will kill the battery. I bought a drill set with charger, and it worked well enough for a while, but when the drill started getting worn out, I purchased a replacement drill kit. Same model number, thinking I would now have twice as many batteries. The new charger just killed the old batteries. This has happened with other kits that use the ""Same"" charger as well. Same charger, same model number.I will no longer buy DeWalt products. I am replacing them as they wear out with Makita products which are lighter, cheaper, and the batteries are far better."
2,Overpriced,The Battery is operable but way ovrpriced. I guess when it goes bad you just throw away the vacuum or use the power cord. These batteries are all overpriced which makes them very uneconomical in the long run
3,saw ran in reverse,great deal great brand but the frigging saw ran in reverse I'm glad I had two hands on the wheel! Amazon handled the exchange perfectly! Probably should have rated 1 star but the brand name and Amazon earned it 3 stars....
1,I wasted my time and money on this,"In two words, ""It sucks."" The movies were boring and out of date. I would never purchase this item again. I guess I got what I paid for."
1,more to a book than a title,"Just a poorly written book with some good facts, but not put together well. It felt after a while that the author was just writing about how he was invloved and really liked it. I think some points should have been more stressed. The relationship between Kosovars and Albania Albanians on a lower level than politicians. The shock of Kosovars seeing the poverty in Albania and the anger towards them from their kin in that poor country. Writing about politicians and what they did is just documenting what was for public consumption. And to the reviewer before me.. if this was propganda, then it was very poor propaganda. A greater Albania or any Country in the Balkans can make sense on paper, but reality can be a bitch. So read it with a beer and a grain of salt.. step away and have another beer. Nothing special here."
1,False False False,"Went throught it, very poorly written from a pro-albanian perspective. Now if you go to a search Engine and put in Greater Albania, you'll get journalists reporting facts and Profesors political analytical points of views on facts that will give you a much more professional insight into the subject. Just don't bother buying this, its only worth burning it in the fireplace to keep warm."
1,Wrong Product,"The item bought was a battery 3.7 V 1900 mA , and came a battery 3.7V 1500 mA , but the worst thing is the battery doesn't work properly, it shows bad contact in the camera , and turn off the camera. The problem is due to difference in the electric contacts , in this battery the contacts are deep then the original one . The original one works properly and has no problem. I bought this one like a spare but now...."
5,Love it!!,I'm in average shape and wanted a routine that would compliment my dressage riding.This video is really great! It really helped me realize how important core strength is to support the enitre body.I find it challanging - which so many workout videos are at first but I lose interest - not this one.I'm going to look for some more ballet videos to try!
4,your legs will shake,"i wanted to try a different workout and someone suggested ballet. i have never done ballet but seeing as how this video got such rave reviews, i decided to give it a try. it's a tough lower body workout and while there are no upper body exercises, you will realize by the end of the video that your arms are sore from holding them up the entire time. great workout for core as well and helps with posture."
4,Great Leg & Ab Workout,I grew up dancing and love this DVD. It's a great leg and ab workout and it's also fun. It doesn't require any equipment and you can do it in a fairly small space at home.
3,Sooooo Boring,"Ok,I've taken a ballet class before just for fun and I thought this would be a good way to keep those basics with me at home to keep me tone. This dvd has alot of the same basic moves from the class I took, but the difference is THIS DVD IS BORING! It's a ""Ballet Inspired"" workout and I knew that when I oredered it which is fine, but I was yawning half way into it.I think it's because the music it is set to sounds like sleepy time music rather than upbeat or classical piano for barre work. If you can follow along without verbal instruction,then I highly suggest plugging into your mp3 player and use your own ballet music for this.That's just my opinion. Other than that it is a good way to stretch out and I'll use it as a warmup for my other workouts."
4,The first few times it was a challenge to complete but it's fun!,I really like this DVD. At the beginning it was hard to for me as a beginner. The first time I only completed the first 15 minutes and my arms were in pain but I don't workout regularly. After the fifth time I was able to complete the workout. The movements are very elegant and I felt like a real ballerina it's fun to do and the movements are easy to follow.
4,"Great, Challenging workout","I just purchased this DVD after reading a recommendation in Shape Magazine. Just by looking at the video you it doesn't look difficult and very easy but it's actually a challenging workout. The instructor is great too, she is make it easy to follow."
3,Fitness or Ballet?,"I've been searching for a way to get back into ballet that would still work with my crazy schedule, so I have been searching out videos that might provide a solid Barre experience. This is a bit more fitness focused than hard core ballet, but still a good overall, ballet inspired workout. I would recomment to persons wanting a good core workout but not to die hard bun heads."
3,"NOT class-like, nice scenery, boring music, good more as a stretch","This is not a class-type ballet dvd, it's more like, the western-hollywood version of what we think the ballet should be. If you want a real ballet DVD i suggest Dmitri Roudnev (they are available here on amazon). They aren't nearly as good in quality, but you get the true feeling of a class...so it depends what you want. I think this one is nice if you are new to ballet. Overall it's good, but not a class.The music is SO boring! Yet the scenery is nice - most ballet dvds are in the studio, so this was a nice change. The girl is ok, her voice is either love it or leave it, I think.Overall, I only spend 9 bucks on it, so i think if i use it twice it's worth it...however for me personally it's not something I could do multiple times a week like some others say. But again, for me personally, I'm more used to a real class setting, so that probably has something to do with it."
4,gentle yet effective,"I've been doing weights, cardio and varied classes for years(tae bo, body sculpt) so this was a refreshing change of pace. But the effort of making one's arms look graceful, of controlling the leg and not just kicking out, and maintaining posture without arching the back--- WHEW! Loved it! The instructor gives precise instructions and motivated me when I thought my legs would give out. I'll take this video over squats and lunges any day."
5,Good for experienced dancers,"This video does not explain technique so I would recommend it to anyone who has had some ballet experience.Video starts with a quick warm up then a ""barre routine"" using a chair for balance and ends with some jumps and floor exercises. I'm not in shape and its been many years since my last ballet class. I only made it through the first 15 minutes my first time but it felt good."
4,Hard workout,"It is a surprisingly hard workout. I have always wanted to join a ballet class, never had the chance though. When i bought the dvd i was so excited. Within the first 5 minutes I had to stop, it was very challenging. Now I understand why ballerinas have such a toned body. I workout at least 5 days a week and this workout made me realize I still can be challenged and have a great workout in my living room. The instructor is great, I am pleased with this DVD."
5,My legs love this video,"I got this because I was always so jealous of ballet dancers' legs! The first couple times I did it, it was a definite challenge even though my legs were pretty in shape. The balance and grace required to do the moves like Elise does them are challenging and add depth to the workout. Overall, my legs are stronger and more flexible because of this workout. There is an awesome ab section too that gets really deep into the muscles and is still hard for me after doing many times."
5,One of my favorites,"I have several workout DVD's, but this is by far one of my favorites. I've never taken ballet, but am an avid, intermediate-to-advanced level exerciser. Over the years I've tried several different workout routines and I tend to get intrigued by new fitness methods and ideologies, often to be disappointed. This workout is an exception. I'm not sure why, but I feel just plain good when I'm done ~ I stand taller, feel (if not look) graceful, and am more aware of my body and posture. If you're looking for intense, high-impact, serious sweat-inducing cardio, this is not for you. But if you want a lovely, fluid, yet challenging workout that will build lean muscle strength, increase balance, and leave you feeling serene and relaxed, try this one. Another note: I'm picky about my instructors and let me say, Elise is a darling ~ she's encouraging but never patronizing, and she doesn't irk me in the slightest."
3,Great workout!,"I have always loved ballet, but have never formally taken classes. I knew some of the terms from previous exercise programs (pilates, etc.)... but that wasn't needed. The instructor thoroughly explains what each move is, and over the next 50 minutes takes you on a complete muscle workout! I never thought moving so slowly through a movement could be so powerful."
5,relaxing and effective,This workout helps to burn calories and relax at the same time. The movements are elegant and powerful. The abs are hard!
4,Beautiful but a little boring,"I am new to exercise (yes I'm one of those new year exercisers everyone hates!) and wanted to make my mostly skinny body into a fit and skinny body. I went to this tape to hope for long lean muscles but I couldn't go through with it! It was beautiful and she looks gorgeous while doing the exercises but it was too boring for me :( The only not boring part would be the jumps, but most of the time I can't do those in my apartment without disturbing others. I probably won't try it again. I used to be a gymnast and still do yoga, so flexibility wasn't an issue. The other tape I got with this one,Exhale: Core Fusion Body Sculpt, was much better. I enjoyed the fact that the workouts were brief but effective. I recommend that for a similar workout that is a little more interesting!"
5,Great Workout,"This video is a great workout! This was my first barre exercise video, and I loved this one. She has you stand just like a ballet dancer. She moves slow enough so you can keep up, but fast enough to make your heart pump. She has you hold your arms in proper ballet form. The next few days after doing this video, my muscles were tired. It's a great video!!!"
5,Pleased as Punch!,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this dvd, I just wanted to add something a little different to my collection of work-out dvds. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the instructor wasn't at all annoying, like some I've come across. (I do own quite a few fitness dvds.) The work out was -very- challenging, in a good way. I made it through and was just dripping with sweat from my efforts. The next three days I was very sore through my thighs, but I couldn't wait to try the dvd again. I've recommended it to my sisters and all of my friends interested in fitness dvds. I am going to be buying a second copy to gift to my younger sister who recently got engaged and is fretting about losing a few pounds before the big day next summer. Try this dvd out! I really think you're going to love it.I will say, I'm not an advanced fitness buff at all. I am just getting back into working out so I would probably rate myself as a beginner. This is a great dvd to really get you into fitness."
2,Eh...,I was really excited about this one but it's not that great. I stopped after about 10 minutes because I was pretty bored with the routine. I also agree with the other people that it hurts your knees!
4,good work out/annoying commentary,"It's a good workout, even for graceless klutzes like me. You feel it in your legs immediately and the ab workout is really intense, although it helps to have taken some pilates classes before hand b/c the presenter doesn't explain form so well. Obviously, it's more important to be told to smile and to honestly express your practice (whatever that means--I think it's a euphemism for ""you're out of shape and totally inflexible"") than how to do the exercise right."
4,Wonderful but tough!,"I have never done ballet before in my life, but I was looking for a dvd that could help me lean up and elongate since i am short. The work is difficult, especially for a beginner, but the instructor constantly reminds you that it is ok to do the exercises to the best of your ability as it is the ""intention"" of the movement that works. I could feel muscles working that I don't think i've used before, and I felt really accomplished when i was done. My only complaint is that she KEPT TALKING!!! the entire time. She was very motivating and what she said was not annoying, but still, i would have appreciated a silent moment or two to help focus. I look forward to the results of this dvd!"
5,"fantastic way to tone those ""soft"" muscles","i haven't done any type of ballet or dance in years, and i purchased this after a recommendation in my shape magazine. i was not disappointed. it definitely uses all the muscles in your body to tone, AND actually gets the heart rate up! i was actually sore after my first workout!! the exercises build upon each other, so you can easily track your progress. i would recommend this to anyone who is looking to tone and build muscles!"
3,Kinda boring,"Why do I choose to ignore reviews, just hoping that I will like it anyway? The whole thing is more new agish instead of a ballet feel. The recorded voice is slow and annoying. The music was annoying. They didn't get good close ups or even that good of voice instruction. I got through it okay, and even though I was sore later (good sore!) I think I would rather try my daughter's Tinkerbell Ballet next time!"
3,ok,"The sender was ggreat - no complaints there, but the dvd is boring and not challenging - I am not convinced I can stick with it as I doubt it will produce results"
1,A Waste of Money,"This is not a conditioning class; it's simply a beginning ballet class taught by a very average ballet dancer. I wouldn't even recommend it to a beginner ballet student because you're liable to pick up some bad habits like sticking out your thumbs, and not working through your feet, both of which the teacher does routinely. And she doesn't have any business talking about how to develop the long, lean look of a dancer -- which she does ad nauseum -- since that's not the type of body she has. She has a nice figure, but it's definitely not a ballet dancer's body. If she has primarily been using dance as her means of exercise (as she implies) then she's been using her quadriceps to lift her legs into developpe, which is a definite no-no. If she comes out with an actual conditioning DVD, that might be good, but this one has no redeeming value to me."
1,Annoying and disappointing,"I studied ballet intensely when young and was looking for a video to bring back the joy of doing a barre to classical music. The annoying sound track of this is matched by the instructor's robotic personality. There is no vigor or energy here and the tone is condescending. For ballet, look elsewhere! Sorry!"
3,Meh.,"I didn't care for this one too much. The thing that bothers me the most is that the instructors thighs are amazingly bulky, which is NOT something you see on ballet dancers. That put me off. I thought, ""if i do these exercises, am I gonna have Charles Atlas thighs?"" I also didn't like the fact that while it is based on ballet moves, they don't really tell you much about the moves themselves- is this based on a battement tendu? I want to know these things which is why I gravitated towards a workout with ballet in the title. I will say, however, that I did break a sweat, and felt like I was gonna barf about halfway through. This can be good and bad. It means its a very tough workout- and it also means that I won't complete the whole thing. I decided to go with the Lotte Berk method and I am glad I did. I just don't want those bodybuilder thighs!"
3,ballet workout,"An excellent workout, but I would like some short options to get started.Then, work up to the long workout."
4,It's just OK...,"I did enjoy this video but that's because I enjoy ballet. As a new stay-at-home-mom I was looking for a way to feel motivated to do ballet without having to leave my living room. (I used to dance years ago). This was just not enough for me. I was looking for more than bar exercises. I already know how to do this kind of workout at home and was looking for something that was a tiny bit more challenging. I also did not like that she wasn't even in ballet style clothing, like the cover leads you to believe. It does motivate me though to at least stretch my legs a bit but if you know anything about ballet, it might not be worth it."
3,not good for my knees,I was wanting a ballet type workout to benefit my belly dancing. this wasn't it. it hurt my knees and she didn't give enough alternatives for someone who ISN't in ballet and doesn't want to get deep into Ballet class. it hurt my knees really bad even when I wasn't trying to go that far.for me- its not a good workout. I had to take a break for several days cuz of how bad it hurt.I would recommend something that mixed ballet and something else. the best of ballet with the best of callanetics but w/o the pain.
2,"ok, not very challenging","I don't understand all the positive reviews. I like these type of workouts (big fan of Cardio Fusion and Lotte Berk), but this one didn't do anything.I wish it would have been more challenging, usually after the first time on a good workout DVD, I can feel it somewhat the next day."
5,wonderful DVD for very reasonable price,"If you are like me who has no dancing history, mid-aged, but looking for a comprehensive workout with grace, this is the first and best one to be choosen. dancer is so gorgeous, intruction is clear, video is beautifully made. It is a such joy to follow her exercise everyday. In this DVD, mostly is stationary movement, I am really looking forward to see more her ballet workout DVD with more moving flows, the conbination of movements in it. if so, I will certainly buy it as well."
5,GREAT WORKOUT!,"I truly love this dvd, great for everybody, i do it with my mom & dad, we all have fun!"
4,"Good burn, minimal sweat","This is a solid workout for toning, lengthening, and balancing. It's fun and not too long. It's essentially a basic barre class with some pilates at the end. I did it for the first time yesterday and am really feeling it today - it's hard to sit down, but in a good way. I know if I keep at it it will make a difference in my body! My only dissapointment is that I did not break much of a sweat. Would be great after a two mile run."
3,Not a beginner's video,"I know I took a risk when I read the reviews, but I had the hope that from the good ones that it would work for me. Well the first thing I noticed was that it was definitely for someone with ballet experience. The instructor goes pretty fast in displaying the steps. For someone with zero experience this was hard to do. But from what I saw I think it would be excellent for those with a ballet background as a toning video."
1,Boring,I used to take ballet and those classes were a lot more fun. I was expecting to get the same motivation I would receive in a class... but this was blah...
4,ballet conditioning,"I LIKE THIS BALLET CONDITIONING VIDEO VERY MUCH IT CAN ALSO BE USED AS A SORT OF WARMING UP, COOLING DOWN OR STRETCHING EXERCISE FOR EXAMPLE BEFORE STARTING WITH CARDIO EXERCISES OR WALKING ON THE TREADMILL."
5,Ballet Conditioning,"I bought this DVD after it was recommended in Shape magazine, even though I have never done ballet of any type. It is an excellent work out, more for toning than cardio. After just three or four times through I can see and feel a difference in my strength and flexibility doing the movements. I would definitely recommend to a friend!"
5,Terrific! But don't forget your mat.,"This is a nice workout for me at home. I go to the gym about twice a week for group fitness classes and run on and off. I wanted something that would help my core strength and give me some more stretching. Not too much stretching in this one, but I was surprised at how challenging the moves were (I've never been a dancer). At 38, I can use this...and I would do this DVD as often as I could to get a physique like this lady.My only recommendation for this is a use of a yoga mat for the ab work. I don't know how her spine doesn't bother her on that floor she's using, but once I used my mat all was well."
5,Ballet Conditioning,Beautiful scenery! The first half hour is a great workout. Great for improving posture and balance. The last part was more for the advanced. It will take time to get to that level of flexibility and strength. I am enjoying it and would recommend it.
3,Limited targeted popular,"Got this DVD with Jennifer Galardi's Ballet body.Element: Ballet Conditioning reuqires muscle strength that a moderate active woman doesn't have while the content is too simple to the professional dancers. I do like Elise Gulan's coaching style and the music, but this DVD only suitable for limited population.Compared to that, Ballet body is more diverse, fun, achievable, chair free, and it allows me to have a sweaty work out with 1 inch narrower waist in a week."
1,Not good,These workouts are too short to be beneficial. It says its an hour long but I don't know where the other footage went.
3,A little boring,This video does give you a good workout but to me the video was a little sleepy. I was sweating by the end of the video but it didn't leave me excited to do this work out again. All in all a good workout so if you don't mind slow paced music this is a great video.
3,Not really ballet,"This video is really more of a fusion of ballet, Pilates and yoga than straight ballet: it's not like the ballet classes I remember. The music is cheesy, new age garbage. I don't understand why they couldn't use a more classical ballet score.The exercises are difficult if you are out of shape like I am. This is partly caused by the slowness of the exercises (like yoga). There is very little movement---she seems to be concentrating much more on ""core"" (as in Pilates) than dance. This is a workout, not a prep for dancing. I wish I could find a more classical dvd that's really based on ballet."
3,"Nice workout, annoying music","The reason I'm posting this review is because I bought this DVD based on Mercy Oceans' review saying that the music is ""elevator music."" It's not that I like elevator music, it's just that elevator music can be ignored, and this music has too much of a beat to be ignored. So, if you find music with a boring repetitious beat annoying, be forewarned: This not only isn't nice classical music, it's not neutral either. I've adopted the same solution as the previously mentioned reviewer; MUTE it and listen to something else. The workout itself is fine, although I'm sure I was missing some of the nuances with the mute button on. I do recommend this workout unless you dislike music with a steady thump. Also, I don't know if it's just the camera angle, but the instructor seems to have very large thighs for a ballet dancer. I was probably focusing on the wrong things because of the MUTE situation."
5,Product was as promised,The product was shipped promptly and arrived in excellent condition. This DVD is quite intense and it may be quite difficult for new dancers. However it is a great workout!
5,Very nice DVD.,"I've NEVER taken a dance class in my life. I played softball instead of going to ballet or tap classes like my friends. Just recently I became interested in how dancers move, and condition their bodies for performance. I like this DVD because, while I'm not very graceful or as flexible as the instructor, afterward I feel relaxed and stronger. While doing the workouts I feel just the right about of strain without feeling bored or overwhelmed. It's a nice change of routine. I'm glad I came across this DVD.Don't be intimidated by not being able to raise your legs as high as Elise, or move as graceful as she does. I was at first, but I feel with repeated practice, I'll get just as good! :-)"
3,Challenging workout but might disappoint a former ballet dancer,"First of all, I grew up with the Vaganova ballet system and danced for over 15 years and am therefore used to a very clean and strict execution of ballet exercises - Elise Gulan has a lot of strength and stamina but I was and still am very surprised to hear that she used to be a classical dancer: The way she carries out some of the typical ballet exercises is way too sloppy for my liking; I believe that is also the reason why her leg muscles appear to be overly bulky on the thighs (you won't ever see that on a female Russian dancer for example. It's a sign for using incorrect turnout over years and as a result the muscles aren't stretched properly).However, her ballet conditioning is challenging and certainly strength building - if done properly - and therefore I'm giving it 3 stars. Also I would have appreciated classical music in the background."
3,"Good leg workout, but boring","This is definitely a toning video, not cardio, although you will probably feel your heart rate pick up. I expected something a little more ""dancerly,"" but it's basically a lot of squats, repetitive leg movements, and plie-calf raises. A decent leg workout, but not engaging at all. I probably will not do this video very often."
4,Felt like ballet class -- wish worked glutes more,"I liked this. I definitely feel the burn after doing it, although, never in my rear. I do feel it in my legs, but that's really it. This workout does go by really quickly and it is the one workout I have found that comes incredibly close to a real ballet class, and I really appreciate that. Especially compared to other workout videos I have used. I personally cannot get through the NY Ballet workout. So Boring. This one has a great pace. Heartrate gets going, but on a fat burn speed, not really cardio. All in all, it's part of my routine and I like it."
5,Great workout,I love this workout! It's challenging and fun. Easy to follow and beautiful setting. So glad I got it! I am someone who works out often but still found this challenging
5,Excellent Ballet workout DVD for any level,"The movements were very easy to follow, yet challenging enough where you will struggle & be sweating. Ex. grand plie in releve. Other movements are in the center (without support) & require a bit of balance. The production is top notch. Beautiful picturesque background, excellent sound & clear camera angles. Modern. I will be ordering another DVD for a friend who has no ballet experience but is into fitness."
5,Fantastic!,"I usually HATE workout dvds but, after seeing how many people had given this one a good review, I had to try it. I'm glad I did because I LOVE it!!!"
5,Ballet video,"Wonderful video! As I started doing it, I thought, this isn't going to do anything...but I was sore for about a week!! It's a great low impact workout, and it gets the whole body! I love it!"
5,Wow!,"I've done this workout every other day for the last two weeks and it's awesome! It kicks my butt every time. You feel it working every muscle of your lower body and also your back. The abs section at the end is also extremely challenging and effective. So far only I have noticed the changes in my muscles, but I know that after a few weeks, everyone else will see the changes in my body as well. I'm looking forward to any new workout DVDs by Elise. I also own her yoga video but I honestly haven't tried it yet."
5,A MUST HAVE!,THIS IS SIMPLY THE BEST COLLECTION OF SCOTTISH GAELIC PRESENTING ON CD. MURDINA AND EFFIE MACDONALD (TRACKS 1&2) WERE REGARDED AS BEING SOME OF THE FINEST PSALM SINGERS IN GAELIC SCOTLAND AND THE FIRST 2 SELECTIONS ARE WONDERFUL DISPLAYS OF THEIR TALENT. THE SOUND IS CLEAR AND THE SELECTION OF TUNES APPROPRAITE AND COMPREHENSIVE. A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN GAELIC SONG.
4,THIS WRITER IS A RAT AND ONE OF THE FEW AND BEST!!!,"THIS STORY DOES FOR ME WHAT FEW BOOKS DO, IT HAS MULTIPLE THREADS AND THEMES TO THE PLOT. THE VARIOUS PEOPLE IN THE STORY ARE LEAPING OFF THE PAGE AND TAKE ON A LIFE OF THEIR OWN. THE STORY LINE THAT INVOLVES THE LABOR STRUGGLE AND THE BLENDING AND WEAVING OF VIETNAM BACKROUND IS AWESOME. HE BASES THE STORY IN A SMALL TOWN THAT COULD BE ANYWHERE MID AMERICA, USES JUST ABOUT EVERY RACIAL BACKROUND YOU COULD IN ONE STORY. BUT HE DID NOT STOP THERE, HE ALSO PUT IN SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND POLITICAL STRATA. THIS BOOK WILL HOLD YOUR INTREST AND THE STORY IS PRETTY GOOD, THE ONLY THING THAT HE FLOUNDERED IN WAS THE SPIRITUAL SIDE OF THINGS AND IN THE RELIGIOUS INVOLVMENT AFTER DEATH. KEEP WRITING."
5,There can be no one-line summary,"I am normally a ""skip-reader"". I could not do so with this book. I learned a tremendous amount about the concept of the Vietnam war that was so much a part of my life. I want to know more. Is there another book by this author?"
4,A thriller!,"Except for the premise of three Vietnam Vets being able to dig connecting tunnels throughout the city by themselves over several years silently and without significant equipment and keeping it a secret, which I found hard to accept, the novel is a good read. Interesting characters. Good plot. Good prose. You won't regret this read!"
5,Flynn Creates Incredible Characters!,"I have read 8 Joseph Flynn books and have enjoyed each of the them immensely. The characters are realistic and interesting, but most of all, they really come alive in his books. The stories are fantastic, too. Flynn has replaced Robert B. Parker as my favorite author!"
5,I think it's great,"I do low voltage installations, I use this mostly for intercom/entry installations. I have been on my own 7 years and am now on my 2nd one. I ABUSE them pretty good. I have used it to drill 1/2 holes through new brick(I know go through the morter, but cant always do that) I have put 3/4 holes through cement block. Used a 2 1/2 hole saw through 2x4...OK get the idea. I'm not saying anyone should do more than it's rated for, but lets face it in real life sometimes things happen This is something every one should own, would probably last a lifetime for a moderate user. I STRONGLY recomend getting them service every year or so. My first one lasted about 4 years, until the body finally cracked and wouldn't hold the battery anymore. Plus the 988 is compact enough to fit between joists w/ a 1"" bit on it"
3,maxtool review,"product was almost exactly what i wanted, dewalt 18v hammer/drill/driver was great and delivery prompt and better than expected delivery date. but as selling to international clients maxtool could/should disclose more information about battery charger input voltage (as australia is different to united states)output voltages mentioned in detals. minor detail but some small details are important."
1,What is up with this drill?,"First. I have a workshop, barn and truck bed full of Dewalt tools and I would give every one of them a five or four rating. But this drill was nothing but problems for me and I returned it. The chuck adjustment was terrible, the speed(transmission switch) would not stay locked in position and the final straw was the distinctive sound of metal on metal and a wisp of smoke. This was within the first five hours of use. Given the number of great reviews this drill gets I am willing to accept that I got a lemon. I was not willing to take my chances on another. Just returning the drill is a long trip for me and we need tools that we can rely on. Our work is often done way ""off the paved road"" for you Foxworthy fans. A competitors product in the same price range has been used and abused for a month now and is going great. Sounds like Dewalt has some real quality control issues on this drill. If you buy one hope you get one of the five star drills and not a one star like I did."
2,7 pages of errata - RIDICULOUS,"There are 7 PAGES of errata for this title. http://www.artechhouse.com/GetBLOB.asp?Name=leach%20errata.pdfMany of the critical figures are simply broken. Figure 3.2 for example is supposed to contrast a critical chain project chart with a critical path project chart, but the figures are identical.This severely degrades the utility of this book. I just called Artech House (publisher) and they stated that as of Dec 16, 2005 there is NOT a printing of the book out that corrects these egregious errors. This is ridiculous given the severity of the errors and the fact that it was printed in February 2005.Aside from that, the content of the book is good."
4,Another good management guide,Having experience of managing strategical project I find the approach of critical chain very useful and highly applicable. Specially after reading this book I was able to clearly define the main points of this approach where I have just felt it before. It helped me to understand in more analytic way the process of project forming and managing. Really appreciable.
5,Highly Recommend!!,This book was great. Finally a book that shows an easy way to incorporate pilates into my workout both at home and in the gym. I already can see and feel the results.
1,Waste of money and time,"I figured ""for $x, I'll gamble."" I lost.This is basically a bikini contest and a lingerie contest from some Los Angeles clubs. There's no flashing in either. The lingerie contest has a little suggestive dancing, but the bikini contest is just girls walking up and down a stage.Forget PG-13, this is almost PG. The closest you get to nudity is a brief glimpse of a bare bottom in an interlude scene. Otherwise everything is covered.If you like scantily clad women walking around, then you'll enjoy this. If you want some nudity or at least a little heat, don't waste your money."
5,Robotic electro,"I've just listened to this album for the first time. The second that I played the first song I was blown away. The smooth electrosounds mixed with robotic hard, is amazingly beautiful and every song gives me goose bumps. Listen to this album and become as happy as me."
1,Not as it appears,"I was very excited to find this listed on Amazon, because my dog recently destroyed my daughter's Hillary Hedgehog, and I was excited to find a replacement! Unfortunately, the product delivered to me does not look like the photo above. The face and chest are covered with a different fabric -- more of a fleece-type fabric, like the feet in the photo above. I'm truly disappointed."
2,Not so great,"This doll has TERRIBLE hair. The more the child plays with it, the worse it looks. Additionally, the tiara is sewn to the doll's head, so loose ""locks"" of hair have to constantly be tucked back in. I finally had to remove the tiara and give the doll a haircut to appease my daughter."
3,not the greatest,"My daughter loves Dora, so she loves the doll. But the quality is poor. The hair is secured by the tiara and if it comes loose it exposes a painted bald head. You have to keep tucking the hair back through. I'm just letting my daughter play with it fully expecting it to not last very long. It was a gift and I am dissapointed that her grandmother spent $15 on this. Way overpriced."
1,Disappointing Dora Doll,"The doll is very small, its hands and legs are tiny and disproportionate compared to the big head. It cannot stand on its own and except forthe head the rest is made from cloth. I am disappointed in the quality of this product. I was expecting a bigger and better doll."
3,Nice try,"I like that this is a real toner laser printer as opposed to one of those wax-type printers and that it is pretty fast. Drivers are OK but could use some help (I'm using win2000). Of course the price is great for a color laser!Didn't like that it is kinda loud - can't print after family goes to bed! Also, it is not picture quality. The colors are sometimes WAY off, the drivers have no adjustment for this and the quality is like a magazine print - nasty dot effect. Finally, the toner rubs off on light colors! Really wierd.In conclusion, I should have bought a simple B&W laser and a color Inkjet Photo printer to serve my needs. My wife says I'm not allowed to make this sort of purchase anymore and is confiscating the credit cards after this one! :-)"
1,Taking it back,"HP misses the mark on this one. Took hours to set up. Could not connect with USB on Windows XP. ""24 hour"" HP tech support closes at 5. Clearing paper jams requires removing major components. The unit churns, clangs, and roars like a beast. Print quality is okay, however."
2,Big and Noisy,"I now have 4 printers in my office: HP LaserJet 4000 (black & white), HP LaserJet 3330 MFP (fax and copy), Epson 960 (CD printing) and this HP 2500L.Extremely satisfied with my HP LaserJet 4000 and 3330 MFP, I thought I would be happy with this HP 2500L too. But, two days after having it, I'm disappointed. It is huge and noisy.When printing, this 2500L is like a small army marching. I'm surprised that no one has complained about this. I'm wondering if it is because my other three, the HP 4000 and 3330 and Epson 960, are simply too quiet.Comapring to my Epson 960, which is just an inkjet and much slower, I consider Epson 960's print quality superior than my HP 2500L's.However, HP 2500L is pretty fast and its price is very reasonable. Moreover, a laserjet's per page printing cost is much lower than an inkjet's."
3,"Big and Noisy, but Reliable and Cost Effective","I've had this printer since it first came out, and while it's big, ugly, noisy and takes a while to process stuff (and it also has the nasty habit of suddenly and noisily coming to life for some sort of adjustments-which drives overnight guests in my office/guest room nuts), it's also quite reliable and I've yet to change toner cartridges. I had extra memory installed, so have never had any problems printing anything. The color is a bit too bright, but otherwise, I've been pretty happy with it."
3,"Decent, but disturbingly ugly","The perfomance on this printer is very good, and what i would expect from an HP. But the apperance is totally disgusting. EWWW, i cringe thinking about how ugly it is... I can stand it... i covered it with a pillow case cause it was so ugly."
2,Not good,"Condition was not 'good' as specified. The soft back was broken in several places. The book had a label from the Erie County, NY Public Library which made me wonder about how the dealer got it."
3,"Where is ""the Guitar Pop of '1974'?""","I ordered this CD Single only to find that it is not what the ""Album Details"" say it is.** The actual tracklist is as follows:One: RadioTwo: Northern TownThree: Radio (Sam La More Jumpin' Radio Mix)+ Gallery and video clips**NOTE: There is no other ""B-side"" on this single (""the Guitar Pop of '1974'"")."
3,Kind of disappointed!,"Was'nt exactly what I expected. There must be two versions to this CD. The tracts are not the same as the CD listed on Amazon.There are 16 like the other one, but a lot of the songs are different. All are vocal. I would'nt buy this CD unless you can get it really cheap and you are willing to get a CD that is different from the one listed. Has good sound but is not my style."
5,Wonderful CD and the nicest person,"This CD is a classic. Patricia has a clear pure voice, which sounds wonderful on all of these songs. She puts so much emotion into the songs. She visited the University of South Florida, where I had a changed to meet her. She is the sweetest person. She sang many of these songs for her recital. I highly recommend this CD. Her voice is not like most classical singers. Her vibrato doesn't control her voice, and it shines. Get it! If she ever comes to your town, do yourself a favor and go see her. She's worth it!"
3,A Worthwhile Effort,"Although the humor is a little childish and cartoonish at times, it was meant to be! In this Tashlin outing, Martin and Lewis team together again in a light and entertaining spoof of censorship and comic book culture. The Cold War plot thrown in at the end is timely, though out of place, in an otherwise exceptionally goofy live action cartoon."
4,Rare Martin & Lewis find,"This is a delightful romp with funny situations and good songs. My favorite Martin & Lewis movie, and one of the first movies of Shirley MacLaine."
5,A live DVD done perfectly.,I couldn't have alked for more out of this DVD. long set great production. awesome setlist. the only thing possibly missing for me was cathode ray sunshine. If you love DT dont hesitate to pick this up.
3,An Overview of Gangs,"This book adds missing data for those who are interested in the study of gangs. While a few books have discussed gangs in Europe, this book also looks at the existing literature on gangs in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It uses Malcolm Klein's definition of gangs to decide which are ""true"" street gangs and which are organized crime or other illicit groups. This method is both the book's strength and its weakness. The line between what the author calls a ""true street gang"" and other illicit groups is not very clear and we are left without crucial context to understand the proliferation of armed groups outside the control of the state, particularly in Latin America and Africa."
1,dont buy it,"it is too big and hard to hook on the line. after trying to figure out how to hook it to the line i cast it out and it flew off. the thing is giant too as far a bobbers go. you might as well tie a rubber duck to you line, or use this thing as a bath toy."
2,Not worth it,"Opened the package and is nothing like described. Said it came with a frame, DID NOT. Just the mirror. So crazy glue and tape is what's holding it in."
4,cruising gets better with time,interesting film. saw it letterboxed on IFC and it looks even better. PLEASE put it out on DVD with lots of cruising extras.great untidy ending.
3,A Moody Curiosity,"Ultimately, this film generated far more controversy than it deserved. Let's face it, there are a lot of people, gay men included, into the S&M;/leather subculture. In NYC in this era there were clubs like the Mineshaft and the Anvil where all kinds of public and kinky sex were the rule. All the protests really amounted to was a group leather queens and politicos with their panties in a bunch about misrepresentation and stereotypes and homphobia and violence against gay men and .... okay, got the point.Actually, it's a gritty, strange, well-acted mystery. Not a great film, but an intersting slice-of-life, period thriller. Was Friedkin being homophobic? I don't really think so. He just wanted to push some buttons and he did."
4,This review for Adults Only! Subliminal footage of male...,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR ADULTS ONLY! In the rape scene there are two quick subliminal shots after the killer with mirror glasses say ""You made me do that!"". They are of the killer's genital penetrating the victim in an act of rape. You can only see this when you ""pause"" and ""step"" or ""frame by frame"" the scene on your VCR. Definately ""X""-Rated material. In the third killing, in the adult movie room, immediately when you see the knife enter the victim's blue jacket covered back, is another quick subliminal shot of a genital penetrating the victim."
2,Not that controversial,"I think the controversy was alot of hype. I thought so when I saw it back in 1980. Visually its very well done, but unfortunately in makes no sence.However, it has an absolutely killer soundtrack. If you can get your hands on it (and it isn't easy) by all means do. Willie DeVille, the Germs, The Cripples, Muttiny, Rough Trade, Madelyn Von Ritz, John Hyatt (before he got all down-home and nice). Down and dirty gritty punk heaven. Definitely at the top of my list of favorite albums."
3,"Not great, but a great soundtrack","I saw this movie probably a couple of years after it came out, and thought it was pretty good. I also bought the soundtrack for some reason (I unfortunately no longer have it) and I have to say it was better than the movie, and actually made me like the movie more. This obviously is a role Pacino has probably forgotten about, and should."
1,Ambiguously Gay Al,"I was drawn to this film because I was told it wasn't as bad as it's reputation suggests and may have been ahead of it's time. What time? The Stone Age?! Every print of this flick should be burned and banned from human consumption. I've never been accused of being a champion of gay rights but I smell class action suit here. This flick is seamy and has no socially redeeming qualities. William Friedkin's direction is clueless. Al Pacino, in probably his worst performance, seems puzzled as to how to play his character. The script is consistently incoherent. The lone saving grace in this film is Paul Sorvino's portrayal of a police captain. Run from this flick if you ever get the urge."
5,Cruising,"Very interesting and unique film basically about a serial killer who kills gay men. The film takes you into the unseen underground s & m gay men's scene. So this subject is foreign to most movie viewers. I would only recommend it for adults. The soundtrack is my favorite aspect of the film, and you hear an early recording of a little known Los Angeles punk rock group of the time (70's) the germs fronted by lead singer and a personal friend of mine Paul B. (aka Darby Crash). So for me this film not only takes me back but reminds me of the 70's and is a testament to the late Darby Crash (only Paul could overdose and die the same day John Lennon was shot). Long live the 70's punk rock scene. And may Darby rest in peace."
4,When its over you have more questions that when you started.,The movie starts out laying the ground work for a glimpse into the gay leather scene that existed in the 80's and by the end of the movie you are reading between the lines trying to figure out what really happened.If your offended by Gay references and depictions of sex this is not for you. If you like a dark mystery then be prepared to see Pacino in a new light.
2,Al must have been desperate.....,"...to play in this film. Not that his performance was at all bad; it is, in fact, the only thing that saves this movie from getting one star. Aside from ""Revolution"", where Al tries to carry off an English accent with his New York accent (""Dose Britsh...""), this is the worst flick he's been in."
2,Crusing,"I saw the movie ""Crusing"" in the theater back in 1979 and remember the fear it provoked in the gay community.it was so ""now"" and the performances were all top notch,so you can imagine my excitment when i saw that it was now available on DVD. Well that was then this is now,it does not stand the test of time. We were all bored and kept wondering what was it that we liked so much before? Maybe we are all so desencatized now days.so to put it in a nut shell it was really bad and not even bad in a campy way.there are so many movies you can watch over and over again and they hold up well...this is not one of them."
3,Crusing in the 80's,I liked the suspense but I'm not sure of the ending. Left too many questions. I was surprised with the graffic nature for a 80's movie.
2,I cant think of anything good to say about this film.,"This was my first viewing of this film. Maybe I was expecting more, but I felt let down by the whole story line. Al Pacino does infact do very well in his part which seems to pull you into the film. Its a dark and depressing look at the overly stereotyped S&M and cruising scene in the 70's/80's. The shocking or disturbing murder scenes, with the exception of the first, are dull and lackluster. There was nothing disturbing about them. Bigger drawbacks were the overall gay scenes were not convincing enough. So much looked staged and rehearsed, specifically the cruising scenes in the woods or city. It felt like people were trying to hard to act the gay parts. The ending is a let down. The climax of the movie seemed to peter out in a film that should have ended 15 minutes ago. There are some good points to the film itself, but I cannot think of any at this time."
4,Still an important part of gay cinema history,"No matter what you think of the messages in this film, its important to realize it was groundbreaking nontheless. Especially so is what was really going on in the clubs at the time. I can tell you this is how it really was. Exciting and scary at the same time, you can see how a deadly disease could've spread so quickly. Put this in your DVD collection right next to Boys in the Band, Making Love and Priscilla."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Cruising's problem isn't that it's too controversial, or too exploitative, or too dated--its problem is that it's just not a very compelling movie; with a central mystery that isn't interesting and an enigma of a lead character in Pacino's Steve Burns, the movie simply fails to engage the audience."
3,Exceptional Cop Film,"I may be biased towards films by William Friedkin, but I also know a good cop film when I see it. Friedkin doesn't try to answer all the questions about the homosexual lifestyle, but at least he's actually taking on the subject. Most directors don't have the guts to tackle a film like this. I didn't think this film portrayed gays as bad as some people say. People shouldn't look at this as a movie about tearing down homosexuality. This is a cop film about a rookie tracking a killer and questioning himself at the same time. Friedkin provides great direction and the film does draw you in. Pacino and Sorvino are really believable and keep this film looking authentic. Overall, if you like cop films and/or Friedkin, buy this film."
3,Pacino goes underground,"Cop Pacino is sent undercover into NYC's gay leather scene to flush out violent killer of homosexuals. As time passes he gets confused, but it's never really clear as to what he's feeling. In fact, the whole movie is so badly scripted you'll probably get confused more than once. Gays picketed this film upon release, which is very loosely based on a series of gay murders in NYC between 1962-1979. It opens with a disclaimer that this movie is not meant to indict gay life as a whole, but there was controversy nonetheless. Everything you see in this film is real and on location. Intriging, but would have been much better if the direction and the script were tightened up. Director Friedkin has done much better-The Exorcist, French Connection, To Live and Die in L.A., etc. But Pacino, as usual, is appealing to watch, as is Paul Sorvino."
3,Interesting if confused film,"As others have said, this is a love-it or hate-it affair pretty much from ""go."" The plot of the film is confusing, the third act quite ludicrous, and the portrayl of leather gays coming quite close to homophobia. That said, the film is a major Hollywood production dealing with a minority subculture (leather) with a great actor in the lead. The music & sound design are quite good and cinematography is excellent. Seeing the film decades removed from the scandal, what strikes one most about the film is its ambiance, something Friedkin is a master at. An important if over-heated and under-though film."
3,What's all the fuss about?,"This movie is not bad. If you are offended by Will & Grace, or semi-grisly thrillers than it just isn't for you.It IS a pretty good thriller. As far as the gay controversy goes ... admit it guys... been there done that! Remember the Mineshaft and the Piers...or are you trying to forget! No, the whole gay community is not like that, but a enough was. Did you see picketers at Summer of Sam over Plato's Retreat?Anyway ... not a bad thriller.By the way .. sleaziest bits (not for the homophobic or queezy) Do an occassional freeze frame during the controverisial scenes ... Friedkin edited in REAL hard-core gay porn ... how the censors missed this one!"
3,"Brilliant movie, horrible format!","Great movie, great Pacino and a really lurid subject matter rarely looked at. BUT, you must buy the DVD or Blu-Ray copy instead of this VHS."
4,Prepare to be affected!!,"First I want to say that any film that affects you either in a negative or positive manner,is probably a film worth mulling over. As a police film this film is extremely effective in making you feel how deep and how personal an undercover investigation can be. As a representation of a portion of the gay population of that time it is set an a convincing style. An any manner if you are a Pacino film enthusiast, this film is a must. His sullen character is convincing and will definately leave you with a ""what the hell?"""
1,If I could give it zero stars I would!!!,"After reading about all of the controversy surrounding the making of this movie, I finally had to see it. It was absolutely awful. The scenes were choppy and hard to follow. The reasons for all the murders was never officially established. Al Pacino, as our hero, was in no way likeable. All of the scenes in the S&M leather bars seemes unrealistic. These scenes were over the top. It leaves you with the impression that Pacino has taken over the persona of the killer he was trying to capture. This movie was awful. You'll have to excuse me, after watching such garbage, I feel like I need to take a bath."
1,Cruising,"The only reason worth watching is Pacino and Sorvino isn't bad either, the ending I am sure is what gets to most people as I hate open endings.It could have been way better had it not had the gay backstory(no pun intended) especially s&m and freddy mercury look-a-likes. Do I think this is representative of an actual people NO not all,Do I think it is Moral? NO. Of course that is none of my business but as long as you don't parade it around or force others to your culture(Homofascism). It get's 1 star not because I feel that it offends any particular ""Minority"",it only offends you if your are under that group,but because of it's meant to shock imagery and sadistic violence."
1,Awful.,"The overall equation of gay sex with violence made this the first (and for 20 years the only) movie I have ever walked out on. I am not sure what I had been expecting, but violence per se has never been my cup of tea, American Psycho with Christian Bale at least had the right spirit."
1,Simply Bad,"This film has been attacked alot by gays and deservidly so. It does an effective job of making it seem that every gay man in America dresses in black leather and spends all his time in sleezy bars looking for sex. If you can ignore this stereo type, you still have a fairly week film. The script is simply lousy with no real development of plot or character. The dialoge is pretty atrotious too. Finally, the acting leaves alot to be desired.Some people hate this film because of it's stereotypical veiw of gays. I hate it because it is just a bad movie."
1,Blood & Honor/Crazy Horse & Custer two movie combo,"These two movies are by far two of the worst movies that my poor old eyes ever saw!!! If I produced these movies, I would hang my head in shame and change my name! I feel as if I am just not articulate enough to describe my contempt for such poorly made movies and to think, these people actually got paid to act in them. So folks, please stay clear of these two movies...they may be hazardous to your health!!!!!!!"
5,I don't know what the first reviewer is talking about,"He obviously is confusing this CD with something else. It's not German, it's not hip-hop, and except for the occasional hip slurring, you can understand what's sung. This CD is actually a soundtrack to the British film of the same name. It's a little be-bop (be not hip) very jazzy and very eclectic. I love this CD because it's atmospheric and puts me in a very specific mood. I highly recommend the tracks ""Having it All"" and ""So What?""."
1,Secrets of Fat Free Greek Cooking,"The lamb dishes are OK, but most of everything else does not have the authentic Greek flavor. Does not taste very good after having had the real stuff."
3,not useful to my tastes,I find some of the ingredients difficult to find in local stores and I am rather disabled. I cannot even shop much.
1,not worth the paper its written on,"This is a horrible book, who reads this crap. Come on, give me a break. The writing is about the level of a 3rd grader and the story is nothing but one cliche after another for no other reason than writing for the sake of writing. The editors who accepted this manuscript should be fired. What standards do they have, after attempting to read this jumbled, simplistic work the answer is clear: none. I doubt the book would have been published if the author submitted it under her legal name, Delphine Shaw, but change that to redshirt and it is magicaly transformed and yes, unfortunately published. And to think they killed trees to print this..."
2,Focused specifically on call center management,"Goodman's book provides a wealth of information for managing a customer service call center. While some of the content may be transferable to other customer service settings, the majority of the book is directed soley at call center issues, such as telephone skills, call monitoring, etc. I would recommend the book only if you are managing a customer service call center."
5,Good price reasonable deliver,the price of these two batteries was good and the delivery was in a reasonable time.
4,Good Battery,I purchased my DeWalt cordless drill some years ago with 2 batteries. I had one go out and purchased a cheap refirb. The old saying you get what you pay for held true - I think it lasted about 18 mths. I pick this one up and it seems solid. Hopefully with the brand name - it will last as well as the originals.
4,good deal,"Hi, I recently purchased the 14.4 Dewalt battery because i needed one, really two, but the two pack deal was gone, dog gone it. Anyway, the battery works great and saved me 25 bucks too. The free delivery clinched the deal. Happy with my purchase."
5,dc9091 review,"very happy with this item. had previously purchased a ps140 battery by b&d and it was not anywhere as good. the 9091 lasted much longer while working. Although it cost more,i feel it was much more cost effective. Would purchase same unit again. hnl"
1,Great battery while it lasted...,On my second recharge it fried and very nearly caught fire. Because it was beyond returning to Amazon. I sent it to a repair depot in Maryland. I have yet to receive it back. Very disappointed in DeWalt's web site and access to real information.
1,unbelievable,"bought this battery in Jan 2011. used it minimally. completely died last week. wont even take a charge. no life at all. so had the battery for 16 months total, 4 months after manufacturer warranty expired. emailed them explaining that is must be a flook, that theres no way they sell crap batteries such as this and they said sorry a years up.heres the emailMe:bought battery last year and it just quite on me this week...after minimal use. I realize theres probably only a one year manufacturers warranty on it but these batteries last alot longer than a little over a year. was wondering if i could return battery for a new one as i suspect this particular one that i received was a defective one and a flook and doesnt represent all the batteries you carry. please let me know what steps to take to get this battery replaced.thank you.The Battery Geeks response:I am sorry for the inconvenience of the battery. We do only warranty the battery for 1 year free replacement.Thank you!TBG"
3,Not bad,"Bought this because I have three Dewalt cordless drills and decided it was more prudent to get a new battery than buy another drill package. It appears to be authentic, but I was underwhelmed with the lasting power after the first charge... Perhaps it will improve with subsequent uses."
5,Dewalt 14.4 Replacement batteries,"These batteries work as good as the original ones. I found this to be the only practical way to replace my batteries. If you purchase new Dewalt batteries at a store, you will pay twice the price or more. For what they want in the stores, you might as well throw your drill away and buy a new one."
3,Don't pay for fast shipping,"I looked at E-bay and could have purchased their, but thought I would get faster delivery from Amazon.com. I even paid for two day delivery, bad choice as it took over a week to receive my 14.4 V Dewalt battery packs. The new battery packs work, but are very hard to get off my drill, hope this gets better with time.Next time I go to E-bay to purchase.Learned a lesson in life,Ron G"
5,new customer review,"As a new customer buying three itmes at seperate times I found that Amazon was a very good comany to deal with as I saved money on all three items. Delivery was very fast. I would recommend your company to all. regards, Jim Fitzpatrick"
3,DEWALT DC9091 14.4-VOLT XRP BATTERY PACK,This battery is acceptable as a replacement. However one flaw is that the battery is not the same size as the original. It fits the drill fine but does not fit into the carrying case properly. It is a small flaw but other than that it works fine.
4,The Joys of Battery Relationships,"Ok Everyone,Like many of you I own Dewalt AND Black & Decker tools, These batteries work very well , I bought 2 to replace my older ones..They came blister packed , fast shipped, & New.. They work like a charm..MY Only Complaint is they are Outrageously PRICED !!!!!!But if you want a quality battery, This is what you want...THE PRICE is WHY I don't Give it 5 Stars !!!!!!!!!!!!!Enjoy, Buy one today, you'll be please what Long Lasting power it brings to your tools !!!"
3,Side catches don't lock battery into tools so well,"I just purchased a couple of these batteries and they work fine, once you manage to seat them, but the problem is that they don't seat very easily. Unlike my other Dewalt batteries, which snap right into place, the catches on the sides of these batteries don't pop into place. I don't know if Dewalt has switched to a softer plastic that lacks tension or if their molds are poorly shaped, but the only way you can get the battery to snap into place is to really whack it from the bottom with your palm a couple of times while firmly holding the tool in your other hand. Otherwise the battery will fall out of the tool as soon as you lift up the tool."
5,Better than New. Don't throw the ole Dewalt 14.4v drill away yet...,"The XRP batteries are a little bigger than the original 14.4v XR type,that came with the drill, but snap right in. A previous review was correct,in that they don't fit in the carrying case. I took a dremel tool and shaved off the battery holding ridges (a little)on both sides of the case to make them fit like a glove. The new batteries came in less than three days. With these new XPR batteries the old 14.4v Dewalt Drill is better than new. Amazon and MYTOOLPLACE.COM --> ROCKS."
4,excellent replacement,I have had my original cordless Dewalts for 12 years and this is the first time I have needed to replace batteries. The new ones seem to function just as well - here's to another 12 years out of them!
4,extra battery,I needed an extra battery for my 2 dewalt 14.4v impack drills. This was the best price I found on an original repacement.
2,Short Life,"I don't know why, but my XRP batteries went dead after 5 years. 6 other DeWalt batteries are still going strong after 8 and 10 years."
4,New Battery for old Drill,"Nice to be able to find the older 14.4V battery at a price that doesn't make me just want to buy a new drill and save money. Looks the same, fits the same, works better than the old one. No problems charging it up or using it in the drill."
1,not hold a charge,"This battery is not holding a charge, Don't know if it was damaged in shipping. The air bubble wrap was deflated in box, so there was no protection of item.Or maybe battery is just defected. Will have to contact Amazon to see what they will do. Not Happy with this item"
3,disappointing,"Good price . Dewalt batteries suck compared to other brands. They work fine when new, but go downhill quickly. I have 3 of the 14.4 drills, and a small circular saw. The saw just sucks the juice out of these batteries in a few minutes. The actual battery life , before being replaced is disappointing. I use them as a back up drill, one drill for driving and one for drilling so I don't have to keep going back and forth changing bits."
3,Dewalt $$$$,"This is a good battery but it cost too much in my opinion. Better value in other drill motor batteries. Got the drill, what you going to do..."
5,DEWALT 14.4 volt Battery Pack,"The exact replacement as described. As is typical with most all Amazon orders, it arrived quickly within a few days. The new battery is working fine."
5,You get what you pay for!,"My 14.4v DC728 DeWalt drill (3 years old) has outlasted 2 other ones, Royobi and Hitachi, still going strong and with the power needed far exceeding the competitors. I have just ordered another drill and battery for my back up. DeWalt may cost a bit more, but as the old saying goes, "" you get what you pay for""!"
1,Bad dangerous product (Good Amazon Service),"I purchased this product April 2011 and charged right after received. It was seemingly a great product for the rare occasion I used, it held a charge until today. I put in charger unit and after about one hour our family detected this bad smell in the house. I started to look around and upon entering the back room where unit was charging. the battery was gurgling and bubbling and smelling and smoking as well as partially melted. I am sure thankful we were home to catch this problem or the outcome may have been much different.I am hoping the seller will refund or replace this product.BrianUpdate: Amazon swiftly answered my email with a complete refund..Gotta love AMAZON!"
4,Dewalt 14.4 V battery pack,"Although it doesn't last forever, DeWalt makes an awesome battery pack, able to drive through dense materials with high torque. Unfortunately, DeWalt also wants a high price for it. Here I got the exact same product at about 1/2 DeWalt's price -- and that pleases me greatly!"
4,Dewalt 14.4 volt,"It's so nice to get the real thing again. I have purchased aftermarket batteries, but they don't hold a charge like the XR does.The new battery from DeWalt fits perfectly in the charger and all my DeWalt tools. It does not fit in the case for the Drill like the original did. The exterior housing is just a little bit bigger around and the case will not close. I did not try it in any of the other cases since the drill is with me at all times. I have to carry the battery outside the case and put it in the drill when I am ready to use it.I charged it last week, used it then and used it again today and have had no problems with the charge.I would (and will) buy another."
4,Does what it is intended to do,"This battery is an improvement over the originals, not doubt. However, my last replacement battery was a no-name brand that, in spite of being 8 months older, holds a charge longer than this battery. And it was cheaper. Unfortunately, I didn't keep record of it's source!"
4,Triratchet,This tool I only use it when I work in awkard places I wish there is a triratchet in 1/2 it woul be very helpfull .
2,Dangerous Junk,Clunky and doesn't execute very well. Dangerous. Forget drilling with this. You need included bits and one broke in 10 seconds into soft wood - too much wobble in system. I'd give it no stars if they let me change it.
1,Total life one minute,"Out of the box, it worked on one bolt, then the selector handle got all jammed up and the ratchet would not work at all."
2,Not quite the chomper I'd hoped for.,"I saw the Black and Decker Alligator on the Today Show. It sliced through thick branches and was easy to use. I ordered it and looked forward to swishing through my hedges with a nifty lopper/chain saw. It was not to be.First off, The Alligator was heavier than I thought it would be, or felt heavier. Then, it jammed up with alarming frequency as I worked on my hedges. I know this isn't a hedge trimmer, but didn't perform the way I'd hoped or for what I wanted. Sad to say, it went back last week and I finished trimming my hedges with my hand driven old-fashioned lopper. It did a great job, but took a little extra time. Back to the drawing board for me. This machine might work better for someone with different needs, but for me, it was not what the woodsman ordered."
4,short but sweet,"It assembled easily. It appears, and is a little short. i am 5' 10"" but it is nearly a good fit, and it's nothing very noticeable in fact. Just adjust your chair. It looks pretty sleek, and is compact enough for my tiny apartment. I would recommend it."
4,decent sub sound,"I added this to a kit in a small room. I didn't think that with the size it was going to be a really intense sub so, I'm plenty satisfied with how it sounds and the level of sound it puts out. I changed out some of the screws, installed it with a friend and together we made it work well with the old cut out we had. The hole was too big so, we made some adjustments, and it all went pretty smooth. Over all, I think I knew exactly what I was getting so, with paying this little, I wasn't expecting some $200 sub to arrive at my door. Its a good sub for me."
1,This is not a book to be set aside lightly.,"Instead, it should be flung to the ground with great force. Acker is nothing more than a paedophile, a dirty old toothless man trapped in a woman's body. Comprehensively awful. Had a man written this, he would have been lynched instantly. Avoid at all costs."
2,In two minds...,"I tried really hard to like this book but to be honest I found its lack of a plot frustrating and it made the book really unenjoyable. I like Kathy Acker's style of writing, which is very stark and honest, and the idea of smattering the novel with poems and maps and drawings quite original, but neither worked for me. I felt the book was being confronting (lots of pictures of/references to genitals) for the sake of it and I struggled to finish it; by the time I had I was really sorry I'd bothered. I wouldn't reccommend this book for anyone who, like me, prefers the traditional narrative form of writing, nor anyone who is easily offended. I can see that this book might have had a point, but i obviously didn't get it."
1,WARNING - DO NOT BUY A USED GAME,"Warning, if you buy a used copy of the game and it has been registered, you will not be able to play multiplayer.Only buy a used copy of the game if you want to play with yourself.I bought one copy at full price. I bought a second copy used to put on a second computer to play against my nephew. I called Electronic Arts and they said they could do nothing. I need to buy a new game, unless I pay them $10.00 for a new key so I can use my second copy, which I already paid for."
2,woah i was really dissapointed,"ok i was so dam excited about buying BFME because it had the C&C; engine and all magazines were saying about these massive battles and heroic victories......but where are they ? in skirmish mode only 200 command points.I hope its not like C&C; where u have to play 4000 times to be able to unlock more stuff . Slow action the graphics were a little dissapointing as well i have a ati radeon x800,audigy platnium 2zx and 2 gbs of ram .The action is like someone else said ""underwater action""The only other thing i have to say is the presets for your buildings is very chessy you only have like 10 presets and thats in a castle map in camps and outposts u have like 3 whats up with that.How is that suppose to be like the movie with a little base.to end this review OVER THIS GAME IS DOUBE HANDS DOWN.....BAD DONT BUY THIS UNTILL YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH AND FIND OUT ABOUT THE BULLCRAP THEY SAID ABOUT THIS GAME........THE END"
3,Beautiful but Stupid,"The game looks great, however the single player campaigns quickly grow tiresome. Online play suffers from EA's peer to peer model, players often disconnect to avoid a loss online resulting in a frustrating waste of a half hour of your life. If you don't have it already buy Warcraft 3 instead.After playing the game some more I came back to edit my review. Here is my final opinion. Do Not Buy IT. Read the unfavorable reviews in this forum to get an idea of the problems with this game. I myself do not care to invest any more time into this worthless pursuit."
2,"""DO YOU EXCEPT CASH? (KACHING!)""","I bought this game last year when it still cost $50. It was fun at first but not totally worth it. It didn't take much strategy to win, just superior numbers. But it was at least fun to make giant trolls and have hordes of warg riders. If you're looking for a good stratedgy game get ""Rise of Nations"""
3,Not sophisticated but fun,"That pretty much says it all. The graphics are nice and the two good and evil campaigns were fun. The game is a little simplistic, however. The on-line feature doesn't interest me so, once you play through each campaign, you're done. No real long-term playability. For the price though, it was a good buy.Recommended."
4,LOTR pretty good indeed,LOTRRead other reviews for detail. My thoughts:- Fighting gets redundent after a while but the key battle are fun and true to the movie.- Leveling up adds a layer of attention that makes the game more interesting- Good sound and musicNice game that I am still playing.
5,My fav LOTR game ever.,I've played every LOTR game out there and EA really blew me away with this games. The graphics are great as well as gameplay. The combat and story mode are really awsome. I reall see nothing wrong with it.
5,Battle for Middle Earth,"Battle for Middle is a definite must-get for all Lord of the Rings fans.I think best part of this game are the missions. I still haven't finished them all- I'm still working on the Black Gate- but I can definitly say that is one of the neatest RTS games I've played. Some of the missions are easy but there are a couple real hard ones to get through, especially Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith (those elephants are really difficult to kill. The first time I tried it, they wiped out my entire Rohirrim army)."
1,Helloooo Amazon...this game DOES NOT work on Windows 98!,We read the description...read the reviews...made certain that we were using the correct platform....and...WON'T work on Windows 98! The description says that it does. WRONG!! I'm hoping to get my money back and am very disappointed. Please correct this before someone else has this happen to them.
2,Not what I expected...read why.,"I was expecting a solid real time startegy game like Rome Total War or even the dated Praetorians but was very dissapointed to find out that The Battle for Middle Earth (TBFME) is a lot like the Warcraft series, basically a mouse click-fest where the only elements that matter in the low sacle fights are how many units you created and how fast you can click the mouse or shortcuts during battle. Terrain, unit positions within each other, prescence of commanders, flank or rear attacks, surprise, morale, or anything else from more realistic battles have no effect.For these reasons, the game (TBFME), ends up being a flashy patchwork of sounclips and cinematics from Peter Jackson's superb movies and nothing more than a failed attempt at recreating the epic battles from Tolkien's masterpiece novels."
4,"Good game, no freedom","I thought it was a fun game, though I was expecting a non-Warcraft format. I like the freedom of being able to build where I want. I guess it adds an extra aspect of play. Also, I was not impressed with the difficult setting. My first time playing I beat two hard computer players."
3,All chrome and no substance,"This game sports impressive visuals and captures the feels of the movie perfectly, but, as a game, it is a total failure. The gameplay is repetitive and boring. The only challenge comes from dealing with the AI of your own units, which has a tendency of refusing to follow your orders. This will keep you busy re-issuing those orders, but it is not what I have in mind as fun."
3,EA games are useless at customer support and patching bugs,"Just a warning to potential buyers of lord of the rings that EA games have a shocking record with customer service and are very poor about patching bugs in their games. For example, EA's 'award winning' RTS game, ""Command & Conquer Generals, Zero Hour"" is riddled with bugs that more unscrupulous gamers exploit. EA has known about these for over a year now and yet has failed to patch these bugs. EA also closed down the European servers for the game increasing most Europeans' pings by ~80-120ms.Hope they get it right this time. My impression is that after you have bought the game from EA, you are on your own - little support, minimal patching, but btw thanks for your $50...."
2,IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This could be a great game if you could play it. By this I mean you better have one hell of a computer to run the darn thing. I have a 2003 DELL with Pentium 4 and it all most had a stroke try to run it. Your computer needs a Pentum 5, but of corse they don't make them yet. So, for now you'll need a computer from NORAD. This is the only way to play it. In 2 years you'll be able to play it on all the very high graphics. Trust me, every body else is playing it on low graphis. It acts like its haveing a mussel spasm. Just wait a yeat or sow to by."
2,Blah,"I was expecting something a bit more epic from the likes of Lord of the Rings but it's a bit boring and slow going. I'll stick with the World of Warcraft, the game ""The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-Earth"" should be. =P"
1,Buyer Beware,"If you don't have a really really good computer don't even try to play this. I have 2.2 GHZ, 768 MB RAM, 128 MB Graphics card, windows XP, The latest Direct X, and an 40 GB of availble space on the hard drive, and even at the lowest graphic setting you can run this game at it runs really slow. I'm not sure how good of a computer you need to have to play this game smoothly, but it's definatly not the MIN requirment that EA put on the box. Maybe I should just fork over the $1.5K+ for an Alienware because I don't think anything else will run this game."
4,Be a Middle-earth general,"A lot of work obviously went into this, this is especially evident in the campaign taking the Fellowship through all the stages of the book. My one complaint is the mini-map (a Palantir, of course!) which shows everything indistinctly, or at times, no troops appear at all. Not a good situation to lose track of troops, or worse yet, of heros. The heros are an important part, as are the upgrades, and it's such fun to do a lightening sword shot with Gandalf. Well worth the $10 it cost..."
4,Great! but....,"I saw all the previews. it showed thousands of units fighting on screen. i thought that u would be able to do this in the game. i was shocked to find out that u could barely reach over a hundred using the ""good"" forces. even the return of the king DVD show-cased these enormous fights. However this game was fun despite this. The graphics are great! I personally suggest to get War hammer dawn of war over this one"
1,bad,the game its self is an amazing game but i bought the disc from amazon and its a pirated disc i have all these problems with my buildings blowing up and such
3,Good RTS,"Overall, this is a decent RTS. The battles can be small skirmishes or epic scenes. I especially like the cavalry's ability to charge through enemies and trample foot soldiers. While playing through the story line I noticed that if it feels like you are losing, just keep with it and you might just pull out a victory.The fans of the original story will enjoy fighting some of those battles that are only mentioned throughout the books. Hero's are also a big part of the game. Gandalf is one of my favorites. Also, the elves can kick butt as well.So, RTS fans...I recommend this game and I plan on picking up the second one unless anyone can tell me otherwise.Semper Fi"
5,It rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,GET IT OR YOU WILL MISS OUT ON ALL THE DESTRUCTION AND INCREDIBLE GRAPHICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Get Rome Total War Instead,Hello I am not a complete flammer so I was kind and gave the fun rating of this game a 4 becuase it does have some fun aspects. But do yourselfs a favor and buy rome total war instead.RTW vs TBFMERTWHuge unit scale! Control up too 10 thousands HIGHLY detailed units at a time!Realistic units and historical detail!Impressive graphics NOT low polyImpressive sound every battle begins with a speech from your general and the taunts of his men!Very fun and in-depth single player the game has sooo much to offer after you beat the game as 1 faction you can play as the others untill you beat them all and they are all unlocked!Takes strategyTBFMESmall unit scall only between 200-300Graphics equal to RTW not better!Seems like it stole all its ideas from the Total War franchiseWill only hold value to LOTR fansOverall buy RTW I cant even explain how great it is! If you like to pretend you are a hero from LOTR........ then go ahead and buy this.
1,A sad sad excuse for an rts,Oh my what a dissapointment for one thing the max pop is 200 with 2 people playing and and with people playing its 150 i spent the whole game trying to save up for enough reasources trying to make a good army but i cant really breach the enemys castle with 150 guys the game lags in campaign and the charcters in the game dont even sound like they do in the movie why dont all u RTS fanns go to the mall walk past BFME and pick up Empire Earth2 now thats a real RTS and thats max pop is 2000 and its got better graphics
5,To Mordor,"When I got this game for Christmas, I thought Dawn of War would be better. When I played Battle for Middle-Earth, I stopped playing Dawn of War. Once I found out about how to play, I liked it a lot!I am very good at playing the Battle for Middle Earth. I like that you can summon Balrog by getting twenty experience and other experience to get upgrades. Now, maybe I can play one of you on multiple player!!!By Kristian Stewart, age 9"
1,"Distorted, poor scholarship","This author has pretensions to scholarship in his use of other scholars' work, which is summarized according to his own understanding and often footnoted. As one other reviewer pointed out, parts of the book are written in the style of fiction, presumably to make one feel like one was there. The tone of writing is flippant and condescending. The auther follows the lead of Goodrick-Clarke in blaming the phenomenon of Nazism on esotericism, rather than recognizing or admitting the truth that, as was their usual procedure, the Nazis simply distorted and appropriated those occult theories that were useful to their agenda in their distorted form. Many unfair accusations against Blavatsky are repeated in his book from other sources with little or no real evidence, sometimes not even a reference."
4,Not very well written but still intriguing,"Reading this, it is fairly obvious that this is Mr. Hale's first book, but the subject is so interesting and has received so little attention that it is still a good read"
4,Himmlers Crusade,"This was ok I guess. It contained material that I had already discovered in other books, but it was superbly written."
2,book review,backgrounder for some of the Indiana Jones plots.some good information interspersed with extraneoussections. Too long.
2,A good book if your electricity is off,"Gripping this book is most definitely not, neither is particularly exciting or chilling or compelling. It is however, very well researched and detailed, and reads much like a very dull travelogue. The narrative is primarily step by step accounts of which cable was sent to who, which native the team offended on what day, etc... but it leaves out a great deal of backstory about the Nazi occult fetish, which would have made this book a great deal more interesting."
2,wish it fit,it doesnt say that the mounting is only at bottom there is no way to attach it to the truck on the body i used L brackets and double sided tape to hold them on. the holes in bottom work but when you go down the road air makes them rattle.draw a line around flares after install then remove them get some self taping screws with rubber washers the put L brackest in three spots on each fender set up your flares then 1 screw in bottom push flares aganst body screw in flares to L brackets then screw in rest at bottom.
2,DISAPPOINTING!!,"I was expecting so much, and received so little! Don't be fooled by the beautiful cover! All the pictures seemed similar in washed out colors and shape, as if the photographer never left one area of Tuscany. He captured very few of it's many facets. Out of the 79 photographs, there was only about 15 that did anything for me. And there was not ONE photograph of the fields of sunflowers that Tuscany is famous for. Only a picture of dead ones in winter!Tuscany is breathtakingly gorgeous, and vast, with so much character! Very little of that is captured in this book. It didn't do Tuscany the justice it deserves!"
1,Tuscany:Inside the Light by Joel Meyerowitz,"I ordered this book, expecting something entirely different. I am extremely disappointed and I am sorry I spent the money for it. I expected to see more street scenes and tips to help you paint the ""old Tuscany"" style. There are only landscape scenes, and nothing like I would like to paint! Nothing there looks like what I think Tuscany style is!"
4,"Reliable, Dependable, Essential","A must have for any workshop. The portability of a cordless with the power of a hammer drill. It has the power to tackle MOST jobs - however extremely hard concrete will wear down batteries quickly.It also has a good bit of weight to it, but it is balanced well."
3,"Average build up, but good starter wind up zoid.","Good zoid to build up for anyone just starting. Aside from the instructions being in japanese it is a straight forward build with really no difficulty. Rubber hosings sometimes come out, but nothing a little dab of glue can't fix. Good bang for the buck zoid."
1,the passion of Rumi,I recieved the CD box without the CD itself and the merchant just returned it and did not send me another one!! so I never got to enjoy it. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED by the service
5,Excellent guide to accessibility interiors,The book is an excellent guide to accessibility interiors for all people. The book show different kind of accessories and you can choose. They are really beautiful. She explains in simple words the utility of each one. In many case you can see the accessories in use.
4,It's so usful and can be an practical guideline.,"This book can be used as an practical guideline for barrier-free environment (the proper figures, proper pictures and useful comments about the pictures...etc.) And also, it propose that barrier-free space should be ""beautiful"". This point made us think not only funtion but also asthetics of the barrier-free spaces. I really appreciated this point of view."
4,Great product with one design flaw,"I have a family room where no wall was suitable for mounting a TV and this was a great solution.It was easy to assemble and looks classy and elegant.However, I do not understand why the vertical post does not have holes in the front for the cables to come out and plug into the various components and TV. It has a channel in the back of the post for cable management but no holes in the front for access to the devices - completely inexplicable.The packaging was torn and battered when it arrived; some of the pieces were protuding out. I was expecting dings and scratches on some of the metal parts but luckily - those had been wrapped and that saved them."
5,Excellent Product,The speakers replaced two very expensive Sony speakers. I was very disappointed in the Sony speakers. Within two months of installing them on my boat they began to leak rust and after one and a half years they fell apart and stopped working. These Pioneer speakers have a great sound and appear to be built and have a sound much superior to the Sony's
5,"Good, medium price speakers","I bought these for my boat used mostly by my 20 something son who insisted we replaced the old speakers he blew up playing them too loudly. So far, these have lasted better and I'll bet they've been tested greatly!"
1,Changed size makes this speaker useless.,"The speaker this one replaced, the PIONEER TS-MR165 has a completely different diameter. This is a boat speaker and pioneer might have thought about keeping the dimensions the same. Generaly when you replace something like a speaker, you'd expect it to fit exactly, but the idiots at the new CHINESE plant didnt figure that out. The amazon store where these were purchased shipped them out quickly and I have no complaints against them whatsoever."
1,KRAHE=KRAP,"WHILE IT LOOKS GOOD ON THE SCREEN, THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE APPEARED AMATEURISH AND HAD NO DEPTH OR DIMENSION...GOT BETTER POSTERS IN THE 60'S"
5,It worked!,"Get Hired! helped me enter into an industry that I had not been in before. I have been in sales forever and decided to take three years off. When I decided it was time to enter into the sales industry once again, I found the ideal job for me in a market that I did not have any experience in. With the guide of this book, it landed me an interview as well as my new career!"
5,This book defines the new cutting edge of how to get hired.,"This book really cuts through the traditional and tired methods and gave me fresh ideas that are rock solid. If you want to stand out in the crowd, this is a must-read book! I landed my current brand management position using techniques straight from the pages of Get Hired! Use these techniques and you will be successful in your search."
4,like it,This item is really good for a costume party or any party and easy fitWe'll recommend to have it in a car for any emergencyThank you!Kiddy Hamman
5,Luxuria rocks!,"This album is a little over produced (bordering on Disney-core here and there) but is otherwise exceptional. Two or three of the songs are on the slow and not very interesting side, but the rest is great. If you like bands like Puffy Amiyumi, or late (post-ska) No Doubt!, then you'll probably enjoy this too. Check them out on myspace or youtube to get a good sample (search for bandaluxuria)."
4,A good intro to environmentalism,"Radical Ecology is an overview of the environmental movement and the social and economic forces that gave rise to it. The book is divided into three parts. The first deals with the nature of the global ecological crisis. In the second part, the author focuses on three schools of thought in the environmental movement: Deep Ecology, Spiritual Ecology, and Social Ecology. Lastly is discussed the movements that have grown out of these schools of thought, namely, Green politics, Ecofeminism and Sustainable Development.While Radical Ecology is not lacking in information and insight, it really is little more than an overview and therefore does not discuss in depth any of the issues covered. It is therefore a work best suited for those who simply want an introduction to environmentalism."
3,Peterbilt Buckle,"It has good quality, but it's not really big enough for a man. Looks better on a woman or child."
5,belt buckle,The buckle was shipped on time and it was not damaged when it arrived. The size was smaller than expected but looked good.
3,intriguing and limited,"Wright is a poet brave enough to trust and follow the meanderings of her mind and the results are often amazing for several lines at a time, but rarely for a whole poem. She has a great eye and pulls of some stunning visual description, but to put it politely, there isn't much of an intellect backing up these special effects and too many of the poems come out mushy and sentimental. The work is lazy, but she does have a wry off-handed sense of humor that often rescues the work from banality."
1,Poet Laureate of Laziness,"Wright's aesthetic is one of self-congratulatory linguistic and philosophical laziness. Most of her poems look like they were tossed off in five minutes and never revised, which is why her work is a favorite of the ""post-post"" club. Except for a handful of good prose poems and certain parts of Deepstep Come Shining (Wright's only even halfway good book, of which too little is included in this collected), these poems are downright pointless and boring."
4,Nintendo 64 AC Power Adapter,I needed this to complete my system. Of course I liked it! :) perfect condition for an adapter. Like I said I needed this to complete my system.
2,Cheap Electronics,Sort of works but I wasn't comfortable with it. It didn't fit into the back of the system without using a lot of force. Once it was in it made a constant buzzing sound. I ended up buying a used first party Nintendo one to replace this one. The first party one is silent and fits well.
5,Good,I recieved the package quickly and there were no faults or problems I had with the it. It's some pretty good stuff for a classic old game.
5,VERY IMPRESSED,I am extremely satisfied with the response time! The item I bought came even sooner than I expected! I strongly recommend that people buy from this seller!
1,broke,i bought and barely used it. i had to put my nintendo 64 aways and when i got it back it was broken. very disappointing
3,What happened to you Tiesto?,"This is not what I was expecting at all. I should have know better after listening to ISOS 5. It wasn't the worst trance that I've heard but way too heavy on the vocals. It's okay for a DJ to have a vocal heavy mix, take Markus Schulz's ""Without You Near"" but there's a point when enough is enough, i.e. when subpar melody is fused with lackluster vocals. It reminded me of his Summerbreeze fiasco. I know I'm being a little harsh (I just expected more from the #1 DJ) there were definitely a few decent tunes but only buy if you're a huge Tiesto fan, and buy it used, otherwise pass and hope he can put out something better in the future."
3,"Decent, at best.","Far from Tiesto's best work. After listening to Tiesto's ""Parade of Atheletes"", I was sure this would be a great album as well. Not the case. A select few good tracks, but really not worth the money."
5,Another Great Creation from Tiesto,"I am Tiesto fan and dying to be able to see him live in concert. I own a lot of Tiesto music, ISOS series, Magik, Just Be, Parade of Athletes, and his DVDs. I was so happy when I saw Elements of life CD at the music store where I live..cos it is quite difficult to get Tiesto CDs where I live. I got most of my Tiesto's online or from friends who went to Europe.What can I say about this CD...it grows on you. It's not like In Search of Sunrise PANAMA or Live in Amsterdam (which are still in my CD changer in my car for the last 3 years)I like all the songs in the Album, but the one that stuck in my head is Break My Fall...have to fight the urge to dance whenever I listened to it. (since i listen to it everywhere, office, driving, ipod...) I really like the intro...kinda tease you to get to the song..then BT's voice came....sooooo nice.I still love Tiesto..his music is Magic. I always happy when I listen to his music...drug free...nice eh??Keep dancing everyone!!!"
4,Music to Write Code By,"Another good addition to a long playlist of trance electronica I listen to while writing code. Thanks, D.J. Tiesto!"
2,Subpar,"Avid collector of Tiesto's music, but this cd is one of the worst i have heard from him by far. Considerable drop from previous work. Do not purchase, get anything else from tiesto, spend your money on An In Search of Sunrise album. I have them all and love them dearly"
2,Dissapointing coming from Tiesto.,"I expected better of Tiesto, but his decline continues with Elements of Life. Some of the tracks (like Sweet Things) were just bad. Terrible vocals, poor sounding in general. Let PVD and AVB take over; they deserve to. They continue to produce quality stuff. Tiesto has just finally began to choke on his ego, and it will be the eventual complete demise of him. Tiesto is more concerned about spreading his name, and doesn't spend enough time in the studio. He has basically forgotten about the music that has famed him. AVB does a weekly radio show and keeps on top of everything Trance. Tiesto keeps on top of himself, and nothing more."
1,Where is Tiesto??,"Something must have happened with Tiesto, because this is by far his worst CD. I couldn't find a song with sense.... I can't wait for ""In Search of Sunrise: Ibiza"" to see if he makes it up!!!"
2,old tiesto,I am kinda disappointed in this cd I like the old tiesto way better than this stuff. Hopefully his next cd rocks.
2,Really?! Seemed Like Elements of Boredom!,"Elements of Life didn't really impress me, at all. It seemed to be the same old thing with Dance and Electronica, regardless of the artists (most of them, at least) that create these songs. ""Dance4Life"" was just someone reading this phrase ""Dance for life"" in a monotone voice - which I personally found to be boring at the least, and irritating as fingernails on a chalkboard at the most. The drum and bass might have been an interesting tempo, but the notes - an average of only 5 or 6 played until the melodic pattern repeats itself - were boring. Maybe I'm wrong, but the 29-second snippet of music that I am allowed to hear didn't help to influence me anymore into a more positive and encouraging review for this album. I really wished that a lot of these artists could come up with an actual song with a nice melodic line instead of the same 5 or 6 notes played for the 3-8 minutes of play on a track."
5,Excellent!,"Just like in any CD there is a couple of not so good songs, but most of the tracks are Tiesto reinventing and pushing limits.Go for it. Will be a collector's item!"
3,Pretty Good,"Tiesto is a good producer but a better DJ. The tracks on here are pretty decent but the only one I REALLY liked a lot was ""Break My Fall"" and ""In The Dark"" was pretty good too."
3,O.K. but not great,"I've never really been one to ""collect every single piece of work that Tiesto comes out with. I enjoy some of his productions but some of them I'm left thinking, ""What happened?"" I was kind of dissapointed with some of this album and happy with others. But really, your best bet would be to get the remixed edition of this. Some of the tracks I didn't like on this turn out really well on the remixed."
1,Getting tired of the bad,"Only one good song on this for me. This music was mostly a lot of repetitive noise and simple thumping.Seems he's getting tired or lazy. Maybe it's like the old actors who make a movie because it's easy money and don't care if it gets any acclaim. Seems he will do a good CD (4 or 5 good songs), then a bad, then a good.Lesson: read the reviews on Amazon"
1,Disappointing,"I was shocked when I heard elements of life. This is not the music Tiesto used to create joy for his fans with. This completely disappointed many of his fans, and I am definetely one of them. I am afraid Tiesto might be losing it."
3,Different.,"I bought this CD as it contained the only recording of one of my set works for TEE Music (Echoes From An Antique Land, Jennifer Fowler.) However, there are many other great tracks on Mizu To Kori, so long as you're in the frame of mind to deal with music a little out of the ordinary - the tracks are all solely percussion-based. Some of the pieces - such as Fowler's Echoes - drag a little, but at the same time they are admirable for being extremely complex works for difficult pieces. The standout work is by far ""An Inkling For an Anklon"", which contains traces of Indonesian music. However, this CD is definitely not for everyone, as after a while every work starts to sound the same. If you're a fan of classical music, it's safer to stick to Bach or Mozart."
1,Disappointed,"The retractable function did not work even once out of the box. There are cheaper and better key chains out there. Shady, shady, shady."
1,DuraPro retractable Key chain,"The retractable lanyard requires little effort to stop retracting. I brought 5 (one for each member in my family), and with-in two weeks, all were unable to retract. I first thought it was the kids being tough on the item, but I was very carefully with mine and it also stopped working. My suggestion is to make the retracting unit more durable."
1,Does not retract,"We used this key chain less than a week, and the retractable function failed.This key chain is a rip off.Trying to return it is even more frustrating, so I would recommend just boycotting this product, and it's supplier. Shipping costs about the same as the full retail? Save yourself time and money. Do not buy this item, or anything from it's supplier."
1,DOA,Failed to retract the first time I used it. I took it apart in an attempt to fix it and discovered the plastic reel is very quick to crack under the pressure of the spring. It's only good point is the exceptionally bright LED. Don't waste your time.
4,BRIGHT!!!!,Nice little key chain when there is no light. The LED is BRIGHT!!! and the length of the string is long enough for me to extend my arm while holding it in place.
4,Good for personal use,"OK, I have owned this model of printer for about five years now. I got tired of the slow, messy, cheesy, ink jet printers and decided to go for a quality color laser printer. As an IT Professional and someone who supported business class laser printer, I knew that HP provides quality. In my opinion, this printer makes a great personal printer and could be used in a small office. The HP 2500 color laser cannot keep up with the demand of a high volume office. For my purposes, occasional documents and quarterly reports, this printer meets my needs. The time to print from cold start is a long one but this is a case for all color laser printers of this vintage. Yes, it make a lot of noise on start up. It is testing all the components. As for print speed, it is faster than in ink jet and for personal use, I think that most people would be fine with the speed. I did, however, opt for the extra paper tray. This makes life a lot easier."
4,Cushy part of strap is too short?,"I agree with other reviewers that the cushy part of the strap is too short. I have another (older) Op/Tech strap that is identical to this one except the cushy part is longer. I like the longer one better. That said, I used this new strap for the first time this weekend to photograph a wedding (actually, I had both straps around my neck all day supporting two cameras) and there was no difference in the feel or functionality of the straps, so I've decided that strap length is just a visual preference for me. That's why I'm giving it four stars, though it probably deserves five."
5,My favorite strap so far,"Very comfortable, with a neck pad that's wide, but not too wide. The finished edges of the neck pad are much more comfortable than the sharp/rubbery edges of the average neoprene pad.I really like the way you can remove the neck pad and snap the ends together to make a handstrap. I use that feature often - when I put the camera on a tripod, or when I'm using a long lens that has its own strap.The price is excellent - less than half what some straps cost. And it doesn't look cheap at all - quite the opposite."
5,"No frill, works well","Despite being a new DSLR user, I couldn't chuck the original strap fast enough for something softer. The width is right and any wider would not have worked for me(under 5'4"".) My dad's op/tech is wider with longer cushioned portion. I helped him carry his camera often and felt no better than this one. Mine has been to many countries by now and I find it a perfectly serviceable strap. Good price when I got it for less than $13."
1,Packaging doesn't match picture,This ink jet cartridge arrived in the old style packaging not matching the picture and thus suggesting that the vendor is selling new old stock. It cannot be returned successfully because the fine print says that this is sold by an outside vendor so I'm out the price I paid on this ink jet cartridge - so much for saving money on Amazon.
1,Lame,"Don't waste your time with this one. The women aren't very attractive and it looks like it was shot in the 80's. There is no nudity, just old footage of some contests. The worst part is the way it is put together. The lingerie part consists mainly of ""behind the scenes action"" with a lot of lame interviews. The bikini comp. is extremely cheesy. It totally seems to be made for 13 year olds. Save your money and get (...) something since after 10 minutes of this dvd and you'll probably be fast forwarding through the rest to see if it gets any better."
4,Better than the other reviewer says it is!,"He's right, no nudity, and it looks to be older(I'd say the 90's not the 80s though) The better of the two is SUpermodel Lingerie Contest. Some of the girls are quite cute, the best being a brunette that has one of the top 5 butts I have ever seen, right up there with Jessica Biel!!!! Wish they gave names! Worth what the thing is selling for used these days for sure!"
1,False Advertisement/Wrong Movie Displayed,"This is a false advertisement! The cover displayed with Elizabeth Montgomery -vs- what you receive is totally different. I ordered this movie looking for Elizabeth Montgomery, and it is NOT Elizabeth Montgomery's movie! I knew it sounded too good to be true at that price! This movie plays actors/actresses whom nobody ever heard of! What is most disturbing about the whole issue is you don't get what you paid for! Again, this is false advertising, and I am seeking a refund."
5,Incredible indeed,This book is really incredible. Its a remarkable story of faith & survival of this young girl by hiding her real identity moving from town to town in a war torn country. Its a miracle that the author survived this ordeal and she has come out really strong. I am one of the lucky ones to know Betty personally as we are gym-buddies now but I came to know of the book thru another gym buddy as Betty is very modest to even mention that she has written a book. Its an awesome book and this book is going to be in my book collection forever.
4,Great Buy for Younger Girls,I purchased this doll as a gift for my friend's little girl. I was very impressed with the price of the item being that it was a name brand doll. The doll is a little smaller than most dolls so it's just the right size for little arms to hold. The colors on the doll are very bright and inviting. The only down fall of this item is that the clothes are not removeable so it's not a very good doll to play dressup with. But the hair is rooted so that your little girl can enjoy combing and styling Dora's hair. All in all a great doll for the price.
1,DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!,"Initially, the charge lasted for about 25 minutes. I never used it very often because of the short use time.Recently {May 1,2010) I charged it for two days.After the two days I proceeded to use it to take screws out of the door panel on my 1956 Ford F100 pickup truck. It lasted for three screws.After that it was too weak to do anything.I have used this DuraPro 6.0 volt cordless screwdriver forno more than two hours in its history of being.Very disappointed customer."
5,Handy little power driver..,"I bought this to take car parts off of vehicles..It has worked flawlessly and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a powerful screwdriver in a compact design.Sincerely,Bill Morin[...]"
1,Do Not Buy This Drill,"I purchased this drill some time ago and it is the crappiest drill I've ever owned. The battery life is horrible and I'm luck if i can get ten minutes of life before it needs recharging. Also, the fact that it's a 6 volt means it has very little power. Granted it is small and nice to use for tight spaces but I'd rather spend a little more money and buy a ryobi 12 volt drill. Life is a lot better with a 12 volt or 18 volt drill and you'll spend less time charging this flimsy device. Oh, and if you think I'm the only one that dislikes this drill here's something to keep in mind. The fix-it guy, Bob Villa, used to recommend this drill as a low cost alternative to using a screwdriver. He doesn't anymore."
3,durapro 06-141,"I bought the deluxe set for my husband as a Christmas gift in 2005 . He loved it. Over the next 4 years, the drill battery lost power to the point that it wouldn't re-charge - so I recently bought a replacement screwdriver to match the accessories included in the original kit.My husband is again delighted, but I'm somewhat confused. The warranty registration card came back as un-deliverable. Also, the manufacture date on the new device label is 8/25/2003 - well before the date on the original.That probably means that the original production run was grossly over estimated, that there is a warehouse somewhere stuffed with this item, and that the warranty is useless.Nonetheless, it works well for its original purpose. More importantly, my husband once again has a useful tool for 'honeydew' projects around the house."
5,Great product == great provider,The product was as advertised and sent very quickly. I would reccommend this provider to everyone!
4,Need a cord,"It is very good for daily repair and assembling, but not enough power to use as cordless. It is better to use it with cord. So it means that can use it around outlet."
2,Hampton Bulldog Power Clamps,The Bulldogs did not hold 1 olympic plate per side on the bar. The plates moved the collars out toward the sleeve. With each rep the collars moved further down the bar. I wouldn't recommend these collars for barbell curls let alone deadlifts or power cleans...they just don't keep the plates in place on the barbell's inner sleeve.It's too bad because they are nice looking collars and very light aluminum (with a steel cylinder) that supposedly locks against the sleeve. It is my guess that the cylinder because it is just a small rounded steel bar that engages against the sleeve just can't grip on a rounded sleeve and can only slide once bar and plates are in motion. The nylon handle will lock the cylinder in place with less than a full turn which raises doubt to how these clamps could possibly keep plates tight and in place on an olympic bar.
2,Misleading in its Intended Audience,"This volume is strictly aimed towards lay persons serving as elders in various Christian denominations. With the exception of a brief biblical history of the diaconate, it is of little if any use to Deacons or postulates to the diaconate in the Episcopal, Roman Catholic, or Lutheran traditions."
4,Recommended for Assemblies of God Pastors and Boards,"Richard Dresselhaus has written a Biblically based, concise, and practical guide for deacons serving Assemblies of God congregations. Those with dissimilar church governmental structures may not find the book as helpful. The book is designed as a 6-week study for pastors and deacon boards. Suggested group discussion and problem solving questions are provided. The pastor who guides his deacons through a study of ""The Deacon and His Ministry"" can help set the groundwork for a fruitful and enjoyable relationship with his board."
4,Excellent for anyone considering becomming a Deacon,Very helpful...WELL worth the price....Amazon.com has the lowest prices on all the books I have searched for but this book was the best bargain!
5,funny,"I LOVE Chris I think he is so in touch with the world around him. I always love those who can talk about issues that are important but still have fun with them. This is something everyone should see. The only thing that if I can remember correctly was that there was a venue taken from another dvd so a few of the jokes are ones I've seen before. Despite that a must have, could watch it over and over again. :)"
3,Funny But Lacks A Variety Of Subjects,"What I love about Chris Rock most is his spot on insights about daily life. In this performance he reminds us of two things we waste our money on. I also loved his thoughts on George W. Bush's attitude toward the public. He has a pocket full of ___, but won't give you one. This kind of material shows off the genius and creativity of CR. My problem with this show is that he goes on too long about racial issues. The jokes just get too repetitive. If he varied his choice of topics, this performance could have been so much more interesting. Instead, he chose to stay on familiar ground and for that, this performance suffers a bit. Good, but not classic Chris Rock."
5,Hilarious,I was not a big fan of Chris Rock until I saw this film. It made me want to watch all of his other stand up comedies
4,Very entertaining,"I love Chris Rocks comedy. It's not my favorite, but worth having in my collection!"
5,Inteligent music for inteligent people,I have both this CD and the Four Dimonds CD and love them both. The melodies and words that Eileen Hemphill-Haley creates flow together perfectly. I can listen to these CD over and over.
4,Cheaper elsewhere,The toys are great but you can get them MUCH cheaper in the store. Amazon is overpriced with many items!!!
2,Usless in the age of Wikipedia,"This book, which was required for an introduction to graduate studies course I recently took, is nothing more than a specialized, and random, encyclopedia. The other reviews hail this volume as a ""comprehensive resource"" for multiple areas of study. The problem is, the definitions of each term are too broad to be useful to specialists and too random and/or inaccessible for people merely interested in these topics. Most of the terms are all so unrelated that I just don't see the point of owning this book. If you need a definition for ""globalism"" and ""materialism,"" buying this book would be useless. There are plenty of free resources online which also define such terms, and often more comprehensively than this broad overview.I can see why such a volume was viable when it was first printed in the 70's, but why it was reprinted in 2005 is beyond me. This seems to be an intellectual artifact with very little use in the 21st century."
3,good to see Keith Emerson,"This is not the greatest concert, but not bad for the price. Keith Emerson is super and I enjoyed the songs that he had the majority. Mark Bonilla is unimpressive to me. I think he had too much influence on stage figuring it was the Keith Emerson Band. Would have preferred he stayed in the background as the bassist and drummer and shaved."
2,It's NOT better then ELP,"Bought it after reading positive reviews. Great dissapointment. It just doesn't sound like ELP. I admire Marc Bonilla for trying hard and playing ELP music, but sorry, his voice is no match to Gregg's (even now days, with what's left of Gregg's voice). And even more of the same with his guitar playing stile. Basist is o'k but makes the music sound too hard and monotonous for ELP. I don't see anything this guys doing better then original ELP unlike others say. Sound and picture quality is o'k. Bonus material isn't helpful unless somebody enjoys watching naked (Keith's?)ass. I wouldn't recommend this DVD. Buy ELP Live in Montreux instead, it's so much better.P.S. Front photo shows famous church in Petersburg. They couldn't find any nice shot in Moscow?"
2,"Noisy, Self Indulgent","I'm glad Keith is still working in spite of his current physical maladies with his hands. Bonilla provides a good foil to Emerson's return to the stage without his ELP bandmates. But the live gig in Hungary, available as a bonus DVD with the Keith Emerson Band CD, is so much better. The Hungary rhythm section (bass and drums) was fresh and edgy. The Moscow rhythm section is not. I wouldn't really recommend this DVD: many of the works--most notably, Lucky Man and Tarkus--were marred by all that ""heavy metal jamming"" at the end. Also, I recall how cheesy Emerson's workstation pianos sounded this time around...Nice to have an official live version of ""Touch and Go."" The Finale from the recent album is pretty thrilling, if not a little chaotic..."
5,Outstanding product,"Well packaged, clear manual in English and Spanish, well illustrated. Phillips screw driver was only tool necessary. A volt meter would be helpful if you are installing in a house which is ""pre-wired"" with two switches... one for the fan and one for the light. Fan and blades together weigh 26 lbs according to the box, so be prepared to hold the motor slightly above your head for a few seconds. I have 10 foot ceilings. Purchased an 18 inch downrod on a different website to match color. Globe fixture casts a rotating pattern on the ceiling. Downward facing lights would have preventing this. Maybe the manufacturer could have placed a shield above the globe. I own a solar powered house, so Energy Star fan important. High speed uses same power as 60 watt bulb."
2,Don't get 2 of same kind - same frequency that can't be changed,Our boys each got one for Christmas so they can battle each other - but the remote controllers are on the same frequency and can't be changed (that we can figure out) so they can't use them together unfortunately.
3,This is seminar text for the classroom,"It took me three hours to read this 150+ page book. It's really a superficial sourcebook for seminars and focus groups.It's chapters are very relevant because they were written by the people who are directly influencing policy.This book is very comprehensive, but superficial. For the student of Bioterrorism, this book is flimsy. For the teacher-this book would be an excellent intro to concept's, key words and history.The book contains problem set's, just like a textbook. It's references are superlative and are it's second best attribute, and the best reason for owning it."
5,A great series,"Though not the most beautiful anime to look at, Saiunkoku is an amazing series. I was very drawn in by the subtleties of the characters, and my ability to remember so many, when usually I am so bad at remembering. I am not usually a fan of Shoujo, but this had real heart and strength in it's characters, which I was pleasantly surprised to find mostly not stereotypes, and a very strong, and interesting political plot, with a good strong female character who isn't combative. I was also fascinated by an anime which didn't have a huge amount of fighting (I suppose that is fitting considering the main character cannot fight). I came to find interest in the jealousies, or lack there-of between characters, and a few surprisingly sad moments, with relatively deep ""villian"" characters. Just, wonderful all around, highly recommended!"
4,Hussling in Buenos Aires,"This comedy is set in Buenos Aires' Jewish community inside a little shopping mall in a heart of the city. Central character is Ariel, young man who seems to have no direction in his life. While his brother is trying to sell trinkets, his mother is busy tending to her lingerie shop. Ariel's circle of friends are other merchants at the mall. There seems to be very little business around and Ariel is trying to find his way out. Anyone who knows the misery of Argentine economy can understand this film quite well. But it really gets quite absurd when Ariel thinks that living in Poland where his grandparets escaped from in 1940s is better than where he is now and he starts plotting to leave the country. Lots of interesting characters and funny moments in this cute little film."
3,Just me,The case is excellent except for the shoulder strap bieng in the wrong areaGator GC-Tenor Sax Molded ABS Case
3,Aptly Titled,"In this well-written book, Michael Harper manages what many haven't: He explains why he has changed from one religious group to another without deeply offending those in his former church. In a calm tone lacking triumphalism but demonstrating warm conviction, the author sets forth his path into Orthodoxy and provides brief apologetic answers to common objection frequently raised against his new-found faith."
1,DVD Not As Advertised!,"I assumed since this DVD was released in 2010, and is being sold directly by Amazon at a much lower price than another version offered on the site for around $90 by individual sellers, that it was U.S. product. It is not. The DVD was apparently manufactured in Korea. It has Korean subtitles and the entire back DVD cover is composed in Korean! The quality of the DVD is fine, but having seen this movie years ago and having waited for a U.S. version to come out for a long time, I was disappointed to receive the DVD and find that it's not only a Korean verstion, but that the back DVD cover is in Korean. More disheartening is that it is not advertised as such on Amazon. If those things concern you, as they do me, I would advise you to stay away."
4,"Sleazy, Sordid And, I Guess You Could Say: 'Scandalous'","I didn't expect much out of this when I was saw it about 15 years ago on VHS, but it turned to be quite interesting. The only problem was, when I watched it a second time, was it has too much a sleazy feel to it and an obvious political agenda.There is a lot of nudity in here, lots of it mainly with Bridget Fonda who plays ""Mandy Rice-Davies"" and Joanne Whalley-Kilmer as ""Christine Keeler."" Whalley-Kilmer looked particularly beautiful.John Hurt as ""Stephen Ward"" and Ian McKellen's ""John Profumo"" are the male stars. The story is about Britain's ""Profumo Affar,"" as it was labeled back then - a sex scandal involving English politicians in the early 1960s.In what could be a dry account turns out to be a fascinating movie, well-acted and beautifully-photographed. It is sordid, though, and that will offend a number of people."
5,Love Songs by Andre Rieu...EXCELLENT,"I thoroughly enjoyed this latest CD produced by Andre Rieu. I really enjoy his typically high quality musician craft manifested in this album. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves classical music featuring, as the title suggests, love songs."
2,Love Songs,Did not enjoy most of the songs and was quite disappointed oveerall. He could have do e much better overall
2,Get's sticky too quickly,"Maybe it's only meant for internal use, but when applied to the body in open air situations ID glide turns sticky fairly quick. It's annoying to have to reapply it every few minutes."
2,Gets sticky,"Nice at first, but gets sticky. I got a multi sample pack and compared 11 different brands; this was one of the sticky ones. Though I do like the water based WAAAAAY more than the oily stuff, if it gets sticky it defeats the purpose."
3,Net Study Guide Helps with Math but not with Reading,"I just got finished taking the NET test. The math is presented much the same way as is covered in the book. However, the reading (critical thinking) part is not described in the book the same way it is presented in the test. The worse part involves questions regarding inference where deductive reasoning is to be used. Book needs to be updated."
3,Helpful book,I have several study guides but no school uses the NET any more. I ordered this before all the schools switched over. So stuck with the book? No. This guide is small and very helpful to review the content I need to study for the exams. It explains content a lot better than other guides. The book came quickly and was in good condition.
5,Great review book,"I never actually took the NET test because I scored so well on their pretest, but this book is a really good one with relatively few errors. The errors are easy to spot so don't let this discourage you."
1,Disappointed,"I was really hoping that this nozzle was going to be great, but, it's not. It was a waste of my money. The setting for the water to stream out with some pressure is very poor. My cheap nozzle (even with the drip) does a much better job. This nozzle is NOT worth the money.....save your money!"
2,Sprayer leaks - not made well,"The adjustable spray is great but in the first month of use, the base of the nozzle began leaking and spraying all over me every time I used it. It just doesn't seem to be made well."
1,Waste of money,"Bought this 5 months ago and thought it was a great nozzle; worked well, easy to use. Now, less than six months later, it has sprung minute leaks over the entire unit. Very strange, but obviously useless now. Save your money."
1,Worked fine..... For a few months,"I bought the Claber Multi-Jet Pistol at a home improvement store in California for what I thought was a good price, around $15. It was wonderful for about 6 months when the trigger began to get stuck in the on position. Jiggling the trigger would sometimes allow it to shut off but it soon would jam again. Next I ran into the problem the earlier reviewer found, changing the spray pattern unscrewed the filter screen and totally ruined the spray pattern.This product is not well made. Save your money"
5,Great CD! (Karaoke),"This was worth every cent. It doesn't have her earlier work, but has many hits! It includes graphics on screen!"
4,goo brass band jazz,"A good fun time with this brass band Jazz CD. Their more recent ""Gimme My Money Back"" is even better, capturing the great live style of the Treme Brass Band. Every song on here is good except for ""All of Me"" which is ruined by some dreadful singing."
5,get to know the pixies,"a candid documentary following the greatest band to ever rock. more concerned with honest footage than just looking cool, see the pixies for the people they are, flaws and all, and love them all the more for overcoming all that to reunite and rock the world all over again. hail to the PIXIES!"
2,"Not sure what the intent was for this, far too candid","While I am not a big Pixies fan, I do appreciate them, and wanted to learn a little more about them. After watching this, I didnt come away with anything really. I watched the whole thing, waiting for something to happen, or to learn some insight into their process, but it never happened.This isn't going to gain them any new fans, at least thats my impression. Someone else might find meaning in it. But, to me, this film is so candid, that it's kind of hard for an outsider to get into it, unless you are a die hard fin I guess, then maybe it will strike you as fasinating.Oh well, maybe a different type of documentary will come out in the future that will provide better insight into the band."
3,Version noir et blanc en anglais et couleur en franais,Ce film sur la vie de Napoléon est relativement bien fait. Sacha Guitry raconte la vie de Napoléon en se mettant dans la peau du Prince de Talleyrand qui fut Ministre des affaires étrangères de la France tant sous Napoléon que sous Louis XVIII. Il est regrettable que la seule version disponible sur Amazon soit en anglais seulement et en noir et blanc alors que la version originale est en couleur et en franais. Le ton est un peu chauvin mais Napoléon n'est-il pas un des plus grands franais? C'est un film intéressant à voir.
2,Film Franais Extraordinaire si vous ne parlez pas Franais,"Excellent film, avec excellent acteurs et très bon scénario. Dommage que l'on ne puisse pas avoir la version originale en Franais sur un DVD fait par des Franais...."
3,Pro Tec IT Band Wrap,"Have IT syndrome, used the band once so far and did not help...working on using foam roller to massage the IT band area, stretching more then will give this another review...I would say you need to use it at least 5 times to really determine if it is going to help...HOPE SO!!!"
2,Don't Buy It For The Artwork...,"As a huge fan of the original Rogers/Austin run, with its clean, meticulous detail and sophisticated style, I was shocked at the poor quality of the artwork in this collection. Hints of the old flair are very few and far between, and most of the book is simply unattractive. Additionally, the lettering is atrocious. Once the disappointment wears off, you've got a halfway decent story to enjoy."
5,Perfect,Exactly as described. Much better than plastic rings purchased previously that cut your hands in use and have markings that fade away. Excellent quality and handy case.
3,"Not 4.2""","I bought this set for the largest cutter which i was to believe was 4.2""....well it's not it's 3.5"". The case is 4.2"". Not pleased with the description. The set in general is not bad but not excellent....so I give it an average rating."
2,discoloration and poor seams! I sent it back,"I've been a looking for a set of round cutters for a while, and this set was affordable and had a lot of sizes. But when i received it, the parts where the two ends of the cutter met were discoloured. I was put off by the discolouration (it looked like rust stains, though I'm sure they are probably welding discolorations), and the seam wasn't completely closed, so that dough might be able to be get trapped. Needless to say I returned the item.The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because of Amazon's return policy. It worked seemless. I printed out the return label and dropped the box in a fed ex dropbox near my work. At no additional shipping cost, I was able to send the offending item back and in due course received a full refund. Way to go Amazon!"
3,"Crummy plastic case, cutters are fine",The clear plastic case that the cutters come in is horrible. The lid is extremely tight and requires a lot of strength to pry it off.
4,Good except for case,"The set was good except that the case was broken when I received it because it came in a padded package, not a box."
2,Not the quality I expected.,"Not the quality I expected. Poor seams, not as sturdy overall - metal is thin and not very good quality. I'm sending this set back."
3,Disappointing,"The feeling I got when I finished this book was ""where was the proof reader during the publishing process?"". Maybe I'm being a little hard on the publisher, but this is supposed to be a book designed to prepare the reader for an exam, and as such, should be carefully reviewed for errors. It has the potential to be a sound review given the breadth of topics covered, but the number of typos damage its credibility. I've worked with this technology for almost a year in the working world, and found the misprints annoying at best. I shouldnt have to debug the examples, as didactic as it may be, and I can only imagine how someone with less experience would feel navigating this book. My recommendation: Fire the proof reader, correct the mistakes and publish the errata. Then you'll have a useful text."
5,A gift,My sisterfriend got this movie from Blockbuster and I am blessed to have gotten the opportunity to see it. It is truly a gift to see a movie sans sex and profanity. The other plus for me was that the message is one I feel needs to be shared.
1,Misleading,Even though the title of the product is Hummingbird it does not work with all Hummingbird fish locators. Had to modify to get it to work - the black attachment was too narrow for the transducer
3,"Great Book, but Worth $...?","This book was very helpful to learn updated statistical methods to analyze microarray data, but I wanted a little more of thorough explanation and algorithm details for each method. I felt this was a bit too expensive for the content. I would not recommend to people who do not have basic understanding of a variety of clustering and classification techniques."
4,Three Tragedies,"Alejandro González Iñárritu usually mixes three stories together, (Babel, 21 grams, amores perros).The score in this feature creates the bitter mood that envelopes the entire endeavor. A mathematician, a widow, and an ex-con someone become entwined in a rollercoaster of emotions and tragedies.It will keep you guessing, its one of the most depressing films that I have seen, yet it creates a scar that you will never forget."
1,This movie is WEAK,Do not waste your time. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your time. Zero stars is more appropriate.
1,so cool,I've never seen a movie more pretentious than this. I can't handle it past 30 minutes. There are too many close-ups on Sean Penn showing how cool he smokes a cigarette. Get over yourselves people.
4,"Another way of making movies,1st you must see AMORES PERROS","This director made Amores Perros, a hard, bloody story about lives that got together in a tragic moment. A mexican movie, sets the standard for 21 grams. So I recommend both of them, but I suggest you to see the mexican one first.A very good selection if you are looking for something different."
3,Not all that,"I felt a bit let down and disappointed with this film, having brought my respect for Inarritu close to deification after 'Amores Perros'. This film was not close to his first. However, avoiding comparisons and taking the film on it's own merits (?), this was fundamentally a Lego-built film that followed the standard plot blueprint, but given a veneer of credibility by means of a broken timeline. But the non-linear nature of the editting was merely a conceit and had no effect on the essence of the storyline ('Memento', anyone?). The acting was, admittedly, first-rate and it's good to see three top-class actors vying for the limelight, with each holding it in their own way, but their input acted only as a prop to an average script rather than lift this film to loftier heights."
3,How to Make a Portentous Film:,"Get some really good actors who like juicy, serious roles. They will be able to put a veneer of respectability on the unbelievable script you're working with. Then slice up your story continuity so that the film viewer is too busy putting the jigsaw pieces together again to notice how bad the story is... at first.I'm a huge fan of all the principal actors (Penn, Watts, del Toro) and they managed to overcome some of this film's problems. But it's hard to hide a bad script."
3,Tedious and disappointing...,"...especially compared to the director's previous film, the instant classic ""Amores Perros"" (""Love is a bitch"").It feels like an inferior recycling of the first film in both themes and narrative technique, just without the sparkling freshness, originality, and effortless flow.Al Pacino, Naomi Watts, and Benecio Del Toro are all world-class actors but they don't have much to work with here.Oh well, I guess this is what they call the ""sophomore slump."""
2,"Amazing movie, no features.","I can't say enough about this movie, I absolutely loved it. But the dvd itself lacks special features of any kind. No commentary, no featurettes, nothing of any kind. I would have loved to be able to hear what the director and stars had to say about this movie, it was definitly one of the best movies i've seen in a long time. But I think for now, unless they put out another edition with some kind of special features on it, i would just rent this....a lot. Thats the reason this gets 2 stars, i think a lot of people rate the movie and not the actual item itself."
3,Highly improbable,The storyline to this film was highly implausible but the fine acting especially by Sean Penn carrys this one.If you want a feel good movie with a happy ending don`t watch this one it will leave you feeling thoroughly depressed but in a reflective `what`s life all about kinda way`.
4,depressing..,"Can describe this film. This film was really great. This is one of those films that makes you say ""wow...that's pretty sad"" and what these 3 characters go through is really sad but you know the sad truth is...This happens in reality.I thought Del Toro should have won an oscar for this. This had some really great acting. I really enjoyed this film. All 3 actors did a fine job on this film. Was it amazing?..nah. Was it groundbreaking or something new? No. But was this a really good film that will probably put you through a sad state for a few minutes. Yes.21 grams is a great film though I will say DO NOT PURCHASE THE DVD if you're expecting some extras. Other then that...Great film.4 out of 5."
3,Three Stars for the Three Stars,"The three lead actors in this film give great performances, but I had a hard time getting emotionally involved because of the editing. I'd been distracted by my curiosity of how the story was going to fall together.In a film like THE ENGLISH PATIENT (another non-linear storyline), the filmmakers gave you enough time to get involved with the plight of the characters. In 21 GRAMS, the cuts are so abrupt and frequent that you never get a chance to really bond with the characters.Instead of feeling their pain, you're left saying, ""Oh, that's how that fits together.""But the three actors here are among the best acting in film today, so it's definitely worth seeing for that."
3,"Watchable, but not a masterpiece","21 Grams is watchable, but tries to be too clever. Going backwards and forwards in time has been done so much better in other films. It really wasn't necessary for this film, and in a waty detracted from the performances.21 Grams has been acclaimed as Naomi and Sean's shining moments. Let me say that Sean Penn is excellent, but Naomi didn't deliver the extraordinary performance that I was expecting (based on her Oscar nomination). On top of that her character lost credibility. One minute she says that ""nothing will bring them back"", then in a future scene she wishes to kill the man who did it.21 Grams is a watchable piece of film, but could have been so much more ... a better script, for starters would have helped."
4,Non-linear movie-making at its best....,"21 Grams is the most non-linear movie I've seen to date. You know how Pulp Fiction jumps around in time? Well this movie outdoes it a hundred-fold. Pulp Fiction was divided up into chapters so that the audience never REALLY got lost. I'm curious to see what the shooting script for this film was like - if it was written this way or if the effect was completely created in the editing room. EVERY SCENE takes place at a different point in the story and almost NO TWO SCENES follow consecutively. It's fascinating to watch the movie unfold. True, it is a gimmick, but it is a gimmick that works. As we see bits of the end and bits of the beginning, we strain to put all the pieces together and understand what is happening. This process may be vexatious for the occasional movie-goer - he will become lost and bored with a plot that doesn't unfold in a straightforward manner. However, for film buffs, it is sure to fascinate."
5,One of my all time favorites,"Great movie, not going to ruin it for everyone. Takes a few times to watch it to get the whole thing in order, which makes buying the DVD that much more worth it."
2,The movie confusion personified!,"I know this movie has great acting. I am NOT arguing that fact. However, the chronology is a spaghetti of backwards threads. Tom Clancy is a master of telling stories with many intricate threads masterfully woven into a COHERENT master story. This is a case study in bad editing. I wanted to enjoy this movie and its actors. I kept searching for a theme to follow. I was utterly disappointed. The story is told backwards. How can you develop a character backwards? I wanted to feel for these characters. I wanted to understand these characters emotions and motivations. I was lost from the very beginning. I remained interested - guessing that the director was soon going to reveal the main theme. Nope. The movie is a dramatic well-acted flop. Do not waste your money. 2 stars only for acting. ZERO stars to the editing choices!"
1,21 trash,"This film is a perfect waste of time. The one redeeming quality it holds is that the film makers assume the audience is intelligent! The pretentiousness of the film makers is all over the place. It is a perfect film for sycophantic movie goers that wear black clothes all the time and smoke Gitane cigarettes, and they also happen to be film majors at Univesity."
3,Fun for all the family!!!,"My 3yr old daughter recommended this film to me, and we watched it on a triple bill with Bambi and Spy Kids.I loved the action adventure set-pieces, while my little girl laughed every time Naomi Watts tried to eat sugar through a straw...with her nose!!! There was even a tantalising glimpse of Sean Penn's pasty white left butt for my wife to enjoy. Good times :)Pros1. It's too short2. Highly original cartoon dream sequence.Cons.1. The acting is a bit wooden in places.*SPOILER*The diets are all successful and by the end they each weight just 21 grams! Yay!"
2,wierd for the sake of being weird,"This movie would have been alot better if Woody Allen would have played Sean Penn's part. I have read in a few books that you will know if you like, or dislike, a movie within the first 10 minutes. This one took 1:40 to realize it sucked. I give it 2 stars, one for cinematography and one for del Torro's spectacular performance. Should movie buffs/students watch it, yes. Is it entertaining, no."
1,AMERICA'S CRITIC,SUCH A WASTE OF MY TIME AND DISSAPPOINTMENT WHAT WAS I THINKING BLAH BLAH BLAH--- GO GET SCARFACE AND WATCH THE 100000GRAMS ON TONYS DESK... BETTER YET LOW BUDGET FILMS BEAT THIS ONE DOWN TO THE DIRT!!!BENICIO DEL TORO GREAT ACTOR THATS ALL IN THIS FLICK
2,21 Grams... a misleading title.,"The film was titled ""21 Grams"". It's explanation for that title is that when a person dies, after it's soul leaves, 21 Grams mysteriously is lost from your body. A very interesting concept, but it had nothing to do with the film. The mystery of 21 grams leaving your body is never explored.What is left is a film filled with miserably sad people who are suffering from losses they have sustained and fighting personal demons. I think Sean Penn is a rare talent, but he is not nearly enough to carry this downer of a film.""21 Yawns"" is a better title.It is said that after viewing this film, in it's entirety, that all the yawning that is done, when measured in breathe and water release, amounts to 21 Grams.If THAT was the overall goal, then the film was a huge success.Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yawn...Yep... 21 Grams."
2,Not Impressed,"Was pretty disappointed. Great actors, decent story, but the direction left a bit to be desired. Choppy flashbacks and forwards, confusing instead of leading you into the story."
3,One unbelievable character,"In the beginning, this film is interesting and otherwise very good, but Sean Penn's character makes the movie unwatchable. He is portrayed as a previous transplant recipient who must undergo the procedure again, yet he is constantly smoking. What surgeon, under similar conditions, would operate on him?"
1,21 grams = 2.1,"21 grams = 2.1 hours of my life that I won't get back. This movie didn't accomplish what I thought it would. It had all of the ingredients for a good movie, but somehow it didn't gel for me."
2,let's be honest,"The attempt here was to creat ""art"" rather than entertainment, and in so doing failed at both. Worthwhile for some very good acting, but little else. If you like being depressed or feeling smart by saying you enjoy bleak, artsy films, this one's for you."
2,Please!,"Like Lost in Translation, I guess this movie was ""too artistic"" for me. I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't this slow, dragging mess. The concept was good, however the presentation lacked a real plot. It reminded me a little bit of Pulp Fiction but not nearly as entertaining. It just dragged on and on and on. Please!"
2,Mediocre at best,"This movie is not nearly as good as people said it was, so be glad you didn't pay $9 to see it in the theater. Rent it before you buy it. I didn't come out of the theater going ""Whoa."" The title has more to do with life than with drugs. And Sean Penn as a math professor? Really? The acting was good, though. BOTTOM LINE: IT'S NOTHING SPECIAL, SO NOT A BIG DEAL IF U SKIP IT. GRADE:C+"
5,Intense and magnificent,"This is not an easy movie. Don't watch it alone. It's intensely complex with deeply interwoven plot lines that automagically come together. Like an Altman movie, it's out of sequence so you are utterly confused for the first 30 minutes but then it all starts coming together. Sean Pean and Naomi Watts are absolutely brilliant. There is deep sadness in this movie and very little redemption - no hollywood ending, but a real, raw, human ending."
4,"Rough, but worth it","21 grams, directed by Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalex Inarritu takes us through the stories of three characters, played by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro, in an un-chronological way. Penn plays a dying man in need of a heart transplant whose wife desperately wants a child before he goes. Watts plays a wife and mom trying to get past her drug addiction and return to a stable life. Del Toro's story is the most interesting of the three as an ex-con who begins to straighten up his life convinced that Jesus has given him another chance at it. These three characters all come colliding together in interesting ways, and it is truly a movie that makes you think. There are some very rough edges of the film, with rough scenes to go along with it, but the film's intention and terrific acting make it one that I want to see again."
3,"Great Performances, Downer Script","21 Grams is a film of undeniable artistry and fine performances. It also makes for very uncomfortable viewing. The non-sequential nature didn't bother me (and I don't really buy the comparisons to Memento, this film is more jumbled up than 'backwards'). The problem for me was the lack of hope. Surely all of us fear that phone call, that accident, that illness that will strike one of us down. God knows, I've thought about it - but I don't necessarily want to live it vicariously. Love doesn't save the characters, faith deserts them, repentence and good deeds go unrewarded...realistic, yes, but too much so.I never thought I would long for a sappy Hollywood ending, but this movie provoked just such a reaction. I also had a minor quibble with the plot (why was the Naomi Watts character so forgiving, then so vengeful?). I guess the bottom line for me is - great job to everyone involved, but would it hurt to lighten the mood just a little next time?"
1,"Oscar sells, but this is just Bad","I can't stand this film. I couldn't get through the film the first time around. I've finally decided to sit through it (on my 3rd round) coz I don't want to waste the money I spent on it and there's nothing good on TV. Plus, I'm curious why Sean won an Oscar for it. The plot build sooooo slowly. The first 20 minutes are just jumbled-up plots that don't seem to be have any connections... but you wait and wait and wait for it to happen and it's maddeningly slow to come. It's worse than watching your bad dreams & trying to make any meaning out of it. If you're not particularly patient and love action movies, save your money and pass on this! I think Sean should have won his oscar for ""I am Sam"", but the Academy tends to give out overdues than current."
1,"DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!","The right trailer can make any plodding, incoherent art film look like a thriller. The only reason this poorly written and impossible to believe peice of junk gets one star is the solid work of Naomi Watts, as usual Penn overacts and Del Toro iscompletely incoherent. Like Traffic, the director believes he must use lens filters to make us feel the emotions of these hollow characters, it fails here, too. Apparently, Focus Features liked this film so much that they decided it stood fine on it's own on DVD, since there are no special features at all. I really wanted to hear the idiot responsibe for this 9th rate script and amateurish direction explain his ""vision""."
1,Worst movie of the year?,"This movie moves extremely slow and the story line is disjointed. There is about enough interesting material to fill a 30 minute TV show, however this is a two hour movie. I like nearly every movie I see, but this was agony just to watch until the end. If you want to throw your money away, just flush it down the toilet, at least then you don't have to pay S&H."
2,Overrated,"While not totally worthless, this movie was a considerable disappointment. It takes a lot of energy to watch, and other than some nice scenes of Naomi Watts naked, there isn't a whole lot of reward for your effort. I think that with this format the filmmakers went out on a considerable limb. And in today's day and age, any movie that includes two or more of the following: 1) jerky camera techniques 2) drugs 3) confusing plot 4) pretentious emotional bombshell acting; will surely be a success. So unfortunately I think I understand why people like this movie."
2,Suicidally Depressing...,"A well-crafted, brilliantly acted movie.Unfortunately, it is also hideously dismal, and with no moral message to offer which would justify such unredeemable and violent gloominess.This movie makes ""Sid and Nancy"" seem like a comedy.Watch it once and you'll stare numbly at the floor for a few hours when it is finished; watch it twice and you're friends and family will have to call the authorities and put you on suicide watch.No thanks.Gimme my 2 hours back."
2,"Mundane Story, Amature Presentation, Good Acting","This is a run-of-the-mill story line chopped up into little pieces and pasted back together again in a feable attempt to make it artistic. There is the standard introspective stuff and the not so subtle question of God's existance so many people think is still provactive...blah, blah, blah, so what. Another problem is the characters. While not bad people, they are just not very likable or interesting. Clocking in at two hours and five minutes it seemed three hours and fifty five minutes as the story develops at a snail's pace. As others have said there is some decent acting here, especially by Naomi Watts so I'll offer two stars for that, otherwise this is just another average flick. Quentin Tarantino mastered this presentation style and it is interesting and well done in his films, but I'll be glad when this fad dies because in the hands of lesser talented directors like Alejandro González Iñárritu it is just annoying."
2,Bleak and depressing look at bleak and depressing indiviuals,"The color, backdrops, pace and acting (yes, the acting was very good) lent to a very ""downer"" of a movie. Sure, I've watched a lot of movies that have had ongoing depressing scenes that ended in a sad story. Well, this is one of them.Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts give their best to a movie that shows the down-trodden lives of people who've hit bottom in some very tragic circumstances. You get a taste of betrayal, deception, lies and confusion, all rolled into one.I really don't know how to truly classify this movie other than that I would never want to watch it again. Yes, it is a ""thought-provoking"" movie with some very emotional and touching moments, but there is no reward in the end."
2,Hyped Garbage,"I hated this movie. It was so slow and annoying, filled with over-the-top acting and a story that jumps all over the place. I understand that the directing was different because the movie goes back and forth through time to explain the story, but this wasn't interesting to me. It just served to confuse and make the movie move along at a snail's pace. The more Sean Penn films I see, the more I am starting to think that he ain't so great. Naomi Watts was so annoying in this movie and I'm sorry, but I felt no sympathy for her at all. Benicio Del Toro was great, but he is great in everything so it was no surprise that he did a great job in his role. Ultimately, this is a slow movie that is way overrated. I didn't enjoy this film and was very happy when it was over. I give it 2 stars because it tried to do something different."
1,If you love depression and confusion...,"There are plenty of reviews here that relate the storyline, so I just want to mention two things about this movie that will affect your decision on whether to watch it or not.First, this movie is VERY depressing. It's about death, disease, and the destruction of lives. If you think you're subjected to enough of that stuff out here in the real world, don't watch it!Second, this movie is not linear. It jumps around A LOT, and you will probably not fully understand where everything ties in until at least halfway through. It is NOTHING like Memento. That movie, while backwards, was linear, and after the first few scenes, it was easy to figure out the method. If you're like me and lose interest easily, you probably won't finish 21 Grams.I know a lot of people liked this film, but these are two very strong factors you should consider before you spend your money or time on this one."
2,Incomplete,An incomplete order. The support braces 12 in. wide were not included as describe in the product. Disappointed as the package appeared to have been opened and repackaged.
4,Good one,"My daughters are using this beam now daily :) I like the quality, and as to me this is a good beam for home use.I did not give 5 stars only because my daughters say the beam is slippery - may be because it is the combination of soft top+suede(material) instead of just wood. May be it would be better just to have a beam made from wood only - as the real gymnastics beam. But since it was my choice to go with suede covered one, I do not blame the company. Just not 5 star happy with the purchase."
5,balance beam,This is a wonderful product. It is light and easy to move yet sturdy enought for my husband to (try) and walk/turn on it. My daughter improved her balance beam score the following meet just from the additional practice at home. She is 11 and practices on it every day.
2,Glorified heating pad,All it is is a inexpensive glorified heating pad. I use it for sore muscles to increase circulation in the area. It doesn't cause me to sweat at the highest level. I should have went for the lower grade version as the other two pads aren't very useful for me.
2,Misunderstood,I thought this was the series from the UK. Boy was I wrong. This is not my taste in music.
5,Make mine a snakebite!,"One of the funniest, raunchiest shows to be seen on satelite in the UK right now.The story line follows two couples and a very odd friend and they do little but talk about sex and drink. But it is genius!Watch my American friends and just enjoy!"
5,A brilliant sequel to a child's introduction to spanish.,Say Hola to Spanich Otra Vez is a wonderful book filled with colorful pictures (written by a four time picture book author) and a wonderful glossary of useful spanish phrases.
2,"visually pleasing, but not durable","I bought this item about 8 months ago and it is now completely non-functional. The push-button release to pour coffee no longer works (sticks open only) and the bottom pad fell off. It fell off the table in the lunchroom and promptly got two large dents in it. Even while it worked, the push-button pour release mechanism is difficult to clean and might harbor some nasty bacteria. It's a cool looking design, but unfortunately not made of very good quality materials. Keep looking..."
3,beginners with chocolate: Do I like chocolate,"This book is for students on a early reader level. It consist of 3 to 4 word sentences. However, it helps the reader understand why they like chocolate."
1,Pseudoscience,"As a physician who is very interested in spirituality I was eager to read Hawkins work. What a disappointment! He has taken some worthy mystical concepts and created a weird pseudoscientific approach which has no research validity. This book is frightening since he apparently has a large following. Hope he doesn't start a ""Hawkinsville."""
2,Another Winner from Dr. Hawkins! (5 Stars),"This book, along with his prior three publications, is a must for those who are genuinely interested in freedom and the art of awakening living.Transcending the Levels of Consciousness offers the readers an in-depth understanding or the arising of the ego in the classic style of Dr. Hawkins.It is clear from this book that Dr. Hawkins is urging identification of the obstacles to enlightenment so that they can be transcended, just as Eckhart Tolle advises in The Power of Now and Mick Quinn in Power and Grace. As the Dalai Lama said: Change only takes place through action. Frankly speaking not through prayer or meditation, but through action. This new book is all about the action of transcending the ego and how to do that!! The world is finally awakening to ions of conditioning (the ego) and this new book blazes a trial to guide the courageous to end all unnecessary suffering in this lifetime.My star rating is 5! It was mistakenly entered at 2."
5,GPS for the Spiritual Seeker,"If your interests include both psychology and spirituality, this book is a perfect match. After you've absorbed it, you will know very precisely your position, the position of others, and all important waypoints on the map of consciousness. It will lead you very close to the ""treasure"" that you seek.Hawkins gives us his most articulate and well-organized writing here. He provides a detailed psychoanalysis of each of the levels of consciousness, an explanation of the dualities and obstructions for each, and techniques for advancing to higher levels. Woven through the erudite and at times rather technical psychological treatment is the spiritual viewpoint. I found it useful not only for internal spiritual progress, but for better understanding the behavior and thinking of other people in my life who could help, or hinder, my progress. It's a must-read."
4,An absolute must for Spiritual Growth,This book will give the insight you've been looking for and help identify with emotions that can take us down or build us up!!
5,Always happy with Amazon,Again I purchased second hand and the service was impeccable. The book looked as new as always is the case with Amazon.
3,Amazing book for those on the spiritual path...kindle edition fail,"I just want to say my ego was disappointed the kindle version did not that have the charts/map of consciousness/ etc that are an important part of this book They are in the paperback/hardcover version and absent here, for reasons I can't comprehend. Those charts and dualities of each level was one the main reasons I purchased this version, so I could have a more portable version for spiritual ""work"". Just a warning for those buying the Kindle version, buy hardcover or paperback instead."
5,Amazing,"Thank you Dr. Hawkins for this powerful gift of transformation. If you are seeking an end to your suffering, or happiness, success, salvation or enlightenment, and are willing to do the work to get there, BUY THIS BOOK! It is the road map to your future."
4,A great primer for evolutionary transcending,"I really enjoyed this book, and other books by Hawkins. Very useful and worthwhile in describing and explaining the different states of consciousness that can go with the different stages of consciousness. But since he only focuses on state levels, his work is true but partial. This is how it is, but I did wish that his teachings were more fuller, more comprehensive in enlightenment teachings. But that is what other books do, especially ones like Integral Spirituality, which is a more fuller, comprehensive book on enlightenment and levels of consciousness. Nevertheless, I do rate this book high as it is good enough as a primer for these different levels. Certainly not a be all and end all book though, that would be False, and which calibrates as such, but True as a excellent primer!"
3,"better than the legend of OMC, but...","This book suffers less than most of Rodengen's work. His style of connecting his magazine articles into a complete book is improving. The coroprate history is accurate and for the most part complete. Still there is some of the redundancy of background supplied in each magazine article. Where I'd edit out 35% to 40% of the OMC book to make it easier to read and clearer, the Merc book only needs a 15% to 20% reduction to get to the point. Particularly disappointing in this book is the chapter on racing. Almost no research seems to have been done here. Merc's reputation was built on racing, but its a very small sideline in this book. I can not recommend the book to racing fans, not much more here than what is in Iron Fist. If you have none of the earlier books this would be a good place to start."
5,An Interesting Book,I found this book an interesting read. Great photos of the early days of Mercury really add to the quality of this book.
5,Wonderful Product and Price,Great Product for the price Biobizz Bio-Bloom is a great fertilzer. I buy this every year so keep up the great work. Thanks
3,"Boogie, Boogie, Blah.","Boogiepop Phantom's 12 episodes of scattered narratives, and darting time lines, center around a magical beam of light that turns humans into hybrid creatures of the future who cannot exist on this plane. The world is not ready for them. The magical light also allows dangerous creatures into the world who collide and hide in people. That's about it. The story(ies) arc tries hard to be mysterious by purposefully obscuring details. It doesn't feel mysterious. It feels unorganized. The tale comes together slowly, in a disappointing, anti-climatic manner. When crucial plot points were revealed, I'd already figured out the puzzle, and I'm not one to figure things out ahead of time unless they're pretty obvious. The final disc is pointless and adds nothing to the story. It's just drawn out closure on top of more drawn out closure. For all of its' oh-so-clever presentation, Boogiepop is a lot of sick and shimmer with no substance. Mildly gruesome. Not for kids. Three-ish stars."
3,flawed ?,"this is an easy to read quick little book like his others some readers may well bulk at some of his assertions [understandably so] but the gist of his position doesnt lack validity , I would'nt recommend this as a starter for this topic ,but it's worth a read."
4,soothing,"Only 60 minutes. Could use more time for my yoga classes. There are melodies that seem to have gaps in it although the ohm vibration is present. Some of my students don't like that, I find it soothing. One melody has a part that sounds like a creaking ship out on the ocean, I think it is supposed to be a whale at sea. Good for meditation or a meditative class."
2,less then ok,"It started out great, was able to teach about diffeent things but then I had to deal with lots of tears when nothing grew"
5,Best book I have ever read.,This was one of the best books I had ever read. I was so excited when I found out that there was a sequel. I lost both of my copies and have been searching for years for replacements. I would love to find them. If anyone out there has any idea where I can find these books please e-mail me.
2,Dry Reading,"I could never put my finger on what was wrong with this story. I liked the story idea. The writting was decent. But I was so bored reading this story. What would normally take me a day or two to read, took me a couple of weeks, 'cause I just didn't want to read any more. But, I finally finished the story, only to get to an ending that, well, may make you want to read the next book. But for me, it was hard enough getting through this one. To me, it was just dry. No enough 'something' to hold my interest."
4,great story,"I picked this book up by sheer chance, and finished it that evening. Varek and Christine are great charactors, and kept me interested till the end. I thought the ending was a little abrupt, but at least it was fairly happy. There are some reality problems (6 miscarriages and they don't suspect anything?) but over all I would reccomend this book. Christine and Varek have been married for 10 years, and when Christine can't produce a child, Varek is forced to set her aside. Christine, unable to watch her husband marry another, runs away and marries someone else. When they meet again in venice 6 years later, Varek's wife has died in childbirth and Christine is married with a son. What follows is the struggle Christine has, both against Varek and her desire to be with him.I am definitly going to try her next one ""While you slept""."
2,"Loved Book, Hated Ending","I read this book on vacation, and loved it. Then it ended, and I felt gipped and taken advantage of. I spent a goodly amount of my vacation enthralled by Christina and Varek, only to have an ending that was so terrible I feel personally snubbed. C'mon, what happened? Would a sequel or epilogue kill anyone? It left a very sour taste in my mouth after a very lovely and passionate book. Until the last 10 pages."
2,I was torn between 2 and 3 stars,"Seemed to start out fine, however you knew from the very beginning that those miscarriages were not natural. You just knew that they were caused by an outside force. Yet the H/h couldn't seem to put that together!Couldn't understand why H would be so mad at her for moving on. He sat her aside and went on to marry another but he expected her to stand by and wait and yes, even watch him with his new wife. Did he not think she had any pride and would just accept that? Of course she only married her husband because he saved her life and to remove her from her ex-husband's orbit, possible even place her out of his reach.Oh yeah and I have to agree that the ending was a bit quick and things were not explained. Are we to just draw our own conclusions? If so then why bother reading the book, we could have just drawn our own conclusions from the synopsis."
3,"Great plot, but too many grammar errors and abrupt end","This author may be unknown and underrated but her plot is really ingenious though it needs a lot of editing to make sense in some places, and the end was wrapped suddenly leaving a lot of questions on the air. A lot of unnecessary descriptions about the balls, wasting page after page that could have been used to write a better ending.But it gave me faith to read the works from a lot of unknown authors. Lisa Kleypas may be good in her works but sometimes her plots are overrated and inspired by other old literature like Wuthering Heights, The Buccaneers, etc. Some new authors have even better ideas about new plots but it is common for many to ""steal""other peoples idea. The other book that I read was ""Vanessa""which is almost a copy of this book, with names changed. I don't know which one is the original book, many authors copy other peoples's ideas.This book is a great read, but it could be better if re-edited."
1,It's like watching a train wreck...,"Romance?The ""hero"" is a psychopath, who believes that he is the center of the universe. If someone gets between him and what (or who) he wants, he has the right to crush him like a bug.The heroine is a doormat who believes that the hero is the center of the universe. (""I love him! I love him! Forget my husband and child! I love him!"") How nice of her husband to conveniently die, so that she and the ""hero"" can be happy together!The only comfort I got was the knowledge that once these two were together, at least they couldn't make anyone else miserable. (Except for their children, who have to live with these nuts.)"
1,"Perfect if you need hot water to make tea, maybe...","This product shoots scalding water from the steamer nozzle, not steam. Oh, it worked once or twice (and if you have three or four arms using it would be as easy as you'd anticipated).On the third and subsequent uses, all I get is hot water jetting all over the pants I'm trying to steam/iron. Of course I followed all the instructions (I am an engineer) and have tried a number of different things to see what the problem is. Problem is, the product is just cheap. Support consists of ""mail it to us plus $10 and we'll fix it"". So besides the $80 it costs, I'd be out another $30 in postage. Great. Reconsider your purchase. Ironing really isn't that much slower than trying to use this."
1,false title,this is the ohio state edition that is not mentioned in the title but mentioned in the middle of the description. no picture should have been a red flag. should have known $0.12 for a college text book was too good to be true. returned.
4,Loves it!,"My hubby loves this game! With that said, if you have a DELL computer it is extremely difficult to install the game. I ended up having to do a google search and found on the customer support website (info is on the installation instructions) that you have to do a right click from my computer, save it to your desktop, and then install. Otherwise the game works great!!"
5,Son Loves the Game,"My son (age 18) loves farming games and the entire farming scenario. After trying this game as someone else's home, he just had to have it. Amazon had the best price and the game was in excellent condition. Thanks!"
1,NOT what I expected,"I was expecting something like John Deere Drive Green. This game is little tiny tractors and implements that you really don't drive. You just direct the tractor/implement to the farm and watch it do it's thing. Very boring, not at all what I expected from the description. I wasted my money on this one.The seller, however, did a good job getting the product out to me - just in time for Christmas. Too bad the game sucked...."
3,John Deere American Farmer with John Deere Builder Bundle,"This game was a gift for my son in law. I never played it, but he seems to enjoy the game."
2,Plantronics DSP 500 vs Logitech 250,"I tried both and I lean towards the Logitech 250. Here's why:1. Logitech 250 comes with comfy leather-like covered foamy ear cups. For my taste it's more comfortable for all-day wear and isolates you from outside noise better than Plantronics'.2. Logitech 250 is cheaper than Plantronics. This is probably because of the huge honking 'DSP' box on the USB line on the Plantronics model. My computers have satisfactory sound capabilities, so I didn't need the 'DSP'.3. Logiech 250 is less bulky."
2,"A waste of money, even at this low price","After reading all revies here, I thought the pros outweighed the cons... My, how misled I was.Somebody should have warned me about the very unnatural sound, the annoying shrill quality of the high range, and the poor, terribly AWFUL, almost inexistent channel separation on this headset.I bought them as a replacement for my modest Logitech USB 200, not because they did not do their service, but because I accidentally broke them. But how much better they sounded, specially in the channel separation department.Now I am trying the Sennheiser PC135 (my first option, although a little bit more expensive) and, if I find them wanting, I think I am going back to the supposedly inferior Logitech 250 or 350."
3,Mic will not work,"I love everything about them, but I am in Iraq and use a computer phone to call home, I ordered these hoping they would help Everything works great but the microphone. I cannot get it to work with the Call Serve Phone. So they are a $55.00 set of head phones that I do not need. I have down loaded from Plantronics, even the test with the phone for audio works on the phone but no one can hear me. It worked one time, really good so it might be something besides them. But that does not help me."
3,Didn't work right for me,"Tried to get it to work, even talked with Plantronics tech support which tried to help. Couldn't get the microphone loud enough. The volume control for the microphone was greyed out and the one in the software kept going down to medium, even though I would try and turn it up."
3,"Great Quality, Poor stability","I purchased this headset mainly for the game of counter-strike. Although I found it fine for music and other things, there was a major problem i kept encountering with the headset. At random times when my computer would be on, it would freeze my computer, forcing me to manually restart. When my computer doesnt freeze, the headsets work like a charm. I contacted tech support, they couldnt help. I only think that it is b/c of my computer, and not being as up to date as the headset. So a word to the wise....dont plan to use this head set on a crappy computer...im running with windows xp pro, at 700 mhz, and having multiple problems.."
4,Good sound quality; poor head fit,"I am very impressed by the sound quality of this device when used with skype. The build quality is also high.Unfortunately it is not large enough and does not fit my head well. If you are concerned that you have low set ears, or a particularly large brain then you should try this device before you buy."
4,"Good sound, decent comfort",These headphones were easy to install and have worked flawlessly so far. The sound quality is very good. The comfort level of the headphones is decent but not outstanding.
2,Bad hum,There is a hum on the line when I use this headset for VOIP. The charge backs under Amazon's new return program don't make it worth returning. Best advice is just don't buy this one in the first place.
3,Gaming head phones,"I had a great time using these, the only problem was the hard piece of plastic they have half way down the cord, it kept getting in the way. Other then that they are a great headset"
4,Good value,"I am fairly happy with my experience with this headset. I think it's a good value for the money. I pretty much agree with the previous reviewer, chrisf911, on the upside/downside of this set. If I had to go back in time and buy a headset, I'd be happy to buy this set again.Disclaimer: I have not used other high quality headsets to make an informed comparison, nor have I tested this set with all varieties of activity. I have used to for mp3 listening and game sounds; and have found its performance adequate in both cases."
5,Audio imput to a Pwr Mac G5,"This item is a five star choice for me as I have tried several Mic's to imput voice overin imovie and iDVD, in fact any recording venue. Prior to receiving this headset and micI could not achieve consistent quality while recording. Being a home user I look for the bestquality at the most reasonable price."
4,Great Gaming Headset,I use this headset for World of Warcraft via Ventrilo.It has great clarity and volume in the mic with absolutely no distortion. I have heard my own voice in recorded gaming sessions and mine is the most clear (and the least annoying).The only reason I would not give this headset the full 5 is that it has a big module thing on the cord that constantly gets in the way. So maybe 4.5 if I could.
4,not perfect but really good,"I'm overly critical of sound quality. At home i have the Tritton surround sound headset running off optical connection. this doesnt' compare to that but the Tritton is $99 too.For the $ this is really nice. Sound, microphone and wire quality are all good. Controls are easy to use and the software is easy to use too. They're also fairly comfortable. Good headset for work."
4,Not a bad headset for the price....,"After purchasing the DSP-500 from Amazon.com (which saved me LOTS of money!), I installed on my XP system. I had to visit Plantronics website to try to get my speakers to work again. Like other users have said, switching between headset and pc speakers are a pain! Not like the external switch I've been use to. Tech support was friendly, but pretty much useless."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this because a prior reviewer said that it made a huge difference in his voice recognition program. In mine, it has made none. I have the same poor recognition I had with the free mike that came with the program. The only thing worse than getting hammered for close to [a lot of money]for this was the poor treatment I received from the Amazon.com seller..."
3,not for Gamers,I bought these for onlinr gameing and although they were great for listening to music useing them for gaming was terrible. I couldnt get counter strike to work with them and after getting help from plantronics they even said sorry we cant help you.
1,No serial number?,"I have this DSP headset. It work well at the beginning but after about 4 months, the right side speaker does not function, so the sound are only are from the left side. When I try to send it for the warranty repair, the support said that I need the proof of purchase, but I lost it.The headset doesn't even have the serial number, this make it very hard to claim the warranty."
1,Shipping date seems to be misleading,"I ordered the item on Feb 21. Ad says this particular item ""usually ships in 24 hours"". At checkout it estimates the ship date to be more than two months later (April 27)! If you can update the checkout screen, why can't you update the ad screen as well? Because it was such a hassle to get to the checkout page, I kept the order. No way to reach anyone to explain why it will take so long, or if it really will. I was mis-informed. If it really takes that long, I'll cancel my new card and shop elsewhere. If you told me on the first page, I wouldn't have a problem."
5,Excellent! Best sound quality ever - a no fail buy!,"Purchased this headset for Internet video conferencing and telephony (VOIP) purposes. The sound quality is exquisite -- both through microphone and headset. Crystal clear and no humming or any other intrusive or distracting sounds.While I personally find all headsets to be more or less uncomfortable, this one I can deal with quite well.You will not have any regrets."
1,I'd like to say this was a great product..but I can't..,"It worked for a few months before one day it started to smoke. The DSP housing literally started to melt and bend and smoke, I unplugged it from my computer in a rush.. My office smelled like an electrical fire had taken place.I've been trying to get in touch with Plantronics now for over two weeks and no one contacts me back. Thanks service.So now I have a rather expensive headset piece that has no functionality anymore and the home company won't replace. I didn't cause this, and it could have started a fire if I had not been witness to it.Be wary fellow purchaser,-ac"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this product July 5, 2002. I cannot download the Windows XP driver necessary from the Plantronics site. Sent 3-5 emails to the tech support and get little or no response."
1,"should say PC gaming, because they are useless for PS2","Advertised as gaming and the Playstation 2 has a USB port that allows other headsets to function fine. When I tried to use these I found out they do not work. Contacted Plantronics and got a plain and dirty response back that they are not compatible - that's it. No sorry, explanation of any options. DO NOT RECOMMEND."
5,lots of head banging to music and still working after 3 years,"The review title says it all! Great Product!!!! This product is not designed to be portable. Keep it at home for excellent sound quality of music, video games, and movies."
4,good product,"I purchased these for use with my computer and they worked fine. Had them for talking over the enternet with other people never had any problems,good purchase."
4,Yummy fruit & nothing more,"I am a fan of Earth's Best baby foods. There aren't any hidden ingredients, so it's a smart choice. As with other flavors, Apples & Apricots simply tastes good. (I try everything before I give it to my 10 month old.) The flavor can be a little tart, though, which is why I give the product 4 and not 5 stars. If my son doesn't want much of it on its own, I add it to his oatmeal the next morning, or I give him some after he has vegetables."
3,pretty good,Its hard to believe after hearing Tairrie B with My Ruin that she was once a rapper on Eazy-E's Ruthless Records. This band s pretty good. She does alot better at this then gangsta rap :)~
1,Terrible,"This band and this album is absolutley terrible, i dont know what i was thinking .... asides from a terrible singer .... and c'mon its a girl, they cant even play synchronized live.F-"
5,A great mix,"I bought this disc on the strength of Terror & her cover of Tainted Love but found so much more. From heavy hitting songs ""Sycophant'"", ""Preacher"" and ""Sick With It"" (Kittie fans should check this disc out for sure) to the slower moody songs, ""june 10th"" and ""Close Your Eyes"" This disc has atmosphere and rage and works because of the mix in styles and speed throughout."
5,my ruin's best album,"i love every song on here... its a little bit more industrial sounding than a p.u.p of v.a. or horror of beauty...but i think it sounds better that waybest best songs terror .preacher .blasphemous girl .absolution .cosmtetic .sycophant .beautiful flower .June 10th....as you can see there are a lot of really good songs on herethe only song i didn't really like was horrible pain (within my heart)..and prolouge .epiloge .beware of god arent really songs, just little spoken tracksthe only draw back is that masochrist and fever sound like they are far away and you need to turn up you stereo to hear them...which isnt all that bad, you should turn up your stereo as much as you can!this is one of my favorite cds and definetly worth the money...plus its got some really good pictures of terrie b. in there"
3,Unrealized potential,"What an opportunity lost. One of the the premier museums in the world and we receive what might have been passable on VHS but certainly not what we have come to expect on DVD. ""Masterpieces of the Hermitage"" is a better alternative to this DVD and at the same price. They are not the same even though they may be speaking about the same works of art. The technology of DVD lends itself so well to graphics arts presentation. Please utilize what is available to the max."
2,Low quality video and sound,"The quality of video and sound of this DVD set is low like of its VHS original of 1992. A much better is another, newer set, titled Hermitage Masterpieces, of 2004, which was remasterd."
1,A train wreck,"Sometimes mixing two good things results in a big mess. Imagine mixing pizza and beer- in a blender. I love No Doubt. I could go on for hours analyzing Return of Saturn especially. I also love string quartets-- in fact instrumental and classical music of many kinds. My first love in music came from attending the Oregon Symphony as a child. But No Doubt's songs done in strings sounds stilted, forced, and bluntly ridiculous. Sorry Gwen."
2,Ha ha! Surely it's a joke! What? It isn't?!,"When I listened to these clips, I cracked up. This is so bad it's funny, kind of like reality TV. If you want a laugh, try this CD. If you want music, I suggest you buy a REAL No Doubt album. No offense if you like chamber music; but these people who did this pathetically bad album have ruined it forever."
2,hum...,"some of the songs are alright, don't speak and simple kind of life aRE incredible. hella good and hey baby were a bad choice i think cos they are a bit repetitive when done on a string instument. im a little confused about vague moment..is that a no doubt song?"
5,It`s not No Doubt but it`s still good,"This is not a No Doubt CD. I am a big No Doubt fan and I liked this CD as well, it`s basically classical versions for No Doubt`s songs. It`s totally different from the sound of No Doubt but it`s good, it depends on your taste. I also recomendThe String Quartet Tribute to No Doubt: The Singles 1992-2003andThe String Quartet Tribute to Gwen Stefani."
3,Not For Fans of Lamb Of God,"Do you like No Doubt? Ever wonder what it would sound like without a girl singer who's trying to hard? You do? Well that's great. Ever wonder what it would sound like with a violin and a cello? No? Well then what are you doing here on this page! Sorry... you're curiousity probably peeked you.Well this CD is good. Alot of No Doubt songs are done extremely well here! In Fact, I'd venture to say it's in the top 10 String Quartet Tribute Albums of all time! I love the Hey Baby Version on this CD, and so will all of you.You a FAN of No Doubt? Then Buy this album. You LIKE No Doubt? Buy this album, it may broaden your horizons. HATE NO DOUBT? Then why are you even here? Go find a string quartet tribute to someone you like, silly goose!"
2,"Not so much a ""Girl Scout Songbook"" as ""learn to play the rcorder""","Wasn't pleased at all. If you are teaching your troop to play the recorder, it's fine, but just for playing familiar GS songs around the campfire, it's a bust. This was not at all what I thought it would be."
3,quick shipping,"Quick shipping over a holiday weekend and the product seems to be made of high quality material. Looks good so far, but haven't used them during a cut yet."
4,It's about time!,"This DVD has been available in Europe for quite some time. Nice transfer. Good, clean family fun (although one scene does depict a convention of prostitutes). Keep your eyes peeled for ""L'emmerdeur,"" released as ""A Pain in the Ass"" on VHS in the US. It's an even better showcase of Jacques Brel and Lino Ventura. I don't think it's on DVD even in Europe, though."
4,L'Aventure C'est L'Aventure,"I recommend this film to everyone who like humor. I watched them first time when I was 17. Now 37 years after, it is still fresh."
5,A trip into the past,"What a wonderful book: adventure, humor, nostalgia, travel, camaraderie. Leigh Fermor is a graceful writer who re-creates a time before the destruction of the world: 1933-34 in Europe: wooden shoes and windmills and woodcutters without chain saws or trucks.This is a book to savor: enjoy the trip."
4,enjoyable travel story in pre WWII years,a young social misfit sets out to walk from holland to constantinople and meets many fine people along the way. filled with wonderful images
5,gift for nephew!,This is a gift for a nephew who has been traveling alone last few months and sending great emails home. I love the book and will let you know how the gift was received after Christmas.
2,More history than travel,"The book is more a view of pre-WW II European life, and it was very interesting. I had assumed it would be more a travel book. Beware, the conversion to Kindle ebook didn't go well. The font size is a mess."
4,Person Below Obviously Hasn't Read It...,"Or she would recognize the documentation contained therein which proves the assertions.Men are battered to the tune of 30 - 40 percent of victims and murdered at a fair clip as well, yet 100% of the 5 billion dollars in funding in this country is for women. Not to mention the Duluth Model which forces police departments to persecute and arrest male victims of domestic violence as opposed to their battering spouses.It's time male victims were not only recognized but had some help and options available to them; if not it is at least time the sexist, man-hating laws which discriminate CLEARLY against men were rescinded and sent back into the dark ages where they belong."
3,Got a Question,"Are any of the men reviewing this book or the author of the book victims of DV? Haven't read it, but I was wondering. If that is the case, you have my attention."
1,Major Distortion of Domestic Violence,"As a straight, white, heterosexual male from a red state, but who also works with Domestic Violence victims, I can assure you that Mr. James is well off the mark with this book. Though it would be nice if the stats were skewed and men were truly less responsible for violence in the household, it is simple not the case. This book is irresponsible scholarship, and a prime example of the type of prejudice that exists against the DV movement as a whole. It is no longer a ""feminist"" issue, but rather a ""family"" issue. Domestic Violence is a serious matter, that deserves serious scholarship, and this book does not meet that standard."
4,Used this in high school,"This was my Latin book in high school for the second half of year 2 and year 3. I have very fond memories of the class (my first foreign language class), and learned quite a bit about grammar. I still remember some of the lessons.The book is good. It is not always clear, and tries to explain things on the level of a high-school student. There are times that a linguistic explanation would be much simpler, but it's a school text book.The second book seems a bit more rushed than the first. Much more grammatical ""nitty-gritty"" is in the second book. I think the author assumes a level of familiarity after one works through the first book, and picks up the pace a bit. Sometimes this leaves things a bit ""less than excellently"" described. However, overall, I think the book did a good job. I was very happy to find the series so I could start re-learning Latin (eventually...)."
4,great memories of this book,"This was my textbook in second-year Latin before going on to read Caesar, Horace, Cicero, Virgil, and Catullus in subsequent years. I liked the book so much that I bought it as an adult just to keep my Latin fresh. It was wonderful reliving the adventures of Publius and Furianus, the text's two primary protagonists (who, at the risk of being crass, my high school pals and I fondly referred to as 'Pubes and Furry-anus', hey, we were 14...). I have found that the book is an excellent primer for reading Latin primary sources as well as a great reference manual for some of the odder and more difficult Latin grammatical constructions (e.g. counterfactual conditionals). I used a different text when I took Latin again in college, and this book was clearly superior to that one."
1,Latin for Americans 2nd Book,"I am a sophomore in highschool and am learning Latin from this book. Let me just tell you, THERE MUST BE AN EASIER WAY TO LEARN LATIN!! I took Spanish for two years and thought it was boring, so I thought I'd take a more challenging class, well lets call it bitter sweet justice because this is unbelievably hard. Right now I'm trying to translate the part about the Gaulic wars, and that is honestly the most confusing, gramatically incorrect, and boring piece of work I've ever tried to read, much less translate. So I recomend you look for an easier book."
3,The 4th Floor (1999),"Chilling tale about a woman who moves into an old apartment to live alone and finds that one of her new neighbours has a ""small"" grudge against her and begins tormenting her and eventually tries to kill her. Juliette Lewis does a nice job, and Shelley Duvall steals the show with her over-the-top performance as the apartment house owner, Martha Stewart. Unfortunately, this thriller wasn't as good as I had hoped, although it was quite entertaining and suspenseful. William Hurt's talent goes to waste here, but he does a decent job for what he's given. I liked this alot, but I wouldn't say it's excellent."
2,An average thriller,"A good movie, good direction, good acting but the end is just a bit too weak. A lot of scenes will remind you masterpieces such as Rosemary's baby and Rear Window. Impossible not to think about them. Anyway, the end could have been 10 000 times creepier. A pity ! Finally the lack of several individuals make easy to guess who the bad guy is.I would have loved to see more of the tenants and if possible created by David Lynch ;o)"
4,Loved It...,"Personally, I found this movie to be quite engaging. It had been awhile since I actually sat down and watched a movie but this one came on the other night on HBO and I was glued to my screen. I thought the movie was full of suspense and at times humor. I admit it's not the greatest film in the world but it's worth checking out."
1,Just Atrocious,"This movie was a 90 minute foot cramp. The inane plot, which attempts to appear both complicated and esoteric through use of classical references ends up being a complete and utterly predictable mess. None of the characters are given any life by either the script or the actors. The guiltiest of the lot is Juliette Lewis. Barely able to keep up with other actors as a co-star (see Natural Born Killers) she simply fails as a leading lady. The only enjoyment you may get from this film is of the ""so bad it's good variety"". But, even as far as unintentional humor goes, this film isn't all that inspiring. The movie, and Ms. Lewis in paticular, grate at the senses and insult the intelligence. Strongest recommendation to avoid. One day, mayhaps I'll stop being diplomatic and tell you how I really feel, but until then treat this film like a mugger with ebola and run far far away."
2,Very Bad,"this is not the best petra's compilation. Petra praise 1 it's much better, and this album almost have only the petra praise's 2 songs... so isn't good."
1,Do NOT buy.,Amazingly disappointing sound quality. At first I thought I overheard a TV documentary film on Billie Holiday. All songs sound like ones from 50s radio programs. I do not understand why the production studio did not remove the noise. This CD does not deserve even a penny.
5,Excellent!,"I recommend this book to anyone of all ages. This book was a bit of surprise to me because I've a few books by Albert P. Terhune that are the exact same type; a collie saving a person from a pond, saving a sick child, etc. But this story was actually in a chapter book format, rather than a compilation of short stories. The book as a whole was heartwarming and memorable, and I'm very pleased that I have this book. It just brings the reader even closer to Terhune's collies and the breed in general"
5,Love dogs? Read This,"Another one of Terhune's collie stories. This novel tells the story of Bruce from Ugly Duckling to heroic war dog. It is rather amazing reading older books to see what cultural thoughts make thier way into the novel. If you are a German, you might want to skip this one, for Terhune was writing either during WW I or just after and there are some anti-German passages.This book is more in the tradition of Wolf, though the ending is far different. It is an exciting and quick read."
1,Poor quality,I brought one of these for each of my parents. They both worked for a few months then stopped working. Save your money and buy higher quality some other place.
2,Looked cool for 2 weeks.,I really loved the look of my yellow headlights but one bulb burnt out on a night drive after just having them for 2 weeks. Maybe it was a fluke that the bulb died so fast but I'm not going to order anymore. I should have went with a more known brand.
2,Directionless.,"Think Discipline era King Crimson without guitars but with keyboards instead. Still there is another essential difference between the two. V.S.'s compositional skills are sorely lacking. There is little sense of melody within any of the tracks. There is also a sameness in structure and sound that after a while sounds monotonous and fails to hold one's interest. The keyboardist, bassist and drummer all have their strengths but as the songs lack direction they just never really go anywhere. The vocalist would be an aquired taste, if at all. Pass on this outfit and go instead to another Swedish band, The Flower Kings....Simon"
2,Nice in the picture ...,"We got this case as a lightweight alternative to a bulky, hard-sided trumpet case. After only 4 days of use, the nylon was pulling out of the seam with the zipper and trim, with the tear growing measurably each day. Gator claims to stand by their product, so we've sent the case back to them for either a replacement or refund. Also, the trumpet really did not fit into this case all that well. We're going back to the original case."
5,Essential Reference,"Pretty much essential reference if you're working with MySQL and want to do things fast. A lot easier than reading reference docs online. Typeface is easy to read, layout is good. It has become probably the most used of my 40 or so computer books and is now dog-ear'ed to pieces and I have never even read it!"
3,not good for window,"i am indonesian & my english is now well, i had read this book finish 2 months ago, i had never known about db, but from this book i got enlightenment with what is sql language, and solve currently encounter problem, why i give this book 3 stars, cause is not so good for window, most syntax are for unix, e.g. %.after finish it mysql give me a chance to learn oracle giant db for future use, i hope not to learn open-source program again in future coming, not including perl,php."
3,not good for window,"i am already finish this book 2 months ago, and if give me enlightment about the sql language, i thought after reading this book i don't need to learn other db,because my real focus is learning programmer language java & perlthis book give me frustration, i need to open the online doc. for looking window using like ""load local infile blah.txt into table blah"" is not suit for window,i think i need to change mysql to oracle for window using, but mr. paul is done good job for his books anyway.keep up mr paul"
3,"RE: Best technical book ever written!, July 4, 2002",I've seen enough of these comments to believe this is actually author's comments.
1,Don't waste your time...,"I was extremely dissapointed to say the least. This book doesn't even begin to cover video game programming in mySQL, not even the basics. In fact, it doesn't cover video game programming at all. The section on compiling for DOS must have been lost on the way to the printing press... While the plot had substance to it, the ending was predictable and unoriginal..."
5,Hands Down the Best.,"I shopped long and hard before finally [got] MySQL by Paul DuBois. I considered several others before finally settling on this one, and I am happy to say that I made the right decision."
4,"Do you use MySQL? If so, this is the printed reference","Yes, this book is getting aged (this is the reason I gave four rather than five stars). The wonderful MySQL people keep their documentation on the web very up-to-date, but sometimes you want a printed reference. This is it. At work, we have MySQL books that are more recent, but they are not as comprehensive. My boss once referred to the book as my ""bible"" when I told someone off the ""top of my head"" the page number that would answer their question. That's the power of this book, it is very well organized and get's to the point so that you can use MySQL quickly, regardless of your background. If you have this book, along with a book that is related to MySQL and how you plan to use it (eg., with PHP) and the MySQL website, then you are set!"
5,Great MySQL reference with quality tutorials/examples,"This book answers a lot of questions left out by other MySQL books. If you are new at this, take the time and download the samp. databases and work through the examples. The PHP section is also very informative and helpful.MySQL + PHP + Apache + Linux = a combination that is very hard to beat! Learn it, love it, live it."
4,The Light Barrier,"This is a thought-provoking book. The subject is a complicated phenominon that should be examined by peer review in similar, less anecdotal evidence. As a graduate engineer and a long-time photographer, I am aware of some of the properties of light itself as perceived by humans, and view this subject with considerable interest. One of my grandchildren has benefited substantially from Irlen prescribed glasses. Thus,I look forward to future examination of this phenominon."
1,The Light Barrier,"This book tells of the problems that children and adults are having and the difficult time they have finding a solution to the problem. The world want to put the everyone on drugs with all the side effects, without realizing there is a non-invasive way of dealing and eliminating the problem. Rhonda Stone does an incredible job writing about her own experiences with her kids and the ordeals they had to go through to finally find a solution.I too have Irlen Syndrome and boy has the technology helped me.Great job Rhonda."
1,Blew out on the first day I put it in,dont buy this (POS) sub you get what you pay for I guess... It blew out on the first day I put it in and I cant return it back to amazon for some reason... do not buy your just eating $25
4,Nice!,I was actually a bit surprised at the quality of these items as they were on the lower end of the price spectrum. I'm very pleased with them so far.
5,Great basic replacement subwoofer,"I used this to replace the 8 inch subwoofer from a 2003 toyota avalon xle with the JBL speaker package. The JBL's all blew out within a couple years, and this was a perfect fit as a replacement. Sounds great, cheap, and worked with just a few simple modifications to the hole pattern already drilled in it. Overall, for the price, unbeatable. And if you are replacing the JBL subwoofer in an avalon, the ohm rating on it is something like 3.7, this being a 4 is essentially a perfect match."
3,It's ok,"Well it looks nice and the magnet is big for a 8 inch. it sounds ok too, but it don't satisfied you that much. For the price it's worth it. But if you want something that the bass will make you feel Oooh yea this is it then get a little bit more expensive one. I give it a 3 star because the bass can't handle a lot, instead of BOOM BOOM some time it goes Plaaa Plaaa.. hehehe...."
3,You Get what you pay for,"I was looking for something budget minded, this was the low end of the budget. Hooked them up and not much bass at all. Have them in a set of tower speakers. Dissappointed but I should have known better!!"
5,Good punch and sound reproduction,"Obviously not a pro woofer, but for a basic sub it is more than enough in terms of punch. I like to hear all of the base lines in music, so two of these in my Ford Focus hooked to a 250 watt amp is plenty. Pretty good sound quality, and can shake you pretty well if you want. Not 10's or 12's by any means, but if you have a smaller vehicle, these are perfect, especially for the price."
4,Excellent Documentary on Eric Campbell,"""Chaplin's Goliath"" (1996) is a long-overdue documentary on actor Eric Campbell, who became the ideal comic heavy in Charlie Chaplin's 1916-17 Mutual two-reelers. The David and Goliath relationship between Charlie and Eric sparked a symbiotic rapport that evolved throughout the Mutual series. In addition to exploring Campbell's all-too-brief life and career, director Kevin Macdonald reflects upon the void in Chaplin's post-Mutual work. The loss of Campbell was immeasurable to Chaplin, who never again found a comic foil equal to Eric's talent and cinematic presence. One can only imagine Charlie and Eric (rather than Mack Swain) surviving the Klondike blizzard in ""The Gold Rush."" The valuable 52-minute film includes previously unseen Chaplin Mutual outtakes as well as failed screen tests for Campbell's replacement."
4,Good Thriller,"Xeno Soultion by Nelson Erlick reminded me of a classic Robin Cook thriller, with a dose of Michael Crichton for good measure. The topic in this rollercoaster is Xenotransplantation, whereby animal organs are used in humans. Cook covered similar ground in Chromosome 6. Chromosome 6 was excellent, but very predictable plot-wise. Xeno Soultion, however, is wholly unpredictable, and I have not read another author as ruthless. I would recommend it if you are looking for a thriller with a glimmer of intelligence."
4,Don't look for nice things to happen to good people,"This medical thriller draws on current scientific research to posit a plausible pandemic birthed by the profession that is supposed to refrain from harming us. Hard sci-fi blends with geo-commercial politics in a slam-skid terrifying thriller that will haunt you. Bad guys push at you from at all levels of power. There is a hero, gritty, falling apart, pulled together, and out to protect his family and the earth. It reads as though written for Michael Douglas. Spend six bucks, people, and clear out the next few evenings. Jan in Radnor Twp."
2,So-so book; I was a bit disappointed.,"While it certainly seemed well researched and had a lot of science included, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't much to the virus itself. It was more of a coverup for profit kind of story, and that wasn't what I was looking for. Oh well - I'll keep searching for the perfect blend of science, mystery and epidemic!"
5,The Xeno Solution,"Nelson Erlick is on the fast track to being recognized with the likes of Michael Chrichton with this latest book. The Xeno Solution has surpassed his previously released GermLine, which I also thouroughly enjoyed. Xeno Solution is a non-stop thriller from begining to end. The complex plot twists, and turns, and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. A must read for those that enjoy a medical thriller. Nicely done."
1,What a Disapointment,Cyrano would have certainly challenged everyone involved in this lamentable production had he seen it. Kevin Kline was robotic and Jennifer Garner was wooden. The sets were ugly and sparse and the directing aimless.See if you can find the French movie version. It is absolutely thrilling.
5,chiago-style blues piano playing with grace,"One of the finer examples of Perkins' ability to coax wonderful boogie stylings from the keyboard, this solo record is a true testament to his artistic craft. This is one of the finest blues releases of 2003 and should be in every blues collector's library."
5,review of Kenneth Osbeck Junior Choir Workbook,I am sorry that this book is so difficult to obtain--it is an outstanding workbook for teaching young singers to read music for the purpose of sight singing as opposed to teaching notereading to a piano student. Through Amazon I have been able to obtain used copies for my young voice students. I originally was introduced to the book while studing song leading and choral conducting in Bible college.
5,Kirkus is wrong!,"I took classes with Thomas Reeves while an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin. I know Thomas Reeves. Kirkus, obviously, does not. Nowhere in this splendid read have I found the zealot that Kirkus makes him out to be! Are we reading the same text?Reeves takes us on a ""brief"" trip through 20th century America, providing short, useful bibliographies for more in depth analysis at the end of each chapter. His writing is sharp and easily digestible. And, given that this is written by an elder historian at the height of his craft, it is a welcome relief to not be stopped every five minutes by a footnote, a sign that tells us the author knows his subject matter.Like stepping in the classroom all over again . . . and loving it!"
3,it was good for what i needed it for,"i needed the book for a project and it really helped me for that particular reason. the content was full of interesting and helpful facts pertaining to the history of the united states. i was looking for a book of this exact format, one that was not too long but still held all the important information i sought out. i was looking for a book that would still leave me time for everything else in my busy schedule, yet still provide me with all the great info. i am definatly not a college student, which is for whom the book was made. but i found that it still helped me out quite a bit. so if u have a project or if you just plain are interested in learning the history of your country, i would reccomend this book. Reeves is a great author for a younger people as well."
5,"Now, no need to shuffle things around to dust.","I don't like having dust on book shelves or on the tops of the books. Yet, I stongly dislike having to remove the books to dust them and the shelves. This product is the perfect solution for this problem. It easily squiggles into tight spots. The soft fibers wisk the dust away without any damage to the books. I'm so glad I found this product."
2,Not that great,"I bought this to dust my walls. Since I have 10' ceilings, the telescoping handle seemed a good selling point. However, when I opened the box, the dusting fiber end was mashed down, exposing the metal rod that runs through the center of it. The tip of this duster will now scratch surfaces and paint, and I can't get the thing to fluff up enough to cover it. Oh well, the handle is nice."
2,Disappointed,"I have to admit, I am quite disappointed with this Quickie Static Duster. The brush is SO lacking fibers, much unlike the thick, plush brush I purchased over 5 year's ago and am still using. No wonder the price was so reasonable. The only redeeming quality of this item is its telescoping handle.Quickie Home-Pro Flexible Static Duster"
2,Inferior product,"Quickie makes a more robust static duster then this particular one. The duster section is thin, so thin that that metal head of the duster is exposed and could scratch possible surfaces. Also, this product is sold and branded as a Quickie product but when it arrives it is the store brand Meijer packaging. Very disappointed."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I'd had a similar product of this brand and type from years ago that broke. This replacement is not as good. The handle should extend further than it does, and the duster head itself should be fuller and thicker. It's also no great bargain considering its quality. I would rather have spent a few more $ and got something better. I do like the free shipping, when I can find it, and not having to pay sales tax which is a saving, but that's going away -- unfortunately."
1,Frustrating,"This DVD is frustrating. The ""Sexy Slim Down"" segment claims to be ""easy-to-learn"", but I found myself rewinding multiple times, and still not getting the steps right. I finally gave up. :(The ""Dancer's Abs"" segment was equally frustrating. I haven't tried the ""High Engergy Fat Burner"" because I'm scared.The tone and sculpt segments are ok. The toning band is fairly straight forward. But in contrast to the other 2 segments I tried, I didn't feel like these two segments were that intense of a workout."
5,10 minute Dance Video,"Even after 10 minutes, I feel the stretch in my muscles and I really like the host of the video."
4,"Good product, but not for the intended use...","Don't see any improvements with wrinkles. But it's a great skin moisturizer, and simply the best when used after shaving. Prevents razor burns in any shaving area.Recommend."
5,These boots kick butt!,"The color of these boots are true to the picture. The suede is superior quality. I am usually a bargain basement shopper, but the price I paid for these boots is well worth it."
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"This is one of the best books you will ever read about World War Two. The story starts with a girl named Kay. She has many difficulties with her step-mother ""Amazing Grace"". Amazing Grace has to do with most of the plot"
1,"Over priced , over rated","I am a heavy use home owner and the Dewalt 987 is not up to the task. In less than a year, the motor smoked twice with the distinct smell of burnt motor winding, but it continued to run. Finally, after the warranty expired the transmission had catastrophic failure. The Craftsman that this Dewalt drill replaced lasted longer and was a superior drill. I retired the Craftsman because the chuck was a POS and the batteries had a short life. Overall, I have to rate the Dewalt 987 as light duty and maybe OK for occasional home owner use. I will be looking toward Milwaukee & Makita for a replacement. I have many Milwaukee corded tools and am satisfied with their durability."
1,Another Chinese Black and Decker Product,"This thing is just a yellow Black and Decker drill from China. It's amazing how people line up to pay extra for the yellow paint and then excuse major faults like the sloppy battery connection and poorly designed chuck that locks up. I fell for the marketing hype myself and smoked the drill in less than a year. I'm a heavy user homeowner. Since I smoked the DeWalt, I learned that it is owned by Black and Decker. I learned that the difference between the products is the marketing budget and Nascar sponsorship. I then smoked two Milwaukees. Now I am looking at a Panasonic to replace my third Milwaukee. The Milwaukee is better than the DeWalt by far, but it's still not up to my expectations. The Panasonic for the same money used NiMH batteries and has 3.5 amp hour batteries. No battery memory and much more power. Plus the Panasonic is built in Japan."
5,hold your breath thriller,"this story will capture you and hold you tightly.you feel like you have been sucked into their world and cannot get out of it.the story is alive and joyce ann hogue grabs you with her writing and you feel her words tighten around your throat.you want to grab and shake the characters. yell..hey! look!!!behind you !!!! you will not only live in this story, but willwant to read it over and over, and sit breathlessly waiting forthe sequel. you will look over your shoulder thinking you hearkat...or is that hansome sweet talking man richard?an exstremely exciting story......heart pounding, captivating,page turner. you will find your self hurring thru yourdaily chores you do to get back and see whats next, and be astonished at what does happen.i recomend this to anyone who loves a good psycological thriller. read this alone at your own risk...."
1,Rambling and anti-climactic,"I had high hopes for this book after reading such good reviews. I was severely disappointed by over 600 pages of rambling psycho-babble analyzing too many characters and plot lines. The first chapter is the most interesting and I kept reading for a long time hoping that it would get even more gripping. It didn't. By the end I was skimming through and could care less about the, like, 10th victim of the whole story. Do people really care about a part two? The other reviewers must be the writer's friends and family.The writer's style was promising, but unpolished. The premise was compelling but poorly executed."
5,What a Ride!!,"Joyce Ann Hogue has a unique knack of making her charaters 3 dimensional. Once you pick this book up it's nearly impossible to put it down. Try it. I dare you. But I warn you, you may want to leave the lights on."
4,on the path...,"Joyce Ann Hogue has taken a huge leap into the literary world. and, as style goes, on the eerie, fog laden literary path between Stephen King and Clive Barker, lay the no-mans land which has become the terror-tory of Joyce Ann Hogue... she creates a realty based world of the could be and blends it with a world that we are all afraid to enter, but once we do, we keep reading until we come to the end, hoping for a good, happy ending... to see if a happy ending is possible.. read this book."
4,Good ol Herbie,"His rhythym section get's plenty of solo time and they ain't too, shabby either! This is a great opportunity to see upclose the remarkable talents of drummer Billy Cobham and the equally magnificent (""THE MAN of the string bass"") Ron Carter. It's so good to watch Billy playing straight ahead jazz here with two of the truly greatest exponents of the art. Billy has switched his style to playing the ride cymbal with his left hand and if you think he has any problem swinging, think again!"
4,"Good quailty DVD, But...","This is technically a good quality DVD. I purchased it looking for something with Herbie playing some serious acoustic Jazz piano in trio style.For the most part I was satisfied. My only complaint was that there seems to be a bit too much drum and base soloing and not enough evocative piano work going on... but I guess thats the nature of the beast with Herbie... He seems to seldom get into a melodic groove in a live setting or atleast not enough for me. Ron and and the Drummer are indeed great musicians so there is great musicianship on this DVD ... Just not enough piano for me. Sound and Image quality are excellent.Oddly enough, the best part of the DVD (for me) was the Bonus track, where they play Herbie's Speak like a child, although a somewhat deconstructed version."
2,"Good bag, incorrect temperature rating","Just received this bag. it's very compact packed and super light.The only bad thing is the temperature rating of 37 F is incorrect.See what i have on my bag:comfort +51.8 Flimited comfort 46.4 Fextreme +23 FSure i didn't want a bag for extreme conditions!!!I'm gonna exchange it for lafuma 800g 22 degree (which is, I'm sure, also incorrect but must be much warmer)."
2,Very Victorian!,"This is a book of a Victorian flower garden,it has absolutely nothing to do with x-mas.Most of the designs are of roses and cherubic children, there are also some violets and butterflies and a couple of fairy flowers. The layout of the book is very good, the charts are in color and very well defined; but I personally found the designs too old- fashioned and I did not like the colors used in the patterns very much."
1,OK at first but then,I liked this lock at first but after a few uses the metal cylinders adjacent to the lock came loose and began sliding up down and around the cable during use. It was a real pain trying to keep the things from scratching my frame. Threw it in the trash.
3,I should have bought a Kryptonite,"When the cable is open, in order to plug the ends together the dials must be set to the combination. This is typical for locks of this type. However, the combination dials on this lock rotate far too easily.Thus, when locking the bike, any slight contact with something else moves the combination dials and then you can't insert the other end of the cable until you set the dials again.The same applies after unlocking the bike and you are recoiling the lock to stow it away. If anything slightly touches the dials, you have to set the combination dials again so that you can insert the other end of the cable.My old Kryptonite combination dials had more friction in them and this never happened."
1,I bought this cable for my bike and my bike is gone!,"I bought this cable for my new bike and now my new bike was gone. Someone just cut the cable and took the bike. It was very easy. Another man, whose bike was next to mine using a similar cable, his bike was also stolen. I called the manufacture and was told that kind of cable is just for look. They said that it was not suppressing to them my bike was gone. They said everyone knows that kind of cable can be cut off easily. I did not know that before. Now I learned it in a hard way with a cost."
1,cuttable,"my wife had her bike stolen in daytime at a busy spot. the thief cut through the cable, looks like with a hacksaw. this is not a good lock.also, if you check out the manufacturer's website, they have a guarantee (if you send in a slew of paperwork on purchase and then after you file your police report). However, this lock is not covered by the guarantee. Kind of strange they sell a lock they won't back up."
4,"Nice, strong, smoothe",Very sturdy. Easy to set combination. I look forward to years of bike security.
4,"Good, but very specific","This book was interesting to read and very informative. Do be aware that it is very specific for canoeing on Arctic rivers, and is much less applicable to warmer climes."
2,Good Case But Didn't Fit,Will not fit my phone for some reason... My phone is too thick for the case to snap together. I really like the case itself just wish it would've worked.......
2,Okay,"This particular item is poorly edited. Paragraphs are repeated over again. Lines begin and end poorly. It is as if someone just typed this up one night, sent it to the printery and put it up for sale and never once checked to see if there were no errors. While I am glad that I have this very important piece of history, the product itself is terrible and not worth the cost."
5,Power/grindcore classic!,"I feel this is Spazz's best release. Speed beyond speed, power through power. Buy the _Gummo_ soundtrack and check-out some of this excellent grind."
1,Still a Dad.,"Looking for advice on being a single dad from an authority or researcher or guy on the corner or psychologist or kindergarten teacher. Do not look here. I would like to just throw it away because it's so depressing (at least the first half). Going to give the second half a chance, though. In the mean time, if dog eats the book or it gets scribbled in, aliens take it or it falls in the toilet.....No big deal."
3,A beginner's guide to divorce,"The book leans heavily towards a father's view of divorce instead of a person's view of divorce. Feelings and emotions about divorce appear to be the same no matter what gender you are. This is not a book for women. I wouldn't recommend it for noncustodial mothers because I'm sure they would take offense to it. Little information is given to help the noncustodial parent adjust. It's mainly a book advising what can be expected, but I found the information to be rather outdated as more laws now lean towards joint custody which divides the child right down the middle."
1,a grossly one-sided and therefore false picture,"Having been a Scientologist for 25 years I can absolutely state that this book paints a very false picture of Scientology.For example, the Scientologists I know are anything but withdrawn from others or lacking in positive relationships, quite the reverse.I recommend reading actual Scientology materials to get the intent, flavor and usefulness of the subject."
3,Tis a silly movie but fun.,"IF you are looking for another ""War and Peace"" film stop right now. Olsen and Johnson are two show biz vaudeville guys that manage to get kicked out of their actors boarding house because of their musical seal act! Off they go looking for an old friend that runs a theater. Mistaken for millionaires, their new show runs strictly on speculation.Wise cracks fly and murder occurs with it all coming down to O&J; having to solve the mystery. The transfer is not the best but the film gives some insights as to comedy at the time, Still it's fun and light hearted."
1,Why so bitter?,"As a huge fan of Julia Cameron's works, I was thrilled to see she had a new book out. The beautiful cover, however, is the only inspiring thing about this work.What I believe was intended to be a fun, irreverent tone is severely marred by Ms. Cameron's unexplicable need to take blatent pot-shots at people working and practicing different types of spirituality. These nasty comments were unnecessary to her essays about her own spiritual quest, and she comes across rather like a playground bully who wants others to rally behind her and gang up on high-profile people who don't see things her way.Ms.Cameron is far too accomplished a writer to reduce her work to nasty drivel. I hope for a subsequent volume in which she speaks more from her heart and less from her ego."
1,"Why so bitter, Julia?",I agree with Tracy Becks - this book is so bitter (and also poorly written) that you have to wonder if Julia Cameron actually wrote it.Eric Winter
1,"More bitter than grandma's boiled greens (why, Ms. Cameron?)","I used to be a fan of Ms. Cameron, but this book really turned me off. Offering nothing useful or new, this book is one big rant against organized religion that gets downright hateful in spots. Really, Julia, do we need this? Is this what creativity is all about?Her prevous books show no indication of a future dive into this bitterness and bile, and it even makes one wonder if perhaps Ms. Cameron has fallen off the wagon (but that's hardly relevant). Please avoid this if you're even remotely a fan of ""The Artist's Way""; if you've just escaped from a cult, this might help you bring your rage to the surface."
2,"HA, HA, HA! Yeah, right!","The title of this book is ironic, since Ms. Cameron thinks God actually IS a laughing matter! Her opinion is that people tend to take their spirituality too seriously. Well, I agree that many people should lighten up. However, spirituality is a basically serious matter (although not devoid of joy, anything but!!). As an evangelical Christian, I regard spirituality as a matter of eternal consequence. And, make no mistake about it, her approach is not necessarily a Christian approach, although she throws Christ in there quite a bit. But everything else is thrown in the mix, too, as if it all had equal worth. That's not to say there are some potentially valuable exercises included in the book, and even some interesting opinions. But, ultimately, a self-constructed spirituality gathered from a hodge-podge of sources leads one only to the ""God"" of wishful thinking, not the one true God."
3,Worth Listening To,"Written for radio broadcast prior to WWII, The Company of Heaven is not one of Britten's major works. Nonetheless, it is worth listening to. Composed when he was still a young man, it is certainly not as original as later work but shows many of Britten's gifts. Britten's talents for lyrical writing, setting text to music, and theatrical effects are all displayed in this piece. Of greatest interest to Britten enthusiasts."
4,Good book to get when adopting a Greyhound,This book is very informational. I would reccomend it to anyone thinking about adopting a Greyhound!
4,A great insight into owning Racing Greyhounds,"I bought this book to help me decide whether I would be making the right choice in adopting a racing greyhound. I wasn't disappointed, this book did tell me a lot of the things I needed to know before making the decision final. I now know what to expect when I am ready to bring a racing greyhound into my house, my life, and my heart.The training methods in this book may work for some, but for me, it is a little vague. I'm fairly certain that the training method detailed in this book may work for some dogs, but for many others, it could achieve little to nothing. I advise researching other training methods after reading the one detailed, and making your own mind up. No two dogs are the same, and no two owners are the same, and ultimately, the choice of training method has to be based on the traits of both dog and owner.Well worth reading, especially for those inexperienced with dogs, and in particular greyhounds."
2,Get to the point please,"The first part of the book has some interesting historical and technical details about Greyhounds. But then it develops an annoying habit of telling you what it is going to tell you and how important it is for you to know, but when it eventually gets around to the actual info, it isn't much. You could say the same thing in one paragraph, not a whole chapter! I could not finish it. I read two others and highly reccomend ""Greyhounds: Everything About Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Behavior, and Training"""
3,Good book; helpful hints,"I found this book helpful before I received my adopted greyhound. It helped me be more prepared on what to expect when my greyhound came home. I thought there was too much emphasis on the training portion, although I did get a few ideas on what to do. The part about rewarding with a treat before and after meeting people has helped out a lot. I do recommend this book before you get your greyhound as well as reading other books so you'll know what to expect."
3,Fair to Middlin',"Although I enjoyed all of the Greyhound-specific information in this book, I have been around dogs my entire life and already know how to train one. There is a large section devoted to ""clicker"" training--something I wasn't interested in reading about when I purchased a Greyhound book. Furthermore, as someone who trained her first dog when I was 10 years old, I thought many of the things the author recommended training your retired racing dog were strange and pointless."
4,retired greyhounds are great,Retired greyhounds for dummies is very informational it is definately designed for novice dog owners. Enjoyed the book but if you have owned a dog a lot of the information will seem redundant.
4,A worthwhile investment,"This book can help you decide if adopting a retired racer would (or would not) be the right decision. If the answer is ""yes"", it will also help you make your dog's post-racing life the best it can be. After reading the book cover to cover, it left me with no unanswered questions.I have several other ""For Dummies"" books, and this one has a much less flippant tone than some of the others. Thankfully.Some of the material here is what one should expect in any good basic general dog care book, but there is plenty that is specific to the greyhound breed. For example, a section about the breed's unique dental concerns."
3,formulaic guide to adopting a dog,"I'm an owner of 2 retired racers, and this book was recently given to me. All the information in the book seems accurate, but it's a lackluster description of how to adopt a dog. Most greyhound owners are passionate about their dogs, and that isn't reflected here. I do think there's too much information on training. Greyhounds are smart, sensitive, and quick learners, and I found that a minimum of training was required. (I didn't adopt these dogs to have them perform for me - they did quite enough ""performing"" on the track - I wanted them as companions.) Aside from that, this is a good primer on the breed."
5,Thank you,I have 2 wonderful and loving rescued Greys and this book helped me figure a few things out early on. I would suggest it before you adopt a grey to understand what their breed is about. This book is highly recommended. Thank you. Great Transaction too. Quick shipping and a great price.
4,Greyt reference!,My wife and I have had the pleasue of adopting and fostering retired racers for the past 15 years. This book provides great information for new adopters and is a valuable reference for old hands. It's written in an easy to read and understand manner covering from thinking about adoption to saying goodbye to a faithful friend.
5,Retired Racing Greyhounds for Dummies,I found this book to have many helpful tidbits not usually found in material about raising a retired racer. Great read and very practical.
1,Hmmmm!,"We started reading this book prior to adopting a rescue greyhound because it was highly recommended. We found it stifling, overwhelming, and not an enjoyable read at all. We've read only half of it and will likely not pick it up again."
5,Extremely Practical and Easy to Read,"I recently adopted a Retired Racing Greyhound into my home. Although I have lived with a greyhound in the past, I had never adopted one from a young age (our new greyhound is 3 years old). This book provided extremely practical and helpful tips, background information on the breed, strategies for rewarding, and countless other pieces of helpful information. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone considering adopting a greyhound or even those of you who may already have a greyhound in your house. The book is full of SO much useful information in an easy-to-read format....you just can't go wrong!"
1,A Lemon,"I used it once and loved it. I went to use it three weeks later and it no longer worked. I tried a fresh battery, still no luck. Now I'm stuck with the effort and expense of trying to get the manufacturer to honor the 60 day warranty."
1,trimmer/shaver NOT hair remover,"It's not a hair remover! It's a small trimmer/shaver and good probably just for the eyebrows or very small thin hair, if that."
5,So much better then the the other one out there,"This is just better made. the last one I had was not the Norelco, and it just fell apart"
1,Please don't buy this headset,"The reception in this headset is so bad that i could't hear any thing other than the static noice. The tuning is ""analog"" so it's very difficult to tune the station you need. The headset also does't fit properly . Every day when i wear it i think i should return it immediately ."
1,What a piece of junk.,No reception. Tried the customer service # twice. No response. Emailed tech support. No response. I can see why. Threw the radio in the trash.
2,Mediocre sensitivity and sound quality,"The sound quality of this product is not good. Reception fades in and out, except for the very strong stations, when wearing this while walking around."
1,useless,"The reception is so bad as to make this radio useless. As bad as thoses small shirt-pocket, ear-bud radios that are frequently given away as promotions (and barely work). Uncomfortable and possibly dangerous ear piece placement design."
1,Worthless unless you want a toy or a theatre prop,I bought this in the clearance aisle of a local drug store and now I know why it was there. I am unable to receive any FM stations at all. I can receive a small number of AM stations but they have quite a bit of static. This is going directly into the garbage can.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"You definitely get what you pay for here... Junk total junk. Sure it's ok if you need desperately to listen to a radio in an emergency but it's uncomfortable with those hard plastic earpieces, it won't receive an AM station unless it's 10 megawatts and if you jump on a treadmill it turns to pure whining static and noise! You'll end up throwing them out just like I did."
1,was disappointed,"I bought this for my husband as a christmas present. I knew that it would not be of a real high quality, however, I must say that I was very disappointed in this item. The only thing that was positive about this radio was the reception and sound qaulity. The ear pieces have a hard little knob like thing that is extremly uncomfortable and makes it impossible to wear for more than a few minutes. Also in les than a month the head piece broke off the ear pieces. I would not recomend this item to anyone."
1,Not Recommended,"I am Brazilian and I do not recommend this DVD. It does not reflect the beauty of the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim.If you want to buy it, check it out first at a local DVD rental service or library. Some of those DVD of Brazilian Music are available for renting.The DVD has low quality. There are lots of improvisation on the music theme and the lyrics in english are different from the lyrics in portuguese. I guess, it has to do with the way that the words sound, rather then the accuracy of translation. The overall performance for a JAZZ Festival is good for someone who really likes Jazz, I guess. The person who introduce the singer has empty comments such as ""wonderful singer... beautiful bla bla bla"". He does not give you any information about the interpreter of the Jobin's music or any info about the music itself, very superficial. A pity. I donated my DVD to the local library in the same day I got It."
2,Disappointing,"Great premise, it's just that somehow the delivery was lacking, for me. I felt nothing for the characters and the plot didn't grab me at all. Like expecting a sizzle and getting a soft pop! I was hoping for clever banter, amusing characters, steamy lovemaking - I didn't find it."
2,variable speed?,my largest problem with this jigsaw is that the variable speed is..get this..a dial from 1 to 7 on the rear end of the handle...you cannot safely dial in the variable speed unless you remove a hand and set the speed..i wish i had researced jigsaws a little more thoroughly before purchasing.
2,memory stick,"I did receive the memory stick but did NOT receive the adapter necessary to utilize it. It was part of the order, as was a free calculator. I would not have ordered it if I knew the other items wouldn't come. Hard to review an item that you are unable to use. Would not use them again, be wary!!"
2,Nice BUT...,"Nice product, looks good and it protects the ipod. I'd give it 5 stars if the belt clip hadn't broken after 6 months. The clip is made of plastic or acrylic covering a steel clip. The problem is that the steel does not reinforce the part that you pinch to open up the clip. So after a few months of daily use it developed a stress fracture in a straight line just above the steel part of the clip. There is no way to fix it and the only thing to do is purchase another one which I won't do until the design is improved. Too bad, because otherwise this was a very handy addition to the ipod."
3,Great for a while...,"Fair warning, if you are one of those tight-butt and elitist Apple/Mac snobs who take pride in the stainless steel reflection of your ipods... this product is NOT for you. The smears it causes are difficult to get off. I don't care that much... the ipod still does what I bought it for.However, after a few months of taking it in and out (because it won't fit in any ipod appliances with it on), the rubber loses shape and the protective screen begins slipping and moving around. That's why I gave it just three stars. It won't last more than 6 months.On the bright side, aside from perhaps stabbing it with a knife, your ipod is safer in this rugged protector than in anything else on the market. I've dropped it from on top of the stairs and it protected my ipod. I don't suggest you do this, but if there is an accident, this gives your bank account the best chance of recovering."
3,it's okay,"not a perfect one but it is okay, its belt clip especially, moving so much you cannot adjust it the way you want"
1,SPECK TOUGH SKIN CASE FOR I POD NANO,THIS ITEM DID NOT ARRIVE IT'S ORIGINAL PACKAGE AND THE BELT CLIP WAS MISSING. I HAD TO GO TO A DEPARTMENT STORE AND PURCHASE A BELT CLIP FOR IT. THAT STORE HAD THIS ITEM IN IT'S ORIGINAL PACKAGE WITH THE BELT CLIP INCLUDED.THE IPOD FALLS OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TOUGH SKIN. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT.
3,Case Needs Improvement,"While this case fit well and provided excellent shock absorbtion, the two-piece belt clip function needs improvement. The belt clip did not hold the unit in tightly, so running and moving around the gym kept pulling the ipod out of the clip. I look down to see my ipod dangling at the end of the earphones. For casual use like walking around, this might be a good choice, otherwise, for sports, make another choice."
4,Best protection you can get for ipod nano,"Great protection for the ipod nano while leaving the hold button, wheel, and adapter port open and easily accessible. I use the toughskin generally only for running with my nike + ipod kit and both products are terrific! If you have an ipod and like to run I can't recommend both the toughskin and the nike products more!Only reason I didn't give 5 stars however, is because the clear clip is a POS! The first time you clip it to anything you can feel the plasic bending to the brink of snapping right off. However, for me personally, I actually had a perfect black clip to replace that one with and couldn't be happier."
3,Not a bad protector,I like this Ipod protector. It's really lightweight. One thing I don't like is that the plastic cover for the Ipod screen is not attached to the ToughSkin protector. I didn't know what to do with it.
4,Very Good Product,"Very well built and does what it was designed to do, that is to protect the MP3 player."
4,Saved my Ipod!,My Ipod nano has survived several drops thanks to this great little ToughSkin! Pluses: the screen and body are well-protected while the navigation ring is free for use. Minus: the belt clip was't very reliable and made it more cumbersome. I just took it off and was very happy with the toughskin!
4,Great performance. Too much bulk,"I use this with my MacBook Pro. Skype, etc. works great. Excellent office type performance.The material of the folding headphones appear a bit chinsy. I live in fear of breaking them.The DSP module is bulky.There is a half mile of cable with this thing. It is great if you are planning to walk around in the office with the headphones on - but...Net result - this thing is not for being taken on the road. If you need a decent pair of office headphone/mic set at a great price, go for it..."
4,DSP-400,I find this headset to be lightweight and comfortable. I am using this headset doing dictation (Dragon naturally speaking) voice recognition software. Microphone is very sensitive. I am happy with this product.
2,Buzzing noise on receiving end wouldn't go away,"I have several Plantronics devices that I'm really pleased with. That is why I chose the DSP-400 for use with Skype, expecting the same level of quality. I was wrong. While the physical design and sturdiness is up to standard, every Skype call I made with this headset created a really annoying buzzing noise on the receiving end. I could hear just fine, but every caller I spoke to complained about this buzzing noise. Since the buzzing only occurred with this headset, I had to return it to Amazon."
2,Audio Problem,"As with the DSP-500 headsets my company is using for their VOIP phone system, a test unit of this model also intermittently loses it's microphone audio--people can't hear me on the other end of the line--and the red mute light on the cord stays lit and can't be turned off. I've found this to be a chronic issue with these USB DSP headsets. You have to unplug/replug in the headset, then reboot--a total hassle in a corporate environment.On the other hand this unit is much lighter and more comfortable than the bulky DSP-500 units, and the sound quality is good, when it works."
1,many defects,This headset is not very portable or durable. Stopped working about 4 months after purchase. suggest you try something else
1,Dont trust them!!!!!!!!,"They never delivered the product, so be careful of these guys to come through if buy from them"
2,Skype Headphones,The headphones showed up and there is a huge part of them that goes un noticed when looking at them on the internet. I couldn't even tell you what that part does only that the headphones are meant for travel and this large switch or part makes it less attractive for travel.
4,Great Product,"First of all, This is NOT 4, it is 4 1/2.to answer everone else's problems, i just got this, and have been wearing this for two hours and find it so comftorbale, i need to put tthem back on. This headset has a sound card, so that lets you save processing power. No software is included or necesseary for intillation for Xp,2000 users. the cable is a bit on the long side, but to the people who find this distracting, i say, keep the metal wire holding the wrap on one of the 4 wraps! The sound quality is OK. thsi works well with Skype and MSN Messenger. there are more features, like the remote and such.also, one reviewr mentioned that there is somethig bugging him on the top, i find no problem at all.if you want to use headphones for an mp3 player look elsewherePROs:-Foldable-Easy on head and ears-Mic and Speakers are good-Included Sound card save PC Processing-USB 2.0 and 1.1 COmpatibleCons:-Lengthy CableAll in all this a great product, which i recommend for you"
5,Great for voice recognition,"Someone in an earlier review rated the DSP-400 headset as useless for voice recognition. Not sure what his technical problem might be, but Dragon rates it as ""6 dragons"" on its hardware compatability list which is the max, and I have bought two of them...at different times...one for work and one for home since I was so pleased with performance using two completely different types of PC's, memory size, etc. It works great for me at least. I am a long time Dragon user, and this is the best headset I have tried. So beware the ""worthless"" review. Picking the right headset that works with your particular system can be iffy...but I have two of these headsets and I couldn't be happier with the recognition voice quality. (I use Dragon Preferred Version 9 at the moment, so I can't say whether a different version would affect performance.)"
3,"Very comfortable, 2nd class sound quality",I've been trying out a number of these headsets(I'm picky) for skyping and podcasting. This is the most comfortable so far but the sound quality is not even in the ballpark with the Logitech 350 which cost $10 less. But if you don't care so much about quality and are going to wear one of these for hours it's extremely comfortable
1,Not for laptops,"The microphone is incredibly sensitive to electrical noise from laptop power supplies or powered USB hubs, causing a very obtrusive hum when used with applications such as Skype. As a result this Plantronics model can be used on laptops only when running on battery power. Since that's not practical, I am now the proud owner of a stylish $40 paperweight.It would have been easy for Plantronics to include a low-frequency rolloff around 120 Hz which would filter out the hum, but leave voice signals unchanged. (Unless you're singing a bass part....)It's a pity, really, because otherwise the sound quality is quite good."
4,Very Good Headset,"I use this primarily with Skype as I do a lot of international consulting work. It is simple, reliable and the software interface with Win/Mac is easy. Be sure to adjust the bass, treble, etc. using the audio control interface. It is also perfectly usable for music and movies though not as high quality as you would get from dedicated high-end music phones"
3,not so portable,"The nice things about these headphones is that the USB2 connection bypasses the sound card. That lowers ambient noise and makes for clearer dictation (I am using Dragon). It's also easier to hook up. But I bought these to be the headset I bring on the road with me, and after you bundle up the wires, fold up the head phones and add the DSP module, its quite a handful. I wish they provided a carry bag - you need one. Still probably smaller than a full sized headset, these over the head phones do not sit very well on y our head, something slight wrong about the angle."
4,"Great for Daily ""Telephone"" Use","I bought this product to use as my phone over VOIP. I am hoping to be able to use it nearly exclusively for overseas phone calls. So far, no one seems to notice that I am using VOIP. Set up was instant (plug it into the USB port), the VOIP provider's software had no issue at all with it, and the sound on my end is good too.I am truly happy with this product, especially considering it's cheaper than a phone. I am very impressed that it picks up my naturally quiet and high-pitched voice without any trouble."
3,Your average headset...,"Good quality, a totally geek look, bulky and flimsy.Sound and mic pick up everything.It makes you look like a telephone operator or a nerd playing on WoW (perhaps like me).The DSP box is huge for what it's supposed to do.The compact folding is flimsy, when you set the headset down and it starts to fold back up.I have speakers and use a headset. So I have 2 sound options, problems can occur.USB function, I particularly do not appreciate enough. The USB sound controls my external speakers and NOT just the headset. Analog may not be as clean, but it is definitely more controlable. And they used to make one that wraps around the back of the head.Find a cheap analog Plantronics. I had one before for 19.99 and it lasted me about 2 years, but I tend to be rough with my things."
2,1/2 Way There,"The sound on this product is actually really good. I was impressed. Unfortunately, while the microphone ""test"" button records my voice, I haven't actually been able to get the microphone to work in any other application."
3,ok,"The quality is ok, but can be very noisy. A bit disapointed with its DSP. It is abit bulky. I used for mac."
1,Inadequate for Voice Recognition,"It failed Dragon Naturally Speaking's sound tests, tests easily passed by the cheapo mike included with the program. And just try to return it. Antonline stonewalls, Plantronics doesn't respond at all."
2,Less Than I Expected,"I purchased this headset about nine months ago after reading all the largely positive reviews. This headset is used primarily for voice recognition dictation with Nuance Naturally Speaking 9.0. First, I was put off by the very long cord and the large audio processing unit on it. Then, I felt the folding headset to be pretty rinky dink and too fragile for traveling. But, I rationalized that surely the digital enhancement would greatly improve the voice recognition leading to reduced typing errors and justifying this purchase. After several months of retraining the software to the new device, I returned to using the ""el cheapo"" headset I initially received from Nuance, which produces far fewer typing errors."
4,Sound quality is good. Still a little big for traveling.,"The unit folds up nicely but the cord has what looks like a ballast that is almost the same size as the folded headset. The sound quality is just fine, but I was hoping for a USB headset that was a bit smaller. I now have it at office for Skype and dictation, hope to find a smaller one soon."
4,"light-weight, high quality audio","love these headphones. they're comfy and sound great. only complaint is the big bulky box attached to it, but i keep it under my desk and hidden, so it's only an issue when I travel with my laptop."
1,do not get what I ordered. Was charged for a more expensive item and sent a lesser quality item. NOT HAPPY! with this company,"I ordered a DSP-400 Digitally Enhanced USBfoldable Stereo Headset AND Software for $63.95. What I got was just the head set that they charge $40 on this web site. I did not get the software. They say to call within 48 hours if there is a problem. However, they don't provide a contact phone number. Now I have to call my cc company and file a complaint. I think this was is sloppy and irresponsible way to do business on the web. Especially with the amazon name behind them. I won't buy anything from this company again. Maryann Kaczmarek"
1,I shouldnt have gone for this.,"Pros : Sound quality is good as they sayCons :Doesnt look so good. Doesnt look neat.Not comfortable to wear.The enhancer and the mic looks big as if this is a headset made in 1930'sMoral : I am not at all satisfied with this product, did not expect such one from My Favourite brand Plantronics.I am returning this back to amazon. !"
1,"Unimpressive, poor audio quality","I bought this headset thinking I would use it with voice recognition software on my Mac Powerbook. The fact that they fold up was a selling point because I thought they would fit well into my laptop bag ... but the bing dongle thing which seems to contain the electronics is huge and intrusive and the cord it too long to be helpful. What makes it worse is that the audio quality of the stereo headphones is poor and the recording quality is also poor as it seems to skip over words or mangle parts of them ... and I have an excellent speaking voice (everybody always wants me to read aloud). (And, not to be nitpicky, but they come in one of those hard clear plastic coffins that makes it almost impossible to get them out of the packaging without wrap rage.)So I definitely don't recommend them. And now I'm looking for something better. Maybe I will have to be stuck carrying one headset for voice recognition and another for music and dvds ... rats."
1,Failed Dragon Naturally Speaking test,"Pros: nice headset, neat folding design.Cons: Despite endorsement from ScanSoft/Nuance, signal-to-noise ratio was unacceptable when I tested it using DNS software. If you're buying for voice recognition, consider another product.Also ran into USB conflict problems.You can do better elsewhere."
2,Flimsy headset with bulky box of electronics,"Ok to be fair, I shall point out the good before the bad. I have no complaints with the sound quality offered by this headset. The mic is well adjustable.On the downside, what you gain in space by having a foldable headset, you lose with the long wires (I was only going to plug into my laptop, so could do without the 11' cable from headset to usb). The whole thing was flimsy. It's one step forward and two steps back. The material on the ear piece made my ears itch so couldn't have it on for too long.I prefered the Logitech USB 20 with it leather-style ear pieces. Even though it wasn't completely foldable, you could twist the earpieces 90deg to make it flat.But most annoying of all was the bulky audio interface box. It's not as if you can disconnect the headset from the box and plug it into the audio style speaker and mic ports... so *what* is the point??Basic flaws -- I'm just so upset at Plantronics!"
2,Beware !,"1. This is NOT a noise cancelling headset : it has just a noise cancelling microphone so this only works in filtering your voice (I can't really see the point...), NOT the surrounding environment (like airplane buzz or aircon in the office). 2. It only has a USB plug, no hifi-jack so forget using it with an MP3 or CD player. 3. The CD-Rom with the Plantronics software was defective. 4. Plantronics customer's support is difficult to access and poor. The FAQ's on their site are uselesss (try to figure out if the DSP 400 has a Noise Cancelling function, good luck ...) If you want a Noise Cancelling, try the Maxell NoiseBuster (probably the best deal 40$) or the Koss QuietZone 2000 (better but is it worth 140$ vs. the Maxell ?). Taipan92"
4,Great!! But need little improvement..,"I bought dsp-400 to use SKYPE and play online games like Counter Strike. The quality of sound is great and in gameplay wise, u can hear any footsteps or any gun sounds from distance with perfect quality.Like others have said, the few problems with dsp-400 is the really long cable with sound card box on the line. The idea of folding headset is very unique. But with long cable, it is not meant to carry other places, and I almost break the headset when I tried to unfold the folded headset. When dsp-400 is in folded form, it just seems so fragile.(Thank god for 1 yr warranty..)Overall, it is great with the price that cheap, but i would recommend dsp-500 for gamers seeking for headset. This headset is not bad in games, but dsp-500 just picks the sound better than dsp-400 due to ear-covering design. Ppl who are just looking for it to chat online, this is great stuff to have."
3,"Sounds Great, a Bit Clunky","I like the sound, both headset and microphone. Be sure to download and install the PerSono application from Plantronics, since it really makes a big difference.My big beef is that it's not really as portable as I'd like -- The big extra unit in the wire really adds bulk, and even after folding up the headset it's still not a very easy thing to wrap up in a way that won't make a mess in my bag. Once you decide that it's not really all that easy to haul around, the foldup aspect becomes sort of moot."
3,11 feet of wire!,"I just received these headphones and have not used them enough to comment on their sound quality. The installation of the drivers was simple enough.However, this headset includes 11 feet of wire!! I bought the FOLDING set of headphones because I thought they would be more portable. What part of portable does Plantronics not understand? 11 feet of cable is 8 feet more than I need on a portable set of headphones."
1,Warning -- not portable!,"The folding headband for this headset is nicely engineered. But don't buy this headset expecting it to be foldable to a small size for carrying with your laptop, in your carry-on bag, etc. The cord is *extremely* long--maybe 10ft (why?)--and attached to it is a plastic filter/converter box that is nearly the size of the AC power brick on my laptop power cord. By the time you have it all wrapped up for stowage the entire package is just as large as the conventional headset I was replacing with this purchase--even with the headset folded."
