1,The show is brilliant; the price is indefensible,"I'm adding my voice to the chorus of Breaking Bad devotees who would certainly buy Season 1 if the price were fair and reasonable but it isn't so they don't--and neither will I. Not only are there only 7 episodes in Season 1, but the episodes are a only a bit over 45 minutes long so commercials can fill the rest of the hour. There is no show I love better, none better scripted, better acted or better photographed. AMC deserves a lot credit for bringing us such an original series. But SONY deserves the blame for charging as though it is a full season when it isn't."
5,Great viewing,I bought this series blind and absolutely delighted with the series - if a little short! Dark subjects but well written and portrayed with reality and feeling and of course some terrific humour. Only problem is now waiting for the next series to emerge!
5,"Breaking Bad, 1st Season","Awesome product, spent a very happy evening watching this, although I intended to spread out the experience, it was just like one of those books you can't put down."
3,Looks interesting.,"Looks interesting, but not at that price per episode, and I lost interest, just not my world I guess. Oh. well."
4,It started out being so electric-,"I wonder if people aren't afraid to rate it a little lower just because nobody else did. There are some good characters and some great writing, and the first episode was absolutely riveting. But there are also some long, drawn-out boring parts to most of the remaining episodes.I don't need to see so much angst-ridden family discussion about the main character's disease. I don't need to see the man who's going through chemo vomiting, much less twice. They could have found somebody better to play his wife, I found her to be vaguely annoying, boring and stereotypical.It's almost like a made-for-TV version of a Quentin Tarantino movie.But when it's good, it's great."
4,It was ok,Actually I didn't watch it Someone recommended it somI was just testing it but it was actually about the making of the series and I didnt have time to watch it
5,Breaking bad,Addictive! A must see. The story line is both disturbing and brilliant. My only hope is that Walt will become a bit tougher character. The cast is great and they each have their own interesting quirks.
5,Love it,"Love this show, never seen the first season so I wanted to start from the beginning. Alot of violence tho."
4,Breaking Awesome,"Just started watching season one after putting it off and off for ages, just wasn't sure that it was going to be my cup of tea or not, but oh my god, i was so wrong. 3 episodes in and I am so addicted, brilliant writing, brilliant acting, brilliant show."
4,"On Demand Versions Not Same As DVD, is Censored","The DVD version of Breaking Bad is uncensored. Amazon VOD is not. There is no additional content but certain words are not blanked out and certain screens are not blurred. I don't want to give examples since that would create spoilers, but you'll see the differences in the pilot episode at a minimum."
1,Beware: Show is great but this is a censored version!,"I was really confused when I bought this (video on demand) and realized that swear words were being omitted and there was a blur out of some frontal nudity. It does not affect the show quality at all, but I feel that if I am paying for the show I should see the whole original show! There was no label or warning that I saw to indicate that this was censored."
5,Get Hooked,This is one series that never fails to draw in the viewer and amaze them. We can't get enough of Breaking Bad.
5,Breaking Bad Is a Heavenly Treat,I dont know how else to say this but BB is one of the greatest tv show of all time.The writing is brilliant.The actors give one of the greatest performances put to film.For me breaking bad has changed the way I look at tv shows.Like everything I thing i watch now is trash compared to breaking bad.i havent gotten around to watching the sopranos and the wire but it doesnt matter.In my opinion breaking bad will always be my favorite and greatest tv show.
5,Compelling show that will pull you in for extended viewings,"Do not start watching this unless you are prepared to watch at least 2 or 3 of them a night until you've watched the entire series. Really great acting, really great story line."
5,Best Series,"By far and away the best series ever broadcast on tv. Best acted ,best directed , best produced, best written. If you haven't watched this series then you need to."
5,Love the Conflicted Characters,I like the psychologically-complicated characters in this series. Morality is hardly ever black and white; and this show seems to explore that.
4,Shocking beginning of series.,"Had I seen the beginning, I'm not sure I would have watched the series as it is rough to watch. However, I stared during Season 3, bought Season 2 so wanted to catch up from beginning. Now waiting for 3 to see all episodes. It is good. I learned about the drug world which was my reason to watch in the first place. Money is the reason for everything for the makers and dealers. Not a world I would want to live in but needed to know about."
5,Best - show - ever,"Hands down. Buy this DVD. You won't regret it. Promise. Great acting, Incredible story, cool cinematics. Just buy it already"
4,Compelling,"When I first heard about this show I figured we were at the point where a few producers through a hundred different ideas into a hat, pull out five and then make a show about it. On paper this just sounded like a bunch of lame elements thrown together, but I've been pleasantly surprised. It manages to take all of those ""lame"" elements and intricately weave them all together in a somewhat (for TV) believable way.If you're a fan of shows like Dexter, Weeds and Sopranos, this show is right up your alley. It's detail-rich with great characters and interesting twists. I'm glad they renewed it and I hope they get a few more seasons out of it. With the way season 2 is shaping up, they're setting it up for quite a few more seasons. Sweet!"
5,Outstanding performance!,"Breaking Bad TV series is an outstanding piece of work from the cast and crew. Kudos to the director for making this one of the very best TV series that I have ever watched in my life. I rarely praise any TV drama but honestly this TV series is one of the most addicting series ever. The work is technically perfect! Everything is well done from acting to sound effects to storytelling. There is something for everyone in the household to watch and enjoy.Warning! After watching this series, you will find most other popular TV series dull and boring! I am confident that within less than 10 mins into the season 1 episode 1 show you will get addicted and cannot stop watching the series.Excellent! 5 Stars!"
5,"Breaking Bad is a great series, this is just a sneak peak--don't be fooled!","Once again, I gave this a 5-star because the series itself is absolutely that and more! However, this is simply some sneak peak of the show---not sure why Amazon puts these up with no real notice that its only an 11-minute waste of time. When you are hooked on this show and you want to see what happens next, the last thing you want to click on in hopes of finding out what happens, is to click on a preview of crap. Lol- no offense but these shows should be included with our $79/yr membership that is paid!!! Note to Amazon: Hulu is beating you in this area!"
5,Believe The Hype....,"Outstanding 1st season!I loved this show!Brian Cranston was hands down ""phenomenal"" as Walter White and easily deserved his Emmy. Aaron Paul is awesome in his role as Jesse Pinkman, and all the other cast members seemed to be a perfect fit.I knew the show was good, because of all the rave reviews, but I was'nt expecting it to be this good! ""Breaking Bad"" Season 1 has a 5 star overall rating here on Amazon.Great writing, great timing and development of the characters. The storyline is dramatic, hilarious and keeps you watching. Just when you think the story is starting to slow down, they nail you with something big!I watch alot of TV seasons on DVD (The Shield, CSI, Rescue Me), because I work at night. I haven't seen a show in its 1st season that was this good, since ""Dexter Sea. 1""!The only bad part about this show, was that the 1st season was only 7 episodes! Looking forward to the next season already!Highly, highly recommended!"
5,Obsessed,I give this 5 stars. Exceptionally good quality. Very obsessed with this series! I can't wait to see more! My boyfriend and I watch at least or episode before bed. Sometimes I have to watch two episodes because I am so addicted.
1,pistol,"We bought this to scare the squirels on the bird feeders.When we shot it , we could have thrown the pellet. It is useless."
1,Never worked,We spent an hour trying to get this to work and it never did. I noticed oil leaking out the top - not a good sign.
1,just dont buy the gun!,well to begin with i have to say the gun looked awsome when i opened it but as i put in batteries couldnt fiure out how to shoot it! i pulled the trigger a million times to no avail! but once i figured out that you have to hold down the safety to shoot it i started dry fireing it! once done with that i started to fill up the thing they call a clip and ass i was doing that my bro picked up the gn and dry fired it twice and on the 2nd shot the motor burned out! being curius i decided to take apart the gun to see if the roblem could be fixed and it was just a lost cause! so after going back and forth with the seller i gave up and ripped out the insides so now it just looks cool! other than that it was probably the worst airsoft purchase ever!! please do not buy or you will regret!!! i never got to fire one shot!
3,Ok product,"At first i was very happy with the product, it was very nice looking and seemed to be a quality product. Within 2 months the letters started to peel off the front and now i am left with a ineligible story. If you plan on just showing the Zippo or carrying in your vehicle rather then your pocket i think its an ok product. BUT!!! if you plan on using this lighter as an everday use type of lighter think again...unless u dont mind the words peeling off."
4,"LipStick Jungle, series","I really enjoyed this show and was disappointed that the show discontinued. I was also disappointed the the DVDs don't show the entire series. A lot of shows missing. It would have been nicer if the whole, every show, was included on the DVDs."
4,Lipstick Jungle,"I was & still is a big fan of the show!! I have the first season, so this was an added plus. I recommend the dvd for the ultimate Lipstick Jungle fan!!"
4,Good movie,This is a well done movie. Prepare yourself for realistic and difficult scenes. Not recommended for anyone under 18. Has a strong gay/street hustler theme
3,Ponderous,"Well-meant portrayal of the life of David Wojnarowicz who died of AIDS as told through slow, poetic ruminations about his abusive father and early life as a street hustler. While sometimes very effective (and beautiful), the somber, disjointed style becomes a little too self-absorbed and overwhelms the brief, lighter moments of comedy and sex."
4,A world where forbidden lust is being aroused,"The author has wonderfully twisted the orignality of Bram Stocker's Dracula. A fiction that writes on the arousal of forbidden lust of individuals such as Mina Harker through spanking and erotica caressing. On a personal preference, reading would be more stimulated if it is being written in a third party perspective rather than the ""I"" perspective."
3,"It works, but it could be better","This is a ""generic"" PDA support. It does work, but I think the suction area is not big enough and sometimes it can detach itself from the windshield."
4,A less known Classical composer,Donizetti is less known because of people like Mozart and Hayden. Donizetti is just as great as them in my opinion. The piano duets prove me right. I really enjoyed the works because they had that classical music charm. Honostly I think that Donizetti should be more rrecognized for his achievments. I higly recomend this CD.
1,"I'm sure the techniques work, however why do marriage photos..",why do personal marriage photos fill up the latter half of the book?I am surprised at amazon .com.
5,Rocks!!,"Amazing album! Great Songs...Richie played all instruments and All Voices, All songs written by Richie.He played drums on Paul Stanley (KISS) Solo Album 1978."
4,"Great book...up to 1992, that is","This is a fine book by Anthony Frewin regarding all the relevant films and tv programs from 1963-1992...but what about 1993-2006? I hope he follows up and does an update. I am on several pages regarding the Zapruder film and the June 1991 Third Decade Conference in Fredonia, NYVince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
3,New problem,"Well, I have had trouble in the past with off brand CD-Rsbut I never expected Taiyo's to not work. I tried on 3 CD writers and only one works sometimes. What gives."
1,Stream of an arrogant consciousness,"I simply hate the arrogant.All the books of this author convey the same message,I,Aldo Busi,am THE BEST ever,and all those who disagree whit me are worthless and despicable.I won't question the literary merits(if there are at all )of this author:I strongly question his pretense of superiority.And for fun and sexual arousal,go somewhere else (Alan Hollinghurst,Joe Keenan,Robert Rodi,to name a few.)"
4,For What It Is,"Squadron Signal books are primarily printed as an aid to model builders. With this in mind, amost the entirety of the book is dedicated to detailed photos and drawings of the aircraft in question."
3,An interesting side note to WW2,"This magazine-style book covers the Allied aircraft that landed in Switzerland during WW2 and is an interesting piece.Mostly photos and color illustrations, it is a good source for information on a little-known corner of WW2."
1,same story... not sure the same result,"same thing happened to me... must be a favorite of contractors for new houses. WE're going on our 3rd anniversary in this house and the microwave just stopped heating. So, after reading these reviews along with others I've found I thnk I'll just skip the service call and buy a new (not whirlpool) microwave."
2,Don't get this microwave!,"I have had this microwave for 3 years. I bought it along with the brand new house, today I wanted to warm up some food and ""nothing"". Everything seems to be working fine but it won't heat the food. I called Whirlpool and they where not helpful at all. What they did do was recommend a service tech's name and number and he charges $150.00 to come in plus the parts depending on what they are. So basically they want me to pay more to fix this microwave instead of less to replace it. Whatever happend to buying something and it working until you didn't like it anymore and then replacing it?"
4,I recommend this cd to all Sergio Vargas fans,"For years I was looking for one of my favorites merengue songs of all times: La ventanita. I finally found it in this compilation of Sergio Vargas best known songs. This is a very enjoyable cd with good merengue, and you will find that all of the songs are nearly as good as La ventanita. I have to rate it with four stars though because it lacks the other one song I like the most from Vargas: Marola."
4,Great Cha cha CD,"If you want Cha Cha music with a beat that is easy to feel, then this CD should work just fine. I bought this CD because my spouse was having trouble finding the Cha Cha beat while we danced together. Dancing the music from this collection has made it easier and more enjoyable for us. All of the tracks are well-suited for Cha Cha and fun to dance to."
5,Cha Cha,Excellent music and composition. Lively and exciting music allows the dancers to tune in on various beats.
1,"Sorry, I just don't get it","This came up on my Instant Recommendations, and after reading the customer comments, I decided to give it a try.And I have learned that I will not read Mark Leyner again. Perhaps I'm missing something here, but I simply did not find this disjointed mishmash of unreadable gibberish at all funny.My personal opinion is: Skip it."
3,"Et Tu, Bah","Having read, My Cousin, My Gastroenterologist, I had high hopes for Et Tu, Babe. However, other than a few hilarious venues(the ""everything"" sandwich, visceral tattoos, and the Schwarzeneggerization of America), this was a disappointment. I wound up skimming through too much tedium. I suspect Leyner had personal problems midway (the Arlene Scene) as the 2nd half of the book d r a g s. Nun thee less, Leyner when he's on is one of the funniest orgasmic writers around."
5,Great book and shipping,Book was awesome! Really weird but great. Shipping was extremely quick. I didn't expect it for another day or so. Very happy.
3,"Not my thing really, but still interesting","I sort of enjoyed this book. It is really a disjointed series of vignettes, basically a kind of post-modern stream of consciousness style of writing. The book has it's funny parts, the main one being the vial of Lincoln's morning breath, which is probably the funniest section in the book.Another reviewer here said that Leyner is funnier than Chris Moore. Well, there is no way Leyner is funnier, but he is certainly stranger than Moore, and that is saying something. I would go so far as to say he is even unique in his own way, and I give him points for being able to come up with such a sustained montage of weird topics to write about.I would probably think more of Leyner as a writer if it weren't for the fact that I could do a pretty good facsimile of this sort of writing myself, except that this was 30 years ago before anyone had heard of Leyner.Anyway, this book does have its moments. Entertaining in it own wacked out sort of way."
4,"Dangerously strange, babe","Is Mark Leyner a genius or an egotist? In Et Tu, Babe, some might say he is making blood sacrifices at the Hunter S. Thompson Shrine of Self-Involvement.The Mark Leyner of Et Tu, Babe would then simply clock them in the chops with a pool cue and satirize them into submission.Leyner manages to capture the fever dreams of Burroughs, the sci-fi sarcasm of Vonnegut, and yes, the megalomania of Thompson in one novel. It all works startlingly well. Enter with gusto and submit to the exquisiteness of this shockingly funny book, babe."
1,Oy,"Never has an author who is not David Foster Wallace so desperately wished to be, or be confused with, David Foster Wallace. ""Look at me!"", he jumps up and down shouting on every page, ""I'm random! I'm hip! I'm hyper-verbal!""Never has an author been so besotted with his own sense of humor, yet so lacking for one.Never have the adjectives self-indulgent and smug so aptly described a writer.Never has the offer of a publishing contract been more puzzling.Et Tu Babe is a 10th grade piece of creative writing dressed up in Master's degree verbiage. It's all flash, no substance. And it ain't much flash.At least it was a quick read.(Mark Leyner: you're no David Foster Wallace.)"
1,Great for homes but landscaping NO WAY,"I have just bought this software and although this is good for homes (not alot of selection like chimneys) this is not the way to go for landscaping. There are not enough plants to be happy with and the plants that are there you can not change the height or how wide they get. The plant editor is lousy as well, the plants all look like pices of cardboard cutouts. I would not recommand this software."
1,Horrible Technical Support,I encourage anyone to think twice or more before buying this product. I purchased it and had great difficulty in installing it on a new Dell XP Professional system. My call to techncial support was both rude and unsuccessful. Technical support does not want to support the product until it is installed! This means you are on your own until you get it running.I finally gave up and trashed the product and will be looking for a replacement There are many others in the market which work and have valid technical support.
2,"I tried, oh I really tried.","I read and ignored the reviews bashing this product, but bought it anyway. I figured that all I had to do was read the instructions. The instruction manual is 2 inches thick, but I went through the important part for me, landscaping. Then the software was not very easy, though not very hard. But. There are no labels on the plants. When you click one, you don't know if it is a Sequoia or a fern. The other landscape design softwares are also rather simple minded. But for this kind of money and trouble, this should have been pretty and useful, but it was not that way for me."
5,"""Lighthouse Adventures"" Delivers on the promise of the title","This is the first book I've read by Wes Oleszewski -- but it won't be the last. ""Lighthouse Adventures"" transports the reader to another time. A time of everyday heros who place their own lives at risk to save others.If you've wondered what service in the US Lighthouse Service or the US Lifesaving Service was like before electric lights, radio communications and GPS, this book will take you there.Illustrated with historic black and white photos (as well as some contemporary photos by the author) and location maps. My only criticism is the reproduction of the photos could have been sharper.The author's meticulus research and you-are-there writing style makes ""Lighthouse Adventures"" a real page turner. Those who love the Great Lakes and their rich nautical history as well as lighthouse lovers everywhere will want to add this one to their library. Highly recommended!"
1,So long...,Don't know anything at all about this phone. But how could you buy from a company that calls you a fool for buying their products? Jut say the second word of the brand name out loud and you'll know what I mean. :}
3,"Nice collection, but make sure you know what you're buying.","This item's description is ambiguous, so I want to point to people that it is NOT a book-length analysis or appreciation of Cash's songs, it is merely a COLLECTION OF HIS LYRICS, categorised by the editor. The introduction is interesting and well-written, but can be read easily with Amazon's preview feature without purchasing."
4,Whew! Talk About Gritty!,"This is NOT a book for readers who like their detectives to be women with pet cats. ... Kurtz tears it up. But Kurtz is the ultimate problem solver, a Spenser without the poetry, and beneath his tough exterior, there rests a sense of justice. Direct, non-procedural, bloody -- but righteous. The book is fast paced and engrossing. The characters may not be likeable, but they are certainly not boring. I have read a lot of Simmons' work, finding it to be a bit uneven overall. But in the Joe Kurtz series, his writing has been consistantly high caliber. I look forward to number 3."
1,piece of junk,"I BOUGHT THE COOKIE SHEET STONE FROM AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT, AND IT CRACKED ON THE FIRST USE, YOU ARE OUT OF LUCK IF THE CONSULTANT DROPS OUT OF BUSINESS, HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH PARTY LITE CANDLES, WILL NEVER PURCHASE THIS JUNK AGAIN. SAD, SAD, WILL BUY STONE FROM COOKWARE/DEPARTMENT STORE WHERE IT CAN BE RETURNED IF DEFECTIVE NO QUESTIONS ASKED."
1,Great stone until it cracks,I cooked about 10 pizzas at 450F and the stone shattered into pieces under normal circumstances. Don't waste the money.
1,Poor quality product,I have to echo concerns from two other reviews regarding this stone: it cracked in the oven untouched while baking a pziza during its second use (cannot handle high temperatures) and only buy from a consultant otherwise they won't replace this poorly constructed stone that is sure to break.
3,Lacking a bit.,"This is not ""traditional yoga"", the presenter jam packs his positions into a short time period. It is good to show a lot of positions, but I personally just picked out my favorite ones and do them without even watching the video anymore.This DVD will be all up to your personal taste. A little hyped up and over priced in my opinion."
4,Great Book!,"I have met many pastors, but never have I heard stories that Mark shares in this book. His remarkable honesty with people is something special. If you have had dealings with planting a church, this book is an encouraging read that brings alive the pains and joys of the process."
4,Makes you want to get busy serving Christ!,"I really enjoyed this book, although I often was uncomfortable because I'm just not living my Christian walk the way I could/ should be. Driscoll is very motivational, while being very real and even raw."
4,Relevant Orthodoxy,"Mark Driscoll has marked a clear trail for those who desire to be relevant while remaining radically orthodox. Having waded through the land minds of a new generations desire to reach the world for Christ, he has come through in one piece bearing some great wisdom on how to relate to the postmodern culture while remaining deeply committed to the age old tenants of the faith. His work will make you laugh, and it might make you mad, but it will surely challenge you to authentic Christianity. Thanks Driscoll for sharing reality in Christ. It is true apostolic genius. Tom Griner"
2,NOT the original Sambucol,"just a heads up, this not the original Sambucol product developed by Dr. Madeleine Mumcuoglu, which Nature's Way distributed previously. The description is old and dated, incorrectly stating you will receive Sambucol, not the current Nature's Way product Sambucus.If you had good luck with the product before, you can still order it under the original name. Just search for Sambucol."
4,Great product,"When I feel I am coming down with a cold or body aches, I get a bottle of Elderberry and a good night sleep to fight off any cold/flu symptoms. I rarely use over-the-counter medicines and I have not have any antibiotics for over a decade, but the use of Aloe and Elderberry has help me to stay very healthy. I reiterate, these products helped me and it may not work for everyone at there. I highly recommend this product."
2,Needs a different sweetener,I think this would be a wonderful product if it did not contain sorbitol. This is a very bad for people with blood sugar issues. I thought the product would be good for my child with metabolic syndome but had to throw it away.If you used a sweetener like xylitol or stevia (or no sweetener at all) I would consider trying it again.
3,Beach towel,"Bought this Steelers beach towel for my son. Found for the price, the terry cloth was a bit thin."
1,hope it doesnt need repair,"I agree that this system is well beyond any type of expectation. Just pray that it doesnt need repair. Given that Nakamichi went Chapter 11 and that this is such a high-tech equipment. Only an authorized repair center will be able to fix it.... Surprise tehre is only 1 in the US. Which I was able to find after three months of crossing emails with HQ, and many frustrating letters. I sent it for repair, received it back, only for it to work two more months.Beatiful system, great sound, superb look, pitiful customer service, lame repair center."
5,Absolutely Fabulous,I love this one...am shocked it's such a low price..mine was purchased in Barcelona around 2001 and it's NEVER had a problem...just happy I can leave it behind with the sale of my place and know that I can get another for almost nothing.
4,Skillful means,"Wu Kwang is a versatile teacher, not afraid to be scholarly, not afraid to be eloquent, not afraid to be blunt. He uses classic Buddhist and Zen stories when necessary, in addition to contemporary teachings when necessary. Exemplifying the Buddhist teaching ideal of ""skillful means,"" Zen Master Wu Kwang brings both a wide-reaching wealth of knowledge and a strong foundation of practice to his teaching, both of which are evident in this book. It's a good read besides."
2,"Aw man, come on Ace-One!","I hate to admit this, but in my collection of over 100 cds, this is the only CD I have ever returned in my life. I can't believe what happened to Aceyalone. His rap style got bland, his lyrics pointlessly violent and I didn't laugh or smile once the whole album. This CD sounds like a halfasses mainstream CD with little substance and even less musical value. The beats are boring and the choruses are at times painful to listen to, especially ""Love and Hate"". Fans of Ace-One, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! Try to find a copy of any thing he made before this garbage."
5,aceyalone is transcending ...,"easily one of the most original albums of this genre. aceyalone is always experimental, but this album pushes the limits..recommended to fans of music"
2,"Good movie, sucky soundtrack","I bought this CD for the Aaron Neville song ""Crazy Love"". The Eric Clapton song ""Change the World"" was a bonus. Otherwise, the CD was not that great. The rest of the album is a bunch unknown songs."
2,Incomplete AGAIN!,"I'd have to agree with a couple of the other reviewers... Why is it that all of the beautiful orchestrated music tracks are for the most part, left off of these soundtracks? Yes, the other music is good, but when it is advertised as the ""Music Soundtrack,"" then why doesn't it include ALL of the music from the movie? The only reason the music industry will not switch to MP3 to fit all of the music on one CD is money, pure and simple. The consumer is paying a fee for minutes allocated on the CD and if there were more music they would feel obligated to collect more money from the consumer. Why is this? When I buy a movie on DVD, not only do I get the complete theatrical uncut release, I usually get bonus material and sometimes both widescreen and pan and scan formats... Someone needs to tell the music industry to wake up!"
2,Missing music from Phenomenon,"I have been looking for this music for some time - I think it is the music which appears on The Shawshank Redemption (also by Thomas Newman) - track called ""Brooks was here""."
2,where's the actual score???,"The other tracks are great songs themselves, but the main reason why I wanted this soundtrack was that Thomas Newman is one of my absolute favorite composers. So besides the last track, ""The Orchard,"" where is the rest of the amazing original score??"
1,Incomplete---AGAIN---Revisited,"A March 7, 2004 review by C. Michael Rusk pointed out that much of the beautifully orchestrated music from the film has been left off the soundtrack CD. WHY? There are many who viewed AND ENJOYED the movie partly BECAUSE OF THE MUSIC. Since much of the film score has not been included on the soundtrack CD, I'll not buy it. Dumb move by ""the music industry"" I believe.Thus, Amazon, you've LOST A SALE (God forbid). Maybe you should ""talk"" to the soundtrack producers about this error in judgment."
3,I agree there is music missing,I just saw Phenomenon in TV ( not my first time watching it) and I wanted to get the music which is played whenever it shows the trees swaying and I cant find it anywhere. I thought I could find it on my fileshare program ( which I bought I am not downloading without owning the program) Anyways it doesnt come up. I have beautiful music from A Beautiful Mind and Forrest Gump etc but the title of this instrumental piece is missing and isnt on the soundtrack which is odd because it is featured a few times throughout the movie.
1,....,"Who makes the decisions on these soundtracks -- what to include, what to discard? Thomas Newman's magic MADE this movie -- no less than his artistry is what made Shawshank Redemption or American Beauty work. So why screw it up by including all these other goofy rock tunes when it's Newman's work that makes the movie work in the first place. For those who just INSIST on having a smorgasborg of incoherent, disconnected rock-and-roll songs in the car's CD player, they should make one version of the Phenomenon Soundtrack. And for those of us who LOVED THE MOVIE, they should make another: a Soundtrack CD that really does contain the orchestrated score that is the heart and soul of the movie itself. (Only one cut on this soundtrack, ""The Orchard"" is Newman's work to begin with. What a sham!) Is that too much to ask?"
2,Another incomplete soundtrack,Anyone expecting the original soundtrack music will be disappointed. Anyone who just wants the oldies cuts will make out fine. I always find it very irritating when I end up with a soundtrack that eliminates much of the key music for no particularly good reason.
5,Very Spirit lifting,Sometimes it is not only the words in a song that make it sing it is how it touches your soul/spirit. My spirit is uplifted everytime I close my eyes and really LISTEN. I think this is an outstanding album and I now have 2 copies one for the car and one for the house. I invite more people to take the time enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed.
2,Incomplete Soundtrack,"It would be nice, as a couple of other reviewers stated, to have included some of the ""score"" as well as the songs and arrangements already present. I was hoping their would be a bit of that when I ordered it. The songs are good but didn't warrant listening to the CD more than a couple of times."
3,Instant Tabouli Salads,"I have been a user of instant Tabouli salad mixes for several years. I make a big bowl at least once a week.I tried to purchase the Fantastic brand again on Amazon but it was unavailable so I tried the Casbah brand that was available.It is not as satisfying. The flavor is off in a way that is difficult to describe. I think it may be from the contents of the dried parsley. With the Fantastic brand, I always use fresh parsley and mint but with the Casbah product, both are included ingredients.I would rate this product a 3 out of 5 but the Fantastic brand 4.5 out of 5. Look for it. Ask for it if they dont have it. It is convenient and worth it."
4,Healthy side dish,"I make this according to instructions and it seems to work fine. Additional ingredients are recommended depending on your needs or tastes.For example, sometimes I add fresh tomatoes or sweet onions, cucumber, olives, celery . . . whatever. Usually fresh lemon if it is available.The added ingredients lift the flavors and give it more character. If you want even more depth, use hot broth instead of water to reconstitute the dehydrated ingredients."
5,"great value, good product","I have purchased this same product in grocery stores, but got a much better deal by purchasing it at Amazon. I don't turn on my oven more than I have to during the summer, so tabouli is a staple in my fridge. This brand tastes good and is easy to make. Buying a case of this mix should keep me in tabouli through this summer!"
4,Casbah Tabouli,"I order this often, it is the best boxed Tabouli I have found, I would give it 5 stars but it is still not as good as the fresh stuff at 'Emily's'>"
5,What a fantastic huddle !,"After completing a remix album 'Music is Immortal' Rockers returned to the studio to produce this gem. Dub cranked spliff head turnaround. The music opens with a train rolling through a station and a journey through sound begins. Highlights include Farda P's deep 'Going Under', Phoebe Ones vocals on '90 degrees fuzzwalk' and Burt Bacarch mixed into 'Uneasy Skanking'. CD comes with mixman software so you can remix on your PC ! ..."
5,Great Fun!,"McHale and his merry band of tricksters are back for a third season of zany and whacky hijinks against their enemy! The Japanese? No, silly!! Captain Binghamton and his sycophantic sidekick, Carpenter! Gone is Happy (Gavin McLeod), but he is not missed--there are still enough Tricksters to keep things going.In this season, the episodes become much more creative--there are even several dream sequences. This results in more outlandish plots. But each one is a scream. The interplay between Binghamton (Joe Flynn--who played his role so over the top!) and Parker (Tim Conway--who is funny just to look at) is played to the hilt and is a joy to watch. This season is even better than before. The chemistry between all the characters is perfect. I think all the actors must have really enjoyed making this show.If you like silly, funny, clean shows, this is for you. It's good family fun. Sit back and get ready to bust a gut!"
4,Still funny after all these years,"Everyone likes a comedy that puts one over on authority figures. That probably goes back to the stoneage. In film, it goes atleast as far back as The Keystone Cops. In this case McHale`s band of pirates are getting under the skin of the navy. The navy, inthe form of Joe Flynn that is.To be truthful, by the 3rd season the series was getting just a bit worn. The 1st and 2nd seasons were better. I would give those5 stars instead of 4 as I gave this one. Still, with comedians of the caliber of Tim Conway and Joe Flynn, you really can`t gowrong."
4,A good book as well as a good product,"I'm using this book as the text for one graduate course representation theory. This book is written in a modern fashion. Very good to take a survey of modern treatment of group representation. Futon and Harris use notations from category theory. At some place, they also use vector bundle. They assume readers have been familiar with those things. Means the author assume a high start point. Read Michael Artin's algebra as well as S. Lang's Algebra before you start this one would help a lot.The book I received is very new - newer than I expected."
2,lewill98,"This product was so-so. The images are old and dull. Would have liked to see more marine life, with more color."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BY SAMMY,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC CD. THE FIRST TIME YOU HEAR ""A STRANGER IN TOWN"", YOU WILL BE SO GLAD YOU BOUGHT IT. AS USUAL, SAMMY BRINGS HIS OWN SPECIAL INTERPRETATION TO ANY SONG, AND THERE ARE A FEW GEMS HERE WRITTEN BY ANTHONY NEWLEY THAT SAMMY REALLY DOES JUSTICE TO."
3,somewhat dissapointed,I found it had excess of details on the individual battles and not enough on the causes and what was happening behind the lines in both Washington and Ritchmond
2,Just OK,"I was expecting so much from this series, but was mildly disappointed. Maybe I just judge it from my view point, but I think there are alot better series out there on this subject. As everything, roll the dice and decide for yourself."
3,Ultimate civil war series,This is a set of 2 dvd's and in some places it is quiet good. But in other places it gets slow and boring.. Will put you to sleep.. Not the best that I have ever seen
1,a cure for insomnia,"I have long had an interest in, and passion for the study of, the Civil War. I stumbled across this - figured $6.99 for a blu-ray, how bad could it be? Bad enough for me to take the time to post this review, that's how bad. Save your time AND your money."
1,Horrible and Bias presentation of the facts...Don't waste your money on this product,"I wish i could return this product and give it a zero star. It's that useless...Audio was totally useless, facts were not completely presented to give you the whole context and picture. It's clear the creator of this product had an agenda which was poorly presented in the audio and video.If you want to waste your money on poorly put together product with a ""biased"" presentation of facts this is the product for you. If not. Save your money!!!"
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst Civil War videos I have ever seen. I knew something was wrong when the opening scene was a distant Lincoln impersonator who lips were out of sync with the voice track. I couldn't watch this stinker which was nothing more than a long slide show of generic images with a narrator reading a voice track. It reminded me of a BAD history class when a teacher talked through a Powerpoint presentation. I don't know who gave this a good review, it must have been people who have a financial investment in the DVD. Please save your money."
5,Ultimate Civil War Series - 150th Anniversary Edition (DVD),"I just received my copy of ""Ultimate Civil War Series"" (150th Anniversary Edition) & am just blown away!Being a life-long student of that conflict, I am well-versed in the events presented in this series.I have yet to find any errors of facts, & they present an amazing amount of information in each 45 minute segment! If your not a serious student of history, I could see you getting bored with the commentary, but the visual effects generally complement the audio well. This isn't a cheesy documentary that was churned out for the sesquicentennial- the producers have given us a high-quality film at a bargain basement price, & I applaud their efforts!"
4,Movie,"Very informative on the Civil War, did not learn all of this in school, educational, my grandson loved this, not what they areteaching in school these days."
3,Not Bad for a Work Shoe,I love being able to wear black hightop Converse shoes at work but they're not as comfortable as they should be. It seems like the left shoe fits more comfortable than the right shoe. It's hard to find a comfortable steel toe shoe but this ranks amongst one of my most comfortable. Three stars because it's not the comfort of real sneakers but the search goes on for my comfortable steel toe.
1,Poor example of writing,"Very disappointing; not worth the money. I was dismayed this book was even taken up by a publisher. Each book in the 3 series worsened in plot and quality. Fragmented plot without explanations for major changes; no development. It was as if the only thing important was that the female lead end up with a man in her life to take care of her -- and you could spot the end coming from nearly page one. Contrast this with such incredible historical fiction authors such as Janet Gleeson -- who is meticulous in her development, research in historical accuracy, and yet truly manages to be wonderfully entertaining with characters that are so well developed, one feels as if each is personally known."
4,Hooked From First Paragraph,"I love the entire series! The first book was definitely my favorite and I waited anxiously for each of the others to be released. I enjoyed the elements of playfulness and tension that I found thru all three books. I found them very descriptive. I could envision the places, feel the scene, and smell the surroundings. I liked the difference from the same 'ole, same 'ole style that can feel so heavy sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I read them too, all of the authors who crank out books like they're baking cupcakes, somehow...but, it was this series that got me hooked on historic-Fiction. Have been searching for something like it ever since! I'm just a woman that likes to read...not a college professor, or even able to diagram a sentence...but I think maybe we read for different reasons and for me this is a series worth escaping into for a few hours!"
1,Poor quality,Sent binder as a gift and it has only been about two weeks and already the cover of the binder part is falling apart. Sleeves for CD's still seem ok. But I would not buy this product again and don't recommend it.
3,Not real leather!,This item is NOT real leather. But it works well as a portable CD/DVD case. It has added space for lables.
4,4.5 Stars,"Just what I was looking for. We already had 2 DVD shelving systems filled to bust and were not about to buy a 3rd. These really are a near perfect solution. They are the exact height of a standard DVD case and really do look awesome on our shelves. I looked at everything I could find out there and most of it either had the standard caselogic feel or was too bulky/tall to fit on our shelves. They only seem to have 2 extremely minor drawbacks.1) They only seem to come in black (brown would have fit our decor better) and color variety would help with organization (i.e. Blue for Disney; Red for Christmas ect.)2) While they do fit 24 discs, it's a tight squeeze and the album fans a bit. I think 20 will be the max I'll put in.Other than that I already have plans to purchase more."
2,NOT for dvds,I went looking for a dvd holder to hold are ever going movie/xbox game/baby movie collection. When I went back on to buy it I baught this one instead of the smaller one even though it says dvd/cd holder it does not hold the outer dvd covers and if you try to put the inserts or booklets from games in it it gets to stuffed even and wont close. witch only leaves the option of discs only with defeates the purpose of the dvd part of the holder. Even then with just the discs the cds easily fall out. The only reason why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because it is of good quality and if you are just wanting to store a few cds it would work for the prize but there are much better ones out there to buy.
5,doll house bathroom accessories,I love these accessories for my dollhouse bathroom. They could not be more perfect. I also love that you can hang the shelf and the mirror. My grandkids love playing with my dollhouse since there is so much they can do to pretend play.
3,QEP Diamond wheels,Wheel cuts smoothly with very little effort and chipping. Life is a little short when compared to similiar products
5,Amazing,"I don't have much to say about this album except that it is amazing. The sound is so unique, while at the same time grasping all the fundamentals that make a song sound good. Simple enough, it sounds good, like nothing I have heard, including other pinback albums. The non-linear songs are beautiful and I thank pinback for their masterful production."
5,Elmo's World Summer Vacation Rocks!,"My daughter absolutely loves this video. Even though we have several other Elmo's World DVDs, this is the one she clearly prefers. We have actually had to hide it to get a break from it. She will watch it over and over."
2,Exact clip from Sesame Street,"This DVD is just an extensive, exact clip from a 2nd half Sesame Street episode called ""Bookaneers (2007)"". I have TIVO and my 17-month old son loves Elmo so recorded episodes of Sesame Street is free and stored on DVR. Since this DVD was a 2008 release, I thought it was new but was disappointed to find out that I already have it recorded! I guess it's still good to have for grandma's or the babysitter's house but other than that, it's kind of boring and my son was not happy."
5,One of my son's favorites....,"Elmo's World - Summer Vacation covers beaches, skin, and cameras. I don't get how cameras specifically relate to summer, since I personally use cameras no matter what the season, but that segment has to be by far one of my two year-old son's favorite Elmo's World segments. He frequently requests to see that segment and has become fascinated with my camera collection.As a person who can burn easily, and my son inheriting my skin tone, I appreciate the attention given to skincare and proper sun protection. I've even found my son to be slightly more accommodating when I'm putting lotion on him. I hope his improved attitude continues because protection from the sun is important to me and I'm glad Elmo agrees!"
3,Consequences for a defected's spy's wife,"This is the story of a British wife/homemaker whose husband comes home unexpectedly, runs inside for a few things and then drives away, saying ""Sorry"" as he tears up one of her rosebushes. She finds out not much later that she has much more to be annoyed about than just the rosebush when she is visited by 2 officials who tell her that her husband is a Soviet spy. The book follows Molly's journey on how she deals with this revelation and how others around her are pushing her to take on their agendas. The British spy service wants her to work for them to root out her husband's contacts and possibly find him, and she has other challenges with a sick mother who is going into surgery, a dependent father, and a former fiancee, now married, who still wants her. The style is very British, but I liked how Molly becomes stronger and stands up for what she wants. The ending was a little unexpected, but not too unsatisfying."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I wondered why this book was not available in any library or bookstore I searched. Even here, on Amazon, it took awhile to find. Maybe the reason is that there is no demand for what's probably Hill's worst book. Expecting a Dalziel/Pascoe mystery, I picked up the book. No mystery. I was able to foresee the details of the plot before they unfolded. I read Hill for the wit (especially !), plot and characterization. Well, I gave two stars for the characterization. No wit, and an overloaded plot."
2,Disappointing...,The story was not well put together....the characters were not consistent in their behaviour. I am beginning to wonder if the publishers are not a vanity press. The book left me wanting my money back!
4,Highly satisfying yarn,"""The Spy's Wife"" is ostensibly a mystery story, but it turns out to be more of a character study--with the subject of the title front and center throughout. This turns the piece into something more than a typical Cold War espionage potboiler. The novel's focus is on Molly Keatley, the badly betrayed wife of an alleged British turncoat, who evolves from a relatively passive soul at the moment of her betrayal into an angry, anything-but-passive woman by the end of the book. The story moves to a surprising and highly creative ending.There is much humor and wisdom in this very enjoyable book. Highly recommended."
4,Just not my cup of tea,"I'm a huge fan of the Dalziel & Pascoe series, so this just didn't do it for me. But it was light and fun and very surprising at the end! And, as always, wonderfully written---he is such a great writer! I did enjoy it---just not overmuch."
4,A lesser known but far from minor book by Hill,"I did start this thinking that it wold be a slighter book than I'm used to from the author. efinitely not so. It is, as others have pointed out, more of a character study than an espionage thriller. However, it still shows the expected sardonic humor Reginald Hill uses to great advantage, and it does center n the title character's growing maturity as she reacts to the sudden knowledge that the man she married led a life she never suspected."
3,Dated and not ability oriented,"I tend to overlook the age of books before purchasing them, and this is yet another one of those follies. Aside from that, this book is an interesting read, though more personalized and biographical. I would pick this book up if you want to maybe gleam some personal concepts and perceptions from an insider, but don't think it's going to help your trading or undestanding too much. There are much better books for that."
4,Onkyo Speaker Stands (AS240B) Money Well Spent,The stands themselves were better than I expected. They are very sturdy. I also liked the weight of the stands. We have several pets and I am not worried about them knocking over the stands. My only dissapointment was the M4 screws that attach the base to the pipe. I ended up substituting high quality stainless steel screws to get a real good grip into the pipe threads.
2,Not sturdy,"The plastic tabs to hang speakers on break off easily, and you must purchase longer sturdier screws to attach base with. Not very good quality or design I'm afraid."
4,GO FOR THE SILVER!,"I purchased both the black and the silver stands. Each for different rooms. They both look great but the silver appear to look more professional. The silver stand and speakers go great with the Mitsubishi 73"" DLP I have because the frame is silver as well. The black stands and speakers go great with the Samsung LCD I have that is framed in black. Only drawback is the silver speakers only have 1 rear speaker while the black have 2 rear speakers. Therefore since the stands come in pairs, you wind up with an extra speaker stand with the silver speaker system"
1,These mounts are not very good,Speakers does not mount correct. Screws does not fit into the base either. Do not buy this set...
4,"Best price, fast delivery","Saved $100 buying online vs. discount national electronics store, easy choice and delivery was faster than expected."
2,"I love Ole, but this is my least favorite product","I'm 29, with fair, freckled combo skin. A few months ago, I got a mini of the Ole Henriksen Truth Serum and loved it, and when I saw the 3 Little Wonders set, I figured it would be great to try the other products as well as getting the full size Truth Serum.On application it's very tacky, which isn't a huge deal, but noticeable. Once I let it dry, Ole recommends that you apply sheer transformation(one of the products in the kit) over it. When doing that, it just became a mess and all the products rolled off. When I just used this gel on it's own, my face felt dry and tight, and later it flaked off my face. I tried all different things, applying less, applying more. Overall, I just didn't take to it. Out of the 3, it's the one I tend to avoid."
3,Don't know,I'm not sure if it made any difference. All I can say is that I had break outs that I never had before. I will stop using it for now.
3,just o.k.,"Don't get me wrong, I am the 'One and only,BIGGEST', Sonny Landham fan on this Earth! But here he and the other actors all seam a bit lost. Having a good or even fairly good script would have been a big help. Don't waist your money on this one! Sorry Sonny!"
2,This one could have been a lot better,"I thought that this book was cute and somewhat interesting, but not worth the price. It contains misstakes. It is also not very original. It is, at best, average."
2,Sacred but not a collectable,"I'm a Videographer and an editor with an eye for imagery. Beauty of course is a very subjective thing. This Blue Ray dvd Image is fine, but it wasn't my cup of Tea. Watched once and traded disc for 2 Bucks. There are many good dvd's out there, this one left me wanting...but of course if you worship this type of imagery get it !"
3,disappointing,"The photography is fine, but it is somewhat repetitive, and hardly worth viewing as a serious video. It's fine for keeping on in the background."
4,Wisdom that Counts,"Make Your Move provides practical Wisdom that counts. From making the most of each day to avoiding the pitfalls of procrastination there is help in this book for everyone. If you want time-tested ideas time warped to today's internet society, from a master of making things happen this is worth the read."
3,Personal Development 101,Basic review of the essentials of succdess in ones life.Not a detailed book but great for the initial process of personal development.Easy reading
5,A great read for everyone...,"This easy read is a guide to getting the most out of your life and a book I wish I could have read out of college (my first half of life...)Simple, easy ways to live and think- a great outline for life. I would compare this book to All The Gold in Babalon and Who Moved My Cheese-books anyone looking for life guides should read. Jimmy Calano does a great job sharing his life and the life of others to show you how to open your mind to maximize and enjoy your life."
5,Giving Clarity for my Move,"Mr. Calano's writing gave clarity to my ""Move"". I was unhappy in a profitable, but yet unsatisfying business of developing commercial real estate. After reading his work I began to realize that I could and should ""Make My Move"" into the business I really loved since boyhood (investment analysis). Thank you Mr. Calano for waking me up and motivating me to take the steps required to achieve a rewarding and complete life."
2,Pro-Soviet,This book is by no means a well balanced history book as a reviewer has claimed. All major characters stressed in the book were all pro-Soviet sympathizers. Those who opposed the pro-Soviet view are viewed as opponents of FDR's foreign policy. I would welcome a really well balanced foreign policy study of FDR. But I'm not holding my breath considering the disposition of our academia.
1,Probably not what you are looking for,"This book is the student solutions manual for Blitzer's 2nd edition of ""College Algebra"", not the 3rd edition wich is probably what you are looking for. If you need the 3rd edition you will probably have to buy it from your college book store."
5,Just What I Needed,This remote device works perfectly. I'm disabled and have great difficulty moving around the house. This device is a godsend.
1,Not very reliable,"This is a fine indoor unit, but it also supposed to work outside. If you somewhere warm and where it doesn't rain, maybe you can get it to work outside, otherwise, don't waste your money."
3,Dead batteries,"Dead batteriesI bought two of these switches to use to turn off my Airport Extreme gigabit modem and the original Airport Extreme. It allows me to turn the modems on and off in the motels I stay in frequently without actually going into the motels and bothering the owners. I turn the modems off during the day so they won't burn out in the extremely hot room I had to put them in and it also allows me to turn them off when I'm not there.However, I never would have known they worked all four batteries were dead. Fortunately the last one had a little life left in it but I don't expect it to last long. Unfortunately the batteries are very expensive. So be aware.John"
5,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,I have this switch to control an amplifier for the TV sound. It works great! I can turn it off and on from anywhere in the house. I have not found a spot where it does not work. Much better than an infra red remote. Buy with confidence.
1,Broke 48 hours after purchase,"Plug it in and it worked great, until it blew out the next day. What a rip off."
3,"Great Looking, Quality = So-So","I bought this watch because I wanted something flashy for the sake of flashy. It's a great looking watch. The visual fit and finish is spot on. I greatly enjoyed wearing it for a year. Then I noticed that the watch hands are loose and visually ""rattle around"".While this is not an uber-expensive watch, the cheapest made quartz watches I own don't have insecure hands that rattle about, I expected that this watch also would not have hands that rattle about."
2,difficult to get started,"This MB does not come with a power cord for a serial drive. The drivers included with the MB will cause windows XP to stop working, due to missing a system file. There is information about this at the nVidia website. You will not be able to install WindowsXP if you are using a serial hard drive unless you know to hit F6 quickly when given the chance during the install of the Operating system, then install the drivers for the serial drive from a floppy, which you make from the driver disk, look for Bootdrv.exe on the disk. This motherboard will not operate with two strips of 512 pc3200 memory, in spite of what the manual says. Customer support at gigabyte seems to be in another country and does not understand any of these problems. I have returned my first MB and the second has exactly the same problems. From the web it appears many others have problems with nVidia drivers for different products"
4,DANDY LYNN MERIDETH,"No, not Dandy Don- Lynn Merideth is dandy on his own merits. Fabulous vocalist brings life to the Livgren tunes. The Livgren tunes are not as crisp as their previous effort but still pretty good. Livgren is always worth listening to but he's even better with a good vocalist such as Dandy Lynn Merideth and Steve Walsh. Proto Kaw is keeping the 70's spirit alive and well. Keep up the great work Kerry- we love it! How ironic it is that Kansas is once again about to release yet another compilation album...this is silly. I'm glad that Kerry continues to write vibrant, progressive music!!! WAKE UP KANSAS!!!!!"
4,LIVGREN GOES FROM ELSEWHERE TO HERE,"I like all the Kansas albums that feature STEVE WALSH. I also love the Steve Walsh album GLOSSALALIA (if you don't have it you should get it). However, I have never been a fan of the solo work of Kerry Livgren. While with Kansas his writing was some of the best I just couldn't get into the solo albums. However, after the reunion album of the original Kansas lineup on Somewhere to Elsewhere, with Livgren writting all the music, I was again a fan. So I took a chance on this album. WAIT OF GLORY is a good album with strong songs. It reminds me a bit of Spocks Beard, perhaps that is the ""spiritual element"" of the lyrics. There is some Kansas like music as well and a bit of early King Crimson like stuff. Yet it doesn't sound dated either.So I would say if you like Somewhere to Elsewhere by Kansas you would like this. If you like spocks beard, though I have only heard one of their albums, I bet you would like this too. My TWO CENTS WORTH."
5,Great listening music.,Kerry Livgren is back with music that has a classic retro Kansas sound. I love the sound that this band is putting out. I want more!
2,Not All That,We purchased this to help us out with a Chili Cookoff but when it came in it was very small about the size of the purse size Bible but not as thick. Also the holes were punched through some of the words or measurements. I would have not purchased this had I known it was going to be so cheap and the recipes were not all that either. Most of the recipes required things that I was unable to find and some of the things it called for were just way to expensive. I would go with something else that concentrated on Chili besides this book.
3,Very small book,This is a cute book but I should have checked the size more carefully - it is very small!
2,Championship Chili: Top Cookoff Winning Recipes,"Really couldn't get very excited about this ""Booklet""Didn't feel like there was real substance to it....Would not spend my money to purchase it if I had it inhand to look at first."
2,Dropped the Ball,"I enjoy this series, but I can not understand this book. I was very diappointed aftere waiting months for this book and to be given a book that doens't even end well. I understand that there has to be yet another book but to go 400 plus pages and just end. I was upset that once the story showed signs of life and the next page just ends. I know of no other book that ends as poorly as this book did. I could be entirely wrong and the sister book to this book is total awesome but next time I wil wait until it comes out in softback instead of getting it as soon as it hit the stories as I hae for the last books."
3,a disappointment,"I realize that sometimes it is necessary for an author to set up a whole detailed background and backdrop for his characters to exist in, but 400 plus pages of it? This is the first book of the Recluce series that really let me down. I think Modesitt does an excellent job of letting his readers get into the heads of his characters (as usual), but considering how expensive hardcover books are becoming, you would like to see at least a little action in a four hundred page novel. I expect the next novel will be the one where things really start happening for Lorn (and of course I will buy and read it), but I think it might better have served Modesitt's fans to have combined this book and the next one coming up into one really large book."
4,A pre-prequel,"The book was a little slow, but i enjoyed the world -- the kingdom before Recluce. Would enjoy more books about this time period. Also would like to see the different eras tied together more."
3,"Ok, so I was disappointed, but it's still a good book","Ok, this book enters yet another era of the war between chaos and order.with the conclusion of cerryl the white mage in the lsat book I was looking forward to another good read, and hey it was. But did Modesitt write this or just provide the idea? The language changed as did the entire style, though the world and ideas are still right up the alley of the former recluce books.An overall good read, but alas the other books are better. I just hope that I wont be as dissapointed when I read Scion of Cyador..."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Delving back into this world's past again, Modesitt takes a look at Cyador's reign. A young wizard, Lorn, is sent out to deal with some far flung border skirmishes, to get him out of the city. Taking a leaf from the old people of Recluce's book, it seems. He leaves a woman behind, who has to deal with her own struggles.The politics of the White city still cause him problems."
4,Magi'i of Cyandor,"I was reading a well written book and had three others waiting when I came across this book. I've been enchanted with this author since I read his first three publications now in a single volume. I was not disappointed, except as one reviewer wrote that one could have wished the publisher could have included the second half of the story in the one jacket."
2,More of the same,"While I cannot say that I will stop reading Modesitt's books, since the background settings are often very interesting, I will stop buying them until he can think up another plot. The plot of this book is identical to that of ""The White Order"" except for background differences that are not crucial. Each of the thirteen or so ""Recluce"" books make the point that growing up is difficult--I believe we've all got the message by now.It would also help if the elaborate maps at the front of the book contained the locations of the story. The Cyador stories are set at a far earlier series time than the ones for which these maps were drawn."
2,The worst book in the series.,"This book was just barely good enough to keep me from setting it aside, which is sad, considering I've read all the other books in the series. The most annoying aspect is that the entire book is written in the passive voice. It isn't ""Lorn walked to the door"" - it's ""Lorn walks to the door"". I ended up feeling very detached from whatever little action there was in the book. Its a big investment of time to read that many pages, and you get very little return."
3,"Wonderful piece, poor performance","Allan Pettersson's Seventh Symphony is his most well known and is (rightly) popular. I shall not go into detail about the piece as other reviews have done this well, but I'll shall make a brief statement about the recording.Look elsewhere. This isn't even competitive. The ensemble is often sloppy, the recording quality fuzzy, the chosen tempi unbalanced. After buying this recording, I quickly went out to buy the wonderful Dorati performance for a far superior disc. This disc is also hardly generous with no couplings unlike the other Pettersson 7 CD releases.Brilliant piece which is a must hear for everyone. Just don't hear it off this disc."
2,"Maximum Security, Minimum Mystery","Rose Connors's Maximum Security is a legal thriller that just doesn't cut the mustard.The story is OK but there is little mystery here. Defense lawyer Marty Nickerson represents her boyfriend's old flame who is charged with murdering her husband for insurance.The story's course is pretty predictable and it is not hard to figure out who really did the killing. No big surprises there. There is really no sideplot to speak of.Connors is a lawyer herself and the court scenes are authentic and fairly interesting. A positive in the book is some humor exhibited throughout by the author. Perhaps she should be a standup comedian. Are lawyers really that funny?If you like legal thrillers, stick with John Grisham, Scott Turow or Lisa Scottoline. Much better writers. Connors has written other novels, but on the strength of this one, I doubt I will bother reading them.James A Anderson, AuthorDEADLINE"
3,entertaining,It is a good light reading. Considering that practically nothing of significance happens until the very end of the book - it is surprisingly non-annoying.
2,Not very comfortable,"They feel very cheap and flimsy as the sound quality isn't the greatest. Also, when wearing them and sitting at the same time, it can become uncomfortable."
1,Nikon Quality,Amazon replaced the original Coolpix P3 because of technical defects but the new one has worst problems. This one does not even focuses at all.I dont know what to do now because there is no technical service for nikon in my country Venezuela or Latin America. I basicly lost my 300 dollarsPlease answer
3,Nikon CoolPix,"Not being a digital camera kind of person, this is easy to use, and takes very good photos. However, I don't like not having a viewfinder. Using only the screen drains batteries quickly. Constantly turning it off to preserve battery life results in not having it ready when needed.Using this camera in the sun is difficult if you are wearing polarized sunglasses.The selector button moves too easily from setting to setting, resulting in the camera possibly not ready to use once turned back on if it has been put into a pocket."
3,Great Camera but consider skipping the wifi option,"I'll leave the photo reviews to the web-sites....I'm troubled by the wifi...1st is just a really silly limitation...it can't talk to a host that isn't on wireless...I understand that it wants a fixed SSID and a fixed host but that host having to be on wireless? Stupid! My desktop can't see the WAP - it's on regular ethernet...And therefore, the camera can't see it and can't be set-up properly.2nd is a feature I knew was missing in advance but drives me nuts...why can't it attach to WAPS on the fly? Post picts to a blog? To a public site?In sum, I was hoping that the wifi feature would make life easier and, for me, a very, very experienced networking person, it hasn't....But it still takes great pictures!"
3,Did not work for my roses,"This product did not work on my roses at all.I bought it to keep blackspot under control, but they caught it really bad anyway. It was like the product didn't even scratch the surface of the disease. It did work, however, on my perennials."
2,Meh,"I bought this product to get rid of powdery mildew on some of my plants. It didn't seem to work very well. A simple combination of water, baking soda and detergent worked better for me. I will try it again if I have a problem next season, because first impressions aren't everything."
3,like it says tomatoes....,"if u grow MMJ not good.. move on, it suppresses mold, it doesn't cure it, craeful with cap is thin and brittle."
1,Poor results,Sprayed healthy tomatoe plants with Serenade as directed on bottle. 4-5 days later plants showed signs of disease. Had to use another type of disease control to stop the disease. The plants had stayed healthy when using a different type of disease control. I am not sure that I will use this product again.
2,Don't know what was in the package,"I received this product wrapped in a thick plastic bag and then a couple of mailing bags. When I unwrapped it, it had leaked all in the bag because the cap was broken and the was no seal on the bottle. Someone could have poured anything in there and I wouldn't have known what it was. The product might have been good but the sender really screwed up. Don't buy anything from these people."
1,problems,didnt work to good for me but haveent tried sence adding dehumdifier to my 8x4 grow tent sense it so humid cause it always raining my humdidy spiked up when my 1000w tuers off but so for the baking coda works good so for thins is it cant sit over night which means you waste some of it but will give another update in a few days on this product again
3,Very Well Written,This was an intersting read.Very well written and I liked it on the whole.The only disapoinment was I found the ending but other then that it was great.
4,Very entertaining and highly enjoyable reading,"As a ""Phantom"" fan, I found this to be thoroughly enjoyable. A couple of twists made the ending a bit of a surprise. Thanks to Sam Siciliano who brought Michael Crawford's version of the Phantom to life and gave us an ending his Phantom deserved!"
3,Interesting retelling of 2 widely known stories,"This adaptation of 2 famous novels finds a deeper, more feeling Holmes, sans Watson. The new Holmes is unlike ACD ever imagined. Although the plot is familiar, there is spark enough to keep interest afloat. I enjoyed the work for what it is: a combination of two stories with certain liberties taken in both, yet enough familiarity to keep most enthusiasts happy. True devotees of the ACD Canon may not approve."
4,"Oh, dear.........","The characters, the plot, and the writing style are all exellect, but poor Watson has yet again been trashed by Sherlock spin-offs. Flms have already made him an 'incorrigable bungler,' now Moriarty and Watson and Holmes' friendship have been uncerimoniously kicked out the door. I wonder what Sir Doyle would say..."
5,Amazing!,"With the rise of the doom/sludge/stoner genre to prominence it seems that Place of Skulls would get more notice. Yet they seem to remain in the cult status the members former bands were in. Hardcore fans revere them but those finding bands like Wolfmother, Black Stone Cherry and others should be checking POS out to really hear the genre done right. Griffin loves the stop start effect of going heavy to light sonically and the vocals fit the overall mood perfectly. The Black Sabbath influence is extremely heavey with dashes of Trouble and even some Deep Purple moments added for variety. I wonder too, if the lyrical content is turning some off as Griffin is writing from a christian world view nowadays, albeit, mostly allegorical. I'd say any fan of aforementioned bands as well as all the ones the former members have been in will love this musically and the lyrics should not stop any fan from enjoying the high quality this band represents."
2,Not worth it,"I was very disappointed on the content of this book compared to the cost. There are better sock knitting books for one-half the cost that have multiple sock sizes, great graphics, colored photos and easy to read charts and instructions. The publisher should have allowed us to see inside the book - something missing on so many knitting books on this site! The 2 needle technique is very interesting but not worth the price of the book. Check it out at your local library."
1,too much fluff,"I learned how to knit socks on two circulars several years when this technqiue was new. The book is a waste of time since Cat is so chatty about peanut butter and her needle theories rather than giving you step by step directions to knit socks. For anyone who likes a cook book method to learn to knit, this book will be annoying. It makes you want to take a highlighter to distinguish the sock technique from the chatter."
4,Never going back!!!,"As an avid knitter who avidly hates double pointed needles, this book made my day (year, decade). I'm not much of a sock knitter, but I was able to understand the directions for the basic socks and the leaf and tendril--both patterns knitted up quickly and beautifully.The real gem of the book is the first 5 pages where the technique is explained. This technique works for any pattern where dpns are called for. I've used it on sweater sleeves, hats and purses. I'll never use dpns again!!!This book definatly pays for itself--even if you never knit any of the patterns."
2,"nice patterns, but no cigar","This book had nice patterns, but I already knew the technique from Joyce Williams and I have a preference for knowing how to adjust for different sizes and different fibers."
4,sock knitting,"The ideas to knit socks its not so new, but what is super great! the knitting with 2 cicular needles, you're faster than with five needles, you don't waste time, that' s the great to own this book"
4,Not for the abject beginner,"This book sounded to me like it would work for the never-knitted-a-sock-and-want-to-avoid-all-those-double-pointeds kind of knitter such as myself. After puzzling over it at length, I've decided that A)it's written for the folks who've already struggled through a pair of socks on the DPNs, and B) I'm going to ask my accomplished knitter friend to explain to me what the book is talking about (in which case I could have just asked her and saved myself the expense of the book.)As an aside, I was surprised at the number of typographical errors.Nice idea, but if you're a beginner, GET HELP!"
4,circular sock knitting,Fabulous and easy to follow . It's just like having some one sitting there talking you through the knitting and making you smile!
4,Circular socks book,I just received this book and I think it is easy to understand. I have been wanting to knit socks for a long time but could never manage the double-pointed needles. Now I am knitting socks! This book is great for beginners. The patterns in the book range from simple to elegant and dainty. It even shows you how to interpret regular sock patterns and translate them on the two circular needles.
4,Socks Soar!,"The instructions are easy to follow and the technique is very workable.The patterns in the book are not very exciting, but you can adapt other patterns to the technique."
3,Book Is Not For Beginners,I don't feel that Socks Soar on Two Circular Needles...is for a beginner. It more or less just makes statements and assumes you understand what is being said.
2,Got very confusing,"I'm an intermediate beginner, I guess. I've succesfully made mittons, for instance. I had attempted to knit socks in the past but the DPNs were too frustrating for me. At first, I was going gung-ho on my first sock using this book but I got thoroughly confused after constructing the heel, about how to pick up the stitches and finish the sock. The directions were really vague and unclear (at least to me, a novice sock knitter) and I couldn't figure out how to translate traditional sock knitting instructions from my other books to this technique. The author makes a lot of assumptions about what a novice knitter would know. You will need other books to figure out her instructions. It was extremely disappointing. I've since purchased bamboo DPNs in hopes that there will be less yarn slippage and frustration with the old-fashioned method.If the author revised the text to include more thorough explanations this would be a good buy."
5,Great Book,"This book has great patterns for knitting socks on two circular needles, and I am excited too try them all. You do need to have some knitting experience or a knitting reference as the patterns do assume knitting knowledge, but they are well written."
1,Socks not soaring,"This is probably the hardest book to follow I have ever seen. I work in yarn shop so I have seen some of the worst knitting books and this book is one that you will only be able to understand if you have someone who can show you step by step what to do because the book does not give satisfactory directions or even decent pictures to see what you are supposed to do. I would suggest that if you want to learn this method to get ""Knitting Circles Around Socks"", it is one of my favorites."
3,So-So,"I just started knitting & finally decided to try socks--assuming that this book was the end all for circular sock knitting. Everyone seemed to rave about it. I found it confusing and hard to follow. More patterns than directions--and the photos showing the various steps weren't very helpful, as you got a beginning and an end result and were left to figure out the middle based on the author's written word. It probably would be a better book for people who already knew how to do socks on DPNs but this wasn't set up for the beginner or newbie sock knitter."
4,Friendly tone. Nice introduction,"I am brand new to sock knitting but have already learned that I don't love DPNs, so knitting socks on circular needles holds great appeal. This book has some helpful instructions and attractive patterns. I am finding it to be a good purchase. It is slender for it's cost."
3,Not my favorite,"I bought this book because I prefer knitting socks with two circulars and thought I might garner some additional info about how to knit using this method. I bought this book at the same time that I bought Sensational Knitted Socks. I prefer SKS better. Cat Bordhi has a very unique writing style, one that I don't really enjoy. This ""book"" is more like a pamphlet - the inside is printed only in black and white. The text needs better editing."
1,Unbelievably obtuse,"Man oh man, I love this woman and her hippieness.... BUT, this book has like 2... maybe 2 and a half illustrations on how to actually DO this technique!Two illustrations for the actual technique, and the rest pics of fancy arse socks???Forget this!! I've a better method to knit socks on just one small circumference circular needle!There is absolutely NO instruction on how to do this two-needle method! How did this book get published, and HOW do many of the knitting mavens praise this book highly??Very disappointed.. In fact, I'll give this book away to anyone who wants it... maybe for an old ball of sock yarn."
3,Need a cleaner publication,"This looks to be a self-published book. Although the technique is catching on with a lot of sock knitters, it would benefit the author to get the book professionally published in a neater, cleaner format. The crudness of the text is distracting to learning the technique."
2,There are better instructions on the web.,"The book may be worth buying for its patterns, but if you are only interested in learning the technique, there are better instructions on the web (search for knitting with two circular needles)."
3,Not the right book for me.,"By the time this book arrived, I'd already found a free online tutorial showing how to knit socks on two circular needles. I was hoping to use the sock patterns, but most are written only for a women's medium foot--too small for me, too big for my kids. And, although I've successfully resized patterns in the past, these are written in such a way that I haven't been able to figure out how to do that. I'm curious enough about the ""turned toe"" technique that I may just make one according to her directions to see how it's done, then figure out how to resize it for my big feet. But it would be nice to be able to start with the right size. Basically, this was the wrong book for me--doesn't mean it won't be useful for someone else, but I was disappointed."
3,Better for Experienced sock knitters,"I found some of the instructions very confusing and difficult to follow. If I'd made socks before, it probably would have been very clear, but since I'm a novice, it was quite a challenge. I had to use 3 other sock instruction books to figure out how to interpret her directions."
4,Superb but a few additional words would help...,"I adore this book. I had never knit socks before getting this book. However, without the help of some of my knitting friends in an online knitting forum, I wouldn't have made it...and I'm NOT a new knitter.I think a few extra black & white pictures like those provided on pp. 4 & 5 would be extremely helpful. BTW..the pix that are included are VERY clear and VERY helpful! But a few more would help to clarify some of the trickier points for we visual learners! Additionally, if you aren't familiar with sock terminology and the location of the gusset, instep, etc., you'll need to find it elsewhere.All in all, I wouldn't trade the book for anything!"
1,Overpriced for what you get,"I'd heard so much about this book that I was looking forward to buying it, and then I had a chance to look it over at a yarn shop.I was very disappointed. The book is more like a thin magazine (like only 50 pages), and it looks like someone printed it at home on a computer, then took it to a copy shop. You have to go back and forth between the cover and the directions, and as you can tell from the cover, they are not large color pictures.I also found the directions difficult to understand, which wasn't good either. They are very chatty and could use more and better illustrations.As another reviwer has already mentioned, the two-circular needle technique you can find instructions for on the web, and you could probably use it with the directions for the toe-up socks (or top-down, for mittens) in Anna Zilboorg's Fancy Feet or (mittens) in Magnificent Mittens..."
4,great,"its a great book. author funny. looking for toe up cicular book,but this shows cuff down on ciculars."
3,Socks Soar,"Engaging description of relatively new technique taking advantage of the flexibility of circular needles. Good starter project patterns, good photos."
3,Missing toe up socks,"I raced to my local yarn store completely prepared to purchase this book - and didn't buy it. Why? Because I'd already learned how to knit on two circular needles (this information is available on many websites). And I already have plenty of patterns for knitting socks from the top down. I was really hoping that this book would have the courage to focus on socks that start at the toe but it didn't.Bottom line - if you don't have many sock patterns and haven't been able to learn the two circular method off the net, than this book is probably a good resource to own. Otherwise, try to look at it and judge if you need it. That caveat aside, knitting on two circular needles is absolutely wonderful and well worth learning!"
1,Disapointing,"Poor pictures, a very slim book and lots of shortcuts in the quality department made this a big disapoinment. This one's worth the trip to the Post office to return."
5,wow!,"This was absolutely fabulous -- I've given it to all my female friends. I can't recommend it highly enough -- it's sexy without being offensive, and full of smart, doable advice. She's tried it all so that we don't have to!"
3,Untill the real thing comes along,To start off with I was disappointed to find so many typo's in this second edition. While annoying it doesn't spoil the reading experience. The extensive use of long sections of quotation from other sources is far worse. This may not be intended as filler material but it does break the flow with unfortuate regularity. There is much in the way of interesting personal information that is not included. This is not difficult to source as I found it easily at a couple of on-line bio's.The lack of a definitave biogaphy of Levi is a glaring omission in Occult literature. While this book doesn't fill the void it's the only one available. Worth reading untill the real thing comes along.
3,Good book,"The ""Generation"" is a very good book on the Ethiopian Student movement. It gives one a good account of the student movement of the sixties and the seventies. However, it is a bit biased as Mr Tadesse writes from the perspective of a former EPRP member. It is also somewhat disorganized. I still do think that it is worth reading, however. For those of you who can read amharic, I recommend Andargachew Assegid's, BACHIR YETEQECHE REJEM GUZO (MEISON TARIK). It gives the MEISON side of the story with a great historical analysis of the causes for the revolution."
3,"Bought for 1 song, but suprised","Origionally bought for ""We Follow a Star""(so haunting and wonderful)and found out that the rest was very pleasant also. Was VERY happy to have found the CD, had been looking for it FOREVER and had about given up.Thank you, Amazon!!!!!"
5,From the Heart and Soul...,"As a Physical Therapist for over 30 years, I've seen hundreds of patients suffering though the pain and frustrations of recovery. The fact is, their care-givers and loved ones suffer too. Stephanie's book is a powerful tool to help those people and any others who are impacted by the suffering of a loved one who faces physical pain and/or discouraging prognoses.Thank You Stephanie"
5,Helping the Helper,"The Helping Handbook specifically ""helps"" family and friends deal with a medical crisis -- often for the first time. Patients frequently tell me that it feels like ""This has all been a mistake. But it isn't. I don't know what to do."" Caring for seriously ill loved ones require multiple and ongoing decisions, comfort, research, interventions with medical staff and on and on. What most of us don't realize is that the family and helpers need support too. Ms. Waxman offers insights and ""prompts"" to help readers help themselves, and in so doing, they can better bear their crisis and be as effective as possible at a most difficult time. I have given this book to hospice workers, patients and family. I recommend it to you. Dr. Candace De Puy"
1,"Great movie, bad copy","I have the VHS copy of this movie, but thought the DVD would be better. Not.Some of the scenes are so dark you can't make out the surroundings, or even the characters, and I know it wasn't that dark in the VHS copy.The beginning was cut off as well as there was/is a picture of the book and a drawing, but this only showed it for 5 seconds, and they added some cut scenes at the beginning that just seemed out of place, sort of a transition screen that really wasn't needed.I mostly just listened to the movie as the video was so dark at times, and I don't mean the caves or night scenes.I'm going to see if I can get one of those programs that copies VHS to a computer, and burn a new DVD myself and just keep the casing for it."
2,If you think this CD is funny... you might be a redneck.,"This is a ""music"" album by Jeff Foxworthy. Actually, most of the ""songs"" feature jokes from his standup comedy performances, set to a musical background. Jeff only actually sings on ""Redneck 12 Days of Christmas"" and ""Copenhagen"", which is an inferior cover version of aGeezinslawssong. (Bet you didn't know that. See, that's helpful right there!) On many of the musical tracks backing up his comedy, they actually got well known musicians to sing a chorus, like Alan Jackson and the Beach Boys. Unfortunately, I don't find Jeff Foxworthy to be all that funny, but if you do, you will probably like this CD. I have to admit that I do find the two Christmas tracks to be pretty funny."
5,Charming Chamber Compositions,"Abel was a close friend of the painter, Thomas Gainsborough. Today, Gainsborough is well-remembered as a painter, but Abel is all but forgotten as a composer. That is indeed unfortunate, for his compositions, such as the six presented on this CD, are worthy of being heard and being enjoyed. It has long been my belief that there is a significant number of composers whose works are underservedly ignored. Abel is such a composer, and this CD is an appropriate vehicle to help lift him from that obscurity."
2,"A ""B"" Movie with Charlie Sheen","This movie sucks. The special effects suck, the sound effects suck, the music sucks. Some of the acting is ok, I guess. I didn't make it through. I couldn't handle an XR dirtbike making electronic two stroke noises. When the car chasing sheen ""lost it's steering"" and then you could see the charge under the car fire to flip it over, I quit. Wow, this is a BAD movie."
2,old,just very low budget I am spoiled by today's movies this movie is B grade at best i would not waste my time on this one!
4,We wanted to better understand the Clintons :{,"My wife and I read books to each other and ""Partners in Power"" gave us reason to continue. At first Mr. Morris painted the President's boyhood as one full of poverty, abuse and instability yet his drive to gain power began early in his life. We enjoyed stopping and discussing potential reasons for his behavior as governor and president. We found his boyhood stifled and bland until he became entwined in draft evasion. The decline of his values continue as the book outlines his climb to the presidency. We know of Dan Lasater here in Northern New Mexico. We heard his low-flying cargo plane, and pass his airport that our state government helped him build. Critically, I did not get a good understanding of the President and Mrs. Clinton as PEOPLE. The book didn't do this for me. I do, however, recognize his disarming style of ""telling stories"""
2,Roger Morris' Fiasco,The title and pictorial representation leads one to believe that the book would share some light on the past and present exploits of the Clinton's political arranegements. However the book is in fact a catalog of ramblings about unsubstantiated charges of corruption at all levels of government. Additionally an inordinate portion of the text is dedicated to the struggles the Clintons went through in their early lives. It also goes off on tangents that only remotely relate to the Clinton's felonious life style. To the interested student of power brokers this book is replete with redundancies that leads to a boring and sophomoric exercise.
1,Republican Party Propaganda,"His title sounds convincing for the evidence he sugests has already been proven to be fabricated lies, this is pure dirty political propaganda from the republican party propaganda machine."
5,Wife and kids love it.,"-great form factor-was easy to upgrade RAM-17"" screen is sharp, no dead pixels and bright-OSX operating system is dependable and easy to use-The buit in camera and mic work great with Skype and playing around with Photobooth software.-This was bought to replace a Mac mini hooked up to an old CRT monitor-The Core2Duo is noticably faster. We are very pleased with this system and with Amazon's price."
3,Phone looks better than it performs,"Great looking phone. Sound is borderline, not bad, but not good either. Cordless range is great. Missing nice features like ""Mute"" button. Broke within two weeks. I sent it back and decided to break down and buy thePanasonic KX-TG6021M 5.8 GHz Cordless Telephoneinstead. Should have just bought this one to begin with, however, I really did not want another silver phone as I already have 3 of the silver Panasonic Cordless phones for my home line. I wanted something to distinguish to two lines.The KX-TG602 has much better sound quality including the speaker phone, same range, and includes the missing ""mute"" button. The big difference is it a Panasonic. Panasonic phones just work! I have tried everything, Uniden, Vtech, GE and Panasonic, but I keep going back to Panasonic when it comes to wireless phones.I know every company has it's lemons, I just seem to get them with every other brand except Panasonic."
5,Great Book,"I have read many books on Sendero Luminoso. This is one of the best. Some of the contributers are genious. If you have any interest in the war in Peru from 1980 to 1995, you simply must read this book."
4,different perspectives paint complete picture,stern does a great job in collecting essays that tell the story of the rise and fall of the shining path... I had mcuh fun reading this book.
3,"Kind of vanilla, for the kiddies.","I realized it when the Rubber Pants Commandos came to the rescue and were blasting evil doers with squirts of milk. I liked Sam and Max more when they would fire off a few rounds at their prey while telling them to ""come here"" and they ""only wanted to talk."" No guns allowed here though, since a kid might get the idea that firing off a few rounds at their prey while telling them to ""come here"" and they ""only wanted to talk"" is funny."
1,WEAK!!!!!,I listened to this CD and was frustrated from the begining to the end. The songs on this album could have been good. Unfortunatly the high pitch whiny noise Paula makes when she tries to hit high notes she can not possibly reach is distracting and anoyying. In short making this pretty good album frustrating and just really bad.
3,it's okay,"yea the singles were good: i don't want to wait and ""cowboys"". I liked hush hush and me. Best song on the album: Feelin' Love, it's very sensual and it sounds strange and first but grows on you"
2,Mediocre at best,"I was very disappointed with this album. Someone told me that since I like Sarah Mclachlan I would like Paula Cole. WRONG! Cole's music is highly derivative of Mclachlan's but Cole is not in her class as a singer or musician. I can't stand the ""Do-Do-Do"" background vocal which crops up on several of the tracks. Most of the songs come off like empty-headed, hypersensitive fluff made by someone who is trying to be overly arty. There is one striking exception -- on ""I Don't Want To Wait,"" Cole sounds inspired and her vocal cuts straight into the heart of the song. My advice: buy the single, skip the album."
2,Undeserved Grammy,"I will grant you that Paula Cole has an astonishingly haunting and magical voice. She has the true gift to convey such power and emotion using her voice, something so many vocalists sorely lack; however (you knew it was coming) this album lacks any real power. A few of the tracks have punch (""Where Have All The Cowboys Gone"" and ""I Don't Want To Wait"") but most of them seem empty. I can't help but listen to her voice and feel that this album could have been so much more!!"
4,I love some of paula cole songs,I like a few of paula cole songs on this cd where the cowboys gone. I don;t want to wait to our lives are over thats about it.
4,Unexpected Greatness; One Of The Best Albums With A Female Vocalist!,"On October 15, 1996, Paula Cole released her sophomore album entitled ""This Fire."" The album, which was entirely self-produced, contains eleven solid tracks that sound like a hybrid of Alanis Morissette and Sarah McLachlan. Below, please find the rating for each song individually:Tiger - 8/10Where Have All The Coyboys Gone? - 7/10Throwing Stones - 9/10Carmen - 8/10Mississippi - 8/10Nietzsche's Eyes - 9/10Road To Dead - 7/10Me - 10/10Feelin' Love - 8/10Hush, Hush, Hush (Featuring Peter Gabriel) - 8/10I Don't Want To Wait - 10/10"
3,Sounds Dated,"Paula Cole deservedly won a great deal of critical acclaim when her second CD THIS FIRE was released back in 1996. At the time, I really loved the first three singles - ""Where Have All the Cowboys Gone,"" ""I Don't Want to Wait,"" and ""Me."" I liked the overall CD too and listened to it quite a few times (I probably would have given it 4 stars then). After not listening to the CD for a few years, I played it today and found that it doesn't hold up particularly well. The singles still sound great, but too many of the other songs sound very mid-90's. I couldn't help but think of the now-defunct Lillith fair, and this CD seems stuck in that period. Paula sounds more than ever like a really angry Jewel. If you love in that style and from that period, you'll probably love this CD. Don't get me wrong, Paula is still talented. I hope that her next release will be a hit, but this CD sounds kind of lackluster in retrospect."
3,Typical sophmore effort,"As with many artists, Paula Cole sort of lost her way on this second album. Although it apparently pleased the folks who give out Grammy's, I don't find myself liking it anywhere near as much as her first album."
2,annoying,I rarely write in bad reviews but some of the other reviewers suggesting that men panned this because it is feminist is a bit offensive. Why would we have bought the CD if we are bigots? The reason for so many bad reviews is because its not very good. Its that simple.
3,An Artist Who Stubbornly Refuses to Play to Her Strengths,"The only commercial success Paula has had was with two mellow ballads from this CD. It is obvious she personally prefers much different music. Thus, we have a singer who is at war with herself. I saw her in concert at a Lake Tahoe casino (in 2000), even with free tickets to high rollers the room was only one-third filled. The music industry is terribly unforgiving and now her career has stalled because she ignored her commercial strength and released an odd CD (""Amen"") with an uneven religious (perhaps to make up for 15 years of excesses on the road?) and soul influence. The years 96/97 have been proven to be a temporary window for several female artists to get their 15 minutes of fame. This CD is saved by her 2 hits, ""...Cowboys.."" will be her signature song. Her whispering, the somewhat out-of-the-ordinary subject matter and good background music helps her deliver a unique song."
1,2 good songs,"All of the songs are Allanis Morrissette wanna-be's except for the 2 hits. Those are great contemporary pop songs. The rest are whiny, swearing, juvenile teenage fan grabbing attempts. Paula should stick to adult contemporary, and quit trying to appeal to everyone, because I hated this album as a whole. It's now sitting in the used CD rack at the local CD shop."
2,overridden by Dawson's Creek,"The initial reason I listened to ""This Fire"" is because the last track---""I Don't Want to Wait""---is the theme from ""Dawson's Creek."" The track is so associated with the TV show that ""Tiger"" felt more like a music video with Michelle Williams or Katie Holmes than anything else. After a few tracks, however, I forgot about ""Dawson's Creek"" and the CD no longer appealed to me."
1,Tori Amos Clone,"Please don't buy this album, I'm sorry but I've been wanting this album for at least 6 years and am hugely disappointed now that I have it. The 2 singles ('where have all the cowboys gone' and 'I don't want to wait') are totally uncharacteristic of the rest of the content and belong to a different artist. Even guest vocals by Peter Gabriel cannot save this effort. This is Paula Cole trying to do Tori Amos and doing it very poorly, please instead buy Under the Pink which is Tori Amos doing Tori Amos very well thank you."
1,not what I expected,I had only heard Paula Cole on a Chris Botti CD. I likedher voice so I searched for a CD of her alone. What a disappointment. Seemed like screaming to me!!!She certainly has changed!!!
2,It Doesn't Do Paula Justice,"I bought this CD hoping to indulge in the power that Paula Cole has onstage (I loved her TV concert with Peter Gabriel), but this CD just doesn't give us the full effect of the talent Paula Cole has. As for longevity, it's too early to tell, but hopefully her next release will let us in on her talent more. Not a very good CD, but not horrible."
5,Beautiful voice,My favorite songs were''I don't want to wait and''Me''.They were really beautiful and you can just feel specialness when you hear it!
2,I thought it would grow on me if I gave it a couple tries...,"I thought it would grow on me if I listened to the CD a couple times because there are a couple songs I find good, and one that I really enjoy. The problem was, the album didn't grow on me, it grated on my nerves to the point where I didn't enjoy the songs I knew I used to like. To much screaming for my taste... I liked the song ""feelin' love"" because I will always associate it with the movie City of Angels (it's on that soundtrack.) I also enjoy the song ""Where have all the cowboys gone"" and ""I don't want to have to wait"". Everything else on the CD is not worth my time to listen to. You'd be better off listening to the radio and keeping your money."
3,Two or Three Good Songs,"Skip the cowboys and go straight to 'hush, hush, hush'. 'Carmen' is also worth listening to over again. Paula has a strong and versatile voice not unlike Pat Benetar's, and her shortcomings are similar. Worth a listen or two."
3,"definitely a ""chick"" album - a good thing","Men (most of you)- stay away. Although her raspy attempts at higher notes is a bit grating, I connected with the wide range of emotions expressed on this CD. Look forward to hearing more from her, written in her vocal range."
1,Disappointing and very unoriginal,"Expected something a lot better from someone who has worked with an artist as talented as Peter Gabriel. For me, most of her songs started to become tiresome after listening to them just once or twice. Before purchasing this album, I would strongly recommend that you listen to Tori Amos, who is a far better singer and songwriter than Cole."
4,Not another Feminazi!!!,"Jesus! Did anybody read the review from that d***head who said Paula was ""just another angry feminist""? Wow. Oh no! Not another one of those horrible feminist singers!!! They're taking over the airwaves!!! Paula Cole, Sarah McLachlan, Fiona Apple, Alanis Morisette!!!!!! We'll all be killed! That guy (and it was oh so obvious he was a guy, either that or a disgrace to women.) was a complete and utter moron. Pure and simple, this cd was fantastic. GORGEOUS vocals, interesting rhythm, and that guest appearance by Peter Gaberiel blew me away. Being raised on just ""Sledgehammer"", ""Steam"", etc. as examples of his work, I was suprised he had such a deep and powerful voice.Simply put, great cd, buy it. ESPECIALLY if you're one of those crazy feminists."
2,Could be much better!!,"Nipping at Tori Amos's heels? I think not!! Tori is far more talented and has a stronger more beautiful voice. I bought this CD and was very disapointed. ""Where have all the Cowboys Gone"" is the only song I could really listen to. Her voice is too much and althoughI gave it my best shot - I sold it back. If you are looking for quality female singers, try Tori Amos, Heather Nova, Jonatha Brooke, Beth Orton, Sarah McLachlan, or Ani Difranco - Don't waste your money here!!"
1,Two good songs - the rest of the record is awful,"Gee, I really liked the two songs on this record that got airplay. So I bought the record and hated the rest of the album. I found the rest of the record to be filled with trite and pretentious lyrics, and uninspired musicianship. I haven't bought a record that I dislike this much in a long time."
2,Blah.,"I heard from many people that this was an amazing CD, so I gotit. Boy, was I disappointed! I've definitely heard better. Granted, it doesn't have a really great song on it.. (""I Don't Want to Wait"") I really liked ""Where Have All the Cowboys Gone"" the first *few* times I heard it. Basically, this is another CD I've added to my ""CD-Graveyard"" (the drawer I stuff all my ""I don't listen to these anymore"" CDs in.)"
3,i dont wanna wait,My favrit song on the album is i dont wanna wait.But know the songs have touched my life and have thought me stuff i thought no one could.My point is thaet you can relate to this album so much thaet it is actually scary.But I recommend this album highley.
1,Paula Cole: Just Another Feminist,"Paula Cole proves herself just another typical angry feminist with this album. No, I take that back--she proves herself an angry feminist willing to cater to the sugary-pop cravings of the at times tasteless radio audience. She ranges from completely furious and bitter on some of her songs, like ""Throwing Stones,"" to soppily insincere on such top ten hits as ""I Don't Wanna Wait."" Although she demonstrates considerable pomise in both her skilled instrument playing and her at-times decadent voice, Cole in the end puts forth a lackluster record which leaves the listener unsatisfied."
4,I THINK THAT A MUSIC FAN HATES PAULA COLE,"That's right because when you read only the least rating reviews, you only see opinions from ""A Music Fan"".I love you Paula!!!"
4,"A great CD, if you like the style.","I have to admit, I bought the CD because I'm a Dawson's Creek fan and the theme song, ""I Don't Want To Wait,"" is on the album. But once I listened to whole thing, it was really good. It was full of emotion. But if you don't like that kind of thing, don't buy it. It's not for everyone."
2,save your money,"Boring and annoying. Very disapointing that this got a grammy, there is so much great music out there."
3,Very good female vocalist,"Paula has a great voice but I think she's doin' too much with it.I discover this lady, like many other, at the Peter Gabriel concert in 1991 (I believe). She has a beautiful voice, there is no doubt about it but sometimes, too much is not better than not enough. Paula has a superb voice range but I think it would sound better without being always at the extreme limit of it on every word she sang."
3,GEMSOUND PA-5505 AMP USE,"tHIS AMP WAS nICE COSMETICALLY (JUST WISH A MANUAL CAME WITH IT).... My MICS both XLR AND 1/4"" PLUG connect also sounded NICELY in my peavey speakers. (just wish a manual was available).... The blue lights in the dark shine like little eyes (Manual anyone). NOw I need to connect a cassette player to this unit.... (Manual needed PA-5505)"
1,Avoid at all costs,"I'm a sucker for a vampire movie and usually watch every one that comes along and I can usually find something I like, but this was the exception.Acting is terrible, the script is even worse, whoever wrote the dialogue should be shot.The filming isn't too bad, obviously an amateur, but I could get past that if the sets weren't so ugly, dirty, forboding and boring.Compared to this turkey, ""Love at First Bite"" is academy-award worthy."
1,This is PLAIN GARBAGE!!!,The movie could have been good...they took a decent story and messed it up....not worth $5....avoid at all costs!! I'm glad I rented it first!
1,LIGHTEN UP!,"This flick is a ""B"" movie! for crying out loud, they probably had a budget of about 6k. When you are working with those figures you have to as they say in the business: WRITE FOR BUDGET"" this flick had a lot of problems eg, the script, but it wasn't (that) bad, it is fairly enjoyable IF, you meet it half way, and refrain from holding it to million dollar budget standards, yes it is worth seeing once."
2,"Yo, this film is dope, G.......For the MTV crowd only.","""Vampiyaz"" is a real dopey, stereotype loaded and poorly filmed. Its a complete waste of plastic and metal. Anyone who gave this film a good review must like watching ""Yo, MTV Raps"" all day (like a brain dead, Ritilin-addicted teenager).Pure garbage."
4,Helpful but not perfect,"I am in the process of studying Japanese to prepare for living in Tokyo next year. Learning Japanese through the Living Language series is helpful but also has some drawbacks. The biggest drawback is that the writers fail to include pronunciation helps in the text itself, however they do indeed provide native Japanese speakers to help in the accompanying three CDs. Also, they spend the first four or five lessons on various grammatical topics, which can actually be a little confusing when trying to learn a new language. Other language series jump into learning words and phrases by repetition, citing the fact that to really learn any new language you must practice repeating it over and over out loud and not worry at first about grammar and syntax. That being said, I will seek to finish the 40 lesson in this course and hope it better prepare me for my year that will be spend in Japan."
5,About ATM networks book,"It is a good book for IT people. It can be also very useful for academia, researchers, scientists, and engineers dealing with packet video communications over ATM networks."
4,Fast Delivery,"Order came in really fast... Other than an extra red outline around the yellow land portion, product was acceptable. Flag will be folded and in a framed case so that part won't show."
4,Good little Tank,"This is a 2 1/2 gallon tank. That is a suitable size for a betta, however, the bugger the getter. You can decorate this nice, with gravel, nice fake or real plants, and aybe a little house to swim through. You may have to change the water ever one to two weeks."
3,EXTREMELY SLOW SHIPPING,"The item was exactly as described and arrived just fine. However, it took an extended amount of time for the order to be processed and the shipping was slow. I ordered several items on this same day and this item took over a week longer than the others to arrive despite having the same shipping speed. I was disappointed by this."
1,Not prety at all!,"Unless ALL your concern is children safety, don't buy this bowl.I bought mine based on the good reviews and photos, but felt very disappointed when received it. It is made of plastic, yes... but the plastic is not 100% clear and looks cheap and ugly.Definitely not going to use it. Sorry for my waste of money!"
5,Our Betta Loves It,We got this bowl for a Betta fish. The fish is happy and has a good amount of space to swim around in. The bowl looks good. Since it's made of plastic I feel safer with little kids in the house - and it's also lighter so easier to handle. Overall this is a great buy.
5,Perfect fit for two gold fish,Perfect and lightweight! We won two golf fish at the local festival here and it could not be more perfect!
2,Cheap,"This fishbowl is not very good quality and the edges around the opening are very sharp and I cut myself. Very flimsy, but I guess that is what you should expect for the price. I also had a huge issue getting the item shipped properly and bought this from a different person that I originally ordered from. I would not recommend this product."
5,The Cosmic Whale is happy,"My betta fish, has all the room it wants to swim around and has pretty much been doing so nonstop for the past 4 days. Its kinda hard to get it out of the tank cause the top is so small but I am very happy with this purchase."
4,"Oppressive Parents"" How to leave them and love them","A good read for anyone trying to understand an oppressive parent or other ""toxic"" personality. The author's mom was the extreme of this type of behavior. Hopefully, most oppressive personalities are not this bad."
5,Space Saving Clear sound and Stylish,Great stereo system. Great sound for a small stereo with great features for mounting. Incredibly sleek and attractive. Truly top notch. Great longevity and surprisingly durable as well.
4,Sound Space SS5,Excellect equipment for the price; next tier up is Bang & Oluffsen. Nakamichi brand once more in a high pedestal.
5,Love this seat,My girl was ready for a big girl booster seat and we wanted something more portable for our van. She picked this design. It's adorable and easy to use. Amazon shipped SUPER fast. Very happy with it.
5,Perfect Ariel Booster Seat,I bought this for my sister's car. It stays in there all the time and my daughter absolutely loves it. She loves ariel which is the main reason that I bought it. No complaints.....
5,One Great Little Booster Seat!,"Just bought this booster seat a few weeks ago. We had the same type in the drab old blue and black color scheme that was a hand-me-down from a friend, and it was good, so we decided to get this one for my van. The gray color compliments the color of my interior in the van, and my daughter just adores the Little Mermaid print! Even though we've only had it a very short time, we've gotten so many positive comments on it from other parents and children! Also, the seat is well cushioned and comfortable, and putting it together was no-brainer -- simply snap the arms into place, add the screw for extra stability and done! A really great booster seat, for a really great price -- thanks Amazon!"
5,McQuay-Norris Extreme FA1676E Upper Ball Joint,The McQuay-Norris Extreme FA1676E Upper Ball Joints are high quality ball joints made in USA and had good fitment for my application. I'm happy with the installation and the performance to date.
1,An embarassment!,"Purchased the national flag of Greece through FlagtasticFlags.com. Not only did the product arrive 10 days late, but it wasn't even the true flag of Greece. The Greek flag is sky blue and white, while the flag I received was navy/royal blue and white. This would be similar receiving an American flag in pink white and purple.I made three separate attempts to contact FlagtasticFlags.com and they did not return my emails. They list no phone number on their website. Yet, they claim to have excellent customer service.EXTREMELY DISATISFIED!DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!"
5,Awesome!!!!,Awesome sticker for the cost and it arrived on time with out any problems. Cool stuff recommend this to anybody that loves this team.
4,What I expected,"The glue for the binding was undone, but that has happened to me with two other Hellboy collections I have purchased in store. Other than that no issues. Good read."
4,Hellboy versus big monsters. What's not to like?,"There's lots of decent content in ""Hellboy, Volume 5: Conqueror Worm"", but my favorite story in here was the one used for the volume's title. The long, meaty (pun intended) ""Conquerer Worm"" takes themes and set pieces from a variety of other Hellboy adventures and does them over bigger, better, and more intensely, almost as if Mike Mignola was making his own little Hellboy movie. So, even though you might say to yourself, ""Hmmmm, hasn't Hellboy fought a big worm before?"", you won't care because this is a bigger and better worm and there's lots more drama and danger. Anyway, the whole book is good, but you'll especially want to curl up with the ""Conquerer Worm"" epic. Keep these Hellboy collections coming."
2,Poor Quality,Item took a long time to receive and when received it was poorly packaged which caused damage to book.Cover fell off after one handling! Tried to contact vendor and have had no response. Will NOT buy from this vendor again. Be warned! If you buy from this vendor be prepared to receive your item late and in damaged condition. Don't expect any help from the vendor as they will not contact you. Customer service is terrible!
5,Me Likey!,"This is really good. Easily one of the best of the five library editions (and I own all five). I just finished reading it and will gladly reread it to pick up all the subtleties of DF's art that I'm sure I missed (in my initial excitement). Be warned, there is definitely an element of horror to Hellboy stories. I would therefore not say this volume is appropriate for all ages. Anyway, I'm obviously a Hellboy fan and this edition fully satisfies."
3,A Bit Disappointed...,"The first time I watched the trailer it was raining outside... and after watching it my heart poured as well. I was so moved by the trailer that I told myself, as a videographer and as a soundtrack buff, I simply had to go watch the movie and get the soundtrack. It was ttwo disappointing trips. But first on the score. Nothing on the trailer was on the CD which was baffling. I do believe that a true soundtrack should have what's on the movie (and trailer if it has original score written for it), and thee extended versions the composer simply wishes to include aka the composer's complete story.Touching sounds and echoes but needed the complete score for me to give this a 5 star....."
5,Even if you never see the movie,"There are a few soundtracks that are so fantastic that they can stand alone even if you never see the movie. Examples for me are Field of Dreams and Henry V. This is another example of a stand alone soundtrack. I subscribe to Real Rhapsody and heard it on there. Even though the point in subscribing to R. Rhapsody was to cut down on my CD purchases, I knew I had to get this CD. The music is absolutely fantastic. Its a moving and passionate tribute to those who were on the front lines almost 5 years ago."
5,Awesome Album!,"I have had this cd for about a year now, and it is awesome! I really didn't know how i would like it, but let me tell you it will blow you away! It is very powerful and exciting with a surprise with each new track! Each track varies greatly in either musical tempo, or the loudness or the softness of the song. Each song will put you on the end of your seat, making you anxious and excited about the next song! The most popular song on this cd is probably ""The Old Apartment"", but I enjoy every song! My favorite is ""Brian Wilson"". This cd also includes a live concert experience that will provide you with musical enjoyment for several decades! It is obvious to notice how talented this group is. The variety of the songs shows the band's range and capabilities. Just buy it and see for yourself!"
5,the best album ever,this is the best baranaked ladies i've ever listened to. This album proves that BNL is one of the best pop group on the face of the earth
5,A Great CD,"This CD was recorded live at their concert in Chicago during 1996. Steven Page one of the band members wrote most of the songs. The main instruments are the drums and the guitar. I enjoyed this CD very much. It has a great adagio tempo. None of the songs are boring. The songs arent usual songs, they are about all types of stuff. They arent the usual love songs and that is what I really like about it. They are also really fun to sing along to. My favorite song on this CD is either Break Your Heart or The Old Apartment."
5,Timeless...,"Sounds just as fresh today as when I bought it years ago. They may not sell albums like they used to, but this album shows why they rule as a live act."
4,Worth it for the enhanced material,"""Rock Spectacle"" is a fun album and a decent introduction to the group for the casual listener. But as far as the music is concerned, fans will be better served by buying the studio recordings. The songs aren't that much different from the studio versions and all of them are available on the first three albums (which are all fabulous!). Even though this is a concert album, it doesn't have much of the live wackiness the Ladies are known for. What this album really has going for it, is the extra material. I keep this CD with my CD-ROMs rather than my music. Drop it into your computer and watch the band at their silly best."
5,THE GREATEST!!!!!!!!!!,"After listening to all BNL CD's, this one is the best. I never skip a song and even my mom likes it. I can't say enough about it. Go get this CD. You will love it, even if you are not a BNL fan."
3,can't download as mp3 for my i-pod!!!,"I would have given this great cd 5 stars, since I really love it, but I bought it because I wanted to download it as an mp3 to listen to on i-tunes (my computer with itunes has made my old cd player obsolete) & i-pod. How frustrating to find out that Warner Brothers has done something to the cd to prevent me from being able to download it -- a completely legal act! Argh!I have since heard that this practice is becoming more widespread. Guess I'll stop buying cd's and just order songs online. Too bad for Amazon."
1,WHO CARES ABOUT THIS LIVE CD ALBUM FROM BARENAKED LADIES!,"I recommend the other Barenaked Ladies albums like ""Gordon"", ""Maybe You Should Drive"", ""Born On A Pirate Ship"" and ""Stunt"". They're what i call it the definitive BNL rock music to listen to from a studio instead of a live track performance album unplugged they have in concert from canada's very own comedy trio, musical artist for what they've done to achieve in the guys successful career this one does'nt suit my taste here!"
5,"If you like BNL, you'll love this C.D.","This is a fine album. The Ladies go all out on this one. If you haven't purchased a BNL c.d., let this be the first. It is the Ladies live. The Barenaked Ladies are the BEST Ever, ""Ohh, for Christ sake"", get this Disc. I got this Disc because I was interested in their Music and now They are the only Group I Will listen to at Home."
4,Interesting book,"This is a well-written book describing the list of covert operations mostly undertaken by the CIA (a few by the Pentagon ) during the Cold War.It details the successfull ones such as those that took place in Iraq ,Guatemala,the Congo,Afghanistan and the failures such as Albania,the Baltics,Cuba and ukraine.It disucsses the limitations of such operations as well as the utility.In my own view ,the CIA is maligned as an incompetent intelligence agency,this book shows that the CIA did pull off some successfull coups that whilst it does raise some moral and ethical questions ,did play a roll in containing the growth of Communism and ultimately contributed to America's victory during the Cold War ,thus preserving the bastions of democracy and consigning this warped ideology to the dustbin of history."
3,"Good, but not that good","Some research was definetly put into writing this book. And at times, the author just throughs out some abstract, needless information. Almost as if he just to put it in their, because he thought the trival knowledge would make the book better.Well it doesn't. It does fine all by itself. It gives some great insightful information to the reason behind some of U.S invasions, wars, and other candelstine efforts foreign and domestic.Anybody that lived through the era that the book was covered will get bored easily as no true secrets are revealed. But for those born around the 80's, will become very informed.A good book, but not that good. I give it three stars because the title does not match the book."
5,Anita Is Terrific!!,"Remember this girls name..It won't be long before she is racking up awards and gold albums, with this no doubt being her first. Not only does she have a voice to die for, Anita plays the guitar and has written several of the songs on this CD. She has a wide vocal range reminisant of such greats as Tammy Wynette, Barbara Mandrell and Wynonna. There is not one bad song on this CD..A few plays and you will be singing along and waiting anxiously for the next CD from Anita."
5,A Rare Country Artist With Full Range of Skills,"A great singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and performer who still really loves country. If the industry is looking for the future of the sound, it should quit all the pop prom queen nonsense and line up behind her blazing Telecaster!"
5,Great cd,Great cd from one of the best living female country-western singers. I am also glad that 2 songs from the Dukes of Hazzard go to Hollywood are on this cd.
2,Christian Book Review of Hopper's Easter Surprise,"Easter in its original definition had to do with spring. In that case, the title and content of this book is correct.The word Easter by today's definition is the name given to the Christian holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. It is the most important moment in time for all Christians, as Christ through his free gift gave us the promise of a life without sin, death, pain, suffering and sorrow.A story about rabbits and eggs is not about Easter. It is a story about easter -- lower case."
1,Second-hand part,"I bought this to replace a faulty Exhaust Gas Recirculation Valve on my '96 Geo Metro, but when it arrived it didn't test to the specifications required in the OEM repair manual. I sent it back and received a replacement but it also failed the volt-meter tests. Did not function as it is supposed to. It would seem these parts are factory seconds being sold as new/functional parts.In the end I had to request a refund because neither of the parts I was sent worked or resolved the computer error code. A big waste of time."
5,"Excellent product, outrageous price.","This is a good practice bag. The quality is fine, it seems to be evenly packed, and the fit'n'finish is acceptable.Unfortunately, Amazon's price is a bit steep. They claim to offer ""free"" shipping, but the shipping costs are obviously hidden in the price. You can get this same bag, along with padded bag gloves, hand wraps, and Everlast's mounting kit, for less $$$ at Walm@rt. Plus, you won't have to wait a week or more for FedEx to deliver it.In recent years, Everlast products have earned a reputation for shoddy quality. If you check my other reviews, you'll see where I gave another Everlast product a bad review. However, this bag is top quality. The only thing that could make it better is if it was made from leather, but that's not a problem, unless you want to kick it while wearing shoes.Summary: good quality, bad price."
4,Decent clock for the money.,"I bought this clock to save space on my nightstand.Pros:Good priceLots of features for the moneyGreat for saving spaceWorks well for a travel clockAesthetically pleasingOnly uses 1 AAA batteryDual alarmsSnoozeCons:The Atomic clock is qwirky.The numbers will appear blurry unless you view at a specific angle.Setting up the alarms was confusing (and still is).The only reason why I did'nt give this clock 5 stars is because I had difficulty setting the alarms and the instructions were somewhat vague. Also, the atomic clock didnt calibrate itself until 2 days later. Overall, this clock is well worth the money."
3,atomic travel clock,"Most functions work fine, but the night light is not bright enough to read anything at night"
1,Design Flaw,"The clock kept time well but--the miniature bulb or LED that was supposed to illuminate the display to be able to tell time at night was poorly-positioned, almost hidden behind the mounting. I returned the clock for exchange but got a refund instead. I guess this means that the entire production run was defective."
3,Get the one with the Indeglo backlight.,Get the one with the Indeglo backlight. I bought both of these one with the Indeglo backlight & one with the small almost useless backlight. The one with the Indeglo is my favorite it is 5 stars.
5,Great for Compare/Contrast Essay,"I'm using this book along with Lois Lowry's ""The Giver"" in my 8th Grade ELA class. Since the books are similar, it's easy to write a compare/contrast essay. Most of my students hate both books...but it takes them until the end of each book before they say the exact opposite."
5,Truesight (Trilogy) highly recommended!,"Truesight is the first of an awesome trilogy! (See ""The Seer"" and ""Otherspace"" for the rest of the trilogy.) The author helps you see things in a new way with this world of people who have no vision. I know I'll always like the books better, but I still want to see this as a Hollywood movie! It's as creative as Avatar, and way more creative than most of the movies they are putting out these days."
4,Underdeveloped but Decent,"Amid a futuristic society where genetic engineering allows parents to order custom babies, a group of zealots decides to start a colony where everyone is blind. The story picks up with a few young teenagers coping with growing up within this society and questioning the life that has been chosen for them.The first 3/4 of the book did good job of developing the main character and setting up for a conflict, but the end felt rushed. I think the concept is a bit more intriguing than the actual book. Worth reading though."
3,"Some compelling ideas, but underwhelming","I like the premise of this book, but the ideas at its core were poorly developed, and logical details (like the lead's quite adjustment to the sighted world... even reading subtle facial expressions he'd never known about before!) distract. Plus, it's basically the exact same book as the vastly superior ""The Giver."" Still, worth the 90 minutes it takes to read."
3,1 Part Anthem + 2 Parts Giver,"This book is highly reminisant of the two aforementioned books, but seems to lack a certain quality that truely made the other books great. A strong start, leading to a brilliantly written rising action that drives strongly that starts to loose steam, and leading to a climax that seems betraying to me to all of the set up.I enjoyed it, and found it entertaining, but I wanted something more from it. There were so many oppurtunities to explore issues that were skipped on, especially in the discovery of all of the hypocracies of the town.I think that for the discussion of all issues shared with Anthem and the Giver I would recomend those.There could be some good discussion about the portrayal of those with sight imparment and thier ability to live independantly, but that would be about the only thing I would recomend it for."
4,bright and cheerful,"I really do love this book - I think the message is great and not at all religious, which I also like. The illustrations are fun and bright and happy, and the poem it illustrates is sweet. I personally really love this book - it makes me happy just to read it.My 5-year-old, however, isn't as keen on it as I am. He sits through it, but he doesn't ever request it - I am always the initiator of the reading of this book. I don't know if he finds it preachy, since that word isn't in in his vocabulary yet - it might be more something like he feels there is an agenda to it. He seems to sense when I am wanting him to read something rather than when he is just choosing it. So maybe it is my wanting him to like it that sort of puts him off of it, I'm not sure.Is this review even helpful? I don't know, this is just our experience I suppose. So MY review is glowing, while his is just ""eh""."
3,Good,"This book is good. More for 5 year olds and up, I would think. I do have to explain a lot to my 4 and 2 1/2 year old what the words mean. But still, this is a nice book. Loving and fun! Pictures are bright and cheery!"
4,"An Appealing, Well-Written Book for Toddlers","This rhyming, rhythmic board book describes a pleasant litany of things to be thankful for, reveling in the joys of everyday life. The speaker expresses a warm trust toward a loving God, although some families may be disappointed to find no mention of Jesus or the Cross. Still, this is an appealing, well-written book, appealing to a wide variety of Christian denominations, that will help cultivate gratitude in its preschool audience."
3,Inside Boeing,"I found Sabbagh's story about the marketing and building of the 777 interesting. I, like some of the other reviewers would have enjoyed more detail on tne physical aspects of the plane, and less about the people involved. I did enjoy it enough to recomend it."
1,A Soporific Nightmare,"I am a great fan of commercial aviation, and read many books on the subject. But this book is a soporific nightmare. The style of the author is trite, hackneyed, and the tone is overly melodramatic."
5,"very safe, stable, high quality toy, nice looking",Our son has a lot of fun with this toy.He learns how to operate the steering wheel to change directionIt seems to be very stable and safe to play with.It looks nice and seems to be extremely durable and versatile.I think he will enjoy playing with it for some years.
4,F U N,"In Germany you find them everywhere since the 70's, and that is for a reason.A lot of fun, indoor/outdoor use (even on grass), usable from young age, everlasting.Just pass this toy on to the next generation :) There are even people that convert them into little motor powered race cars, we prefer the noise free, sustainable version though :)"
2,Silly Songs are too Silly!!!,"I was very disappointed with this video. We own 5 other Baby Songs videos and my daughter loves them. She will dance and clap her hands when the videos are on. My mother got her the Silly Songs video because I always tell her how much my daughter loves the other Baby Songs videos. We were shocked to see children in this video putting their feet all over their bodies, a little boy washing his hands in a fish tank, children putting shoes on their hands, a little girl who has a very messy room, AND a bunch of children stuffing everything, including a moldy cake, into a closet. Maybe this video would be ok for older children who know better, but to our 18 month old, we are trying to teach her that shoes go on her feet and to keep her hands OUT of our fish tank."
5,One of the best modern rock cd's - christian or otherwise,"This is an excellent cd: musically, thematically, lyrically... It rocks in all dimensions! As others note it is far from the mechanical stuff the industry churns out."
1,Not what I expected,This book wasn't at all what I expected. My daughter and I agreed it really wouldn't help address the emotions my grandkids are experiencing as their parents divorce. Seemed like it would be more helpful for adults; a child wouldn't get it.
1,"Very dangerous, cheap materials","Initially, I congratulated myself on this purchase. It looked lovely in my nursery, and seemed to be a good buy. However, today after I removed the very thin changing pad I tapped the paper thin piece of cardboard that is all the support that your baby gets, and it broke through! Thank goodness my baby was not on the table! You really do get what you pay for sometimes. By all means, make sure that the changing table you buy has a solid support on the upper level!"
4,"Good for the price, but incorrect description about height","I chose this changing table for its price and versatility. I was happy when it arrived, because it looks pretty, and the quality of wood is ok for the price. The nutural color matches my crib very well. I like the side rails, since I can use it as a toy shelf to keep baby's toys when baby is older. The only disappointment is it is only 33 inches in height, while the description says it is 35 inches. If you don't mind the height, I would recommend this product."
4,good travel toy,"The advantage of this toy is that you can squish it when packing and its fine, you can also attach it to the plastic links that in turn attach to the stroller. My child was more amused by my husband throwing the oball up and catching it on his index finger. Other than that he was not as interested in it as I hopped but if nothing else is around he will use it as a teether or just hold on to it."
2,Oball is so so,"My grandson didn't acquire much of an interest in this ball at all. He isn't the type of child that plays with toys for any length of time, though, so I'll try it again on my next baby and hope for more success. This child did like the more expensive Vulli sophie the giraffe,while he was an infant (5mos- 9mos), which I purchased at the same time. I think that the ability to chew was more important at the infant stage, and the ball is for grasping instead of chewing. The giraffe does both!"
3,bud,This watch comes as shown (and arrived very quickly from Amazon). It works well and is easy to set. The only problem is the velcro band. It is not long enough to slip over my hand - I have to thread it though the slot to fasten (not easy to do one-handed). This is advertised as an adult man's watch but the band is more for a smaller person (by the way I don't have large hands - I only wish that I could palm a basketball).
3,"Nicely sized interface, but hope your wrist is small","Pros: The user interface is strong, it's straightforward, the watch is easy to program. It has a large LED display and all features work as advertised. If I was willing to buy a larger band for this, I'd actually use it. If you're buying it for a younger teenager, they'll likely be happy.Cons: I have a relatively average 8 1/2"" wrist. If your hand and wrist are considerably smaller, this will fit you. I have to completely separate the band from the loop, which barring a better word, 'sucks' when putting the watch on. It's a flat out pain to put on my wrist. I don't bother to try to wear this watch and will give it away when I find the right person that can wear it.But if I was 13 or so, running cross country, I'd love it."
5,an 11 dollars well spent,"I've only had it for a week, but it just feels durable. The velcro strap makes the perfect fit easy, and has a clear display of everything you need. Nothing that someone who just needs a practical watch like myself can complain about. Some people want their watch to be fancy and eye-catching, but for a practical man with a need for a practical watch that is neither eye-catching nor unattractive (I actually like the look very much), it's an awesome buy."
5,McClain,"This is the best watch for my job. It has been to Iraq, Germany, and the USA. It is still the best purchase for me this year."
4,Great bargain on a great watch,"I really liked the design and description of this watch from the ad and the real thing lives up to it. It is a very good timepiece that does everything I need - clear numbers, convenient date and day of the week display, and the light provides good illumination that stays lit a few seconds past the button being pushed. The alarm and timer functions are also very helpful. All in all, a very good deal."
4,AS ALWAYS......,"a good album by a good choir! I had the distinct pleasure of seeing this choir perform live in San Diego--all 250 members!!! It was good to see Vonnie Ewing-Lopez's ""Still I Will Trust You"" make it on a Brooklyn recording. She is deserving and a wonderful songwriter! ""Calvary Came Through... is a classic and one of their best! A GREAT tape overall!!!!!!"
5,SUPER!!,"This is a great CD! I absolutely love the title song ""Favorite Song of All""! If you love gospel music, I think you love this CD.www.pictureperfectphotorestoration.net"
2,Lack of color makes a dull book.,"The cards are all reproduced in black and white, and many are less than original size. Because of this the beauty, impact and some information provided by color are lost. It could have been so much better with at least some color. As it is, a disapointment."
4,Great Gift,"Great for a collegue/boss; The box was elegant and looked more expensive than it actually was. Especially for cigar afficionados, this travel case is a nice addition to their collection of smoke gadgets."
4,"Smells Divine, Creates Soft Skin","I bought this with the rest of the Truth line (based on a sample I used and loved) and I really like it. First, it smells divine-a citrus vanilla scent that's fresh but not cloying. Second, it makes my skin, usually dry, very clear and soft. I do not find it irritating. I'm using it in summer and it's not making me oily and I do sometimes use a moisturizer with it (not Ole H)because it does not provide a lot of mositure. If I had oilier skin it might be enough on its own. I use it at night and I do not wake up with anything unexpected (breakouts, oil, puffiness)and it has made my skin clear and soft. I'm really loving this line."
5,Amazing product!,I have combination oily acne prone skin and have tried a lot of products. This product works great. I don't end up oily and my skin looks years younger. I am on my second order!
3,Kind of disappointed!,"I watched Ole H. on QVC but his products, in my opinion, are over priced for the results you get! I'm kind of disappointed to have spent over $200 for his products that didn't have the best results! I get better results using Oil of Olay for a much more affordable price!"
3,nice not sure if I see a difference,Love the smell and the texture. It feels wonderful on my skin. I dont know if I see much of a difference though
4,it's a good product,"I am pleased with this product. I have a mixt type of skin and after a couple of days of using this serum my skin looks better, my skin is brighter."
2,Veterinary MM,"The reprint was date 1997 and has the older cover, not the one pictured on Amazon. Also, there is no index in the back nor reference list fororganizations. There are very brief and incomplete descriptions of theremedies; however, some value to the book as it has some little known remedies that warrant further research."
4,Nice bubbles,"Classic Italian fragrance, wonderfully frothy bubbles. I wouldn't mind a little stronger scent, it is subtle but wonderful. I love the classic Euro-retro stylin...Recommended"
2,Overrated and Outdated,"The book is very overrated. Most of the ideas are outdated. The book is purely autobiographical. Haynes talks in great depth about how he became rich every step of the way from the sixties through the nineties. Those bargains that existed long time ago, just don't exist anymore. He talks about buying land in the wilderness, swamp land and on mountain tops. This isn't going to have useful purposes for most people who want land that they can live on. The book may have been useful and interesting reading at one time. In today's day, the book is irrelevent. It would be a waste of money to buy,"
5,"Practical, sound advice on the importance investing","This video provides a concise overview of the ""why's and how-to's"" of investing, especially for women, but also emphasizes the IMPORTANCE of investing for all women. Women of all ages, walks of life, marital status, etc. need to know these things so that they can be an active financial partner with a spouse or make good financial decisions for themselves. Economic security and the independence it brings is possible for everybody."
4,Whats the matter,"Elkies version of the late great Timi Yuro's ""Whats The Matter Baby, is superb, some other great tracks."
3,Taste better than regular pasta. Disappointed that it is not 100% Jerusalem artichoke flour,"I bought this after seeing it on Dr. Oz show. Dr. Oz said this product is made of Jerusalem artichoke flour that is not digestible, hence passes through our system resulting in weight loss. Our family loves this because it tastes better than regular pasta. But when I checked the ingredient list, the first ingredient is durum wheat semolina and the second ingredient is Jerusalem artichoke flour. That means there is more wheat than Jerusalem artichoke flour. Therefore, I don't believe it can help weight loss as much as it sounds. And definitely it is not gluten free."
3,Gulped this book down today,"I gulped down this book in one delicious bite today. Like The Fox Prince, One Heart, One Way is filled with lovely details that carried me away from the 98 degree heat and 100% humidity that is summer along the Gulf Coast of Texas and took me to a pure world of mountains and daffodils in eighth century England."
2,Not Norma's Best,"I've read a lot of Norma Klein books and this is one of my least favorite. Unlike her usual cahracters, I didn't find anyone in this book very interesting. As a romance, this certainly wasn't the best. If you want to read a Norma Klein book that you haven't read yet, I would chose ""Just Friends"" or ""No More Saturday Nights"""
2,Sligntly less than expectation,"I got this video expecting an introduction to pointe work for a beginner's level, many of the excercises seemed just too dangerous without going over enough details on how to do them properly. Even sewing of the ribbons was glossed over and lacked close ups.Overall, I felt that it lacked detail that a beginner would seriously need to start pointe properly. The basic techniques of rolling on to pointe were not iterated and some of the barre and center pointe work seemed rather dangerous for a beginner. I would have liked to have seen more disecting of going en pointe itself and more closeups."
2,Does not live up to the hype,"Summer Palace seems to be widely heralded as one of the top few Chinese films in recent decades. The synopsis portrays this story as the development of a young woman who encounters new romance and tragedy throughout her youth, across the iconic settings of ""Beiqing University"" (a thinly veiled reference to Peking U), the vaguely alluded Tiananmen incident of 1989, and the white-collar working world of modern urban Chinese.Instead, this film is a highly repetitive unraveling of the heroine's life as she tumbles haplessly from one vanilla sex scene to another. I won't spoil the ending for readers, but I have to say that I was deeply disappointed by the weakness of character development throughout the approximately 10 years that the audience is asked to endure alongside only-moderately sympathetic characters.Summer Palace might be a staple for Chinese film culture, but it is as bland as its gastronomic counterpart: white rice."
1,A slow and dreary drama.,"""Summer Palace"" is a slow and dreary drama. The main character, a young woman played by Lei Hao, is depressed for no apparent reason, and watching her drift through her life is as exciting as watching grass grow. Hao does nothing but randomly date and break up with men, all the while droning on about it in a tedious narrative. The director also made the even worse ""Purple Butterfly"". The movie would have been rated R for graphic sex scenes and nudity (which are also dreary)."
3,Fails to replicate Suzhou River,"Summer Palace tries but falls short of replicating the magical balance, symmetry and focus of Lou Ye's previous 'Suzhou River.' The lovemaking scenes are certainly effective but way too long, the story rambles and the impact of the politics of the times is not clear and sometimes seems contrived. Still a nice movie, but if you have seen 'Suzhou River' this one doesn't quite reach that level."
1,Too much sex.,"I got through about half an hour of this movie. It has way too much graphic sex. The movie is in my trash now. I don't like the sexual direction that Chinese cinema is heading towards with movies like this. It seems that an era of Chinese cinema is ending while a new one is beginning, and I don't like what has started with movies like this, Lust Caution, and 2046. No more Lou Ye movies for me."
4,"A ""real guy's or gal's"" barbeque book!","Hooray for Al! He has brought barbeque back to where it belongs - in our backyards and on our plain ol' charcoal grills! Great recipes - easy to follow - you don't need to search the far corners of the earth for the ingredients - and, best of all - they taste great! Put this book on the top of your cookbook wishlist - it's worth it!"
2,"Sorry Al, I found it a little bland",I was hoping that Al would focus on barbecue recipes from contest like Memphis in May or some of the other programs that he has done on the Food Network. If you are looking for sauce baced barbecue look elsewhere.
5,Hot!,This color looks gross in the tube but it was EXACTLY what I wanted when I put it on. It's DARK berry pink. It stains really well. It's a serious color.
2,Cheap but Too Dry,"I was really excited to get my first coral-colored lipstick. But when I tried it on, it was very dry and cakey. It made little clumps. It looked nice after I used clear gloss over the lipstick."
1,Cheap and cheap.,I've bought four or these over the last month or so. They seem to last anywhere from a day to a month before they break. They are cheap at only $5 or so but you'd like to think they'd last longer than they do. I won't buy these anymore.
2,Not what I expected,"This video was not what I expected. I was expected kick boxing and there was not kicking at all - primarily punches and some cardio. The moves were pretty basic and easy to follow - until she got to the combinations. There was no instruction before she started with the combination and they were done so fast that, at least for me, they were impossible to follow. I just basically did my own thing during these sections. I also did not feel like I got a very good workout with this tape. I have done other kickboxing and cardio tapes that I like much better - they gave me a better workout and were much easier to follow. Try Janice Saffell, Tae Bo, or Gilad."
3,Ray of Hope and Sunshine,"It is interesting to see the growth of the main character progress across this play of power. Politics is never pretty, and the author makes use of a splendid juxtaposition of this fact with the reminding scar on Kate's throat -feeling swollen like a lump of sorrow. We can see Kate's role as a bodyguard to Anne reflecting her inner desire to guard herself. It is no accident of fate that both these characters happen to be female, as well as the murder victim darling. Dana's subtlety in writing comes out again and makes a stunning show. Angel Beecham is marvelously complex, and hits us like a drug. A drug that fills us full of overwhelming love --What drug would that most be like I wonder? I forget the answer, maybe someone could help me, at any rate, it's an excellent read. I only wish there were some hot males."
3,Stabenow's 10th Shugak Novel,"The novel was, as always, well researched with a good bit of histoical fact and fiction about early Alaska mixed in this time. The author's use of the device of skipping back and forth in time throughout the book was a little annoying to me and difficult to understand the purpose of doing that until the very end of the novel. Her characters,especially the heroine, remain fresh and believable and her insight into local Alaskan politics and maybe politics in general are crisp and straightforward. The murders she is investigating this time seem very unrelated until an historical event surfaces that ties them and all the characters, new to this novel and established characters as well, together. The usual fears for the heroine's safety are present in this installment as well as the development of a possible new love interest. I'm more fond of some of the other novels in this series but the book is well written as usual."
4,Remember what Glinda said,"""It's always best to start at the beginning."" That is what Glinda, the ""Good Witch"" of the North, tells Dorothy as she sets off on her journey from Munchkinland to the Emerald City of Oz. This is also good advice for those embarking upon Dana Stabenow's Kate Shugak Alaskan mystery series. I came in mid-stream at the previous book, ""Midnight Come Again,"" and admit to being lost at times. Nonetheless, this book craftily illuminates Alaskan geography, history, sociology, and politics, and at the same time gives the reader a darned good ""who-dunnit."""
4,Another great installment in this series,This is a great series set in Alaska. I've been enjoying reading through the series and am almost done. Stabenow is a great writer.
5,Another top read,Another top read from Dana Stabenow. Not only are her books a good who-done-it but a wonderful description of Alaska and its native communities and life-style. I am always looking forward to reading the next book.
2,Another lamentable Alpha transfer,"Once again Alpha releases an all but unwatchable pan and scan transfer with poor color and a blurred image. I give it two stars because the movie itself is entertaining. When you have transfers like the Anchor Bay/Starz DVD of ERIK THE CONQUEROR, it makes you wonder why they even bother to release such an inferior product as this DVD of LAST OF THE VIKINGS. Buy it only if you want to complete your Cameron Mitchell Viking trilogy (along with ERIK THE CONQUEROR and KNIVES OF THE AVENGER...both available in gorgeous widescreen versions)."
3,Like watching on a 1963 TV with a bad rabbit-ear antenna,"Closely follows the story of the late 1950's Kirk Douglas movie ""The Vikings"". Looks like it was recorded with a 1st generation camcorder from my grandma's 12"" basement TV. Fun to collect for us ""must have all things viking"" fans, but this story was done profoundly better by the Kirk Douglas film's superior sets and Norwegian cinematography. };>{>The Vikings"
2,Last of the Vikings DVD,"I have to agree with the other reviews on poor quality of this Alpha Video reproduction. Very fuzzy picture, hardly any clarity. Voice dubbing distracting. Would have preferred having option of watching in Italian with English subtitles. No options for viewing it that way. Transfer was made in zoom mode, i.e. Images are cut off on edge of screen so heads are sometimes out of picture edge on tight close up shots. Was hard to watch and I really wanted to see this film. Does anyone know if version of this film in Warriors 50 Movie pack is any better? The 50 movie pack was put out by Mill Creek Entertainment."
3,My Life is In Your Hands,"Book was an old one, but I knew that from the description, and it was in decent and readable condition for its age. Purchase Price and Speed of delivery OK. I would purchase again from this supplier.MDP"
1,Dont Buy This I Made The Mistake it Sucks,This movie is so stupied about a cannibls i thought it was going to be good at the first and iam like a very very big horror fan thats all i watch iam warrrrrrning u DO NOT GET THIS DONT IT SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS......
5,"The worlds chessiest horror movie,but it is great","I have to admit it is chessy. It has hoorible graphics, but it is the best horror movie I've ever seen. I think it is more of a comedy.Me and my friend watch it about 10 times a month, it never gets old to us.Do yourself a favor and see this movie."
5,You have to have a sense of humor,This movie is so funny and you have to have a sense of humor to watch this. It's not meant to be scarry but gross funny. I saw this movie when I was 12 and to this day I am waiting for it to make it to DVD. It is low budget but worth the chuckles.
3,The Most Disturbing Movie. Period.,"I rented this movie a couple months ago, and I didn't know what to expect. It started out really cheesy, but then it got really disturbing. People in the movie would get killed, and then the characters in the movie would laugh. I have seen a lot of gore, and this movie had plenty, but that's not what was disturbing. I truly think the creator of this movie has pyschological issues. Overall, it's a good movie to see once, just so you can see where I'm coming from."
2,end of the Movie,"I am surprised there wasn't a Sequel to this nail """" biting """" low budget socalled horor flick.The guy in the Convertible Karmingiawas the only survivor of the film.He should-of hit the Producers for a once-again lower budget, HE WAS AWESOMEfor the part.."
3,An Interesting Approach to Chess History,"What I found intriguing about the book was that it presented the history of chess as a theory, in that the first source for (the invention of) the game of chess is ambiguously ascribed to ""traditional and conjectural theories."" So the book may be a greater source for debate than it is for precise historical information.However, this book is a mix of history and chess player analysis that is somewhat entertaining in many aspects.(c)"
2,disappointing,Very disappointing; there is no camera card; you MUST connect the camera to the computer just to SEE the images. Icons TOO small.
3,Disappointed With Cuisinart,"With great respect for the Cuisinart brand, I ordered this product only to find obvious scratches on the front of the toaster & also the appearance of much use on the sides of the toast slots. It seemed to work just fine but it just didn't come up to the standard I was expecting, thus I returned it. Amazon processed the return & my refund quickly & efficiently, so I will certainly continue to shop with Amazon but will think twice about a 'remanufactured' item in the future..."
5,Toaster,Does a great job. There is no indication in workmanship or functionality that it is a remanufactured item. Very satisfied.
2,toaster,"Look's good, just does not toast evenly.Cuisinart CPT-140BK Compact Cool-Touch 4-Slice Toaster, Black"
3,Somewhat uneven cooking,"Not a big deal, but toast comes out a little uneven. Overall i like the toaster, but have a hard time giving it more than 3 stars due to the uneven cooking."
2,Cuisinart CPT-140BK Electronic Cool Touch 4 Slice Toaster,"The looks of this toaster is great, but I may have to send it back. Its only been used a couple times and is toasting uneven. I had one slice come out light on one side and dark on the other. Im going to have to check the book again and see if its a setting or something, say for like bagels or english muffins. Yesterday I used it and the right side didnt want to stay down , then it did and didnt toast at all. I was trying to make BLT sandwich's and was in a bit of a hurry cooking some soup also for my family and just pulled the bread out and toasted it on the side that was toasting. FRUSTRATING TO SAY THE LEAST!"
1,Undercabinet LCD TV,"Sorry, I cannot recommend this product. The first one failed in about 12 - 13 months. The failure began with the DVD/CD. The system would not recognize that a DVD or CD had been inserted. Then DVD/CD drive began to screech and smell like hot electronics. I called the company and for $75 they sent me a new one and I returned the old one. The replacement - a newer model but same features - lasted about 3 months. The DVD/CD mechanism failed again. It began with the video screen blinking about every 30 seconds - it would go black for about 1 second then re-appear. Then the blinking frequency increased to about once every few seconds and finally the image just disappeared. The audio was fine, but no picture. So I bought another brand at the local department store and paid a little extra for an extended warranty - because now I am a bit concerned about these devices in general."
4,A classic is like old wine....,"The older the wine, the better. same with ""old"" american films: the scenography or make-up might appear funny nowadays, but the approach of the film directors was maybe - more human. I liked the film, I liked the conclusion, and consider this TOS episode not the best one, but one of the well-made beginnings od s-f as we know it now. Actually - the one who has perhaps the most connotations with the golden era - 50ties sf... Enjoy!"
1,i never got it,i was disappointed that i never got the movie.the money was there but they never took the money for the item
2,Children's favorites is ok,"I bought this CD specifically for ""I'm gettin nuttin for Christmas"" and the song is a shortened, disappointing version of the original. It only has one verse. My daughter's response when listening to the song: ""He's not singing it right."" The rest of the CD is ok."
5,3 Year Old Loved,"3 year old loved and so did I, a 65 year old ... lol 3 year old learned the words and sang along. A Must Buy for Children at Christmas. Take Care"
2,disappointed!,I was hoping this would be a traditional children's Christmas song CD. It wasn't and was very disappointing. I'll probably donate it to Goodwill!
5,My favorite little donkey and my kids too.,Ernest has become a household favorite of my family.It is such an adorable book and I love all the others tooRecommend this book and the others to all ages.
5,Methio-Form & Feline,"My cat has FUS Feline Urinary Syndrome. These tablets keep him healthy. He loves the flavor, they are easy to mash up into his food. No more emergency vet trips for a blocked urinary tract. The vet tried to put my cat on some other designer meds that cost 10 times more than this tried and true remedy!!! He's been on Methio-Form for 13 of his 14 years."
1,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!,"I receieved the car only to discover that it did not work. It wouldnt start at all! So sadly we were never able to use it. Thats ok, these things do happen...BUT...I could not make contact with the company. I emailed them and they never emailed back. I called them, left a phone messege and they never called back. I gave them plenty of time to respond but in the end Amazon had to refund my money because they never took any action. So...buyer beware!!! Its not worth the stress for some piece of junk toy."
5,excellent!,"I recieved my book on time and in perfect conditions just like it was said and also at a great price!! I bought Favorite Jane Austen Novels, which are 3 books and all for about $11.00!!"
5,it was a really awesome book,"This was one of the best books I've ever read, I'd recommend this book and all the other books by Jane Austen as must read books ."
5,Jane Austen junkie,I love everything Jane Austen and this is a great package to have if you are a beginner or even as a non-beginner if you just want some of her most famous books at hand.
5,A must read for anyone!!,"This is the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I had to read it for a class in 10th grade, and I have gone back to it at least once a year ever since (I'm now a sophomore in college). The characters are wonderfully constructed by Jane Austin, and I haven't read anything that compares to it yet. If you enjoy the book, I highly recommend the A&E/BBC production of it. It captures the book perfectly, and if you fell in love with Mr. Darcy the way I did, then you will fall in love with the brilliant actor who plays him, Colin Firth. A great read and a great movie to go along with it!"
5,One of the best book ever written.,"I read this book for the first time in high school and I feel like I owe it to my english teacher for introducing me to the world of Jane Austen. Pride and Predjudice is hands down my favorite novel of hers. I am so impressed with the superbly written dialogue and consistency of all the characters. While reading it, my mind became enraptured with the story and I felt like I was actually a bystander in the book observing Lizzy's and Darcy's relationship and how beautifully their feelings for each other evolved throughout the story. This book is definately appropriate for the mature reader as well as the young at heart. Thumbs up to the great Jane Austen!"
4,Great Value - Though Not a Complete Works,"Firstly, in regards to the comments by ""able baker"" - the book they're referencing is Jane Austen's complete works BUT it is one book. I'd much rather have each individually. The three books included are some of her most beloved stories, which is a great starting point for a new fan. The books are complete and unabridged, so there is nothing missing. It's a great set for the value, each book is only $2.66! You can't even buy used versions for that low of a price. My only complaint is that the actual box is rather flimsy and I'll probably end up throwing it away."
1,Not very good value - READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY,"This edition isn't such good value - here you only get three of Jane Austen's books. You can get all eight of them for only a few dollars more - take a look at this edition:0954840119(that's the ISBN number - copy and paste it into the Amazon search box, and the book will come up)."
2,Maybe you can do it if you've done origami before???,"Certain folds are impossible to figure out from the pictures and arrows. For example, in the ""Swan"", step 4 shows what looks like 3 folds... I think. And then a triangle like shape seems to be the result in step five. The step they show does not make any sense.I had to figure it out from the picture of how it turned out. After twenty minutes, I got it, but with no help from the directions given.Many other pictures show a fold that you later figure out, were supposed to leave part of the bill out of the fold (Did that make much sense... No? Now you know what the book is like.).Yes, it is possible, but I'm thinking a video or personal instruction might be better for a first time origami guy like myself."
3,good but tough,"The book has some great ideas but the directions aren't easy to follow. They seem to skip steps and you are left trying to figure them out. A decent book, but not for beginers. The 2 best books I own for $ Oragami are ""The Buck Book"" and ""The guide to Hawaiian-style money folds"". Great directions with pictures."
1,Save your money,"I was really disappointed with this book. The folding instructions were unclear and difficult to follow. The author could have used 10 times as many words in his folding instructions. The diagrams were of little help, as he often included three or more steps in each diagram, and took many liberties with how the finished product would look. I greatly prefer The Buck Book, which talks you through the difficult parts with humor and advice. The illustrations in The Buck Book are much clearer as well, often showing your where in the artwork on the dollar bill your folds should land. Granted, this book describes many more folding designes than The Buck Book, but what good are they if you can't folloew them and give up in frustration after the third fold?"
4,Definitely not for beginners. But a nice resource.,"I was a little nervous when I ordered this book, because of the concerns voiced by some other readers. But I say that if you are an experienced folder (or at least know how to read the randlett-yoshizawa symbols well) you should have no trouble--and may be pleasantly surprised at some of the models. There are no highly complex models in the book--which may or may not matter to some.I have folded some of the complex models (the rhino and the giraffe), so I really don't believe the instructions are as poor some have maintained. My title sums it up best, if you're a beginner look elsewhere, if you're experienced consider purchasing it."
5,Fantastic device for busy people,"This slingbox is fantastic! I use it on both Mac OS X and Windows XP and it works seamlessly with both. It is able to stream live TV effortlessly to laptop, desktop and my Treo 700W (Verizon). I use this primarily while on call at the hospital because the hospital cable doesn't carry a lot of sports stations, but I can also use it to watch movies on HBO, recordings from my DVR, etc. Setup was very easy, but I would recommend setting up the port forwarding manually instead of relying on UPnP (this is very easy to do and the software walks you through it!) to prevent your router from dropping the connection on occasion. I would recommend this device to anyone."
2,Slingbox Review,Slingbox is a cool concept but there are still issues with framerate loss while changing channels on the AV model. While this might be acceptable if you don't change the channel much it was very annoying in our household! I returned it and will probably just get a small LCD TV - you can nevery have enought screens :)
5,TV anywhere: need I say more?,"This will be a short review because there isn't much to say. The Slingbox AV worked exactly as advertized for me. I was even able to do the initial configuration from a remote location using a VPN client. The DSL connection at the location that the Slingbox is installed only has a 60 kBps or so upstream speed, but that seems to be plenty for the Slingbox - the video and sound are smooth, clear, and buffering times are short. For anyone who is not often able to see TV programs at home, this is a fantastic alternative. Highly recommended.Note: Make sure you get the right model, it can be kind of confusing. It basically varies depending on what type of device/connection you want to use with the Slingbox."
4,Worth while for the person on the move,"While the equipment is easy to install, the set up can be a little more involved. The wizards are helpful, and tech support is terrific. But keep in mind, while the technology is somehat simple (slinging tv over ip), the execution may be complex, since there are so many different variables to take in account - for example, brand of router, firewalls, ISP, Cable provider.The pay-off is well worth it. Once set-up, to view TV on my cell phone is amazing. Since I pay $50 for a data plan already, why not gain additional use from it... beats paying another $10/month to Verizon for the somewhat limited VCast Mobile TV.Also consider, Slingbox Mobile may not work on your mobile phone, and the software is another $30... but how cool is it to be delayed at the airport and watch your own Tivo!"
5,Way Cool !!!!!!!!!,"I am a computer/IT professional. This is the coolest thing I've ever seen. Cable TV on my patio.. my neighbor's patio... My kitchen. It rocks!Took a whole seven minutes to install and configure. News, weather, movies, network programs... At MY command! Anywhere!Internet setup not explained well in user guide. If you are E-challenged you may need help.The fact that you can do it wi-fi anywhere in range is worth the buy.Picture quality is great with several format options. Nice interface controls and looks a lot like my TV remote!Cool!"
4,A cakewalk!,"Slingbox is a great cheapo alternative (150.00)to owning many TV's in those places like home offices and kitchens. Why should I hire 3 more cable boxes and buy TV's when I can use my PC's. Easy setup, great quality and great navigation makes this product great.The cons- only one user can view it at a time...Another words, you cannot broadcast to all PC's."
3,Mac Slingbox user-International User,"MAC issuesIf you have a mac, the slingbox AV is not that easy to configure, especially the Remote Viewing option - which is the reason I bought it. I have a Linksys router and despite that is UnDp enabled, it was impossible to configure it even manually. When I used a Windows PC, using Slingbox software, it finally worked. But be careful, your ISP might block the ports you need to use.International Issues + Remote ViewingI also bought another Slingbox Tuner for my brother who lives abroad and I wanted to watch his TV signal. I happens that Slingbox servers don't allow IP addresses sending signals from abroad. Be careful, don't buy this if you are expecting to such, unless Slingbox has that country flag in their webpage.Slingbox Technical SupportThe people there are quite rude and impatient. They should be more patient especially as configuration issues will involve various products (Cable modem, router, computer and Slingbox) for someone like me a tech savvy guy."
1,Slingbox support is dismal,"I am not one to write reviews positive or negative but my shockingly poor service from Slingbox prompts this review. Beware folks, despite advertising that updating the software is ""free"" and ""easy"" getting help when something goes awry is neither. $50 for the cost of support when Slingbox updated their software and it no longer worked on our MAC and the update didn't work either. Requests to speak to a supervisor - denied. We were directed instead to the fine print on their website that says that technical support is only provided for 90 days after purchase. Hmmmm - what is the chance you will need to update your software within 90 days after purchase? Possible yes, but probable? Mark Wilhelm, the VP of Customer Experience is not putting his valuable experience from his prior work at Apple to good use."
1,"Great Product, When It Works - Poor CS","This product is exactly what I want. A way for me to watch TV in my second home. Sadly, the video won't stream outside my local network. I followed the slingbox online guides, contacted customer support (no weekend hours), and wasted many hours. I'm the computer power user who gets asked computer questions by all my friends and their friends, and let me tell you -- this product is a pain in the butt! If you buy it, be sure to set aside a day to trouble-shoot if need be."
4,Slingbox AV,I use my Slingbox extensively. I work a third shift job where I watch TV while tethered to the internet/Sligbox threw my Black Berry. Not only do I enjoy my favorite SCFI flicks but I ran my security camera system into the Slingbox so I can keep an on my residence. VERY COOL!
5,Happily Suprised,"The setup was easy for a mildly savvy computer/router user. I am most satisfied with the picture quality. It's by no means like watching a DVD on the computer, but much better than say a YouTube video. The ease of use kind of makes me think I should have gone strait to the Solo or Pro, but I think I'll be very happy with this model for now."
5,WORKS AS ADVERTIZED.,EASY TO SET UP AND USE. PICTURE QUALITY FAIR TO GOOD DEPENDING ON THE CONNECTION. WHAT A MARVEL!
4,Slingbox AV,The box works well once it is set up. Picture clarity is better than expected. I get some missed frames when you stray too far from the WiFi source. Overall it is quite good. The setup was almost impossible to accomplish on your own. I had to call the slingbox tech support twice to get the Verizon FIOS router configured to accept external access. The setup instructions and the Slingbox CD did not have drivers for my specific router so the tech had me use generic drivers that ultimate worked fine but the outdated device list just added to confusion during the setup.
3,Satisfied,"This item was received very quickly in the mail. It was very simple to install, although I had to go out and purchase a HD connector it has been a pretty good product."
5,The best techno stuff I've ever bought,This product answers so many questions I wouldn't know where to start Leave it to say buy one and start really getting your monies worth out of that cable bill
4,This is a very cool product,"The Slingbox AV is a very cool product. I use it to send TV to my wireless laptop. That way I can watch live TV or our Dish DVR programs anywhere in the house. I haven't tried to use the Slingbox AV from a remote location. Slingbox customer support was kind enough to help me complete the setup for remote viewing since that part of the setup is more technical in nature. The picture is good to very good. The smaller you set the screen size the better the picture looks.I only rated the product as a 4 of 5 stars because it might still need to be refined more in terms of ease of setup. The picture is not quite as sharp as what you would see on the actual TV, but it is very good."
4,"Slingbox - nice little device, but below marketing-driven expectations","This is a very easy way to accomplish what we all need to do sometimes - to shift your TV someplace else: a computer, a phone, etc.Slingbox would have easily earned 5 stars but they delayed the ""public beta"" launch of their Palm client for way too long. In plain fact most of their development cycles don't keep up with their marketing, which is over the top with promises they can't deliver....even the Windows client crashes a lot over a reliable wireless G connection.This aside, you will like what it CAN do, sometimes you will love it - especially if you lower your expectations from the hype."
4,easy install but definately has computer limitations,i like the ease of install and the convience of watching my tv anywhere but my compuuter freezes up from time to time shows the limitations of watching tv on a computer
1,sling this,I found this product to be useless I returned it a week laterI was told to wait a week other wise i would have have returned itafter opening the box and reading the fine printTo use this product it must have its own cable boxthis product is non mac compatiblethis product has low resolutionthis product will only work on one Pc at a timeand there is no customer service whatever
1,Don't buy if you can't plug directly into router,I have been unable to get the slingbox to work becasue it's located in a different room from my router and the ethernet brdiges that I have tired produces a very weak signal. I'll likely be selling it on ebay
4,Problems with Audio,"The setup was very easy. Online help to set up the router was a breeze. The picture quality is fine, but I am not getting any audio after a very helpful tech person took me through all the paces. Slingbox is sending another SB240-100.Did anyone else have this problem? I have a Scientific Atlantic 8300 HD cable box, Cable modem, Netgear wireless, Latitude D520 laptop, Sony TV.Let me know if we overlooked the solution."
3,"Great, when it works","I have had a Slingbox for a year and a half. After the first couple of weeks setting it up, I used it a lot at my cabin and it was outstanding. However, after the first year it started disconnecting until now it disconnects more than it connects. It now also does this on my home local network. Apparently, according to support blogs, this is common after 1-2 years. The hardware burns out and you need to buy a new discounted slingbox from the manufacturer. I give this sytem 5 stars for its first year of operation and 1 star for its second year of operation. As long as you understand that the purchase is good for only ~ 18 months before you need to replace it, you'll be happy. If you bought it thinking it would last 5 years, you will be disappointed."
5,sling box,This product works very well. My son controls our cable box from Japan. Allowing to veiw all our Verizon FIOS stations. He loves it..........
1,Hook up your security camera...,"Well going on the claim that I could hook up my security camera to it, I went and did just that. Only one problem, you can't record anything. So unless I sit and watch it 24 hours a day it does no good. It doesn't interface with any third party software so again we're out of luck. Contacted the company and they confirmed it. My advice is don't buy this if it's for security."
1,doesnt work,no bad side effects on my chihuahua mix...but it only lasted about 2 days.... i would not recommend this product. try advantix. theee best!
5,In a word: Amazing.,"If I could own only one CD, it would quite possibly be this one. The quality of this live recording surpasses most other albums, and sounds much better than their studio albums, because you can get a feel for what the band is actually like.It has most of the bands best songs, such as Old Apartment, Brian Wilson, If I Had a $100000, among others.If you are a fan of BNL, and lke live music, then this is a Must-Own."
2,"There are a few nuts, but little flavor","Amazon initially sent us one box, not a box of 12. At $17+ this one box of rice was certainly not worth it. Amazon corrected their error by sending us a whole box of 12 boxes. After trying the ""sample"" I would have canceled the order if I had not already paid for it. There are a few nuts, but little flavor. I am using the pilaf as a base, and adding all sorts of stuff to make it usable. I do not recommend it, and may end up donating the rest of it to charity.I had purchased a very tasty rice pilaf mix in the grocery store, could not find it again, and tried this, much to out disappointment. I will keep looking."
5,Actually a seller rating,"I scrubbed out my poorly written comments for BookAlley but was unable to return to correct my mistake. Anyway I received the book in record time and not only is it in excellent condition but it has a lovelier cover than advertised on this page! Hearty thanks to the folks at BookAlley for their promptness, FIVE STARS for their service. Look forward to studying the book."
5,Great!,I own two Sugar Gliders and this is a GREAT and MUST HAVE supplement for them! I mix it with their Gliderade or baby food or sprinkle it on some worms and fruit for them. Just be careful not to put too much because then it gets chalky and they wont eat.
5,Aside from proper temperature; this is the best for captives!,"Many captive reptiles suffer from low calcium/D3 for a variety of reasons (nutritional and sunlight related) ... but this fine product can help turn things around. Please provide it to your captive lizards, turtles, land snails, hermit crabs, and most any other wee beasties you may have, especially if you don't provide lots of UV lighting or access to unfiltered sunlight."
3,Rep-Cal Calcium,"It wasnt long and it was at the door. No stores, I didn't have to wait in long lines, and I didn't even have to get in the car."
3,Just what you expect,"I ordered an extension cable to run my PC sound card through my stereo. Lo and behold that's exactly what I got, and at a decent price as well."
5,Much better than I expected,"The customer reviews are so helpful. I was ready to order another table (looked very much like this one) but the reviews were all negative. Ordered this strictly on the very positive reviews and am so glad I did. Gave it to our daughter's kids, age 8 & 15 and turns out their whole family absolutely loves it! Such a convenient set up.......just fold down the legs and you're good to go. The balls, sticks, chalk, nets, triangle thingy - all good quality. These days it feels good to spend your money on something that turns out to be better than you expected."
4,nice product,"A real nice pool table to have fun with the family. The pool table is sturdy and has a very good finish and quality. The balls have nice weight to it, making it feel like a normal size ball. Its not really a problem but i would i liked the cue sticks to be a little better quality and have more weight. But in all i am very pleased with the product."
5,Christmas Gift for my nephew,"My 14 year old nephew who lives with me wanted a mini pool table for xmas so I ordered this item. It actually is very fun, sturdy and durable. There is no one under 14 in the home and believe me everyone has enjoyed it. On the weekends late at night I can hear the cracking of the balls I read all the reviews before purchasing and I am glad I bought it. Now I have to find out where to get replacement sticks (a 10 year old cousin broke one)."
1,Confused,"Typical of folks like himself, he does not know the Bible -- take things out of context. I think he is sincere but misinformed and confused. I'd suggest he/you listen to John MacArthur's preaching on John 6:51-59 ([...]) -- some of the verses he misinterpreted that was instrumental in leading him to the Catholic Church. Growing up in a christian home or even attending seminary does not make one a Christian or knowledgeable of Holy Scripture. He is blinded/fooled. I pray that the Lord will open his eyes."
3,Catholicism is still a works based religion.,"I was raised as a Roman Catholic and left the church when I was born again as a fundamentalist. I cannot figure out how this man went to a school like Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and is now defending Roman Catholicism. He uses all the Catholic rhetoric to defend his faith, but what it boils down to is that Roman Catholicism preaches that one is saved by works and that is absolutely wrong according to Scripture."
4,Excellant until the last chapter,"Enjoyed the book although his attitude about the Fundamentalists seems to occassionally get in the way. However, he really lost me with the last chapter, Morals. This chapter was essentially a quick summarization of the same old rigid, shallow Vatican views on marriage, sexual orientation, birth control, etc that has pushed literally tens of millions away from the Church. I was hoping he would have something interesting and insightful to say about that subject.Despite that, I would recommend this book to anyone initially exploring the Catholic faith."
5,Easy to understand,"This book strikes the right balance of providing concise, credible information and providing personal experiences. I found that I just couldn't put it down. It's an easy read that packs in all the most misunderstood topics regarding the Catholic faith. I'd recommend it for any Catholic, anyone looking to learn more about the Church, or anyone in the process of being welcomed into the Catholic Church."
5,Well Done and an easy read,Easy to understand book about the Catholic faith. Great book to give to non-Catholics
4,Born Again,This book has the potential to further greater understanding between Christians. The different religious perspectives are clearly explained by the author who personally experienced participation in both faiths. His unique perspective allows both Catholics and Non-Catholics to discover historical precedents for their religious beliefs.
5,An excellant volume.,"I recently bought this book, and enjoyed reading it. As a one-time Protestant, I can share Mr.Currie's exhiliration. I was born Catholic,but was confirmed Anglican, I rediscoveredmy roots,or ours,five years ago. Its great toread Mr. Currie's story,and share my experiencesonce again. If you are a Protestant, or not,or have Protestant friends, this is an excellantbook for apologetics. You will read it again and again!"
5,Explains Away Common Objections,"As a 20 year veteran of fundamentalist preaching and teaching, I was wary of joining the Catholic Church. I was attracted by the sacred traditions and reverence for the Lord in Mass, but I had many reservations, about praying to saints and the Virgin Mary among others. Currie addresses these and many other issues in an informed and credible manner. I became convinced that Catholicism was Biblical and truly Christian. I am now a Catechumen, preparing for baptism into the Catholic Church on Easter Vigil this spring. This is a clear and well-written book that addresses common issues to those new to the Catholic Church and explains these issues to my satisfaction. I already bought a second copy to share with others and will buy more. Read this book."
5,The best of its kind,This is a wonderful book that I would recommend to all non-Roman Catholic Christians. I have bought this for all of my fundamentalist friends (though I don't think any of them have actually read it). Much better than Keating's 'Catholicism and Fundamentalism'
5,Clear and easily understandable.,"This book provides such a clear and understandable picture of the differences between Catholics and Evangelicals! As an adult convert to Catholicism, I found this book a great resource for explaining our Faith to Protestants. Actually, I'm not a convert--I've just returned home to Christ's Church!!!!"
5,MUST READ,"This book is a must read for anyone who thinks the Catholic Church is totally wrong. It is a personal story of a man who thought his faith was the only one and Catholicism was just plain wrong. I think people would really understand Catholicism if they only understood what it actually was. People often believe what they are told (by non-Catholics lol) and fail to look at the facts. Every Catholic, and non-Catholic, should read this book."
5,Personal Journey,I read this several years ago and was touched by the author's personal journey in life and his discoveries that lead him to become Catholic. His story resounded with my own story as I left my Catholic Church in my early 20s and returned after finally learning the content of my faith that had never been taught or encouraged in me. So I related to many of David's experiences and gazed in wonderment at his experiences that were different than mine. I recommend the book as a beautiful journey of personal faith for one man.
1,Born Fundamentalist Born Again Catholic,"I was doing okay with David Currie's explanations until I came to the chapture on the Bible. When an author leaves out a Bible translator as important as John Wycliffe (1320-1384) who did include the Apocrypha but with the explanation of ""without the authority of belief"", then I have to question the motive of that author. Also in the chapture on Premillennialism and Eschatology Currie says that Paul in Romans 11:17-26 says that the ""original branches (jewish Isreal) were cut off from the tree and new branches (the church)were grafted into the root. I don't know what Bible Currie was reading but all the ones I have refer to SOME of the branches being broken off. Currie's book, like all the others I have read on the subject, seems to be explaining why they left the Protestant Faith, and not why they turned to the Catholic Faith."
4,"Old school, but a nice change.","This 1979 anthology gathers three of suspense writer MacDonald's (creator of Travis McGee) science fiction novels: ""Wine of the Dreamers"" (1951), noted for its idea of ""long-distance telepathy"" (from lightyears away, to boot); ""Ballroom of the Skies"" (1952); and ""The Girl, The Gold Watch, & Everything"" (1962). Wordy, old-school male adventure fiction of the 1950's doesn't really hold up well now, but the style was a nice change from the slick and gritty prose of most contemporary novels."
3,Great writer; okay Sci Fi,"I think MacDonald is one of the finest suspense writers of the 20th century. His Travis McGee series alone is one of a kind fiction. There are not great McGee novels and poorly written ones. He maintains a high level of skill and drama. Of course, he was also prolific. I'm not sure exactly how many titles he wrote, but it has to be over thirty. Now, to his science fiction. He didn't write a great deal of sci fi. Perhaps it was only a phase. This book includes his three works and I read them all---so they kept my interest. However, they did not leave me awestruck or terribly impressed. I thought he would integrate his famous philosophy-of-life excerpts into the novels but he includes very little. If you like MacDonald and want a flavor of all his stuff, then pick up this book. Otherwise, it's not his finest work."
4,Stay dead this time.,"I have to say I have read a few of Lain's books and I generally walked always feeling they were rather cookie cutterish. While this one wasn't that action packed, it was fast paced and the ending was spot on. I enjoy it when the hero loses. I mean really loses; not that watch-me-come-back-in-a-later-chapter-better-for-my-lessons-learned crud most stories have and for that fact, this book was powerfully refreshing."
4,Hero story with a twist,Stackpole delivers a well crafted hero story that stands out from the usual entries in this genre. The only reason it didn't get five stars is due to the authors tendency to skip or gloss over events that he then refers to later. IMO if its important enough to reference then spend more than a page or two on it.
4,a stand alone book,"""A Sword for the Immerland King"" draws you in gently with it's characters and plot that feel familiar in another world. Strong value and conviction are woven with a skill to intrigue both young and old. It's proverbs and plot open your awareness, nudge you to think beyond what you have, tell you a simple story about love and hate and humanity and beyond. Read it and pass it on."
5,Great Page Turner of a Book,"Well I read this book over a period of three days, and every minute of it was enjoyable. Even if you don't necessarily like fantasy or sci-fi, there is much richness and depth to the schemes, characters, settings and time period. Just about anybody would find this a delightful read. Throughout the story there are many philosophical and interesting viewpoints and lessons that are not normaly found in adventure stories. Along with a very unique plot and interesting facts about an unusual central theme, blade smithing, the diverse adventures throughout will keep you involved in the book to the very end."
4,A Sword for the Immerland King review,"I enjoyed being able to spend some time with the people in this book, seeing their planet, moons, customs, and expectations. I think that Faller shows particular imagination when describing the people, places and particulars of each. It fascinates me to think of how he thought through the story enough to place hints, objects and people in the front of the book that were not revealed until the end.The only thing that seems a bit labored was the length of time spent on the actual making of the sword.Overall it was a wonderful book. I look forward to the next book by this author."
5,Transcending spiritual stereotypes,"In crafting a spiritual book without using stereotypical spiritual ""language,"" F.W. Faller has handled a sensitive area of our lives with a gentle strength that entertains as well as inspires. From the strong ""hook"" of the first chapter to the resolution and further anticipation of the last, it kept me coming back for more. The characters and their environment, in spite of being ""other-wordly,"" are easily identified with and relatable."
5,Take an Adventure -- and bring your family!,"The Sword of the Immerland King captivated me with a story in the epic proportion of the Lord of the Rings. With exquisite imagery and just the right balance of suspense and imagination, the author succeeds in creating a book that you never want to put down. Personally, although I read dozens of books a year, I'm not an avid fiction reader. But since I knew this author, I thought I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. I finished it in less than a week and now I'm reading it to my two boys (8 and 6) who only complain when I stop reading to them!Fantastic job! I am hungry for the second volume."
5,"""Rings"" with a conscience","Here is more than just science fantasy (altho there is plenty of that), here is a story of relationships, with more complex feelings than just fear or attraction. F.W.F.'s writing is still simple enough to keep the interest of a middle schooler on up, with no language or situations that would be considered offensive.He paints great images of scenes in the book, and his descriptive accounts of medieval activities such as smithing let you know that he must have a first hand familiarity with the subject."
5,Excellent for the new computer user,"These books are written in a very easy to read and understand format; if it uses some unfamiliar computer term, it defines it. It is also written in a nice and simple step by step order to bring your understanding of computers/Windows 98 up gradually not to mention its humorous slant. I build computers for my friends and family and I always send these books along with the new computers becuase I think they are the easiest to understand."
3,Enjoyed the lyrical content and up tempo musical style.,"I have her first album ""Scatching the Surface"". This album has a similar style and very good lyrical content. The music is easy to listen to and seems to flow with the words. The Christian message is clear and very uplifting. Thank you Erin O'Donnell."
5,Gifts for Step-mother,"The White Sister was a Christmas gift, so I don't even know what it is about. My step-mother loves the old movies, so I buy from a list she has given me. I know that she has thoroughly enjoyed the movies I have bought in the past."
4,Fairly solid piece,"Pros:Straightforward assembly. Generally quality construction of the parts, specifically the table top. Very attractive look. Good pricing through Amazon.Cons:Some fit and finish irregularities, specifically with the doors. Not deep enough for most modern receivers, so the rear panel needs to be modified or excluded.Overall a very nice piece for the price (at Amazon, anyway). Look is very solid and high end, with a nice faux finish on the very substantial table top. The construction is well illustrated, and can be completed in under an hour. The doors fit irregularly, even with repeated adjustments, making a perfect finish impossible. The piece is shallow for an entertainment center, so I was forced to modify the rear panel to account for the depth of the receiver and its cabling."
4,Exceeded Expectations,"Very pleased with this product!!Overall experience was great. I purchased item on a Friday (late afternoon) and received product the following Tuesday. The fast delivery definitely exceeded my expectations.Assembly: The assembly took a little over an hour. The instructions were vague. We did encounter an issue with the middle door. When we first assembled the door, we did not realize a screw was not tight enough and this caused a gap in between the left side door and the middle door. Once we realized the screw was not tight enough, the issue was fixed.For the price, this stand is fabulous and it looks gorgeous in the living room. The compartments are an okay size, we did have to remove the doors before putting in our cable box and DVD player...but they did fit."
3,Not bad for the price,"Not a bad for the price. Once you take the time to put it together it turns out pretty nice. As many of the other reviews I read stated, there was some damage to the piece. Fortunately for me I am using it against one wall so that leg isn't seen so I did not bother to try to return it. Looks good with all my equipment- dvd player,cable box, VCR and receiver with surround sound speakers, as well as my 52"" LCD TV."
4,Good Stand but bad delivery,"I wanted to buy a tv stand before I purchased a tv during the holiday sales. The estimated delivery date was the 16th then Pilot Deliverers tracking said the 23rd so I called and set up an appointment for the 24th. Only times available was 4 to 6 pm, ok so I take an hour off work and they dont show up so I call and they say the van broke down but will be there within the hour. Ok so I wait an hour and nobody shows up but I do receive a phone call about 15 minutes later saying that my package is on the other side of the state and not even on the van. Great now they want me to take off work again the next day, finally talked them into a delivery time after 5 so I dont have to take off from work early. When I finally received it, it was in good shape and is a nice TV stand.I do recommend this TV stand but I will not recommend Pilot Deliverers."
3,Decent item priced a bit high,"The item is really nice, however a piece came damaged (replaced by company who makes it, not the company I purchased it from - Electronics Depot). It scratches very easily, and you have to put it together which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. Overall quality is good, but for that price, I would've thought it was better quality."
1,Terrible customer service,"While the quality of the item seems slightly above the norm, customer service from this company is dreadful. My new equipment sat around in boxes waiting for a replacement for a damaged shelf that was delayed, then delayed again, by mix-ups on the company's part. Their refusal to budge an inch from their standard process, even though it meant further delay for a very unhappy consumer who had gotten tired of run-arounds and excuses, is a far cry from the real customer service I've experienced elsewhere. I will never buy another TechCraft item."
4,"Great stand, nicks easily","Great TV stand -- even fits the 67"" Samsung DLP we have (0.25"" overhang on each side, no big deal). Looks very nice, assembly was easy. My only issue is that the finish seems to nick/scratch very easily, revealing the lighter wood underneath. So buy a touch-up pen.The shipping was an issue -- the original tracking number given via Amazon didn't match at all with the shipping company CEVA, so the item was lost for about a week before it got delivered. It just showed up one day.A note on the assembly -- depending on your AV receiver, it might be best for heat dissipation reasons to leave the backing off. Also, I found it useful to bore several 1.5"" holes through the vertical boards inside to allow me to efficiently run cables and not have the proverbial ""rats' nest"" visible behind the stand.Great product, great price, track the shipping carefully."
2,Techcraft Veneto TV Stand,"I purchased the Techcraft Veneto TV stand because we have small children that I want to keep away from the TV components. We ordered the larger, 3-door model in hopes of using the Techcraft mounting bracket to mount a large flat screen TV about the credenza without having to mount it on the wall.The unit was VERY tedious to assemble. In addition, the wood scartches and chips really easily and because the wood color is dark, the scratches and chips show a lot!I think the unit will serve its purpose of keeping the children away from the cable box and DVD player but I am sad that it show wear so easily."
4,Solid purchase,"Bought the unit through Restockit.com and it arrived the day before the 5 day window in which it was scheduled to come. Very happy with that. And the unit itself. There were a few tricky details in figuring out how to put it together but not bad overall. One thing to keep in mind - when you measure the equipment you plan on putting in the unit, make sure you include the width of the DOORS for comparison. My stereo fits fine otherwise, but because I put the doors on first getting it in was a lot harder (had to use odd angle). Even if you put the doors on after, any future adjustments, cabling, etc. could be more difficult w/out taking them off again if the equipment is too wide.But unit is great, looks beautiful and I'm very happy with the purchase."
4,Great TV stand,Received this TV stand and it was in great shape. It took awhile to assemble but it looks great in the living room. I am very happy with the purchase.
5,Embrace the twoDness,This is a perfect linear game that has a very unique gameplay style. Atlus always is innovative with their games and odin sphere allows you to use up to five different characters separately. Playing each adventure is a pleasure in its own as you watch them struggle internally and fight demons and fight for love.
4,"Geat Game, Horrible Lag.....","This game had some of the best voice acting on any platform, the graphics are very good even for the PS2, gameplay had the right idea along with the story.The ""BIG"" thing that holds this game down is the major slowdown during battles. This really irritates me along with many others that witnessed this themselves.When you are up against many enemies at once its like the game suddenly went into slow motion. You are dragging beating all your enemies untill the screen is all clear of them.This game would have been a 5star for me if it was not for this.Game's like this would make a lot more money and have many more fan's if developers took the time to fix things like this. Even if they have a deadline to release their games.""The more effort you put into it, the more you will get out of it"""
4,Great Old School Side Scrolling,"Odin Sphere is a great game, fun to play with AMAZING graphics. It feels like your playing a children's painting. The story is well written and draws you in. Even if it starts as the typical RPG fair. At least nobody is missing their memory. All in all a great game, works great on a PS3 too. If you can grab a copy definitely worth a buy."
3,a mislabeled hack'n'slash that should've been an animated film instead.,"This is a damn charming game. If you're looking for a style of animation strongly reminiscent of Yozhik v tumane's trademark animation techniques, I highly recommend this game to you. This game oozes with beauty.Recommendations stop there. Simply having an inventory and interesting story doesn't make a game an ""RPG"". This is a hack'n'slash game. If that's your thing, cool. It's not mine, though. I find repetitive and shallow gameplay to be a bad thing.That's not to say I didn't enjoy it. I played an hour into it and let someone else take over, so I could merely savor the sweet, sweet beauty and awe this game offers. Download some videos of it or something. It's really quite a thing to behold."
4,Great,"Let me add a little praise for this game as well. Since all the positive points have been hit on, let me say some of the little niggles that set the game back a bit.For one, combat can get repetitive. You only have one ""combo"" that you can perform, and special moves take a while to fill up. Basically each map is the same, enemies ""spawn"", you defeat them and you're allowed to progress. I guess what elevates the game is the animation and characters, and the strategy involved in the big boss battles and regular enemy fights. The limited combos though sorely hurt the game and keep it from that true 5 star rating. Basically it boils down to how quickly you can tap the x button over and over.Should you pass this game up? No, this is one of the few games in a while I actually purchased, and it was worth it. It's too bad it couldn't have been more though."
4,odinspheare,tHIS GAME HAS GOOD GRAPHICS AND IS FUN TO PLAY. BUT IT REALLY NEEDS A STRATAGY GUIDE OR SOMETHING TO USE TO GET STARTED.
2,Overrated,"""Odin Sphere"" has garnered a LOT of acclaim. Indeed, it's graphical design has made for a unique game, as the colorful 2-D images come to life like no other I (or anyone else, judging by the stellar reviews) have ever seen. The game has a deep story.Unfortunately, it's not very fun to play. Moreover, it is incredibly difficult. Now, difficulty isn't a bad thing in a game, but this one really takes the cake in that regard. Some bosses are absolutely murderous, forcing the player to power up incessantly (both to increase strength as well as garner funds for powerful items). Moreover, running back and forth on a 2-D plain, slashing at enemies attacking in the air and on the ground, isn't exactly an original idea.I don't want to spoil any of the story, as it was strong and often helped an otherwise poor offering. But all in all, I would wait for this game to hit the twenty dollar bin. At fifty bucks, it just doesn't deliver."
2,Generic Action RPG,"After playing countless Shin Megami Tensei games, I though, ""Hey, Atlus published this, it should be good"" and bought it on a whim. After playing this for an hour, it's an complete letdown. You repeat the same attack combo for every enemy, and cast some magic occasionally. The stamina bar is reminiscent of Demon's Souls, one gets punished for button mashing, but it's still a bad game overall. I'm not that long in, but the story bored me the moment this bad boy dark knight fellow just slaughtered the heroine's lackeys, and just spared the heroines live as he was holding her in his arms, his sword ready. Even after killing countless, he just spared her life and said ""this battle don't need anymore bloodshed."" Story reaks of genric weaboo stereotype Story is bad. Gameplay is bad. Stick with better RPGs like Demon's Souls or Persona 3 instead.."
4,Following Your Heart,"There are very few manga artists that can produce wonderful works of art and creativity together. Yu Watase is one of these rare artists and she is one of the best. I own many of her manga and Alice 19th is one of them.This is a story that will capture your heart. A classic tale of a young girl who finds the courage within her to save the people she loves. I don't want to ruin the story by telling you all what happens but I will tell you that it is a must have for those of you who enjoy love triangles and stories that have magic in them. A girl who was always shy and insignificant becomes the one who can save the world from evil.Laughter, sadness, love, determination, and friendship encircles this story and brings to life the characters to the audience. Any manga that Yu Watase produces is guaranteed a story of epic proportions."
4,HeatMate Portable Kerosene Fan,"This is a good product, and does what the ad says it will. It was our second choice, after looking for another heater, a brand we already own, which was no longer available. The older heater is far better, but this one is also very good, and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone needing a product like this. Our older one we use in a vacation home in Mexico, where the electricity is erratic. This one we use in a basement studio, which has no heat at all. It heats up the whole space pretty well, but does a fine job in whichever immediate area it's in. The kerosene smell is minimal, and just when it's being lit, which we do outside, and then bring the heater inside. It does it's job well, and we've had no problems with it to date."
5,Great Heater,"I bought this heater for my dad and he loves it. He said it only smells for a brief minute when starting and stopping it. This is natural for Kerosene heaters. If you use good quality kerosene it will keep the smell, if any, to a minimum.It only takes a few seconds to lite and is at full flame within a minute.The fan is whisper quiet and barley noticeable. The fan plugs into the wall but the ignitor requires batteries.I would buy one of these again especially at this price. ($130 shipped)."
5,Ultimate Edition - Basic King Tut dance 101 - Popping Dance Basic,Length:: 2:09 MinsUltimate Edition - Upper Body King Tut Dance - Popping Dance Level 2 to 3
5,Funny Iris,"I wish that Just Ask Iris were a series because her life is so funny! She has a lot of problems throughout the book such as getting a bra. She makes money and lots of friends that she can turn to, even the crazy Cat Lady. I like the way she figures things out and how on every page there is at least 1 laugh. I recommend this book to girls 8 and up. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."
2,Perennial Sweatshirt,"I am not very happy with this sweatshirt, it runs 1 size smaller than your normal size and it very snug around the waist. I have ordered other hoodies like this and the size has been perfect."
5,Agree about the difficulty with mouth,"I agree with the other reviewers on the ""mouth"" being difficult to act with. What is interesting is that we have 9 puppets and this model in particular is difficult to use. Others (like the chef) are not. The difference seems to be that the king has a significantly different shaped head with a more ""protruding"" chin. The problem basically seems to be that my thumb does not have as much room as with other puppets (other puppets your thumb actually extends past your fingers). With your thumb positioned slightly behind your top fingers, it tends to be slightly uncomfortable.However - this issue has not caused much complaint for me. If I was performing for Broadway - maybe I would want my money back, but for now my 3 year old doesn't know the difference."
4,Cool puppet but mouth is tricky to use,"I was a bit surprised that the puppet was smaller than i thought it was going to be. It became more clear to me after messing around with it, that it's probably meant more for a childs hand. Im an adult male with medium size hands and i, like another reviewer had a bit a difficulty making the mouth move the proper way. It was just a little sloppy to control as my top of mouth fingers felt like sliding around alot and not able to maintain a good firm control of the mouth movements. Other than that issue, i think this puppet is exceptionally made and would be a great puppet for some kids or even a mom who wants to perform for her kids. If your a dad thinking you will be able to use this toy with much use, you might want to look for some bigger stage puppets as you will find your hand barely fitting into the head."
2,Hands slip out of the mouth,"I bought this puppet and 3 similar M&D puppets (the knight, the dragon, and the princess) and my fingers tend to slip out of the mouth when attempting to make the lips move. For this reason, I've yet to put on a performance that doesn't end with the puppet cussing. My fingers (average size male) simply can't get a grip on the inner mouthpiece! I agree these are great quality, very whimsical and well appointed--but FUNctionality gets a 2/5. I'm surprised not more people have mentioned this flaw."
4,King Puppet Matches up with Queen Puppet,Melissa and Doug produce well made products. I am always comfortable buying anything from them. Grandkids will enjoy them for many years to come.
5,Love Melissa and Doug Products,Love Melissa and Doug products. These puppets lived up to the quality that one expectsfrom the brand. The colors and textures are great. The kids love them!
4,Solid,"I've been wearing this bracelet for at least two years now. In and out of the shower, playing golf, rarely take it off. Still looks the same as the day I bought. Does it actually work? I don't know, but it doesn't hurt."
2,Hard To Follow,"A strange, confusing, and just plain weird show. The first time I saw it, I didn't have any idea what was going on.It took me about three viewing to figure out the plot. Some good scenes here and there, but very strange"
1,The worst episode of the series,"This was one bomb of an episode with horrible acting and an insult to the intelligence. The Enterprise encounters turbulence and find a deserted planet with a single life form one minute, and none the next. It turns out to be a very delusional man named Lazarus, who actually has two halves, one sane and rational, the other paranoid and psychotic. I don't know anything about the actor who played Lazarus; he looked like a sort of druggie and motorcyclist, but nevertheless, he was from another planet and flew in a time travel spaceship, one that looked like it was built out of junkyard parts in a matter of minutes (of course you won't see it fly). Avoid this one completely, unless you love bad acting and a confusing story"
1,Worst Episode of the Original Series,"This episode makes no sense whatsoever. The characters say one non-scientific thing after another. Surprisingly, the science in Star Trek 2009 makes more sense. As a result, this is the worst episode in TOS. Stay away! You have been warned."
2,"Nice Idea, but Too Flat","The episode begins promisingly enough, with an unexplained shake-up and a hint that the galaxy is about to be invaded. The action never surfaces, however. The only conflict takes place in a not-quite-psychedelic realm between two galaxies where two silhouettes engage in hand-to-hand combat every ten minutes or so. It's not clear who is who or even who we should be rooting for. It's confusing and there is a strange lack of satisfaction when the conustion is resolved.The episode plods along and would have deserved a one-star rating if not for a bit of extremely noble martyrdom performed by a lead character.This episode is in no way vital to the success of the series as a whole."
2,Strange plot that is hard to understand,"""The Alternative Factor"" is one of the worst episodes of the original Star Trek. Spock and the crew find what seems to be a dead planet. Kirk finds a man named Lazarus and they beam back up to the Enterprise. They later find out that Lazarus is a time traveller and there's a mysterious being on the dead planet that he says is actually a person trying to interfere with his time travel. Lazarus will do anything to get some crystals so he can get in his flying saucer and get off the planet as soon as he can.""The Alternative Factor"" isn't the worst episode of the original series, but it's not one of the best. The plot is strange and it makes you wonder what it's even about at times. I wouldn't recommend getting ""The Alternative Factor"" unless you're a diehard Trek fan."
1,Could Have Been Great,"It is such a shame. This could have been a great soundtrack if it only included ""Feel My Ubiquity"" by the Jesus Twins"
4,On Our Second Copy,"My daughter adores her second copy of this book; both times she slept with the ""Secret Mermaid Handbook"" under her pillow until the thrill faded. There's just something about mermaids that mesmerizes little girls--all that glitter I suppose. My daughter loves all the jewelry that goes with the story, though trust me--you will lose the press-on earrings very quickly. (Most of the other bits are pretty sturdy, however, particularly the little frame at the end.) The story itself is only so-so, but some of the little asides by the characters make it a bit more tolerable for the adult reading the story, and there are much worse books of this sort on the market. I know my 4 year old would give this 10 stars if she could."
5,A wonderful book for little girls to read over and over.,"Every little girls should get this book. It is filled with beautifully illustrated pictures, very cute and an inviting story."
3,Not as described,"The picture advertizing this kit CLEARLY shows that it comes with a power point that you can hard wire. And it CLEARLY states that you can free up your in dash power points with the hardwired adaptor. This kit that I recieved from Sattelite Radi Superstore does NOT come with that piece. And they claim that for some reason, Amazon puts that piece in the picture. Just to be clear - the kit from SRS DOES NOT come with the hardwired power point. This would certainly be helpful information when you think you are ordering EVERYTHING that you need to do this install. I do not know who is at fault, because both parties will blame each other for the dissatisfactory advertising. Not very happy about my purchase."
5,Sweet,This is a must for anyone who wants to hear sat radio on an older style head unit. with this unit you will have zero static on 88.9
1,did Not work for me!,"ordered it for hook up with my XM, product cannot work for my car there go useless does any body need to buy a adapter for your sat radio system's"
1,Defective XM FM Adapter,Extremely disappointed as it did NOT work! I had to drive an hour to get another one (plus the hour back!!)so my local store could finish the installation. I couldn't believe it when they said it didn't work! Now I just need to get my money back. Thinking it is not a good idea to buy electronics from AMazon as now there is the hassle of getting my money refunded!
2,Piss Poor,"Installed in my 1996 Civic to an XpressRC. Sound quality was poor. When you would switch from FM to XM the sound levels where vastly different. FM sounded normal but XM had minimal bass and treble and the overall sound volume level was lower. Every time I would switch between the two I would have to readjust or change the volume level. Very annoying. I couldnt live with it. Thankfully my Honda had a cassette unit and I was able to use the cassette that came with the XpressRC to use. The sound quality is incredible, even better then FM and there is no need to change the volume levels when switching between the two."
1,Defective merchandise,Unfortunately the item was defective as received and the XM radio would not work. Luckily the folks at Best Buy (who were installing the XM radio) were nice enough to swap out the FM Direct Adapter without charging me.
1,produict did not work!! Local tech said it was inoperable.,Product did not work at all. Local tech said that product was not operable and would not perform as stated. Can money be refunded withouit sales paperwork?
4,A vey good addition to satelite radio.,I was getting static from my FM radio and this solved the problem. I installed it in a GMC van and needed to buy the antennae adapters. They should be sold here.
5,Works Great,If you live in an area where there are a lot of radio stations then this product is a must. When you turn on your XM receiver it will automatically turn off your outside antenna. Your FM modulator will not have to fight with the other radio stations in your area and it will give you good clean sound though your FM radio.
5,Great Product,This product is so good it over powers radio stations that would come in the best in my area! It is easy to self install for someone that has alittle common since. Again this product is great! No more static!!
3,Sky Cries Mary - 'Moonbathing On Sleeping Leaves' (Warner Brothers),"Seattle's own Sky Cires Mary with their third major label release here provide fans with yet another seventy-minute plus slab of rather stylish,progressive and inspiring indepth sounds.Husband and wife team of Roderick and Anisa Romero share the vocal duties through out the CD's fourteen cuts.Anisa's voice is pleasing,yet strong as most SCM fans would know.Tracks that are most impressive are ""An Ant,The Stars,An Owl And It's Prey"",""Moonbathing"",""Ringing"",the instrumental ""Smoke Break"",the techno-like ""Nowhere"" and the low-key ""Insectoria"".Check out some of their other available titles."
2,"Not ""good"" condition","This item is in ""very used"" condition. This item is missing the paper dustcover that typically wraps a hardcover book. The hardcover itself has bended and frayed corners. Worst of all, it has a handwritten dedication on the inside title page!!"
4,A Blessing!,"The first time I heard this man sing was on Moody Radio the song ""Nothing Else Matters"" and this man's gifted voice truly blessed and ministered to me and I had to find out who is this man. Yes Marvin Sapp does sing this song too but this is the man that actually wrote the song along with his wife. Well I had to get the CD even though it is out of print and can only be purchased through amazon. The rest of the songs minister as well: ""You are my solitude"", ""There is a river"". Israel also sings the ""Nothing Else Matters"" on the CD titled ""Real"" so purchase it."
3,Great for kids.,"I bought this at a dollar store a couple of years ago for my son. He loves it, and it has become a halloween tradition to listen to it every year!"
5,Best bluetooth for truck drivers!,"I drive a truck and found out how hard is finding a good bluetooth headset. Many I have tried worked fine, but the biggest problem was that other party could not hear me (because of engine noise). When I accidentally found this one I gave it a try. And it is awesome. People think that I am talking straight to my phone. Call quality in my opinion is even better when I use this headset.PROS:- perfect voice quality- battery lasts long- noise cancelling microphone makes others to hear you- solidCONS:- bulky- expensive (but worth this money)"
4,Works very well,"These bluetooth headphones work really good except for one small thing. When you turn them on, they don't automatically take calls from the phone. You have to tell the phone to use the bluetooth. But they are the style that my girlfriend wanted and they work very well other than that one minor annoyance."
2,Disappointed,"I drive truck and bought this headset because I needed a boom headset so I could use ms voice command in a noisy environment. The mic works as advertised. I can dial, call from my contacts list or open a program using my normal speaking voice. The problem is hearing. Everyone sounds like they have a mouth full of marbles and it's very hard to understand them. Also, everytime I turn off bluetooth or the headset I have to re-pair it to the phone to get it to work again. My other headset, a Plantronics voyager 510 has great sound but the boom mic is too short and picks up all the background noise in the truck causing mis-dialed numbers but other wise is my every day not in the truck headset."
3,B150 Bluetooth Headset,The product worked great while it worked. It had been returned by a previous customer.I was responsable for return shipping which I do not think I should have been.Still waiting on the replacement.
2,Headset Does Not Function with Windows Vista,"Headset does not function with Windows Vista, March 8, 2007Reviewer: Richard Mccoy (Madison, WI United States) - See all my reviewsI gave a couple of stars to the product as I like its design and because it would function effectively with a bluetooth phone or with a Windows XP PC. It was well rated for use with Dragon Naturally Speaking voice recognition softwareBUT, BE AWARE: This device will not function with a Windows Vista PC and the manufacturer, VXI, is not at all optimistic or helpful about fixing the problem. Buyers should be informed up-front of this problem, but they are not. I returned the headset as it was useless to me."
5,Great stuff,"This is the stuff you want to use on ATV's / Quads. I've used it on my sand tires that have been shaved down ""Comp Cut"". The tires leaked before adding this sealant and have held up for 18 months with no re-treatments.I'm now ordering more bottles to re-treat my tires and my other ATV tires I have.This stuff is great and will not corrode the aluminum rims like Slime does. If you have a shop change your tire for you, they will love this stuff. It is not nearly as messy as the green stuff when changing tires."
3,"Almost, but not quite","This is almost what I was looking for, but not quite. I wanted the ""polished"" look and ""smooth"" canvas to put clothes on. It did smooth me out a little bit, but it does not stay up. I'm a small so I'm thinking I should have bought an xs. Also, it flattens my chest, which is not flattering."
3,I thought this would have...,When I ordered the Spanks Hide & Sleek strapless camisole I thought this would have solved some of my shape isues..I found that it did not have enough support at the top and the large which I bought was too big so I guess I should have bought a medium instead. Anyways I am still planning to purchase other products in this line.
4,Spankful,"I liked the product, however, the size of the item was larger than what the size chart stated."
2,Not what I expected,"This product didn't help me to appear smoothed and held in like I had anticipated. It was like wearing a regular cami, giving me little or no support. I thought maybe I needed a size smaller, but then I don't think it would give me enough coverage on top. I plan to send it back."
4,Great slimmer!,Great stomach pooch slimmer!Cons: I wish it were longer. Also the top portion flattens my chest so that was a big downside. But I just wore it below my bra and it fixed both the length and flattening problem!
3,uncomfortable,"I was excited about this item. A miracle ""buldge"" eraser. I was a bit disappointed on how uncomfortable it was. It's okay for a short period of time. I wore mine to a wedding. I needed to go back to the hotel room and take it off. I was very thorough in finding the right size, so I don't think that was it. Wouldn't do again."
2,Too many editoral changes,"I loved the original paperback version of this book and expected the board book edition to have the same text, But no!! The American editors of this edition thought they needed to change the text for some reason and now instead of counting flowers little wombat is seen as absent-minded, wondering off and getting lost. What happened to counting the ten flowers? The simplicity of language of the original is missing, replaced with a more wordy text.Thankfully the pictures have not changed, I think this is one of the best illustrated books of Charles Fuge so far, it's only the editors changes I don't like. I have memorised the original book so I can still read this edition to my child, ignoring the new text. I highly recommend getting the original version from England or Australia."
1,twaddle,The pics are cute but really this isn't great children's lit. There are so many other good books out there - go find one and buy that instead.
3,A nice collection,"This is a nice art book. It features a lot of the Dillon's illustrations, but my problem with the book was that it was mostly one image per page; the page layouts seemed like they wasted a lot of space. There could have been plenty more to add to this book from their incredible collection. Also, they display small pencil sketches before the final piece, which was a nice touch had they been a bit larger than an inch or two (hard to see!). Overall it is a nice collection of their work, but for what the Dillon's have done, its not a complete or well thought out compilation of their work."
5,Pucca,"This is the funniest show I have seen for a long time and I can't wait to order the DVD's of the series. However, I'd like to know what episodes are on each of the Pucca DVD's. Could someone please submit a list for each release?"
3,More Psychic Roots,I was disappointed; not what I was expecting. No longer sitting on my book shelves.Others probably will have a different opinion.
5,"Sweet enough to eat, but won't make you sick.","Sugar Water is a classic single and amazingly the remixes don't suck! I love BBQ and wish the live version here did not sound like a bootleg, oh well. I highly suggest this one!"
3,Still singing after all these yers,"Gregory Kunde made his debut in the 70's and this is a recent recording. The fact that he can still negotiate the range and coloratura after 25 years or so is remarkable. Most tenors of this ilke do not survive this long. I would assume that he has not ventured from these types of roles and that may be one key. Yes, the voice sounds a bit worn but he does well overalland this recording is another good example of the resurgence of the coloratura tenor, the King of which for me is still Rockwell Blake."
3,kunde is adequate.,"I bought this CD because i heard a clip of Kunde's vocal prowess on a web site called Dutchdivas. in that clip he hits a ""G"" above the tenor ""C"". Having heard this I felt for sure that he would utilize his high tessitura in this collection. Sadly i was disappointed. I do not think that there was a note over a ""C"" or ""D"". on the positive side I did appreciate his ornametation of the florid notes and his legato. but if I was asked to choose between Gregory Kunde or William Matteuzzi, I would choose Matteuzzi hands down. i know that Matteuzzi's voice is sometimes a little shrill, but at least he thrills you with his upper range."
2,The Quotes from Barber are the Best Parts,"The only thing in favor of this is that it isn't as bad as his symphonies, which, after the second or third symphony, tend ever-increasingly to be self-indulgent vats of lard. I bought this and was not too put off, then sprang for the symphonies, but was that ever a mistake. Studying with Rene Leibowitz and playing in an orchestra (which he couldn't sustain), didn't succeed in making Pettersson a professional composer. He is the biggest amateur ever to get boxed sets. In these string pieces there are too many details that sound like the Bartok MUSIC, and the program notes make no mention of the extensive quotation of the Barber Adagio for Strings that Pettersson makes in one of them. I guess if you like Pettersson you're supposed to ignore his quotations. But that would seem to mean they are thefts, and not quotes..."
3,"Based on great classic short story ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" but a little lackluster.","Great set-up, based on a great short story, but really amounted to a Sci-Fi genre flick with a too-tiny budget. I love Michael Rooker in this, as well as Bas Ruten, but many of the others...well, let's say I urged their death scenes along."
3,Bas Rutten rulez!,"If you love action, this movie is for you. The movie stars Bas Rutten of Pride Fighting Championship fame. Nuff said.Btw, Mr Snub. The Mexican that you refer to is the legendary Marco Ruas. The trainer of UFC fighter, Pedro ""The Rock"" Rizzo. And he's Brazilian. Lol!"
3,Nice cheap bike for light use,"I ride this bike once or twice a week for for about ten miles along the seawall. I do not think it would hold up well if I rode it with any greater frequency. Around town the six speed gearing is enough. The brake are great, the crank arms feel flimsy to me. If I wasn't so cheap, I'd get rid of the neither fish nor foul road+knobby tires. I'm slightly cramped by the handle bars, so over six feet should perhaps look elsewhere."
4,Shipping Problems,"It took Eagle EGL shipping a long time to get my bike to me. They didn't have my correct phone number, then when I gave it to them, they couldn't find my item for a while. They finally did, though and everything was OK, it just took longer than it should have to get it."
3,"""The Last Cidadel ""-A lost oppurtunity to tell the story!",I purchased this book with great anticipation. After reading it I am still anticipating being treated to a stratgic review of the final approach to this phase of the conflict. The author's treatment of the this part of civil war history seems disjointed.We get snipets of various encounters between the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomic but with no indepth joining narrative explaining the context and the implication of the outcome. The maps are almost useless in format and connection with the current text. It is possible that Tredueau has done the best job possible with a meager record of this period of history. I still believe however that an opputunity exists for someone to tell a compelling story of this phase of the war.
3,Petersburg under a magnifying glasss,"This book is a in-depth study of the Petersburg campaign in the Civil War.Not fot the causul reader, but for anyone wishing to study the campaign in depth, this is the book for you."
1,Production values about as low as you can imagine,"This is seemingly a poorly guided tour of a 2nd rate Irish farming museum. Broken down old implements (like churns and primitive washing machines, often with missing parts, are poorly demonstrated in fairly poor visual quality. You'll search in vain for lovely Irish thatched roofs or folk art or other interesting things. If you like looking at cracked china, though, this might be just the film for you. By the way, it is not even close to the 60 minutes long it claims to be. I found this to be merciful."
4,Dolphin Wall Clock,"I wanted a clock for a large bathroom and thought this was a very pretty one, so I put it on my Amazon wish list. My niece give it to me for Christmas and I adore it. I have to have at least one clock in each room and this one goes great in the bathroom."
3,bueno pero.....,"Este libro de dietas es muy bueno, hay que seguirlo al pie de la letra para ver resultados, pero, no esperen un gran cambio, solo se pierden unos kilos los primeros dias, luego recuperas unos pocos y luego empiezas a bajar pero lento, yo no tuve tanta paciencia. Pero merece que lo prueben."
5,"The best system to lose weight, you will be amazed!!","By far, this is the best system to lose weight! As most women, I know you most be one who have struggled dieting, and maybe know most popular diets down to a ""t"". I happened to me too, until I read this wonderful book, which changed my relationship with food 100%. Now, I understand that in order not only to lose weight, but to permanently stay thin, you should have a good relationship with most foods we tend to think will make you gain weight, such as sugar and carbohydrates. Mr. Bolio writes this book in such a way you will be amazed by the results. It's a guide for life, and I assure you, based on my experience, that this is indeed your go to option to maintain a healthy eating plan for life, without having to be afraid of, so to speak, eating!"
5,C'mon already!!!!!,"What's the hold up?We need more MP releases! BH 90210 are up to season 6 already!I hope they aren't going to stop, it's already bad enought they changed the design of the boxes!HURRY UP AND RELEASE MELROSE PLACE!!!!"
5,Hurry up with Season 6 & 7!!,"Absolutely love S5 V2 of MP. I am already up to the last episode and I have only had it for 2 days :) Always loved MP. Shame the new series is doing so badly. Yes, it's not that great, but it's great to see Amanda back to her old ways. I wish they had released season 5 as a full set so season 6 would be out already. I am dying to see Lexi, she was my MP fav in the later years. Brings back so many memories."
4,When??,I am starting to get nervous that they might never release the rest of this series!! Does anyone know when it's set for release? Please help a girl out!
2,Good game if you like easy games with no challenges,"this game does have good graphic the gameplay is smooth, but it is way too easy, to easy to the point that I, the first time playing the game, did not lose a point, then I continued to move up in skill level, nothing changed. I beat everyone, at every skill level without losing a single point. I like realistic game, this is not one, so that is why I would not recommend it if you like challenges, you just won't get one here...."
1,A letdown,"I bought this game thinking it would be good but I was thinking wrong. Let me just say that this game stinks real bad. I played Virtua Tennis on the XBOX and PS2 and they were good games. However on this PSP the game is a complete letdown. I don't know if it's just me but during points this game will flicker a bit. Also the players look completly fake. The players play styles doesn't match. I wish this scale had 0 stars because this game is a complete waste of resources. I watch tennis and know the players styles so I know what I'm talking about. If your going to buy this game please don't. If you really want a good tennis game for the PSP get ""Smash Court Tennis 3"" as it puts this Virtua Tennis to shame. I also should mention that the game is a dark.. I just don't like this game at all."
3,A mellow version of the Rod we know and love,I enjoyed the older ballads much more than the songs that he covers on this CD. They don't sound as natural as his older hits. It's a nice soft sound if you want to spend some quiet time with Rod at home or at the office.
2,VERY POOR,"This is a very poor selection of annoying ballads. Stay far away from this one and buy Storytellers instead. Rod Stewart has much talent, but this album shows none of that talent."
4,I so want to give this five stars...,"but the one and only reason I can't is because I like an earlier version of ""Forever Young,"" and the one included on this CD is a recent (1996) version.Besides that one flaw, this is a perfect CD!"
3,Truly In Love?,"For Rod Stewart, many of his collections have scored big and true, with his soulful blues-filled voice, but there are some collections worth projecting that don't always make sense.This collection states that example. The 1996 love songs collection, If We Fall In Love Tonight, reflects on some of Rod's best ballads, with a whole heap of new ballads, and a few new renditions on some old favorites of Rod The Mod, like Forever Young and Have I Told You Lately. Other hits like Broken Arrow, and Downtown Train are highlighted, but not that many other hits are here in this collection.Although Rod Stewart has made several hit songs and albums, this one might be worth passing up if you're a true Rod Stewart fan. Otherwise, it is a nice collection."
4,pick it up!,"I like Rod Stewart, especially the old 70's stuff. What I like about this cd is it gives you a little bit of everything. 70's, 80's, 90's. A few of the re-makes I could do without, but I enjoy this cd and I doubt any Stewart fans would be disappointed."
3,My Thoughts,I loved the song Have I Told You Lately but was disapointed with Forever Young. Rod Stewart sings it slower here than on the radio and somehow it just doesn't come across the same. I am impressed with his rendition of the older songs-he stays true to them. I just wish he would have done the same with Forever Young. From 1 to 10 I give this a 7.
3,I love the song- Forever Young- that's why I bought it,Rod Stewert never was the heart throb type- in my eyes at least- but his music was something to get your heart beating. I fell in love with the song Forever Young and that was how I came to like Rod Stewert- for that song and for others I have come to enjoy
5,Let Newton be!,"This is a book from series of book including Einstein,Quantum theory,The Universe,Chaos,Stephen Hawking,etc.If you like this book,you might want to collect other books in series.The book presented Newton's life and works on science in illustrative,humurous way.It is also factual so for those who want detail descriptions and formal presentation probably dislike.For general reader it is an excellent book.Everyone know that Newton is the great man in science so this book tried to tell you in different way. Also recommended for secondary students.They will find about a giant in Physics in very interesting way."
4,"Quite good, not great.","I would recommend for someone into the Introducing... series, but not one of their best works."
4,Inexpensive and lightweight,"We ordered 10 sets of these pieces for a cub scout expo event, and we needed them fast and cheap. Thats what we got! They ended up being really light and would fall over during the game. I know if the event was indoors and with adults that wouldn't happen as much! We are still happy with the purchase, just plan on glueing a metal nut or bolt to help weigh them down for next years use."
2,A little Small,"I thought these would be bigger than they are. I have an inlayed chess board on my tile counter, and I thought these would be nice to use for it, but they get lost in the 2 inch tiles. They feel cheap, and there is not much weight to them."
5,Just what I needed,"The chess pieces that I ordered arrived exactly as promised. I needed an inexpensive set of pieces that my students could use during breaks, and that wouldn't be expensive to replace if lost.They were perfect for my needs."
5,Extremely helpful!,"This book is very helpful in many ways, but especially in suggesting ways to talk to someone who is having memory problems. Wish I'd had the book much sooner."
1,...,"Don't buy this book expecting another 'pat the bunny'. It starts out ""Let's have fun on the playground! Here's a truck we can take for a tow. But wait-pat the bunny before we go!"" And there's a fuzzy-bellied bunny on the first page - but that's it! There is nothing else interactive in this book - just an ordinary, second-rate board book."
2,PDR: Who pays for publishing?,"This is a decent reference source, but remember that the book is paid for by the drug companies that advertise in it. I do not use it as a pharmacist because I have second thoughts on whether all of the info is unbiased. I think it does show some bias. In addition, drugs are not even mentioned unless a drug company pays to have it in there."
5,Excellent for following along while exercising,"This is my favorite book on yoga. Unlike most yoga books (which are designed for reading, not for following along while doing yoga) this book is spiral-bound and all of the poses for each workout are on a single pair of pages. This way you can lay the book open and follow along while you're doing your exercises. Most other books I've seen I need to open it, look at the pose, mark the page, put the book down, do my pose, finish my pose, pick up the book, open it to the next pose, and repeat. Not this book..... Open it and lay it on the floor, and all your poses for the whole day are laid out. You can workout and never have to touch the book. Nice diagrams and nice explanations.My only minor gripe is that the titles of the poses are printed in light orange, which is sometimes difficult to read against a white background. But maybe that's just my failing eyesight :-)-Andy Frazer"
2,Disappointed by the line art,"We all know that Cyndi Lee is a guru in the industry. So, I was very disappointed that she chose not to use actual photos to depict poses and correct postures, but rather line art."
1,Not worth the price,This dvd is not worth it's retail value. It is almost like watching an episode of skateboarding right from tv because there are commercials right in the middle of the feature. Not worth the money.
4,I wish it was 60 minutes long,I bought this tape thinking it was about 60 minutes long instead I got only 39 minutes. The singers were good but the sound man had the banjo too loud and the singers too low. If you like Irish singing it was far. If you are looking for great sound and an hour long show then I would pass on this video.
3,Educational for My Grandson,"I bought this for my grandson, as his great-grandparents lived in Texas City at the time of the disaster. This story has been told and re-told down the generations of the family, from their perspective. My ex-husband was 7 years old, and remembered that the entire horizon seemed on fire.The video did bring the story to life for us, and placed it in a broader context. While the History Channel tried to dramatize the story a bit, the real drama was in the facts themselves. I was particularly interested in the old newsreels and radio reports that were presented.Worth the price, if you are interested in the Texas City Fire."
1,Misleading Compilation,"I wanted to add my voice to the complaints that this item is a compilation of episodes that are already on different seasons. If people do not read this they are going to think that they are new episodes that haven't been seen and that is not the case. You must be careful to really read these descriptions and I've begun to read thru a few of the first few customer reviews to make sure I'm not buying duplicae material or ho-hum material. I am a huge paranormal/supernatural fan and have been for many many years even when it wasn't a thing that was mentioned about in ""normal"" circles. I particularly enjoyed this series when it was televised on the Discovery Channel and would love to see additional seasons made of it. I think there would be enough fans out there that would enjoy seeing a new season. I have all four seasons and have just rewatched them. Just be aware that New Dominion has released two sort of ""best of"" sets with 8 episodes on each one but they're not new material."
5,Spoiler Alert!,"For anyone purchasing the TV Series ""The Haunting"", which I HIGHLY recommend, this will duplicate some of those episodes. Amazon, in their usual fashion, quickly accepted my return and processed my refund."
4,Botvinnik's decade,"Golombek proved his penchant for chess writing time and time again, as correspondent for The Times and The Observer, his pieces stood out for their clarity, their grandiose and eloquent style and for the passion with which he wrote. His power of communication makes it well worthwhile reading WCC 1954, despite the slight lack of enthusiasm with which one might approach work covering Botvinnik's career through the 50s, which he dominated which such seeming ease. But if there was ever a player to contend with Botvinnik at this time (before the appearance of Tigran Petrosian of course), it must surely have been Smyslov. Smyslov had crushed all the the major opposition by this point, and at the time there must have been serious speculation that Smyslov would actually oust the Soviet strong-arm. Golombek captures some of this tension, and as an expert on Soviet chess, and an observer of the match, is a perfect medium through which to witness such a class of titans."
5,Complete Safety Guide,"This book is an excellent guide to what the Society of American Fight Directors preach--Safety! Fight Master Suddeth details the many traps and common practices that put actors in harms way, then shows us the safe alternatives. It is a guide that should be kept in every theater as a reference for actors, stage managers, directors, etc. It doesn't pretend to teach you how to direct fights--this only comes with intense training--but rather teach you how to protect yourself and fellow artists. Included are details of weaponry and how to maintain them, tips, pointers, tricks, etc.With decades of experience under his belt, this book is an extremely valuable tool if you are participating in any form of staged violence. Don't leave your safety to trial & error."
5,Great,"I loved this show on TV and the songs are very good. I really like ""Blue Skies"" by BT (featuring Tori Amos.) Other tracks I like include ""Closer To Free, Without Letting Go, If You Love, Sunshine Superman, Climb On(A Back That's Strong,) and of course, Free Fallin'"" by Stevie Nicks. I love the artists on here, too. I love the variety. I'd recommend this cd to anyone because it's very good."
3,"Not too shabby, but needs a little work","This CD, in my opinion, isn't that great. It does have some good songs, but they are redone by other artists that totally ruin the song. The theme song is about the only cool song, the rest are blah. If you are truly a Party of Five fan, such as I, you might consider buying it, otherwise steer clear!"
4,"Great Shed for the Price, but they could make easy improvements.","So I've owned this shed since 2006 or so. It was a LONG weekend to install the bulk of it with myself and 3-4 friends (never all at once). Once completely installed, it is quite sturdy. The size is awesome for my yard and provides adequate storage and 'shop' area in one building. Biggest complaint would be that the 'brace' they use in the two mid sections of the 12x24 should also be used at the back of the building. A modified version of the strong bracing could also be used at the front 'garage' door. Regardless, this building is a great value for the money if you have a pad and some time to assemble (and a friend or two).Compare it vs ANYTHING you find online or locally and you'll see that for the $$$ this building is quite nice. With that said, yes you can get better (for a lot more $$$). You can darn sure do much worse for the money as well.Do your research and if you determine this is for you, you're probably right!"
2,poor picture and reference info,I have found that the instructions are very hard to decifer and the copy of my set is a 1oooth copy over and the part numbers are hard to find Unless you have a lot of time and patience have some one build it for you the instructions have all the required info but the love aint there The people at arow should reconsider therer design I found several ways too make it faster and stronger and easier all in one step the money is way to high for a self construct BE AWARE ITS SLOW AND PAINFUL its worth about 750 max
3,Great sound other problems.,"Great sound and electronics.Buttons as has been mentioned, were designed by a moron who never tested them to see if they can be reasonably used. Pioneer should know better. A better design would have been easy.Faceplate delicate. Watch out. I treat mine like a golden russion egg. Dropped it once 2 feet now half the leds aren't working."
5,Review of Premier DEH-P390MP,"This is an excellent product and provides a good quality of sound output without any additional amplifier or equalizer. However, it would have been nice if the remote controller was designed with an eject button. My appreciation goes out to sigmaenterprises (vendor)that supplied me with the Premier model (instead of canceling the order)after their supply of the DEH-P3900MP was depleted."
4,Not quite what I was hoping for.,"I thought that this book was about all aspects of hand quilting, including cutting and piecing. Although this book taught me how to pick a thimble, choose batting, and test markers, I have no idea how to create a quilt on which to use those things.That aside, this book is very thorough in teaching stippling. But if you're wanting to find a book on piecing and patterns, keep looking."
1,Lollipops not of this Earth!,"Not one person, including my 3 yr-old grand daughter, can finish one of these bad tasting sweets!"
4,not sugar free,"everything is great but it has cane sugar.this was listed with the sugar free candy so i bought 2.i have caps on some of my teeth so i can,t have sugar. if they made it sugar free or no sugar i,d buy ALOT more."
1,shouldnt be listed under Sugar Free Lollipops,I bought these thinking they were sugar free lollipops. they shouldnt be under that category becuase they are not. i cant not have these and will donate them to someone who can have them.
5,Super flipping tasty,"Bought these for Halloween. I was pleasantly surprised at the interesting flavor choices and how super duper yummy they were. Nicely done YummyEarth, nicely done."
4,Good & Small enough to help me actually eat much less throughout the day.,"I was eating hard candy to help me get pass the refrigerator and goodies, without pigging out! I could not find good small lollipops anywhere, till I went on amazon.comThe maker of this product actually made these small lollipops so his baby girl, so she wasn't eating lots of sugar and additives, in other lollipops. The fact that they are organic, was an added bonus. The lollipops help with my oral fixations, and, they kept me from overeating.It works for me."
4,My kids love them!,"It's nice to have an all natural (and in this case, organic) treat for your kids. I would have given 5 stars if I didn't think the price was a little steep for lollipops!"
5,What a Great Lollipop for all ages,"I have purchased this product a couple times now and I think they are great. Normally I do not care for the fake taste of may lollipop brands but this one I really enjoy. I also keep them in my candy dish at work. At first people were hesistant to try them (they were not familiar with the brand), but the ones that have always come back looking for more. They have also figured out which ones are the best flavors and which ones are rare. When I refill the dish it is a race for the Mango and Sour Apple flavors (both which I quite enjoy)."
5,Yummy Earth Organic Lollipops,"These are by far the best lollipops around, not to mention they are 100% organic. My kids absolutely love them. And unlike many other customers reviews, I had an equal number of each flavor. I highly recommend Yummy Earth, you will NOT be disappointed."
4,Yum,For myself when I got these I was looking for a better candy that didn't have all that chemical junk in them. And I found them in this candy. I have read other reviews about how it does taste any different then other candy or it taste organic. My opinion is some does taste just like regular candy and some taste organic. So your probably thinking so what so great for me this candy doesnt leave this gross ofter taste and film that regular candy does and doesnt mess with my stomach.
3,"Great taste but ""sugar free""? I don't think so!","For taste I rate these a 10 on a scale of 1 through 5. That means the taste is awesome. However, I was looking for sugar free and these are not--or were not when I purchased them. I no longer see any mention of the sweetener on the product details. If the sugar is not an issue for you, these are really great and I'd buy them again in a minute if I was certain they wouldn't damage my teeth. I have severe dry mouth from meds and lollipops are a mainstay for me. Someone please let me know if these ARE sugar free. One could assume they are since my search criteria was sugar free lollipops, :)"
3,It's not equal amounts of each flavor...,"Just so you know...there was only one blueberry flavored lollipop in the entire container...only 3 mango flavored lollipop and just a few of the other flavors... most of the flavors that were plentiful in the container were razzaberry, and strawberry. I would prefer equal amounts of each flavor."
3,Ymmy Earth Organic Lollipops,"Was very disappointed, package listed Apple Tart, Pomegranate Pucker, and watermelon. There were none of these flavors in the 300 lollipops I purchased."
5,"Great Quality, Great Taste",Loved these! I got them to hand out at Halloween this year and am so happy with them. The container had more than enough for what I needed. I'll definitely be buying these again.
3,Flavors are more grown up friendly,"These were purchased for our 2.5 year old peanut/tree nut allergic daughter. I enjoyed the mix of flavors. Unfortunately, my wife and daughters did not. Almost a year later and the big bucket is still about half full.We got a good value (number of pops per dollar, compared to other allergy friendly candy), but the flavors were a bit too varied to be be popular with our kids or their friends. They routinely picked the dum-dums over these. Granted, you would not expect an organic/natural candy to be as sweet as something artificial. But, if the kids wont eat them then the healthy aspect does no good.I would reccommend these to adults or older kids."
5,Awesome Pops,My daughter loves these and they have no Corn Syrup! Corn allergies are the worst for my daughter. All my daughters love the Apple and Grape. I like the Grape too and never have lollipops.
2,These taste like candies at dollar store or worst!!,"These taste okay, I bought it because I thought it tastes like real fruit, but they are not. Taste just like candies you can buy anywhere on the street or at dollar store.Does not taste like real fruit AT ALL. I will not buy again"
2,Great if you like feeling funny,"I rarely write reviews but wanted to warn others of the affect these lollipops had on me. I've never had any stomach problems and can eat just about anything. However, every time I ate these lollipops, I would get a mild headache and feel nauseous. I really have no idea why but that's exactly what happened. I thought it was a fluke, waited a few days, then tried some more and had the same results. Some reviewers point out the fact that these are made in Mexico and I don't know for sure but wonder if that was part of the problem. Regardless, eat at your own risk."
3,"""Natural Flavors""","There is certainly nothing wrong with these and they are a fine product; however, people should really be aware that the term ""Natural Flavor"" does not mean the flavoring is natural. The flavoring is derived from natural sources via chemical means.Don't let it stop you from buying if you want some more natural source of sugar that has less refinement associated with it."
5,loved almost all the flavours,i bought them for discounted price and loved almost all the favours. The most i liked was mango flavour but i could find only few in my package
3,Why all the hype?,"I've come across this item a few times, but I hesitated to order it. When it was the Deal of the Day I decided ""why not?"" and ordered the 150ct container. Quite honestly, they don't taste that special to me - a lot of the flavors compare with jolly-ranchers. The few original flavors aren't well represented in the mix. For example, out of the 150 lollipops I received, 106 were watermelon (yes, I counted - I was very bored). There were only 2 blueberry lollipops and 3 pomegranate and those were my favorite - they were new and had unique flavors; I can buy a bag of watermelon lollipops that compares with this for less than a quarter of the price! All in all, not my favorite candy. I've satisfied my curiosity by buying it once, but I won't re-order until the flavors are more varied - it can't be that hard to switch them up a bit! Better yet, just sell a bag full of the flavors that are less common."
4,Good,"My daughter loves these! Her favorites are the grape and cherry flavors, however I was disappointed with the watermelon and strawberry. I was expecting a little more flavor...it just seemed to be lacking something...however I feel good giving these to my daughter and for that alone I would rate this a four out of five."
5,The best candy I have ever had!,WOW - these are by farthe best candy I have EVER had.....soooooo gooooood!!I don't even have the words to describe how flavorful they are.Everyone in the family loved them! My son can not eat dye so these aremuch needed and I'll have to keep tons on hand!I am so thankful that there is a product that is safe for my son AND tastes great!
4,A little sour but my son loves them,Good suckers. It's funny because I think they are a little sour but my 1 yr old son loves them. They keep him content when we are out at dinner and he wants to scream..
4,Good suckers not a whole lot of variety,"Good suckers not a whole lot of variety, mostly all one kind despite the flavors mentioned on the carton.150 suckers are a LOT of suckers!!!23 calories each, serving size 3 suckers at 70 calGood flavor!"
4,Got these because they are better than a bunch of carbs!,"I'm always on a diet and slowly eating a lollipop is better than rapidly tossing down some popcorn or chips. Since 3 are a serving and they equal a fraction of what I might otherwise snack on, it's a great idea to invest in a little bin of these in order to slowly go through sugar withdrawal in stead of the rapid painful way I usually do it."
3,TASTE GOOD BUT..,These taste great not too sweet and my kids love these lollipops.but It's not equal amounts of each flavor and It's only 121 counts.26 Wet Face Watermelon20 Googly Grape20 Strawberry Smash18 Pomegranate Pucker13 Sour apple tart15 Mango Tango5 Very Cherry4 Tooberry Blueberry
5,Yummy Earth Organic Lollipops,"I would buy them again. Great tasting and healthier than traditional lollipops.YummyEarth Organic Lollipops, Assorted Flavors, 30-Ounce Container"
2,Those FREE lollipops you get from TD Banks taste so much better!,"I got my 30ounce jar yesterday and after trying out all 8 flavor, they all taste too sour & too much acid to them. I sure don't like them. I'll just give them away at work instead. Don't understand why so many peoples gave such high reviews. If TD Bank sell those lollipops, I would recommend those then this.After having a dozens of this sour lollipops, my teeth begin to hurt. Buy them at your own risk."
4,Assorted flavors... almost,I signed up for subscribe and save shipments of this product. Just got the first shipment. Flavors are good but we only got 2 of the cherry flavor.
5,Yummy!,"I work with special needs kids, some are on the gfcf diet. It's nice to have a snack that everyone can enjoy. They love these suckers, I have to hide them....:-)"
5,the best!,"These lollipops are the best you can find! I can't remember when I had a lollipop the last time (since they are a pure chemistry!!! yuck!) until I found these wonderful organic, all-natural lollipops that my son, my husband and I love, love, love! 5 stars!"
3,Great Tasting Lollipops,These are great lollipops but very expensive for the amount you receive. It is a much better deal to order the 5 lb. bag.
2,Doesn't contain 150 as it is marked.,I received it today. Only got 126 inside. Not 150 as it is marked on the tag. The taste is all right.
4,Organic Lollipops,"I have triplets and they love these and wanted to pass them out for Valentine's Day. These are a better buy than the small packages you can find in the local stores. They received 75 yea's from their classmates and I only got 5 back at the end of the day. There were 3-4 that were broken or the sticks had detached from the candy disc. Those were the oops ones that I claimed, so it worked out well for me. Next year I'll buy an extra bin for home. Great deal!"
5,my kids LOVE them!,I ordered these lolly's for me since I crave sweets in the evenings and these are much better for you. They are super delicious! Even my 9 year old loves them and he hates anything that says organic on them! Great product!
4,Cheeky Lemon is the only flavor I've tried,"Good, but natural lemon flavor may be too strong for some. Unlike ordinary sugary lemon drops, these lemon drops pack a powerful dose of real lemon taste in a small candy. But they offer a truer lemon taste. Just don't try to eat them fast. Each drop are meant to be enjoyed until it completely dissolves and taste lingers in the mouth."
4,Unpopular Candies for Halloween treat,"These candies have different flavors and only 70 calories each.Also, they are organic.For Halloween this year, I purchased a 5 pound bag and left them out side.Hours later, I went out side to see if they were all gone and found only one third of the candies were taken.However, these are organic and taste good. Maybe, more kids will like them next year."
5,Delicious!,"I bought these lollipops for my allergic kids, because these are the only lollipops I have found that don't contain corn. Not only do my kids love them, but so do my coworkers! They are delicious - much more flavorful than your usual boring lollipops. Watermelon is the office favorite so far..."
3,Great taste but some flavors are very rare!,These taste very good. I like them a lot. My only negative is that some of the flavors are very rare. I bought 6 tubs of these 900 pops and combined I only had 12 of strawberry smash. You mainly receive like 5 flavors and a few of the others are just a couple thrown in the bucket. They need to even the flavor distribution and then I would give them 5 stars!
3,Not as good as I thought they'd be,"Read so many reviews on how good these pops were, and that they are the best you'll ever have....well not really. The price I paid made this a good deal, but I found alot of the flavors had quite a sour taste, which dosen't appeal to me. I like that they're organic, but I'm just not jumping up and down over them. Just one mans opinion."
5,Awesome!,These lollipops are great - I put them out at my desk at work and people love the flavors and the fact that they are flavored naturally. great product!
4,Well-Received Lollipops!,These were extremely well-received by all of the college kids I shipped them to -- will become a staple of college care packages of the future!
5,Great organic lolly pops for the kids...,These are the only lollipops my wife will let the kids eat because they are organic and you can't get these in the supermarket. Good price and good quality product.
3,wont work with latest Canon 6D,Beautiful Compact top quality unit but not compatible with my new Canon Camera. Canons Tech department did everything but couldnt get this flash to communicate with my camera. Reluctantly to return unit for credit.
2,This is not the bag they are shipping out.,The bag that is pictured with the chain and traditional Everlast logo is not the bag that is sent out. The model #4008 is what is on the box(box is barely hanging on and is patched up with shipping tape all over to keep it together) but the bag inside has black webbing instead of chain and the new International Everlast logo. Other than that this is a great bag for the money it just is not the bag pictured and it is not the one ordered. So expect the unexpected. Good luck and keep your guard up.
1,Not for Boxing.,"If you are a cheapskate and are willing to endure joint pain then this is the one for you.Ladies, if your husband buys this for you, then he needs to dip into his beer money. Do not think this is a product designed for training. It is too hard and made from the cheapest materials money can buy. I am sorry Neverlast, but you have a terrible name in the Boxing community for quality and understanding what athletes need.Buy bags with foam liners, perferribly 2.5 to 3 inch thick liners.Sorry, but avoid this junk."
2,It's OK but....,when i took it out of the box i knew something wrong it was very uneven it was way too soft on the top and all the weight was at the bottom i had to re-stuff it.
2,Everlast 80lb Bag,"Don't really care for this bag, the top half is really soft, and the bottom half is really hard...the bottom half is a good texture for hitting I only wish the whole bag was the same texture."
1,Does Everlast Follow through?,"We have a long history of purchases from Everlast. We usually have no problems. With this bag purchase we expected no less. Within 3 months of purchase the bags seam began to separate. With a heavy bag, meant to take repetitive serious punches and kicks, this is unacceptable. I have tried numerous times to contact the company to resolve the issues and have recieved no response."
1,Bag seems too hard and hanging chain missing,We got this bag and it looked like it had some paint or something smeared on it and other dirty spots like it was not new. There was no chain hardware only the bag. My husband and son got frustrated with the bag as it felt too hard to punch without hurting yourself even wearing bag gloves. So bag it goes. Disapointed.
1,terrible,Don't waste your money on this! This bag gets pillow soft from the center up and rock hard from the center down after using it for less than a month. I'm throwing mine away and buying a UFC heavy bag based on reviews on their website.UPDATE 9/25/2011:I have owned the UFC heavy bag for a long while now and would highly recommend it over this one. It was well worth the extra cash.
1,Bag is not the same as in the picture,I ordered this 4008 80lb. Everlast bag that suppose to have chains on it instead of stitched nylon straps. What I ordered and wanted is what shows in the picture but that's not what I got. The traditional Everlast logo is different and I got nylon straps instead of chains from the bag to the chain hanger that is included. I am not very happy with this bag because it's not what shows in the picture. If you are concerned about the Everlast traditional logo and chains for the bag then don't order this bag because you won't get those two things. Other then that the bag is O.K. I can return it but what a hassle it would be to return an 80lb. bag. Amazon shouldn't deceive customers with inaccurate pictures of the product or at least inform the customer if the product has changed or just put the correct picture up.
2,Good but not great,"Great bag, got it middle of March. But last week one of the straps started to tear which hangs on the D rings. So now I need to find out how to hang it w/o it getting torn up. Emailed Everlast today & should be getting a new bag. Will update later on the outcome & best way to hang the bag so it lasts."
5,Got a Great Deal!,"I got this bag for my birthday just about a week ago and it was everything that I expected. I'm newly in on the working out scene with the heavy bags, and it is definitely good enough for at least beginners. 20 minutes a day and you'll start feeling like Mike Tyson... Well maybe you'll feel like it, but don't try to act like it. Don't need anybody trying to eat anyone elses ears. But anyways, I love my heavy bag, and I would recommend it to anybody!"
5,excellent for punching and kicking,i do tae kwon do and bought this as a practice bag. this bag is excellent and the attachments make installation to the ceiling a breeze. took about 5 minutes to set up with a power drill and it was ready to go. it also comes with a tie down to the floor to minimize movement.I used this bag at least 3-5 times a week and it takes a lot of punishment. for 6 months there has been no damage or movement in the stuffing of the bag or the surface. its a great buy and i would recommend this to anyone.
4,Hitting this is just too much fun!,I bought this heavy bag and gloves for the whole family (even the 4 year-old) and we have loved it.It is easy to get carried away with hitting it and you have to be very careful to maintain proper form (learn that first) so you can stay healthy and injury-free.This bag is great quality at a great price. It will take your abuse as long as you take care to protect yourself. It's far more likely to hurt you than you are it. Don't hit it without gloves because it's going to injure you if you do.Hitting this bag is a quick way to burn off a lot of stress and energy. It will surely outlast you in every workout no matter how much endurance you have.
5,Durable heavy bag for kicks and punches,"This is an 80 pound bag with a canvas like outer shell. It's pretty solid and the stitching on my particular bag is well done. The bag, at first, is nearly rock hard. However, after a few months of punching it, this does get broken in. Over time, the filler feels like there are some shifting and partial separation, internally. This leads to a weathered and more pleasant bag to hit over time,with or without Gloves.I hang mine on a combination heavy bag and speedbag stand. It's a great practice tool and an excellent method to take all frustrations out onto it. Don't worry, it'll take the punishment and then some. The outer shell is durable and doesn't rip from blunt force.This deserves a double thumbs up."
5,It's a heavy bag right?,"Just beat the ever-living snot out of the thing! When it's wore out... get another one and continue beating the snot out of it.Merry Christmas.Blessings,Eric"
4,Beautiful video of Cloudforests and Rainforests of Costa Rica,"This is a gorgeous video of the lush and tropical cloud forests and rainforests of Costa Rica in Central America. The audio also captures awide variety of beautiful wild animal voices throughout the program thatgreatly adds to the visual experience. The vistas vary from forestfloors and canopies to rushing waterfalls. The numerous jungle scenesare interspersed with many moving close-up images of butterflies,hummingbirds, frogs, flowers, parrots, lizards, monkeys and otherresidents of this great multi-species habitat. This would be a greataddition to any nature video library."
3,Nap Time,"The first hour was fine, but after that we kept seeing the same thing over and over again. I watched it once. Dave"
1,I got This Giant Box for Xmas and Now I Have to Return it?,"The faultlines of poorly manufactured overseas products and the Ancient Continent of Quality have rubbed together a lot in my life. They have let go and slipped with this product, so it gets about a 6.5 on my scale of disgust. The cabinet is p-board. The turntable, radio and tape work. So far the CD has never worked. If you lose the remote for this baby, nothing will work. And my Sis spent a lot of $$ for this product. But I'll have to take vacation and my money to repack the nonworker in its monster box, then go to Fedex or UPS and stand in line, and spend money to send it back and get another????. And all I see is a tsunami of more of this kind of stuff washing over me."
2,Not so great...,"The system, even though it looks great, has a very ""tinny"" sound. You can get better sound from an older Fisher Price child's system! There are no extra audio auxillary connections to connect it with a better sound system. My advice? Save your $$$ and invest in better equipment. I received this as a Xmas gift & after listening to it have not since turned it on. If you are looking for a ""nostalgic"" looking system check out the Crosley products. Same looks and better sound with the extra audio connection option on most. Thanks Santa, but you goofed. Glad I didn't spend my money on it. You would think RCA would have a better sounding product."
2,Meh...,"I'm not sure how many times I'm going to have to play a tutorial level, even after beating it, to get to the real game. Is there a real game??? Nothing like the old sonic..."
5,Great game!,My son loved itit is a great game!I loved the price and the experience with the sellerRecommended?Of course
4,Sonic and the Secret Rings,"I'm a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, and I spend a lot of time with kids who love Sonic. When we get together and play this game, it's always a lot of fun! The party mode is almost a game onto itself, and the story mode is entertaining as well, from the little I've played of it (1 1/2 chapters). A good game for around 15 dollars, especially if your kid likes Sonic."
3,sonic for wii,"This game has some very good graphics, but the game play isn't great. All that you really do is move side to side, and jump. There are even some level that you don't even have to move the wiimote or touch a button and the camera does all the work."
3,Mediocre sonic game.,"I dont own a wii or this game but I play it at my aunts house when I go, when i first played it was fun then I had to do the same level over,and over,and over,and over, and over again, that just got annoying,If I ever get a wii I wouldnt buy it, its way too repetitive if you play it everyone in awhile its fun but to own it and play the same level over and over, etc to unlock the next level it isnt funi know the mario games have that(super mario 64, sunshine,galaxy) but its different, ,ario games were somewha like that it works better with mario and its not as repetitive, so I wouldnt recoment buying the game maybe just maybe renting."
1,Sonic and the Secret Rings....,"...was so BORING!""Sonic Colors"" = 8.9""Sonic Generations"" = 8.7""Sonic Unleashed"" = 8.0The great category.""Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)"" = 0.1The terrible category.Sonic and the Secret Rings joins the 2006 waste of time being so boring and lame.My best friend played one round, then looked at me, we nodded our heads, and I went up immediately and changed the disc toSuper Smash Bros. Brawl, which is actually a game you should spend your money on.Buy Smash Bros or Sonic Colors and give this one a pass.For Moms doing Christmas shopping, for gamers, for Sonic fans, all a ya. Trust me, you'll do yourselves a favor."
5,It's Great!,"The game is full of great image effects and the sound quality is perfect. Besides, the game's design perfectly fits the new wii control features giving you the sensation of being in the middle of the action."
1,horrible,This is the worst piece of crap ever made. I can't believe it exist. Its not fun at all and makes me want to destroy things just thinking about how awful it is. Why would someone make a sonic game sans the fun? WHY?!?
1,This game sucked,"This game sucked. There where only a few boss battles, it was all about genies, and it ended without an ending."
1,Save Your Bills,"As an avid Wii user, let me say, this game isn't worth 50 bucks. SEGA failed as a game company for good reasons, as this game proves. They just don't know how to make a smooth, fun, nice game. Save your money for some great upcoming wii titles - super paper mario, metroid prime 3, super mario galaxy, smash bros, etc. There are going to be much better ways to spend 50 dollars in the next few months. Trust me."
3,SONIC RINGS,GOOD FOR THE YOUNGER GROUP BUT NOT FOR OLDER PEOPLE. ITS OK BUT I WAS BORED WITH THE GAME.
2,"Fun at first, but trust me, its frustrating controls get to you.","When you first buy this game, your most likely gonna say to yourself ""Wow, this game is great, why does everyone hate it so much?"" You'll say that now, but play it for a little while longer before you be quick on judgment. The Graphics are very good for a Wii title and it had a great idea, the problem is, the controls do not work with you when you need them to, at times they seem automatic, and most of the time to forceful, it gets anoying after awhile. The music, while can be good if you like heavy rock, just didn't suit this title. Another problem was the way the story/theme took on approach for a Sonic title. Sure its creative, but its pretty lackluster and doesn't fit for a game like this. Overall, this game is pretty terrible, I dont recommend buying it but maybe a 5 day rental wont kill you."
3,Not Bad,"Much better than any of the more recent 3D Sonic games, but no where near as much fun as his old-school 2D adventures. Definitely a step in a right direction for the franchise. Control takes some getting used to."
2,not like the old sonic.,"I suppose I was hoping for the old Sonic the hedgehog and so that led to my disappointment with this game. instead of being a game where you have the freedom to explore your surroundings there was a set path that had to be raced. i say raced because sonic is almost always moving, its like a racing game with out the cars. sonic is always going forward if you missed something you have to back him up. the adventure in it's self may be good for other people, I just did not find it worth my time. the party section of the game it nice, it has a racing cart game, along with games similar to the Wii sports. however for me if i wanted to play Wii sports, then i simply would, same with a racing game I'd just play mario cart.overall it's just not what i was looking for in a Sonic game."
2,Worst Game Ever,"Sonic games have been bad for a while. That said, the main problem they have had was always the controls so when I heard that there was a Sonic coming out for the Wii I was stoked. I thought that with the Wiimote they could easily capture the essence of what made Sonic fun on the Genesis. I was wrong. I played the game for multiple hours hoping that I would pick up the controls and the game would get better. It did not. I found myself screaming at the television, ""WHY CAN'T I BACK UP"" or ""TURN RED YOU FREAKING TARGET"". In the end I am really disappointed that I bought this TURD. Save your money."
3,First Motion Controlled Sonic Game,"Sonic and the Secret Rings is the first ""Sonic"" game for the Nintendo Wii. The player must steer Sonic thru seven different levels (plus one tutorial level). Each level has multiple challenges, ranging from easy to hard. The controls are intuitive and easy to learn for players 7 and up. Sonic and the Secret Rings also offer's several Multiplayer games, which consist of short Minigames comparing to those found in games like WarioWare. Overall, we are happy to see Sega's blue Hedgehog return to his roots of jump and run gameplay. The game does become more difficult as you progress and the motion sensing controls are not without flaws."
1,Boring game,"Compared to Lego games series, Sonic games are not fun.My son stopped playing with it after one session, but he'd play Lego over and over again.I feel the same way."
3,"Sonic, and the Secret Rings (Wii)","Okay, first of all, this game is really good, but I can't stand the gameplay. I honestly prefer open-world games instead, as this one won't let you go back. It is also somewhat difficult to pass levels, and figure out which ones you have and haven't already completed.~Shiruba Rose"
2,Someone needs to take a class in UI design 101,"Like the choice of many DS games to use the touchscreen unintuitively just because it is there, rather than using the D-pad where it makes a lot more sense to do so, this game is yet another example of why Nintendo's choice to provide motion controls on the Wii can be a source of great confusion and frustration. There is a whole section of missions teaching you how to use the controls, which would not be necessary if they had just made them intuitive. But even the explanations in the tutorial missions weren't clear enough. We still needed to look in the user manual to figure out some of them."
4,Sonic Party mode x3,"Overall it's a great game! The controls are easy to learn much like in SATBK (Sonic and the Black Knight).Party mode is great when you have friends or even if you want to play alone and chill, although you only have 4 characters to start out with and then you need to collect the Fire souls to get more..I would definitely recommend this for everyone of all ages!"
3,Bought for my son-age 6,"My son wanted this after playing it at his best friend's house. But after only a couple of plays he's back to his favorites (Super Mario Bros. Galaxy II, Donkey Kong Country Returns). Maybe it isn't as challenging as those? Or maybe it's more fun to play with other people's stuff? Obviously he likes the game though, so I recommend it."
2,The only way to Describe this game is Bad,"This game is of bad quality, not horrible, but bad. Bad enough to not be worth a rent too. It's no fun to play, the graphics are mediocre, the sound is almsot bad enough to mute, and it's not much worth replaying. This game is boring to play, all you do is run through boring stages, with boring objectives, fighting boring enemies.Presentation- 48/100Graphics- 57/100Sound- 42/100Terrible voice acting and poor quality music.Gameplay- 41/100Replay Value- 30/100Overall- 40/100"
5,Sonic and the return to greatness,"Sonic And The Secret Ringsis a great game and to ""Master Fatboy"" Sonic is nowhere near his demiese. Great gameplay, great control, great story, great (but sometimes cheesy) music and great graphics. this game will blow you away with it's greatness! Nuff said."
2,A Very Frustrating Game,This game had promise. I was dying for a new game on the Wii and what better game to choose than one starring Sega's long-time mascot? Boy was I wrong.This game is incredibly frustrating. The controls are very clunky. The camera angle changes without notice. I had to force myself to play it. There was no enjoyment in playing the game. The enjoyment came when I completed a few levels so I could stop playing.I wish I could add more to this review but all I can do is shake my head in disgust.
4,Sonic continues,"This game is great, but timing is everyting. I've always loved sonic and I still do. The only problem is control. When sonic glydes after a jump and plans for a homeing attack you can't really control when you want to attack the target. If the target is blowing fire you really have to time your jump perfectly and flawlessly.I also wish there was someone to see what's about to occur, like if a pillar is going to fall you won't know. You just have to avoid it by jumping or stopping and speeding up again. You can't tell when something is about to intterrupt your progress.No guide needed all you need to do is find out how to use the rings and you'll be ok. I am."
1,Nothing like the old Sonic the Hedgehog game!,"If you are expecting anything like the old Sonic the Hedgehog that was played on a Sega Genesis, look elsewhere. I am new to Wii, and was looking for some familiar games from the past, and chose this one. I had figured that it would be at least somewhat like the old Sonic game, but unfortunately it is nothing like it! It is hard to play, and doesn't seem to have much going on other than running in a straight line collecting rings."
4,at first i wasnt very impressed....,"but after i got thru the first level, which i will say is 30 second rounds that are not very fun, i realized that they are just setting you up for the next worlds. that way you will know how to stop & do high jumps, etc. i am now in love with this game. ESPECIALLY the party games. which i also was not impressed with at first. but once i got my bf to play with me we played for NO LIE...8 hours yesterday. the games are short enough that you dont get bored & they are hilarious. 90% of the challenges we were cracking up at. & they have 5 different scenes/places you can play them. its a really great game. if i had 3 thumbs, id give it 3 thumbs up! =)"
2,"I don't know what it is about it, but this game's just not much fun","At times it just too difficult for me. But I am not a very big gamer. I just bought a wii 6 months ago and it came with mariokart; I played it everyday and made it through all the levels in 3 or 4 months. I intensely enjoyed it. But Sonic and the Secret Rings just doesn't seem to engage me very much. It's difficult to use the controller to make Sonic do what you're wanting him to do eg. moving backwards, doing a jump dash, stopping and going back, pretty much everything is difficult to do in regards to controlling his direction. And there's even one level so far where you can't even see where you're going because the screen faces backwards. I'm most likely not going to bother finishing this game, because you have to practice and play each level over and over to progress to next set of levels. It's more like work than a game. But mind you I'm not an advanced or moderate gamer."
2,"Bad Controls make this game ok,",I saw this game in a store for [...]$ dollars!No wonder! This game is not very good.Pros-#Amazing graphics!#Detail is very good!#Many playable characters in multiplayer.#Cool StoryCons-#Some levels are diffucult#The controls are absolutely horrible!#You cant move where you want to during levels. You have to go on a required path.I give it a 2.5
2,Not the Sonic you love,"The game is really like balancing on a roller coaster. You don't really control where the character goes, just what he touches along the way. Sonic has to touch rings, not touch vases, jump over fire but you have very little control other than speed and angle. Sonic follows a predefined track so if you don't even touch the controller, he seems to do okay during certain parts. Your job is to move the controller in awkward ways to get Sonic to do the convoluted moves necessary to not hit things or jump, attack etc. I also found the Sonic character story at the beginning (which you can't seem to skip) to be torture to sit through. Sonic's ego in the story is huge and not endearing to the character. I'd stick with the more traditional Sonic games and stay away from this one."
4,Fun but has a few issues,"This game is fun overall. The storyline is kinda lame but it opens up the Sonic universe to more then fuzzy animal saving so I cant complain. The feel of the game is great, I really enjoy it most of the time. My issues stem from game controls. Most of the time game control is fine, but issues do arise in some levels that cause me to die in the same place over and over again. The upside is it usually hones my ability in the skill to mastry so any time I use it after it's easy. But the downside is I spend 25 minutes dieing at the same part where usually the restart point is far away. If you get annoyed quickly and are prone to throwing the controller at your TV I would not recommend this game. If your in it for the challenge of getting everything JUST right, you should love it. All in all it will either improve my patience or destroy my TV."
1,Don't Risk Damaging Your Paper Shredder,"Shred a $50 bill instead of this game, your paper shredder will thank you."
1,"coming from someone who plays video games, ALOT...","All the 3d Sonics have been hideous. This game is no exception to that trend. Sonic the Hedgehog should have died with the Sega hardware. Instead greedy money hungry individuals drag what was once a great franchise through the mud, in an attempt to turn prophet off horrendously made sequels and spin offs."
3,Part of the story,"This book is a good place to start if you're thinking of moving to a town of 15,000 or less. It will point you to many interesting communities. However, having used his previous book to guide my last move, and as a resident of one of the towns highlighted in this book (Grinnell), I can honestly say that data only carries you so far. Crampton could provide readers with a great benefit by lengthening the amount of description and flavor for each town. In particular, one key element missing is the 'dynamic' of a town: is it progressive? conservative? excited about education? quick to vote down taxes and bonds? These elements form the 'culture' of a small town, and believe me, the culture of a small town will be *very* important to you!"
5,Fan Power Adapter Cable,I used 4 of these to connect some 120MM fans to an audio rack cooling system at my house. These little adapter cables did the job nicely and connected to ones I already had. TIP>>> If you buy the Coolerguys Cabcool802 Dual 80mm Fan Cooling system for a project you can use the AC plugin adapter they have to run several other fans at the same time.
5,Great Event!,"UFC 139 has got to be one of the best events i have ever had the pleasure of watching, and i have been watching the sport for quite some time. A must have for hardcore fans or new fans of the fight game!The one negative thing i noticed about the event were the fans in San Jose. I thought the fans would be a bit more appreciative of some of the action seeing as how it is the hometown of Strikeforce. At times the fans came off as completely unknowledgeable and ignorant. The boo's that could be heard in some of the earlier fights drove me crazy!!Outside of that little complaint i thought the card was excellent, 5 stars!!"
1,Not as it says,"The description seem to imply that it fits all TV's up to40"" screen size. It turns out that it was not compatible withmy Sony TV. Had to return it."
1,Rough edges - not properly polished - can't use,"This slide has sharp edges, it's not well polished, and can hurt your hand. I returned the first one. The second one had the same rough edges against your fingers, and it had a ding on the playing surface which rendered it useless. I'm returning it and cancelling the sale. Need to try somewhere else."
2,I'm disapointed.,"I'm a longtime dobro and lapsteeler and I use Stevens slides. Most of mine are scratched up, so I decided to buy a new one. This one doesn't have 'Stevens' or anything on it on either side. Its my perception it is an off brand being sold as Stevens. All my other Stevens bars came in a plastic tube with a red cap, but this one came in plastic wrap. Other than that, it looks the same and seems to play the same, but time will tell if its really a 'Stevens'. No, I did not try to contact seller or return it. Considering the price I payed, I'll just keep it and see how it does. Just be aware."
5,Golden Gate F-3304 Stevens Steel Slide,"This is a pretty standard product when it comes to slides. There are only, really, about 3 or 4 models of slides for dobros. This one has a good fit and feels quite comfortable in my hand whether playing chords or notes or moving around the fretboard."
4,Thorough,"Goes through much of spine biomechanics, similar to White & Panjabi text but also covers design principles for instrumentation."
2,Looses time regularly,"Watch has to be reset at least once a week....looses time. I bought it for work, but it defeats the purpose if it causes me to be late."
3,sounds too wagnerian,"This has a great technical sound and has a lot of rich detail embroidered in it from the beginning, but it sounds way too Wagnerian for my tastes. Schulhoff is far from being Wagnerian and is in fact too eclectic, oriental, and jazzy for Albrect, who has a tendency to tinker with the orchestration, to fully realize as a compositional piece. Also, the tempo for this Albrect set is much faster and thus diminishes the exotic and atmospheric nature of Schulhoff's symphonies. I prefer the Valek recordings which admirably preserve the uniquely mysterious style of Schulhoff."
2,"Interesting songs, bad sound","Sure, it's 4 years ago already, but I just found this in my stack of seldom-listened to CD's and checked it out again.... This is one of those albums where you, the listener have to struggle to make the songs transcend their recorded ""sound"". Ridiculously awash in reverb, this album seems to have been produced and mixed with a very superficial understanding of the sound-style of the classic music from where it draws inspiration. Perhaps I'm being too harsh... On a positive note, Alex Oropeza's guitar work is outstanding, and many of the songs leave a lingering impression, which I re-mix in my memory to make sound better."
2,This Book is messed up,"This book is messed up. Like any other Give Yourself Goosebumps book it has two main choices that you can choose from that go it to a bunch of smaller choices. This is an example of why it is messed up. One of the main cohices says to go to pp. 34, but the other one says to go to 21. If you choose to go to page 21 you read the page and then it says to go to page 34!These are not the actual page numbers,i don't remember because i read this book a year ago."
3,Good but could have had more exercises,"I agree with most reviewers here who note that Teach Yourself Croatian is full of useful information and interesting dialogues.The recordings are also clear and give you exposure to hearing native speech (unlike a few courses which use advanced speakers who nonetheless speak with a slight but detectable non-native accent)The biggest failing of this course is that it doesn't have enough exercises for practice. There are usually between 4 and 7 sets of exercises for each chapter (15 chapters in total). Each set has between 3 and 5 questions. In my experience that is insufficient if you're learning the language for the first time. You should consider using another course (e.g. Ronelle Alexander's and Ellen Elias-Bursac's new course ""Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian"") in order to provide yourself with extra practice/reinforcement with the language."
4,Teach yourself helps!,"So far it's working. The cd's help out alot, because you can go back over and over again. The book is writen so everyone can understand. I would recommend."
4,A707,"I have had this phone for a little over a year and it is a alright phone, I did find though if you use a bluetooth headset, the ringer takes a few rings before it will come up to par on sound, and I did fine also my Mom has a razor and the motorola would pick up in areas a single ahere i would lose on this phone."
2,Too many repairs,"My family has four of these phones on a two year plan, purchased new. In less than one year, three of the four phones needed repair, one of them twice. Only two of these repairs were covered by warranty. This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible. We are not that hard on our phones. Also, we need to replace two batteries already because they will not keep a charge for more than a few text messages. This phone is expensive to maintain."
3,OK,Well its an awasome phone but the memory fills up REALLY fast and i personally dont like that there is only 2 sounds to alert you that you have a txt msg!! (vibrate and some sort of ding sound!! p.s.annoying) There should be songs! Its also GIANT.
1,This phone sucks!,"I have owned this phone for a little over a year and it sucks! I have had nothing but problems with it and now it's out of warranty so it's a paperweight until I can upgrade at an affordable price. Unless you're looking for a pretty paperweight, NO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!!!"
4,"good, solid","This was good practice, but a true pro can slip out with just the right touch;p. Those who know how, know.Otherwise, if you need these professionally, make sure to check the perps' lower body leverage, too, as I have had little trouble snapping this weightof chain with an assist from one (1!) leg, and I'm not as spry as I usedta coulda..."
3,"If you want heavy cuffs, drop the money on Smith and Wessons.","If you want real heavy hand cuffs, why bother with anything less then the real mcoy?Smith and Wesson police issue handcuffs are what the real police use on real criminals, they double lock, they are heavy, sturdy, and beautiful.If you want cuffs to play with, get whatever you want. But if you want the real thing, don't kid yourself, drop the cash on the Smith and Wessons."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED.,"These are garbage. They are dollar tree quality at best, fake ""double lock"" that is a flip up tab like plastic toys. Anyone looking for real cuffs stick to peerless or s&w. These are not even safe to use as fetish cuffs, they dont always unlock and the locking mechanism is horrible, you will end up in the emergency room explaining how your wrist's got cut. Products like these are gag gifts, not "" Professional use"". Fast shipping on a garbage product. Very disappointing that i purchased two pairs. I wont even give these to my kids to play cops and robbers with because they are so unsafe."
5,Fifty Shades of Kinky,"I purchased these after reading the first fifty shades book. I cannot tell you how excited I was to get these in my mailbox. Upon opening, the product was in very good condition. The black finish is very hott. They are however a little heavy but very sturdy! By look and feel of them I dont think they will break easily. Great product at a good price. I was to scared to spend less on a pair bc I didn't wanna end up with a plastic toy so I'm pretty happy I got these for a decent price and didn't have to as far as spending up to thirty dollars for a real pair of cop cuffs!"
5,Great Handcuffs,"I was very skeptical about purchasing handcuffs period I figured since the fake ""toy"" handcuffs were a few $ cheaper, why not try the real thing! These handcuffs are absolutely amazing! Yes, they are real! I tried them on and could not get out of them. I literally had to wait for my husband to come home and take them off. They are steel and heavy duty. I have never used handcuffs before but I know these will last a great while!:o)"
2,alright,"These handcuffs are okay for home use, but if you intend to use them for your profession, go ahead and pop the money on the smith and wesson's. A guy who knows what he's doing or is decently strong could pull the chain apart if he wanted to."
2,Ok set of cuff's,"I got these as part of a package deal, I was going to get a set of peerless but the package price swayed me torwards these... They are an OK set of cuffs.. the action is ok, but the deadlocks stick and you have to beat the deadlocks for them to disengage.. I am not crazy about the finish either, it is kind of rough and not very polished. I will eventually get a set of peerless like I use at work, but for now these are ok.."
4,Kinky,"They are very heavy weight, strong and fun. Just don't misplace the key. Enjoy the fun times. Inspired by Fifty Shades of Gray"
3,Key is a little bigger than most other models.,"I use other pairs of handcuffs all the time, and all handcuffs share the same locking mechanism except this one. For some reason the key is slightly larger than with other models, and so it requires a different key. Carrying two keys is inconvenient."
4,Not as sturdy but serves great,"I am a cop in the military and ordered these as a back up pair for the weekends tend to be a little crazy. These handcuffs are not as sturdy as US military standard issue handcuffs. However they serve the same purpose and work just as well. Usuing these handcuffs the double lock has stayed locked, and everything is working properly. These keys never fail, on either set. The only problem i found is they need a little more room than the standard index finger wrist room on the suspects. These tend to dig into the skin more than the issued handcuffs. Overall a good product for professional use."
4,WHO NEEDS HEDWIG WHEN YOU HAVE JAYNE COUNTY,"THIS ALBUM IS THE TRUE GLAM ROCK ALBUM YOU SHOULD OWN.BEFORE THE SEX CHANGE OPERATION JAYNE(FORMERLY WAYNE)WAS ALREADY WRITING, PERFORMING CUTTING EDGE MUSIC.A GREAT EXAMPLE OF PUNK MEETS GLAM ROCK.WHO NEEDS HEDWIG WHEN YOU HAVE JAYNE COUNTY."
2,Several defects,"1. Once I declined to upgrade to ""Premium"", it conveniently chose to ignore my ESPP or ESOP transactions. I had to search the appropriate topics and enter the information.2. I had ESOP transactions with the purchase price less than 50 cents and the program rounded it to ZERO, thereby increasing my gains and taxes.3. And obviously, the efiling fees is exorbitant... given that the IRS doesn't charge a penny.I am definitely switching to TaxCut next year"
2,Why wait until March to discount?,"I'm going with Taxcut this year because TurboTax just waits too long before getting competitive price-wise. When I looked for this product in January, it was the full $45. Taxcut was a more-reasonable $30."
4,Turbo Tax,"Turbo Tax is easy to use, and has similar features year after year. There are additional fees for filing the state tax online and additional fees for filing the federal tax online. The fees are not disclosed upfront, so I printed out the completed forms and mailed it in for over 25 times fewer fees. I would recommend this product to complete your taxes if you need to file the long form."
4,Venerable and reliable TurboTax,I gave up using a CPA to do my taxes a few years ago and see no reason anyone would need one except in instances where there are truly some unusual tax related issues that go beyond the norm. I recommend that one only submit their TurboTax return forms no earlier than late February to ensure the latest software updates are provided to ensure an accurate return. Taking advantage of E-Filing will typically provide a refund within one to two weeks.
2,Redesigned Interface Again,"They redesigned the user interface again. Anyone who has used TurboTax in the past and is familiar with the program will need to learn a new interface. I was willing to pay the premium price for TurboTax because of my familiarity with the software and wanting to avoid learning a new program. If I had known they changed the user interface so much, I would have saved some money and purchased TaxCut."
1,bad software,Every time I try this 2006 TurboTax software I get a new result for my tax return.I tried 5 times on this version using the same inputs + dozens other tests. Other people told me that they had the same problem all the times.I don't know if the MAKER of this knows about this. I gave this software 3 stars because I used TurboTax in 2004 & 2005 with the similar problem. I filed them anyway ... But not this year ... because I don't want to pay more taxes and still get some money back on the same tax returns (according to this 2006 software)
5,TurboTax 2005,I have used TurboTax since I retired over 10 years ago. Before that I had always used a tax accountant to do my taxes. After using TurboTax for 4 or 5 years my doubting wife felt we should have the tax accountant review our tax return done using TurboTax. He found no errors and had no additional suggestions. For years I have been a Beta tester and each year there are improvements to the previous year's program that I had thought couldn't be improved upon. One year I used a less expensive tax program and quickly found that to be a big mistake. I highly recommend TurboTax.
3,Whats with all the Beta Testers?,Most of these reviews are from people who got the product for free. Very few of them have ever written another review. Sounds like Intuit is stacking the deck.
3,Hidden costs,"While I've used TurboTax Online in prior years ,it's gotten expensive.This year's Fed & State would have cost a total of $56.So I decided to try the CD Version.It cost $44 and I thought all was included for the price.The software is complete and checks your return carefully.It's at the end where you've got to shell out another $30 to E-file both returns that burned me.Safe to say the online Version is for me from now on. When filing with the Online ver. it tells you up front how much it'll cost totally.Let the buyer beware!"
3,TurboTax Twists,"I've been using TurboTax (or its predecessor programs) for at least a decade. Although I'm generally satisfied with it, I don't like the difficulty in moving from certain feature windows back to my return. And I don't like the need for more than the minimum number of mouse clicks to move from one interview item to the next."
1,Crashing always,"I have installed this product on my IBM ThinkPad notebook, and its operating system is Windows XP. Because I have used TurboTax last year, I have imported 2005 tax return file, and then started to enter 2006 data. A few steps of navigation always resulted in crash. It was not random. Same sequences of navigation always resulted in a popup window saying ""TurboTax Engine has encountered a problem and needs to close..."", and then it crashed with no chance of saving entered data. Reinstallation didn't help. I will return this one."
1,Totally Frustrating,This was THE WORST edition of Turbo-Tax I have used. For me it was NOT user-friendly in many areas. Several entries I made were shown on the worksheet but not carried over to the form. I will NOT be using Turbo-Tax again.
3,Overpriced,"Spend $40 on state and federal, then its an ADDITIONAL $16 to efile just federal! So $56 for pretty much a basic federal and state tax program. TaxAct is $20 for the same thing, but it doesn't offer a Mac version. Online preparation is even cheaper, but checkout privacy policies. TaxCut is downright bad. I've had TaxCut tell me completely wrong things that would have cost me thousands. I ran out and bought TurboTax to double check. Turbotax is good, easy to use, and illustrated the mistake the TaxCut made. But Turbotax is overpriced, TaxAct seems almost as good."
4,"It worked ok, but had some trouble","I used TaxCut Pro last year, and I liked it better. The TurboTax worked, but it got confusing when trying to do the state taxes... I had to reinstall the state, and then it started a new return and didn't import my federal info, and it took me a while to figure that out. Once I did, I was generally pleased with it."
2,'Newest' version was incomplete,I will go back to manually doing my taxes as this product needed updates which I had to attempt to obtain and TurboTax was not very timely. It has been two weeks and I am still awaiting the newest version. Could have completed my return and mailed it by now. I am very dissappointed with their customer service.
2,An Excellent Product,"I have used TurboTax for the past 16 years. It is and always will be the only product I use or recommend. This is the easiest and best tax software available. It gives the opportunity to answer questions through an interview about your family, income, real estate and everything you need. If, like me, you know what you need to enter, you can skip the interview and just data enter info. You get automatic internet updates from Intuit by answering that you want to from the install section of the program. Intuit stands behins the product and the refund/liability owed to IRS. No other programs is this easy. It could put tax professionals out of business. I have been lucky enough to help Beta test the 2009 product for Intuit. I can guarantee you will love it!!!! I cannot figure out how to give it 10 stars plus, but I do."
4,BEWARE OF USED SOFTWARE,"I WAS SOLD USED SOFTWARE THAT WILL NOT ADD UPDATES, COMPUTE STATE RETURNS, OR ALLOW PRINTING."
3,Not worth the extra dough!,"TT is good and cleaner but not noticeably better enough to justify the much higher price than taxcut. I purchased TT for the first time this year because I wanted to do my taxes on my Mac. I had used taxcut on my mac in the past with good results but taxcut had abandoned the Mac platform and forced me to use my PC. Fortunately I was able to port my info between taxcut Mac and Taxcut PC. I was unable to port my last years taxcut PC to my Turbotax Mac version this year. Overall TurboTax was smooth and direct. I normally go with the adage that 'you get what you pay for' and don't mind paying more for quality. In this case I did not see the justification. Also, if you're not in a rush for your return, I would recommend printing out your taxes from either package and mailing them in. The e-file costs have gone up way too high this year. Buy the 40 cent stamp and save."
1,Would have been nice to know its not 98 compatible!!,I have used Turbo Tax for the past 3 years so this year like a drone I purchased it at Amazon. Great price by the way. Well I receive the product and try to load it and find out as of July '06 it isn't compatible with windows '98. Now I have to send it to Turbo Tax for a refund. Its great that they are doing that but they should have put something on the front of the box. After a 45 minute call to Turbo Tax they finally agreed to credit me the difference of $20 for the purchase of their online software. The online software was the same exact program I purchased from Amazon but they charge $20 more...go figure. It sounds fishy and deceitful to me. I will never buy their software again!!
4,checks in the mail,product works great the only thing that I thought was B.S. was that to have your returns sent in via internet you have to pay an additional $32.00 and the turbotax company doesnt do anything additional except collect the money. in other words the ability to send it via the internet is already on the disk that you have already purchased.
3,Still turbotax...,"Okay, if you've used turbotax before, you've used this year's version. It's pretty much the same. The new additions this year:1) The 'register now' nag screen that pops up every time you run it until you register2) The advertising. Everywhere. Over and over. I'm not trying to shop, I'm trying to do my taxes!3) The user interface is a bit more clunky this year than previous years.4) There's no free e-file included this year. That adds $30 to the price of the productIt'll still do your taxes, though, in a reasonable way."
1,ItsDEDUCTIBLE IS NOT INCLUDED ON CD AS ADVERTISED,"I ORDERED TURBOTAX FOR THE ""ItsDEDUCTIBLE"" PROGRAM, WHICH THE PACKAGE STATES IS ""INCLUDED.""IT WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE DISK, BUT RATHER I HAVE TO GO ON-LINE, REGISTER AND INCLUDE MY NAME, TAX STATUS, AND INCOME ON THE WEB. WHERE THIS INFORMATION GOES, OR HOW IT IS SECURED IS UNKNOWN TO ME. WHEN I TRIED TO REGISTER IT WOULD NOT TAKE THE INCOME INFORMATION AND KEPT KICKING ME BACK TO REGISTRATION. WHEN I TRIED TO CALL TO GET HELP ALL I WAS TOLD WAS THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING EXTREMELY LONG WAIT TIMES.I'M RETURNING THE PRODUCT TO AMAZON..."
3,only allows one state,The software only allows you to install the software for one state without paying a lot extra. It is unfair to those who have income in more than one state and have to file in two states. I think it is petty of Turbotax.
2,Option transactions,"Turbo Tax is less than impressive in handling stock and option transactions. It seems to view short sales as errors, reporting that the date acquired is later than the date sold. It does not appear to have a provision for tagging a short sale. It does not appear to have a provision for properly dealing with dividends on stock held for more than 12 months, but covered by disqualifying call options. Its screens for schedule D and D1 are awkward - it would be much better to have one large table screen for all transactions, with tags to set short term and long term tax application, from which D and D1 could be formatted for filing."
2,There Is Probably Better,"I purchased Turbotax with the intent of doing my own return this year in lieu of again using a CPA which is quite expensive. I had to immediately upgrade my basic Turbotax product in order to enter pertinent data on the supporting federal tax forms. I am a stock, options, and futures trader.I could never figure out how to enter summary data from the Composite Substitute 1099 Statement Summary provided me by brokerage firms. When asked how to do this, the Turbotax e-mail reply had absolutely nothing to do with the question I had subnitted.Telephone contact with Turbotax is either extremely limited or non-existant."
1,Turbo tax is incomplete at time of purchase!,"The past two years I have used Turbo Tax and both years I had to wait for several weeks after I completed my taxes to file because of Turbo Tax not being complete until mid February. Turbo Tax keeps updating there product months after its release, which means that depending on the forms being used, you may not be able to paper or e-file until there updates are complete. Plus they charge you $14.95 for federal and again for state to electronic file. This puts the total price for Turbo Tax at about $40(software)+$30(e-file) = $70.00. This is about the same price as a professional CPA would charge, without the protection or advice! NEVER AGAIN TURBO TAX!"
1,No investments,"Last year (for 2005) I purchased the Turbo Tax Deluxe and all things considered, was quite pleased with it. HOWEVER, I looked at the 2006 Turbo Tax Deluxe Deduction Maximizer and notice that NO security sales will be allowed (as was allowed previously in Deluxe). If that is not true, then the write-up by Intuit (compare page) is misleading when they say if you want to use TT Deluxe you must have no security sales. Confusing."
5,Turbo Tax makes life easy....unlike taxes!,I have used Turbo Tax for as long as it's been on the market and have never been dissapointed. Very user friendly and helpful. A trustworthy product worth the price.
1,not happy this year,"After many years (10?) of happily using Turbo Tax, this is the first year I have had problems. Since I use dial up I have not been able to get the updates without calling to have the update CD mailed (twice, waiting up to a MONTH each time). This is delaying my refund filing 2 months. Not only that, but Intuit has been gradually increasing the price while locking us in with the convenience of transfering last year's information. Even after getting the update disk, my NYS return would not print so I had to do manually!! I will not EFILE for $16 each and paper filed for the first time in ages. Going back to ALL paper next year."
4,TurboTax Deluxe 2006,This year's program appears to be as good or better than prior year programs. Although I have not yet filed my returns the program seems to be easier to use than prior year programs.
2,A New Major Bug Every Year,"This is a complex piece of software that handles a large percentage of the tax return in a user friendly manner, but every year I discover a major ""bug"" that no one at Turbo Tax can fix. I have been deducting housing depreciation since 1990 using Turbo Tax; this year for the first time it does not carryover my home office deductions from my 2005 Form 8829. I called TurboTax & talked with Jarrod & then Jose Ortiz today. They could not determine why it didn't carryover. Yes, I did get to the part of the interview where it asked for my home office. No, I have not used up my 31.5 years of depreciation since I began in 1990.I haven't switched to another package because reviewers say that Turbo Tzx is best for complicated tax situations.This is definitely not a package for inexperienced computer users or people who have disorganized records. I do not fall into either of those catagories & I have a lot of difficulty with it.Frederica Shockleyshockley@rocko.csuchico.edu"
3,"No, the other one!",It does most of what it says it will do -- and then some. But it is very confusing in the area of independence and 1099s and all that and does not easily allow changes (at least not for me)eg.I could not get it to recognize that my spouse had a consulting business as well as I. It looks like I'll have to settle for having 2 this year or maybe I'll redo that section by hand and use the rest. It is really good at streering you to more consultants who will charge more money. Too bad technical help is unreachable. Neverthe less it does a competent job for less than you'd hire a human being to yell at.
2,Deluxe edition is not sufficient for small investors any more!,"I was disappointed that the investment function was moved to the Premier edition, which costs $25 more. All right, this year I will need to do paper filing and manual calculation for 1040 Schedule D."
2,errors difficult to fix,"I used the TurboTax software for my federal and state returns for 2005 and encountered a serious problem - the state return did not remove my social security earnings which are not taxable in Indiana. I had a difficult time getting the problem corrected but, more importantly, are there other program errors which can only be found if the return is thoroughly examined. I also found using ""It's Deductible"" to be very annoying and time consuming because it used the exact same categories that were used the previous year and all names must remain the same. You find this out after you have entered all of your deductions and then you have to go back and change things - ex: you can't use ""ABC University"" one year and ""ABC Foundation"" the next. It shouldn't even use last year's categories. It is too expensive to not be able to trust it. I'll be trying TaxCut this year - along with the included e-filing."
4,DELIBERATE HARDSHIP?,"I've used TURBOTAX for several years and am very well satisfied with the results altho this years version is a bit more cumbersome to use for my situation. The bad part of it is that the state tax is not included on the cd. I don't know if it was made deliberately difficult to order a state cd or just plain poor design, but if you do want a state cd (which you have paid for), I wish you ""good hunting""."
2,Where is my State,"I could not download the state or get any updates until I called the tech support line. After about 40 minutes and turning off my popup blockers, spyware programs, virus program and firewall, I was able to finally get my state and all the updates. To me this seemed a little to much to do to just update a tax program. I've been using TurboTax for years and this was the hardest one to updates and by the way it had no rebates of any kind."
3,Each year it's a new headache,"First let me state I've been using TurboTax for 10 years. At first it was a great product, but each year it seems to become worse and worse. This year the import won't work. A few years ago it was spyware, funky registration codes, the list goes on and on for many.So why not switch to a competitor? Simply because the competitors are not as good at finding deductions. It's a catch-22, easy of use vs. greater savings."
4,TurboTax Mac,"I have been using TurboTax for Mac for several years with no problems or issues, and it just keeps getting better.TurboTax handles all the basic tax reporting needs of my family, and the Deluxe version automatically downloads tax forms for one state of my choice, and transfers Federal information to complete the State forms.My only complaint is that due to many last-minute changes in tax laws, a lot of time is required to download and update the program."
2,Kind of a waste of money.,"I found that you can do the same thing online through TurboTax as you can with the software...and with the software, you still have to pay to file the paperwork online. They led me to believe that it was free filing."
4,turbo tax,have used h&r block the past several years. Didn't find this any better for the higher price. Also found turbo tax @ sam's for a cheaper price than amazon. Doing your own taxes is definitely the way to go. Try both applications just to see which is best for you. Also you can download a version of either of these for about half the cost of buying the cd. Advantantage of the cd is you can do up to 5 peoples tax returns from 1 cd. Only 1 if you download it. FYI
3,"Good, but -",I'm a first time user and was frustrated at all the W-2 info you had to enter that is not needed if you are mailing your return. Some of us are not ready for all info going to cyberspace. Also when you leave the program and return there is no ready way to get to where you stopped and you have to jump through several hoops. Just another factor of annoyance during tax time. Since I don't use itemized deductions I'm not sure that it is worth the cost/time to use it. I got the Fed/State for $40 and was not tickled that all I wound up with was a nicely printed form.
3,"Excellent for ""prepare""..not so good for ""filing""","The software only prepare the tax and not including the filing, not even the free federal e-filing from tons other sites. Software price is higher than last year. All tax prep softwares decided to stop offering rebates this year (to ease our pain to submit the rebate, they said) but didn't lower the price of the software (Yep, so they make more profit). Looking for online filing site next year!"
4,Am I the only one that feels like this has gotten harder to use over time?,"I've been using Turbotax for several years now and I feel like with the 2006 version they've made it so ""stupid proof"" that I worry I'm not doing things correctly. Older versions gave you a better feel for what was going on with the calculations and also how you might better construct your deductions for next year (because you could see how things were calculated).That bein said Intuit has great and friendly support, and I still will continue to use it. Good support boosts them to 4 stars otherwise I would only go with 3."
4,A good value and surprisingly accurate.,"I bought this to help my Wife, since she files taxes for her mother. We usually have an accountant handle our taxes, but this year was a nice surprise: TurboTax and the accountant were a match. I feel confident doing our own taxes next year if needed.The step-by-step workflow makes it very easy to complete your taxes, assuming you've collected all of your paperwork and you have a mug of coffee ready. The software does keep you apprised of progress and it's very useful having a tool manage what needs to be considered. The outputs can be vendor-neutral, so your work doesn't have to remain tied to the product.I don't see a problem with this software at all. I withheld a star because the updating program needed a little help getting through the process.-Fred"
1,"Too expensive, there are alternatives.","I used TurboTax online the last two years and was a satisfied customer. I wanted to return to TurboTax online this year, but realized that it would cost $60 ($30 federal + $30 state), then I looked at this product here. I almost bought it, but thank God to other reviewers which pointed out that it cost $70 with this product to file your taxes ($40 + $30 for e-Filing) for both state and federal. Thank to another reviewer which recommended TaxAct I switched this year. I haven't finished it there but $15 for everything (state + federal + e-filing for both) is pretty good. It is just as good as TurboTax. Give the third contenter for tax preparation a chance, you won't regret it."
5,Great Software,This product preformed as described. It was very easy and simple to install and assisted you with walking thru the process of entering the information to complete tax forms.
5,Makes 1040 Almost Sporty!,"Been using TurboTax for about five years now, except for one year when I used TaxCut. TurboTax is by far the better of the two. Walks me right through 1040, plus my wife's self-employed business filing swamp. Good deal all the way!"
4,Good at asking questions,"I have tried this program in past years and found that it covers just about anything you could possible imagine. Sometimes it seems to be to thorough in its examination. The question segments that are presented for deduction and income I think could be streamlined a bit so you don't have to click through so many non-pertinent subjects. If you need suggestions, give me a call. I run it on a Mac and am glad that they support Mac as well as they do."
4,Turbo Tax Federal + State Deluxe,Very easy to use and follow. It allows you to either follow a series of questions or do it yourself by selecting the topics that are applicable to you in preparing your tax return. It allows those who are more proficient in preparing tax returns to skip over areas that are not applicable...(i.e. saves time).
2,Back order,The State and Federal updates were not availble from intuit. They have been backordered. I am not pleased because I have a large federal refund and I am ready to file the return.
4,Filing your Federal & State Income Tax with Turbo Tax,The product does a good job filling out the tax forms and calculating the tax owed. You need to be sure you provide the information correctly for each category. If the information is not in the right place of the form it can cause a problem with the correct tax owed which can result in too large or too small a refund. In the past you would get a rebate on the federal electronic filing. This year that was not offered and it cost about $30 to file both federal & state taxes. That is the main complaint that I have. The other is that they elude to the idea that the state filing part of the software is free for one state. That is not true. You can buy the program for less money if you get the version that does not include the state tax portion.
2,Updating lost my return!,"I spent hours working on my return. I had it complete except for a form that was not available. When Turbo Tax emailed to come back to my return and they would finish it with the unavailable form, my whole return was lost. I did nothing, except go back to the program. As I opened the program it automatically began to update, no way to stop this process. It updated 10 forms. I had updated the program 3 days before when I began my return. Now I have to start all over again and spend hours working on my return again. Bad flaw in the program. I cannot get to Turbo Tax to tell them about this flaw, I keep running into walls. I also saved everything I did as I went along."
1,Nothing but problems,"I've used Turbo Tax for the last 5 years but this year it was a disaster. It keep putting my school credit into the GDP on the first page of the 1040. Turbo Tax Support finally said they have no idea how to fix it. It made my taxes wrong, wrong forms printed, so I finally did it myself. It really wasn't a hard return but some gliche in the program caused me nothing but headaches. Over 3 hours to support, reloading the program twice, and redoing it 3 times. I've requested a refund from Turbo Tax."
4,Top Notch Tax Program,"I have been using TurboTax for years and every year it keeps getting better and better. They also improve it to make it easier to use and understand. As an accountant myself, I use this for my home business to do everyones taxes. The only thing I see is that sometimes you will not get all the credits you are entitled to, unless you know what to look for."
1,Beware of State Calculations,"I have Fed Tax-free interest which is so declared on Form 1040. After the interview, this line item was transferred to my Ohio IT-1040 on TWO lines, line 31, (correct placement), and line 34a, (inproper entry), also. This added income adjustment was summed as a double entry, and resulted in a tax error increase of $94. Turbotax 2005, by the way, handled this item properly.I print out and do a line-item verification of my forms but with TT2006, you cannot go back and affect an edit after printing. Pages are accessible and you can ""override"" data with resulting changes to the form but when you reprint, nothing is corrected. I will submit a hand prepared Ohio tax form this year. In my opinion, the state form preparation is poor and inaccurate."
2,Disappointing,"Picture is fine, controls are fine. But over half the time when a DVD is played, the disk reader makes enough noise to drown out the sound from the film. I'm returning it."
2,"Broken, I think?","We received this product in a somewhat odd package, which I'm not 100% protected it from damage. The TV probably works fine, but we only needed it to play DVDs for kids in our office, and as of now the DVD does not work. We will have to buy a DVD player now, to hook up to this old device!"
1,Don't Bite the (Red) Dust,"A book about Mars, should be interesting, right? Wrong! This book starts slow, stays slow and coasts to a stop at turtle speed. It takes the reader awhile to catch on to the social and political climate of the solar system since McAuley doesn't straight out tell you until later. Everyone is chasing Wei Lee because he's a threat to their plans. Gee, really exciting! As you can probably tell, there's not much of a plot. I congratulate myself for the willpower to stay with this book for 400 pages without throwing it in the trash. The book is tedious, very tedious. I recommend it only for insomniacs. A sure cure!"
5,Beyond the Balfour Declaration,I sent for this book because of my interest in knowing more about the Balfour Declaration than just that it opened a possibility for a Jewish homeland. In this thoroughgoing and apparently fair book I found so many parallels with our situation in Iraq that I abstracted it. It is packed with many interesting and important details that make the book emminently readable and lay bare the roots of the enduring Arab-Israeli confrontation.
3,"Disappointed at the company's claimed ""even assortment""","The lollipops are definitely yummy. My two little girls love them. I first ordered the counter bin and had only three flavors, very disappointing. Seeing that the company claimed that they made an effort to provide ""even assortment"" of flavors, I ordered the 5-pound bag. It is not true. Among the different flavored lollipops, my bag had 108 mango lollipops and only 28 grape ones. The order was directly from amazon and not fulfilled by amazon. So, it is not improved at all."
5,Tasty!,I'm not a huge sweet fan but when I do have a yen for something this is just the ticket. Interesting flavors and I've given these out at Halloween for a few years to good reviews from the neighborhood children. I love the product and will continue to give it out in years to come for as long as it is available.
4,Semi-Healthy way to curb your sweet tooth,I've recently rediscovered hard candies and lollipops. For around 20-30 calories what a great way to keep you busy for 10 minutes and keep you from having a 300-400 calorie candy bar. Also as far as lollipops these seem to be made pretty naturally. They are sweetened mostly with evaporated cane juice. Have not figured which is colors are what yet. So far the half dozen that I've had were tasty. Sure an apple is a much better alternative but having a couple of these a day ain't too bad and will prevent you from bigger sins.
5,Strawberry flavor,This bags of candies are very heavy but it made my happy. I love strawberry taste mostly. Very good! Not so sweet as I thought.
5,"YummyEarth Organic Lollipops, Assorted Flavors, 5-Pound bag",I love these lollipops. Every flavor is great except for pomegranate pucker it has a slight medicine taste. Besides that these suckers are delicious. I got an even amount of each flavor in my bag. I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about when they say you get like 5 of one flavor and 100 of another. My favorite flavor is wetface watermelon. With the 5-pound bag and the super-saver shipping you end up paying like $0.07 a sucker. What a deal! I highly recommend these suckers.
5,Everyone loves these lollipops!,"These are wonderful treats for kids and adults alike. Everyone who tries one, loves it. It doesn't even matter what flavor, as they are all delicious. I ordered a container for the office and had to get the 5-pound assortment for home to hand out for trick or treat. Thankfully, there were plenty left over for my family to enjoy. You won't go wrong buying this delicious organic candy."
4,Less damaging suckers,"If you give something sweet to somebody, this is a good way to minimize any problems they have with high fructose corn syrup. There is no HFCS in this candy. Adults love them too!!"
5,YummyEarth Organic Lollipops,These lollipops are great my kids love them.My son is allergic to food dyes so I was excited to find these!!!
2,Sour Taste,"If you like sour taste, you might like this! Otherwise, I am not impressed with this product. Definitely not worth the rave reviews."
1,Mislabeled,"The description of this product says, ""flavor assortment may vary,"" which is misleading. It should say, ""quantities of each flavor may vary drastically."" The five-pound bag I received contained (percentage of total is in parentheses) - 3 Very Cherry (1%), 14 Googly Grape (4%), 28 Tooberry Blueberry (9%), 30 Mango Tango (10%), 31 Strawberry Smash (10%), 38 Pomegranate Pucker (12%), 43 Sour Apple Tart (14%), and a whopping 126 Wet-Face Watermelon (40%). I didn't expect an equal assortment of each flavor, but the disparity is ridiculous. These 5-pound bags appear to be how Yummy Earth gets rid of their overstock."
2,Need QA Lollipops YummyEarth Assorted 5 lb bag,"My baby with multiple allergies seems to love them. Great! However, some QA problems either in shipping, or packing, or distribution by Amazon.Pros: Watermelon, Razmatazz, mango tango, and pomgranate pucker, orangeCons:1. Of 5 pound bag-3% error rate (350 suckers Total?)Out of 348 lollipop approx per nutritional label, there were6 Stray stick missing the head/wrapped plastic1 cracked melty looking one1 sucker intact without plastic2 empty plastic wrappers (no candy on stick found)Total: 10 mutant onesIt seems a better QA job could be done.Hope made in mexico has just as strict quality rules.Seals on the lollipop package don't seem completely airtight."
1,MORE SUGAR THAT MY KID DOESN'T NEED,"Yes, they do taste good, but they are just another sugar lollipop. At least the Candy Tree Lollipops aren't amde with cane sugar (or evaporated cane juice)and actually taste like fruit - not sweet fruit."
5,Best lollipops!,"I ordered these to give out on Halloween because they're organic and free of GMOs! I'm dressing up as a GMO Monster and advocating for GMO labeling in California, so it would be hypocritical to hand out candy full of GMO ingredients!I had a few to test the flavors, and they are AWESOME. Usually there are some flavors I don't like when I buy hard candy but I love every single one of these I've tried. I will buy again, for sure. nom nom nom"
5,Great Allergy-Free & Tasty,"Dealing with an allery to corn isn't easy, but these lollipops sure make it seem a lot easier. They're wonderfully flavored, organic, and made by a company who honestly cares about its customers. These are a great find and a staple of my house. They're just awesome, its hard to believe they're corn-free. *** UPDATE 2012 --These are no longer considered corn-free for anyone with a sensitive or severe corn allergy. Use caution."
4,awesome lollipops!,"I bought this product after reading the reviews. And I must say they are sooo good. I thought Jolly Rancher flavors were great, but these are by far better than ranchers. They don't burn your tongue, and the size of the lollipop is perfect - not to little, not too much. I took it to my workplace and folks loved it. I also shared it with a friend who's a teacher and she passed it to the kids in her class as treats. She told me the kids loved it as well.The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because there is room for improvement - I wish they add more flavors."
5,THESE ARE DELICIOUS !!!!!!!,"I bought the 5 lb bag. Mainly for my cousin who has food allergies, but also for Halloween. I made 200 treat bags and still had plenty left to bring to work, where they promptly were gobbled up.The flavors were intense in a good way without being over powerful and I didn't feel the usual sugar rush after eating one. A big plus for a diabetic. They were a little on the expensive side, but as my mom says you get what you pay for.I was very happy with the purchase and will definately be buying these again. wayyy before next halloween."
5,yummy,these are delicious.they're seriously the best suckers I've ever had!and they don't have any garbage in them!(aside from organic sugar...)
3,YummyEarth,I bring these to work and everyone goes nuts. They have a nice flavor and are very popular. I would like it better if they evened out the flavors more though; hence 3 stars.
3,Arrived damaged,I have had these before and they were very tasty. Unfortunately the bag was ripped when it arrived and looked like some had spilled out before it was boxed. I will not order again.
2,Yummy Lollipops hardly assorted,I was disappointed because I wanted to make up party favor bags containing each of the flavors but whereas there were tons of cherry there only a few - 13 to be exact - of the sour apple lollipops which of course is everyone's favorite. I had to buy more of the sour apple from a local organic store. Typically when a vendor bags an assortment they make sure there are equal amounts of each flavor but not in this case.
5,"Yummy lollipops, yummy price, cheaper that Costco...",These are great! I've ordered them twice and will continue to do so. The variety of fruity flavors are great.
5,Very Yummy!,"I bought these as a potty training incentive. We'll see how that works. I didn't pay anything thanks to gift cards.These are very tasty. They do not taste artificial at all and are very fruity tasting. I am pleased with this purchase, and of course, my two year old loves them! I don't feel bad about letting him have one because I know they are better than alternatives."
5,Yummy for sure and healthier than the average lollipop!,"We really enjoy the Yummy Earth Organic Lollipops! I am a mother of 6 that severely restricts refined sugar and artificial colors and flavors in my children's diets. My children beg for these lollipops thinking they are getting something I wouldn't normally allow them to have. They are my mother's little secret bribery for kids. They don't taste like a healthy junk-food alternative at all and I think they taste even better than the usual store-bought lollipop. Highly, highly recommend!"
4,good product,I keep it in my office to give to children--so far kids love it and I love the fact that it is sugar-free and I am not contributing to caries of their teeth;my only complaint about this product is there are a few broken ones and I even found empty wrappers without any lollipops in them!!
5,LOVE them,"I have picked them up at the local health food store for my daughter a couple times before I ordered them. We love them, they are delicious (without the guilt of a usual lollypop).I was concerned they might have melted in the mail, but they arrived in excellent condition.I will be ordering these again! (its going to take us a while to get through all 5lbs of them though)"
2,melted...,I reordered this item since we all liked it.but be aware not to order them in summer weather.candies are melted and sticky...it was totally fresh and had no problem when i ordered during cool season.
1,Concerned about lead in mexico's water and factorys,Mexico does not have the same standards forProduction of food stuff as the u s. I got intestinal problems and cramping after eating these and chewing on the paper stick. I am very concerned about this import
5,Yummy yum yum!,It's a giant bag of tasty lollipops that also happen to be organic. What's not to love?
4,Great value,This bulk bag is a way to get these relatively healthy lollipops (they're still candy!) at a price that's a fraction of the cost of buying them in the supermarket. Highly recommended
5,Great Item!,"This is the second time I have purchased a 5 pound bag of these lollipops! They have no artificial colors or flavors, the kids love them, and I don't have to worry about any side effects from too much sugar. I passed them out to my university class on Halloween and they loved them, too, especially the pomegranate pucker flavor. I cannot foresee a time when I will discontinue buying this product."
3,Great Lollipops but bad variety,"While these taste great, I can't give it 5 stars due to the fact that I got mostly blueberry flavor. I was expecting more of the mango but I only counted 7 of them, a bunch of the sour apples and cherry.Once they do a better job at the variety, I will buy more but not for now. They should probably sell them by flavors."
5,best lollipops ever!!,"I originally started buying these for my 3yr old as a good organic sweet treat, but since then they have grown into a favorite family treat. My husband takes some to work, I keep them in my purse and even my parents have taken to them. The variety pack allows you to try all the flavors, I really like the mango and the pomegranate. Try them I'm sure you will be pleased with these sweet suckers without all the junk of other lollipops!"
5,"Yes, they really are good!","I am a mom of four, who tries to balance a limited grocery budget with the healthiest food that my family can eat. I keep making more and more changes as I gather more information and products like this become so readily available. Anyway, I have been concerned about food dyes lately but still wanted my kids to be able to have some kind of a candy treat. I thought I would give these a try. I just got them yesterday. I haven't given any to the kids yet (I am saving them for Christmas), but I also didn't want to wait until then and find out from the kids that they were horrible. So, I performed my own taste test of three of the flavors, and I found them to be delicious. I know the kids will love them!"
1,Bad Mix of Flavors,"Last time I got a very reasonable assortment of flavors.This time (June 2010) I got three pounds of Wet-Face Watermelon and two pounds of TooBerry Blueberry.Everyones' tastes are different. For me, I am not a fan of Wet-Face Watermelon. And, I kid you not, the TooBerry Blueberry tastes like a wet dog.So I will give away the Watermelon pops at Halloween. The local kids will like them.And the Wet Dog flavored pops go on my desk at work for all those freeloading coworkers who steal my candy! ;)"
3,"good ,but not sugarfree","great tasting pops ,but w/ high cost of filling dental caries ,a sugarfree alternative might be more practical ,especially if rinsing w/ water after using is not an option"
4,A healthy SWEET alternative to a sucker treat for your child!,"I was really happy when I found this item for my son. I've used suckers in the past to treat my son but the fact that I was allowing such trash to enter his body really wore on my mind. When I found these organic suckers, I was so excited. Amazon delivered these quickly and securely. My son and I tried them when they arrived, and to my surprise, they tasted REALLY good. My son seems to enjoy them too, not quite as much as the 'regular' suckers I suppose however. The only thing I would have to say that is negative would be that these suckers are maybe a little too sweet! Yes, an organic item that is sweeter than non-organic. It's only the sugar that is naturally found in the fruits used to make the suckers, but they are SWEET. Overall I would really recommend this to healthy-minded moms as a treat for kiddos!"
5,Great Lollipops!,"These small treats are great. Flavorful, not too sweet, give one taste ""orgasms.""Priced right, good for sharing with co-workers, students, etc."
5,Kids and Parents LOVE THEM,"This was our group's 2nd year including this in our annual holiday gathering snack sacks. The kids love their delicious,vibrant and unique flavors. Parents always hope there are extras for them to also enjoy! They are especially wonderful for kids with allergies and parents who choose to stick to a healthier snack!"
5,Awesome allergy friendly lollipops!,"Yummy Earth makes awesome lollipops! It is so nice for my daughter to share these with her friends who have food allergies and know they are safe for our gluten free needs too. The only flavor that has gotten a thumbs down from our family and most (all?) of her friends is Tooberry Blueberry. Though they are organic, that flavor tastes artificial and rather unpleasant. I figure at some point, there will be nothing left but TooBerry in the bag.I have used these to melt and mold with my own hard candy molds and they came out great! It is so hard to find special occasion candy that is organic/natural, allergy friendly and reasonably priced. None of the kids get left out on special days!"
3,"OK COLLECTION, BUT...","... what's really missing is his stellar contribution to the ""Night Shift"" movie soundtrack, ""Girls Know How"", a catchy uptempo number with great horn charts.I only wish I could have seen Al live in concert during his 80's prime!"
4,The early years,"I first was introduced to Al Jarreau back while I was in graduate school in the late 70's. This album does a wonderful job of showcasing many of his great songs. I only wish that it included his rendition of Leon Russell's ""Rainbox in Your Eyes"", plus that sexy ballad of his ""Teach Me Tonight"". Either would have been a better choice for the serious Jarreau fan than the theme from Moonlighting.If anyone has ever heard the LP version of these two songs....they would definitely agree they should be placed on the all time greatest hits CD."
2,"Bad pop, not enough jazz","Well, since I'm a jazz fan you might say I'm biased:this CD contains very very little of Al's scatting and rhythmical virtuosity that made jazz fans feel so sorry he chose commercial success instead of art... True, I borrowed this CD from a multimedia library and returned it after one listening.But, as far as Jarreau's commercial side is concerned, I own a Dutch-produced audio tape of his ""best"" songs that is equally commercial, but still doesn't emphasize songs that make him sound like Kenny G of singing...So, where there should be more jazz, I found quite a lot of dubious and bad pop music... Don't get me wrong, there is still some fine pop and even occasional hints of Jareau's jazz greatness, but it's so darn little..."
4,a good disc,his talent is really Large.his voice is timeless.the Quality is 100% solid.this is a good disc but so is many of his other albums.he has a style that is all his own.the man can sing any style and make it his own.
4,Could have been better than this,I've been a fan since my younger days. Al Jarreau has lots of good and memorable songs. Unfortunately only some of them are included in this CD. Wish a more appropriate and representative CD will be released in the future
1,This music drives me crazy!,"After working at a drugstore for about two weeks i kept hearing this cd, without knowing the name, and noting that ""Spain(I can remember) ""is one of the most annoying songs ever. I finally foujd out this guys name. I dont know who he is, but hes made me, on many occasion, want to rip the cd player out of the wall, and smash it too bits..Its awful- and annoying...The music is trite, predicabale, and absolute nonsense. Surley, this man must have something better to do than to make cds that anony stockboys at drugstores.,,,,This cd sucks"
2,Lousy transfer ruins good movies,"Watching the movies in this cheapo set is like being underwater. The pictures are distorted, miscolored and blurry, the sound like it was recorded by holding a microphone up to a wall with the actors on the other side. Seek out a different print of these films."
3,Ahh I love Frida!,"I wanted to rate this 5 stars before I even saw it just because I love Frida so much. The main problem I had with this movie was the narrator. It was sooo irritating to hear him so heinously mispronounce so many names of people and places. And mispronounce differently at different times. It would have been really cool to hear at least a woman narrator and maybe even a Mexican Woman narrator. But at least the guy could have sounded like he looked over the script and confirmed the pronunciations. Ugh! It was really cool to see so many of her works of art and so many photos. Some photos and paintings that I had never seen before. Like I said, I love Frida! I just wish that I felt the narrator did too or at least respected her enough to know the script."
1,Another year of bugs and horrible support,"Shame on me for buying this each year. For the third year in a row it has bugs and the support this year is just as bad as the previous ones. My Illinois State return, which I bought online through the federal product, keeps generating late payment charges on my return, despite the fact that taxes aren't due for another month. The wait time to speak to a foreigner on the phone is 60 minutes, and the email support is ludicrous because the people answering the emails take longer than the phone hold queue to respond, and come back with nonsense."
2,Has Bugs,"My husband is the tax guy in our family. We used turbo tax in previous years as well as Quicken. For the last five days he has been trying to get the tax information into the program to run a proof on the taxes owed, etc. He has a business, and I am a realtor so we have a lot of home deductions, and small business expenses. He gets to the bottom line, and realizes the program never asked him, during the interview portion, for home office expense, car expense, and several other items that he claimed last year on the tax return. He had to manually go back and enter the items, then the program froze. He had saved it ""early and often"", but when he reopened the program, it didn't have any of the saved information! He is such a hard head, he did it again... and again... and that same scenerio keeps happening. It is a dog..."
3,Turbo Tax Business 2006 Corporation and Partnerships,"I purchased this product to complete the company tax returns in 2007 for 2006. The product was very easy to use and allowed me to file me taxes on time without the headache. However, you have to repurchase the product each year; there are not upgrades."
5,Much Improved,The 2006 version is much improved over earlier versions. It took me only an average of 2 hours each to do two trust returns.
3,One of the cheapest prices out there....,"I sometimes wonder about buying this each year or just doing my 1120S forms by hand. I'm a really small corp, but im lazy. For $82.99 with free shipping (Its $17 less than Intuit wants directly) it removes an excuse to doing my corporate taxes and getting them out of the way.The program hasnt changed much over the years, and this year is no exception.I still cannot import my QuickBooks Mac data file.Support is all ala carteIf it wasnt for the nearly idiot resistant interface, I'd go with the competition.Hopefully some year they will make a Mac native version. Running this under VirtualPC has been troublesome."
1,Intuit SUCKS,"Turbo Tax is fine. The linking into Quickbooks Pro (QBP) is limited to only the most recent 2 versions of QBP. So if you have an older version (older than 2005) you have to buy the new QBP to have Turbo Tax lift the data out of QB. Now Intuit will only sell a new version of 2007 - NO MORE UNGRADES. ""For the consumer"" they will tell you. BS, I will be changing accounting platforms as soon as I can find a replacement. This is the problem with software oligolopies! An Open Source replacement is much needed for both Tax prep and accounting."
1,Just got Worser,"This program will not let you modify Schedule C once you've input information.Also, I don't yet know about this years program but last years program rounded off number incorrectly. Turbo Tax always rounded down and never up, it benefited the taxpayer, I eventually had to redo the caluclations manually."
3,It's NOT a vinyl building,"It's a metal building with vinyl coating.It came in a million pieces.it took 7 hours for two people to assemblelooks good, but what a pain!"
4,old stalwart,"Lonely Planet is great for inexhaustible lists of information that you cannot possibly go through, like hotel listings, restaurants, nightlife, plus some interesting background info on history, culture, politics, and the like.I just got back from a week's vacation in Rome and I found that Lonely Planet was really useful for finding my way around the city (pretty decent maps) and finding lodging and local phone numbers. As for actually exploring places of interest, I found Rick Steves' Rome much more detailed and fun to follow."
2,Disappointing guide,"This guide is, sadly to say, disappointing considering it is a Lonely Planet publication. In planning my next trip to Rome, I thought that this might be a great book to work from, but I found it to be poorly organized and overcrowded. The authors of this book crammed way too much information into this book that it borders on unusable. There are also very few photos and what photos are provided are not very helpful.Other Lonely Planet Guides to Rome would be a better choice than this. National Geographic Traveler Rome Guide is more insightful and will orientate the reader much better than this book will.It does come with a decent map that can be torn out, but it's paper. My only concern with that is being caught out in the rain. The map doesn't seem durable, and I wonder if it would even survive the trip. So if you're in the market for a guidebook to Rome, check out Lonely Planet's other options (besides this book), Nat'l Geographic Travelers Rome Guide, or Rome for Dummies."
2,Read Glamorama and Fight Club...,"and don't bother with this. It's a blatant (and much less involving) ripoff of those excellent books. It is also complete propaganda- it's only reason for existing is to change people's minds. I happen to agree with a lot of the ideas it promotes, but that doesn't make propaganda acceptable, and it certainly doesn't make propaganda good art. Come to think of it, read Fight Club and Glamorama to see where the story and style come from, and read Jacques Ellul's The Technological Society and maybe Morris Berman's Wandering God for the philosophical/political/spiritual ideas."
3,Cute Watch...Doesn't wear well,I loved this watch when it came in the mail...but the outer silver lining scratched extremely easily and quickly. Also the watch ticks very loudly!
5,Rare short stories authorized by the London Estate,"Of the many collections of Jack London short stories, this one has to be the best. Of the 50 stories authorized by Jack London's family, there are two versions of London's famous ""To Build a Fire""- the original he wrote in 1902 and the the more famous one that he rewrote in 1908 from memory of the original version.Notes at the end of the book give insight to each story detailing his struggles to get many published, the amount he was paid, and commentary from Jack on some of them."
5,Authentic?,"According to one reviewer, the music on this CD is not authentic. I suppose the reviewer should know, since he says he is from Paraguay. My knowledge of South American folkmusic, on the other hand, is very superficial. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this CD as something very soothing and amusing."
2,Not authentic,"This is a very commercialized version of paraguayan songs. I'm from paraguay, and did not enjoy listening to this CD. I highly recommend Explorer Series: Paraguay - Guarani Songs and Dancesinstead."
3,10 disc and master of the macabre,"Have viewed Murder and Blackmail, and both are probably the same old transfers mentioned in other reviewsThis is a repacked master of the macabre double set.Sound on blackmail was actually pretty good, considering its age.So, it would be nice for someone to run them through a descratching program.............."
5,A wonderful blast from the past!,"For many years I wished and wished that I could once again enjoy this cartoon masterpiece from the 80's. Now I finally can. I remember growing up watching this show and getting in trouble at school because I was always drawing my own monster minds cartoons. What makes this even better is that I get to enjoy it in English. Although I do speak a little spanish, I am not fluent and back then, this cartoon only aired on the Spanish network where I grew up. I strongly suggest that this DVD is purchased by anyone who still has a bit of the 80's left in them. Especially for the kids of today and the kids of tomorrow!"
3,"Good for everyday, not water resistant","I bought this as an inexpensive more heavy-duty watch that can be cleaned easily. It performed ok and I found it user-friendly for what I needed at work. However, I was very disappointed at its lack of water resistance. I went snorkeling with it and it became water logged in less than 10 feet of water and doesn't work anymore. I'm trying to get it repaired/replaced by the manufacturer."
1,worst of the biker rags,"gave it a 1, just because it had bikes in the rag, but seriously this rag is close to kiddie porn,if you really want a v-twin biker mag,check out American-Iron,Us Rider News [formally Dixie-Rider],and HotRodsBikeWorks mag. you won't be disappointed in any of these three. but stay away from easyriders unless your more into kiddie porn than bikes."
1,easyrider sucks,"I like choppers and babes;but sleds are the main thing that makes you wonder which is the beauty and which is the beast!The rag falls short of being informational and useful.If the price was 5.00 per year maybe a good deal.Im glad I subcribed this time,to see how far down it has gone.ADIOS SUCKA!!!!"
5,Yeah!,You better have your girl tame before you get this mag. Full of all the right bikes with lots of curves and booby shots. Pure American Man magazine!
4,A Warlock Biker Sez:,"I enjoy the cool bikes and hot witches that Easyriders has to offer. Another good selection to put in granny's donut house (the bathroom) ,is the 1% favorite, ""Outlaw Biker."" Both these magazines are old school and way kewl, in my book. But do not just believe reviews pick up a copy of either of these great magazines and decide for yourself."
2,Does NOT run true to size,"I was excited to get this shirt on sale from Amazon, but when it arrived and I opened the box - let's say I was very much disappointed. I ordered the XXL and it fits our 8 year old daughter. Seems to be a nice quality shirt, but runs no where true to size."
1,made in children's size only,I ordered this for my sister in law as a christmas gift. I ordered a large and it would probably work well for my 37 pound 5 yr old. very disappointed!!
5,It's an educational children's book,This book is soo good. I grew up on it as a child in Cuba and it's just as I remember it. Marti was not only a genius but loved children. Adults can benefit from reading the book. It's thought provoking.
3,Gaite Parisienne--1954 production,"This DVD is in black and white with rather poor sound quality. The frame speed has been accelerated to make the dancers seem faster than they actually are. The dancing is generally good, though, as is the music."
2,A ballet curiosity,"Over a period of ten years Victor Jessen, a ballet buff, filmed in thirty-second ""takes"" from various locations in many different theaters perfromances of Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo doing ""Gaite Parisienne"". He went to one last performance with an audio recorder to capture the Ballet Russe orchestra and then laboriously edited the film. It is in black and white. This would be of most interest to ballet history buffs."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"I was a teenager when the Ballet Russe performed this ballet on their visit to southern Florida. I saw it twice. First at the Dade County Auditoriun in Miami. After which I ran to get a bunch of tickets to their performance at the Miami Beach Auditorium. I brought everyone I knew who would be dazzled. Both venues were less than ideal, but who cared. The dancing and brilliant choreography made up for these difficult performance spaces. Ah! What memories ... I have never forgotten seeing all those legendary dancers. If you like classical dance, buy this DVD and discover the foundation they established for today's dancers to build upon."
2,Not especially effective,"I used this set to prepare on the flight for a trip to Brazil. I must admit that I did learn to say ""please"" and ""thank you"", as well as ""pleased to meet you"", but otherwise, I did not find this to be an effective way to learn. Granted, I did not use the set as recommended (daily for a period of time). After two trips to Brazil, I got serious about learning Brazilian Portuguese, and with the help of others' reviews, I hit upon the Pimsleur materials. They are the most expensive of any I have found, but also truly effective, so that they turn out to be a very good value. I use them in the car, and after only four lessons can carry on some basic conversation. They are almost as good as live one-on-one lessons with a native teacher. Don't pay full price for Pimsleur; brand new sets are discounted on various online venues."
3,Not loving it,"This is and OK product. I was a little disappointed that the Cd's included only seem to have the vocabulary words on them, and not much in the way of conversation teaching. the book that comes with it has a lot of information, but I don't think this is good for quick learning. I am used to Michel Thomas language Cd's, and guess I was expecting the same kind of instruction. Not a bad language course, but not that great."
5,"A ""must have"" for a new mother with a todler.","This book has been a saving grace. I have a very active todler, and just had a new baby. This book offers great ideas for keeping my todler busy and entertained. My favorites are ""Rainy Day Play"" and ""Out and About."" These activities are easy to prepare and convenient to take along on errands and/or Dr. Visits."
2,don't waste your money,"After deciding to take the summer off with my kids, I bought this book thinking it would help me get creatively busy with my energetic boys. Maybe my expectation of the book was too high -- it had gotten great reviews. But I must say that I'm quite disappointed with the book. Not as many original creative ideas as I thought there would be, and not many easy and fun activities. A lot of activities required supplies that I needed to go buy."
3,it was okay,there are better ones out there to spend your money on.It did get here on time and in conditon.
4,"Easy activities, more suitable for younger kids","My boy is 5 years old. He eagers for activities. So I bought this book to get more ideas. The book has all kinds of ideas to keep the kids busy. However, I think the activities are more suitable for 3-4 years old. Like wash a nickle, bubbles etc. for 5 years old, these were old tricks. But I still give a 4 star because I got inspired by the book and create activities for my boy. The missing star was caused for two reasons: 1 it is for younger kids. 2. there is not pictures at all. I don't mind it since I was reading it, but it would be nice to have pictures so that the kid can read with me. None of these is a big problem, that is why they worth half of a start each."
4,Alright....,"I just got this book and it has some cute, easy games and activities. I don't know that I would call them creative. Some are things like ""let's go pick up the neighborhood trash"" Uh.... no thanks. My neighbors can pick up their own trash and they can clean up their own yards.Other than a few ""misses"" it really is full of ideas and fun."
5,Great ideas,This has some really great ideas. I highly recommend it. It is also worth mentioning that I use some of the ideas with both my 3 year old and my 1 year old.
3,Mediocre Activities,"Most of the activities in this book are things you probably already do or have already tried already. Though, there are still suggestions that are unique and fun to do nevertheless. The descriptions are not detailed and not too complicated.It's a good resource to have for those who may be babysitting your toddler. However, I am sure you can find these type of activities on websites. I guess I was expecting a little more than what I got.I think the activities included in this book are fair."
4,Wealth of ideas but many need prep,"My son enjoyed some of the activities in the toddler book, so I got this one too and had about the same reaction. There's a lot of good ideas in here to keep kids busy, but a lot of them need prep time. None of the activites they list are hard to do, but there aren't a lot of ""spur of the moment"" ideas. The best thing to do is to read the entire book, pick out 3-5 activities you think your child(ren) would like, and put the materials for those activities in a set place, like a box or a bin. When the kids get bored with those activities, go back to the book and start over. All in all I like this book series, it's got a lot of great ideas. Just expect to lay a little groundwork..."
2,I hate to be the one to leave a negative review...,"but I found this book to be very flimsy. Do we really need yet another recipe for glue, play dough, and other things that can be purchased ready made very cheaply? Out of the 365 ""games and activities"" in this book, I'd have to say I found maybe 3 to 5 that I might try. Most of the others would pretty much come to any Mom's mind naturally, and a lot of them are just useless."
5,Best Kids Book for Moms!,This is the best book for moms. It's packed with creative ideas that are easy and inexpensive. You can get your kids busy with something new everyday of the year!
3,worth it but doesn't have the most original ideas,"Pretty good book, my three year old actually likes me to read the activities to him and fantasize about what we might do. But we still haven't done any of them from the book yet. Some stuff I have already found on the internet and some stuff just doesn't sound that fun. But I suppose it is good if you are really at your wits end. Otherwise you can find so many activities on the internet already."
1,Trivializing and unoriginal,"When I bought this book, I was misled into thinking it was a book for military families. The author has never been in a military family and is not a military wife. She often compares deployment to her son going away to college. The ideas she gives are unoriginal and some downright idiotic (i.e. buy a sticker supporting your military branch for your car, then you'll feel close to your service member). I was extremely disappointed and angered that this was a book penned to military families when there are very little ideas addressing deployments specifically, rather just separations like business trips."
5,Helpful ideas for deployed military families,"A great book for families, a great resource for Armed Forces Family Readiness Groups! This book provides realistic ideas and numerous activities to do before, during, and after deployment. It can be used by any branch of service and every circumstance that a deployed service member is affected. I personally did many of the activites suggested, and feel more connected to my deployed husband because of them! What a great asset for spouses and children of our service members."
2,not the best,"i love to read any thing about a military family, just to see how we all deal with it was not like this till hubby went to iraq. Now this was one of the 1st i read and well it was ok then now i have read so many I can tell you this is ok there are better out there"
1,Music??,"I confess that I only listened to the samples, not the whole CD. I'm not sure if I could tolerate that. What I heard on the samples was the oddest assortment of screeches, howls, atonal sounds from musical instruments,( at least I think they were; reminded me of the sounds small children make when they pick up an instrument and just blow on it when they've had no training).There was no rhythm, no song, nothing that would remotely bring to mind the concept of music.Maybe it's a joke. I hope so!"
5,A FIRST-RATE COLLECTION OF GAMES!,"The book opens with 22 pages of guidelines for successfully using games. The remainder of the book is a collection of 33 games specifically designed for a wide range of circumstances. The games consist of icebreakers, energizers, team games, and individual exercises. Each game is geared to one or more of 11 Away Days agendas: celebration; challenge of change; conference; consolidation; consultation; creativity; decision making; morale; planning; problem solving; and team building. (FYI, for more about planning Away Days see ""Legendary Away Days"" in which the authors detail how to design and run a whole event.) Each game presented in this book is fully described, including purpose, type of game, most suitable for, numbers, time required, preparation, materials, and specifics on game content, steps, debriefing, and pitfalls. For any one who trains and develops others, this is a first-rate resource."
2,Not what I wanted at all,"This is a very thin cover. The only reason it has two stars and not one star is because it fits my parrot's cage. The material is almost like a light nylon-type material (but a just a little stiffer). I was expecting a heavier, canvas-like material that might block sunlight and keep my bird warm at night. Light gets in very easily. It is also very thin and shape-less. It can very easily slide off the cage if someone were to brush it while walking past. I would not recommend this product if you are trying to keep your bird warm or trying to give it a dark place to rest."
2,"It works, I guess","I got this cage cover for my Sun Conure's Prevue Hendryx Cage (36 x 24 x 67''), and it works, I guess. The material is a thin polyester or rayon blend and the front flap leaves two large gaps at the corners. I got it on sale, which is the only reason I bought it. However, for the same price, you can buy black denim from a craft store and sew your own cage cover, which is what I did."
5,FUNNIEST VOLUME,"This so far is the best volume of Galaxy Angel so far. I loved the episode where Forte (My favorite angel by the way) had to pretend to be dead for Ranpha, I laughed so hard I almost peed my pants! The Episode with the runaway tank is great to, and the monkey episode is very funny to. This is the best volume of the first season for volume 4 was sadly kind of boring. and I have yet to see the Z episodes. But like I said this is my Favorite volume so if you liked the first two volumes you'll LOVE this volume a lot."
2,This was the worst dvd in the Galaxy Angel series!,"Being a true Galaxy Angel fan, I recently bought this dvd with very high expectations since all of the other Galaxy Angel dvd's are awesome. I have to say though, that this particular dvd was not worth what I spent on it. Even though the art was amazing, (as always) I did not find the story funny or interesting at all! A major disappointment! =("
5,Fantastic Knife Set,I must say that these knives were the best investment that I have made in a long time. I am a chef and I have not had the money to make a significant investment in a great set of knives in a very long time. I finally came across this set on Amazon and I couldn't pass it up. The price was just too right! $179.99 for this set was unbelievable!! The 8-inch Chef Knife goes for over a $100 by itself. I have to say that the first time I used the Chef knife I was so ecstatic!! It's been to long since I used a quality knife and I cannot rave about the Pro-S Henckels. This set has all the knives that you will use on a daily basis to prepare meals in your kitchen. With these knives you can do anything that you want and the sharpening steel is a definite bonus. Buy these knives for yourself or any other knife/cooking enthusiast!! You cannot get any better!
5,Henckels pro S-3 starter set,"Knives are excellent, sharp as a razor. Quality that shows!! I have made many purchases through Amazon.com and would not hesitate recommending buying from them. Excellant service and never any problem dealing with their customer service."
1,2 Hours and 37 Minutes of Nothing!,"What a waste of time. What a waste of money. And what the ""halibut"" happened to Daryl Hannah? She looks like a victim of plastic surgery gone awry. She should have given it up years ago. So sad. Don't spend a penny on this. And why was it two-hours plus? It would have bombed as a 30-minute short flick! I'm not sure if the actors and actresses looked worse than the phoney sharks. I hate films that repeat scenes over and over again. Every underwater scene...maybe 40 of them...were the same footage. Just horrible. Trust me...avoid...avoid...avoid!!!"
1,"Naive, outdated material","As a professional mentalist and former college professor, I found the material in Practical Mindreading to be anything but practical. Nowhere in the book's description does it say that the book was written in the early 1900s. The author gushes about the ""scientifically proven"" phenomenae he has observed, without presenting any concrete validation. Other than as a treatise on Victorian naivetee, this poorly researched and written book is worthless."
5,A great book,Keechie is a very well written book exploring human relationships in an unusual style. An older Indian woman living a life of relative isolation meets a modern times young boy and develops the type of friendship that will last a lifetime.Keechie explores survival and gives the reader an opportunity to explore their own thinking about humanity. It is also a fun read with a very interesting story line.I recommend this book to anyone wanting quality literature in their home library. JR
4,NEVERENDING FENCING,IF YOU LIVE OUT IN THE COUNTRY FENCING BECOMES A TOPIC THAT COMES UP CONSTANTLY. THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO PUT A FENCE UP BUT OF THOSE ONLY A FEW WILL LAST AND BE EFFECTIVE. THIS BOOK REVIEWS MANY TYPES OF FENCING IN DEPTH. I LOOK TO THIS BOOK FOR MANY OF MY FENCING QUESTIONS.
4,"Older book, but very helpful","I bought this book and after reading through it, I have installed 3 fences out in our pasture. The Seller shipped quickly. I could have gotten the book at the library, but it was helpful having it at my place."
2,if you want to build an electric fence then okay..,"..this book would work for you as it spends three or four ENTIRE chapters on electic fences. other than that if you can dig a hole, put a post in the group and nail a board you will not learn anything."
1,BAD COPY OF DVD,"THE MOVIE IN ITSELF WAS GREAT, AWESOME, A CLASSIC YOU SHOULD HAVE AS PART OF YOUR VIDEO LIBRARY. HOWEVER, THE COPY I PURCHASED FROM VIVEROS, PARTNER OF AMAZON, REALLY SUCKED. IT APPEAR TO BE A BOOTLEG COPY OF A DVD. VERY DARK, COULD NOT SEE THE PICTURE. FOR FUTURE REFERENCE, BUY STRICTLY FROM AMAZON AND NOT ITS AFFFILIATES, CAN'T BE GUARANTEE THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT VERSES AMAZON, ALWAYS CARRIES ORIGINALS."
1,BEWARE THIS TRANSFER,"5 STARS FOR THE ORIGINAL MOVIE; a gentle wonderful Christmas movie like they just don't make anymore. 1 star for Treasure Box Duplicators of China, and I wish i could rate lower. This transfer is absolutely wretched. A stated digital remaster; the original has serious flaws including scratched negative, many missing frames, and poor sound. None of which are corrected! Add to this the cheapest shabbiest tape running at budget EP speed. Add to that poorly serviced slave duplicators which result in a near untrackable mess. BUY RUPERT BUT DO NOT BUY THIS TREASURE BOX JUNK TRANSFER!"
1,Neither useful nor interesting.......,"I found this book dull and boring; neither useful nor interesting. Many words, saying little..... There are hundreds of books on watercolor that are far better."
3,Not for the beginner,"The book is well written and the illustrations are of good quality (important for an art instruction book).However, as a person who has some experience in watercolor, this book is not for beginners. I would recommend that someone start with a beginners book, then progress to a book like this. Also, the book deals almost exclusively with still lifes. I would like to have seen some exercises with landscapes also."
2,reproductions limp,Text not all that helpful. And the pics of stuff in the book are faded and not of good quality
5,Great,This is one of the few books I have seen that gives such clear demonstrations of how to use watercolours. I wish I'd bought it years ago.
2,Interesting but not very catching,I found this book to have a very interesting subject matter however the writing itself sometimes put me to sleep. The athor dwells on facts very insignificant to the purpose of the story and therefor the reader must wade through all of that to pull out the important history his is retelling. My suggestion is find another book about the same topic. This book may turn some off so they never learn about the rich history of the mexican-american herritage in this country.
5,The book was in excellent condition,"Thanks for the affordable book. The condition is used but it looks like brand new. I will highly recommend this seller.Thank you so much for selling this cheap and quality book, it could help us/average income family that needs book for our children."
1,Barrio Boy,"I found ""Barrio Boy"" to be very boring, as a matter of fact I didn't even try to finish the book. So save your money and buy something better."
1,Horrible Worst Gun Ever Never Buy From this person!,The top BLEW OF OF THE GUN AND IT IS ALL PLASTIC NOT MEDAL.I got the gun cause it looked awsome and I though cool a strong spring gun. The top started comeing off after 2 then 1 shots. It was so weak it could not go through paper. I wish I could get another gun and shoot the guy who sold this to me and then the gun would brake because it is so flimsy.
3,An okay book,"I got this book thinking that it would give me an in-depth analysis of RTP and real-time streaming over the Internet. There is only one chapter (ch. 19) devoted to this subject, and believe me, it will not leave you satisfied.The reason I give 3 stars to the book is because it's not bad all together. In other words, it gives bits and pieces and explains what works with what, but just when you are ready for more, the chapter ends and you feel like somebody just took food out of your mouth, just when you were enjoying it and ready to swallow.Also if you want JMF 2.0 stuff save yourself some money because the book covers only JMF 1.1"
1,The author is not responsible for readers!!,"I am a graduate student in computer science major. I have to say that's the worst book I had read. First, this book does not provide the complete clear explanation for some concepts. It just intruduces something, but never go to detail. Second, so many mistakes coming out this books, I am wondering how could this book coming out for the market? Third, the source code does not work at all. There are so many bugs in it, and code provided has some key mistakes! As a student, I bought this book for my research project and I was very disappointed!! I suggested if you want to buy some books about JMF, please do check first! JMF reference guide from sun is a nice reference. Good luck!"
1,Book is just an Overview of JMF,Well I bought this book thinking I would be able to do some serious JMF programming but was displeased. I found this book give just an overview and does not go deep enough. My suggestion is not to buy this book. It is not at all in league with other Core Java Books.
1,Do not waste your money on this video!,"This video is very boring. It had all but 1 minute of my 2 year old son's attention. My 5 month old wasn't even interested! There's nothing entertaining or educational about it, but to put you to sleep. I turned it to something else after about 7 minutes of torture. I can't see how this DVD got so many stars. I don't know maybe it gets better after about 7 minutes. If you want to buy something that's good for your little ones to watch; get the HBO classical baby and the Brainy Baby DVD's. My 2 and a half year old loves them both. We have four of the Brainy Baby's (very educational) and the three pack of the Classical Baby that I originally purchased for my 5 month old, but my 2 year old can't get enough of that. So please don't waste your money on this DVD."
2,Disappointed,"I must admit I'm disappointed. I love the female body especially when she's having an orgasm. I can watch that for a long time and never get tired of it. However, The male orgasm is a completely different story. I DON'T ever want to see that again! The film makers did an excellent job of picking people at varying ages to display the many appearances of orgasm. However, When they mixed the 2 sexes together it became very difficult for me to watch. Therefore I recommend these 2 things to the film makers should they either re-release this dvd or make a new one.1) Keep the sexes melding together, however, have an additional chapter where its the men only and one of the women only. That way the video would appeal to more people.2) Get rid of the socio-political commentary. The people should just orgasm and leave.Thats my 2 cents and I'm sticking to it. :)"
1,NOT GLUTEN FREE,"These soups are listed in the gluten free foods. Please read ingredients. This is an example of incorrect listings. If you have celiac disease, as I do, do not assume foods that are listed in this category are truly gluten free. And, Amazon, please find a way to better regulate this. By the way, the one star rating has nothing to do with the soup, I cannot eat this, the rating is for the listing."
4,Excellent Value!,All of Dr McDougall's soups are very good and guilt free! They are delicious and filling and extremely easy to prepare. You can add them to other dishes to enhance their flavor.
2,Hard and spicy,"I found this soup too spicy for my tastes. Also, even when I allowed the soup to steep for the directed amount of time, several of the noodles and veggies were hard."
2,Tried It....Didn't Like It....,"Simply put, this flavor doesn't do it for me. Think I'll just stick with the Chicken Ramen Cups and the Hot & Sour Ramen Cups--they are among my favorite flavors. 'Nuff said."
1,Lumpy soup,Could not get it to dissolve completely. It would have been OK if it dd not have so many lumps.
3,"meh, it's not the best","What I like about this product is the ability to open it up and clean out the inside. It works well when you can get the opening, which is larger than other aspirators, into the baby's nose, but it's a challenge. The opening is designed to only go so far in though, an added safety benefit, but frustrating when there's a glob of snot beyond it's reach. I bought a little rubber aspirator on vacation and found it does the trick better than this product. Also, the casing and parts are bulky and take up a lot more space than the little rubber one, hence, me not bringing it on vacation."
2,Stick with Hospital Freebie,"We read in some book/magazine that this was recommended so we bought it. Our 6 month old (in the 90th percentile) just got over her first cold so we had an opportunity to use it. We found that the Summer Infant Nasal Aspirator did not work anywhere near as well as the hospital freebie one. The hospital one had more suction and it could be directed to the sides of the nostril better, where more of the mucus lay."
4,Author signature,"I purchased a copy as a christmas gift for my grandson.He is a volunteer fire chief and his father's name is in the roster.The book had been signed by the author to ""Dan"". His name is Jason.It was nice to have it signed but not to the wrong person. I did notgive the name so it had to be signed for someone else."
3,"Good stories, stiff writing","The stories are heartwarming, but the writing is stiff and labored. The stories all sound like they were told by the same person; the ""voice"" of each individual storyteller is lost."
5,A compelling anthology of true life stories,"The Heart Behind The Hero is a compelling anthology of true life stories, essays and poems contributed by firefighters and paramedics across the country. Touching, inspiring, heartwarming, dramatic, superbly written and presented, The Heart Behind The Hero reveals the emotions, feelings, and spirit of today's American firefighters and rescue workers in their own words. The humor, pathos, heartbreak, and hard work is clearly evident as the contributors pay tribute to their colleagues and comrades who sacrificed their lives doing a job they loved in service to the communities in which they lived. Here is a fascinating ""window"" into the lifestyles and thoughts of brave men and women whose heroism is routine and whose sacrifices are the stuff of which legends are made."
3,"Heartwarming, Emotive, Repetitive",Positive stories from the field that transformed the lives of fire and rescue personnel. Provides insight into the role of the career and volunteer fire and rescue person. Somewhat repetitive in its themes and persons interviewed. Easy read that can be finished in a couple of days.
3,An insightful and touching quick read,"I am not a firefighter or an EMT. I don't know anyone that is. But I got The Heart Behind the Hearo book because the subject matter seemed interesting, and I'm so grateful for the stories in it that opened my eyes to the courage, dedication, strength, and sacrifice these men and women possess to serve their communities. Inspiring, touching, heartbreaking, and at parts, even funny... I highly recommend this read - not just for a firefighter, an EMT, or anyone that knows one, but for everyone that doesn't. The people who perform these jobs risk their lives to protect ours. Their tales are a privilege to read.I learned about this book and purchased it online for free by signing up for notifications from onehundredfreebooks.com I highly recommend the site - it contains a wide ride of books and it's truly free!"
2,worked for a week,I bought this mainly for my PS3 and to switch between my directv but after a week it doesn't work with the PS3 anymore...oh well..
2,Shipping was slow,"Product is OK, it does the job but it took a couple of weeks to get here. I paid $7.95 for shipping for a $9.95 item with the hope that it would arrive within 3 days."
2,Very stronge,I tried this product and could not complete it due to it's stronge dose and ingredents. It made me fill mad and it reaise me heart rate.Anyone want to use it should be carefull.
4,a great up and down road trip album,This is a trippy album that really takes the listener on a ride. It features great guitar sounds and melodies and Doug's great way with words. Every song winds into another with blasts of surging guitars and moody temperamental breathers. Scott Plouf on drums is exceptional. A great record.
4,Good epic rock songs,"I've lost this CD a while back, but I bought it here so might as well review it :P Some great work from this band, although I've read that it isn't reflective of their usual work. Long, intricate songs that seem to inhabit your mind. My personal favorites are ""Randy Described Eternity,"" with its slow build-up, and the darkness of ""I Would Hurt a Fly,"" a strangely sinister song to come from a guy with such a usually warm voice. Proof that they were capable of varying moods to a wide degree. Though it's been a while since I've listened last, I still remember it being a fairly good record. ""Keep It Like a Secret,"" to me however, seemed a little more concise and better-flowing."
4,This is Music,"Perfect From Now On was hard for me to get through at first, but after each listen I grew to love it, and it is now one of my favorite albums.I say to the person who just bought this album, or is even considering this album, to have patience."
4,One of BTS' best...,"I don't know if this is referred to as a ""theme"" album, but I dont think it would be a misnomer. The songs on this album are long and expansive. They range over tempo changes, catchy lyrics, and good guitar work. Built to Spill is a chord driven group, they seem to believe in the connectedness of the song, which makes songs depend on bold chord selection. The songs borrow from each other, and seem to move in and out of shared themes. Martsch exploits tempo changes well and brings the listener into the music as he subtly attaches us emotionally the musical movement. This in and of itself makes this a fantastic album. It's redundancy makes it an album you listen to non-stop for a month and then not again for 6 months when you listen fanatically again..."
4,Perfectly Unique Sound,"From the first notes of ""Randy Describes Eternity"", you know you're on to something new. Some of the best song lyrics and most creative guitar work I've heard.This album melds DIY, prog-rock, and symphonic ideas into a truly haunting, evocative, and memorable work. Imagine if Yes or King Crimson dropped the pretention and Dungeons and Dragons crap and had soul, emotion, and songwriting talent. Imagine if Nirvana or Pearl Jam were more cerebral.This is the ultimate soundtrack for driving through the desert at 3 a.m. A definite keeper."
2,"ok, once",I recently purchased this cd because of reviews on amazon and I'am really glad that I got it for 5 dollars because I would be very upset if I would have spent anymore it is worth one listen for something different but I won't be reaching for it anytime soon nothing at all like modest mouse like the one reveiew said the one reveiew got it really good just boring and just drags it isn't so bad that you take it out just not worth a second listen.
5,Son loves this set very durable,"Looked around for a non flower/pretty and this one met that need.Son loves this set and most certainly appreciates the non ""pretty design of this item"" Corelle is a great brand and generally can last a long time if treated well.Thanks amazon. I hope you get this design back in."
4,Where is the DVD?,ALL I'm going to say about part II is I think it has better plot then the first one and I'd like to see it released on DVD!!!
3,"AWFUL,IN A GOOD WAY","First thing first,this movie has horrible acting and the story is kinda of silly.But it is so creative and the special affects are halfway decent.But the first one was better.There is no Sandy Dennis or Stephen Gefforeys in this movie but it still lacks a awful but good movie."
2,976-Evil 2: The Astral Factor,"The majority of the plot deals with pretty coed Robin (Debbie James), who learns that her dean, Prof. Grubeck (Rene Assa), is a sorority girl murderer who has made a deal with the devil. In exchange for his soul, Grubeck can project his rotting ghost to kill. Leather bound bad boy, Spike (Patrick O'Bryan), joins forces with Robin who has developed a psychic link with the maniac.Not a really horrible flick, but not really that good either. The make up effects are crude, the acting is a bit rough, and the ending is a disappointing attempt at a twist. Some of the scenes are real gems though, including one in which one of Robin's friends (Leslie Ryan) is watching It's a Wonderful Life on TV. Grubeck pops up on a commercial, sucks her into the movie, and combines it with Night of the Living Dead."
3,Slight Improvement Over First 976-Evil,"976-Evil 2 is a sequel that is a little better than the original. It's not great, but it has it's cool moments. My favorite was when the woman was driving her car, and all of a sudden her brakes won't work and her car starts ramming into other cars. Jim Wynorski, b-movie extraordinare, directed this one. He has the ability to make a low-budget movie look like a big-budget movie. 976-Evil 2 is no exception, looking great with some decent special effects. Both Brigette Nielson and Buck Flower have small roles. 976-Evil is worth checking out if you're a fan of the first one, or of the Nightmare on Elm Street series. And you can own it, if you buy the recent 8 pack horror collection, that just came out courtesy of Lions Gate."
2,The O-riginal Astral Projection Movie,"Robin's Dean at her Community College, Mr. Grubeck, is the Slate River serial killer. The police catch him, but he uses ""astral projection"" to escape jail and kill some more. He wants Robin to be his mate IN HELL. Not if Spike Jones (?!) and his leather jacket and motorcycle and goofy noises can help it. At one point, I thought I was watching The Blues Brothers with all the car wrecks. Speaking of car wrecks, yeah, this wasn't very good."
2,Just when you thought it was safe to answer the phone...,"I saw this movie because I loved the first one so much, in fact the original ranks among my top 15 of all time. But this one is a real turkey. Sure, Patrick O'Bryan reprises his role as Spike, but there's no Suzie! There isn't the comedic relief of Hoax Wilmoth!!!The plot wasn't very good. The ending was AWFUL! The BIGGEST question this film raised for me, was ""where's the woman's voice on the phone?!"" You know what I'm talking about...""Out of the darkness and into the light comes your horrorscope on this dark and stormy night."" Well, she's been replaced by some dude who tries waaay too hard to be scary.This one was really disappointing. Definitely BUY the first one, but RENT this one, or just wait until it comes on TV.Grade: D+"
1,976-Evil? What will happen next? 1-800-Horror?,"This is a cheap rip off of A Nightmare On Elm Street, when a man goes to sleep, his soul/spirit comes out of him and he kills teenagers. Not a good movie, it's kind of stupid with a dumb ending."
1,Don't waste your money,"The photos they keep using over and over again don't match up with what they are speaking of.Granted they are pictures from her life but they use them so randomly.If you want a good over view of Jane Austen's times get ""Jane Austen's world"" by Maggie Lane.Don't even bother with this tape it is of no value!"
1,What happened to Mike Ness?,"I should start out with a confession. I love Social Distortion's previous work and was really excited to buy the dvd. Boy, was I let down quickly. Mike Ness seemed really stoned or really tired. Either way it dosen't matter, the energy that oozes from their 1998 live cd is missing in action on this dvd. The band's poor performance can only be eclipsed by the horrendous video production. The lighting is non-existant and the cheesy ""film scratch"" effect is used to cover miserable camera work. I can only hope that Mike Ness finds the inner strength to return to brilliance of his solo project ""Cheating at Solitaire"" and does another properly lit and shot dvd that serves the band some justice. Don't buy this disc, get some of their other work that shows the band firing on all 8 cylinders. Two thumbs down for ""Dead in Orange County""."
2,Are we watching the same DVD?,"I have seen SD eight times and really like the band alot. But this DVD sucks. The fake lines trying to make this thing look old are annoying. If it wasnt for that this video would get a better rating. Who ever ruined this should be fired. If you want to see how a DVD should be produced/shot, check out the Blasters DVD."
4,A great live DVD for any punk fan,come on can you get an better than social d i mean mike singing charlie banging on drums johnny on guitar and john on bass a great live set my only problem was that is wasn't long enough. but still a great dvd.mike's commentary between some songs is hilarious and the extra scenes are great about his car and there is an acoustic version on bad luck is great even though the sounds quality on the acoustic isn't great its still good to see them go acoustic.the songs are great all you favorite hits but they needed more hits on there some of my favorite songs weren't there but it is still must for any social d fan.the sound is great camera angles jump a little to much but stilla great liv dvd so a must buy for punks everywhere
5,Classic Social D Live!,Social D rock the show at house of blues. Some cool extras with Mike Ness. I say it's a classic live DVD by social distortion.
1,Tone Deaf,"First time I seen them (Long Beach'85) he was whining about how they were a 'rock n roll' band and not a punk band and the last time I seen them (Fullerton AA/NA meeting hall) he was whining about the people in the parking lot.And I quote '(I wish I could spell out that noise girls make when they are disgusted) ""What kind of people knowingly come to an Narcotics Anonymous meeting and drink beer and smoke weed in the parking lot.""Me and my friends were laughing looking around to see who he was talking about, and it only took me 2 minutes to realize he was talking about us. Which made us laugh even harder we laughed our buzz off."
5,My Granddaughter LOVED this---and FAST SHIPPING!,This is a great buy and looked wonderful in her room. My granddaughter wanted this for her birthday and she loves it. They shipped fast and made her very happy!! Thanks!
2,"You need to first read part one, ""To the Sun?""","As with another reviewer, nostalgic recollection of the great Classics Illustrated Comic version of Off on a Comet prompted me to get the original from the library. Alas, Off on a Comet begins at a point near the end of the Classics Comics plot. Turns out all the good parts are in part one of Hector Servadac, called To the Sun. The library found me a volume called ""The Space Novels of Jules Verne"" (Dover publications, 1960) which contains both To the Sun? and Off on a Comet. Sometimes these are called Hector Servadac: Part One and Hector Servadac: Part Two, respectively."
3,Space Travel over a century ago!,"I really like reading the classics. They are called classics for a reason. I especially enjoy authors like Jules Verne, who had quite an imagination! One thing that is fun to do is compare his imaginative ideas with what we know today. For instance, this book is about traveling through our solar system on a comet. Of course we know much more about the solar system today, but it is fun to see how much more we know compared to a century ago. However, this book got pretty technical at times, talking about planet distances from the sun, time it would take to travel those distances in space, figuring out mass, diameter, etc. of the comet, all in great detail, and much of it was tedious and wrong. Having said that, I still enjoy how he writes. His characters have quite an adventure, and it was fun to go along for the ride!"
3,Off on a Comet! a Journey through Planetary Space,Hadn't read this since Jr. high school and thats been over 40 years. Even with all the things that have happened in the space program plus all the other new deep space discoveries this still is a good read if you like the old sci fi or just like Verne. It reminds us how far we have come and how far we still need to go.
3,A lesser-known work by Jules Verne,"Lesser-known, and with good reason. It starts with a comet no one noticed smacking a big old piece off the earth. This big old piece has a few competing military units on it, none of whom notice the contact. (Your ""bad physics"" meter should already have pegged, given only that much.)The remainder, up until some more bad physics at the end, explores some fairly brutal stereotypes of Verne's era. Bizarrely motivated scientist, innately superior British, some French in denial about British superiority, lazy Mediterraneans, and powerful Russians with motives only dumly exposed to reason - they're all there. Plus some fairly vicious stereotypes about Jews.On the whole missing this will be a great gift to yourself, unless you want to remind yourself just how far we've come.-- wiredweird"
3,The virtues of therapeutic touch!,"Can you accept Einsteins paradigm, of the existence of a Life energy flowing through and around all of us. Well this is the concept that therapeutic touch on the whole is based on. Well, here are lessons that teaches you how to believe in this power within yourself, and how to utilize it to heal yourself and others.I found this book quite informative, and the self-knowledge tests were very useful, especially to the skeptic in all of us. Laying of hands is a wonderful way to explore our own powers and this book is an excellent choice to aid us in this journey."
5,Unbelievable book!,"This is a great book! It will tell you exactly what to do to make the most annoying website on the net! It can make you make unstopable pop-ups, changing backgrounds, forcing readers to scroll over to read a sentence, blast annoying music in the background, make visitors view a slide-show before entering your page, and that's just for beginners! Not only does this book tell you how to be annoying, it has some nice things to help your site, like making sure visitors read the terms of service before entering, and so on. After each section, it tells you how to use the scripts to Not be annoying, so you don't always have to annoy the people.Any way, this is a great book for people who LOVE to create off-the-wall webpages!"
3,"A little awkward, but still helpful.","I suffer from chronic myofascial trigger point issues as well as fibromyalgia, so I bought this tool as a travel and/or studio aid for when I can't access my Back Buddy or Accumassage tools. I'd say it works okay, but its not quite as helpful as the other two. Good for emergency relief of pain, but not an overall solution. The back scratcher end works great. I prefer rounded ends like on my other tools, which are easier on delicate fibromyalgia aches than this pointed one. Still, for travel it does it job when things get rough. I'm considering getting another Accumassage for the art studio for when my arms/back or neck cramp up. The two together probably will meet my pain relief needs."
2,Feels flimpsy,"It's good if you take it on trips and use it on the plane. Otherwise, it's flimpsy. Buy the longer wood one instead, that's a lot more effective."
2,Spanx trauma,"Loved the way they smoothed your body, but after 3 hours of dancing both heels ripped out! For the price I expected to wear them more than once."
1,Do not waste your $$,"I must admit I had read reviews that warned me about the top band rolling down. I also read that you have to get the right size to prevent this. So I made sure I got the right size by checking the size chart at the onehotmama's web site ([...]) that one of the reviewers recommended. I ordered two to give them a try. The pantyhose fits well though no different that other pantyhoses I have bought at a fraction of the price elsewhere. The high waist band rolls down the moment you put them on and there is no way to make it stay put. The spandex is very good, so good that as it rolls down it pushes your flesh in and it shows as if you have an extra roll of fat above the waist. Worse than the bra roll, let me tell you, and very uncomfortable. I must admit that I have not been able to wear them outside a single time. I bought two, spent more than $50 and they have been sitting for months in the drawer."
2,Be prepared for a fight to get it on,"It was definitely a struggle trying to pull these up, and once it was on, I found the waistband stiff and pretty uncomfortable. I suppose I should have read the description better as I was looking for more opaque tights. I had purchased Spanx ""tight-end"" tights before and those were a lot softer and more comfortable around the waist. These pantyhose just weren't for me."
2,"Only for the ""beginner"" dog owner","I have had dogs for years, and this book doesn't cover anything I didn't already know. I'm not an expert, but everything in the book was pretty basic. It is a good book for a person who is just a dog owner for the first time. It has lots of little tid bits, but no meat and potatoes."
1,died after 18 months,"for no reason we can identify the video aspect of this display just died and flickers back and forth between red/blue/green/white/black. It was not dropped, there was no power surge, and it was very carefully handled. Just took it off the base to wall mount it and now dead. Would not buy another one."
5,Fusion plus Tradition,"So many of my childhood favorites are in this book, which I thought could only be bought and never made by me. Having been to her restaurant several times and college in Philadelphia, I was given her cook book as a present. Being known for fusion cooking, due to her culinary training, I was so suprised at how many traditional chinese recipes are in her book like marbled tea eggs, hot and sour soup, dumplings, various pancakes and really good instructions and diagrams on how to roll the dough, wrap the dumplings, etc. Hats off to Susanna Foo for compiling such a good cook book with interesting antedotes regarding how the various foods invoke her childhood memories, making it an interesting read as well."
4,so cute,"This show is adorable and hilarious to boot. I love the physical comedy - still so effective in such a simple style of animation. There are a lot of funny little touches, usually related to the characters; Santa Claus lives in the ninja village, there's one kid who's always showing off like Bruce Lee and ripping his shirt off. I have a pretty well cultivated sense of humor (or so I'd like to think) and this show made me laugh consistently. It's really cute and I'd recommend it to anyone who's a fan of animated shorts, be they children or not."
4,"Good for beginner , but a bit unorganized for me","Hi,I am working in IT Securiy field , and was a fan of this book's first edition. He also did a great job for second edition.I was about to conduct a internal training class (Basic ITSec.) for my IT colleagues here and use his 2nd edition as primary source material.I have found no typo nor technical error in this book and the only negative point for me is that the ""Hacker Techniques"" & ""Type of attack "" chapters comes too early as they should appear after CIAA was disscused. Maybe this is the author's style to make this book more colorful but I personally think make learning experience in ITSEc. a little deviate.Still , this book is worth buying."
5,Sorbo delivers another great performance!,"After his solid performance in Avenging Angel,I wasn't sure what to expect from Kevin Sorbo in Prairie Fever. He didn't disappoint. Here he plays a down and out ex-sheriff,driven to the bottle by grief & guilt after losing his wife in a bank heist gone awry. He gets a chance at redemption when he agrees to transport three women,all suffering from prairie fever,back to civilization. Along with sharpshooter Olivia,who he first saw in the Clearwater saloon,he battles not only the desert,but two guys he put in prison years earlier and the husband of one of the women he's been paid to transport. Also on their trail is Olivia's partner,Monte,played superbly by Lance Henrickson. It all makes for one heck of an adventure. Included in the dvd are two interesting interviews,one with Kevin Sorbo and the other with Henrickson. If you love westerns,you should definitely add this one to your collection!"
4,Prairie Fever,I am sorry for the delay. I thought I had given a review of this item. If not I found it to be a good item. It was on time and in good shape. I certainly would order from this seller again whenever that seller has an item that I am interested in having. Thanks again for the excellent service and product.
4,Andrew Smith Tarantulas of the US & Mexico,"Before this book was published there was absolutely nothing on these spiders outside of the original historical literature. Now we have a book, which for the first times gives you the opportunity to identify these fascinating spiders. Andrew Smith has, with mixed success, tried to develop an illustrated key system linked to State maps, which does make it considerably easier to find out the name of your spider. There are faults with this approach but nobody has done a better job on this group. Overall an invaluable book."
5,Great book to read !!! What a Miracle !!!,"I have started to read this book, and it gives a very important insight of ourselves and how all of us (Mankind) are a very Precious, Precious as individuals. The Choice is ours to improve and perform our own miracles. God is with us in all we do and he is stiill with us. Proclaim your Rarity !!! ......i would recommend this as one of the first readings for Og Mandino's other Great books.. Enjoy!!!!"
2,She should be heard and not seen,"Dolores keane is one of the finest singers of Irish music and this video is no different in that regard. It is at least 4 stars on that basis. However this video is one of the worst I have ever seen. It is like it was done by a group of first semester film student, who flunked, and thrown out of the program. It is bad, and I sat through ""Tank Girl"" and ""Battlefield Earth"". Also Dolores Keane has no stage or visual presence and should be heard and not seen. Unless she does better in the visual presence she will be surpassed by the new girls on the block, Cathie Ryan and Karen Casey. Only heaven can help her if Nanci Griffith does an Irish song album. I wish she would."
3,Better for little kids,"If your child is a fan of Mark Twain's then this book would be interesting to read together. It is written in the voice of a very young girl in a very old fashioned style, using words like ""gay"" and ""cross,"" in the way of the pre-1930's. If however, you are looking for a book of Mark Twain's life experiences written from an adult's perspective, this is not it."
3,"Microeconomic Theory or an unreadable ""Bible""?","I do not mind mathematics in order to gain more insight into economic theory but it cannot be used at the expense of economic intuition.I do not believe that Mas Colell's book has improved my knowledge of microeconomics beyond the level of Varian's intermediate textbook.I now recall the following refrain: ""To find a name for learning when other streets are barred, find something very easy and make it very hard...""Not useful for a busy ""student""."
1,this book sucks,The authors of this book have the ability to make even the easy concepts seem very hard. The notations used in this book are awful and it takes more time to understand the notations than to understand the concepts.
2,You'd better be a mathematician...,"Put it this way: my Dad opening the book, thinking that it might be interesting, and said, ""Yaaahh!!"", not in ectasy but in agony. There's more notation in the book than words. It's terse. It's huge, and it's scary. I really hate this book. It gets worse as you go farther along. (Otherwise) simple concepts are made a mystery by the tricky wording and endless proofs. I'm sure that the trio made a lot of money off the book, yet another example of those who know that they can profit from the misery of others. JERRY TOOK THE FALL!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"great after you learn it, but a steep learning curve!",We were told there would be no math. They lied!
2,Ugh!,"We are using this book for my Ph.D.-level microeconomics class, which happens to be taught by one of the authors of the book. I have been struggling with the text for two months now, and find it more and more frustrating at every turn. I think this book spends far too much time turning simple economic concepts into arcane mathematical formulae without nearly enough attention to drawing out the important economic issues behind the math. I've had econ classes before. I know there are issues out there, and that economics is not just math, but you would never know it from this book!"
5,The way a textbook should be.,"After years of the poor, imprecise and bad written Varian's Microeconomic Analysis, the serious reader has an opportunity to have a book that is rigorous, well written, clear, and complete. Of course, a book like this requires some math foundations."
3,There are better textboooks out there,"This tome was recommended to me in my first year of graduate school at Oxford. It is a great reference, and learning from it will give you a solid foundation in microeconomics. However, the product is vastly overrated and there are superior textbooks. MWG's writing style is also boring.The sections on game theory were particularly disappointing. To supplement them, I would suggest Herb Gintis' ""Game Theory: Evolving"" (Second Edition), or perhaps even Tirole.In short, purchase this book if you're an economics graduate student, but don't make it your primary resource."
5,Why are people so scared of math ?,"Yes, there is a lot of math in Mas-Collel's book. so what ? Math is a language that everyone should be able to understand. If you dont like the book, that's ok. But be sure you understood all the book before writing a review."
2,This isn't Physics!,"This book is certainly complete, and it is a solid reference. However, there are sections where it seems the authors take great pleasure in making relatively simple concepts much more confusing than they need to be. Bland, boring writing, and atrocious lay-out make it painful to read at times. I can see how some people might like this book....people I have ZERO in common with. Burrying the beautiful intuition of economics under a pile of cumbersome notation isn't helping anyone."
2,"Rich Mathematics, No Insight.","I personally consider this book inaccessible to those who do not equip with sufficient knowledge in mathematics. You can easily find that this book covers no further insight at all than Intermediate Microeconomics by Varain, but transforms intuitive concepts into incomprehensible mathematical equations. If you're not interested in becoming a PhD in Economics, simply forget this book."
3,it's like the bible - in the original Greek,"Currently we are suffering through the endless notation and mind-blowing exercises in ""elementary math"" (yeah, right!)that comprise the chapters of MWG. To be fair, MWG does indeed give a complete overview of microeconomic theory. However, if you had an insufficient background in math (aka less than a Master's degree) it can be difficult (more truthfully: impossible) to pull out the intuitive concepts from the overwhelmingly mathy definitions. You will definately need a (more than) competent instructor to lead you through the quagmire that is MWG."
2,Full of Math !!!!,"You need to have a strong mathematical background in order to understand it. Sadly enough the book relies too much in math misplacing along the way the true nature of Microeconomics which is the main reason ( perhaps the only one) why we bought this book. What would you expect, anyhow, from an economics book written by a group of mathematicians ???"
3,It's too darned big,"Whether you use this or Varian...you will still need to have a competent instructor. The book is too big and murky for a graduate student to wade through on his own and much of the bulk of the book is unusable in a typical first-year micro course. Game theory is better dealt with via Tirole or a specialized treatment.Certainly, you could spend an entire summer doing nothing but trying to work your way through the entire book. You could also read all of Judge, et al, or you could read all of Blanchard and Fisher...but you could have done 100 things more useful in becoming a good economist an a successful graduate student.Now that I have finished the program, when I need a definition or an explanation, I almost always reach for Varian. MWC gathers dust."
3,It gets better the more you read it.,"When I started out with this book I hated it. Well, its still a pain, but the longer you study this book the more sense it makes, and the more you understand why they NEED to use all the notation. Modern micro gets very abstract, and we all need to learn all of that. Only when you go back over the text after your first year do you realize how well this book is written. There are some problems with the text, though: (i)too many interesting points are left as exercises, (ii)examples are not fleshout out enough, and (iii) they often try to ""explain"" a concept by using ONLY the math. Using both math and English would be better."
3,If you are a Economics PhD student this book is good to have.,"My professors at NC State recommended this book. I generally don't like to use it because it's so big, but if I need more information on a topic its my go to book. It's very detailed and has most everything an economics PhD student needs to read."
3,terrific but difficult to understand!!!!,"First of all, I know that understanding this book completly make me have a wonderful insight about economics as well as building block in analyzing overall economic field. But details in this book make me wonder whether these exhaustive analysis which heavily depends on mathematics is necessary condition of understanding economics. I wish authors to write book in easy style for students who wanna study alone."
2,Too dificult,I've read this book and i find it too dificult to understand it although i study applied economics
1,A lot of crap,"Want to look cool telling everybody how you understood the maths behind this? But you didn't understand the concepts, you didn't understand the ideology behind the book, you think you know microeconomics but you don't really understand it. Try Bernard Guerrien or Sophie Jallais, try to really understand microeconomics without this pseudoscientific crap."
4,Very informative and to the point...Absolute facts,"The sister to WW2 the complete history dvd set, this documentary on the pacific theatre is very true to it's time..Even to go as far as unedited from it's original release..It explains the war from start to finish, giving straight facts backed up with original pictures..It is completely an information dictionary on WW2 giving the facts while not spending too long on any one topic...The long length of this documentary makes it worth having for the price..Though at times it does show you the politics and the processes of the war at rather drawn out lengths to explain everything that happened including battle strategy and fleet movements...For this reason only, I give it a 4 out of 5"
4,Physical Chemistry of Surfaces/Adamson,"El texto en si mismo es bastante complejo,pero es posible acceder al conocimiento impreso en él a través de las referencias. Plantea el desafío de ir más allá de lo que el mismo autor plantea. Es recomendable el texto para gente con espíritu de elevación y superación, y para quienes realmente quieran emprender el viaje hacia las interfases moleculares de la nanotecnología."
1,Received With Different Colored Chain And No Way To Attach Chain,"The illustration in the listing shows a bright silver chain, but I received a gold colored one, plus there was no link (also pictured) to connect the chain to the pendant. Rather than send it back, I'll purchase a link locally. Very disappointed in both the the product and Amazon.com for selling it."
3,childish,"Some good ideas- very short lasting group activities. Childish worksheets included, seem more appropriate for developmentally delayed than older adults. Most adults cognitively impaired enough for these to be appropriate for would not be able to write or offended by coloring."
3,Good starting point.,"I agree with some of the other reviewers. This book provides good jumping-off points for group discussions. But all of that info could fit into a few pages containing plain lists of topics. The worksheets are much too childish, even for my lower functioning patients."
3,just ok,"first books i've gotten from this series. My 3 year old is a big hockey fan. I was expecting a lot given the endorsements. I book is small and flimsy. In the two books I got the beginning of the story is repeated. The books are cute, but did not live up to my expectations. I'm glad I didn't pay the insane shipping rates that some of the other books in the series required."
5,This is amazing!,This recording is one of Kna's finest. One just has to look at the stellar cast list to realize that this recording is worth the price. The highlight must be J. Grendl's beautiful and expressive reading of Gurnemanz. Vinay is the perfect Parsifal with all his Chilean zeal. Kna's reading is more mature here than on earlier recordings and the sound is perfectly acceptably. This is well worth the price and one of Bayreut's many timeless treasures.
4,Marred by Greindl's gravelly Gurnemanz,"I enjoyed this recording of another of Kna's summer Bayreuth Parsifals. I would warn fellow Wagnerians of the presence of Josef Greindl as Gurnemanz--hardly a cantabile performance. It's been my experience that the quality of a Parsifal performance stands or falls on the ability of the singer cast in that role.So, this is fine recording--but not the best; I think Kna's 1951, 1963, or 1964 editions are better. I prefer Karajan's studio rendition on DG as the best."
3,note to pcornelius,"you say people who have intellegence shouldnt bother with such books. maybe you should have started with the biology for idiots before you moved on to gegntics. cells have cell walls and plasma membranes to held everyhting in. there are no sides, top, bottom. they are spherical, round, 3-d like the earth (except plants which are more like boxes)."
3,good movie,"This movie is originally titled Secret Rivals, good movie mainly due to the presence of Hwang Jang Lee, the two good guys Wong Tao and John Liu I don't like that well, which is why it didn't get a five, they could have picked two better heroes, this movie would have been great. Not much of a plot except good guys teaming up to whip the bad guy."
4,like beer,"Truly an acquired taste, but well worth the second sip. Farrar's voice may be a barrier to some less open-minded persons, but it is intoxicating after several listens. Caryatid and Left a Slide are beautiful songs and the rest are good also. Worth a buy if you like the Jayhawks or Sister Hazel. Be warned if prone to depression, some of these songs are not going to help!"
5,"An elegant album for reflections on a long, hard road.","Son Volt continues to be the band most in tune with the American sense of place and, conversely, transience. This record follows Trace beautifully, lending retrospective grace to the scenic tapestry of its predecessor. From the fading light of day seen beyond a familar front porch reached at long last, this record is a distillation -- the memories that remain when the only view of a world outside is in the mind. Eloquent, absorbing, brilliant."
5,Do your frontal lobes need a good scrubing?,"I listen to this album when I'm doing a road trip like when I'm going up Highway 395 along the eastern Sierra Nevada. It's also good for clearing out the cobwebs in your brain as you're about to jump off the cornice at Mammoth.But seriously, Son Volt and Jay Ferrar have many fans and I'm one. However, I think that this particular album is their best work. The words are haunting and the melodies, guitars and rhythms are driven."
4,Solid Album,"This album gets a bad rap but for really no good reason. It's got great tunes and matches right up there with Trace and Wide Swing Tremolo. A lot of the acoustic numbers, Creosote, Left a Slide, Last Minute Shakedown, and No More Parades are probably even better than the ones on the other two albums. This album is more laid back than Trace, but is has more depth and I find myself playing it more than the first cd."
4,Solid CD from Son Volt in their prime,"Straightaways is a pure, honest blend of great songs: starting with alternative, melodic barroom stompers, it shifts midway, as style and tone decelerate to dusty, acoustic/alt country ballads, lead by Jay Farrar's baritone, guttural voice. Son Volt's stylistic comparisons to Neil Young's early recordings are understood and warranted, with buzzing, jangly guitars and pedal steel in the background. Lyrics are typically moody and full of angst - loneliness and alienation - all of which are common themes for Farrar. Son Volt's early work is exceptional and worth exploring. GENRES: Alternative, Alt Country, Mellow Rock, Rock.BUY IF YOU LIKE: The Jayhawks, Neil Young, Uncle Tupelo.MUST HEAR TRACKS: ""Caryatid Easy,"" ""Creosote,"" ""Cemetery Savior."""
5,well worth it!,great cd! we like all the songs! all of Son Volts cd's have proven to be worth the money!!
2,Disappointment,The fabulous Trace or the equally compelling Wide Swing Tremolo are better buys. I really like Caryatid Easy but the rest of the CD lags. I love Son Volt but I don't love this CD.
3,The sophomore slump,"After the uniformly excellent ""Trace,"" the similar sounding but somewhat bland ""Straightaways"" is a disappointment. The biggest problem is in the songwriting, which is far below the high standards set by the debut album. I guess band leader Jay Farrar just didn't have enough time to come up with new gems like the debut's ""Windfall,"" and ""Tear Stained Eye."" Fortunately, Son Volt's third album, ""Wide Swing Tremolo"" returns them to the the glory of ""Trace."" Buy it instead if you haven't already."
3,a new genre! vanilla country,"i didn't want to believe the naysayers, but it's true: son volt really only had one good album, trace, which was brilliant, one of the defining pillars of alt.country. this came immediately afterward, and dude, it's bland. everything that was so pure and simple and wise on their debut is already tired out and bedridden here. there are very few standout tracks--maybe none--and though everything is in the right place, and there's nothing really offensive or embarrassing, you've got to wonder what happened. they did get a little better on the third record, but i'm glad farrar jumped ship when he did. his solo stuff blows this away."
3,Unique view,"I liked reading this book and think it has many valid points. I do not have the same beliefs, but still appreciate the basics of his point. I believe many of the points on what we should and should not be eating are great recommendations and try to follow many of them."
2,save your money,"Please, send your money to a more worth while cause. This book was 118 pages of the same messages over and over and over and over...... Allow me to sum it up for you: Lesson 1: Don't eat pork; Lesson 2: Only eat 1x every 24-72 hours; Lesson 3: White people are your enemy; Lesson 4: Only eat what I say to eat;These lessons are repeated on practically EVERY single page! Don't believe me? Waste your money and see for yourself. And by the way, if a person could actually live to be hundreds of years old by following the methods in this book, then why did E. Muhammad die at the age of 78?Yes, this man is worthy of respect...but the book is not."
3,Great read,"Great read, very, very informative. I scored this book three stars only because of its repetition. I strongly recommend this book."
5,An extremely impressive debut,I keep this one in constant rotation since I heard it a few years ago. The music is lyrical and engaging and each of the three musicians are outstanding. Kallor's shares the harmonic language of Fred Hersch and Brad Mehldau with a voice all his own. Much reward from repeated listens. A highly recommended piano trio album.
5,My dog loves her new bed. I ordered 2 but they only had one. They no longer makes them. Too bad.,Great! Dogs love it. Too bad that they discontinued. Nice thick well made product. The design is very nice too
2,A Great Woman Deserves a Better Bio,"Rarely have I read a biography where the author is so disdainful of his subject. Sexist and tone deaf to the life of this extraordinary woman, this book is full of name dropping but bereft of insight. What's more, Gill's coverage of Peggy during WWII consists of little more than how she strategized to get her paintings out of Italy for the duration. One imagines that the activities of the Nazis would be a core concern, yet they're completely ignored in this dull and plodding tome."
4,"Fun, but a third person voice","Peggy's story is definitely a fun read, if not a fun life in itself. It reminds us of how secondary money can be to finding true love. She was the product of a wild time in history and this book, while well-written, makes me want to read her story in her own hand. A good ""map to the stars"" if you're interested in some gossip on the artists of the period. I paid next to nothing for the book - if I had paid full price, I might have felt a little less satisfied."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"After anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book, it was so disappointing to realize that I was forcing myself to read it! The book reads like a term paper with so many quotes from PG's own book that I was wondering why I had not bought that one instead. Several friends have also attempted to read this book and just can't get past the first half. You have to be dedicated and determined to get through this one!"
2,The Battle Was Won Quickly,"My son is eight years old and doesn't play too many games, so I wouldn't say he's a game wiz or anything. However, in just two days he had beaten the entire game. We were sure that he missed something or skipped something, but he hadn't. He just beat it quickly.He had fun, but for the cost, you'd think they'd be able to create something a little more challenging."
4,Better than the the First,"Our son loves this game.I guess the freedom to mix and match heads, bodies and abilities or powers gives the game much more appeal in his eyes.Others have given this game a much poorer review but this kid gives it a thumbs up!!think for yourself!"
4,pretty good,"i thought this game was pretty good, and the fights wer good. the only thing i don't like about this game, is because it's to short! that is all"
3,lego star wars 2 gba review,"its an ok game but one the levels is just really laggy, so laggy that i dont even want to replay that level ever again and plus it takes so long to get enough studs to buy something you want for example boba fett costs 150 studs i mean that doesn't sound like alot but trust me to get that many studs it'll take longer than a month to get that many studs and plus the mini scenes have horible graphics"
1,Customer service completely drops the ball,"I have spent collectively 3 hours, perhaps more, trying to reach customer service and I can't get anyone. This is the WORST customer experience I have experienced at any point in the last ten years. I won't be buying an Onkyo product again. What is the point of making a decent product if no one from the company will bother dealing with the inevitable problems that arise? Onkyo needs to rethink how it does business."
1,Alas,"The book is attractive and easy to read. Unfortunately, however, I found factual errors, enough to undermine my confidence in the overall scholarship. Find another book if you want reliable information."
3,Too Much Emphasis on Job Descriptions...,"Lachlann and Eva could have been very interesting, and the overall plot wasn't too bad, but for heaven's sake, I want dialogue between a hero and heroine that tells a story, not a line or two thrown in just to remind us that there ARE characters in this book, while the author relates page after page ...after page, of smithy work. I appreciate her knowledge of the craft, but I didn't like it as the focal point for the ENTIRE book. This was much more about smithy work than a love story."
4,Just what the doctor ordered!,"A charming and engaging tale of true love between childhood friends. A magical faery legend interwoven into a fairly simple, but not weak, plot. A pretty, brave heroine, a sexy handsome hero. What more could you ask for? An enjoyable romantic story that I read in one day. I can't wait to read Swan Maiden and Stone Maiden. This book was just what I needed to brighten up a rainy day. Also recommended: Sandra Hill's The Last Viking, Outlaw Viking, and Christine Feehan's Dark Prince."
2,"Good beginning, regular story, bad ending","The beginning of the book is good, so it hooked you to continue, but the rest of the story is boring and guess what, at the end they get married, come on, you can't write that way a book, if you really want to read an excellent love story with an enchanted sword read Until Forever by Johanna Lindsey and you will see the difference between two girls that had a sword and a story to tell."
5,Rodney Crowell produces another gem!,"This album is incredible!! Rodney and Vince have incredible voices and the songwriting is superb. ""When Losers Rule The World"" is the best song I've heard in a long, long time. Also love ""Tobacco Road"", ""Nothing"", and ""Nobody's Gonna Tear My Playhouse Down"". Recommend picking this album up while it's still available!!!"
5,One of my all-time favorite cds.,"If the Beatles were still together today, what kind of cd would they be making? That was the intent of the Cicadas (note the ""bug"" reference, ie ""beetles"" - cicadas are regular visitors in Nashville where these musicians play). This record accomplished that and more. You can hear Beatles influences everywhere, including Lennon-style songs, McCartneyesque tunes and George Harrison's guitar influences.If you are a Beatles fan, this is a must-have. If you are not, this record stands on its own with superb musicianship, outstanding songwriting, great vocals and sonic superiority.You won't be disappointed except that there won't be a second Cicadas album to look forward to."
5,Incredible but true,"After a first reading of the Revelation of Ares, I almost immediately felt convinced that one of my innermost intuitions was right even though I didn't know how to formulate it straight away. Actually, I have a clearer picture about mankind's destiny; I do believe no one is doomed to live in misfortune, pain or worse, indifference; anybody is able to change for the supreme Good ? well that's how I mean it. God who manifests himself in this message seems a whole lot different from what I was told during my Sunday school sessions, like for the relationship between man and God. Still the overall impression is this revelation appears more surprisingly condusive than what I would have thought at first. It is presented as a stride to spiritual freedom and I do believe it is."
4,"Excellent, but many poor maps","This is an excellent guidebook. The only problem with it is the quality of the city maps, which are almost impossible to read. I saw an earlier edition in which they were in color and much better. They must have tried to save money in this edition by doing them in grayscale."
3,Abby's role is a little overdone,"*Review contains spoilers*This is the same story that has been done many times before, with the babysitter trying to take over the family. There is a slight plot twist at the end but it's nothing that makes the story great. From the beginning I thought Abby's character could have been done better. Right away she starts murdering people and seems to have no fear at all of getting caught or seen by someone. It is a little hard to believe that a person like her would be capable of killing so many people and getting away with it.Toward the end of the movie when she just starts making it obvious what she's doing, it makes the whole thing kind of pointless. Obviously if the husband knows that she pushed the wife down the stairs he will never willingly be with her, so what exactly is she trying to do? The story would have made more sense if she was trying to make it look like an accident and make the husband fall in love with her."
1,Good but doesn't match others in collection,This is a very nice soap dispnser but I bought it with the toothbrush holder from the same collection and the oil rub bronze finish is quite different between the 2. Moen said they can not guarrantee any items in the ORB finish will be similar and thats that. Really disappointed because now can not return to amazon as the return window has closed.
