5,A trip down memory lane,My brother was thrilled to recieve this Raiders video. He loves his sports.The seller was excellent . And the video was crisp and clear.
1,EASILY BURNS IN KETTLE,"I tried 1 batch of the caramel and even watching it the stuff scorched. I paid to much for my machine to let it get ruined by this stuff so I just tossed the whole case, unopened flavors and all. I will just stick with microwave caramel corn when I feel like that. Complete waste of my money and at Christmas time as well. It may work better in other conditions or larger machines. I have a 8oz machine and did not feel like taking the risk."
2,Not so good,This product looks like granulated sugar with koolaid mixed in. The burn temperature for the sugar is very low and you have less than one minute. I used this in an electric kettle. I waited for the oil to sizzle before adding and it browned and nearly burned. The recommendation is for 1/2 glaze to measure of corn. This did not come close to glazing most of the kernels. It does not have a strong flavor or coating. It also wasn't very pretty looking and I wouldn't make specialty popcorn as a gift with this.
4,NICE COLLECTION OF TIDBITS ABOUT GEORGE BRETT,"THIS IS A VERY NICE COLLECTION OF HIGHLIGHTS AND LOWLIGHTS CONCERNING THE CAREER OF SUPERSTAR GEORGE BRETT. IT HAS A NICE AMOUNT OF SHORT STORIES AND FACTS FOLLOWING HIS AMAZING CAREER FROM HIS FIRST YEAR IN THE MINORS TO HIS INDUCTION TO COOPERSTOWN. IT IS KINDA SHORT NOT HIGH ON DETAIL BUT HIGH ON CONTENT AND FACTS CONCERNING MR BRETT. I LIKED IT AND RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL BASEBALL FANS WHO MIGHT LIKE TO READ ABOUT THE PINE TAR INCIDENT, ALMOST HITTING FOR A 400 BATTING AVG, AND MANY OTHER FACTS IN HIS GREAT CAREER. WELL WORTH READING."
5,Informative and Interesting Read,"I was pleasantly surprised by Searching For El Dorado. I purchased the book to begin some background investigation into the entire history of El Dorado and wasn't expecting anything wonderful. However, the author has produced a very well-written book about his travels in Guyana and the gold mining industry. He executed a very respectable quantity of investigative reporting on the subject and intertwined it masterfully with his own travel experiences in a country few people know much about. It was both a fine adventure tale and very informative."
2,Sent it back-Charge lasted less than 2 Hrs.,This radio was supposed to play for about 18 hrs. on a full charge.It lasted only about 1 1/2 hrs. Tried to charge it again for over 24 hrs. with the same result. I returned it for a refund.
3,... too many buttons!!,"...too many buttons, I got it for the ear jack and the Digital read out. It worked fine the first time I set all the station buttons ...but after they changed TV from analog to digital ...(and I'm sure that has nothing to do with my dislike for this little monster) ...if it's on the headboard and in the dark of night, ...your old and can't see well anymore and the light goes out before you fix what it is that your trying to fix ... you'll have to push one of those little buttons again....it seems like all the station buttons have unset themselves. ....don't like it!"
2,It lasted for....,"The crank power lasted for two years, and the radio itself lasted for almost four years (almost).I opened this up after it broke, and it looks like someone let their child loose with a hot glue gun on the radio's circuit board.Fun times."
1,DOA when it arrived.,"Unfortunately, the radio would never hold a charge. Once it was taken off the wall charger, it would not even turn on. Can't give it a good review if it did not work."
2,Tuning ability was terrible,"I sent mine back the next day after getting it. With only an up/down scan button to find stations, it skipped over any station that wasn't putting out a 'super' signal. Maybe the crank and solar features would be good, but ""I"" prefer to be the one to select which stations I want to listen to...not the ""radio""."
1,Terrible electric stapler!,I had a different Swingline before that was wonderful...this one is either posessed or just plain awful. I keep coming into my office and finding staples that it has spit out all over my desk. It even does it when I am working at my desk????
2,Unreliable,"I got this stapler four months ago and have barely used it. Each time I have, it has jammed so badly that I have to unplug it and take it apart. Now it is throwing 3 or 4 staples at a time and jamming with the papers inside it. I am now ordering a heavier duty stapler, and I advise you to do the same if you need an electric version. A waste of money."
5,Workhorse,"I bought 5 of these in 2003 - 2004, they are still the favorites in the office, so much so they've slowly dissapeared and I'm down to 2. Unless the quality has gone down since my initial purchase, they shouldn't jam - ever. I'm buying a few additional ones and will update this review if the performance doesn't support my past experience."
4,Swingline Stapler,"I'm using the stapler evry day at work and it works just fine. This stapler is a replacement for the old Swingline stapler, which unfortunately died after about 3 years. Hopefully, this one will last as long, if not longer."
1,Piece of junk,"This is the worst piece of equipment I have ever bought. It has never successfully stapled anything. It jams and will not release. All I can say is ""Grrr."""
2,adjustable depth sensor poorly desiged,The stapler has a great depth of staplng but the design of the flimsey metal sensor stops working extremely fast.They also get stuck and won't release quite a bit.We have purchased 10 of these over time but I have to look for another option. If they redesigned the sensor it would be a great product.
1,Agreed - this IS a piece of junk!,"I've owned several electric staplers and this, by far, has been the worst. To say this has a 20-sheet capacity is a real stretch, as anything over 10 sheets was a challenge to staple with this. I was constantly clearing jams out of this thing, and when it did staple, the staples often wouldn't go all the way through and I'd be forced to bend the staple closed manually. I also had issues with the adjustable paper guide not staying in place and my sheets were often stapled much further down than I wanted.I just spent 30 minutes trying to staple seven sheets of paper and constantly clearing out jams, it is no longer working at all. It's now found a new home in my trash can while I search for another, much more reliable model. Swingline is usually reliable, but they really dropped the ball with this one."
4,Great!,"We were having a hard time finding replacement lights for our kitchen. Amazon to the rescue! These are perfect, and the price was reasonable."
2,Black and white version of a color movie,"I'm rating this version 2 stars, instead of 4 because the print is in black and white although the movie was filmed in color and is available that way on DVD. It's a good movie, not great, but good. The film is based on a play and is very much a showcase for Anna Neagle who gets to play 2 different characters (mother and daughter), but also as well as to reprise scenes from two of her biggest hit movies playing Nell Gwyn and Queen Victoria in dream sequences. For the Flynn fans, you will find a different Flynn than you are used to, he is a song and dance man here and functions as Anna Neagle's leading man rather than the real star of this picture. David Farrar is also featured and gives a pleasant performance as well. If you are not a fan of Ms. Neagle's, you will not care much for this film. If you are, you will enjoy it but I would strongly recommend you seek out the color versions available rather than this."
4,Insurance book,This is an excellent way to keep all the papers together in my car. I like the size and the way that it opens up so that you can see eveything without taking it out.
5,Waldman Speaks,"POTUS Speaks is such an intriguing look at the behind the scenes work done in the West Wing. Maybe this should be entitiled ""The Real West Wing"". Waldman takes the reader on a journey through the thought processes of one of the most brilliant presidents of the century. Whether you agree with his politics or not, the reader will certainly become aware of President Clinton's awesome ability to do things ""on the fly"".This is a real glimpse (I keep wanting to say behind the scenes, as that's really what this is) of what staffers and aides go through on a daily basis during an administration. A great read for all political junkies, no matter the party affiliation."
2,Just a regular mattress pad,My husband sweats a lot at night and I thought this would stop the problem. It didn't at all. It doesn't seems like it does anything for me either. It just feels like a normal mattress pad. Not exactly worth the price for a normal mattress pad!
5,powers of the psalms,The book fits into the spiritual guidelines set for development. It is simple and easy for training
5,Power of Psalms Purchase,"Great book. purchased from OneWorlds7, some misunderstand with original shipment but seller promptly took care of matter. Would order the book, have ordered it several times already. Good quick prayer companion."
2,well...,I bought this book because I was interested in using the Psalms with my work but I have to say I was a bit dissapointed. I did like the uses given and the suggestins of candle colors to burn with the Psalms but I did not like that the King James Bible was used for this book. The King James Bible is probably the worst translation out there. I decided to use the working related to each psalm in this book in conjunction with the Catholic Living Bible. The Catholic bible is far superior and much more powerfull for use as a conjure book.
1,A mediocre piece of work!,"One of the few Anna Riva books that I own, this one actually does contain some useful knowledge and instruction. (There is also a lot of garbage too.....just have to sort it out!) I am ambivilent about recommending it.....buy it or don't....either way, you are not missing much!"
1,Powers of the Psalms (Occult Classics),"This book is written by someone with a strong occult background! Call me closed minded, or call me one who investigates an author before I purchase a book, but I did not purchase this book after I did some research. Considering her other writings and the little I read of this book at a nearby theological sem. library I would not tag this as Christian or Judaic."
1,powers of the psalms,"Not at all pleased with this book, I did'nt know had to do with evil how could someone take the psalm and use it for evil. So of course it burned it. I think this book and all books that have to do with satanic worship should not be sold and should be burnt. This world already has enough evil in it without someone selling books on it."
3,It's cute,This is a cute book but it's made for an older child. I bought it for my 2 1/2 year old and he doesn't love it.
5,A view beyond the Veil,Ms. Mumm provides important insights to the lives and motives of women in Victorian England who chose to enter the uncharted territory of active religious life in a world which not only frowned upon the notion of an independant woman but also one where it was illegal in the church for a woman to express herself thus. It was amusing to discover the ruses which some Mothers Superior devised to circumvent attempts at episcopal and clerical control. Given the difficulty in procuring access to documentation where it survives her work is an important step to futher understand an often unknown aspect of the not too distant past as seen through the eyes of women. It is all too often assumed that women both Anglican and Roman Catholic chose the cloister simply for pious reasons alone when the true picture was far more complex. This is a book that needed to be written.
1,Don't waste your money on this DVD,"This video has no redeeming value. It's nothing but a lot of narrating-talk-talk-talk-and very little entertaiment. There are only brief appearances of all the stars that are mention in the description. Myself, I want to be entertained by these singers and this does not happen. People don't waste your money on this-untless you enjoy a lot of talking."
4,Nice gift,I bought it as a gift. Our friends used in their wedding day and really liked it. The product is exactly what you expect.
3,Cute,"Got several compliments. They are very cute. But after 1 wash, the glass part fell out of the base. Should be easy enough to re-glue."
5,Best Christmas gift I've ever purchased,"I bought this chair for my niece as a Christmas gift, and the mother of the child is still blessing me for that. She says her daughter loves to cuddle up in it with a book or teddy bear, and it looks adorable in the room too! I think I will be purchasing another few of these from ababy for next christmas. Holiday season is almost here......"
5,Exactly as I wanted it,"It was in fairly good condition, had the access code, and in general was everything that it was described as. It came on time too because I had it shipped for fast delivery!"
4,Mr. Brown,I enjoyed the CD the first time I listened to it. But half of the CD is music & the other half is Me. Brown talking to Cora via telephone. I wish there was more singing.
1,disapointment,If I would have know how bad this cd was I would not have bought if even for 4 dollars my family love madea movies but this cd was a let down will not even give as q gift
4,Fun to listen to,"If you like old school gospel, or if you like Mr. Brown, then you'll like this CD. If you like old school gospel AND you like Mr. Brown, then you'll LOVE this CD! I couldn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked to have more music and less comedy. That being said, there is still enough music to make me happy enough to give it a well-deserved 4 stars."
5,NOT TO BAD GREAT BARGAIN HERE.,5 stars this is a relaxing album here.I had to get this because i have only heard certain parts.So i wanted to hear the whole thing.IT IS WORTH hearing and buying.Also this is rare they often have only certain parts.
5,Wonderful book.,"This is an excellent book. To be perfectly honest, my daughter and I are in the habit of reading spiritual books together before she goes to bed. She's a teenager now and we still maintain this habit. After reading some deeper and spiritually complex books like ""The Imitation of Christ"" and Catherine Emmerich's book on the Passion of Christ, we found the story style of this book engaging. We are not through reading it yet, but she is definitely gaining some valuable spiritual insight."
1,Failed after a few months' light usage (2 refills),"Ultra light use in my home office - it has now just started making a quiet ""pop-pop-pop"" sound and refused to continue. It was not jammed - it had failed completely. I messed around a bit with making sure that the solenoid wasn't stuck or that a wire wasn't lose or that the safety that keeps it from firing when staples are being put it might be stuck. Nothing. $45 down the drain.This thing sounds like someone is hitting your desk with a hammer as hard as they can. I could put up with that, but it seems as if it's simply shaken itself to death.Postscript:Bostich replaced the stapler without any questions - said they're using mine for testing/debugging."
4,Classic is an apt term,"Of the three movies, Sitting Bull (starring Iron Eyes Cody) and Battles of Chief Pontiac (Movie is in Black & White but is appropriate for the setting and date,stars Lon Chaney, Jr. and Lex Barker)are the best. Even tho Cry Blood, Apache is a poor third, the set is well worth the money. The injustices done to the American Indian is clearly and, I think, fairly presented."
2,"Some good, some bad","The third movie in this epic (Battle of Chief Pontiac) does not play. May I please exchange it for a fully functional copy? Otherwise, my husband loved it. Great for the grandkids to watch, too."
1,INFURIATING!!,"The key value of this product is the ability to sync large or many files across machines. I travel a lot, so being able to synchronize my laptop files with my office and home workstation is the whole point of Laplink Gold. You can imagine, then, my horror at finding that this product does not work with my laptop: Dell Latitude CS 400XT. Plug in the USB cable, and the system hard resets! Very nasty.Back in November 2000, the online support admitted that ""other problems with laptops have been reported"", and they would contact me with details of a patch as soon as one is available. I have heard nothing to date. Furthermore, their website makes no mention of laptops that do or don't work with this product. No mind for the customer. They just take your money, and fob you off.When added to the USB cable price, the entire package costs around $200, but provides no value at all. To all prospective purchasers: BE CAREFUL (or be ready to demand your money back)."
2,for larger stacks of paper/ Can't get staples out of smaller stacks,"Easy and intuitive to put staples in. Easy to eject mis-formed staples. That's about where the good points end. Takes only one kind of staple that is long and heavy and is not right for 20-40 pages. you won't be able to staple it easily and quickly as the name implies and if the staple is bent, it will take forever to get the staple out with a standard staple remover. In fact I could not do it without pliers."
2,Looks great but !!!!!,"This could have been a great stapler. It will easily staple stacks of paper. The problem is swingline was more interested in selling special staples than providing a great stapler. Our local office max carries stacks of staples but only 1"" staples for this stapler. They carry all different sizes of heavy duty staples but only one size for this stapler. Buy something that will us any heavy duty staples if your in the market. Not this stapler."
4,Great book for the family,This book is a lot of fun for the family when waiting for food at a restaurant or on a long car ride.
4,construction superintendent,"Nice tool, pretty much does what they say. Bigger than I had wanted but still ok. Decent storage case. Also was able to hold the optional tri pod adapter. If it holds up over time I'll be satisfied."
2,"Not Quit Heaven, more like Purgatory","After listening to DJ Misja Helsloot's ""DEEP TRANCE"" I thought I would give some of this musical genera a try. I've been a Pro DJ in Europe and NYC for years,I'm into Trance and House. I'm sorry to say that the 2 disc set is mostly fillers, if that. There were a few nice tracks, but over all, not putting me in Heaven. I was hoping for some lush and deep relaxing Trance. Not the worst CD I've heard, but by far not the best. I would get DJ Misja's DEEP TRANCE over this if I we're you."
1,Chips!,This is so ironic. No chip top cover chips like crazy. It chips even those polishes that didn't really chip much without it. Ridiculous.
5,Memorable recipes,"I had this book when it first came out and lost it in my move away from the Boston area. Her Shrimp with Pink Peppercorn and Ginger Cream sauce is amazing, and I have talked about it to friends all these years! I was very excited to find her book here and just got my own copy (again). My husband can't wait to try it. Looking through the book, I want to get the Chocolate Lasagna on my next dinner party menu. Yum!"
5,An excellent book on Chicago's public murals,It's genuinely encyclopedic covering all of the murals currently extant and having some photos and info on some of the missing and lost murals.
3,Ok but not great,If you are looking for accuracy then this is not the thermometer for you. We had it on our patio door but noticed it was just not on the mark especially when it got hotter. If you want a general idea then it might be ok but it's not a great thermometer
1,outdoor thermometer,This outdoor Timex thermometer is supposed to stick to the outside of the glass. It doesn't for more than 2 or 3 minutes-falls right off (whether installed wet or dry) I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Junk,Does not stick to glass more than a couple of hours.. I tried it indoors inside a display case. the plastic is quite hard and seems to not have good suction.The meter itself didnt change readings when I took it to a very humid room.So its accuracy is doubtful.
1,Piece of crap,"Does not stick to windows, ridiculously inaccurate, cheap, avoid. Humidity version just as bad!"
1,Rip Off Version of Ricky Martin Europa,"Bootleg copy of ""Ricky Martin: Europa"" only at 5x the price and it doesn't include the special features. It doesn't even include all of ""Dime Que Me Queres"" the title song. I couldn't use it in most of my dvd players (because it was a bootleg copy). This concert also goes by the title ""Ricky Martin in Spain""."
4,Some theoretical papers of a Nobel Prize Winner,"This book contains theoretical papers of John C. Harsanyi, published from 1956 through 1980. He was winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994 (along with John Nash and Reinhard Selten). His contributions to game theory provide a solid basis for dealing with the use of Bayesian methods in economic decision making (that is, basing decisions on subjective assessments of probabilities), and several of the papers presented here provide the theory underlying such methods. Other papers deal with models for bargaining and cooperation in decision making, and they too have been of special importance in applications of game theory in a wide range of contexts, including international negotiation as well as economics."
3,Out of Date Information,"You really gotta be kidding!! Someone asks nearly $200 for a pamphlet that is printed on poor paper that merely is a listing of records known by Monk and Powell as of 1969?? This is fine work for its time, but is very out of date and offers nothing to contemporary discographical research. So what if its a ""first edition"". Get real, and let this dealer sit on the book."
1,dont waste your money,"the product arrived quickly, but away it farnished and caused infection! dont waste your money."
1,"Westinghouse 8 "" LED Umbrella Light","I had high expectations when purchasing this item. When placing it on my umbrella poles it doesn't have the shine or light coming down as I had expected. I wouldn't buy it again, or give one as a gift. I was quite dissappointed."
1,EXTREME GADGETS COUNTERFEIT ITEM,I purchased the Westinghouse 75750 Umbrella light from extreme gadgets and I am very disappointed and I want a refund and I do not think it is fair that I have to pay to ship back. This is a counterfeit product. I have the original Westinghouse umbrella light and it has a collar that clamps to the pole that the led fixture attaches to. this is a cheap knock off with no collar even though the description clearly describes how to install the collar and slide the lamp over on your item's page. EXTREME GADGETS are selling fake items and I intend to make that known. I'm also forwarding this to Westinghouse so they know Extreme Gadgets is putting their name on cheap faulty knockoffs.
2,"Not a good solution, despite being cordless.","I wanted to something without any cords to get tangled that was small and easy to use. This round disc splits in half and you have to reassemble to the two halves around the umbrella pole. The problem is that you need to remove it to close the umbrella properly. Additionally as we all know LED lights can be very bright and provide harsh lighting. While LEDs may be fine for flashlights and such, they don't set the right mood for an calm night on the patio. I guess I'll have to look for a hard wired permanent solution."
4,Westinghours Umbrella Light review,"This light is really cool, we had a party over the weekend and the light was great. It worked well and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested."
3,umbrella light,"I bought this for my Mom. She can't get it to stay in place on her umbrella pole. I put the batteries in it for her and showed her how to put it on the pole. I'm sure it has to do with the strength in her hands, not the product."
2,Chinese- knock off,"Its true. These are just a cheap Chinese knock off, not a Westinghouse product. It works but feels like it is very cheap and could break if I forget to use kid gloves..."
3,good product for the price,"we were looking for some outdoor lighting for our patio. This light does the trick. However, the plastic latch was broken upon arrival either due to to shipment or manufacturing. I was able to glue it and it seems to be fine. For the price it is good. The light is a little bright, but we moved the light down to the lower part of the umbrella and that seems to be fine."
1,Poor Design,"The Liftmaster Engineer that designed this unit should be fired. The unit is designed to be mounted to the ceiling of your garage. But to change out the batteries, you have to remove the lid. To remove the lid, you have to remove the four screws in the TOP of the unit; which means you have to have access to the top of the unit and thus you have to completely remove the unit from the ceiling before you can remove and replace the batteries. How hard would it have been to allow the battery compartment to be accessed via a door on the side of the unit. Poor, poor design."
4,Peace of mind,Good product. It's good peace of mind if the power goes out. our garage door is just too heavy to lift without the opener.
3,Wrong photo,"This is the wrong photo. The item I received (which came via UPS, despite the text above) is not shaped like the mat in the photo. It is rectangular with a rectangular lip. I'll use it, but I'm disappointed."
4,A superior chairmat,"If your wheeled desk chair is killing your carpet, the only solution is a chairmat. Even the cheapest chairmat does the job. The problem is durability. The economy mats which come from Staples last no longer than 2 years (from my experience). The cheap plastic mat hardens and becomes ""brittle"" and then cracks. Well, this Rubbermaid chairmat costs twice as much as the economy mat, but I believe it is worth it! This mat is thicker, is of superior material, is better shaped and is more attractive. Moreover, the chair rolls around better than ever. And I'm guessing this mat will outwear its predecessors, so that the price will be justified."
1,Poor Quality,"Fortunately, we did not purchase this at Amazon, but another store. It cracked within several weeks and later on, we returned it as a failed product. Rubbermaid is a good company but this is not a high quality product."
1,Shipping is insane,"I put these in my cart and went to check out, and the shipping was listed as $120! The item total was only $95! BEWARE!"
4,Dashiel Hammett meets William Gibson,"great read. neo/retro pulp fiction. engaging characters. lush environment. the seedy underbelly of modern Japan was never so enjoyable. only negative was the author's overzealous desire to paint too elaborate a picture at times. i realize he lives in Japan, but some descriptions of the scenes ran on a bit."
1,glad I bought it used,the editing was terrible -erm was it edited? The poor structure and cliched story telling made this book unbearable beyond chapter 1.
5,PLS3 Laser,Does what it is ment too. It only puts a dot and not a line so if all you wan't is a level or plumb point it works but if you need a level line this is not the model to chose
3,"Great tool, but not very rugged","The PLS3 is a great tool, but not very rugged. It shoots a bright red light in broad daylight that you can easily see from at least 50 feet away. I used it to level my 30x20 rectangular foundation and it was accurate to at least 1/4 inch at 30 feet. As long as you handle it with care, it is very accurate and self-levelling. Unfortunately, we dropped it a few times from a height of 2 feet or so to the ground. I would have expected the PLS3 to be more rugged than this since it is used at a construction site - but after it is dropped, it goes way off course by at least 2 feet per 30 feet. The self-levelling feature goes haywire too, and the color of the light won't change even if you tilt it 45 degrees. Then, when you shake it a little, the accuracy changes again, sometimes to 1 feet per 30 feet, sometimes more of less. I would feel more comfortable if it will at least flag an error when it is off-level, rather than making me think that it continues to work."
2,Great when it works,"This item is very handy when it works. Mine died within 2 years with minimal use without ever a drop. It also has an annoying habit of turning itself off all the time. Very expensive for what it is I feel, there are better more affordable alternative. I would not buy it again."
3,This Is a,"3 aNd a halF.Yo..Not as good as the Bible.Lot's of stuff written by a man who can't know what a woman want..Karla's intro ain't here.He was image,ritual,might and glory in his oral speeches.He was image master.Not as Poetic as Satanic Bible.Blanche Barton's ""Church of Satan"" may be a good place for you.Or Anton's boOks of essay's like ""The Devil's Notebook"" thanK you very much!Say:Why's Robert Graysmith's book the most important oNe on Zodiac? Hmm..DOn't know."
1,The Satanic Witch is an oxymoron,"This book is a perfect example of someone contradicting themselves, a witch by their very nature does not believe or have anything to do with Satan, its just that some people are so wrapped up in common superstion that they'll believe anything, this book is an insult to me! The very deffinition of witchcraft is a nature based religion wich in one way or another revolves around, or somehow includes the workings of Magick, satan is purely a Christian belief, not a pagan or witch belief"
4,.,"You'll learn more from this book then you ever will from watching Tyra Banks about catching and manipulating a guy (or girl). I wont say this book is out dated because you can quickly re-apply the hippie jive stuff into modern day examples, but a few things gave me pause...It took me a good long few seconds to realize what a 'fall' was and I still don't know what the hell 'duck soup' means..."
2,You would be better off reading an issue of Cosmopolitan...,"I was impressed by La Vey's ""Satanic Bible"" and am now a Satanist, but this book was a total disappointment. Everything is left right on the surface, and there is nothing for the mind to ponder upon. As a woman I don't find it at all offensive, he is right that we should never deny our feminine powers. I do find that the advise he gives to women on how to impress men tasteless. A man will never find a woman who openly reveals her underwear sexy, there are a lot more subtle ways to entice a man. Basically, this book is not worth reading for advise on makeup and clothes...visit a professional beauty consultant for that. The only good advise you will see in this book is on how to spot a man that represents your demonic self - once you find him, you will truily be satisfied. HAIL SATAN!"
4,WAY TO GO!,"I myself believe in the philosophies of Dr. LaVey, and this book is essential to any female satanist. LaVey always believed the woman is the strongest sex, and i agree, and in this book he gives the woman great advice on the arts of seduction, sex etc. I give it 4 stars because i am male, so I cant use it for much, but still it's a very good book, but not on of LaVeys best works."
2,Witch=sexual prowless?,"I have read The Satanic Bible and the Satanic Rituals and really enjoyed them both. I found Mr. Lavey's ideas to be very common sense, and his language was completely engaging. So when I discovered that my local library had The Satanic Witch I was very excited. However from the moment that I opened the book I was disappointed. I expected a book teaching me ways to become a succesful witch using my magical powers. But that's not what I found. I found a book telling my how to use magic using my sexual abilities. How to manipulate people (men especially). This is not what being a witch is about. That may be part of it but an entire book dedicated to it is obsurd."
5,An Indication as to Who Haven't Read This Book...,"Announcement: Any of the reviews here that mention anything about this book having anything to do with worshipping the devil (none of LaVey's philosophies teach devil-worhipping) are written by people that have NOT read this book... Logically thinking, one can conclude that those particular reviews are worthless, since how can one review a book without having read it... It's almost like judging someone by the color of their skin (cover)... I hear witches complain so much about how they're stereotyped, yet some hypocrytically turn around and stereotype Satanists, and refuse to look at what True Satanism is truly about. Recommendation: Read the book..! Especially if you happen to be one of the witches that don't follow the ""saintly white-light feminist"" path..."
4,"INSIGHTFUL, UN-APOLAGETICALLY BLUNT AND DOWN TO EARTH","Whether or not all of the perceptive ideas and suggestions put forward here are 100% La Vey, he has gathered the gems and discarded the garbage and infused his own sense of unerring and uncompromising admissions of human assets and stupidity. He has offered something which can be put to use in the present, literally as a down to 'Earth' system, which is something for all of those wiccans and paranoid 'white light mystics' to godess 'mythos' they often seem incapable of dealing with the most minor interactions which occur on their ""Earth"" and they that would most benefit from the anecdotes in this book would be the last to take the advice. I feel that La Vey's demise was a sad loss and whether or not one agrees with all of his approaches, his written works (all of which I have read and enjoyed) are a must read for those who are looking for workable systems which are not arcane and academic ciphers"
5,Manual of Lesser Black Magic,"This book, intended primarily for women, outlines the theory and practice of Lesser Black Magic. The practice of Satanism as a method of fullfilling one's own personal goals in the world, sans self-deceit is described in great detail. A no-nonsense description of how to be a powerful, influential person in the lives of others as well as in your own."
3,Mostly full of it but some interesting insights,"The Satanic Witch is mostly full of crap. It has some very interesting insights and some useful information but about 99% of it just doesn't hold up. Rarely has it been spot on with anything. Worth the 8.00 just for the bibliography, though."
3,Don't buy it. It's not that good.,"The book is OK. It has some interesting things but it has some contradictions and it was written in the 70s and it talks about sex and how people used to behave back then. Things have changed a lot since, so the advices are totally outdated. I don't think it was a waste of time reading it, I said to myself ""That is so true"" or ""I disagree completely"" but I wouldn't recommend it. While ""The Satanic Bible"" is a great eye opener book, ""The Satanic Witch"" is just alright. There isn't much new about it and it certainly doesn't help you get the guy or manipulate people."
3,Bombast and Grind ...,"This is material for the modern age set in front of an enormous ... bibliography which takes up the bulk of the printed pressing. It is an addition of The Satanic Bible and reads like material that was chopped from the book, but overall worthy of reading. It's not for the faint of heart and it has a very erotic tone."
3,lavey is brilliant.,"Anton LaVey has sheded valuable insight into the mysterious philosophy! of witchcraft. His tremendous well of knowledge and direct experience provides the reader with an articulated perspective; I would suggest to forget the websterian definitions of WITCH and culminate your own through practice and stern belief. There always exist infinitely many ways to classify something/somebody. Work on yourselves without censor; live through, not by the book."
2,"Interesting ideas, but...","I quite agree with cwperry's review, below. The ""body typing"" theory, which comprises much of the basis for the book, is interesting and possibly accurate occassionally. Most of the rest of the book is based on LaVey's concept of *his* ideal woman, which may or may not be yours.It does include some basic, common-sense (though sense is not too common nowadays) thoughts on the whole mating ritual process. Although primarily directed at a female audience, male readers can also get a few ideas out of here as well."
3,Witch does not mean Wicca,"I've read the book. It's ok. I don't have any problems with the title, either. I'm a Wiccan Witch. There are Christian Witches, Satanic Witches, etc... The title of ""witch"" refers to one who practices magick. A Wiccan is one who follows the Wiccan religion. So it is entirely possible for there to be a Satanic Witch. I don't agree with the philosophies in this book, because they go against my nature of doing thing. I don't need to seduce a man to feel powerful, but for the people who do, or who choose to, should read the book. And everyone should get over the name! It is not an insult at Wiccans!"
4,Great insight into the minds of women,"I am not a satanist, but I enjoyed Lavey's writing style and prose. It amazed me that he knew so much about why we women do the strange things we do. it helped me to be more aware of how much my sexual desires and unconcious have a great influence on everything I do. It also gives handy advice on using your sexuality to get what you want. I recommened this book for all men who want to get inside the female mind."
3,An intresting read.,"The book has some beneficial information and points of view. But for the most part I felt it was the way LaVey wanted women to be. And nobody but yourself is gonna make a better decision on how you want to look, act, or think. So, I guess what im saying is read it, but is one man's perspective and nothing else. Be your own kind of witch."
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE! TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE PRINT IS CLEAN!,"You can't buy much for $5.98, but you can buy this cool Classic Sci-Fi DVD set. The set features 3 cheapy Sci-Fi films. The transfer for Teenagers from Outer Space is nice and clean! The other two are good prints. They are not as clean as teenagers,but they may never have been. If you like these cheesy cheap flicks,this is worth the price of admission."
1,Doesn't work.,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas to use in her classroom and was excited to give it to her, but it doesn't work. It doesn't say that I have to buy special staples so I just got the Target brand. It's not jamming, but every time you try to staple anything the staple tray shoots out, or it staples but doesn't fold the bottom part of the staple over, or it doesn't push the staple into the paper at all. I'm angry that I now have to waste time going to the post office and shipping this back after waiting for it to come back into stock for so long."
3,They are ok,"These snips are just as good as any others you would buy in a big box store, but they are not great. Bessey tends to make great products (clamps mostly) that are a cut above the rest. That is not the case with these snips."
1,Way too Baggy!,These pants fit nothing like the other 3 pairs that I have. They are ridiculously baggy in the pant legs and therefore do not look good at all!!
3,"Nice pants, but way too long and baggy","Pants were good quality, but were way too long and baggy all over. Was not able to keep them, had to return."
5,adidas pants,"Arrived in tiem, given as a gift. Recipient loved them. Every thing worked out. Good deal on them too. Nice."
1,That's what she said,"These pants have an obscenely wide girth about the calves which looks extremely awkward, especially if you have a 30 or 32 inch waist. I ordered the medium size and although the waist fits perfectly, the legs are so loose they make me look foolish. I don't see how anyone with a thin to average physique could enjoy wearing these in medium or smaller sizes. Score 1 for capitalism. Fat people ruin everything."
1,Bad sizing,"The men's small is the same size as the youth extra large. So of course it was too short. Not sure if that's how they do their size chart, or if this one is faulty."
4,"OK, but not great","As other reviewers have said, these run *very* big. I ordered large, whereas I take close to a 38-40 in pants, & these are still baggy on me. Not thrilled by the fabric, but it's good enough for around the house."
4,Good product,The pants have a bit of extra fabric but fit well for a full build. They have held up well to usage. Recommend them for stocky builds.
1,Super Baggy and Thick material,"OMG!!! This is the BAGGIEST pants I have ever seen. I am a 5'11"" and ordered Large. Although the waist and length fits well the sheer size of the leg fit is incredible. My leg can fit 3 times and would still have extra room. Also the material is very hot and heavy. The 5 minutes I had the pants on I was already sweating."
1,Poor fit,"I seriously was disappointed and tried to return but time had expired. Gave them away. Poor, poor fit, too heavy"
2,Huge!,These run a size too big and the lead color is actually medium grey with black strips. The lead color appears black in the picture. I returned them - Amazon is great about returns.
4,Adidas Men's 3-Stripe Tricot Pant,"These are exactly what you would expect from adidas a pant that was well Constructed, and with added value of being able to get them in a 5x when most retailers only go up tp 2x in store P.s Sizing on these were Generous !"
1,"Crappy quality, poor styling","These pants are so wide at the feet it's ridiculous...I'm 5'8"" and originally ordered these in Medium, way too long, then got them in a small and now they're the right length and waist size, but way too baggy.Don't waste your money"
2,XL is VERY big,"My husband is a 38, 220lbs 6'1"" and a relatively fit guy with a bit of a gut. He wears most XL's comfortably but these pants were HUGE. Too baggy and too long. The crotch hung very low too (unless he pulled them up Earkle style!)"
4,"Nice fit, good product","I brought these for my son and he really likes them. They fit good not baggy and the lenght is perfect. He is 5' 8'' and weights 164, he is small/meduim build and solid.Good product!"
3,"Quality Name Brand, Fits Too Big","My current pair of workout pants were recently retired when the draw string to keep them in place ripped, leaving me in constant fear that they would fall at any moment. I ordered these because I know the Adidas name, as pretty much everyone does. They feel like a quality product, the only problem is they are so big. The waist isn't an issue because the drawstring can always be adjusted, but the leg length is just way too long. The legs constantly drag, which isn't good during a workout. It's distracting and it'll cause the pants to show signs of wear and tear faster then they should. I guess I could have ordered a smaller size, but I'm 6 foot nothing and haven't worn an XL in anything since about highschool."
4,Very Comfortable,"After reading the review saying they were way too big, I bought a L instead of my normal XL. This was a mistake. They are not as big as the 'Spanish Armada guy' make them out to be. Pockets are deep and material is breathable, yet warm. After wearing them a couple times and having the dog jump up on me, the thighs are starting to pill. I would still recommend these pants."
4,Good fit but slightly larger than needed,It is slightly more expensive and bigger than the Spalding pair I got at the same time. Nevertheless I like it also and will be comparing both with use. The initial quality looks good. Durabilty vote is still outstanding.
3,Little Long - Quality Material,"These aren't all THAT bad, but seem slightly long. I'm a big guy, and the sizing was pretty much spot on in the waist. The only real sizing complaint I have is the thighs.. they are abnormally tight for some reason. I am a cyclist and have pretty meaty thighs, but these are oddly tight. Don't get me wrong though, they aren't spandex tight.. or so tight that I wouldn't wear them. Just tight enough to not fit perfectly.The quality of the material is impressive. Adidas is normally good about using good quality material, and that they did in this case. They are a bit warm, but they do well on rather cold fall jogs. They have lasted me about a year and still are in good shape, so even though they are a bit expensive I suppose I got my money out of them."
1,whoa,"FAIL... the pants were around 9 inches too long on my grandpa and hes very tall. Also I wouldnt say these come in ""big"" sizes, they are more lean and tall fit"
2,Stitching coming off,"I bought these pants in october 2012. I use it for my workouts (3times a week for 2-3 hours) and hardly at other times. After only 3 months the stitching is coming off. I had used an adidas pant earlier which was really good and lasted for a long time, but this one was not up to expectations.Sizing and material was excellent, but with the stitching coming off I don't know how long are these pants going to last."
4,Very good - except for being a bit long,"My son is very happy with these pants. They have large pockets which was an important factor for him.But he has said they are a bit long- and he's 5'11""!"
3,Ok if your overweight and extremely tall,"These pants are very good quality and comfortable. Only problem is they are huge. I'm 5'11 170 Lbs and the waste fits fine but they are sooooo long and I could fit both my legs plus more in just 1 legging. Built for a saggy, baggy or just a super large person."
5,As comfortable as your remember,These are definitely the same old school pants you remember. Very comfortable and look good enough to be work around town.
3,"It's really good in some areas, but vague on others...","I took the AP Psychology exam on 5/17/99. The book is great for independent study for the exam (I didn't have an AP Psychology course at my school.) From this book, I gained test confidence and a positive attitude. The sample test questions in the book were different than the ones on the test, though. If you want to know more about the test and the book, email me and I'll be happy to tell you!"
2,Short- and nothing like the exam,"I took the AP exam, and found that this book was nothing like the exam. Most of questions in the book were about statistics and about famous psychologists. The practice exams were short and choppy, and did not help me at all practice for the exam."
1,This book was not worth the money!!,"You want my opinion, here it is and it's not pretty. I took the AP Psychology Exam on May 17, 1999. I was enrolled in an AP Psychology course at school and I was only using this book for the tests and essay questions. It was NOTHING like the AP Exam. The multiple choice tests focused on one topic entirely too much and there were hardly any statistical questions on the actual exam. The essays were way to easy and they did not even come close to the type of free response questions on the AP Exam which typically give you a list of items that you should use to answer a question even though they really do not relate to the question. This book, however, made for a good review to quickly and briefly (and I do mean briefly) look over the material, but if you are unaware of a concept you will have to get a text book to look it up to get an understandable answer. Unfortunately there is not another AP Psychology review book."
1,Horrible! Ambiguous and very dry,"The text is very dry and boring. As mentioned by another reviewer, the practice questions are in the wrong format. I noticed that many of the multiple-choice questions are unclear and thus confusing.Despite the reviews here, I bought this book under my teacher's recommendation and am very disappointed with the book."
1,"not available, never received it.","I never received this product, still waiting. Where is it, did it ever ship? Linda Briggeman"
3,The righteous Brothers in concert,The sound wasn't too good because they were too old. It didn't sound like the cd at all. I think the sound track could have been better.
2,I just had to listen,I was hoping for a little better nostalgic oldies performance. But it looks liketheir voices didn't make it. The Roxies hot lighting in the rear also didn't help. Other than that it was good for one performance.
4,Great Concert,"Good music, great sounds, takes you back to your youth. Lets you remember the fun times with that special someone listening to cool tunes by great groups. Just close your eyes and drift back to yesteryear."
2,Righteous Brothers,I was very disappointed with this DVD and I wouldn't waste the money to buy it. Their signing along with the music was very poor. I love the Rightous Brothers but this concert just didn't make it.
5,Enjoy some soul music with this Righteous Brothers' concert DVD,"I did see them perform in Las Vegas about a year before Bobby Hatfield's death, and I had a center, third row seat in rock and roll heaven (that's how it felt to hear them in person).I was thrilled to find this DVD of one of their concerts and see famous folks in the audience singing and clapping along with the songs. There was a lot of soul in those voices the night they performed at this concert. It's one of the best concert DVDs in my collection."
2,Righteous Brothers in Concert,The DVD was not at all what we expected. The style was very different. We have been a fan of the Righteous Brothers for many years and found this one disappointing. Our personal favourite was Unchained Melody. This is the main reason we purchased it. The version on this DVD was nothing like we expected. We really wished we had never purchased it. We have watched it once and will not watch it again.
5,Very good book on crazy quilt and patchwork.,"I bought this for my sister who knew nothing about crazy quilting but wanted to try it and I chose this book out of the five I already own on the same topic to order for her. All around excellent book with photos and drawings and easy to understand directions. As far as I am concerned, it is a necessary part of my crazy quilting library."
5,A cartoonist's view of Presto,"I am a professional cartoonist, and believe me, a good correction pen is right up there with pen and paper. Presto is my favorite, hands down. It covers well, doesn't skip and lump up, and is controllable. Having run out of Prestos, I went looking for them at my usual stores and found them nowhere. Panic attack. Then I thought: Amazon. Why not? They sell everyting else. Voila! My Presto pens are winging their way to me as we speak. I am serene once more."
4,Use them for parts marking.,I know these are not intended for this but they work better than paint pens and are just as cheap. Havent a clue how the work as white out :) ...
5,Best Correction Pen Ever Made,I have used every brand and type of correction pen and this has always been the very best one but it's now harder to find. The tip is a fine point so it can hide tiny mistakes (particularly good for numerical changes) and it doesn't normally glob so you can actually write over it well.
1,SPILLED ALL OVER WHEN OPENED,"I had used his jumbo pen a few times and it went okay although it came out somewhat clumpy and I had to wait for it to dry. Then, today, I pulled on the cap to get the cap off to get to the pen part and the whole top came off and all the white-out went all over--my keyboard, my mouse, my mouse-pad, my sleeves, my hands, my desk. As you know, white-out is paint and it will not come off my keyboard and clothes. I used cleaner with bleach to try and get it off. And, off course, I lose money for the time I can't work cleaning the stuff and will have to get a new keyboard. Can't thank you enough, pentel presto."
2,New recipe not so good!,"I found the New recipe to be too sweet and artificial tasting...Yuk! This seems to be the trend in the American market change recipe's to a sweeter, cheaper artificial taste."
1,This is an answer key/workbook only!,"Before you buy...Many of the reviews for this item reference the Grammar. This is only an answer key/workbook. It does not contain the Grammar, nor are the answers given in context to allow you to read even the questions for the answers given. If you have the Grammar--buy this workbook. It would probably be great. Please also be aware that the Grammar is not even available for purchase for the Kindle from Amazon.If you do purchase this by mistake, Amazon Customer Service gets superior ratings for refunding your purchase (within 7 days)."
4,A modern grammar with use of the Biblical text and examples.,"Of all the Hebrew Grammar books on the market today this one is the most ""user friendly."" It puts the reader directly in the Bible and gives many examples. It is a life long companion to the biblical student. The binding, however, is awful and it will disintegrate by the second year of use."
3,i prefer the originals by Rampal,"i am a huge fan of these pieces having listened to them for over 30 years. however, these new recordings although good, do not have the sparkle or lightness of the originals. the originals i can play over & over again without getting tired of them, but the ones here seem dull in comparison. these seem a little bass heavy to me.& the price of this set is expensive. for me, i'll stay with my original 2 cds with Rampal."
1,Caution!,"Amazon does not tell you that this DVD ""Best of"" collection only has 5 songs/videos on it. If you are looking for Toby's current hits, you will be greatly disappointed. And, while Amazon will allow you to return it, if unopened, the shipping charges each way will not be refunded. $6 worth of to and from shipping charges for a $7.99 DVD isn't worth the effort. Save your money, and hope that Toby releases a real ""collection"" someday."
4,Great But Too Short!!,"My wife and I have been big fans of Toby Keith since we heard ""Beer For My Horses"" on a country compilation cd. This dvd is a welcome addition to our Toby Keith collection. There are only five videos on this dvd:""Should've Been A Cowboy"",""He Ain't Worth Missing"",""A Little Less Talk And A Little More Action"",""Who's That Man"" and ""Dream Walkin'"".Although it is short in content the videos are all great with excellent sound and vision quality. I guess this will have to do until a full concert dvd of Toby Keith becomes available."
2,Underwhelming for the price,"Case is adequate, but nothing special. NO FANS INCLUDED, so your actual cost is even higher. No real allowances for noise like the sonata series. I'll keep it to avoid shipping costs and get the project done. Would not buy another Ultra, back to antec or lian-li. Excellent service from Amazon, arrived in perfect shape and on-time."
4,easy install,"liked the case was very easy to work on, is set up for several different type motherboards almost tool less"
5,Blood Pressure Review,I am very pleased with my purchase of the Dot Matrix Wrist Blood Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor. Delivery was very prompt. The only concern that I have is that I did not receive a receipt or any paper work (from the company) with the product that I could use to prove when I purchased the product.
1,Not a reliable product,"I would not recommend this product at all. We received it last month, and it has not been accurate. The readings fluctuate even if it is within 5 minutes. We wrote to the company and they did make suggestions for us to try, such as sitting still while taking your blood pressure. My husband tried everything, still not accurate. He went to the doctors finally and had his actual blood pressure taken, and told the doctor about this particular model. The doctor said that this product was not a reliable one, and for the main reason that to get a proper reading, you should get a monitor that does not strap onto the wrist, but on the upper arm, as original blood pressure monitors are. I believe that this company does sell other blood pressure monitors, I would suggest purchasing another type from this company as they seem to be fair and willing to help."
1,Easy to use but wildly inaccurate,"This device was inaccurate to the point of being dangerous. MY BP is 115-120/70-75 all of the time. I tried this unit and got that reading some of the time but also got readings like 225/115, followed by 110/70, followed by 145/105, etc. All within 5 minutes of each other. I puchased an arm cuff unit and it works perfectly, 115/75 all of the time.My doctor told me not to use the wrist units, they don't work for everyone."
5,cleans extremely well,"product works as expected, installed new strings so i wont have to use this for a while"
5,Keeps away rust!,"Miraculously in 1996, I somehow stumbled upon Fast Fret. I thought, well it's pretty cheap, why not try it? I would apply the Fast Fret before playing guitar, and then I applied it after playing. Lo and behold, this stuff really worked to keep away the rust.I know that holding back rust is not the manufacturer's purpose for the product, but I find that it's been the only effective way of keeping me from changing strings so often. Like other reviewers here have stated, it's hard to tell when the Fast Fret will dry out, so keep one extra on hand just in case. Now, I only have to change strings about once a month. Great stuff!"
1,Don't Buy,"Learning the guitar is expensive and this is one lesson. The odor is bad. So bad I can not take it.Change the strings, Don't mess with this junk. Its not just the odor. I do not want anything this string close to my eyes. I was hunting for a solution to sweat and sticky. It helped the sticky thing some but created more problems that it helped."
1,Not For Serious Players,"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name, but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too..."
5,Essential for any guitar player!,This is my fifth time buying this stuff! I really like the new container. The tin is way nicer than the old plastic one. This stuff works great and lasts forever! I play daily and one stick will last me at least a year before it gets too dirty/dry to use. One swipe is plenty (2 strings at a time from nut to bridge); then just fold the cloth and wipe clean. Makes moving power chords and soloing so much easier.
4,Good Product and Merchant,"On time delivery. Great product and found that others I know use it as well. Bought two, but one was mostly dried out. Hopefully that was a fluke. Second one was fine and so far has lasted about 5 times longer than the first one."
4,Good Stuff,"I use this stuff everytime i change strings, it works great for moisturizing your frets and making it smoother for playing."
4,Robolaser,"I have been using my Robolaser for 2 years not and it is a great tool. Simplicity for 1 person working by themselves. The beam is very visible and you don't have to hold any other instrument. Is a bit tough in the right light conditions to see the beam move to the location of your work, while outside. Very portable and easy to set up and go to work."
1,Very Poor 5.1 Quality,"This DVD-Audio is not very high fidelity, compared to almost every dvd-audio I have (and I have many). Would give it 0 stars if possible. Even at a low price I'm sorry I purchased it. Can I have my money back? Really."
4,The best gift for my best friend,"I bought this DVD for a friend of mine during the the stay with my son and his family in Texas and gave it to my friend in The Netherlands on his birthday one week ago. My friend was extremely surprised, because in our homecountry it is not for sale (yet).We looked and listened to it over and over with al the guests on his birthday party A great succes !!!"
1,There are better options!,"Presumably, the chief purpose of a volume such as this is to serve as an inexpensive text for undergraduates. Scholars will turn to more elaborate (and more expensive) editions.Unfortunately, any students who are assigned this edition will spend as much time trying to understand the stilted English translation as they will Descartes' philosophy.Fortunately, there are several readily available English versions of the Meditations that are far more readable than this one. Hackett publishes a translation by Donald Cress that is actually five cents cheaper than this one, and there are even free versions on the Internet that surpass this translation in clarity (and occasionally accuracy).Perhaps the only good reason for assigning this edition would be an undying loyalty to Notre Dame. Indeed, for some that will be reason enough!"
2,Choose Chadwick!,"While I agree that the feat of compressing early Christian history into just under 300 pages is laudable, this book suffers from spelling mistakes (including one on the first page ""ofen"" for ""often""), random changes of tense, awkward sentence structure, and outrageously biased opinions such as calling Tertullian a ""bigot"" without good cause (see page 69). Admittedly, many of these faults are the editor's, but they all contribute to a sense that the book was assembled hastily and carelessly. Hall's book hangs together much more comprehensively if the reader pretends he or she is at a live lecture, since Hall's prose style lends itself more to an oral presentation than to a written work. All in all, if you are a stickler for grammar and punctuation, choose Chadwick's ""The Early Church"" ...lots of good information without the aggravation."
3,I Like Satanika,"Credit possibly Danzig alone for keeping the content of his comics unpredictable. This sees Satanika doing battle with angels while she and Igrat pusure Dalkiel. This doesn't have very many fans except for diehard fans of Danzig's music and people sick enough to order them from his website. Verotik is usually hard to find anywhere but California. Sure, your next door comic shop might caryy some once in a while but I wouldn't count on it very often."
3,Poorly written,I bought this one for my IBM XML Certification Exam.But after reading 4 chapters I must say that the book is poorly written. This book confirms to me that insight is one thing and ability to express the ideas is another.The book is divided into 6 chapters. There are some good programs that are small and crispy. But the explanations are awkward. There are some mistakes/typos as well.
2,Bad writing,have finished 3 chapters. Nothing great as yet as far as content is concerned.I picked this book because it is written by someone who manages SAX API. But unfortunately the writing is NOT clear. Normally oreilly books are an easy read. Am finding this to be confusing :-(
1,"The TV is fine, seller is not","This TV is fine it does everything that a little TV of its size should do. Nice sound. Nice Picture. HOWEVER, my seller who goes by ""lehman student"" is terrible. First of all, they take FOREVER to ship the TV and when it gets here, it has NO remote and it shows up with a black patch on the screen. I am unable to see what is going on behind this patch. I want to return this TV."
3,6 deck card shuffler,"I bought 2 of the 6 deck shufflers mostly out of curiosity. It is mechanically like the older model 4 deck shuffler so will probably not have a very long service life. Unless you need to shuffle 6 decks of cards, I would recommend buying the 4-deck model."
2,card shuffler,"This shuffler is more hassle than it is worth. I guess you get what you pay for. The cards all get caught on the sides. It really doesn't work very well, but when you're trying to shuffle 4-6 decks you need help. I will be looking for a better quality machine."
1,6 deck card shuffler by Pachi Paradice,"This 6 deck card shuffler by Pachi Paradice, which I bought on 4/25/09, does not work. One side of it does not operate and I have used different batteries in it to be sure that isn't the problem but the gears for that side will not turn. I bought it at the request of a friend and she didn't use it for several days and I didn't know on receipt that it didn't work. I don't have the paper work that came with it, evidently she threw it away. Do I have any recourse with this in a refund or replacement?"
1,Piece - O - Crappo,"This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler.1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy2. Door Stop3. Play Street Hockey4. Stress Release Stomping Toy5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift6. Modern Art for Coffee Table7. Nerf Ball Target Practice8. Condom DispenserKind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun!PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it."
1,Shuffler has stopped working.,"I have used shuffer once a week since purchasing, I play cards on Tuesday with at least 20 others. Many of the people have had their shuffer's for well over three years. I have had mine for a few months, and it has stopped working. Need advise on what to do with this problem."
3,China Shuffler,Purchased a number of these at two different times and had to send one back from each order. Doesn't appear to make a difference which one you buy since I believe they are all made at the same factory in china. Oh for a good old USA made product.Last return cost me almost 30% of the cost of the product to return it. Will no longer be shopping at Amazon.
3,could be better,This card shuffler works okay. The downside is it flips card on their side and screws up the rest of the cards. I had one like this before and it rarely did this. Back to the drawing board.
5,Our Canasta shuffler,We have worn out more shufflers and this one seems to be doing real well. It is used every week four at least 8 hands with 5 decks.
5,Large card shuffler,"I don't consider this a childs game. It is used by adults at my home and others that we play card with. Six other adults that we know have one of these shufflers. If we are going to play cards with someone who wants to learn the game we play, we take it with us. It makes shuffling 5 or 7 decks of cards much easier."
3,6 deck card shuffler,This card shuffler is really pretty good and a great help when using a lot of decks to play cards.
3,The Live Experience,The CD was not what I actually expected. The presentations are good just not exactly what I expected.
2,nothing special,"I like Tamala Mann's spirit but this cd just seemed to be missing something. I listened to it twice and even tried to watch the dvd that came with it but it just didn't move me.kj-belleville, il"
5,Wide Angle Lens for Sony Video Camera,This item works great! Received on time and assists in getting great videos. Recommend one for all photo bugs.
5,Absolutely Great!,I have had a few chair floor mats in the past and ended up going without one. I recently got new carpeting with high pile and decided I should try to find one. After reading the reviews on Amazon I decided on this one and am extremely pleased that I did so. This is the nicest mat I have ever had. It was shipped quickly and arrived at my door well packaged. Worth every penny!
2,Update on previous review,"I wrote a review on this chair mat after I'd had it a while. I indicated that it seemed study and likely to last. I've now had it for two years, and it has multiple cracks. Shards of it have begun to stick up, and it will soon be in the trash. We did not mistreat it. I am now looking for another brand that might be thicker."
2,Rubbermaid plushmat chairmat,"I bought two of these. They look great! However, one is cracking badly, the other one is fine. In fact the one we are on the most is the one that is fine. I have been given Rubbermaid's phone number to see if they will replace it. These are too expensive not too last. I have only used ours about two months."
5,Love this potholder,"I really love the fact that the terrycloth is flexible, I can FEEL what I am touching and picking up. The size is not too large - where it can flop around - get in a sauce/get wet. These can be thrown in the washer 100's of times and the colors last for years of washing. They do not take up much room in a drawer - so you can have a whole stack of them if you wish. I have a 6 burner stove with 24 inch griddle and have used two or three at a time. I am a slob and can dirty them easily as I use them to sit casseroles, lids or pots on (as a hot plate)."
1,This listing is a fraud upon the people of UNITED STATES,"This product is NOT made in the USA like the listing states. It's basically a big fat lie. If you are looking for USA made like I was, you will be very disappointed. If I wanted an import I would have gone to Kohls, WalMart, Target... The ones I received were made in Turkey. --Could be worse, could have been made in China... WAKE UP AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Hostest with teh Mostest,"Love this item. Cannot believe it took me so long to purchase this, how did I ever rim glasses before????Hosting is now more convenient and my drinks are now better thanks to this!"
5,Margarita Time,Got this and the same day made good use of it. Impress your friends. I slowly am collecting bar stuff. A must have in any collection.
2,No Faireys please,"I thought the idea was a great one, but was very disappointed that he used a fairy to move the time traveller and kept the fairy thru the book. He could have done so much better. I was so looking forward to this and am bitterly disappointed at the waste of a great idea."
5,son of the sword,"Very enjoyable, combining present day misfortunes along with past adventures. Once started this book was hard to put down, finished it that day. My son picked it up, enjoyed it and knew I would also."
1,Reads like a textbook,"This book was very disappointing. The writing was juvenile, using thesame slang words over and over again. ""He bolted"", (as inleft, or ran, or walked away) became the novel's mantra. The historywas packed into the book, however,instead of using a writing talent tounfold the facts, they are explained in a textbook drone whilepresented as dialogue between characters. This book would probablyhave been fine for 5th or 6th grade reading class, except for the sexscenes, which were also written with a juvenile voice. Overall it wasa huge disappointment. Dry, boring, and tedious, with a need for athesarus. ... I was hoping for a fantasy, and got ajuvenile textbook about history in Scotland, that may or may not beaccurate."
1,"Another ""ca-ca""",Yes sir. This re-recordings are another 'basura'of Herman's Hermits. Why this guys has so many re-recordings?. You have to be very carefull when selecting what you want to buy it. I have thrown away two non-original HH CD.
2,Dissapointing - Very Out of Date & Too Technical,"I had high hopes for this book but to be honest it was deeply dissapointing. I'm no expert on HDV (that's why I bought the book) but it seems to me that this book is several years out of date - it only mentions the early HDV camcorders, and the chapters about editing don't seem to add up with what the industry magazines are saying about native editing. The general overview about HDV was useful, but I was lost when the commentary got overly technical."
1,Low quality rain gauge,"I purchased the Timex TX7003 plastic rain gauge about 10 months ago but it did not hold up or weather very well. The plastic base never fit properly and would constantly keep falling off the mounting unit that was mounted on the rail of my deck and finally cracked. Also the plastic became fogged from the weather and made it difficult to read. I have since replaced it with the Chaney Instrument 5-Inch Capacity Easy-Read Magnifying Rain Gauge and like this one much better. More rugged, easier to read and appears to be accurate."
2,Displeased,"We purchased 2 of these rain gauges which were touted to be easy to read. They turned out to be harder to read than the rain gauge we were replacing which made no such claim. They arrived in undamaged packaging but 1 of the 2 gauges was already cracked when it was packed/shipped. The one that survived seems adequate, but we would not buy the same product again."
4,Attractive but a little hard to read.,Good value for a nice looking rain gauge. This would get five stars from me if it were easier to read the measurement. With the measurements being printed on the back side of the gauge it can be hard to see through to what the reading is.
3,rain gage,I don't like as well as another that I purchased at the same time for less than half the cost
1,Rain gauge,"This rain gauge was purchased to replace an older model of the same overall design put out by Brookstones. The old one gave comparable readings to other stations around me. On checking the results from the two placed side by side, the new Timex model gave readings at least 50% too high. In addition, the markings for the fractions of the first inch are too widely spaced and a lot of shower-type rain falls into this category in this area of Texas in summer.P.B. Dallas, TX"
2,Works good for a couple of months,I've tried to use this same gauge 3 times. All 3 resulted in an item which broke. It suffers from direct sunlight. And therefore becomes very fragile and yellowed. One unit had the base you stick in the ground fall off. Overall I give up on this. I should have bought a better unit in the first place.
2,Arrived opened and broken,"When I received the rain gauge the item had been opened and re-taped shut. Which would be fine if I purchased a used item, but this rain gauge is described as ""new."" The rain gauge was also broken when I opened it. I'm not sure if it was damaged in transit or if it was used, damaged, and repackaged. Either way there's no point returning it as it would cost more to ship it back to Amazon than it cost, but I am disappointed that they are selling what appears to be a used product as new."
1,It's no good,"I bought this rain gauge excited to use it about a year ago. It came with a small crack at the top that I paid no mind to because it was a quarter of an inch at the top, and I didn't see a reason to send it back. I don't think the crack has had any effect on the effectiveness of gauging the rain.Here is my problem with it. It is properly mounted on a fence with no obstruction to the mouth (it's opening is above the fence line). The problem is that every time a light gust of wind in the storms blows the gauge out of the holster. I think it has effectively worked 6 or 7 times in all the storms I have had in my area over the last year. I have even seen it blow off, walked out in the rain set it back up, and returned after the storm to see it back on the ground. This is a major disappointment."
1,weird,Increments of 1/8ths instead of 1/10ths.weirdI question the accuracy of this gauge.Needs more testing in actual rain to determine accuracy.
2,First freeze broke it,The plastic cracked the first time it froze with water in it. It now leaks and is useless. Lasted about 2 months.
3,Does the job,"For the price, this is a perfectly fine rain gauge. Very easy to setup; two screws and you're done. The only drawback is the assembly quality. The base and glass are not aligned. Thus, the glass tube is cantered at an angle. It still catches rain, but I would have preferred the gauge to stand straight. For less than $3, delivered to my door, I can't really complain."
3,Three eighths ??????????,"I purchased 2 of these, they work fine. Strange that they are marked in 1/8th inch increments not tenths.Odd."
4,Hard to beat for $3,"Nice rain gauge. Have not had a chance to see it in action just yet. Yes, it's plastic so time will tell about durability and whether it will get cloudy. But I looked around for a rain gauge and in So Cal they're not so easy to come by. For a paltry $3 this darn fits the bill. Shipping would cost more than the item if it weren't for Amazon Prime."
1,NOT calibrated in tenths of an inch,"The scale to measure amount of rainfall shows each 1/2 inch. BUT the scale in between each 1/2 inch IS NOT calibrated to each 1/10 of an inch as all other English measure gauges are. There are only 3 lines instead of the 4 there should be to measure tenths between 1/2 inches. That means each line represents 0.125 inches. I bought and put up 2 of these. At $2.99 seemed like a good deal on a simple accurate rain gauge. At first rain I figured out the incorrect scale. Not properly calibrated, it's worth $0."
2,"Jerry, te queremos mucho, pero...","Jerry, si estas leyendo esto:Creo que todos estamos de acuerdo en decir que eres un cantante excepcional. Te queremos mucho!!! Pero queremos que vuelvas a cantar salsa, como la del tiempo de ""Cuenta Conmigo"", ""Cara de Nino"", y ""Magia""... No te dejes influenciar por la musica que esta de moda hoy, el reggaeton no te va!!! No me malinterpretes: hasta tu disco ""Vuela muy alto"" me encanto, pero creo que ahora es tiempo de volver a la musica que mejor te queda. Seguire escuchando tus discos de salsa anteriores hasta que vuelvas a sacar uno nuevo. Vamos, por favor, te lo rogamos!!!Te quiere tu fan DJ LOLA, desde Montreal, Canada."
2,Basura,"Ni se molesten en comprar esta basura, no sirve, nada que ver, El problema es el siguiente aunque ya sabemos que el quiere cantar pop en vez de salsa no es la primera vez que lo hace y a tenido mucho exito con los otros cds anteriores pero este desde que comienza la lirica de las canciones como que no riman, el ritmo tampoco ayuda, el disco anterior si que era un disco tenia salsa y pop como este. El anterior le da 20 patas a este,al parecer el cambio los arreglistas si me gusta como una o dos canciones es mucho ( boricua siempre sere y sobre tu piel) tanta espera para nada..........."
1,Stick to Salsa Jerry,Jerry you sound so good singing salsa. Why do you do this to your fans?? I was very disappointed with this CD. There are only 3 salsa tracks. No vale la pena comprarlo.
5,The only source for accurate transcriptions,"A great collection for any guitar-playing Who fan. The songs ae transcribed in the correct key which allows playing along with the original songs. I have been extremely happy with all of the Hal Leonard books that I have purchased. The only problem I have had is that the some of the pages have become detached from holding the books wide open when reading.I haven't played every single song in these books, but I haven't seen any of the errors that the other reviewer is referring to in the songs that I have learned."
4,Always You - A different but excellent splash of remixes,"This single starts off with the amazing Groove Brothers Remix. They really hit it off with an awesome remix of ""Always You"". But the bass beats could stand out more. Gotta love Hex's well-done job on her song also. Awesome!!!"
4,Cruise Scenic South America,I purchased this DVD to give to my clients who were going on a South American Cruise. All the ports they would be stopping at were on this DVD.The information given on the DVD was excellent. I highly recommend purchasing it if you are travelling to South America or as a gift for someone who is.
2,"Okay present, probably would not buy for self","Picture is good but a little grainy, the screen covering is glossy, not matte like other players. Viewing angle is good, two kids can share but as other review noted two headphone ports on one side can be difficult for sharing. I bought an extender cable so the twins could share easier. Heavier than I thought, not really ideal for one handed use. Very strange there are no built in speakers, would have been nice to have. Battery life ok, but couldn't make it through Lord of the Rings Extended Edition. Speaker base seems cheap, more weight would be nice. Screen scratches already visible after 3 weeks' use, bought Fellowes WriteRight screen protectors and cut to fit. A little expensive and some compromises but a fun toy to keep the kids quiet."
1,nice look not very useful,"I had this player for six months. It has nice one piece design, harder for kids to break, picture is fine and commands handy. The problem - it doesn't play 50% of DVD's. Disks from Blockbuster, brand new one straight from the box, DVD's burned on my PC. It doesn't discriminate; about every other disk wouldn't play. Message, ""Unknown Disk"" sits on it while you are driving your wining kid around.For $300 it should do much better job. I think this is one of those Sony products actually made by no name Chinese manufacture and Sony just put label on it."
4,Creepy as HELL :-),"This collection of Stephen King videos has kept me hooked for hours in front of the TV.OF the four series that this collection contains, ""Storm of the century""( 2 DVDs) and ""Red Rose"" ( 2 DVDs) somehow overshadows the other 2. With these 4 in the collection along with ""Shinning"", you can have a great collection of scarry and out of the world videos. Moreover buying these 4 together in this collection is cheaper for my wallet too :-)"
1,"beware, bad live recording","This looks like yet another release of a very bad live recording that has been going around being issued in 9 or 10 song format. As of today there is no track list, but on CD Universe they do list the track list. Please see Red Hot and Live, Respect Yourself, or many other titles with this same track list and a different label on all of these recordings. This concert had the potential of being great. Etta sounds good and the songs are good, but all of the tracks fade out before the song if finshed. I highly suspect due to the various reissues of this that it may not be a legit recording. Avoid this at all cost."
3,who knew?,"The Queen of Technicolor doesn't come off nearly as pretty in black & white print--and in her own words, no less.Fiery, fiesty and strong-willed? Definitely? Difficult, self-sabotaging and possibly paranoid? Well, judge for yourself. According to O'Hara, Walt Disney cursed her on his deathbed, John Ford somehow squelched her Oscar nomination (even though the votes were already in--and she was to be nominated for a Ford picture!), a cinematographer deliberately photographed her badly because he didn't like the sports team she was rooting for(!!)--and on and on.A bad marriage, a Broadway flop, a failed movie comeback--everything's always someone else's fault. Such a delightful presence onscreen, it's too bad her messy personal life was mostly one battle after another."
4,Was she tough or not?,"I did enjoy this book though it left me ambivalent. Was John Ford really that terrible person? Why she repeatedly says ""I am a tough Irishwoman"", but often behaves just opposite ways? I agree that sometimes she does show a lot of courgage, but why didn't she punch John Ford on the nose?Perhaps it is impossible to understand the power of the studios. It was difficult to give up reading this book; so it must be good."
3,Another Big Ego,"It seems that most actresses should wait for someone to write their biography instead of taking on the task themselves. This is one more ""big ego"" event that becomes very tedious. Most of the info is interesting. It simply should have been told by someone else who could put a more realistic view on the pages."
2,Hum....,"For a strong a fiesty woman as Ms. O'Hara claimed herself to be, I found myself constantly shaking my head at her actions. There was definitely a lot of dysfunction in her relationships to the point it annoyed me. Also, I sensed her having sour grapes. I was finding many of the things she said hard to believe and I was turned off about the way she threw in negative comments about others who could not defend themselves. I would say my experience with this book was a frustrating read. Now Ava Gardner's book I found to be honest and entertaining. Ava sounds to me more the woman that Maureen was trying to depict. I didn't at all see the woman Maureen saw in herself."
4,What a strong lady,"I am not sure Maureen O'hara would ever be thought of as a sweet lady. What I took from this book is that she loved with all her heart and those she loved knew it. Those she did not felt her wrath. I do appreciate how she stood up for what she believed in. Too many of Hollywood elite go for what is popular leaving all morality behind. It was fun to live through the Golden Age of Hollywood through her eyes. I had so much fun reading about the movies I had enjoyed over the years. I love anything Irish, it brings my Grandfather back. I could hear the accent I loved through Maureen's words. If you are a fan you will enjoy this book. If not you could learn a lot. This was well written and I enjoyed each word. I hope she does leave to 102 as she wishes."
5,Couldn't Put IT Down,"'Tis Herself - is a wonderful read for anyone interested in Miss O'Hara or in the ""Old"" Hollywood when stars were STARS."
4,'Tis Herself: An Autobiography,I enjoyed reading this book. It is also hard to realize that show business was as rough an industry as it was. I found it hard to put it down. I found it a very honest recount of her life and of others.
5,Tis herself,What is her real name? How old is she? How many children does she have? How she feels about the people who she works with? All is told in this book?
2,'tis unfortunate,"'Tis unfortunate that many of the people in Ms. O'Hara's book are not alive--thus unable to either dispute or to prove a good number of her assertions. Although much of the biography does evoke the era of ""contract players Hollywood,"" much does have a false or hollow ring. For a woman who seemed very determined and ""aware,"" being trapped in a horrible, abusive marriage for so long seems a bit far-fetched! Also, from what I've read in the past, Gertrude Lawrence had ALWAYS been set for The King and I!!! Maybe one day, we'll get an O'Hara film bio-pic starring Marni Nixon!!!"
5,Tis Herself,"Don't miss this opportunity to become acquainted with Maureen FitzSimons Blair (aka Maureen O'Hara) in her absolutely wonderful autobiography ""Tis Herself"". She is one strong, talented, feisty Irishwoman who lets us in on her charmed life. Follow Maureen on her journey--from her beginnings in Ranelagh, Ireland, her motion picture career in the Golden Age of Hollywood and beyond, her disastrous and abusive marriage, to at last finding her ""gradh ma croidhe"", Charlie Blair, only to encounter heartbreak once again. Maureen handles every chapter of this book like she handles her life - HEAD ON. I absolutely adore Maureen O'Hara, and this book is a treasure for her fans and those who are just discovering Herself. No one will be disappointed with this read."
3,Interesting and surprisingly sad,"It was interesting to read about the humble beginnings and rise to fame of Maureen O'Hara, but I was surprised at how someone who considers herself to be strong and independent could be so naive when it came to real life. Perhaps she made good choices with her career, but her personal life was one dumb decision after another. While I felt sorry for the predicaments she got into, I also thought she did a huge disservice to herself and her daughter by becoming a bystander in her life. If the old hollywood interests you this will be a great book, but be ready to want to shake O'Hara a few times."
3,Ok,I don't remember getting this and I have not read it so I can't really tell you anything about it
1,This dvd really bites !!!,"This vid is only 18 minutes and shows you nothing !! If I wanted to know how to color inside the lines, I would have bought a how to coloring book. All he shows is how to shave and clean the area. The tattoos are already there. Stay away from this one."
3,A Rare Look At Rare Films,"First, the title ""House of a 1000 Women"" appears to be incorrect. IMDB shows it as ""Two Thousand Women"". All that aside, an interesting look at English women interred in France by the Germans. Whether that actually happened or not, I'm not sure, but if it did, I'm sure the women would act as did these in the film.Secondly, ""Hitler Dead or Alive"" is a hoot! Plain and simple. Ward Bond does a great job. Even thought the story is ridiculous, the viewers in 1943 would have loved it!Bottom line, this DVD is worth adding to your collection if you appreciate period films of WWII."
4,Sound great.,"The mounting bracket has these rubber things on the end so that I can't torque down on them, but for the most part they seem solid. I would prefer a solid screw down as I have them mounted in a enclosed trailer, but this may be a non issue as time will tell. If it is an issue a washer will fix it. They sound great and the connections for the wires are of good quality. Actually everything seems to be of good quality. A good purchase."
5,This book is so helpful!,"Now that I've read about Brilliance Marketing, I finally have a real focus and purpose to my small business marketing strategy. Instead of paying too much attention to what our competitors are doing, we are focusing on our own brilliance and we are already seeing results! I can tell that this is a book that I will be reading over and over."
5,great short stories,"These stories will give some insight into Truman's young life. I read the book from cover to cover and really like the later stories best, but they are all good. Enjoy"
3,"Beautifully written, but not my cup of tea","Maybe I just have issues with the genre. Short stories can be unsatifying when they are left open ended. I am sure this is meant to leave us with a ""what happened next?"" feeling and that's supposed to be intriguing, but I just find it frustrating. But there is no denying that Capote's writing is vivid, beautiful and engrossing. He creates poetry from the mundane and perfectly captures the pathos and subtleties of the human condition."
3,Capote the Limited,"Capote is bad when he writes about poor people. He's alright when he writes about rich people. He's extraordinary when he writes about himself. His ""complete short stories"" attempt all three. However good his style is, sentence for sentence, avoid the stories that suck. Because they suck. Read Capote when he's himself, and avoid him when he's masquerading."
1,What are you getting?,Why would anyone purchase this product when there is absolutely no description of how much and in what form is the bilberry tea you are ordering?
5,It just keeps getting better and better,"Ok so Cartmans voice changes, big deal, this season still kicks butt. The Russel Crowe episode is hillarious! Pay no attention to those losers who gave this DVD a bad review simply because they cant take a joke. They need to develop a sense of humor or find something else to do with their time besides sitting in their parents basement writing stupid comments online all day. IF YOU DONT LIKE IT DONT WATCH IT! I dont need to hear you b#%$@ and complain! Hippies"
3,funny,"southpark is great, but this dvd is censored. and thus 2 stars are taken away with no pre warning of such.Commentary is uncensored. makes lots of sense eh?"
5,south park season six,Great price and fast shipping. The dvd's were in great shape and were a great price.
1,Dont buy,"The product did arrive on time, however, the product is NOT new as stated. It was cellophane wrapped by the seller. The episode guide is missing, the disks are damaged, and I was NOT satisfied at all."
4,"Great season, usual poor ""Special Features""...","This is one of my favorite SP seasons...Stone and Parker finally ditched the tired, unfunny Kenny gag and brought in Butters. If you love the Butters character as I do, this is the season for you.Lots of bad taste and edgy humor in this season. Subway Jared loves eatin' ""sammiches"" and thinks ""everyone should have aides"". The Simpson get ripped on, or maybe paid homage, funny episode either way. The infamous Lord of the Rings parody where Butters turns into Gollum under the influence of a misplaced porno tape. Jesus Christ Action Star. And on and on. This is a great season!I deduct one star though, because the special features are even worse than usual. Many episodes don't even have mini-commentaries. Comedy Central needs to do better on this, until they do, I'm more inclined to just TIVO the episodes and forget about shelling out for the DVDs."
4,Lemmi-Lemmi-Lemmiwinks!,"Lemmiwinks rules! If you havent seen ""The Death Camp of Tolerance"" on this DVD you dont know what I`m talking about! That, The Simpsons episode, The Lord of the Rings, and the Rusell Crowe show make this one of South Park`s best seasons. And I`ve seen most of them."
3,It gets worse after this.,"This the season where Cartman's voice gets less funny, and where the plots get weaker. BTW, Matthew Hollman, or whatever your name is, your not funny, and the whole ""We have to defend Bush no matter what"" thing is getting old."
3,Preordering will delay any other items if you are using the free shipping option,I just cancelled a preorder on this as it was holding up 2 other items with 24 hour delivery. I noticed after 10 days that all 3 items were scheduled for october delivery. Put this on your wish list or order separately.
2,cant be used if you dont have the right computer,it sucks if you dont have a windows. i tried use a mac and dell but it didnt work.:(better if you watch it on tv though

1,Cheaply Made,"I am very dissapointed with this backgammon set. I figured for $33.00 It would be well built. The triangles are offcenter on one side of the board, so that the chips do not sit how they should. The bottom of one of the shakers fell off the first time we used it. There was glue on the inside of the handle making it sticky. Do not waste your money on this backgammon set."
5,painting more animals on rocks,"Super, these books by Ms. Wellford are illustrated so beautifully that ANYONE could paint animals and such on rocks. Her directions are not only the written word, but also demonstrated by showing the drawing from the stones to use, preparing the stones, sketching from ""square one"" on thru the completed reproduction. These books are a MUST for any rock painter enthusiast."
4,I liked it.,Lin Wellford writes excellent how to books. I have read how to books in which you feel that there is a step missing because your project doesn't quite come out right. Not so with a Lin Wellford book! This one covers a wide range of pets.
1,This archos 404 case needs be improved,I like this case's size and image. However it is really needs to be improved. All the holes cannot match the button. The mic and camara has no holes at all. I want to return this case but I am afraid of the procedure of returning. So I spent hours to enlarge and cut the holes by myself. The case is good for use now but it looks so urgly after the manuly cut. Hopefully the design can be improved soon. It is not a difficult thing for the manufacture but it is very hard for the consumer to cut and shape the holes to match the camera's function parts.
5,The real Swan Lake experience..,"Watching this made me feel exactly like I was in the Theatre/Theater in Covent Garden and having seen this production there a few years back, it was as close to the real live production as possible, from the warming up sounds coming from the orchestra pit, to the audience reactions, to the real effort put in by the dancers for an absolutely first rate version of this beautiful ballet. If you don't feel like a trip to the Theatre/Theater but want the most realistic Swan Lake experience possible, then this is for you. The production itself is the the best I've seen and the principals are superhuman in their achievements. For the novice this introduction to Tchaivosky's music being brought alive by the ballet is perfect, as Swan Lake has so many recognisible scores."
5,Excellent! A must for all Swan Lake fans.,"The most beautiful performance of this classical title. Natalia Makarova and Anthony Dowell not only performed excellently but also emotionally. Emotion between the two lovers is the fundamental element in such a romantic story but it has almost been forgotten by other dancers, including the famous Fonteyn and Nureyev. Fortunately in this video, besides ice-cold, purely technical performance, the real emotion prevades. I hope Kultur video can make this wonderful performance on the DVD in the near future."
3,It is what it is,"There is so little visual record of Makarova. I saw her perform live many times. Unfortunate grainy picture and someone else mentioned that feet iare frequently cut off for the corps. Very odd. Still, if you want to see Makarova, here is your chance. It took me a while to be able to sit through the poor quality DVD but ended up being worth it."
2,Poor recording quality.,"I loved the performance, and It was such a great experience to compare decent swan lake ballet to this video (which created 30 years ago). However, It was shame to see the poor quality of the recording. It seems like they just convert the old video tape to DVD with no technology. There is no revision of the visual quality, and also the right side of the video has a stretch mark created from the poor recording method."
3,I recommend the DVD of the Swedish Ballet as First Choice,"All that I might have said has been well presented by those who ranked this performance two or three stars. I am sellling off my copy of this Royal Ballet DVD - not that it's a bad production at all but that it is over-rated and rather bland.I highly recommend the performance by the Swedish Ballet as a first choice keeper.Tchaikovsky: Swan LakeIt is gripping it its drama, the sets establish a mood but do not call attention to themselves, and the emotional commitment of everyone involved is clearly profound. And oh yes, the dancing and the acting (it is a story ballet, after all) are superb, and the orchestral playing if not better in execution is certainly better in recorded sound."
4,A Great Way to Tell the Story of Swan Lake,"This is an outstanding performance by the Royal Ballet. The Royal Ballet is one of my absolute favorite ballet combanies. Makarova is phenominal. Her Odette is so dramatic and is filled with passion. On the other hand, her Odile is creepy. A perfect Odile in my opinion: wicked and bewitching.I especially loved Makarova's facial expressions during the Adagio in act one. They were so dramatic and filled with passion. It was as if Makarova dedicated herself to her role. Like Fonteyn, she can act as well as dance. I recommend this ballet to anyone who loves ballet and romance. It's a great ballet."
2,Swan Lake DVD,"While the perfomance and music were captivating, the technical quality of the DVD was terrible. Images were ""soft"" and had a distinct ""digital"" quality. It appeared to me that the DVD was a digital conversion of a poor quality video tape.I would not recommend purchase of this particular DVD if a visually satisfying experience is desired."
3,Bizet - Carmen Ballet,"Dear people,Being a brand new customer, please forgive me for having a little problem cruising through your site. The above mentioned ballet is really not what I expected ...it's more modern while I'm classical type. I've been trying to find the way to exchange this particular DVD for ""Sleeping Beauty"" but don't know how to go about. Can anyone help?????"
2,Code Check Electrical Is Not Up To Date With 96 OR 99 CODE,"What a disappointment! This is a well laid out book with great illustrations. However, despite its ""1999"" publishing date, it does not cover changes in the 1996 or 1999 National Electric Code. The book makes no claim that it is up to date but it certainly is implied. As a loose leaf publication, it seems all the publisher would have to do is supplement pages with current data."
5,love it!,So beutiful made! pics are awsome! ages 2-4 - my son is 4 and he love it! He is too big for alfabet books - but he still enjoing Kipper the dog. Nicely made and good quality! Very good book for beginer readers. Its not much words - but they all colorful and nead!
5,Cute!,Very cute book! My 2-year old son is a Kipper fan and he loves this book! Hopefully it will help us with learning the ABC's!
3,Hardcover binding doesn't hold up.,"My 2 year old son loves the Kipper videos, so we thought we would buy him a Kipper book. The text and illustrations are great - cute and fun, and for fans of Kipper, they don't disappoint. We thought it would be better to pay extra for the hardcover version, thinking it would last longer. However, after 2 weeks of use, the binding has fallen apart, and we can't get the pages back in. Also, my son was not the one handling the book, only his parents, so we know that it wasn't used in a rough manner. Save your money and buy the paperback."
4,"Nice, but...","A really nice book that covers each letter of the alphabet. It has easy-to-read large print and clean, tidy drawings of some of the familiar Kipper characters (mainly Kipper and Arnold).My only objection is that the edition I have has some Americanisms, like ladybug, instead of ladybird (I suppose because the publisher, Red Wagon Books, an imprint of Harcourt, is US-based). That doesn't go with the very English Kipper of the animated series. But aside from that, it's a lovely book."
4,Rock and Roll for the new millenium,"In short, this album ROCKS! With a good dose of indie-ness and (admittedly) SOME Thom Yorke-esque vocal stylings, this is one you can crank all the way through and get some nice, ripping results. What's really great is that the album has a nice, polished quality that you'd expect from a band with a couple of studio releases under its belt. The genius of the album lies within the band's ability to create a powerful wall of sound while never simply ""making noise."" You gotta dig the guitar heroics. This album is also a decent representation of the band live, although the energy the band plays with is an inspiring sight to see. In my opinion, they're one of the best groups based out of Atlanta. If you dig indie rock and roll, get this album. But if you're within earshot, go hear this band shred. You will not be disappointed!"
5,A tool that does what it says.,"I have just used this for laying wall tile and it works well. It seems sturdy and well made. However, it is long so needs to be protected and carefully transported. It would have been useful if it came in two pieces. Overall, a good buy."
3,McLafferty MS Interpretation book,"Written by this well known professor and expert on mass spectral interpretation, it was purchased for use at work where we use MS every day. You need to understand mass spec well for it to be of good use. It is not an easy read though."
4,mclafferty's mass spec book,"Pretty good, good examples, explanations of problems are quite good. In chapter reading sometimes hard to follow. Concise. A must read for anyone learning mass spec"
3,Beginners text,"A good introduction to classical mass spectrometry though most of the recent developments in the field are not covered. Most suitable for undergraduates. This edition corrects some of the organizational blunders in earlier forms ; previously a chapter on ""Other Ionization Techniques"" included sections on negative ions and icrs (?)."
2,Flimsy,This product is very flimsy as everyone else has describes and i was expecting a perfect fit for my Joyce Chen Wok but it has gaps around the edges
3,Product Details are WRONG,"Product DetailsProduct Dimensions: 14 x 14 x 6.5 inchesI know that a 14 inch wok normally takes a 13 inch lid, BUT THE PRODUCT list the dimensions as 14 inches not 13 inches"
1,Terrible Shipping,I wasn't as unhappy with the product as I was with the way it was shipped to me. Being that the lid was only $10 I was not expecting much in terms of quality. The issue is that the lid was placed in a box with no packaging material and ended up getting bent and dented in shipping. So much so that it was not usable. A few dents would have been upsetting but this was unacceptable. See images for a picture of what I received.
1,cheaply made,cheaply made. not what I was expecting considering the quality of the wok. They need to offer another lid choice of similar quality to the wok itself
3,Love it,It is a little on the thin side but it really works well. It is dishwasher safe and does it's job flawlessly.
5,Fits perfectly,This lid fits the Joyce Chen Wok we purchased. It seems strange to us to purchase the lid separately. It serves the purpose for which we purchased it.
1,Poorly Made,The lapels on this jacket are unevenly cut and do not look right. Even after the jacket is pressed they will not lay flat and stick up in a wrinkled and rumpled manner. Not sure if this is a knockoff or something that slipped thru quality control.
3,Disappointing,"""Hands on History"" is a wonderful idea. Children truly enjoy projects that make history real to them. This book, however, was disappointing. While the projects were fine, the material presented in the book is very ""dumbed-down"" for the 9-12 age group and I was bewildered that the author would call slaves ""African Americans"". Also, the amazon.com summary talks about an introduction to the Indians in the colonies. There is no mention of them in this particular book. This is covered in the series. Look for a book with more substance than this book and one that hasn't thrown in political correctness to blur history. Rodica Prato, I certainly didn't find your cover illustration to be ""washed out""."
3,"Good, but not exactly as appears",These cups are very sturdy and look to be of good quality however the picture is a bit deceptive. The picture shows the cup with the wicks/tabs included and they are not. Just be aware!
5,Pure Genius,I just love this book. The story is great. They pictures are a joy. The rhyming is wonderful. I highly recommend this book.
5,Works great,"All I got to say is works like a charm. Installation isn't too hard! Really replaced the old one, which was rusty and falling apart."
2,Prometheus extended review,At first I didn't realize it was just a extended review...I thought it was the movie. I was very dissappointed to find it was a trailer - teaser. I have better things to do than tease myself. I did not like it!
2,What a disappointment.,"Being a Sci-Fi fan for many years, I knew that really good Sci-Fi movies are few and far between. Still, Prometheus sounded promising, perhaps in the way the original ""2001"" was. Alas, from a pretty good opening it went rapidly downhill, reaching a point where the only reason to finish watching it was the good graphics and technical effects.It is amazing that so much money can be spent on making such a movie, while tolerating a goofy and implausible plot. The actors were OK, but the plot must have been aimed at the 14-year-old-boy crowd that most current movies are aimed at."
3,Let Down,Maybe we're all spoiled but what I see in movies is great special affects and the writing or story or acting simply isn't their. The directing was great but then I never got drawn into the story or characters at all. The end is just crummy as you can get and makes no sense in context with the rest of the story.I was so looking forward to this and then...who cares was my conclusion and watching it a second time would be a total waste to me.
3,More Prometheus,Without giving away the movie. The action could have started along time ago before it did. I loved the twist at the end. I loved the subtle role of the captain and how he added to the ending's twist.I loved the special effects. I want more Prometheus. I want a part 2 to make up for what part 1 lacked.
4,Get ready!,The preview gave me an excellent idea about what I was getting into when I chose to watch this movie. Well done!
2,HUH?,"I honestly said ""What the hell did I just watch?"" I love the original Alien and am a big fan of all the movies and this was a must watch. I didn't understand a thing that was happening in the movie! I watched it in theaters when released and am planning on renting it to watch again to see if I can make sense of what I just watched. Special effects are awesome and maybe next time around I will enjoy the film more. Was really hoping for a little more Alien action....hope this doesnt spoil anything if you have not seen movie."
5,"awesome, sneak preview","The preview does the main movie justice. I would love to tell you how it ends, but then everyone would hate me.. LOL and that's not such a good thing."
5,Great movie,"I'm a big fan of the Alien franchise and this movie doesn't disappoint, it's got twists and turns, amazing special effects, interesting questions, high-tech toys and a tough heroine or two. Unfortunately it left me with more questions than answers regarding the storyline, here's hoping there's a sequel!!"
4,Looks like another conspiracy.,"Being a fan of the original ""Alien""/""Aliens"", this looks like it will survive the critics and add to the lasting legacy. The preview looks like another setup for a big business conspiracy."
2,Hard to tell,"Sorry, but it was hard to tell what this film was really about due to the choppy way it streamed into my PC. So, it is clear that to utilize these streaming features be sure to have a faster internet connection or it may appear choppy which is very annoying and not a way to enjoy a movie!"
1,Beginning half good (not great) last half awful,"This started off promising, and I kept waiting for it to get better, but it only got worse until it took a real dive toward the end. THUMBS DOWN"
1,not my pick,"My huz picked this movie and after seeing previews, I could care less about watching it. I bought it for him."
3,Quick,This is quick and to the point. There is not much else to say about it. I am glad they made the preview an option.
3,star search,"it did show alot of one of the stars, and I think she is great but,it didnt show enough of a broad exciteing synopsis to get me very interested. I will watch it when it comes out on pay-per-view, but not the expense of seeing it at a theatre."
2,I'll perhaps watch the movie.,This extended trailer does not inspire me to watch this movie. What I viewed seemed a bit flat as a story.
1,Couldn't get it to play!,"After I downloaded the preview, to THREE different machines, I couldn't get it to play! The file was intact, just not operating.As it was free, I lost only some time, but what a bummer for it not to work."
3,Average,"A really interesting movie but would been much better if we didn't have to wait for reloading so often, we have high speed Verizon fios and felt like we were using dial up connection."
3,Prometheus not that great,"I'll give it 3 stars, it was okay but for all the hype it just fell flat. No clue to who the engineers were, an idea that they were creating a weapon, maybe. No idea why they created humanity, disjointed, worth a rental not worth a buy."
1,Title not yet shipped!!!,"I am unable to review this movie at this time, since amazon.com has not shipped it to me yet. I think this is a cart before the horse scenario. I will be happy to submit a review once I actually receive the movie."
2,Mmmm Not So Great,Save your money. In our opinion this movie was a waste of time and money. Even the self guided C-section was a yawn.
4,"Interesting, but",The preview was a good come on. Is it enough to make me want to buy the movie. Not quite. What comes after they land? A glimpse into the surface action would be helpful.
4,Good Preview,Short previews don't give enough info to make a determination about a movie; and some give away the whole movie (the best parts of it). This one gives a good sense of the movie and lead to my purchase of the movie.
4,A good show for tech people.,"A nice movie for sci-fi geeks with good effects and story line. Not to be rated like many others, but yet still good."
3,Got me interested,The extended preview gave me a feel for the movie and got me interested enough that I rented it. Good to have a little more info then just trying to get a feel from the short trailers.
2,Not Good,It is worth the rental and that is about it. I am glad I did not go to the theatre to see it.
1,Very disappointed,"This recording starts out with lovely music. Then towards the middle there are many pauses and interruptions in the recording. I returned my first one and got a replacement. However, the replacement was even worse. It had pauses and interruptions even before the midpoint of the recording. I returned it and got a refund."
2,Not For Weak Knees,"I found the pace too fast to follow the complicated dance-like movements. There are frequent,fast, rotational-type movements that are not good for the knees. May be a good workout for those with dance experience, but it is too complicated (and ineffective due to the effort lost from missing steps) for those of us who never had formal dance training."
3,"Great for abs, NOT for buns","I tried this because i Wanted a DVD, not VHS, but just ordered another copy of buns of steel with greg smithy on VHS. I almost don't want to give away the secret, but greg has much much better and intense bun excersises than this workout could ever offer. All Robin does is sway her head back and forth and say ""come on"" while she just does squats over and over and over. Watch out for your knees because you could injure them if you do lunge after lunge at this pace. The number one thing with targeting muscles is form, not quantity, she doesn't go over form! Greg Smithy does go over form and he really targets the inner working of your buns and gets rid of cellulite. and he does floor excersises that isolate muscles. If you want thighs like a transvestite than do these lunges all day. If you want a nice [...] than do Greg Smithy's tape.Abs on this are good though, so i don't totally regret the purchase"
3,Target Tonimg: Buns and Abs of Steel,"I guess it was a good work out over all, but its NOT for beginners. I'm in pretty good shape I just needed to tone up a little and this work out is hard-core. I couldn't do more more then 5 minutes at a time. Maybe that's just me, but I wouldn't recamend it to anyone starting out."
5,Great abs workout,I bought the dvd because I wore out the Abs Of Steel video tape. I haven't even watched the other workout on the dvd but just for the abs workout alone it is worth it. It has a lot of great exercises which I prefer rather than doing a ton of situps.
1,Disappointed!,"I own Abs and Buns of Steel 2000 on VHS, so when I bought this series I expected to have an exercise video of the same quality. I was very disappointed to not break a sweat ontop of being physically confused when it came to the positions. Steel series could have done a way better job."
5,Great deal!,"Got a great deal on this item coupled with the Jane Fonda 3 set DVD workout. In fact, it was under $30 plus shippping. Very great deal, great DVDs, I'm extremely pleased."
2,short,I thought this was a novel but it's actually a short poem. It's probably of interest to Natalie Babbit fans only.
5,Fast and reliable!,"Okay, first off I had an old old old cd burner in which it took hours to complete one cd. After hours and hours of research in finding the best new cd burner out there, I came across this fast and reliable device. When I finally received my TDK CD-RW drive and I was amazed at how easy and fast this thing burned my cds. There were no errors, considering the fact that it was writing at an amazing 52X. I burned 4 cds within 5 mins!! Not only that, it comes with a software that you can add crossfading option. In case you dont know what that is, it is a program where it will burn individual tracks and fade it too the next track to make it more of a continuous mix. Simply a great buy. I totally recommend this product."
4,Great Info Taken with A Grain of Salt,"This is a great book, but must be used with common ""mommy"" sense. Some of the things in the book will go against what your pediatrician will recommend, and thats fine, but you need to make a choice based on both sources of wonderful information to decide what is best for your child.One thing that did really bother me is that there is a recipe for teething that involves honey-honey should NEVER be given to an infant under one year of age because it can be potentialy deadly. And since most babies begin teething between 6-9 months I was a bit upset that this risk was not mentioned.The information on making infusions, oils and the like is great though. I would recommend the book to anyone who has common sense about herbs and has a desire to raise a child without the use of a lot of man made medicines."
3,"Extensive information, but not great for a beginner","I was looking for a book that would give me some basic information on natural remedies for my baby. This book has been OK, but if I was really to follow it I would have to invest in building an entire cupboard of herbs and extracts, something I'm really not ready for.For example, the remedy for the common cold involves combining up to 8 herbs/extracts, none of which I have or even have heard of. It is very detailed information, but too much for someone who is not ready to dive into the deep end of natural remedies."
5,Informative Book,"Mary Bove provides a well written, informative guide to using herbs for many common children's ailments. She addresses dosing differences for children compared to adults and ways to help get children to take herbs by making them taste good."
2,Strange recipes,"I expected to find ways of natural healing with common household ingredients, items. Instead, there were many natural healing recipes with very strange herbs & ingredients that I think are hard to find. It wasn't what I expected."
5,doll underwear,"This is a cute accessory for the doll, but it is rather girly, and I bought it for my son's boy doll. The trim on the set makes it look like girl clothes, even though the description does not say girls. Other than that, they are well made and easy to put on."
2,"Very cute, but....","...does not keep accurate time. Either there is a problem with the mechanism or the battery, which shouldn't be the case. Overpriced for faulty quality."
4,Great Vamp love story,"This was my second purchase of Nina Bangs books. And like the first book, I loved them both. Excellent read."
2,Not as good as others out there,"I have read a couple of Bangs' other works but they did not disappoint me as much as this one. I will admit that I like fluffy romance and I love paranormal romance especially. I am usually able to suspend my disbelief enough for those that don't reach the level of Laurell Hamilton, Anne Rice, and Donna Boyd. Unfortunately, this book doesn't even come close. It is too whimsical, too unbelievable, and I agree with many other reviewers that there is no depth to the characters. I didn't even find Sparkle and Ganymede entertaining in this one. They were just annoying. Perhaps it is solely this work because I read another one of hers and wasn't compelled to write a bad review. So if you are going to try Bangs for the first time, then pick up something else of hers."
4,"Nice size, fit, and storage - but wheels don't last long enough.","Best features: One of the few roller cases that fits nicely under the airplane seat, and yet it holds plenty of items, with lots of nice storage pockets, and all the right features.One disapointment: The bag will outlast the wheels by a lot. If they would sell replacement wheels this bag would be the very best."
2,Treacle.,"I dislike writers who cannot get their facts straight. For instance: ""My DAD USED TO HAVE AN OLD 'FIFTY-TWO THUNDERBIRD,"" on page 37 indicates the writer is less than knowledgeable about cars. The first Thunderbird on the market was 1955. Further, she has so many realtives running around this story that her protagonist must write up a chart so that even she can keep them straight.I rarely discard a novel mid way, but I almost did that with this one. I only hung in there to see if the writer was using the T-Bird blunder to try to catch the culprit in the last chapters.When a writer is incorrect in one of her/his facts and I catch it I think that there must be many others that I am not aware of or am not smart enough to catch.I feel cheated."
3,Still having fun with this series.,"In this fourth book of this series, we finally find out how many brothers Deborah has (11). Her large family of older brothers has been mentioned in previous books, but until now we were never told exactly how many. As for the mystery plot in this book, it is tenuous at best. If you are not paying close attention, you could be left with a lot of questions regarding motive. The main story with this book is that a developer is looking to get his hands on the property that Deborah, her father, and her brothers own (collectively approximately 2500 acres) as well as the surrounding properties owned by neighbors. One of Deborah's brothers (who lives in California) has lost his job and is condering selling his small parcel (3 acres) to the developer. The major difference with this book is that is doesn't have the 'light' humor that Maron has put into her previous books. Still, the author is maintaining a steady pace with the series."
3,Up Jumps the Devil,"Not one of my favorite Deborah Knott mysteries. There are many members of the Knott family introduced and named, maybe too many, as it is difficult to keep track. The author did not tie the murder and motive together very well and left the story feeling rather weak."
3,Great Expectations--Little Substance,"For an award winning book, UP JUMPS THE DEVIL by Margaret Maron is a grave disappointment. Judge Deborah Knott's family relations are explained, but why the murder was committed isn't.It is as if since the series began as a cozy mystery the frame must remain and the author fills in the blanks of family, rural south culture, changing values, and traditions.This is not one of Margaret Maron's best, but the fourth edition of Deborah Knott does open the way to more detective and less rationalizing.Nash Black author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
5,good continuation of series,I enjoyed this book. It was great continuation of the Deborah Knott series. Most of Maron's characters reminds me of someone I know. I highly recommend this book and the whole Deborah Knott series.
5,The best Georgetter Heyer by far - truly wonderful,"Heyer is absolutely the Queen of Regency romances, and Venetia is, as far as I'm concerned, her best. An independent woman determined to resist her two insistent suitors and take good care of her younger borther; she meets her new neighbour, Damerel, the most notorious rake in England. At first he is tempted to seduce her, but later becomes protective towards her. Then, when her older brother marries and she is forced to leave her home for London, she thinks she will never see Damerel again. Desperate measures are called for...This is not a typical Regency; Venetia is not a blushing debutante, and Damerel is not a dandified town gentleman. But the characters are delightfully appealing and Damerel is such a wonderful, down-to-earth hero! Read it, re-read it, treasure it for ever. I do."
4,"Great reading, ok novel","I'm not a fan of the fake-Jane Austen novel (which seem to be proliferating lately), but I got the audiobook of Venetia read by Richard Armitage anyway. His rich, funny, sexy narration makes the mediocre (and predictable) plot enjoyable. It's a good one for a long car trip (which is why I bought it), but I think it was Armitage rather than Heyer who made the miles fly by."
5,Heyer's books,"I recommend all of Georgette Heyer's books. I love the characters in this book and it is very typical of Heyer's writing,"
2,Review of Abridged Audio Book,"Please note, this is not a review of the original book, which is one of my favorites, but only of this particular audio recording.The audio book gets a point for the reader, he did well with the various voices of the characters, and it gets a point for, well it's ""Venetia"", albeit a really rather butchered ""Venetia"".It loses 3 points for the unbelievable amount of abridgment. Not just ""descriptions of every blade of grass"" to (mis?)quote SE Hinton, but huge pertintent parts of Damerel and Venetia's growing relationship are just left out. The bit at the end where she arrives and tells him she understands that she in ineligible because of her mother and he forcefully rebuts her statements - so lovely, and so missing from this recording along with so many other important stages in their relationship. Really, if one is going to cut out so many romantic and funny bits, why bother to record the other parts of the story?"
3,Drastically abridged,This is one of my favorite Georgette Heyer novels and the heart and delight was abridged out of it.
3,I love Heyer but...,"I somehow found the two main characters lacking. The heroine is simply too perfect for my tastes! Also, she always seem to be in a joyous mood. Too much sunniness gets to my nerves. Also, I really didn't get a feel of the hero. I felt like he was under-written. The most entertainment I had from the book was from the nurse, the horrible mother-in-law, and the brother!"
5,"A powerful story, an excellent writer","This is a great story based on a powerful character, Ulysses, who tries to get away from Buenos Aires and from his miserable life.Well written and with an edgy sense of humor, you don't just read ""Beer cans..."" You get nicely drunk with it! Enjoy it!"
1,These don't work at all for me or my training partner,"At least for boxing gloves that are in constant use, these didn't do anything for drying out or deoderizing them. Paper towel tubes (for airing and drying) and foot spray (to kill anything that want's to grow in there) work better."
3,A Christmas thing!,"I enjoyed this DVD very much much. It makes a nice edition to my Christmas viewing. It is like you are really there, at Covent Garden, and viewing the live performance!"
3,good at the beginning but then . . .,"We got this video to watch with our children at Christmas time. My children love the first half of the performance, but after that, they ask me to turn it off. They miss the dance of the peppermints and Mother Ginger and get bored watching Lesley Collier dance again, and again, and again. Perhaps people came to see her dance, but it seems to me that the story gets lost in the end of this performance in such a long feature of the prima donna."
1,Did not work!,"I ordered this cable and it did not work. I replaced it with one of my old ones and everything worked fine. I used it to go from a USB to Serial adapter to a vinyl cutting plotter. It was a frustrating experience using a new cable and trying to figure out why the machine would not respond. As a last resort, I used a cable from another machine and it worked fine. The shipping was really slow. I'm sending it back. It might work for a clothes line, but not as a data cable."
2,OK for an Overview,"This book is OK for anyone who want to gain a rough overview of the Network+ Exam topics.However, this book doesn't provide you with in-depth knowledge of the different Networking Technologies.If you want to get a serious, strong exam preparation, there are other Network+ Exam preparation Training Books who perform this task much better.Additionally, this book describes the different technologies in a hard understandable way. So the lerning process is not well balanced. That is why i rate the book only with 2 Stars."
4,A sumptuous composer who seem to improve throughout the years!,"If the term composer in the widest sense of the expression may be used as a creator of atmospheres and besides a way of living and feeling, Michel Legrand should be named among a very reduced list in which Vladimir Cosma, Charles Trenet, Charles Aznavour or Gilbert Becaud also figure.Legrand is a chansonere, a fervent lyricist, an inspired composer for soundtrack films (Cherburg's umbrellas, Yennntl, Theme of 42' s Summer, or The windmills of your mind, are by themselves convincing testimonies that avail it).His music contains humor, charm, nostalgia, poetry and candidness with idiosyncratic elegance and enraptured inspiration.His incursions into jazz territory, makes me recall that old statement of Blas Pascal: ""One is not great by being at one extreme, but touching both at the same time."""
4,Very good entertaining summer reading,"My memories of drive in theaters with my parents, purchasing that first bra ""bend over and shake them honey"", and struggling with being 13 all comes to life again in this fun book. It is quick to read and I easily found myself lost in the story. Fun not fluff with a sophisticated ending."
3,A first publication which shows great future potential,This was a 'good read' which I enjoyed very much. The author gives deep insight into the personal relationships of the narrator's parents which give a very real impression of the way lives and loves have changed since the 1950's. The story meshes well and the characters are well defined. There is also a very real feeling of 'coming of age' for more than just Callie-Ann.
2,not as good as it could have been (SPOILERS),"This started out strong. Story was good, well written. But for the level of emotion that should have been assoc. with the Crime in the end... IT was lacking."
5,This was an excellent read for all ages!,"As a 13-year-old, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and it helped give me an understanding of the 1950's, as I never experienced that time period. This book creates very unique and developed charectors which change greatly throughout the story."
3,IT WAS JUST OKAY,"Very, very slow developing!! It was more of a story of a 12year old girl passing thru the summer before her 13th birthday.Yes, , ,there was her mom, , her dad, , ,Charlie Memphis, , ,the turtle.One of the irritations for me was, , ,she was always in the right placeat the right time---that really does not happen ttthhhaaattt often!!!"
1,Beware of offensive language and subject matter,"Callie Anne recalls the summer of 1956. Nearing 13, Callie Anne was stuck at home with her parents during a long, hot summer in rural Indiana. Her father was an angry, bitter man who ran a drive-in but hated it. Her mother hadn't left the house in five years, but had catered to Callie's dad and his moods. When a drifter named Charlie Memphis came to work at the drive-in, both mother and daughter fell for his charms. A disastrous turn of events changed all their lives forever. Years later it was up to Callie Anne to unlock the secret of the human bones discovered at the site of the old drive-in.For mature readers only. Contains offensive language as well as descriptions of sexual encounters and trying on a bra for the first time."
3,Got one but not sure I'll ever use it,I bought one...but it's only really useful for triming. My pro grip clamps do a much better job and are much more versatile. (Of course they cost considerably more) I suspect this is why Milwaukee does not include it with the purchase of your saw. Had I have thought it through; I probably would not have purchased the item.
4,A Must for Zoo Keepers,"This book is just spectacular. There is just a vast range of topics in this book. There are chapters on chemical immobilization, medical termnology, effects of stress, and numerous chapters on restraint procedures by Order/Family and in some cases individual species. Each restraint procedure has detailed pictures. The only problem I have with this book is the pictures are black and white, other than that fact the pictures are very clear and informative. If you work in any wildlife facility, or plan to, I highly recomend buying this book. Also would come in handy for any biologist or zoologist who plans to do in the field studies because of the indepth chapters on chemical restraint/immobilization."
1,Weird form factor,"I was pretty disappointed with this wallet, the main issue being it's form factor. It definitely is thin, which is what I was looking for.However, when folded up, the two outside ""wings"" did not line up with the center piece in regards to their length. So, the center piece sticks out about 1 cm from the two outside wings. I do not know if this is by design or just a manufacturing fault with the one I purchased. But, it looked really odd to me.I also had problems getting my credit cards to insert smoothly into the various card slots. They kept getting caught on something inside the slot.So, I returned it and I ended up going with the Slim Wallet, which was much cheaper, held more, was still slim in form, and looks and feels much more high quality.eBags was awesome with the return - they took care of shipping and the shipping label. Super painless."
1,Meh.,"The middle section is supposed to stick out to allow easily flipping open one side. It took me a while to figure that out. More importantly, many card readers aren't strong enough to read a card with the RFID shield right behind it, and the cards (even in the middle section) have shielding behind them. So, it's useless for me."
2,Hopkins is no author,"Although the idea which the story is based is good, this book was extremely poorly written and should not have been published. Hopkins is no author"
2,Just okay,"It wasn't really what I was looking for, which was more like a Zagats for Rome. I can see why others might find this useful, as it is tiny and easily fits into your pocket. But for a city with a zillion restaurants, to me it seemed more like a restaurant listing, rather than substantive reviews that would really help steer us, so I returned it."
2,Needs a map.,"Needs a map to quickly reference what is located in your vicinity and color coded for the type of establishment - Cafe, Deli, Formal Dining, etc.) Needs to show hours of operation."
1,book fell apart,I don't know how good or bad the contents of this book is. I just received it and upon opening it up it fell apart! It is very shoddly constructed and cheaply made. Pages fell out in several places. Don't buy this if you want a neat guide that won't loose important pages. This is not up to Amazon standards! Joannahs
3,Not an essential guide for me.,"As this book was a potentially nice guide to good food in Rome, I found it difficult to use without a detailed map or a GPS. The book and users would definately benefit from a map inside with numbers showing locations. I ended up not using it at all with my children because once we were out, it was too painful to search for locations. I may give it away to a friend that travels to Rome without kids."
4,Very aceesible guide to Classical Greece,This book is accessible both to history students and to laypeople. I find it enjoyable to read even on topics I don't know much about as well as being useful for my studies.
2,carmelita,"The sound quality is poor. If your're looking for Carmelita, the artist is Adam Duritz. Or go to I-10 Chronicles.com."
3,Average,"Frankly, I was disappointed with this effort. Having said that, I would still buy the CD for the outstanding first song, ""Goin' Away"". I can't stop playing it. (Pity it's the only track not written by the boys!) Another tour of Down Under is long overdue ..."
5,Fresh New Music From Three Texas Favorites,"The new Flatlanders album, Now Again, is a wonderful fusion of the talents of longtime friends Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Joe Ely and Butch Hancock. While elements of their individual style are evident throughout the album, the Flatlanders have suceeded in creating a distinctive new collaborative effort that feels much greater than the sum of its parts."
3,Cute Earrings but...,"These are really cute earrings, they claim to be made with 925 sterling silver material (usually 925 sterling silver doesn't cause irritations to my skin). However, I am allergic to the earrings metal, I get infection on both earlobs after one day of wearing. It is a shame I really like the look of these. =("
4,Really flattering!,I purchased these for myself and they are great. They have tarnished a bit but overall the quality is good especially for the price. I get compliments all the time on them.
2,"too,too much!","Shoe was fairly comfortable but did not look ""right"" on foot. The ""front""of shoe was too short. Item was true to size."
1,Jangle slide,I just got these in ivory and black and I am returning both pairs. The price was great but the shoes were so unattractive in person and both pairs looked like somebody had been wearing them for a long time. The gold studs were scratched badly and leather part were dirty. Don't waste your money and time on these pairs.
3,booksize,on site books american album gives size but sellers are selling them with diff size. not good. with out emailing all of them you don't know what their size is.
1,"PURE JUNK,THESE MOVIES ARE IN SUCH POOR SHAPE THAT YOU CAN'T WATCH THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!",THE COPIES THEY USED TO TRANSFER THESE MOVIES MUST HAVE BEEN PULLED FROM A FIRE IS ALL I CAN THINK AS I WATCHED(OR TRIED TO WATCH I SHOULD SAY) THESE MOVIES. YOU CAN FIND BETTER COPIES OUT THERE SO LOOK FOR THEM!!!!!!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Poor sound and picture quality,"I purchased this DVD for the movie ""And Then There Were None."" I loved the Agatha Christie novel and wanted to see the movie. However, the sound is so difficult to understand even at high volume that I had to give up watching it. I understand and enjoy most old movies even with poor picture quality; this was the poorest one I've seen. On picture quality alone I wouldn't say this is a problematic DVD, but because it seems impossible to understand, I'd have to recommend skipping this one and finding one with restored sound. The movie itself however is probably much better than two stars; the two stars are for sound and picture quality only."
4,This is a touch up hvlp spray gun NOT a full size 20 oz cup,It does do a good job on pattern and quality overall. The issue I have with this gun is that it needs a water/oil filter/separator and a pressure gauge switch. By the time you install all that it becomes a very long and bulky handle which makes it more difficult to maneuver in tight spaces. Also you need to refill the cup too many times.
5,LOVE THAT PAINT GUN,I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL SPRAYER BY ANY MEANS. THIS IS THE FIRST SPRAY GUN I HAVE EVER OWNED. I BOUGHT IT MAINLY TO SPRAY STAIN ON LARGE OBJECTS. I WAS IMPRESSED ON HOW EASY IT WAS TO UNDERSTAND AND OPERATE. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE ELSE. IT WORKS GREAT.
3,Many memories with the music,"Typical ""sevillana"" type music. I enjoyed listening to it and it brought back many memories of my experience is Seville. Great for the person who wants to listen to traditional music from Andalucia."
5,Great Book,"I read this book after taking the ACHDS because I was interested in setting up Apple Servers in different environments as well as taking the Mac OS X Server Essentials v10.4 Exam (9L0-507). It was one of the easiest reads I've had in a long time. I came from the Microsoft side of IT, and some of the material from that area is dry. This book was helpful, and I enjoyed the real life examples. I still use it on occasion as a guide, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to know about Mac OS 10.4 Server, and how to apply it in the field."
2,Onyl scratches the surface...,"While there are some decent tips and explanations in this book, it seems more like a advertisement for the authors firm: whenever things get interesting the chapter ends and the recommendation points to hiring a firm to take care of your system administrative needs. I wanted a book that explains every single setting in the firewall administration panel for instance, what I get here is an instruction on how to close and open ports, which was very obvious in the first place. But maybe I should have looked at the title a little closer, after all it is the little black book, not the big one."
3,Bought the book but never got very far...,I bought and still own this book. Mac server is totally different than the regular mac. It requires knowledge of DNS and networking. I was able to get a windows xp computer to log in to mac server which pretended to be a windows 2000 ADS domain controller.I don't know enough to really rate the book.
4,Careful: Doesn't take standard staples...,"This is a great, easy to use, dependable stapler. Though the staples are cheap, just know that this machine doesn't use ""standard"" staples that you would use in 90% of other staplers.(Manual Swingline staplers.)"
4,"Would make Tim ""The Toolman"" Taylor Proud","This is a very powerful stapler. In fact, it sounds like a pneumatic nail gun when you use it, and gives the impression of having about as much power. As a previous reviewer stated, if you are only stapling 2 sheets, it tends to send the staple clean through the paper, leaving a tiny slit in the paper, and a folded staple that falls out the back. I will try the remedy of using 3/8 inch staples, as a previous reviewer mentioned, but I don't have those yet (it comes packaged with the 1/4"" staples). For stapling larger bundles quickly, this stapler does a great job. It's a stapler on steroids."
3,Loud,"I read the reviews that were associated with this product before deciding to purchase and thought I was getting a great product but this is one of the bulkiest electric staplers and surprisingly loud when you staple something. The people in the other side of the office thought I was mad and hitting my desk in frustration when I first started using this monster and it does hurt my ears. Unfortunatly I staple a lot of papers during the day so it is not one of those seldom things things that I use, it is a very busy stapler so I don't know if I would recommend this product because of that. Also the ""low stapler indicator light"" is not very bright so you don't really notice when the staples are getting low because in a well lit office you can barley see the light."
2,Jammed upon arrival - looked used,"I recived the Stapler, seemed as if it was used the case, outer shell was scuffed. Plugged it in and right away it jammed up. Sorry Bostich - you better get your act togetherAs for Amazon, they are a great company to work with, they immediatly sent me return label for process of free shipping return"
1,Great price for a great product,"I purchased a different brand of stapler and it broke almost immediately. I thought it was my fault, so I purchased another one. It broke right away too. This stapler is a little noisy but it is very sturdy."
4,Boom!,"You need something stapled, you just slip it in the slot and BOOM!People in your office, and down the hall and down the street know that you have stapled something. This is no sissy stapler, this a strong stapler that will quickly and securely tack together a big stack of papers.Two things though:1) if you have a short stack, the stapler is sometimes too powerful. It is made for bigger stacks, so instead of neatly stapling two sheets together, you have a stable-sized hole in your paper.2) You need proprietary staples, so you can't just use any staples, you have to buy the special staples. I had to wait while the staples were on order at my office. Not a huge thing, and the waiting was my fault, but it was annoying."
2,Jammed for good!,"We bought one of these new but after a couple of months the stapler jamed; I took it apart and found the 'anvil' that moves over the staple when it strikes gets warped, not made strong enough to withstand the pressure put on it by the stapler. Can not find the plate/anvil to replace it. If anyone has a source for replacement on this part would appreciate contact info. ""Works good when it works"""
5,Hassle free swing hook,High quality swing hook that really does the job. Delivery was very swift too!
2,Too graphic,"I don't know if I missed the point, but I simply found this movie too graphic to be counted among the top Filipino films. It might be artistic, granted, but there are a handful of other films I'd recommend rather than this one - e.g. ""Magnifico"", ""The Blossoming of Maxi Olivieros"". Through the caricaturization of the characters, furthermore, it made it hard for me to feel involved at any point. Plainly put, I was disappointed."
3,"Just like the second edition, only with an updated cover","I was quite happy with the second edition when it came out in 2002, so I suppose I shouldn't complain too much. Still, when many other LP phrasebooks (such as Thai and Indonesian) were updated I was somewhat disappointed when I found that the third edition had not been. It remains a workable phrasebook for short-term visitors and anyone interested in Bahasa Melayu, with both local spellings and easy-to-understand pronunciation guides."
3,stapler,"Not sure what happened exactly, but the stapler jammed on the 2nd try of using. I can not figure out how to get it working again as the part where you load staples is sealed and you are unable to view as you are in a regular stapler. i have one of these at work and it works fine so maybe just a matter of knowing how to fix simple jams to get it working again."
4,Not your average date movie,"If the title of the film doesnt entice you, nothing will. Love Like Blood was an intense film that will keep you riveted the whole time. Everyone can identify with at least one part of Kevins personality which makes the movie a personal journey for everyone who watches it. For his first feature film Schneider does an excellent job with the role of Kevin and his chemistry with Smith is both believable and enjoyable to watch. I recommend this film to anyone tired of the same ol' same ol' in the movie industry."
4,Drum & Bass masterpiece,"I can't believe I'm the first person to review this album. This is Fauna Flash's only true ""Drum & Bass"" album. It's also one of the first compost releases to get play by members of the Metalheadz crew. I would consider this album to be pretty essential in drum & bass headz' collections. The production is flawless, the jungle breaks are tight and on-point, and the analog bass is tearing! Really, the only complaint I'd have on this album is that it only has 9 tracks. The first 7 tracks are drum & bass steppers, and the last 2 are jazzier, more downtempo tracks. The individual tracks are around 6 minutes long on average, so it's not quite as short as it seems. Overall it's an excellent album, and one that I keep in heavy rotation even now."
3,VERY BEST OF ON PRISM LABEL ARE RE-RECORDINGS,"These are from the late 1980s and include some new songs to Petula's repertoire. But if you want the original 1960s recordings of her classics like ""Downtown,"" buy a BMG or Sanctuary CD, not this one."
5,Wonderful!!!!,"Love my clock, large numbers, I can see it clearly at night.Love it !! Good price too."
5,great clock,"It's an LCD clock, they work, they accurate, they auto adjust from get-go...It's 17 bux, what more can you expect from them? Sing you a lullaby? cook a dinner? make love to you?"
5,Great Visibility!,"Have been searching for replacement home weather station and found one that works. However, the time display is about 3/4-inch high, making it difficult to see the time of day across a room. I found this clock and it's perfect! The numbers are about 2-inches high -- very sharp and clear to read across a room. I use this clock in the family room, on the fireplace mantle,so the brightness of the numbers isn't a factor in keeping anyone awake. I now wear glasses and even without wearing the glasses I'm able to read the numbers clearly across the room. This clock also has a ""PM"" indicator. Am very happy with my purchase."
2,Faulty Alarm,"Fine clock, works great, except the alarm is very very soft... Not a good ALARM clock but a fine plain ole clock."
2,"good design, poor quality control","Ordered two, but only one worked. One unit was fine, but one came with several failed L E D'S which made the clock display unreadable. Factory quickly shipped a replacement at no charge, but they would do better if they had better quality control. Otherwise, clock has great design, nice features, and big readable display. Too bad you have only a 50 50 chance to get one that works."
1,Can't hear it!,"I bought this as an ALARM clock. I was sitting on the edge of my bed wondering why my new alarm clock hadn't gone off when I realized that it was going off. I had to pick the clock up just to be sure. This alarm is a joke. I have heard louder watches than this clock.Beautiful big numbers and nice features, but if you want to wake up skip this clock."
1,"Unit only worked a couple of hours, company didn't return my voicemail","Unit was defective, only worked for a few hours. That can happen occassionally though, right? But I called and left a voicemail with the company and didn't ever receive a call back. Overall not terribly impressed with the experience."
2,defective out of box,Bought three units. Two for the house and one for the motorhome. The two for home were defective out of the box and were replaced with units that now work.Tested the one for the motorhome and it seemed ok but on our first trip it did not work the third night we plugged it in.Not a very good quality product. would make sure of the return policy before ordering.
1,Alarm Clock,"Junk.....can't hear alarm...I even pressed it up to my ear and can't hear it...thats pretty bad...had no loudness controls...so ordered another one...same thing...called the mfg...she even admitted that the alarm isn't very loud on this model..not very loud i can deal with, but SILENT I don't think so... 2 out of 2 defective...not a good deal...which is to bad...because I really did like the big red clock face and the fact that it sets itself,."
3,Doesn't Keep Accurate Time,"I've had this clock for just over a year. I does what I bought it for, sort of. I wanted a large digital clock to use in my TV room and for that it's fine. The problem is it has gained four minutes in the last year. Since it sets itself automatically from atomic clocks there doesn't appear to be any way to adjust it. It appears that when the time changes (daylight savings time coming on or going off) is when the flawed update happens."
3,Good clock,"This clock is what we ordered, as we travel a great deal and wanted a atomic clock that would make it easier to change time zones without all the manual changes. It has large numbers, which is helpful, but way too bright. There is no way to dim the brightness, so it will be replaced with another one. We will remember that the clock needs to have a dimmer feature too."
1,Don't buy this one..,"Boy...did I goof!! I thought this was an atomic clock. Turns out all it does is reset itself from regular time to daylight savings etc. Not what I needed. I want one that resets after the power goes out....or if you move it from spot to spot. I really DID think it was self setting.....sorry.I would have given his NO STARS if that was an option. How in the world can an ""atomic"" clock be so WRONG! Sorry for yelling..but this is beyond ridiculis. It is actually 14 minutes fast...and as mentioned by someone earlier there is no way to make corrections. What a waste.Complaint #2 is that.....if someone needs big numbers so as to see them wothout glasses....it might also follow that their hearing is not as sharp as it once was. The alarm??? on this thing is not as loud as mant of the birds outside my window each morning. I am hopeful this review will help someone make a different choice when purchasing from this company."
1,Shipping Sucks,Don't buy this thru Amazon unless you get a Fed-X tracking # otherwise the shipper will use the cheapest & slowest carrier.Over 3 weeks and still have not received a 2 lb. clock.
5,Nightstand Clock Large Numbers,Love the Clock. I can see it in the middle of the night. It keeps the time after a power outage.
2,Disappointing,"I read the multiple reviews and decided I could deal with the flashing colon and check out the alarm sound for myself. No problem with the colon or alarm, but setting the alarm is difficult. The hours jump ahead which requries setting the wake time over and over again. This is even with very careful manipulation of the buttons. Also, the on-off switch is so tight, I have to turn the clock over to set or turn off the alarm. Perhaps my clock is an anomaly, but I intend to purchase another clock. This one is a pain to use. Also, the time setting was incorrect when first plugged in, but it was easy to correct."
1,Chaney Instruments Thor Large Display Alarm Clock,"I bought this clock for my aging father in July '10. It worked well and he could see it until today....it went blank, nothing on the display. I replaced the 4 batteries even though I had it plugged into the electrical outlet and still nothing. I would have thought it would have lasted longer than 4 months. A piece of junk!!!!"
1,Didn't last long,"This is a nice product, but it only lasted about two years. Many of The LED segments went out, so now the display is in code."
2,Shorted out,I bought this clock several months ago and loved it. It was the best thing ever. Then one morning everything I had plugged into the same outlet went out. By smell I finally found that the clock had shorted out and I spent hours fixing everything.
5,Love It,"Large display clock. Unobtrusive, no noise, simple, reliable. What's not to like?I thought I might not like the flashing colon sign...but it is no problem at all.Very happy with this purchase."
4,Chaney Instruments Thor Large Display Alarm Clock,Works fine except that it seems to drift toward running a bit fast over time. Large display is easily visible from many feet away.
2,could be improved,"I am in my sixties and wear both glasses and hearing aids. What sold me on this clock was the 2 inch display. I can see what time it is without my glasses. This is the only positive thing I can say about this clock. The display is bright and in a dark bedroom it's too bright. There is no dimmer switch. When the alarm goes off you have to manually turn it off by flipping a switch to the off position. The switch is on the back of the unit and I need my glasses to see which button it is. And as far as the alarm goes, I can barely hear it without my hearing aids and I don't wear them to bed. As my job requires that I get up before the crack of dawn, I can't afford to sleep through it's oh so tiny beep-beep. If you want to see the time from accross the room, I say go for it. But, if you need the daylight scared into you like I do, get something else."
2,Great beginning--soon wasted,"I purchased this clock last September. Out of the box it worked great. Good visibility and initially sets itself. Within about 4 months a couple of the little Led's ""died"". The time mostly was readable, but on the hour slot 2 or 3 leds missing is noticeable.A little over one month ago I noticed the time was off (slow) several minutes. I tried to find a means to minimally adjust the time forward several minutes. It turns out the only time you can manually set is the alarm. I tried unplugging the clock and waiting for several minutes and reconnecting--still wrong. I then tried plugging into another outlet--no change. Finally, I took the clock to a friends house and plugged it in there--still the time was slow.I guess if you want a disposable clock for about 6 months use it may suffice..."
2,OMG,"This clock is so bright and there is no dimmer. The plstic face had a protective cover that you remove when you get it but it looked like was dragged on the floor before that was put on. Number size good, thats it."
2,Stopped working in 6 months!,"Paid 20.99 for the clock. It worked as promised first six months. BUT it stopped working in 6 months, went dark and nothing can be done to turn the lights back on. It seems like if I return it I have to pay for shipping both ways. Not sure why if the product is defective i have to pay for shipping."
5,Chaney Instruments Acurite Large Display Alarm Clock,"I really like this clock due to the large display, but small overall size. Easy to read from afar; at night, I don't need to put on my glasses. My first one was about two years ago. They have redesigned the settings buttons on the back so that it is clear that you can adjust the TIME up/down (by hour and minutes). I now have 3 and waiting for #4."
5,Easy on the Eyes Display,"This has a large display and is therefore easy to see even with the unaided eye. I don't need the clock as an alarm so I can't rate that function. Also, I don't know if the DST feature works since no DST date has passed yet. But if you want an easy to use and easy to see clock, this is it. I just ordered two more.A peek at the instructions tells how to set the time manually if you so wish, and also how to change the batteries. Instructions are wonderful things.Since there are two dimensions for the clock on Amazon web page just let me clarify: dimensions are 3 1/4""H x 7 1/8""W x 2 3/4""D. So a pretty small footprint.This is not to be confused with an ""atomic clock"". There are no radio signals and the clock operates on house current with battery backup and resets itself after a power interruption.UPDATE 3 MONTHS LATERI did buy two more clocks for a total of three. All kept accurate time and changed day light savings time correctly."
5,"Great, if you want big numbers","For anyone with a mild sight impairment, that makes reading a clock difficult at night without glasses, this is a perfect clock. The numerals are about 3 inches high. However, if that visual assistance is not needed, this design is anything but subtle during the daytime."
4,Bright with Big Numerals,"I don't use the alarm. It is very bright. I set some pieces of translcuent red plastic in front to reduce the brightness. It gains time. Over several weeks it will pick up a minute or two compared to my ""atomic"" clock. Without my glasses, I can see the numbers easily 10 feet away compared to the 1 inch on the atomic clock."
5,Mfr must listen to reviews,"Received my clock and I love it. Mine does not flash it's seconds colons as described in previous reviews, guess the mfr changed that."
2,"It's not just big, but bright.","From other reviews, it sounds like this was just what a lot of people wanted. I suppose I wasn't prepared for *just* how big the clock is (take a good look at the measurements before ordering). Once I got used to the size though--& it's true, it's easy to read, & it does have a nice design--I was still unprepared for how extremely bright it would be at night. I had purchased it to place on my bedside table--not a good idea! It's sort of like sleeping with a neon sign by your bed. Anyway, this clock is definitely not for bedrooms. (I was surprised that it did not have a dimmer feature, because it seems pretty limited without one.)"
5,This Clock Worked Out-of-the-Box!,"I love this clock. I plugged it in, slid the switch in the rear into the right time zone, and viola, the time was set and has been set ever since. I've used other atomic clocks where you have to press and hold a button to cycle it into the right time zone; then, you press and hold another button until the clock receives the radio signal and sets the time. Most of the time, I could not get it to cycle to correct time zone.The digits are large and bright; I can easily see it from across the room. I have not tried alarm, so cannot comment on that; as far as time keeping, ease of use, and readability, this clock rocks! Great price too."
1,Loses time,"In the past several months, it has steadly lost time. I do not like the fact that you cannot reset the time. I have several other automatic (atomic) clocks and they work fine. I'm going to trash this one, I would not even donate it to a thrift store because of its inaccuracies."
2,Returned it,"I really liked the large display and the automatic time set function. However, the on-off button on the alarm was broken. Item was returned but shipping was not refunded."
3,Bright like Las Vegas,"I got this clock to replace a similar one when the alarm stopped working. This one has some cool features, like you just select the time zone on the back and it automatically knows the time. The alarm is turned on and off with a rather stiff switch on the back. Not sure if that's good or bad: on the one hand, it's really a pain to turn off, on the other hand, maybe if I have to think and utilize my motor skills in the morning, I'll actually get up. The biggest thing though is how incredibly bright the face is. Every time i pass it, i am surprised by the shocking red led numbers. When I turn off all other lights, there is a red glow in the room, like I have a neon sign next to my bed. This will take some getting used to."
4,"Nice big numbers, time is a tad off","My eyesight is lousy without my glasses. I wanted a clock that I could read when I'm in bed at night or when I get up, This does the trick. I don't use any of its alarm features so I can't speak to them.I also like the fact that you never need to set it, however I've noticed that its clock is 3-4 minutes off from my Cell phone or Computer clock. It's fast so it's no big deal, but can be annoying if you need every clock in the house to be identical.The other negative is it could really use a dimmer. At night this thing can be pretty bright."
4,I'm happy with this clock,"I have always liked atomic clocks that set their time on a radio signal but they are hard to find in led displays. This clock with a preset time and the ability to adjust itself from daylight and back seemed like the right thing. I like everything about this and would like it even better if it had a dimmer function, it's a little too bright at night as I use it in my bedroom. The bright intensity would probably be nice for a daylight setting. Will it keep time accuratly over the long run? (we'll see)Wish I could rate it 4.5 it deserves it. Would have rated it 5 if it had a dimmer function.Pros;Auto adjust for daylight timeYou can easily set the timeNice big displayStands up verticle so you can read it across the roomPackaged nicely and arrived quickly, worked perfectly out of the boxCons;Would be nice if it were a little dimmer or ideally had a dimmer functionWould I reccomend to a friend; YepWould I buy another; Yep"
3,You can get the directions from a website,"I purchased this book in hopes of getting a better handle of the methods and philosophies behind the wonderful prompts (""The Guidelines of Composing"") which help people access their felt sense and write with abandon.Unfortunately, the book is just the guidelines, book-ended by two sparse chapters which do little more than substantiate each other.As long as you have access to the Guidelines of Composing from the internet (you can find them by Googling the author), it is not worth the purchase."
5,WOW! - An Amazing Performer - A Musicians Musician,"One of the greatest ACL shows of all time!Steve is awesome and doesn't fail us here either.This is a must have video for all guitar players, songwriters and anyone with a yearning for genuine acoustic sounds.There isn't a bad momentA few beers and a night with Steve GoodmanIt doesn't get much better than that.I really never thought I'd be able to play guitar along side Steve but with this video it is a real treat...thanks"
3,WARNING: Episodes are out of order.,"The episodes from ""Hidden Temple"" come from Pokemon:Johto League Champions-Vol 6 and Pokemon:Johto League Champions-Vol 7.Buy these two volumes instead, and you'll get much more for your money -- More episodes, and they are in order."
2,Sized for a gymnasium,"This is a very nice looking clock. Unfortunately, it is ENORMOUS! Something I didn't realize from the specs until I received it and took it out of the box. Totally out of proportion for our small kitchen, so it has to go back."
2,Kaw...,"Well the only reason I bought and saw this movie was because of Sean Patrick Flanery. Well it was good if you like him, which I do, but the movie itself was pretty horrid. If you are not a fan of his I wouldn't recommend this movie."
2,kawawful,"This is really poor film making. It is not fun ,scary etc. The only decent section is the interview with Rod Taylor after the film."
2,It's Pretty Kaw-ful,"I really enjoyed Sheldon Wilson's ""Shallow Ground"", but this movie is terrible. The concept obviously works, check out Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". For some reason it doesn't work here. Maybe it's because of all the clichés, but this film just fell apart from the get go. There is no suspense, the acting is half-hearted, and that's not just because of the bad script. I actually couldn't even sit through the entire movie. So do yourself a favor, don't waste an hour and a half of your life on this movie. I didn't."
3,IT'S YOUR KAW,"This retake on the claasic Hitchcock's THE BIRDS even features the 1963 movie's hero, Rod Taylor, although this time around the durable actor plays the town's loveable doctor. In the '63 film, all kinds of birds were the predators; this time around, it's just the ravens, who have been infected by feeding on the carcasses of diseased cattle.The special effects are pretty decent and while there's not a whole lot of new ground broken, the film succeeds in entertaining those of us into the attacking animals venue. Sean Patrick Flanery takes a leave from his villainous role on THE DEAD ZONE and plays the stalwart sheriff.KAW won't receive raven reviews, but it's a pleasant enough diversion."
2,"Okay, but a bit gory.","I can't pretend to be surprised at this one, as I knew going in that it was about the birds attacking. But it was a bit gory in comparison to ""The Birds"". That was not really a surprise either, but I wished I didn't have to turn my head so much when it got gross. I find it a bit humorous that they supposedly got mad cow disease. But the gore factor makes me not recommend it for younger audiences. Not that this genre is for kids, but the original film would be okay by today's standards, I guess.All in all, it was okay, but I had hoped to see more bird attack with less blood. One other question I have for both films would be, were the birds that powerful? I mean maybe a thousand at once might be, but anything less and I would think a human would be able to fight them off. I mean I face tons of these birds every time I go shopping at the local WalMart!"
3,"""Kaw"" is a surprisingly fun and better than average film.","Okay, it is another us against it film in the tradition of the far superiorThe Birdsby Alfred Hitchcock, but it's still very entertaining.I found the cast of familiar faces to be both likable and believable, and, of course, I love the tip of the hat to Hitchcock by having Rod Taylor presence here who was in his ""The Birds."" I found the story to be tight in that there isn't too much, if any, in the way of ""filler"", and the direction was confident if not very ambitious.At first glance in the video rental store, this has all the look of a straight to video or some Sci-Fi Channel reject film, but it really isn't. If you are into the genre of attacking animals, then you really should get a good kick out of this film. It was a pleasant surprise for me and it may be for you too."
1,Think for yourself...,"Or if you don't then buy this book on how Shakespeare is best taught through film. Don't let your class form opinions of their own or even experience the play by staging it themselves, instead do what these teachers do! It's not all bad, there are some decent articles but they don't talk about teaching."
5,An excellent history,"This is a fantastic listen and highly recommended for everyone, even for those with only a passing interest in manned spaceflight. It is full of intriguing human and technical stories, and excellent background information for context. If I'd had the book I could not have put it down."
3,pride,"this is a pretty good set of pride fights, my main reason for buying this is cause id like to collect all the sets. being this is the start of pride with old rules 1 to 4 and then the new rules in pride 5, there are some super slow fights but there is also some really good ones in there to."
1,Old perfume sent out,I just decided to open and smell my perfume and it is definitely old. I didn't open till now since I still had my own that I was finishing up.I am very disappointed and spent alot of money for this item. I will never buy again. They should not be selling perfume that has expired.
3,so-so,"Lots of creative ideas, relies a lot on veggies, and personally I don't think the meat recipes i've tried taste very good. If you like eating a lot of veggies this is the book for you. I use this book mainly for the ideas, and go from there. Lots of pictures, well written, well organized."
1,Horrible,"Okay so it's not horrible if you're a sexist lazy male looking for the perfect life/wife. I wasted my money on this anime thinking it was a shojou, and what did I get? Like everyone else is saying, this is not an anime for girls. I hated Love Hina and everything else so if you're a dummy like me (who loves animes like Fushigi Yuugi), don't buy this, don't even waste your time looking at it."
2,Not very funny. The plot is really BAAAAD!,"This series starts with a bad plot.I heard it was as good as Love Hina. I have not gotten a chance to see Love Hina. If that is so, I will give both up.Graphically, it is very crisp and clean with beautiful colors. All characters are cute. The music and songs are ""cute"". But, the plot .... I could not laugh although it is supposed to be a comedy!Two stars are covering the technical parts of the DVD."
1,annoying weakling girl,"If you like your heroines strong and independent, this is not the anime for you. Aoi is sweet, but lives to cater to Kaoru, who she believes she is in love with- even though she knew him as a child, and hasn't seen him in 18 years. It makes her happy to cook and clean for him, and that's about it! Disgusting, I could barely get through these 5 episodes! What a waste of time!"
4,Exactly what I thought it would be,"This is taken straight from the manga, word for word. This made it boring to watch because I knew what was going to happen.The animation is beautiful, and the voice acting is fairly well-done in both versions. But I found the story to be rather cliched."
2,An enjoyable anime for more ametuer shonens.,"After watching all the episodes of Ai Yori Aoshi and it's sequel Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi, I've concluded that this series was not meant for girls. With alot of cliche scenes and false drama, only inexperienced drama veiewers were allowed to enjoy this. I also disliked both endings. Both felt like they were rushed and the entire series seems like there was no goal, unlike is Love Hina were Keitaro wishes to be with Naru but in Ai Yori Aoshi Kouru already has Aoi. I thing I did like was the title, Bluer than Indigo. In the end, I recommend instead READING Love Hina or Ichigo 100%."
1,Didn't enjoy it...,"I bought Ai Yori Aoshi on a whim, after hearing things like, ""If your a fan of Love Hina and Hand Maid May, you'll love this!"" What a lie.I usually love harem-shows, but not this one.I don't exactly know why I don't like it. Maybe that it's the fact Aoi is too persistent on becoming Kaoru's wife.I really didn't like this one bit, and I hope I never come across another show as boring as Ai Yori Aoshi."
4,I like her style,I like the writer's style. Brings you in to the story and makes you want to know what happens next. There were errors that other reviewers referenced but they did not stop me from getting into the story. For me this book was a quick entertaining read that I read it in one sitting. I loved the ending and I really hope that there is a part two available or at least in the works.
5,Would make a great movie,I loved this story and I hope there is a sequel. I loved the ending of this book. Great writing style.
5,Well worth your time to read,"I found the book to be very interesting and filled with inspirational material. It is remarkable how much Bill and his wife, Vonette, accomplished. After I read it, I gave it to my adult son (for whom reading is not the pleasure it is for me) and he read the entire book and told me how much it meant to him.I am writing this only because one reader gave it such a low rating. The book does have a lot of detail in the last half. However, to have left out the detail would have left the book incomplete in my view."
5,Jeff Porcaro's finest recorded performance!,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a bigger fan of the late Jeff Porcaro than me, and this CD represents the awesome drummer that Jeff was and the chops that he had (the chops he always DENIED that he had because he was so humble) when he really cut loose and played free better than any recording I've ever heard. Thank God someone was there on that magical night and recorded this performance. There is simply no greater gift to true Jeff Porcaro fans than this recording. Get it if you love JP, no matter what the cost. You won't be sorry. It's unreal!"
2,Alright,"I was hoping this was going to be like Bruce Almighty. Funny, entertaining, unique. Unfortunately, this wasn't. It's great for families but slow on laughs--mostly just awkward--and well...just slow. Evan is no Bruce and the only character that kept my attention was God."
2,Boring...........................,Universal Studios doled out about $175 million dollars or more for this Biblical comedy -- forgot that no one laughs in Sunday school. They sleep through it.I was very disappointed....
1,I fell asleep,"My mom bought this movie brand new for four bucks at a local retail store. If you paid more for this film, then you got ripped off. Its not really funny and I only laughed a few times. Steve Carell can be funny but he seems restrained thru out the film, perhaps because it was PG. Anywho, this movie was not funny and it was pretty dumb."
2,Had its moments,"This movie has its moments. Some terribly annoying ones, and some horrendous overacting by Steve Carell, and some fairly entertaining and touching moments.The overacting by Carell got so bad at one point in the middle of the movie, that I almost turned it off. His sense of humor is better suited to be subdued. He can't pull off a complete off-the-wall comedic sequence like Jim Carrey. No one can, for the most part. Towards the end of the movie, he toned it down, and the movie became watchable.Overall, not a very good movie at all. Had a few decent moments, but overall, a highly forgettable film."
3,Good Family Movie,I would say its a solid Family Movie. Something the adults and children can both enjoy. I highly recomend it for a family night in.
1,cosmic clown,"Not funny. Saw it on TV and was inspired to say this is worse than you might even suspect. If there were a god that reaveled himself to the world like this I wouldn't like him. Well, I guess in the Bible god does do stuff like this and that's why I didn't like him. What a jerk.""not to be nit-picky, but the tsunami-like disaster that overtakes Washington, D.C., looks as though it would snuff out the lives of quite a few citizens"" --From the Amazon review. LOL. That part was funny."
1,"Funny movie, but ...",Funny movie but it does not include either spanish audio or spanish subtitles in HD version. What is happening with Universal Studios? Why do they include spanish subtitles in SD version and not in HD version. It stinks.
3,Where's Bruce?,Ok...Steve Carell is hilarious but this movie was not all that great. I was expecting something a lot better considering Bruce Almighty made me get off my seat and laugh out loud. The movie had it's good points. Great movie to sit back to and watch with the family.All through out the movie I was asking myself...Where is Bruce?
5,Excellent movie...,Hysterically funny. I loved this movie. I wasn't going to watch it because I thought Bruce Almighty was not up to par but being stuck on an airplane can make you get desperate. I laughed so hard the first time and then the second when watching it with my family. There is one scene where you know Evan is naked but hollywood spared us the usual butt shot and just made it where you knew he was naked but couldn't seen any private parts.I definitely recommend this movie!
2,Nonsense,"Let's see... what will you get when you see this movie? Pretty basic gags, some minor sexual double sense jokes, corny dialogs, all messed up (mashed up) with biblical stuff, which I don't think is wrong but here is forced to the limit of incredulous.I'd only recommend this movie only if you want to spare some time and don't have anything more important to do. Forgettable."
5,Funny with a message,"I enjoyed this one more than Bruce Almighty. No dirty humor. It's a fun time with a message, as always, Steve Carell is hilarious and Morgan Freeman is great."
2,Doesn't compare...,"I know it's a different person doing practically the same movie. It really does not compare to ""Bruce"" and has maybe half the laughs. Worth the time to rent, just glad that I did not go to the theater to see it. I really like Carrell's other movies, but this one just did not stack up to my expectations. Morgan is great as always in his role as the big man on high."
2,Waste of Talent,"With an all-star cast like this one, I was expecting big laughs.I was very disappointed.Steve Carell and Lauren Graham had NO chemistry. Both extremely talented, but no chemistry.The story was really slow, and kind of pointless. I just wanted them to finish the damn ark already! Some of the slapstick was overdone, I might add. The animals were a bit much.When you watch a 1/2-hour episode of The Office, or an hourlong episode of Gilmore Girls, it feels like half that. Here, it felt double. I was waiting for it to end.Like the title of my review says, it was a waste of talent. Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Carell, and Graham are all extremely talented entertainers. I hope they fired their agents after this one."
1,Evan Al...meh,"The sole reason I rented this was A.) Steve Carrel is tolerable, and can be hilarious now & again, and B.) to get a free rental.Didn't care for Bruce Almighty, as someone who isn't particularly entertained by bread & butter simple mortality tales, so why I took an hour and a half for this I have no clue, but at least the Gilmore MILF is hot.God this, faith that, stick to your guns this, big corporations are bad that, good, evil, and a dog in the end. ""ask and you shall receive"" was the thing that made me laugh the loudest, actually.I can appreciate religious films, but when it's this loaded with cheese, it brings me to the brink of vomiting."
3,"Silly. Fun, but silly.","The Supreme Being decides that a junior politician needs to re-enact the Noah thing in a DC suburb. Make sense? No? If not, then I described it correctly.Lots of sight gags and a predictably happy ending. That's about it.-- wiredweird"
5,Great movie with a great message.,"I was pleasantly surprised when this movie was not irreverent, as I had expected. It had a great message about integrity and courage in the face of many odds. I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,Very entertaining movie,"I really enjoyed very much this movie. Is a comedy that the whole family can watch and at the same time is an uplifting movie. It's a pity that the format is 2.35, I really hate those black bars, the only reason which I didn't buy it. But every time I have a chance to watch it on HBO High Definition I do, it looks gorgeous on my 46 inch TV. I really are not in favor of those that predicate that movies should be seen as they were intended to be seen by the director. This a commercial movie and not an art film where maybe the composition of the frame is what makes the movie a masterpiece. This just a plain movie to enjoy, and not to see it halfscreen instead of widescreen. HBO has the right view, this is more entertainment than art. Wish the directors would choose to film their movies in 1.85 so that at last we could get rid of the black bars. Anyhow this is a very good and entertaining comedy that I highly recomend."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great either","In Evan Almighty, God chooses a newly-elected congressman to build an arc in anticipation of another flood and reminiscent of Noah's feat.The acting is pretty good, the plot is just average, while the humor is decent.In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.No masterpiece here..."
2,Steve is better than this!,A friend and I watched this together and almost didn't finish it. Steve Carrel is a great comedian and actor but this was a waste of time. And to think that Morgan Freeman signed on too!!
4,"Great movie, so funny","My husband and I loved this movie. It is wholesome, funny, and teaches lessons. Its about God telling this guy to build an ark in modern day times. Its about his willingness to be faithful and to do what he is called to do even when he doesnt understand and about his family supporting him. It teaches us how to listen and follow God, how His plans are not ours, and combines it with funny humorous moments throughout the movie. I laughed out loud. One scene shows him sitting on the couch with a fish tank behind him and the fish follow him no matter where he sits(because he's the modern Noah), as he trys to shoo them away! So funny, you have to see it.This is the kind of comedy we need, not more sexual, nasty mouthed comedy. This movie was refreshing and so fun to watch!!!"
4,Very funny :),"Good story, lots of laughs. Has an environmental message and a don't let work be your life message and a God knows what's best for you message and all without seeming preachy."
4,Evan Almighty starring Steve Carell,"We thoroughly enjoyed this movie when we originally viewed it at a theater when it was originally released. We purchased it so that we could view it multiple times at home, and also purchased a copy as a Christmas gift for a family member who is a Steve Carell fan. We've only recently begun purchasing at Amazon, were very pleasantly surprised by the excellent service, and will be utilizing it in the future."
4,Hey It's got Morgan Freeman in it!,"So that probably added one extra star for me. For a quick fun watch, this movie isn't bad. And Morgan is awesome."
3,A little too dry for my taste,"I was led to believe that this was a pretty simple cookbook that would help my wife with her weight control program. Instead, although it did contain receipts, it was written more like a doctorial thesis, only lacking volumnious footnotes to refer the reader to what the author was writing about. Thank you for giving me the chance to tell the world about it."
2,not so great,"I got this book on accident ( I thought I was ordering the Schwarzbein Principle), but since I had it, I thought I would go through it. The recipes weren't very creative and the book contained no pictures (something I think to be important in cookbooks). For a good cookbook, look elsewhere..."
3,Schwarzbein Principle,To much reading before getting to the diet. I would have perfered to have the diet explained in the begining of the book and why it works near the end.
3,Balanced Meals made easy,This is a great cookbook. I have already made several dishes and even my picky eaters have loved them. The average preparation time is less than 20 minutes for most and they have easy to find ingredients.
3,Ok Cookbook,"Like most cookbooks, I gleen some great tips and find a few special recipes that I use over and over. This book is like that so I am satisfied. I do appreciate the nutritional breakdown and portion sizes."
5,Must Buy!,"This is the BEST Cookbook I've every owned. Finally a cookbook where I can diet, and my whole family not only will eat it, but loves everything I've made! I feel like a gourmet cook, yet very simple cooking, & I've lost weight while eating yummy food! This is a must buy!"
2,The Schwarzbein Principle Cookbook,"I've subscribed to a lifestyle change following low-carb eating and recipes. With over 35 years of meal preparation under my belt, I wanted a cookbook to give me unique ideas as well as gourmet-quality recipes. While this cookbook offered interesting combinations, I was extremely disappointed. Yes, there are 300 recipes, but the same preparation and ingredients are used over and over again ad nauseum. Different meat, new recipe name, same ingredients. Very repetitive. It is, however a very good beginners cookbook. As long as you have garlic, green pepper, cilantro, and a few other ""basics"" you will enjoy this book; if you're looking for ingredients beyond those you've used for years, look somewhere else, you probably already know how to put these dishes together yourself. I would call this book a great primer for the beginning cook who doesn't cook by experience, rather, needs a step by step guidelines. An experienced cook will be disapointed."
5,A GOOD FOOD cookbook,"Although I originally purchased The Schwartzbien Principle Cookbook to follow Dr. Schwartzbien's get healthy eating plan I fell so in love with her recipes that I use them whether I'm ""being good"" or not. My husband and my son rave over the meals I make from this cookbook. They are all relatively easy to make and don't use too many ingedients. My mother was visiting over Christmas and I made one of the recipes and she asked where I got it. I handed her the cookbook and after reading the intro and a few recipes she asked me to order the book for her and have it sent to her house so it would be there when she got home. If you want to feel like you are eating restaurant food at home these recipes will do it."
2,Not that low carb...,"I expected a greater variety of delicious recipes in this book (for some reason!) Suzanne Somers had Dr. Schwarzbein in some of her books and I guess I expected really tasty, low carb recipes. So many of these recipes are just not all that great! And rice is not low carb; some recipes have 20-30 or more carbs per serving. I guess I just expected better from this cookbook."
4,Good cookbook,"I haven't made anything from this cookbook yet, but after browsing through it I am pleased that I bought it. The recipes look easy, sound delicious, and I like the fact that all of the nutritional info. is listed."
2,just bad,"I would have checked this out even if it wasn't a Michael Kang movie. But after seeing ""the motel"" i was definately excited to see this film. Wow i was wrong! First thing first, John Cho was horribly casted as the korean-american lawyer. Nothing against him but it was just uncomfortable seeing him in these scenes. There wasn't much action in the film, it just seemed to slowly drag on with boring dialogue to finally end. I watched it twice and the second viewing was almost unbearable."
2,Bad taste improves as you chew.,"The first thing that you think when you start chewing is that the person who gave these to you is an awful human being. Within a few seconds, though, the sharp taste dulls and you think that maybe this person isn't pure evil after all."
1,Too Large for Travel,"When I opened the package from Amazon containing the toothbrush holder and other plastic travel items (soap box and razor holder) from Radius, I was shocked to see how large they were. If you travel a lot, as I do, size is really important and these products would take up much too large a space in a suitcase. In addition, the items were far from waterproof, another criteria factor for travel."
2,You can't choose the color.,Toothbrush fits nicely but I didn't get the option of choosing the color. I received a pink case and was upset because I'm a guy!
1,Not the right size!,"Advertised as specifically appropriate for the Radius toothbrush, which is thick and angled, requiring a non-standard toothbrush case. It is neither broad enough nor does it accomodate the angled head. It is durable, but not useful for regular toothbrushes as the clasp is too difficult to undo, and the hinge appears unlikely to last more than a very few uses. Not recommended."
3,still looks new,"bought this a long time ago. it still looks new. but from time to time it gets a dirty gunk in it, even though i keep my toothbrush clean."
3,A good review,"This book offers a good review for anyone who is preparing to take an AP exam in Government. The Comparaitive section is a bit out dated and has some old essay questions, but the Multiple choice tests are good for both American and Comparative."
2,"Short, uninformative, poor exams, and occasional mistakes.","I was very dissappointed with this book. Friends of mine who had used the REA American History reveiw highly recommended the series. However, I found the subject reveiw in this edition to be incredably small. It left out major topics from the exam. In addition, the practice exams were extremely poor. The questions were badly worded, with more than one answer being correct. The diagrams were atrocious; in one graph, the lines used to plot two variables were identical. There were also questions where the books answers were wrong; in one instance, I found an answer justifyed by the fact that, and I quote:""Committee chairmanships in the House... are generally given to the member of the majority party (Democratic) that has served the longest..."" This is from a book copywritten in 1998, claiming that which has not been true since 1994. Therefore, I feel that this book should only be used if there is absolutely no other available text."
5,Gets the core of what you need to know,"The Comparative part is largely useless ofcourse because they come out with new countries every year. However, the US government part was right on. It doesn't go into every detail that you need to know, but it gets through enough material so that a student cramming would find this book golden. Buy it for a quick review before the test, not as a study guide througout the year and you will love it."
5,a great short biography of Caesar,"I enjoy history when it's well-written, and this book is just a model of how I wish all historians would write. It's a smart, succinct history of one of the most fascinating men who's ever lived, and it's accessible to folks who don't know a lot about classical history already. The maps and background information are just perfect, and you get a sense of why and how Caesar had such an enormous impact on his world. I know it's cliche, but this biography really brings him alive for a modern reader. Strongly recommended!"
1,Not what I thought I was ordering,"I thought I was ordering the HEPA replacement filter. What I got was the replacement PRE-filter, which is also labeled micro HEPA. With no part number and no picture there is no way of knowing what you are buying. I'll be returning the item.Just found out they charge a 15% restocking fee as well as shipping to return the item. Quite an expensive mistake!"
5,Good Microsoft N-tier Architecture Text,"Solid information for those interested in building N-tier architectures in a Microsoft world. Great stuff on how to build business objects -- I haven't found much on Microsoft object caching except in this book. Sadly, MS hasn't gone as deep as JBoss, BroadVision or similar products but this book helps fill the gap."
2,Verbose and unfocused,"While this tome does have some useful information in it, the reader would be better served by reading a single case study in which the reader actually learns how to produce a real-world solution. This book attempts to provide coverage of a wide range of topics in a disjointed and rambling fashion. Heavy on theory, light on application, the reader is bored silly after the first hundred pages and is referred to Microsoft's website for case studies worth anything. The title of this book (and the reason people buy it) is very misleading. A more accurate title would be something like ""A sampling of distributed application technologies -- past and present."" This book has a purely academic tone to it. The bottom line is -- theory won't put bread on the table, unless of course you are a writer or a professor. Good luck."
2,Failed after light usage.,"Ultra light use in my home office - after 2nd set of staple refills it just started making a quiet ""pop-pop-pop"" sound and refused to continue. It was not jammed - it had failed completely. I messed around a bit with making sure that the solenoid wasn't stuck or that a wire wasn't lose.This thing sounds like someone is hitting your desk with a hammer as hard as they can."
4,The BEST electric stapler,"We recently received the stapler & it is the BEST one we've had. This is the first time we've used this product but it will not be the last. As it was suggested in the ad, we bought the same brand staples. Our reports are all going out on time now. Great product.I did't give it five stars because we haven't had it that long. So far it's performing at a five star level."
1,This is NOT for Heavy Usage! May be appropriate if used once or twice a week,"Hi Guys!I know more about this ProductStanley Bostitch Electric Full Strip 20 Sheet Capacity Stapler With Anti-Jam Mechanism (02210)probably more than anyone else. I use this at my work place on a daily basis for almost 200 to 300 times a day. The stapler breaks down frequently and they have replaced about 2 staplers in the last 3 months. To speak the truth, this can only be useful for a small home office, where this is used only once or twice a week! I feel for my employer because they have a contract with this stupid company which would not replace for a better one but instead, replace the same stapler over and over again."
2,too bad,"After a few good months, the stapler is no longer stapeling, I am using the recommended staples and it will shoot one but the next one no staple comes out, I can get it to shoot again by popping open the magazine but if I have to press a button for each staple I may as well use a hand stapler. Will try to return directly to Bostitch and see what happens."
2,"Worked for several years, but then became unusable",I used this lightly for several years. It worked OK until all of a sudden it just jammed and could not be un-jammed. There was no way to open it up and fix it.
2,"good stapler, but...","This stapler does the job, but it does not allow you to adjust where the staple staples. I wish I had known that or thought of checking before I bought it as I would have purchased a different one. Otherwise it works okay for jobs where it doesn't matter where you staple."
2,"OK for a few months, now problems","We use this in our office for stapling invoices to packing slips. Usually 2-4 pages, sometimes as many as 8-10, but never 20.Yes, it's noisy, but we didn't care.but it has started ""blank"" stapling - that is it strikes the papers, but no staple comes out unless I push the button on top to open the loading tray and then push it back in again. then it will staple 2-4 times, then I have to do the open trick again.I have tried 2 different brands of staples in case my cheap staples from Quill were a problem - Swingline staples do the same thing = it's the stapler.I'm not sure what to buy next.;We had a Swingline electric with a cartridge and had lots of problems with it.Annoyed in Richmond, Calif"
2,Broken already?,"This stapler worked great for almost 4 months. Now it cannot recognize that the staples are loaded in, the red ""out of staples"" light is always on, and it will not staple. No visable problem, but it does not work. I'm going to order something sturdier."
4,One word - GREAT!,"I use a staple constanting at work and tend to push it to it's limits with the amount of pages it can staple through. I decided to purchase this electric stapler because my hand started to hurt from the excessive pressure I was putting on it from hitting the manual stapler. I can't go through as many pages as I use to with the manual stapler, but I can write again. Writing is better."
1,Lasted less than 2 months,"This stapler lasted less than 2 months. It worked ok for most of the time I had it. It sat on my desk, was never banged around, and never came close to stapling the full 20 sheet capacity. Typically only stapled 2 - 5 pages at a time. Died suddenly without warning. Do not buy this stapler, not worth the money."
2,Mine Lasted only 2 years,"I was very happy with my Bostich Electric Stapler for 2 years. It just stopped working and there's nothing you can do about it, since there's no way to open the carcass to check what's wrong inside. Now I'm back to the old cheap manual stapler that I have for over 20 years."
1,VERY loud. broke down after several months,"This stapler used to be near my desk at work and the very loud noise actually caused me physical pain after a while. Keep this out of the classroom particularly kids in special education, who may be hypersensitive to noise. It did the job but it broke down after several months."
1,The stapler only lasted three months,"I bought this product to use in my third grade classroom. It does look bullet proof. The stapling mechanism lasted about a year. I, too, thought I just got a lemon, so I re-ordered the same product. The second one lasted about three months. I don't do heavy stapling, usually no more than 5 sheets at a time. I find it is a bit difficult to get the drawer open so that you can reload it, also."
1,Lasted 2.5 whole months. although hardly used,Purchased this stapler from Amazon less than 3 months ago. Comes with no manual or any support material for troubleshooting. Died without a whimper even though used sparingly. Feels like throwing moneay away. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!
2,Bad design,"This seems like a good unit until it starts to not trigger when you try to staple something. the construction is sturdy to say the least. Bombproof actually. The problem is that inside (I broke it apart after it totally failed entirely to work) there is a circuit board that is connected to the trigger. The circuit board is just behind where any fowled up staples will often get ejected to when the unit is triggered but there's no paper to staple into (a symptom you'll likely experience after a while). The problem is that the used staples fall back into the stapler and then land on top of the circuit board which causes it to short out and malfunction (will finally ""shoot"" the staple seconds after you've triggered it (inserted paper to staple). by the time it ""shoots"" you've already removed the paper because it's clearly not working correctly. If they'd just somehow cover up the circuit board to keep these stray used staples from landing on it, the unit would be great. stupid design mistake."
1,Quit after a month!,It worked fine for a few weeks except if to few or to many pages were involved. Two or three sheets sometimes would not trip the switch without holding both sides of the papers. twenty sheets sometimes would stick in the machine after it stapled. It died after four weeks.
1,It did not work.,Tried to staple with it lots of times and it only stapled one time. I sent it back and purchased one from Stealth Office Supplies that worked. Still have not seen the refund on our company bank statement come through.
2,"Good, while it lasts!","Our office buys these exclusively. I'm hoping that we can figure something else out, because they're shoddy at best. I personally have gone through three of them in a year. They work great at first and then just fail. Between the jamming, and not stapling period, it's frustrating!! I would expect more from this company."
1,Bostitch electric desk top stapler,Only worked for about 3 days. Now it eats the ends of the paper and keeps jamming. Unfortunately my hubby threw out the box that it came in or I would be sending it back. Was so excited to get it as it saves me a lot of time for work.......really frustrated it did not work out. Only four pages max that I was stapling. Thought if I purchased a bit more expensive one that it would not be junk. Spend the money so you don't deal with the let down.
1,"Broke, Terrible Return Policy","This item broke and would not work at all just outside of the Amazon return date. I contacted the manufacturer to find out Stanley had sold off their office supply division. To get this fixed, I had to mail it to them at MY OWN COST (over $13) and wait over a month to get a new one. Don't think you're dealing with a big company. The new owners run a real mickey mouse operation."
4,good solid performer,"I bought this to replace a fancy Swingline model that jammed beyond repair. While this unit does not have adjustable depth (it wouldn't stay fixed anyway on the Swingline) it has a good solid punch to it, and staples once not two or three times like the other one."
1,You have to use two hands!,"papers MUST be pulled straight and taught with both your hands before it triggers. Sometimes you can get away with a one handed stapling but usually you sit there jamming it in and out 10+ times before it detects it.oh, and it is LOUD. Ridiculously loud piercing snap with a ring afterwards. The loudest thing that ever happens in the office is this stapler. the whole office can hear it. Tried dampening the noise with dynamat, didn't help at all.Staplers should be easy, not hard. This is simple stuff, I thought this was a premium product to make my office a bit nicer but no.I even tried buying ""premium"" staples that cost 5x as much and come in a special little tin, that didn't help. Tried cleaning it with q-tips, nothing works.donotbuy"
1,Amazon Bought Stanley Bostitich Electric Stapler(02210),This stapler was just returned to Amazon as it is defective...only worked for less than one month. It will only staple once. Then you must open up and close and repeat the process. I would not recommend this at all...no stars. Had to actually give one star in order to send this.
1,"Used to be good, now they're making crap.","I've had the same exact model on my desk at work for 5 years, and it's worked flawlessly.So, I finally bought one for my home office. Worked for exactly three staples, then the sensor died. Amazon was very quick to provide a replacement. But after a few uses, it too stopped stapling. Upon inspection, a pin fell out, no idea where it goes. This is going back too. Will now try a different brand.Not sure what changed in their manufacturing the past 5 years, but it's definitely a change for the worse.Don't buy this stapler!"
5,Staples confusing,This is a very satisfactory stapler. I did have problems with staples and Bostitch's product codes when I tried to find replacement staples. It seems like you get led to the hunch-back variety and these will not fit in the magazine. Swingline S.F.4 stasples fit the machine and work.
5,WOW! AUTHOR GETS THIS ONE RITGHT!,"This is definately a Political Expose.The Author gives a sincere and truthful insightto what has happened in Cuba before Castro, during Castroas well as some unknown facts to many about what wenton for the Cuban Citizens during the Bay of Pig invasion.This book covers it all when it comes to Cuba.This book is timely and essential reading for students thatneed to understand the power of the USA Liberal Media and afterreading this book they will be able to set some of their Historyteachers straight on the failure of Communism in Cuba under Castro.The author allows you to get deep into this book, and you are able to visualize his fathers memoirs, strugles as well as their flight to freedom.I congratulate this author for his courage to pour out so much truth."
3,Good but not great,"Once again the Aussie Radio Station has put out a great CD. Unfortunately it is lacking a few of the best tracks that were in the hottest 100, probably due to licensing. Still worth having in your collection."
2,Not As Pictured,This screwdriver has a flimsy plastic cap on the end to hold the bits. The bits are just loose inside the screwdriver and rattle around. Overall poorly designed and the cap feels like it will fall off at any moment.
1,Item not as pictured.,"I was expecting a high quality screwdriver, such as the one in the picture. I received a made in china piece of junk that was bought at a different store and still had the price tag on it. I wish amazon would carry a good screwdriver so I would not have to order from 3rd party sellers. Do not buy this it is not what is pictured."
3,A Clean Sweep?,"Anyone thinking that Poland was the sole or worst of ethnic ""cleansers,"" should read the authentic reports from Czechoslovakia, particularly Prague, when innocent German civilians (men, women, children and babies) were brutally murdered in public places, by hordes of ""postwar partisans,"" who were apparently eager to outdo the sadistic killers of the Middle Ages. I recommend ""Defeat in the East"" by Juergen Thorwald (pages 228-251), althouth it is not the only record of ""man's inhumanity to man"" after WWII."
3,Last Man Standing,"Walter Hill's nod to the gangster and western genres. Bruce Willis rocks, but if you're not into semi cheesy action, steer clear. However, there is Christopher Walken, and who can resist!"
3,"Same as ""a fistful of Dollars""","Has nobody noticed the story of ""last Man Standing"" it's exactly the same as in the movie ""a Fistful Of Dollars"".One man playing two families off against one another. A woman and her child. Everythings the same, except for the time period that is.I liked the version with Clint Eastwood better."
1,Awful!,"One of the silliest pretexts for a movie, ever! This film has all the substance of an AT&T commercial, and the ""story"" is nothing more than one establishing shot after another. After about an hour and a half, we get to see Christopher Walken and Bruce Willis eyeball each other and act macho... That's if we haven't fallen asleep or otherwise lost interest by that time.At this time, you can buy a used VHS edition of this movie for $.49 on amazon, but at less than a half a buck, it's still not worth it..."
2,A Wasteful Two Hours Watching a Rehash Of Old Westerns,"""LAST MAN STANDING"" IS A REMAKE OF KUROSAWA'S CLASSIC ""YOJIMBO"" WITH SOME WESTERN FILM CLICHES THROWN IN FOR GOOD MEASURE. WITH THIS IN MIND ""LAST MAN STANDING"" IS AN ENTERTAINNG MEANS OF WASTING TWO HOURS ON LOTS OF GUN PLAY AND PATHETIC TOUGH GUY LINES TO WIPE AWAY ANY EMPTY FEELINGS LEFT BY A LACKLUSTER SCRIPT. THE FILM'S BIGGEST DOWNFALL IS THE PLOT BASEICALLY STEALING IDEAS FROM EVERY WESTERN AND GANGSTER FILM EVER MADE. THE PLOT: 1931 TWO RIVAL GANGS FACE OFF TO CONTROL THE ILIEGAL LIQUOR TRADE IN COMES JOHN SMITH,A LONER WHO PLAYS BOTH SIDES AGAINST ONE ANOTHER, SOUNDS FAMILLIAR? ""LAST MAN STANDING"" PROBABLY SETS A RECORD FOR FILM PREDICTABILLTY IT'S THE ONLY FILM I'VE SEEN WHERE THE ENDING CAN ACCURALTY BE PREDICTATED SIMPLY BY HEARING THE TITLE. BRUCE WILLIS IS THE ONLY REASON TO GO RENT THIS FILM, HE PLAYS THIS CHRACTER VERY WELL WITH NO HELP FROM HIS CO-STARS."
2,a good story... poorly done,"I wish to keep this short, so I'll only say this: I liked this movie better the first time-- when it was called 'A Fistfull of Dollars'."
1,Horrendous,One of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. I'd rather watch a woman giving birth BARF
5,it was awsome!,The movie was great!Bruce willis was awesome in it he was the perfect person for the part!the sound of the gunfights are spectacular!Dont miss this movie
2,"The Credit may be Correct, but it's More Like the Original Book","While this film is credited as being a remake of ""Yojimbo"", it is actually a lot closer (and not just because it's set in Prohibition USA) to that film's uncredited-but-admitted source, Dashiell Hammett's ""Continental Op"" novel, ""Red Harvest"".As usual, the over-rated Walter Hill goes for Existential Cinema, but mostly manages to deliver a rather silly story with well-staged action sequences. (To see these tendencies full-blown in Hill's work, try ""The Driver"".)If you have a couple of days worth of spare time, you might want to read ""Red Harvest"", wacth ""Yojimbo"", ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and this film, and polish it all off with SF author David Drake's take on the story, ""The Sharp End"", to see how several journeyman-to-master creators handled the same material..."
3,"Bruce shoots his gun again, can be fun","Bruce came back briefly for this ultra-violent tale of deceit in the dustbowl of the prohibition era in this flick. It can be boring, but it can be fun and has some pretty good lines in it (In a voice over, we see Bruce sitting alone on a porch telling us (paraphrased) ""I didn't have anything to drink for two days. And for me, that's a long time."" Christopher Walked also breaks things up with his typical evil demeanor, and in the end we really don't know if good prevailed what with all the shooting. But it's not all Bruce Willis. The director, Walter Hill, seems to relish in fantastic gunplay, sometimes ridiculous but at the same time still pretty cool, in a weird way."
2,not bad,got me engaged for the almost half the movie then it got redundant and boring. in general i don't recommend this because it has too much violence and teaches violence which is not what we need.
5,Bruce Willis as a gangster!!,"The time is the 1920's, maybe. The scene is south Texas. Bruce Willis is a loner, heading to Mexico. He comes across a small, one horse town, and drives right into the middle of a gang war. Violence is definitely the name of the game in this one, but these guys play for keeps! Lots of shoot-em-up scenes and lots of actions as Willis tries to play both sides of the street."
5,Last Man Standing,What's not to like about two gun shooting? It's a classic story. I believe Clint Eastwood made a similar story but in a western
4,MY AMAZON,"PLEASED WITH MOST OF MY ORDERS. MY COMPUTER PURCHASED THIS LAST TIME I LOVE, AND SAVED MONEY BUYING FROM AMAZON. ALSO NO TROUBLE SETTING IT UP. GREAT DEAL!"
4,Underrated,"Everyone makes mention of this film being a so-called remake of Yojimbo, but what they fail to mention is that this is in fact the closest we have come to a faithful adaptation of Red Harvest, the masterful Dashiell Hammett novel that Yojimbo (and yes, A Fistful of Dollars) was based on. It's far from a perfect movie, but it captures a lot of the feel of the novel and is definitely worth checking out for fans of hard-boiled fiction. It also improves upon multiple viewings, unlike a lot of modern action movies."
4,Last Man Standing dvd,"This Bruce Willis action movie is pretty good for its exposition/narration ala 1920-40's investigation monologues and the plot is decent. There's lots of gunplay (the .45s that Willis uses throughout the movies humorously blow bad guys away- literally) and the sets are great. Some good characters here, like Christopher Walken's ""Hickey"".You won't find any brilliant acting or powerful scenes, but there's not a lot of flaws beyond mediocre things. For its price, this was a good dvd purchase."
3,Good movie.,This is one of those movies you either really like or really don't like. I like the way the story develops. The acting is maybe not the best but it does keep you guessing. I liked the coloring of the movie which made it seem more barren and remote.
1,More of an old western film,"Last Man Standing did not really interest me much and thought was kind of boring. It reminded me of an old western shoot-um up movie and did not think was a good fit for Bruce Willis. Guess if you like western movies than could enjoy it but don't think would appeal to many viewers outside of people who like those type of movies. I do like older movies but never found westerns to be very interesting, they just seem to bore me. Maybe for the die hard Willis fan or die hard fan of westerns only.Peter J. Miller"
1,very bad,well i got this excited to have a rubik's cube and what happens in the first five minutes it breaks. it is very bad it feels like its made out of card board i don't recommend this rubik's cube
3,Not whats pictured,This product is ok but its defiantly not the same as the picture. The box is all Chinese and not the Rubik's brand.
3,not as bright as pictured,"We own a real Rubik's cube, and this one was not like it. It came in Asian packaging with English as the secondary instructions. The colors are a weird shade of the normal colors and it moves oddly even to me as a mom. It hasn't fallen apart in 3 days, and he has played with it a lot. I don't think our nine-year-old son notices those differences, but I did notice along with his older brother that own's a real rubik's cube."
1,Awful knock-off product,"This is not a Rubik's Cube, and the seller is being misleading by calling it that. This is a cheap Chinese knock-off of a Rubik's Cube. It wouldn't turn properly and broke within 20 minutes of use. Don't trust these guys and don't trust this product."
1,company logos are on mine,"When this arrived, it had some company's logo on the center peg. See that clean picture they have? Yeah, that's not what I got."
3,So Hard!,"This thing is so hard, whenever i tried i got so fustrated i coundn't see straight! but my sister (her nickname i will tell you not) was able to do it really fast! i mixed it up, and she would be able to do it!i would be carefull with this. if you are bad with puzzles, do not mix it or you will never get it back together again.if you cannot do this one do not get the circle one that does not have square peices."
1,"Poor Quality New Ones, Only Good if it's Old","These new cubes use very cheap plastic and are stiff to turn. A piece snapped in two the first day. It was unrepairable. When I returned it to the store, even the clerk commented that the quality is terrible (the plastic feels light-weight and flimsy).I've been playing with the Rubik's Cube since the 1980s. I got this new cube with the collector stand as a replacement for my over 10-year-old cube (which still works, but the decals are beginning to chip off).I recommend the Rubik's Cube only if you can find an older one. You will know it's older because the blue and white sides are opposite each other. Avoid the ones where you can see red, white and blue at the same time like the one pictured here. These will be the poor-quality, new ones. They break too easily and you will be very disappointed."
1,Not a Rubik's Cube,"Despite the picture, this is NOT a Rubik's Cube. It is a Chinese knock-off and doesn't even bother to say Rubik's Cube on it. It says ""Three-layer magic puzzle"". Very disappointed."
1,terrible,this is a disaster. the cube feels extremely uncomfortable and is ready to crumble. I suggest no one to buy it.
1,do not buy,this is not the product that you see in the picture. you will get a block that falls apart as soon as you take it out of the box and is not a Rubik's Cube.
2,Fake,"The image displayed is not the real product. It is a fake. I thought i was getting the original rubik's cube. It doesnt even come in the correct package displayed, it comes in a grey box. It is flimsy, the corners separate easily."
2,fake rubiks cube,"This ended up being a fake Rubiks cube and not as durable. I would not purchase it again. Rubiks cubes, in general, are fantastic and educational. They help children learn mathematical solutions."
5,Speed Cubing Rocks!,This is my 3rd Rubiks cube (I tend to lose things) and it is just as amazing as the last two! I started learning to cube a few months ago and it was great. I can now get the cube done in under a minute and sometimes with my eyes closed!!The challenge of solving it was so much fun and it is super impressive to solve it in front of people. Learn this at a young age and you will be able to impress people for years to come!I have taught about 5 people a basic method of solving it and one of them was able to learn in just 4 hours! So instead of watching TV learn this and you will love it! Have fun everyone!
4,Big Helper,"This stapler works well for us. It's a tad bit heavier and doesn't use batteries, making it less portable. Not crazy about the color, but it's highly functional for our heavy use. Also, there's no way to lock the paper guide in position. For our users that are heavy handed in pushing the paper against the guide, we have to periodically readjust it to staple closer to the edge of the paper."
4,Achtung,"hey its a bunch of photos of skinheads in the early 80's...Not bad, I like it. The skinhead look is after all timeless and smart! Of course in the last 20 plus years tattoos have certainly improved. Well worth having I believe. However Im sure it can be found for a far more modest price than seventy bucks! Oh dear..."
4,Utterly Fascinating,"This documentary gives a very rare behind the scenes look at the life of Farah Diba. It is astonishing that she allowed such access to her life, given that she lives in exile from a very hostile dictatorship. The film is very candid. The film maker juxtaposes her life to Farah's. This is a bit much, given the only thing they seem to have in common is they are Iranian women. Farah's story is far more compelling and riveting than that of the film maker. Farah is an international celebrity. I also found the film maker's voice unattractive and wish she would have found another narrator. Her voice sounds as though she is whining."
1,Film maker a disgrace/ Subject matter of film outstanding...,"I rate this a 1 solely for the stupidity and amature execution of this film by the ""filmmaker"", but, a true 5 for the subject matter of the film. The only good thing about the making of this movie was for the viewers, to yet again, witness the grace and beauty of Queen Farah. I honestly cannot believe that she would grant this so called ""filmmaker"" the pleasure to be in her presence. I found her to be rude, dishonest, disloyal to IRAN and frankly came off very offensive with her LACK of class, LACK of proper attire in the presence of the Queen, and a true LACK of dignity and respect. She is one of those that assisted in making Iran what it has turned in to. She challenges the times of the Shah? What about now? To lie to the Queen about her past and have impure ulterior motives and to address the Queen as ""Farah"" after blatantly asking how the Queen would like to be or should be addressed was an utter disgrace and painful to watch."
3,Starts slow and gets better,"I have a passing interest in Iranian politics and enjoyed this film. However, as a documentary it leaves much to be desired. The film starts off really slow. The first several interview scenes simply show the queen and the interviewer sitting nervously with each other. I understand the point was to show them building trust, but it just took too long. The context, including a short recounting of the Shah's life and their marriage, comes a bit later, perhaps a bit too late for viewers with little familiarity with Iran. For most of the first hour or so, the film is kind of chatty and follows the Queen in her life in exile. There isn't much to show that she's anything but a rich socialite. Still, this documentary is a valuable look at the queen and has historical value. Overall, 3.5 stars."
2,Dull Cold War Story,"Not a ""Euro Spy"" movie and not a good vehicle for Sean Flynn. Little action, leaden direction, and a dull story line that goes almost nowhere. Try his other availble movie, Mission to Venice; a much more satisfying B movie."
1,This is a scam,"Autopartsway is a scam, they sent me a rectangle metal mesh that I can't do anything with. Doesn't look like the picture, won't fit my vehicle, wtf. I am not going to put up with this!!"
5,Teen Wolf,All of us love this show. I would consider it to be all different genres. I haven't missed an episode and I would recommend to anyone really.
4,Teen Wolf,Engaging teen show that actually ends a season without too much angst. Good plot twists make it interesting and hold your interest.
2,"Very, very light reading","This is a very simplistic ""picture-book"" about the dead. There are much more authoritative/informative books around about the history and sociology of the dead."
2,Nice Picture Book,This I will give two stars soley for the pictures which were decent. The book though was simple and uninformative.The latter year Dead Heads love to call this guy a scholar on the band.In my opinion the author was never more than a glorified groupie which is fine except when your selling yourself as a band insider with something to say that hasn't already been said a thousand times.Unless you want everything ever printed about the Dead this is probably one you could pass on.
2,Won't cut mule mane.,"I bought this to use in roaching my mule and the hair just bends in these scissors and won't cut. May work on a horse, don't know but sure won't cut my mule's hair."
2,Different shape,I ordered this product but what I ended up receiving were scissors with a different shape than the ones shown in the picture. I live out of the US and it is very difficult to return them. I guess I have to keep them.
5,Effective Sway Control,"Easy to assemble, install, and adjust for effective operation. will need to drill eight holes into side of tongue frame for bolt fasteners."
4,"Good overall, lacking by City Hunter standards",".357 Magnum is a very good movie, but those familiar with the other City Hunter movies will notice that this one's a bit lacking. The plot tends to drag very often, more than the Motion Picture, lacking the constant action and excitement that City Hunter usually provides. There's still some humor which is handled pretty well in the dub, and an awesome final raid scene. City Hunter: .357 is still worthy of a purchase, but it's not the best one."
2,The Flame in This Series is Dimming,"City Hunter fans and general anime fans of the world a few words of advice, DO NOT BUY THIS ANIME! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS ANIME, RENT IT IF YOU MUST BUT DON'T WASTE $25 ON THIS! If you must buy this title then at least get the dubbed version it is cheaper. This film has lame animation, a down right stupid story, the characters are annoying and the only desent action scene, the one thing that stops this from getting only one star, in the entire film is at the very ending. ADV Films is really desperate for money if they have decided to release this tape on the market. If you want true action then stick with any of the other City Hunter videos. Warning this film contains Violence, Language, brief Nudity and Mature Themes. Suggested age is 13 and up."
1,Misleading information on Amazon about this book,"I ordered this book because I was interested in the ""Land of Enchantment Run"". pg. 306 - 320. Amazon showed the Table of Contents from the 2nd Ed. instead of the 4th Ed. without mentioning that the New Mexico trip was entirely removed from the 4th Ed. Normally you expect to get more from a newer Edition and not less. When I returned the book they even charged me a $ 3.99,- fee. Obviously Amazon does not read these reviews because they are still showing the Table of Contents for the 2nd Ed. which a customer who would order the book won't get."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED :(,I bought this book after seeing in on a Bucks County site. It talked about a ride that went from New Hope to Lancaster and how scenic it was. After getting the book and looking up that ride I couldnt believe it actually said that there was a lot of beautiful roads going from New Hope to Lancaster but that he was giving directions via HIGHWAYS! I could have done THAT looking at a map! VERY DISAPPOINTED :(
5,Bull's Eye on All Issues,"I purchased an earlier version a few years ago. I liked it so much, that I recently bought a newer publication for my nephew. I found his information to be exactly what I was looking for and all of his recommendations of places to eat and places to stay dead on accurate. Even his comments on Taos, NM, where he says the mountain either calls to you or doesn't. It did not call to him and when my wife and I went there, we could not leave quick enough. It did not call to us either. I have been riding for 47 years and cannot say enough good about this book."
4,it was ok,this was ok but wished it had more than one ride per state there are alot more than what this book said. Its a good place to start tho.
5,Love it!,I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. We have enjoyed browsing thru the book searching for our next adventure. I love all of the maps and tips. Excellent book that we will keep and use forever.
4,"AN ""EASY RIDER'S"" GUIDEBOOK","Did you marvelled at Peter Fonda's ""Easy Rider"" film or even the old Marlon Brando classic, ""The Wild One""? Have you longed to feel the wind blowing around you as you steer your course through America's highways and by-ways on your motorcycle? Here's a guidebook complete with photographs to help you weave your way through that adventure. Complete with hotels, scenic routes documentation, and humorous commentary from the author. Read the book, then take a tip from country- western singer, Willie Nelson, and get ""On the Road Again!""{This review refers to an out-of-print edition.}"
3,Yuppie Yuck,"What a dud. When I read the section Mighty Montana Run and saw the distance of the leg 335 miles...alow five days with stops I knew this wasn't the book I hoped for. The author's style is entertaining and humorous, but his recomendations of places to stay and see is strictly for the bored rich. Most places were WAY above $120 a night. If your idea of a road trip is camping and out of the way places with an occasional night in a modest local hotel pass on this yuppie guide. If your trip is to an unfamiliar area of the country there are a few good tips that save this book from one or two star oblivion. I'm not a high milage junkie, but this book sputters along until you're glad it stops.{This review refers to an out-of-print edition.}"
4,good earphones,"I listen to my Zune on the bus and this does a decent job of noise cancelling. Way better than the earphones that came with my Zune. It comes with 3 different sized earbuds, so one of them will fit you snuggly."
5,Earphones that fit,Finally an earphone that fits and stays in place even when I'm running or lifting weights. My ears no longer hurt after removing them as others have done. These earphones are a great value as well.
4,Great deal for the price,"Hey all, in my opinion this is the best bang for the buck. You get what you'd want in higher end headphones in terms of comfort, style and sound isolation, but the biggest con of these earbuds is the quality of sound. I've been using my Sony MDR-EX71SL's for about a year and a half (went through 3 pair, they have cords which fray really quickly), and in comparison to the EarThumps, the Sony quality is much true to how the CD sounds on my shelf unit. The EarThumps ""attempt"" to produce a fuller effect, wherein you feel like you are immersed in the music, however, it only ends up making the bass overpower the treble, causing the trebel and vocals to sound muffled on many of the tracks I listen to.It will work, it will last, and it sounds okay, I think I got my $19 worth, rather than paying $45-50 for another set of my Sony's which I would have to replace in another 4 months."
4,good but need to replace,"I've had the same problem Angel Space mentions ~ after a while (2-3 months?) one side goes intermittently out, influenced by jiggling the cord near where it enters the iPod. But the price is right, they sound and feel better than the next alternative (RadioShack's similar version), and are much more comfortable than the iPod standard issue (ouch!), so I keep replacing them. I'll try to be more careful with the cord if the Griffin Co will work out this bug ;-)"
5,Nice all around!!,"I had to find some comfortable in-ear phones when i bought my ipod, because the stock ones apple sends just hurt too much. I tried many different brands, at many different prices. Jenses, phillips, sony, all of these were faily costly, and didn't have the greatest sound. I got these from a friends referral, and I still have them today. They are relatively more cost efficent than the bigger name brands, and better sound. I have tried multiple new sets as well, by listening to a song with one set, and then with my griffin set. So far, griffin has trumped the others. I reccomend to anyone."
3,just ok...,"like other reviewers, I find the ipod earbuds to be uncomfortable, like the sound but can't stand the feel. these Griffins are FAR more comfortable... but the sound quality isn't that great compared to the ipod earbuds. I've tried several brands of earphones in my search for something close to ipod earbud sound quality, but more comfotable... and the Griffin's are the best I've heard in this price range... and acceptable back up or replacement at $15. remember, you get what ya pay for..."
1,No Thump...,"Sorry to bummer out on Earthumps, there is simply no depth of sound from these earbuds. Judging from the great reviews, we purchased & wondered why we were able to score such a deal. The $8 purchase was definitely worth the little case, superior part of the package, our Sansa Clip tucks away nicely...with the ORIGINAL earbuds. Earthumps produce tinny sound, no bass whatsoever, perhaps for listening to AM talk radio, who knows, ours went directly into a drawer forever, emergency only. This has us pondering whether iPod & other listeners have no quality sound coming from their MP3 units. Sansa Clip & ORIGINAL earbuds are awesome. Best to hit the electronics store & try earbuds out in person. Earthumps? Thumpless...."
2,Muddy sound with no detail,"They were pretty cheap but even so they have really bad sound, muddy &distorted with no detail in mids or highs.Recommended cheaper Earphones under $20:Koss Spark Plugs (older silver/maroon ones) good bass, a little fuzzy highs.Logitec Xbox/Playstation earhones (work great on pc and are the best sounding for under $50)deep clear bass and crisp highs."
3,ok for its price,"When I bought these headphones I thought they would be pretty good for their price and when I got it I was somewhat disappointed. The earthumps aren't bad, they just aren't very good either. I used to have the sony fontopia earphones and they are much better, because they fit in my ear better and its much softer and I can wear it for much longer. However, sony is also more expensive so if you want cheap earphones you might want to buy the earthumps but if your music is very important to you and you listen to it a lot I would certainly recommend paying a little more and get the sony fontopia."
2,Usable but don't sound right,"It is great to listen to songs with lots of bass. Misses most of the treble sounds and if you listen to gentle carols, classicals and soft music with with instruments like chimes, this headphone will not do the job. I am just going to listen to audiobooks in slightly noisy places and this works fine for me. I could not give 3 stars to make this item get an average grade because with lots of songs I possess it's performance is not upto my satisfaction."
1,Comfortable but poor sound!,"The EarThumps are very comfortable headphones that stay in your ear, BUT the sound quality is very poor. I would characterize the sound as being Muffled. I have 2 different cheap, cheap earbuds that sound great compared to the EarThumps. I am no audiophile, but if you are looking for headphones that have crisp clear sound, stay away from these. I was extremely dissappointed!"
1,Use the iPod earbuds,I was expecting decent sound after reading the reviews. These sounded like it was being played out of a very old radio. The bass and the treble were too loud and the mid was noexistent. Don't buy these. Stay with the ones in the box.
4,Great headphones at a great price!!,These headphones are great for the price!! They are so much more comfortable than the ones that come with the ipod touch. I also like that they come in colors so you can match your ipod. I haven't had any problems with them and I love the carrying case. It's the perfect size to hold a cleaning cloth and video stand that came with my ipod touch. There might be better ones out there but for the price and how often I use them these are perfect!!
3,Just average,"I found these earbuds to be ""just average"" and I think the sound quality is slightly worse than the Apple Earbuds that came with my iPod nano. They are comfortable enough to wear, though I haven't tried wearing them for extended periods of time yet."
2,Is it me or the earphones?,"My ears must be different than most peoples. I do have pretty small ears, but not abnormally small, and these earphones most definitely do not work for me. Even the smallest size falls out. No idea what the deal is."
2,short life,"two stars for fast shipping, but the left channel crapped out after only a couple of weeks. should've lasted longer than that."
4,Best for the price,"These is an exceptionally good product for the price. The sound quality is excellent, and the in-ear fit and design of the earphones is quite comfortable. I would buy these again."
3,Spend a few bucks more and get better quality headphones,"I was really happy with these, until after a year or so the plastic began to peel and separate. I got what I payed for I guess...."
2,Sounds like I'm listening through a tin can,"I don't know what product these other reviews are referring to, but I just bought mine from here on their basis, and the sound on my ipod headphones was much richer, much wider, and these just sound terrible. They fit nicely and are comfy, but the sound is just tinny."
2,"Decent sound quality, terrible cable design","Other people have explained about the sound quality of the earphones in detail, so instead I'll focus on what I feel is the main drawback: the cables. I have never had earphone cables that tangle so easily. The cables feel somewhat elastic, which I think contributes to easy tangling and (as someone else mentioned) the retention of awkward shapes in the line. There are other, better options for earphones that provide both quality sound and better-material cabling. Sound quality is up from standard earbuds, but cable material and use is a decided step down (or several)."
3,Okay but I still ended up getting a Sony,"These earphones are okay but they're a little bulkier that the Sony's.The sound is not the best compared to Sony's but for half the price others may find these good enough.I didn't like how it fit in my ears. After a while, it became uncomfortable.I do like that it came with a case. I don't even use it anymore."
5,"Small Price, Big Sound","I had these earphones before which is why I purchased them again. Nice sound, good bass whichis what I am particular about in earphones. I purchased earphones that cost four times as these but theyare not nearly as good. I got beyond my money's worth . . . again."
3,"Not bad for earbuds, but there are much better headphones for this price","If you are looking for a cheap replacement for the worthless earbuds that your iPod came with, these are a significant upgrade, especially if you won't consider non-earbud headphones. The sound isolation is great, and sound quality is much, much better than the headphones that came with your iPod.But if you are looking for a great sounding pair of budget headphones, and you are willing to consider other types of headphones, there are better headphones out there, like the Koss KTXPRO Titanium over-the-ear headphones, which cost about $2 more than these, and will blow your mind.While much better than iPod headphones, the Griffins still suffer from earbud sound-quality blues. Bass can be muddy. Mids are not particularly defined, mid-highs tend to be shrill, and treble is tinny.If you absolutely will not consider anything but earbuds, these are good for the money, but if you are open to suggestions, get the Koss headphones."
3,Not as good as I thought.,"First of all, I ordered the White Griffin Ear Thumps and received Black ones. I kept them because my ipod has a black case. I was not impressed with the sound quality of the EarThumps. From the many reviews that I read, I was expecting better sound. Don't get me wrong, it's probably the best you'd get for twenty dollars but some of the reviews I read claimed excellent bass response which I do not feel comes close to the original ipod earbuds. The EarThumps do not hurt my ears like the ipod earbuds do after sitting in my ear for a while. I like the soft rubber covers. What I don't like is that they fall out quite easily. I've tried the different size inserts in my ear, sitting them different ways, but every way that I try to place them, they still fall out very easily. Any slight pull on the cord or any sudden turn of my head and out they fly."
2,Not as good as it use to be,This generation of griffin earphones just aren't as good as the earlier ones. I tossed them away and went back to older one that's shorting off
1,defective,"out of the box, they were defective, and at this proce not worth the cost and trouble of sending them back. probelm with wiring at the plug. could jiggle and make one speaker work."
4,A View into a Life and Time of Commitment,"Final Flight is an account of one family dealing with its time and place in an era of dedication to ones ideals. Many will see a common thread in their own lives if they lived through that time. This is a touching story of a family ""doing its best"" during a period of what some may identify as a period of political unrest in the country. We need more men like Ken to combat similar problems today."
4,A Toast to Life & Service in the Military,"As a military brat, I can well identify with this story of Air Force life. It's well written and realistic. No whining - just reflections of how things were. The chapters by the children were particularly enjoyable to me. If you are a military brat, you can well picture Ken as your father.I've loaned my copy to several people and it's always the same. Everyone who reads it is moved. Makes you want to see your parents and value your time with them."
1,"Not for the advanced Guitarist , standard chords unlike AH","I am a big fan of Allan's. I must say this book was a major letdown, as I expectd it to be centered around the chordal ideas he uses himself. Any guitarist who has a good grasp of theory and is a well educated guitarist will find this book remedial, other than whatever insight you may learn about how Allan views chords, which although interesting, will not do a whole lot for one's playing. I would reccommend ""Reaching For the Uncommon Chord"", even though a book of transcriptions, as a better book to get more ideas for guitar harmony than ""Melody Chords""."
3,Written by Allan Holdsworth's dad,"Just a note to anyone considering buying this so that they know what they are getting (or not getting):I don't actually own this book and I have never read it but I had read on Allan's official website (www.therealallanholdsworth.com) that his dad wrote this book and Allan wanted to convey that but the book publishers or someone wanted Allan's name on it, probably so it would sell better.My rating of 3 is based only on what I know."
3,OK but not enlightening,"Oil pastel is a very difficult medium to master and I bought this book looking for some kind of enlightenment that would help me become accomplished in the medium. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was rather disappointed.The book provides a wealth of examples of work of the artist intermingled with oil-pastel-evangelist preaching and information on techniques used. However even the step-by-steps didn't really help me to get from one step to the next and I was left kind of bewildered where I started.This is the only book on the market that deals exclusively with oil pastels. This is the reason I bought it and as such, it is probably worth buying. However don't expect enlightenment."
3,Good if you are already an artist,"If you are a painter or illustrator who is looking to move from another medium into oil pastels, then this is the book for you. Mr. Elliot is a really talented artist and knows his subject. You will gain a lot from this book.However, if you have little-to-no drawing/painting experience or you are an absolute beginner (like me), you will find yourself very, very frustrated by this book. I have found a few helpful things here, but overall, I think that I would need a year's study *before* I could effectively utilize Mr. Elliot's book."
1,"more of a gallery show, then a instructional book","this book is mostly a show and tell of comleted works and a short 1 paragragh description of what was used. basicly nothing more than an art show catalog, with a tiny bit of expermentation with mineral spirits in the back.if your just starting out, keep looking, this will not be helpfull, and is not worth the return postage to ship back."
4,Good Oil Pastel book,"I am a beginner for oil pastel but I do have expirence with other mediums. So the book is right for me.All three types of oil pastel brands John mentioned can be found in Jerry's. I actually brought Cray-Pas.Althrough John mentioned oil pastel techniques in his book, but there are more that he did not address. That is why I gave the book 4 start. I found out other techniques through search of internet. It would be nice to have all techniques in a book as quick reference.There are step by step illustration about how to use oil pastel in the book for still life, landscaping, and figure painting. Apparently, John's works suggest that he is accompalished figure painting artist. No so much for landscaping.So far, this book is the only book available that is devoted to oil pastel. The rest of the pastel books are all focus on soft pastel which techniques do not apply to oil pastel easily."
5,Oil Pastel for the Seriouse Beginner John Elliott,This is a wonderful book. Anyone would benefit from having this in his/herlibrary. I teach and I recommend it to my students.
4,Warmth & Exotica,"I have always loved Julie Christie, and have been cold towards Burt Reynolds. His white trash-stud-with-sense-of-humor has never appealed to me. But he has done a wonderful job of aging with dignity, at least on film. This latest DVD confirms that he makes a great character actor, who still exudes sex appeal. Christie...well, she is just as luminous as when she walked down the black and white English streets of Billy Liar. And her acting has reached a point that compares favorably with Meryl Streep, Katherine Hepburn, Vivien Leigh, and Garbo. She has aged with dignity, and honesty. I can't imagine Jane Fonda or Faye Dunaway showing their growth lines in close-up with such unconcern. A true Beauty never grows old, she matures and shines brighter."
3,Overall A Good Story,I enjoyed the movie. The plot could have used some improvement but the overall love story between Aisha's mom and Larry was touching. I also thought Aisha's journey of self-discovery was captured very well. The ending of the movie was the best!
2,Not so good,"Film doesn't make you care about the characters. Old hippy in Amsterdam? Spoiled, immature brat finding herself? Feh.Julie Christie was okay, but Burt Reynolds was indifferent and ""Carmen Chaplin"" was an absolute disgrace. A talentless person playing a shallow and silly character. Quite a combination. And if that's not enough, in spite of what the other characters in the movie say, Droopy ain't much to look at, either.Rent if you must and be thankful it's only 90 minutes."
5,Nice,"I have had this stapler for 2 and a half years, and it still works perfectly well.I do A LOT of stapling at work which makes a manual stapler a nightmare.It goes through several sheets of paper with no problem.It has only jammed when I used cheap staples. If I use Stanley staples, I have no problems at all."
5,Electric Stapler,Very good quality electric stapler. Staples through several pieces of paper with no problem. Good value & buy for around the office.
1,Died after 5 months of use,"I loved this little stapler, until it completely died without warning or symptom after 5 months of use. Of course the return window is closed. I'd steer clear of this one."
2,Looked good but failed in one day,"The stapler arrived yesterday, and we ran this stapler a couple of hundred times yesterday, stapling two sheets at once. This morning, it jammed right off the bat. There's one staple stuck where the blade is located. I couldn't plug it off, as it was really stuck, and the stapling action doesn't occur anymore. I'm very disappointed, and I don't recommend this product to anyone. It's being returned today."
3,it nice,"its smells fresh and nice, wanted to buy this to see what it was like before i buy a bigger one,i do like it but wish if the shiping faster ,"
1,Doesn't fit,This phone case is such a tight fit it is almost impossible to get it on the phone without stretching it out. I have returned it for a refund. Not worth anything. You can go to Best Buy and pick one up cheaper and quicker.
3,Functional but flawed as a gift,"The rolling pin is very functional and arrived in a very timely manner. It was a good value, but I also paid for quick delivery. I purchased it for my Mom as a Christmas gift. (Her sentimental one had broken) When it arrived, there were a few nicks in the edge of the marble. My Mom did not believe they would interfere with the function and was happy with the gift. As a gift giver, you want the gift to be free of flaws."
4,COMPACT & GREAT FOR HOLDING CHANGE,I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS 5 STAR BUT IT DOES NOT HAVE A SLOT FOR NICKELS. OTHER THAN THAT IT IS A GREAT COMPACT HOLDER FOR COINS.
4,Holds coins just fine,"Before I had this I just dumped loose change into the ash tray of my car. This is much more convenient and tidy. Works as advertised and have not had any problems. I wish it had an additional slot for pennies, but I just put them in with the nickels."
3,"Perfect, after some super glue!","Ok, a lot of super glue. First wait for the top and bottom to fall apart. Then super glue them back together. Then wait for the heat in the car to separate the Velcro from the coin holder. Super glue them back together. Next wait for he heat to separate the Velcro from the car. Super glue that Velcro piece back to the car. Finally, you have an awesome, fully-functional coin holder. Mine works great now!"
3,It works,Is not able to hold too much coinsBut serves its purposeIs good when you have lots of coins!
5,It is what it is,"I needed a coin holder for my car - the one that came in the car was not adequate. I would have preferred four slots so I could do quarter, nickels, dimes, and pennies, but I could not find one of those, and this was the next best thing. It is quite small and holds a lot of coins and meets my needs."
4,A good buy for the money,"I had a lot of loose change in my car which was quickly cleaned up with this change holder. As other reviews stated, the springs do not appear to be very strong, but the unit seems to work just fine...for the price, you can't beat it."
4,"Good bargain, holds just under $9 total","I have to admit, I was a bit surprised by how small it actually was when it arrived, but once I starting filling it with change, I realized just how much it really holds! Perfect for organizing all that loose change in your car or in your house. I thought it would be useful to let other viewers know how much of each coin type this compact unit actually holds:18 nickels ($0.90)21 quarters ($5.25)27 dimes ($2.70)GRAND TOTAL = $8.85This product will be VERY useful for me when driving through the Chicago tolls at Christmas time this year. I won't have to try and dig for the exact amount or worry about change spilling out of my cup holder if my center console collapses. Makes for a great stocking stuffer!"
4,OK,The coin holder is OK. It holds a lot of change but I am thinking that the spring used for the Quarter compartment should be stiffer. It sometimes does not advance the quarters like it should.
5,Works great in my Miata,"I was looking all over for this type of coin holder but could not find one in any of the local stores. Seems they only carry the round cup holder type. Those are pretty big for my purposes. I wanted one for my 1999 (NB) Miata. The shape of this one fits perfectly in the little spot under the arm rest, almost like it was made for it. Quality seems fine for my purposes. I wanted this for my meter change when parking downtown, I hate things rattling around and this fits the bill. I posted a few pics in this review to show where I located it. I just used the Velcro that came in the box."
4,"Works OK, but still recommend it","I own a '03 Dodge Ram, so there isn't a coin holder in my truck. I used to put coins in my ash tray, or in the center console armrest. However, when I lift the armrest, I can just hear the change go everywhere. So, I decided to pick this coin holder up. When you first get it, you may be surprised at how small it is, but it does hold a good bit of change in it. As others have already commented, it holds just under $9 of Quarters, Dimes, and Nickels.Some reviews say the springs are too weak, and some say they're strong. My point here is nobody is going to get the same springs. Some springs happen to be weak and some happen to be strong. Mine were a little on the weak side when trying to get out the change. But after the first couple of tries, my change is coming out pretty good now. Maybe the springs just needed worked in a little.If it doesn't hold enough change for you, you can always pick up 2, because the price isn't half bad."
5,Great little coin holder for the car,This is a great little coin holder for the car.It holds18 nickels ($0.90)21 quarters ($5.25)27 dimes ($2.70)GRAND TOTAL = $8.85To be clear it does not have a slot for pennies.It even comes with adhesive velcro pieces so that you can place the coin holder exactly where you want to keep it. Fits great in my civic. No more messy pile of change and no more scrapping through it to find the exact change I need.Might have to get another just to fit my incoming change.
2,Some (re)assemby required,"Be sure to follow the advice of other reviewers here: Use some super glue to secure the two pieces together or you're likely to have coins ""exploding"" everywhere the first time you try to load it. Pretty poorly constucted, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,It fell apart.,"4 months to the day after I ordered this product, it fell apart in my car, strewing coins all over the place. I may be able to SuperGlue it back together (I haven't yet tried), but it really shouldn't have been necessary. Before it fell apart, I liked using it to keep toll and parking money handy in my car."
5,About Time !,"I was thrilled to finally see that some of the great work of The Rhinestones has been released on CD. Give this disc (their first album) a listen and be ready for some tight playing and great vocals. Kal Davids guitar playing is fantastic. Now, how about releasing the other 2 albums on disc ?"
5,Fabulous Rhinestones,"Saw them many times at the Shaboo Inn in Storrs, Connecticut (nightclub of choice in the late 70's and early 80's for UConn students.) This band was the best thing there was before the Radiators from New Orleans (which you can still see in concert.)"
3,"Cute Feminist Reworking of Defoe's ""Moll Flanders""","After reading DeFoe's sensationalized drama of a poor hapless young girl being used and abused by men, this book about a swashbuckling lesbian petty thief by the same name is quite a relief--and a good chuckle!"
4,To be like Mrs. Pollifax is my goal in retirement!,"In the UNEXPECTED MRS. POLLIFAX, author Dorothy Gilman continues to amaze and amuse with the antics of an older woman who refuses to fit the mold. I have read all the ""Mrs. Pollifax"" books -- and look forward EAGERLY to the next. Keep up the good work, Mrs. Pollifax!"
1,The book arrived in disrepair.,The book arrived with many pages squashed into a folded back bundle. I was very disapointed. The book was not carefully packaged. It probably was fine before mailing. It is hard for me to describe the condition. I have put it under a very large dictionary hoping to smooth out the pages.
3,"Cute, fun","This book is cute and well written. However, be aware, it was written in the 1950's i believe and it is not to the standards of political correctness that we have now..which is on some level refreshing, but can get a little irritating at times. That said, characters are good, story moves fast and worth spending a few hours to read."
4,Unusual Premise,"A wonderful and origional story of espionage carried out by an older woman who is feeling bored and useless.This delightful older heroine and wanna-be spy really captured my attention. Not only is the story interesting and well-done, but I love the statement the author makes by using an older woman. It sort of made me less afraid of getting old to see an example of how one really can continue to live to the fullest, as long as one is willing to still take a few risks. Although I normally prefer characters near my own age, this novel I think has appeal for any age, and besides, I always sort of wanted to be a spy too."
2,Futuristic,I was not drawn into this story as much as I have been for all of W. Michael Gear's other books. It does not keep my interest and I keep putting it down and losing it.Usually I finish one of his books in one day.Perhaps I just like looking into the past rather than a future
5,"Great Band, Great CD","This would be a welcome addition to many music fans' collections. It seems to span several different categories, including jazz and easy-listening rock without ever being confined to one. A sorely-needed, positive message is the only common thread.The music encompasses many different styles, yet it has a top-notch ""feel"" in all areas. The band honors Bill's music and lyrics well, the production is perfect, and Bill tops it off with soulful, heartfelt vocals. It's all good.I'm looking forward to future releases."
5,Wonderful CD,"I found out about this CD through my boyfriend who was a student of one of the band members. I heard the CD with him for the first time and it was just great! All the songs have a unique style and the musicianship from all the band members is wonderful. I hope they come out with a new one soon, because I can't wait to hear it! Why don't you guys come to Ithaca to do a concert? :)"
3,"great product, poor packaging",This is what was used on me in my salon but it arrived opened/not sealed which is why I gave it 3 stars.
2,NOT Moisturizing,"This conditioner leaves your hair feeling more like it was conditioned with a volumizing condition, read: dryer and hard to get a brush through. I can barely rip a brush through my hair after using this for a week. It DOES smell incredibly good, but my hair is so left frizzy with the ends undone (I have fine, straight hair) that the smell just isn't worth it. :("
3,"Conditioner good, pump bad","I received the tea tree conditioner today, smells nice, worked great. I gave 3 stars instead of 5 because of the pump dispenser being broken- it will be very difficult to use this huge liter bottle without a pump."
1,Not bad but could have been much better,This series isn't really my cup of tea it was cute and funny but the concept was a bit strange.A man poses as a woman to get a job at an all girls school if it sounds cool check it out if not Id stay away theres not much here for people who aren't fans of crossdressing.
5,"Great vendor, good price, As advertised","Exact fit for my Dell Laptop, Installed in minutes, works perfect. Price and shipping good."
4,"Arrived as a broken part, but replaced very fast","Whether it was prior or during shipment, one of letter keys was broken. The customer service was excellent. They sent me replacement in no time and installation was easy following the instruction on website."
5,Fantastic!,"These are great potholders!After searching far and wide for good potholders (seems like a silly thing; until you need them!) I finally wondered, 'Whatever happened to good old-fashioned potholders?' I searched the internet and found these. What a GREAT find! After using them for 3 months, I'm ordering two more! They are easy to work with, my hands have never been burned when using them and they wash beautifully. No slippery silicone; no big, bulky awkwardness; no pockets, etc.... just plain old functionality! Love it!"
3,Should You Buy It? Depends on Who You Are,"When I first bought Tahnok-Va, I immediately realized how quick and easy the set was to build. In all honesty, it's not a very complicated Bionicle set. Technically speaking, you could call this set the Ta-Matoran of the ""Bohrok World"".One thing I found interestng was Tahnok-Va's ability to actually SIT DOWN: something that wasn't really popular with early Bionicle figures. The set also has three Kranas that can be used on your actual Bohrok/Bohrok-Kal. These Kranas can be launched from a backpack-like device on the set's back. To use this device, simply place a Krana on it, flick the Bohrok-Va's right arm forward, and watch the Krana fly.To finish this review, I would recommend LEGO Bionicle 8554 Tahnok-Va only to hard-core bionicle fans/collectors and NOT for people with little or no knowledge about Bionicle."
5,AMAZING BOOK ! Great Read!,"This is another great creation written by Jewelene Banks! I describe her writing and creativity as; Blessed ,Action, Adventure, Creative, Intelligent, Exciting. I wish each everyone could read Zeola and every teacher/educator can use Jewlene's Book Boy's Pull Your Pant's Up in History class or in tutoring as I do daily. I Enjoy all of Mrs. Banks Plays and Books! If I was Rich Or When I become Rich I will invest in Mrs. Banks Work to share with Others!"
4,Very well done game!,"I have played the game for about 5 hours now. When it first started I was really impressed with the quality and detail of graphics. Usualy strategy games have average graphics at best, this game has very detailed ingame objects.The strategy part itself is also very good although I must say it's not anything completely new. The weapons you control and commands you can issue are standard which is fine with me, I guess that's just how new strategy games are. And the voice system is interesting, it lets you say your commands instead of typing or clicking, nice."
2,Basic and rather boring,"I'm sorry to admit this, but I really wasn't impressed with this book at all. First and foremost, it is extremely dry and boring to read. I didn't find any part of it interesting on either an intellectual or spiritual level. Secondly, the author lists 50 reasons why Christ sacrificed himself for our sins, but that's all it really is -- a list. Each chapter is about a page and a half long, or at best two pages. The author doesn't go into any great detail, just cites some related Bible verses and offers some basic commentary. Finally, I never did get a sense of the author's tone. I have read some Christian books that are emotionally saccharine and focus on only the ""loving"" part of God, and others that are quite the opposite and take a ""tough love"" approach, but this one seemed to lack any tone at all. In short, there are far better Christian apologetics books out there.... I'm sorry I cannot list this as one of them."
5,WOW!,This book is wonderful. Piper delivers a timely and PASSIONATE (no pun intended) exposition of 50 reasons WHY the passion happened. Each reason is covered by a two page explanation and some of the explanations may suprise you!!I highly recommend this book!
5,Very Nice!!,"This is a great book! Piper did a nice job on this book. He writes with great PASSION (no pun intended) and lists 50 things that Christ's death on the cross accomplishes. Each explanation is short and to the point. I found it to be a light, enjoyable read and would recommend it to anyone."
2,dissapointed...,I always hate doing this to my own brethren but this overview isn't very good. I could only read half an hour of this.
5,a good summary of Christianity,"Piper has distilled the essential content of Christianity into 50 two-page essays, each supported rigorously with relevant scriptures and sound exposition. While Piper does not elaborate on the meaning of the resurrection (for this, see the works of Dr. Gary Habermas), his treatment of the suffering and death of Christ is what you might expect from a semester-long seminary class. Yet, the writing is easy to understand and does not require any previous knowledge of the faith, except perhaps the basic story outlined in the gospels. This book is required reading for anyone who wants to know why Jesus came to die."
5,LOOK TOWARDS THE CROSS AND BE SAVED,"""Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him;he has put him to grief."" Isaiah 53:10At this time of year, we Christians normally recall to our hearts and minds the life of our Lord Jesus Christ, as he was about to leave the world in the flesh, and be crucified by Roman soldiers.With sadness we look towards the cross and the more we look we wonder why God had to chose this way of crucifying His Beloved son, and if there could not have been an easier and less painful way to pay for the sins of the world. We trust Our Heavenly Father, and we trust the choice He made to prove His love for us. In the Passion of Jesus Christ, John Piper spells out the fifty reasons why Christ suffered and died. Read this book for a better understanding and be blessed through it.Heather Marshall Negahdar(SUGAR-CANE 07/03/05)"
5,essential for the new believer,Piper is one of the giants in contemporary Christian theology. In this book his gives us fifty reasons that Christ came and died on the cross for us. He uses scripture as his basis of truth. For the seeker or new believer this is an absolutely a must read.
5,"Good for those still ""Searching""","Having just finished this book, I quite enjoyed it, though I believe it is most suited to those who have yet to find the Lord and are intellectually curious. I say ""intellectually"" because this book is not one to be read lightly or breezed through in quick little jaunts. Mr. Piper gives 50 different reasons why Jesus was crucified (""why"" as in the ""purpose"" and ""meaning"" of His death). Each reason is short and well explained and supported by many references from the Bible. But sometimes the logic is difficult, especially for those not already steeped into the life and death of our Savior. However, it is great for newer Christians to help them more clearly see the glory of the Lord and would also be suitable for the more intellectually-minded deep-thinkers who have yet to give their lives to God."
4,"Great devotional book; solid, thorough, and enjoyable.","This one would probably best be read as a devotional book. The book is made up of 50 2-page devotionals, each with a focus on the death (passion) of Jesus Christ. For the most part, there's not a lot of overlap between the devotionals, and Piper does a really nice job of clearly explaining each concept, providing plenty of Scripture, and being concise and focused.Near the end, there are some really great and unexpected reasons for Christ's death, including modeling marriage and reconciling races. These aren't your average fare, and are well-defended and articulated.Piper also does a great job of being theologically neutral in terms of Calvinism, which some people get upset about. His theology is there, but it's not at all in your face or over the top, in terms of less-foundational doctrines. Of course, his coverage of the cross is very in-your-face, as it should be, and very well done."
5,God,"FLCL is the god, poetry, and life of animes. Not to mention, the DVDs look beautiful. Backdrops and animation are beautifully done. A must have.FLCL is a life changing production"
3,Not as large as the picture makes it seem,These look larger in the picture and that is because nothing else in the picture is there to put it in scale. Still a good inexepensive gift for a nephew learning to play chess.
5,Just like the old Citizen Noblia watch,"I brought this for my wife to replace a 20 years old Noblia watch that she lost.This watch, at 1/10th the price, looks and feels just like the original.I believe the dimensions are identical. It is very compact - about 1"" indiameter, 1/8"" thick and extremely light. The crystal is plain old glass(the Noblia's was sapphire, scratchless after 20yrs). Band is pretty long,but fits fine on my wife's small wrist. My only negative is on the packaging.The box ""tried"" to look expensive, but came short; the instruction ""sheet""did not even try. Consider repackaging when buying it as a gift.Not sure about durability - the old one needed only 2 battery changes,and endured washer/dryer cycles and several lost and found incidents.But for the price and general fits and finishes, it's worth a 5 stars."
3,Mistakes indeed,"The reviewer from Japan was right in noting mistakes. This book is riddled with them, especially typos, skewed facts and sometimes real gaffes. (But begging your indulgence, fellow reviwer, eggplants are not from the Americas.)"
2,Betty takes Jennifer for a ride,"Jennifer Connelly must be desperate for work, becuase it's been ages since I've seen her in anyhting that showed off her considerable talents. This one is probably the worst. It's a ridiculous caper movie trying to masquerade as a serious film. It's starts out fairly decently with the Banderas character, then puts Connelly's in clear focus as the central character. Once it gets to the scene where they are investigating the cave as two professionals, then start doing it on the very uncomfortable cave floor, you know it's a stupid film, and it just goes downhill from there. It turns into maudlin sentimentality after that, with very overplayed scenes of him helping her after being shot down in the street. It wasn't the acting that was bad, though, it was everything else. I was hoping Banderas would just take her on his motorcycle and get Jennifer out of there, because they both deserve a writer/director better than Betty Kaplan."
5,"IF YOU LOVE ANTONIO, YOU'LL LOVE THIS MOVIE","I FOUND THIS TO BE A VERY INTERESTING MOVIE WITH ONE OF THE TENDEREST LOVE SCENES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. IT MAY BE A LITTLE ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES IN CERTAIN PARTS, BUT OVERALL I LOVE THIS MOVIE, AND WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN."
4,I think it was a pretty good movie,I think this movie was very good movie and romantic.You will have to see this movie to truly understand it.I think Jennifer connelly and Antonio Banderas do a great job on this movie.
2,Even Connelly can't help this one..,"This movie just sucked. I rented it from BlockBuster because I love Jennifer Connelly and they gave it a good rating, but it was horrible! There were maybe 2 semi-interesting parts in the entire movie, and they only lasted about 6 minutes each. It seemed to rip off a bunch of movies that were made before, and I was almost falling asleep at some parts. If you are a hardcore Connelly fan, I would just recommend renting this one, because you probably won't want to watch it again. And she really doesn't reveal *anything* anyway."
1,It [disappoints],"This movie is so bad you are just going to laugh.The acting is terrible, the settings are awful.And of course you have Allende boring, cheesy and easy Writing. Obviosuly she depicts people in the chilean right as the ""evil"" ones, and the ones on the left as the ""good"" ones. Sorry but history is more complicated. The plot is an absurd left wing account of Chilean recent history. The movie also reaffirms that Allende is a terrible writer. ...Please don't see this movie. It is so bad."
1,more garbage from the razzie magnet,youd think after ruining so many movies that producers would stop using her.boggles the mind j lo has so many chances to screw up movies.the best part is her movies dont see more than 2 weekends and quickly fade away.....now if only she would
3,A serious subject in a superficial movie,"Chile and Argentina have gone through tragic years during the 70's, and this movie attempted to tackle what happened - everyday at the time, in Chile. Two good actors (Banderas and Connelly) seem lost in a poor script and directorship, although Allende knew the subject from the inside (I did not read her book yet).Banderas could not concentrate and acted quite bad, and you can see that the way his eyes wander in several scenes with Jennifer. She makes a big effort in her role, but this is not one of her good movies.In Jennifer's attempt to bring the South American political disaster to the screen, a much better (remarkable) film is Waking the Dead. A must see!Note: their love scene in Of Love and Shadows could produce a tender moment in this play, but was grossly produced and the director missed the chance, unfortunately."
5,One scene makes the movie!,"Let's face it: overall this movie [isn't very good!]There is however one good scene, that makes up for the wasted time spent watching this.This involves the two leads investigating an serious assignment in a cave, while all of a sudden they start doing it on rock hard concrete(!)That scene alone gives this movie all 5 stars in my humble opinion!"
4,Of Love and Shadows,Watching this movie made me realized I have seen the movie in past years. Movie came on time and in great condition. If you like Jennifer O' Connelly or Antonio B. get this movie. I'm glad I did after watching the movie again.
4,Of Love and Shadows,"I bought this movie because I am a fan of Antonio Banderas, But I was disappointed in the story, and found it to rather boring."
1,Slithery,"We bought four of the 649-350 injectors through Amazon.com as a replacement to accompany an engine rebuild. Alright, we will admit- we got bit by the snake for $126.28 for the set. We will not be able to use any of them. A couple have physical damage (you would not be able to make an electrical connection due to the plastic being melted/deformed)- one had greasy black debris inside the discharge end, and a fourth one has a cracked nylon retainer for the o-ring.It is another one of the companies that needs to be labled as, ""buyer beware.""So, a big fat 0 is our rating for Tom."
2,Unjammable? Yea right,"Had this stapler for 4 months till it stopped working well. The internal mechanism is very flimsy for a heavy duty stapler. i've only been using it up to 5 times a day before it started to jam up on me, tear my papers, and punching holes in documents. DON'T BUY! Go for Swingline, it's 3 times cheaper, has a life time warranty and probably works better."
1,Ungainly paperweight,"Purchased this 6 months ago. I managed to get it to staple a few 50 page documents and the staples were gnarly. After that it just stopped working. Did not come with a manual and is impossible to figure out on your own. I bought Bostich because I wanted a quality name brand, Will possibly change review if I eventually get help from Bostich."
3,Critical design flaws; revised,"The stapler does bind large stacks if you can make it work.There is no spring to push staples forward, and (surprise!)they do not move by themselves. So you have to push them forwardevery time you want to use the stapler, and that's not easy.All that until it jams, and once there, that's it. It is notdesigned to be opened, so it sits idle, complete with""lifetime warranty."" A total waste.Update, Oct. 12, 2012. I've now had the stapler for 2 years.What I wrote then is still true; however you can fight theproblem to some extent by banging the stapler on the desk hard:bang the front end if you want the batch of staples in, the rearend if you want them out (for instance, to replace them withlarger-size staples). It's not very convenient, but you can getused to it. Otherwise, it works all right, so far the staples jammedonly once. Got them out using a small hook fashioned of a paperclip."
3,No use of the Stand,The archos case is of very good built quality ....you can be sure that your archos would be safe when it is inside this case as this case is very sturdy designed...the negative for this case is that the stand is not very effective and it keeps the archos at a viewing angle of 80 degrees which is not at all comfortable for viewing.
4,works for me,"My archos 504 already fell out of the case twice, both times because the case does not clip in and hold the device. The case looks slick but the fact that the device is not secure while in it and when not buttoned, is a problem."
1,stand case,"wow, how i can write a review about the item i have not received so far. i ordered this case on march 7th and to day is april 10th and it seems out of stock so far.well, i,m still waiting........."
4,"Nice design and works well, but expensive","This item looks great and cooks great. With fixed grill plates it isn't the easiest to clean and it is quite expensive when you realize that it has no fancy controls, timers, indicator lights, etc. You can probably get the same functionality for a lot less money if you don't care about industrial design."
1,"i threw it in the garbage, not even worth 1 star.",ridiculous book.i do NOT recommend wasting your money or time on this.i literally threw it in the garbage after i read it.such a waste of my money and time!
5,One Great Chair,"I purchased 2 of these last year. There are lots of wooden chairs and other furniture out there but few made with a wood anyone can pronounce. Since I am a woodworker and live in Oregon, I knew ahead of time I would treat this chair so it will retain its color and last in the rain. Any type of clear wood deck sealer will do and the TRICK to having a lasting chair is to place a small amount of ""liquid nails"" in each joint before screwing it all together (this chair does require assembly but it is EZ). If you seal the wood and secure the joints, this chair should last many years. I still love mine and they look great and because of the liquid nails...there are no creaks or movement whatsoever so I don't have to worry when my ""larger"" friends sit in them ;-)...buy them now...they are well worth it!!!"
1,What's It Made Of,"We need a little more information. The chair LOOKS great! But what kind of material is it constructed from? How big is it? A side view would be helpful also to see how the back curves. The price is good, now if I just knew a little more..."
1,Don't buy,It broke after the second time using it. The kids enjoyed it while it worked. They didn't drop it and we kept it in a deck box while not in use. Went to use it a third time and it won't come on at all.
5,Handy clock/alarm clock,This clock was great in Europe. It alarmed well and kept perfect time. It is small enough to easily pack but big enough to see the time. The lighted face was great when viewed at night. I will buy another as a gift!. This is perfect for my bedside clock!
1,Useless clock,"I purchased this clock for my teenage son to help me get him up for school at home. The clock GAINS 30 seconds per minute. The poor kid was awakened in the dead of night. (Yes, he got up and dressed) It cannot be adjusted to the correct pace and is therefore useless. After reading the other reviews, I'm apparently not the only customer this happened to. DON'T BUY THIS CLOCK. It can't even keep time."
1,Failed after several months,"This clock is compact and easy to use, perfect for travel. However, after several months, the alarm would go off in the middle of the night when I had set it for 6 am. The first couple of times it did this, I thought I had set it incorrectly. Then I noticed that the clock time would change, without input from the operator, from 1 to 4 hours (erratically)."
2,Travel alarm,"This item is nice and compact. Great for travel. (That is why it received 3 stars, only for portability).However, sometimes this clock will alarm and sometimes it will not. Dependability is not one of its stronger traits. I set my phone and also receive a hotel wake up call when I use this. I probably would have sent it back but when I received it I went overseas(for my job) and the time frame for returns was not available."
4,A Travel Alarm Clock for Regular People,"A little expensive, but its very straight forward. For example ""Alarm:On - Off"". You don't have to be a psychic to understand the controls. Very refreshing."
3,Be usable easy,Be usable easy and the price suits the reason but the light is not satisfy for me. And it not have function to show month-date.
3,Its portable and does the job!...,"Okay, I really had my doubts about ordering this portable clock. But, it does a good job for what it was intended to do. I did read the one star reviews and I cant say that I agree at all with them.I gave it three stars which I think is not too bad a rating for this little clock. The only reason for the three stars is simply that the ALARM is really not loud enough. But luckily I could hear it when it did go off. And it is rather cheaply made, but if this clock can withstand the test of time, then it most surely be worth the money. Only time will tell.But again, I'm glad I bought it, and it does the job for me. And yes, I'd recommend this as a good cheap clock.Oh, and another thing which I almost forgot.....when you want to see the hour in a dark room, its pretty hard to see the numbers."
5,A Jefferson book for all Americans,"This is a book that all Americans should read now, and re-read over one's lifetime. The editor has done an incredible job of distilling from over 20,000 of Jefferson's letters his elevating, illumining and inspiring thoughts. It is an insight into the man, the times and the country he so deeply loved and so tirelessly worked to create, nurture, expand and sustain. So many times I found myself exclaiming a ""Wow!"" over a quote, sometimes smiling, sometimes tearing-up, wistfully, at the depth of his soulful wisdom. Do not hesitate to bring this gem into your home, your library, and your heart."
5,A must have refrence guide for every THINKING American,"After reading James Bovards ""The Bush Betrayal"" and then reading this excellent collection of letters and thoughts from Thomas Jefferson it is inescapable to not see the warnings of as well as the fears of the founding fathers of this nation were very real and foreseen, and that they did their best to set in place as many safe guards as they could in the world they lived in, to try and protect as well as warn the future generations of this nation that we must never turn a blind eye toward those in government.This work is very well thought out and arranged to bring to a clear focus each area of thought that Jefferson reflected upon during his life both in and out of the political arena."
4,So another idiot wants to be a hero!,"More of a Saturday Matinee than a Fantasy Epic, but don't let that fool you. This is one of the best comedy series to come out in a while. The story of a sorcerer who'd rather be a swordsman and joins a group of female adventurers on their missions for fame and fortune. Riui is a bit of an idiot, but like so many idiots before him he becomes the glue that ties people together with his simple faith and honesty. And there's a prophesy in there somewhere too. Can't wait for more of this to come to video!"
2,"Not again, please ...","Its the same old, tired 'guy with several angry, man hating girls who makes them love him in time while getting beat to crap' story. This time anime does it with less flair in technical film and writing then most all other series. I suppose this is good for people who haven't seen a lot of anime, because it really is just another time around the same old block for me. I am sure for the under 18 boys, this series is like a Whitman sampler of sexual fantasy ... yeah."
5,filter,this seems to work a lot better than the cardboard thin filters. it takes awhile to complete what used to be a simple filter swap.
5,Great Value and Quality,OEM product at less than half the cost. Source shipped this item VERY fast. Good instructions very easy to install.
5,Breathe easy,It is amazing the stuff that comes out of the air in your house. I recommend these filters for every household.
5,18 months between filter changes!,"The Aprilaire 5000 does an excellent job removing dust and trapping fine soil of all types. The economical fan filters are fairly easy to replace, as the directions are on each box holding the fan filter. Because we are a non smoking household, we only need replace them every 18 months. Smoking house holds need to replace this filter yearly. The only suggestion I would have is to include a sticker that one would write the replacement date on. (I do this myself, each time)"
3,Crooked lines!,The quality of the paper of the perspective charts are not good enough to be used for several time and the converged lines printed on them are not truly straight!
3,why not sent rolled?,Folded prints are a problem but it was the only way to get these prints. I have had a set for many years which are now beyond use so the fold prints were better than nothing. They sould be sent in a roll to be really useful.
4,Delightful!,"There are lots of up-to-date songs that can now add themselves to the list of classical Americana pop - and Vic Damone knows how to deliver them well: ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"", ""Little Green Apples"", ""MacArthur Park"" gets that Damone polish and still carries that folksy sound associated with these popular tunes.""We Have All the Time in the World"" particularly got my romantic attention. Bravo Vic....you do it everytime!"
5,Look of Love (Import),"A sensational live performance by Vic Damone, the best singer of his kind. His renditions of MacArthur Park, Didin't We, La Vita, For Once In My Life,Can't Take My Eyes Off You are better than the originals. My favourite is Don't Let Me Go, a great dramatic ballad that should have been a huge hit. The arrangements and orchestra are superb and fully complement Vic Damone's voice.A real classic of its kind. The best."
5,Thoroughly entertaining family biography,"This exhaustively researched and really gripping book tells the story of Sulzberger/Ochs family and their relationship to the New York Times. As the family behind the Times, they were players on the stage of American history for most of the twentieth century. The family itself and the characters in it are fascinating-- the subjects range from Iphegene Ochs frustration that she as a woman would never be considered the heir to the throne, to the way that Adolph Ochs wheeled and dealed his way into building the NYT, to the hard family choices behind the publication of the Pentagon papers, to modern attempts from within the company to break the family power. It's a wonderful glimpse at one of the most powerful families of our time. It's worth noting that this book is not a business case history and that the reader will not find an explicit overview of any of the strategies that made the Times what it is."
4,A thorough and revealing portrait of a eminent family,"Tifft and Jones have written a well researched and interesting piece on one of America's most powerful, yet low-key, families, the Sulzbergers. The book is very objective, presents much of the family's quotations and answers without unecessary comment, and is historically significant. Although the family cooperated, Tifft and Jones do not have an awe or devotion to any particular slant or image. The power of the Times rests in its historical and present ethics and standards, and the guidance of a family that continues to regard it very much as sacred. A highly recommended book for anyone wishing to learn about this remarkable family!"
4,A VERY GOOD BOOK ON THE FIRST FAMILY OF NEWSPAPERS!,"""The Trust,"" is a very well written account of the family that has operated The New York Times for over 100 years. The book is as much about the family as it is about the newspaper. The only shortcomming is sometimes periods of time (i.e. World War II) are too condensed. But overall a fascinating read on a interesting topic!"
2,curiously uninformative and flacid,"Other than some family lore, there isn't much new in this book to anyone familar with the history and culture of the New York Times, and what's new isn't especially interesting. It values density over insight. It's remarkably devoid of journalistic analysis. It is weak on business analysis. As biography, it's a snooze. As journalism, it's a thumb-sucker, like one of those overwrought stories they run on the day after Labor Day, when there's nothing better in the hopper and lots of space to fill. I could put it down, and did."
1,Shame on Alex Jones and Susan Tifft,"The only positive comment one can make about this sorely disappointing excavation of the Sulzbergers and their newspaper is that it's written in fluid, clear prose. That's it! This is quite surprising given the credentials of these two supposedly fine journalists; they did a wonderful job excavating another newspaper dynasty -- the Binghams. But this time, little insight is offered; instead, the reader is loaded down with gratuitious gossip. Historic and psychological contexts are shabbily rendered. One can't help but wonder if Mr. Jones, who comes from a newspaper dynasty himself, albeit of a much smaller scale, was not dealing -- negatively dealing -- with his own issues in this book. The Sulzbergers, particularly, Arthur jr, a brilliant, progressive, and humane publisher, and deserve better."
1,The Establishment Press Protects its Biggest Member,"""The Trust"" tells a story most literate Americans almost know by heart. There is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- new here. Yet the reviews have all been misleadingly complimentary so that the myth of the smug, somewhat stupid NYTimes can go on. It is being beat badly these days by any news service on line. Reading the front page of the Times these days is like reading a monthly magazine ten years ago. The paper uncovers nothing new and the stories, offering value added interpretation, are boring.The book does bring to light one aspect: Arthur, Jr., current publisher and pooh bah, is incredibly and dangerously dumb. Looks to the charlatan business expert to give him what he so sorely lacks in brains, experience, and a legitimate education."
1,"One of the first white wolf mage books, and unfortunately weakest too.","Title tells it all, i am sure that steele dosent write anymore to white wolf. I only keep this book that my mage collection is near perfect."
1,Just wasting money!,"We have a Swingline stapler in office that I think is more than 10 years old and is completely made of metal. The quality of built is perfect, never jams without absolutely any problem. I needed a heavy duty stapler for myself and when I saw a 5 star review for this trash, I bought it.To staple 6 spots I used more than twice staples, because half of them didn't go through well and while I tried to bring them out (useing screw driver and pliers), I injured 3 of my fingers very badly. Right away I returned it back and amazon made me to pay $7.99 for shipping back. Next time I won't buy directly from amazon.About the built quality; Only the staple compartment has been made of steel, otherwise every other places is plastic. I really wonder how long it can work before breaking. Don't waste your money on this. It's Chinese and just has the name of Swingline!"
4,Good Stapler,"If you think you can buy a high capacity stapler without ever experience it jamming, you are really kidding yourself. When I first bought this stapler, yes, it did jam a few times. But you just have to LEARN how to use it. If you press to fast or too soft it can jam. But once you learn the technique, it will NEVER jam. I've stapled about 6 or 7 200 sheet ebooks, and it jammed only two or three times and these jams occurred when I first started to use it. Overall, a good stapler, and if you don't like it, just simply return it, try another stapler, or send it to the manufacturer if you believe it is defective (it has lifetime warranty)."
3,Good but...,"I was so tired of scrubbing nasty litter boxes for my six ferrets and I was hoping this product was the answer. Sadly it wasn't the solution for me. Was hoping I could just throw out the boxes and replace them when they got ""bad"", but these boxes are too expensive for that. Also, my ferrets shreaded the boxes (which made them leak) and since they were paper, it was hard to secure them in the cage and my ferrets moved them all over the place (they have a large cage).Every ferret is different and perhaps yours will not shread these. If you are using them as corner boxes in your house (not the cage) they may work for you.If the price on these dropped to the point that I could toss them on a daily or every other day bases it would have probably worked. Oh well... back to scrubbing litter boxes.... (big sigh)"
1,Not Impressed!,"This was the first time I've ever had a bad purchase with Amazon. I was looking specifically for an inexpensive black clock. I received it with several other items I had ordered, and the shipping material was so minimal that the clock face had been scratched by the other items. Back it went, in exchange for another clock. The second arrived in acceptable shape . . . then I noticed the next day that the time was off about 20 minutes or so. When I attempted to correct the time, the minute hand began swinging freely and wouldn't stay in one position! Back it went, with a refund request this time. Aside from Amazon's poor packaging, they were super in promptly acknowledging the exchange and the refund. It is Chaney Instruments that I might be a bit wary of, at least with this specific clock!"
1,sub rosa studios,"to be honest i'm not even going to waste my time to say how bad this film is, its just plain bad. somethin about a killer named one shoe magroo or somethin. anyways about a group of people who pretty much just sit around and do nothin until their killed one by one. movie is just utterly boring and doesn't go nowhere fast. its from sub rosa studios if that tells ya most of it. terrible film and i do mean terrible low budget movie. you've been warned."
5,Simply Amazing!,"I'm speechless, this book is amazing! From one surprise to the next, I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a definate good-read! Contrary to most other books, this one kept me up late in the night with only a lamp behind me and my Chihuahua in my lap. I love it, you will too!"
1,Warning: EXCEPTIONALLY BAD!,"I'm an intermediate-advanced salsa dancer, though people at salsa clubs often flatter me with the question ""Are you an instructor?"" I've taken individual and group classes in Santiago, New York and D.C. I have also seen a few salsa videos. This video is by far the worst dance instruction video (ANY dance) I've ever seen. How did they get this on the market in the first place??A friend bought it for me for Christmas. I showed him the video and he responded ""Oh my god! Dude, I'm so sorry, but the reviews said it was good!""Save your money! I can't imagine any other salsa video being worse. I won't even waste my time criticizing the specifics. My personal favorite: Razz M'Tazz from NY with on-2 instruction by a professional Puetro Rican Salsa group."
1,Salsa Video,"The video does show salsa moves from South and Central America to give you an idea on some of the moves they do there. However, after watching the video I am sure glad I don't dance that badly. The dancers on this tape have no ""sabor"". I would not recommend this video."
3,atoms,"If I could have seen more pages from the book, I would not have purchased it. I would have liked more information in the form of diagrams and charts. The actual lay out of the book is like a typed college report, rather than a published book. I was hoping to use it in my 4th grade classroom, but ended up not using it at all."
5,science experiments for kids,An outstanding collection of simple experiments for children of all ages. Can be used from elementary school on up using simple materials available at home to illustrate chemistry basics.
1,DONT BUY,The camera has a low wireless range and it is not recomended for beginners as the configuration is not easy.If you are lokking for an IP Camera dont buy this one.
4,Superb - to short - left me wanting more!!!,"I read this book in one day...its pretty short but very well written. The story flows and as I neared the end I began to get that dreadful ""to be continued..."" feeling. Whats worse is that I am not sure it will be continued, the author or publisher did not indicate a sequel or follow up! Whats the deal!!! I want to know what happens to John.A great book! -dn"
3,"not as spicy as I expected, but good anyway","I expected more heat but I did enjoy them. For someone who likes rice crackers, they would be great, but don't expect fire."
3,not hot,"When I've purchased these crackers in the past, they have had a decent bite to them. Afterall, they are Chili Bits. But, this time, they were very mild. They are still a good rice cracker, just not what I expected."
3,Hapi Chili Bits,Might have got a bigger rating but I was suppose to get 12 pkg. and only got 11. I sent amazon an email but they did not respond. Very disappointed. When you pay for something you expect to get the full amount. Because of that and no response will never order again.
1,Shipping outrageous,Want to get two of these belts and they come from the same supplier but they want to charge $8 EACH to ship. Cmon guys!
3,OK clock; not exactly what I expected.,"This is a battery-operated only clock. From the description, I thought it could either be plugged in or run on batteries. Also, the display only lights up when you push the backlight button. Therefore, you can't see what time it is in the dark without fumbling for a button. The clock does set the time itself and shows indoor temperature as well. I kept it to avoid the hassle of sending it back, but it could have been better described."
2,Not a great product,"The button for the backlight on this clock intermittently does not work and sometimes only works after about 10 button presses. The only way to turn on the alarm is the ""alarm set"" button, but the only way to get it to stop beeping is to push the button again about 4 times. Very irritating when you are getting up in the morning. The clock seems to be about 4 minutes off. I'm getting another clock to replace this one soon."

2,The Best of Olivia Newton -John,"This DVD shows Olivia singing about 5 , mostly forgettable songs, while posing in mostly dumb sets. I remember Olivia, apparently at her best, when she was doing a live concert."
2,NOT the best of Olivia Newton John,"This DVD had only 5 tracks and only two fo those were some of the ""Best"" of Olivia Newton John"
4,olivia sample - we need more,this video collection is only a start and while it is a good sample - there is so much more that could have been added - there is no complete olivia video collection of all her hits and it is time the record companies paid homage to her and all her hits and give the fans an ultimate collection on DVD - this is only a start.
4,What's up with the audio playback on computer DVD drives?!,"It seems the audio in all these ""20th Century Masters - DVD Collections"" is nothing but static when played on a computer DVD drive (tried 3 different one's!), but when played on a regular standalone DVD player it plays fine. Why is that?"
3,pretty good but hoping for more,always dug me some Olivia Newton John.dug Her videos alright&Her vibe. I wish there more than these few videos.I think there should be more to highlight Her Career.still this makes for a pretty good complilation.
5,Olivia finally gets her own DVD.....,"...Kudos to Hip-O for listening to the fans and not bringing us another issue of GREASE songs. Instead, they've dipped into the vaults for some lesser seen videos(from her FANTASTIC album ""Totally Hot"") and, of course, Physical(an obvious choice and most her celebrated video as it won a Grammy Award in it's day) and Heart Attack. Let's hope this one is a success and Hip-O brings us either a volume 2 or the full on DVD's of her Physical video album and her videos from the movie ""Two of a Kind"" and her solo project ""Soul Kiss""."
1,Same as Video Gold!,"Don't get me wrong, I love Olivia.. I bought that DVD.. but also bought the DVD Video Gold vol.1 and 2. The songs on this DVD are ALL on the other 2 compilations that have a lot more than this... In other words, if you haven't bought it, but have bought (or will buy) the GOLD set, then DON'T buy this one here...Same thing..."
4,"""Totally Hot"" Vintage Olivia!!!!","At last, Olivia fans have a DVD video collection to call their own! New from the ""20th Century Masters Collection"" is this budget DVD with five Olivia videos to enjoy. Although three of the videos are quite similar, considering that they each feature video from Olivia's photo shoot from her ""Totally Hot"" album cover, and of Olivia recording in the studio, this is a must have for her fans. Olivia never looked better, and it's all there for us to enjoy! Fans of cheesy, early 80's videos will appreciate the videos ""Heart Attack"" and Olivia's most popular song, ""Physical."" Hopefully, with enough positive responses, we'll see more Olivia music DVD's to come in the near future."
2,buy Olivia Newton John video gold instead,"Yes, it would cost around $20 instead of $7 to buy both of the two Olivia Newton John video gold dvds, but to get 39 videos instead of 5 is worth it."
2,Not DVD quality,"Great to see these videos again but video quality is not up to DVD standards, grainy."
5,Watch this with someone you want to know REALLY well,"..because it will make you know yourself better. ""Slaughter Rule"" is a noun; it stops the game short of a massacre. For anyone who knows Montana, the cinematography alone will call for the kleenex box. Thoughtfully cast with real-looking talent, the film explores intimacy as only hard times can. Adhering to their own mercy rule, the Smith brothers don't play sissy games with you. They tastefully portray Montana culture as art. If you qualify, they will show you why people choose to live there. It was refreshing to see a film with real people, real character development. This one's a must for anyone with a soul."
5,Great movie!,"See this movie! The performances of Ryan Gosling and particularly, David Morse (The Green Mile, Proof of Life, The Rock and TV's Hack) are amazing. I loved this film, and was really affected by it. The story is beautiful, sad, touching and heartbreaking. I fell in love with the characters, and couldn't stop thinking about them. The DVD's commentary (by directors Alex and Andrew Smith) is also outstanding, especially if you're interested in behind-the-scenes info. I can't recommend this highly enough!"
4,wasteland,"I bought the DVD because, sadly, I had missed the screenings and couldn't find it for rental anywhere. The Jay Farrar music and the Indians were the reasons for me seeing it. To be a little critical, it came off as Cohen-brothers lite; if you strung together all the slower sequences of Blood Simple and Fargo, you'd have this movie. I did like the fact that nothing followed convention, and the hopelessness of living was conveyed well. I could've done without the scene near the end where a Native drives up in warpaint, hair flowing, on a motorcycle - it's like things turned into a Sherman Alexie story all of the sudden."
2,All hype no show,"Well I can't agree with those other folks on this one. The only good thing about this film was the scenery. This is just another movie making us Montana folks look like a bunch of hicks. Oh sure, all Montana teenagers go down to the bar for beers after the game! They could have at least shown us a little more 6 man football. I guess hearing Wylie Gustafson was OK but that just about sums up the good parts for me. The first fifteen minutes I damn near shut this one down. My only regret is that I didn't. Don't waste 4 bucks or 2 hours on this one."
1,Too old!!!,"I bought this cd for my daughters' basketball team - but luckily played it before giving it to her/them as a present. The music is old - way too old for the 13 year olds on the team and old even for me... and I thought it would be a ""rev up"" ""here come the players"" motivational music to play at practices for before games. Forget that. It has slow moving OLD music."
5,A tour de force first novel!,"You don't have to know anything at all about Sylvia Plath to enjoy Kate Moses' magnificent and supple writing. She has taken well-trodden literary ground and made it seem, at least to this reader (who has a whole shelf of Plath books and bios), all new, all fresh.This is one book that I know I'll re-read. Kate Moses has an unerring feel for the conflicts and joys inherent of one woman's literary and domestic spheres of life. I look forward to seeing more from Moses in the years to come."
2,nothing new here,"i have read many of the books about sylvia plath as well as her own works. this book takes a small period of her life before her death, probably the worst years of plath's tragic life. this reads like an addendum to the biography written by diane middlebrook."
2,Maybe Someday,"I have great respect for Sylvia Plath. I have read her semi-autobiographical work ""The Bell Jar,"" and found it to be an easy read. This book ""Wintering"" was not an easy read for me. I admit I didn't finish it. I got too irritated with the never-ending, detailed upon detailed descriptive narrative. What I am trying to say is, the author, Kate Moses, went a little too over-board with describing details, surroundings, smells, sights, sensations for my taste. I love good description. I want to have a feel for the surroundings, but this was like eating too much rich cake. Please, no more. I stopped feeling like I was reading a book about Sylvia Plath, and began to feel like I was in an English literature or grammar class reading descriptive narrative for whatever benefit.Maybe I'll go back to this book later and have a whole new perspective. Maybe I'm just not in the mood for this book. If other reviewers loved this book, I respect that. I found ""The Bell Jar"" much easier to read."
1,are you kidding?,"I really can't believe this book got so many good reviews. I bought this book because I have an intense fear of freeway driving. I thought maybe this book would have some good advice. The title of the book should really be ""How to Drive."" Because that's really all it is, a glorified drivers ed manual.Also, I found that the author seems to be very chauvinistic regarding women drivers. The book reads like it was written in the fifties."
5,Teaches proper car handling and steering techniques,"This is one of the best driving books I've ever read. The book is about 196 pages broken into specific chapters. The author goes into proper techniques about how to steer the car, brake and accelerate in everyday driving situations. There are too many books out there that assume the driver already know how to handle the car. Following driving rules and advice is one thing, but how a car handles is another thing. Also for those afraid of driving, he even has a few chapters devoted to that so you will be out in the road in no time."
5,Saved my laptop!,"When the keybpad stopped workign for certain keys, my first thought was - I need a new laptop!!! Yikes!!! But, I put the problem and model into Google, and found a Youtube video explaining exactly how to replace the keypad! I ordered this keypad, it came in packaged perfectly, I reviewed the Youtube video again and changed the thing in 7 minutes!!!! My laptop has been saved for a small price and I did it myself! I know this product saved me a hundred dollars in diagnosis and repair fees!!! It has been working perfectly since!!! ANYBODY can change the keypad!!! Do not even worry about it. Do what I did and and save a ton of money! Great product!"
5,Too Easy!,Seeing just how simple it was to replace -- I put up a broken keyboard for far too long. Works great!
4,Great replacement part,Had a keyboard go bad in a laptop and after looking for a replacement part found it on Amazon and at a fair price. Shipped quickly and packaged nice and tight. Good job!
3,Not as wide ranging as the reviews led me to believe,"I read the review in New Scientist, and liked the sound of this book. When it arrived I read the blurb on the back, and was further encouraged by the fact that a Sociology Professor was encouraging students to read it. I was therefore expecting a reasonably tough but rewarding read (my math is at undergraduate level and somewhat dated, but I do make an effort). Instead with the exception of a few pieces of commentary, particularly at the beginning, I found the book virtually impenetrable because of the denseness of the mathematical modelling techniques used. I suspect this is one strictly for the experts, and those with excellent post-graduate math skills."
2,Not enough contents to be a good book,"Networks are since a couple of years object of intense research in several different disciplines. One reason therefore is certainly the outstanding article by Watts and Strogatz, Collective dynamics of small world networks, Nature, 393:440--442, 1998. Unfortunatelly, this book can not continue the high level of this article. Actually, it does not really provide much more information than the article itself. I would suggest to read the article cited above and either decide for another book or to look directly in the literature and read the origninal articles.To summarize, this book is not terribly weak, but one can clearly sees that it swims on the current 'complex networks' wave without providing enough justification for its existence. Of course, if you do not have access to the original literature and just what to have a general overview of complex networks and what be done with them, you may consider buying this book."
5,"This book is for the moderately intellectual observers, not the closed-minded","If you are ""subject to change"", this book is for you. If you ever came across a few oddities in life and wondered what was behind closed curtains, this is the book for you.P.S: The front cover is the logo for the University of Birmingham, for all those who drew that question. It represents the ideals of perception, and also the lies and deceit of the the past and present."
4,"NOT the final word, but a good conversation starter...","""Could an increase in access to abortion procedures in the 1970s lead to a lower crime rate in the 1990s?"" These and other ""out there"" theories are translated from the PhD sophistication of Econometric Analysis into a reader-friendly set of short written segments.It follows, then, that Levitt's strength of using a reader-friendly style is also this book's weakness. For example, after reading the abortion and crime segment, those with a statistics or econometrics background will say ""interesting, but how did he account for the fact that parenting and society's guidance system improved during those 20 years?"" Since Freakonomics lacks any rigourous details about the research methodology used, such questions cannot be answered.Still, this book remains and interesting and easy read that does not provide all of the answers, but does raise some interesting possiblities."
1,Boring and pedantic to listen to on CD.,"I couldn't make it past the second chapter even though the stories and ideas were engaging. As an audio product, the narrator repeats himself too many times and recaps and re-summarizes again and again. It's hard to listen to. If you're kind of slow, this CD may be just your speed. If you're sharp, you will be bored out of your skin. Perhaps an abridged version would be easier to sit through. It's too watered down and repetitive - at least as an audio version where you can't skim to avoid the redundancy."
4,Freakonomics [Revised and Expanded]: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,"Freakonomics [Revised and Expanded]: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything: I consider this book ""required reading"" for all who're the financial ""head-of-household"". The hidden meaning behind commonly mis-understood financial concepts are defined through detailed mathematics in this book. I truly enjoyed this book and consider it a real ""eye-opener"". ~~>> B.A.Ritter, Dallas, TX."
3,maybe worth reading - not worth going to read,"Prepare to be dazzled, says Malcolm Gladwell's blurb on the cover. I'm afraid I wasn't. Maybe the hype overinflated my expectations, but I can't really see what the deal is supposed to be. We get a bunch of interesting, but for the most part not terribly surprising, vaguely socioeconomic observations (sumo wrestlers cheat - really?), but these could be summarised in a few pages - and indeed have been, since I learned nothing I didn't already know from the hype/reviews.We also get a 'lite' middlebrow prose style that happens to set my teeth slightly on edge; if you don't have a problem with this, then Freakonomics may be worth keeping around for your next night in a Holiday Inn, but that's about its limit as an achievement."
1,wait for the paperback,"if you read it at all. Very dissappointing. I do not doubt that Levitt is capable of asking meaningful questions and devising sophisticated analyses, but that does not come through in this book. The theories are largely unsupported by data (at least data that are cogently presented), flaws and shortcomings in the analyses are not adequately described and commented upon, and much of the text is dumbed-down, self-evident gibberish, or idle speculation - take for example the entire chapter devoted to children's names. I certainly hope that this book does not speak for the current art and science of sociological analysis and I wonder if Levitt was not ""coaxed"" into participating in this project by an adoring and fawning Dubner, who admittedly has a proclivity for ""hero worship"". Is he responsible for the sophomoric tone of the text and its lack of supporting data?"
2,Boring.,"I can't believe an entire book was created about such minutia, nor did I find the process by which they came to some of their conclusions to be so profound. Thank god I only picked this up at the library. After a quick perusal through the book on a train ride home, I decided to return it. I found it tres boring."
2,not really economics,"This is one of the more overrated books on economics out there, first and foremost because most of its content has little to do with economics. It should really just be called ""what the statistics tell us"". It really lacks any of the insights into behavior and outcomes that are found when one is really utilizing economic principles. In fact, its focus on statistics reinforces the wrong perception that economics is all about numbers and math - it's not. At it's core, it's about fundamental and basic principles of human psychology, behavior and the difference between intent and desire and result."
3,Pretty interesting,I had to read this book for my MicroEcon class and it was certainly the most interesting part of the class. The book gives a unique viewpoint of economics-using examples from sumo wrestlers to drug gangs. I found the chapter about baby names particularly interesting. A decent read- for an economics book.
3,too much hype,How this became the bestseller with all the buzz is beyond me. The insightful statistical analyses could have been boiled down to about 15 pages. The section on parenting was its only saving grace.
5,required reading for the hip and informed,"Just like the butterfly in Bradbury's story, everything has some effect on something. This book illuminates these effect very well"
2,Leaves Much To Be Desired,"I had high anticipation and expectations for this book considering the hype surrounding it's release, but was sorely disappointed. After the first chaper I should have stopped reading; the writers had already revealed the most interesting ""revelations"" of the book. The following chapters are a mix of redundancy and narcissism. Seriously, the book should be called freakygeeks: the not so hidden ego of the authors. Don't get me wrong, I love the economic lense focused on abscure subjects, but this seemed hastily written to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Those arrogant pricks, I think they purposely left much to be desired so that they could write a sequel."
4,A Thoroughly Enjoyable Read,"Knowing very little about economics, I approached this book a bit timidly as a swimmer diving into cold water. After the first few pages, I was hooked; the authors make this very accessible to the masses and left me craving more I particularly enjoyed the last two chapters on parenting and the discussion of baby names, which discussed evidence for theories I'd suspected for quite some time. After reading this, I feel as though I have gained a new skill for thinking critically about the way current issues of politics and policy are presented to us in the media."
2,nonplussed,Perhaps I was expecting too much given the cover banter...by page 43 I was dragging myself through Mssr. Levitt's observations as to whether Sumo wrestling could be rigged. In between each chapter is a paragraph dedicated to the homage of the author. By chapter two I was eager to catch a glimpse of the statistical realities that would explain why I just dropped twenty-five bucks on this book.
1,"Anecdotal, only for the gullible","There is no need to say much. The book is sometimes fun to read but it is really just more, poorly based, sensationalist journalism than anything else. It's a prime example of the misuse of statistics. Anecdotes are dangerous; the book is filled with them. The speculations are just that: pure speculation. The authors play journalist and cite few if any rigorous studies. They contradict themselves (see sections on capital punishment). It's an OK book to stimulate discussion, but not a source of factual information. It falls in my junk category."
2,Overrated,"A vastly overrated book, studies the similarities beween odd situations and why this happen. OR Why the Ku Klux Klan has things in common with Real Estate Agents. Why do drug dealers live with their mother?Whilst it states good theories, the book is too light on evidence to be convincing. The 'new' rear section of Bonus material is almost 100 pages in itself and should juist be called a chapter and be done with it.Not up to the hype, I have read better books with actual facts in them that are more entertaining."
2,Highly overrated state of the stone age economics,"This book has been highly overrated. That is the reason i decide to write this review. For someone with decent knowledge about economics there is nothing new to find in this book. No new methods, no new theory, no groundbreaking insights.The only thing the writers succeded in showing is that people are selfish and motivated by economic incentives. This statement is even true for schoolteachers and sumowrestlers (state of the art science if you ask me). This might be entertaining, but is certainly not groundbreaking. The statistical methods the writers use are funny but not groundbreaking either.This book makes good reception conversation and can easily be read on the toilette or in the tube. If you wish to buy it for those purposes I can really recommend this."
2,"Topics sound interesting but should be ""Freakonomics for Dummies""","This book is as popular as it is intellectually devoid of any concrete material. The authors have managed to get good topicnames and chapter openings but the content is superficial. If you read the book carefully and think about it, you can summarize the book in 5-10 pages.It is interesting to read because of the correlations but nothing more than that.Levitt and Messrs have used regressions, etc to only make it sound scientific but anyone equipped with economics 101 will know this stuff.Again, this book is at a very preliminary level. The material is inspired from ""The tipping point"" and if you have read that book, you can see that the authors have used similar examples. Maybe they just want to ride the success of other popular books.But I must give it to them - they make you think about hidden causalities."
1,"Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics",This authors of this unfortunate book have a penchant for using statistics to attempt to explain their version of major social issues. Unfortunately there is a huge logic gap between the statistics they use and the conclusions they reach. I suspect the authors skipped out on their basic logic classes. Not worth the cheap paper it's written on. Mine went into the garbage.
2,More please...,"The book is a fun read, but lacks statistical, technical, detail; perhaps that's understandable; not a lot of surprises. It has long been known that swimming pools are more deadly than hand-guns in terms of over-all child mortality and cars more statistically deadly than airplanes. I applaud the authors for taking on ONE of the long term effects of the Roe V. Wade decision. I had suspected that such a causal correlation between crime and abortion had existed for some time. I only wish they had taken it one step further, and explored more of the ""counterintuitive"" effects of Roe V. Wade on our free market capitalist society; such as the causal correlation between the huge influx and greater diffusity of illegal immigrant workers in our society some thirty years hence Roe V. Wade. I think, there too, is a causal connection between the post Roe V. Wade shrinkage of the domestic ""cheap"" (poor) labor pool and illegal immigrant labor demand."
5,Grand entertainment,"The book starts with a provocative claim: That the huge drop in crime in the 1980's was directly attributable to the passage of Roe v Wade. What's great about it is that there's no moralizing. Just because Roe v Wade caused less unwanted and underpriveleged children to be born, doesn't mean that killing the unborn is right. But let's be honest when we discuss social issues.I had an Economics professor in college who used this exact approach to use basic Economics principles to demonstrate why certain things happened in the real world. He was a huge inspiration so this book was a very rewarding find.It's a quick read, entertaining and fun all the way through. And it's guaranteed to blow your mind at least once."
2,I found this book a little random,"To be fair to the authors they do tell you that.There is no story, no overall connecting theme. It jumps from story to story more like a novel that a business book.It is fun, interesting and well written and you do get some good stories to remember and tell.I guess it depends on your tastes.I've even saw them both talk at a company event and I had the same reaction - highly entertaining, but a little unconnected."
3,Good..but I wanted a little more,Very fun and an easy read. I just thought the book was too simplistic at times...drawing conclusions that seemed to over extrapolate the statistical evidence. Maybe I just need to study the numbers myself.
3,"Moderately entertaining, but did not live up to the hype.","I read this because of all of the hype. I was not ""dazzled"", as the blurb on the cover suggested I would be. It wasn't a bad book, I just don't get what the big deal is.I thought that this was a moderately entertaining book that read more like a series of unrelated articles. I'm not convinced that the conclusions that they came to are of any merit and I don't really care enough about it to do any further research on my own.It brought up some interesting ideas and I like that this may encourage people to be more unconventional in the the things that they study and the questions that they ask.Perhaps if I were an economist or a student studying economics, this would feel fresh and groundbreaking. Instead I am just a chick who likes books and I finished this one with a shrug.If you are an avid reader, go ahead and read it, just be prepared to not be dazzled. Be prepared for an okay read that may be more impressive if you ignore the hype."
4,Freakonomics is an entertaining read that makes you think in new ways about issues,Economist Steven Levitt and journalist Stephen Dubner examine the role incentives play in modern society. The authors use a variety of fascinating studies from sumo wrestling to the KKK to illustrate their points. Freakonomics is an entertaining read that makes you think in new ways about issues.
4,Great Book!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I gave me a lot of insight into topics that I never even thought about. It was a great and fast reed but always kept me wanting to turn the next page (for the most).
3,Less than expected,"This book does draw you in through compelling topics, but drifts off towards the end. The author makes some convincing arguments, yet many pages were spent taking readers in circles when all info in this book could have been conpressed to a pamphlet."
5,My favorite EVER!,"This is an excellent book that will get you to think ""outside the box"". You'll love it. Its easy to read and the men who wrote it have a great sence of humor."
5,"Enjoyable, engaging, funny, witty","I was hooked and laughing out loud before I finished the preface. Between Dubner's sharp, witty, funny writing and Levitt's creative explorations, this book is spellbinding. I kept reading parts to my husband all night. No, it's not too deep on methodology, but this is meant to be provacative, yet readable--for laymen. Statisticians might find this lacking as a technical piece, but witty and provocative as recreational reading."
1,A disappointment,"The title is arresting, the cover art cute, and there are a couple of moderately engaging chapters (the relation of Roe v. Wade to crime rates, for example). But are we really surprised to learn that those who sell drugs on street corners are not on the fast track for promotion, that in the days of No Child Left Behind testing teachers will help their students cheat (or cheat for them) so that their schools won't be penalized? By the concluding examination of black and white names and the success rates associated with them, the authors are thrashing about in their data and arriving at conclusions most would find to be pretty banal."
2,It's OK,"Before I read this book, I was told that it was the most thought provoking piece of literature in the last decade. Everyone I talked to raved about it, and said that the way they look at things will be forever changed. This is a slight exaggeration, but not far from my actual experience.After reading this book and being thoroughly disappointed, I have to ask the question - Have you actually ever thought about these issues before? If you had, Levitt's answers would seem pretty obvious... The book isn't bad per say, but it definitely is not worthy of praise. Seriously people, let's think about it. Drownings are more common than accidental gun shots? How many pools are there in America versus hand guns? How much more likely are small children to play at a pool without being supervised? Shocked? Hardly.If you have thought about any of these issues before, the book is not worth your time, energy, or money."
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book. Don't let the subtitle throw you -- you don't need to be an economist or have a major in math -- you just need to be searching for the truth. The conventional wisdom is often wrong and this book shows some particular cases and revealing new concepts. It is like you are tagging along with a ""truth"" investigator and filming the action in progress."
2,Good short story; boring book,"This is the most over-hyped book I can remember reading. If you've read a magazine or newspaper article about some of the book's insights, then you already know all you need to, as the book jams 30 pages of interesting info into 200 pages. The last 20 pages or so is mainly lists of names to try to make some point that is beaten to death...snore."
4,A New Look at Our World,"Levitt is the professor that every student who's suffered through basic economics wishes they'd had. Instead of tackling dry topics, Levitt takes on the juicy stuff -- crack dealing, abortion, crime, and real estate agents, to name a few -- and discusses why people act the way they do.It was a bit tough to read this in only a few sittings... it seems to me to be more a collection of essays or articles than a ""book,"" per se, but still, it was compelling, well-written, and accessible.Makes me want to pull out my old econ texts, dust them off, and try my hand at a little economic research."
3,Quickonomics,"Not bad, but also not too substantial. A number of the more interesting topics were raised in the 2003 New York Times Magazine article which pretty much spawned this book. Having read it cover to cover in three hours or so, I am somewhat disappointed not much else is brought to the table. If you missed the article it's a four star book."
2,"Fun beach reading, but no dazzle...","The cover promises ""Prepare to be dazzled"" and I expected so much more. This is a very thin book (double spaced & wide margins, 200 pages in total) and can be read in one day at the beach. You can find some interesting statistics, for example which words work best in real estate ads. But by no means should this book be categorized in Popular Economics on Amazon. Save your money and check out this book from your local library."
3,Not as great as I had expected,"I bought this book as I had heard great reviews about it. After reading countless reviews I bought it. I was a little disappointed. I personally dont believe that abortion rates can be connected with crime rates. That is quite a far reach, and in the book i don't believe it is properly explained. Secondly the author tried to show the similarities between the KKK and real estate brokers. Again, a far reach. Overall i think my expectations were too high, but if you want to buy it... Go ahead."
3,Interesting topic not a great book,"The beginning of the book warns you that the authors are not there to follow through with a unifying theme. And indeed they don't. The book is enjoyable simply from the expositions on a interesting variety of topics and several examples of robust thought. Problem is that there is a hint of a theme, i.e. rational empirically-based problem solving, and no follow through.I liked the book and it was worth the time just for the interesting anecdotal examination of topics. However, at the end they slip into same trap that their hint of a theme wants to contradict, sloppy thinking. The last chapter, examining people's names and the relation to their success, seemed to fill pages with no purpose other than to get the page count to 200."
4,Interesting and all,"This is an interesting book but it's by no means an educational or earth shaking. As the authors mentioned, this is a collection of articles which were published various times. I liked it a lot - pretty amusing:)"
4,"""Information is a beacon, a cudgel, an olive branch, a deterrent. . .","The economic theorist Steven Levitt has apparently been shocking the world with his revelations. The main purpose of this book, he states, is to teach us to challenge conventional wisdom. He points out the power of information to shape our actions and how often this information is faulty or deliberately false.Levitt presents facts about human motivation in readable prose. In particular he points out the economic pressures that cause many from teachers to real estate agents to twist the truth. He states that if morality represents the ideal world, economics motivates the real world.This book does not hesitate to provide unpopular information that our culture does not want to hear: such as that allowing women to decide about abortion lowers crime rates.If you are interested in challenging your own preconceptions about how the world works, then this is the books for you!"
3,Same old popular economics book,"A lot of people made this sound like a different type of economics book but it's not. It's the same old type of book where the author tries to popularize economics by making seemingly outrageous statements. It's basically the same book as the Armchair Economist and the Hidden Order, both books that are written only to make the authors try to look more important than they really are.But the book makes some really good points and certainly makes you think about a few things. Unfortunately it was overly verbose at 200 pages and probably would have been better as a 50 page book or magazine article.If you want a layman's introduction to economics I would suggest Naked Economics by Charles Wheelan, it's a much better book."
2,Freaky alright,"Freakonomics was a good magazine article streached into a weak book. In some passages about sensitive topics, the authors clearly were afraid to make their own conclusions."
5,Thinking Outside the Box (and if the box wasn't a box...?),"Everything that can be connected is connected. A thought that never would have occurred to you suddenly makes all the sense in the world. Can a butterfly in the Amazon cause a typhoon in Japan? This book does not emphasize right or wrong, fact or fiction; it emphasizes what a person can see, learn or understand when you break out of conventional thinking. There is something telling every human what to do almost every minute of every day: the road signs tell you what to do, the boss, the teacher, the commercials, the government, etc. When you actually stop and ask the question, ""Well...why"" and then begin an investigation into the heart of everything, then you are on your way to becoming an individual thinker. Don't buy this book if you want any other outcome except to become more aware of the world around you and to have a clearer picture of the influences that surround us every day."
3,"Fails to be compelling, still entertains","There's something to be said about a book that brings up new ideas and changes our way of thinking. Freakanomics may be one of these books, but it does not rate highly on the overall list. A lot of interesting examples are given, but without a lot of real data nad just some passing insightful observations. Think more along the lines of Gladwell's ""Tipping Point"" rather than Schlosser's ""Fast Food Nation""; both were books about big important ideas that were interesting and well written, only one really seemed to have a lot of meat to it.The book reads like a very interesting magazine article. It opens your worldview a bit, maybe causes some discussion, but you won't need it around as a reference. If that is what you are expecting, it is excellent. For those who maybe wanted a bit more, it is disappointing."
1,A Dangerous Abuse of Statistics,"In the beginning of the book, I found the author's use of simple statistics to find new ways of looking at social phenomenon interesting and refreshing. By the end of the book I was outraged when he started ""proving"" his theories by statistics. Linear regression is powerful tool in understanding simple systems with one or two variables. Applying it to the complex realm of the social sciences to draw the far reaching conclusions Leavitt draws is irresponsible. If you are going to use science, use it appropriately. If you read this book, PLEASE read a good book on the PROPER use of statistics and know that THIS is not it!"
4,Making the subject of economics relevent to the common man.,"I originally purchased this book, after listening to one of the authors on NPR. I purchased one for my father and one for myself, and since both me and my husband have been fighting over our copy, as it is such an interesting read. It goes quickly, but makes economic principles simple to grasp. Even if you have no interest in the subject you will find the comparisons intriguing."
4,Better but not Best...,"I had the privilege of reading Levitt's work in college when studying The Economics of Crime. His work is bold insofar as he is willing to see arguments to their logical conclusion. Where Levitt and other economists cum sociologists run into trouble is in their necessary reliance on data that must be pieced together through induction. Much of what Levitt addresses lacks the very empiricism that 99 percent of economists rely on as a central crutch in all that they do. This is not to say he is wrong (or even less correct). However, his arguments are probably best suited to the reader who is already in agreement with much of what he says."
4,Commendable Effort,"Levitt's ""Freakonomics"" is an accessible read that examines non-traditional (or at least less-scrutinized) economic topics with traditional -- albeit fundamental -- economic tools in a novel & nuanced way. Levitt is a gifted economist insofar as he has the ability to articulate unique questions and, perhaps more importantly, to retrieve data that can be used to answer his question(s). If you are expecting to see rigourous proofs, mathematical formulae, and the standard offering of economic vernacular, then you may be disappointed. If, however, you want to read an eclectic & entertaining collection of essays exploring everything from the role of information in the Ku Klux Klan to the importance (or lack therein) of a baby's name, then this book is certainly worth reading."
3,Meh,"This book was somewhat interesting, but looking back, I think I honestly would have been better off buying some beer instead of this book."
2,LIghtweight,This would have been a good magazine article or two or even three but not enough material for a whole (expensive) book. Nor was there a centralizing theme other than the author's interest in testing data.
2,Yawn!,Like many other readers I was completely underwhelmed by this book. On the plus side it is so easy to read you won't waste much of your time on it.
1,COMPLETELY INACCURATE!!!,This book is a JOKE! If you believe anything in it then Give me a call! I have some ocean-front property in Arizona for sale for ya' Real Cheap too!! The authors need to spend a little more time reporting accurate and truthful information and a little less time manipulating the numbers to appear the way they want them to. This book is a giant collection of false information - If you read it then Your probably dumb enough to actually believe whats in it.
2,Why aren't reviewers and other economists angry?,"I was very disappointed with this book. It can cause people to belitle economics, particularly with the way Mr. Levitt makes some pretty rash conclusions. A most telling example is his link between abortions and the lower crime rate. Where are the actual figures? The incidence of violent crimes dropped from 1.9 million to 1.4 million between 1991 and 2000 - how does that really relate to the 16 million abortions that took place in that decade? The author talks too often about percentage movements, but a more thorough investigation of the numbers will prove that most of his ideas cannot be corroborated. I am surprised economists, reviewers and the pro-life community are not angry."
1,This is a really bad book,This book is about three things: self adulation; children that are not aborted grow up to be criminals; reasons why drug dealers live at home with their parents.
1,Good Book poor presentation,"I had many recommendations for this book and had read some of it, so I purchased it to give as a christmas gifts to my boss and mis boss's boss. Imagine my surprise when the books arrived with torn pages. The sides of the pages looked like they had been hand torn and not guillotined. I had no time to have them exchanged however, and had to explain this embarassing situation to the gift receivers!VERY POOR QUALITY CONTROL"
2,Bad analogies,"It's true...some Realtors do sell their own property for more money then the client they represented that only wanted to pay a 2% commissions; it's classic Economics you get what you pay for. Also, they could have saved a few trees and made the same point; why too much babbling at times I had to get the tooth picks out to keep my eyes open."
1,FREAKEN WRONG,"IF LEVITT TITLED HIS BOOK ECONOMICS 101, NO ONE WOULD BUY OR READ IT. HE SHOULD GO BACK & READ ECONOMICS 101, TO REFRESH HIS UNDERSTANDING OF IT.FIRST, BLUE CRIME RATE GOES DOWN IN GOOD TIMES (UNDER CLINTON) & GOES UP IN BAD TIMES (UNDER REPUBILCANS). WHITE COLLAR CRIME GOES UP WITH DEREGULATION (UNDER REPUBLICANS). IT GOES DOWN WITH REGULATION & OVERSIGHTS UNDER DEMOCRATS. TO SUGGEST THAT THE INCREASE IN ABORATIONS AMONG MINORITIES CAUSES A DECREASE IN CRIME IS SOME KIND OF JOKE. FUNNY, ONLY TO LEVITT. WHEN YOU JUDGE WHITE COLLAR CRIME, VS BLUE COLLAR CRIME. WHITE COLLAR CRIME WINS HANDS DOWN WITH THE DAMMAGE TO SOCIETY. IT DISTROYES THE INTRASTRUCTURE, CREATING CHAOS IN THE FINANCIAL SECTURE WITH ITS TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT ON THE WORLD ECONOMY & MARKETS. REAGANOMICS & IT'S EXTENSION BUSHONOMICS ARE NOT RANDOM BY CHANCE PLANS. BUT A WELL PLANNED REVISION OF THE WILLIE SUTTON PLAN (ROB BANKS, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS). THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO MILTON FREIDMAN MENTALITY SUCKS."
4,"Really freaked out, not Mr Levitt but we as a Society","Once I understood the how freaky our society and systems are with my very own incidents in life, I kind of digested the fact that there are many senseless things happen every day. In one of my court battles I lost the case to a defendant who did not even attend the hearing. None of the Levitt's conclusions surprised me at all. But there are some places I felt that his cause and effect analysis is kind of far fetched.His ideas on making to ivy league schools, success in life, role of parenting are one convincing to me. Certain things such as unique and distinct qualities of people impact careers rthan parental guidance. Thats very true and gives me encouragement to so many disadvantaged kids with higher fundamental qualities as a person."
1,Disappointing,A very pessimistic take on our great country for purposes of pushing a political agenda. Its no wonder this book is so well liked by the New York Times. There is too much opinion and not enough evidence in the pages of this book.
1,FALLACY,"This was one of the worst excuses for non-fiction I've ever read. Anyone with a degree in a quantitative discipline should be able to recognize nearly every single conclusion in this book as fallacy and coincidence. The author even goes as far as to dismiss widely held conclusions about some of the issues with no way to back up his dismissals. There's also no methodology described for how he came to his conclusions. The other revelations in this book that deal with statistics (not economics) essentially state that people will do what's in their best interest regardless of their morals. Big shocker there... There is not one shred of logic or reason in here. If you disagree, please look up 'fallacy' in the dictionary, then please take a logic class."
5,Great Book. Different perspective of looking at stats,Great Book. Different perspective of looking at statistics. It does help me in questions the numbers more before making decisions.
2,I was prepared to be dazzled...,"A fairly interesting book and a very easy read. But I was hardly dazzled. I am not an academic and did not pick this book up for insights into economic theory, but it read more like something I would use to liven up cocktail party conversation than as an insightful reference. It seems more like a long puff piece on Steven Levitt than anything else. I love iconoclasts and so am always glad to see someone (in this case, Levitt) poke holes in accepted theory, but otherwise this book, while mildly entertaining, did not live up to its buzz."
4,"A great book, full of surprises","More than you can expet, Freakonomics is a great reading in a plain english style. Levitt at his best, pick it up!"
3,Interesting but....,"Decent read, but this book should really have much more extensive endnotes and citations. Much of the data seems as if it is pulled out of thing air."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I picked up this book thinking that I was in for a compelling read that would enlighten me as to how economic theories, or even an economic ""way of thinking"", would help me to understand social and other phenomena outside the field of economics. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed by what I found. While the authors have a sufficiently clear writing style and make a handful of interesting points, the book's very disjointed chapters made it hard to feel like I was learning anything relevant or worthwhile. The authors tell you right up front that the book lacks a ""unifying theme"", and they seem almost proud of that fact. In my opinion, that fact is what makes this collection of statistics and anecdotes not really worth a serious reader's time."
2,2 and 1/2 stars maybe...,"Although I am glad I read this book, I have read a lot better books that kept my attention better than this one. There were some really interesting and thought-provoking parts but it really lagged in some parts and was a bit boring in others, as well. An interesting take on things, though, and a very different kind of book...not horrible, not fabulous...somewhere in the middle."
3,pretty good read,"pretty decent book, I have seen the documentary of the same, and was quite interesting. In all, good if you can spare sometime and patience."
5,Great,Fun read. Maybe not a nobel peace prize nominee but fun. Few parts may be offensive to some of the more sensitive folks out there.
4,better than expected,"I had to read this book for an economics course. I don't really like economics in general, but this book really captured my attention. It was a fun and easy read, even for people who don't know anything about economics."
2,What's all the hype about?,"This book, one can afford to miss. With all of the other exceptional economic reads, many of which put out by the Mises Institute, by such authors as Hayek, Rothbard, Hazlitt, and Von Mises, I'm not entirely sure why this book receives so much praise, while the true reads receive so little. If you are a young economist or someone looking to understand anything about the market, how it works, the big picture in a meaningful way this book really isn't for you. This book does touch briefly on a couple of interesting topics that aren't commonly found in economic literature, such as the finances of a drug dealer. All in all though, I'm not overly impressed, and the authors have a way of presenting information in a more controversial way, when economic theory is controversial enough. Meaning that they have miss-quoted some of their supposed ""sources"". If you were my family or friend, I would tell you to, ""Pick something else, and optimize your time spent reading."""
5,Very Entertaining,"Great read, lots of fun and makes you think. Only downside is that it's too short."
4,Good - Not Great,"This is a good intro. Like other reviewers, I agree - this would have been a good magazine article (or series of magazine articles). This was clearly published to cash-in (not that that's all bad, but after all the hype I was hoping for more).Pros: Easy to read, engaging, interestingCons: I paid full-price, short (~200 pages / $25), doesn't dig-in deep enoughNow, granted, if I want a more in-depth study of Levitt's work, I'm sure there are any number of textbooks available to me, but this ""seemed"" like an intellectual book rather than a Readers Digest version padded-out into book form.Plus the hardcover version has uneven page widths (I'm sure there's a word for this) so the leafs resemble an old first edition. It is truly goofy."
5,"Quirky, interesting read","I really enjoyed this book prior to its ""big buzz"". I appreciated the range of topics and found it challenged conventional paradigms in a refreshing fashion.If you are looking for dry, in-depth economics, look elsewhere."
5,"Quick, enjoyable read","I have read some complaints regarding the validity of Levitt's research and his lack of raw data presentation. While it is difficult to determine the validity of his conclusions without his actual data, I don't think this book was marketed to the statistician crowd. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book was written with an absence of either conservative of liberal slant. In addition, while Dubner & Levitt do offer causal hypotheses they are fair-handed and quick to point different explanations. The authors merely make connections between variables and allow the reader to do with them what he will. Freakonomics is filled with interesting stories, facts and conversation pieces. It is my opinion that everyone could take something worth-while from this book."
5,Very fun to listen to,"This was a great book to listen to on my way to work. It is full of interesting statistics and definetly puts a few new spins on data. I have not heard the view expressed by Levitt about abortion and crime before. The book is full of entertaining points. It was interesting to find out how much drug dealers make and what is important in online dating. His funny views of the KKK and the popular names are entertaining. It definetly puts parents at ease about all the little stuff they do for their kids...he pretty much says that everything you could do for them you probably have already done (picked your lifestyle, partner, etc)...but of course all the little extras are nice gestures.He does a good and funny job of explaining how people are influenced by different incentives.Very fun to listen to. The conclusion is that data can help us answer many questions, but there will always be outliers."
2,Bogus abortion argument casts shadow on rest of book,"Though many of the topics covered here are truly fascinating and eye-opening, the ill-conceived argument that abortion reduces crime makes me skeptical about the book as a whole. Levitt bases his argument on some previously debunked assumptions and fails to take into account a number of additional factors. It's the economic equivalent of saying increased ice cream sales lead to increased crime. Fun to mull some of these things over, but c'mon, let's not simplify things to the point where you mislead your uneducated readers."
4,Great opening,"I just discovered this enlightening book after years of ignoring my friends' pleas to read it. I'm not much for statistics, but I finally picked it up during a slow weekend at work. The opening anecdote that sets the mood and purpose of the authors' thesis had me riveted, as I'm sure it had many people riveted. It's one of those rare instances when, reading it, you think, maybe everything I know is wrong. As a whole, the rest of the book doesn't rise to that level. It did keep me interested as best as it could (again, full disclosure, I'm not typically one for statistics), but I kept wanting it to get as good as it was during the first few pages. Still recommend this for pretty much anyone, though."
4,Freakonomics,"On the whole, the book is great as it is described. But it is better to improve the quality of paper."
4,Great Book!,Great book for stimulating the mind. This book definitely gets you thinking and keeps you interested throughout. Pick it up and you won't be disappointed. I sure wasn't!
1,Not much substance,"I found some of this book fun to read but ultimately it is mostly an empty read. Scant supporting evidence for many of the authors sometimes outrageous and inflammatory claims and assertions. Not to be taken seriously at best, irresponsible blather at worst.Save your money."
2,"Trivial, at best.","As an investment professional, I found this book to be an exploration in trvial information, better suited for someone attempting to get on Jeopardy than someone interested in understanding economic matters.It's not that a book on economics need be dismal or dull. But what it should be is informative as to how and why the complex subject of economics (which is the study of the social dynamics of people) in a globalized world actually works.We live in a dynamic time. Things are in flux. How a book on meaningless details that does not illuminate or enlighten does as well as this book is a mystery to me.I know it is a very popular book. But being popular doesn't equate to quality or value.On all accounts, this book sorely disappoints."
1,Do not buy this book,"Freakonomics is a book heavily marketed and backed by a major publisher. The hype surrounding this book was incredible. However, the contents are very disproportionate compared to the hype-meaning, that it's a bad investment. The authors fail very badly at rationalizing the cause and effects about the outcomes explored. The scary part is that they find correlations among a ""single-cause"" and somehow tunnel vision it to an affect, i.e., Roe vs. Wade with the decrease in crime. Unfortunately, any critical mind will find that an outcome, a many of times, has many ""effects"". What I mean, is that they fail to also acknowledge the increase in funding in social and educational programs, that maybe, had a bigger effect on crime than Roe vs. Wade. In short, do not waste your time with this book. If you do you will be instructed on ""how-not""- to- solve any-of -life's -mysteries."
3,An amusing & interesting read,"This amusing & interesting read reminded me of the best of my Economics lessons so many years ago. We did little to no maths but much on the quirky reasoning behind many Economics theories and their outcomes. (our grades were not good, but they probably were the lessons I learned most from.) This book is full of these - it applies Economics reasoning to modern social issues. I liked the connection between the Ku Klux Klan's demise & Superman. Everyone who is not yet a parent and wants to be one later should read chapters 5 & 6 before they are. If you are already one it is too late to read them.... A little too US focussed for non US readers perhaps and at times lends itself to speed reading (!) but a worthwhile read."
3,Freakonomics isn't all that Freaky -,"I looked forward to reading this, since a friend had recommended it. I found it a fast and interesting read, but a bit more scattered - a bit lighter than I'd expected. It was very credible, demonstrating the way variables had been controlled. If he writes another, I'll read it, but next time I'll check it out from the library rather than buy it."
1,Poor book (can't give 0 stars),This was a bad book. I bought this book because it was so much in news. I was severely disappointed. The tone of the book is very sophomoric. Nothing in the book sounds serious. The authors have started several chapters with notes in italics and these notes are full of self-aggrandization. The authors acknowledge that the book has no focus (they present this defect as if it is a virtue). They are absolutely right -- the book indeed has no focus.Some reviewers have commneted that this book presents a new way to look at the things. I think this book presents a new way to look at things to only those who have not been looking at the things to begin with. I did not learn anything new about economics from this book.
3,Entertaining but hardly freaky or unconventional,This is an entertaining read but it lacks any coherent message. It's basically just a bunch of studies done by two economists based on computational analysis of detailed public data. These two authors appear to fancy themselves as rogue and unconventional economists but they just come across as that nerdy kid who tries too hard to be cool. The chapter on their theory as to why the crime rate has fallen over the past 20 years is well worth reading but I found the rest of the chapters to be barely skim-worthy.
4,"Interesting Topics, Some Problems","I found the book both interesting and frustrating. The author's ideas were very interesting but not always well supported (IMHO). The author explains that correllation does not prove causality, but then seems to make the same mistake himself. The theory that legalization of abortion is to credit for the drop in crime rate is interesting, but is really only supported by attacking other theories for the drop in crime rate, not really showing that abortions were responsbible. The same can be said for many other discussions in the book. Still worth reading though."
3,Not like any other economic book,"The positive was that this book was an easy read. However, the content was somewhat ridiculous and was really not that stimulating. I was disappointed."
4,Gives a different perspective of economics.,"Crazyman's EconomicsI think it's interesting book and one that people should read to give them a new perspective of economics that doesn't put them to sleep. While one can certainly question some of the conclusions they draw, it starts a debate that isn't limited to academic snobs trying to ""out-intellectualize"" each other."
3,Clever but ultimately unsatisfying,"Levitt and Dubner offer interesting insights, clever analysis and pithy prose.But in the end the book just doesn't hang together. It would have been much more effective as a series of short essays.The authors acknowledge right up front that there's no unifying theme. But then they attempt to insert one by giving an appearance of a narrative arc, that ends up distracting more than illuminating.And the chapter on ""black"" names, ""white"" names, ""smart"" names and ""dumb"" names is just interminable. I wanted to shout GET TO YOUR POINT ALREADY. The depth of analysis is uneven; some chapters, like the black/white names, go into way too much detail, while others make wild unexplained leaps."
3,economics for everyone,"Interesting book with some examples of how economics principles can apply to everyday life, and sue interesting subjects. Easy reading and interesting enough to read it once and fun enough to through it without getting bored. It is innovative and well written. It contains some facts that give you an understanding of some things, good to add up to your social conversations, though not really useful for your everyday life. Overall a good read."
4,Made me think!,"While I am not completely sure that I agree with everything that the authors had to say, or the conclusions that they came to, they did have some very well thought out and interesting ideas. Their out of the box thinking style and the way in which they logically construct their arguments, made this book a refreshing read."
1,DISAPPOINTING - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Maybe I've lived too long or read too much, but there was nothing in this book that was new, interesting, surprising, or beyond basic common sense if you're paying the least attention to the world around you. I'm thrilled that I borrowed a copy of this and did not waste my money."
2,"Started at 5 stars, then...","Like being at a nerdy cocktail party playing ""Seven Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" with statistics, but without the cocktails. Great hook with the speculation that legalizing abortion resulted in decreased crime rate, but downhill from there as the comparisons become more labored and tedious. Couldn't bring myself to finish it."
4,Decent,"Good book, interesting read, would recommend, decent shapeMakes you think and gives great information that was clearly thought through"
3,Not really what I was expecting,"This book disappointed me. For all the hype I'd seen before reading it, the book barely met my expectations - not to say it was bad, but just that the high expectations I had, based on other comments, weren't met.Only about two thirds of the pages are the book itself; the remainder - supporting material, including an original interview of Levitt by Dubner - makes up the rest of the book. This in turn led to a bit of a "".. was that it?"" moment at the end of what I thought was a chapter."
2,Superficial cocktail party chatter,"Since everyone was talking about it, I bought and read Freakonomics. Some of the vignettes are interesting, but ultimately all of them end up seeming pretty obvious and trivial. He proves street crack dealers don't make the money, the higher ups do. He shows how teachers cheat on student achievement tests. He goes into excruciating detail about what first names are popular and for how long. The most controversial element is the suggestion that the drop in crime in the early 90s stemmed from Roe v. Wade leading to the abortion of a whole generation of criminals. Unlike the other data-backed trivialities in the book, this bombshell conclusion is based mostly on supposition and opinion, and perhaps wishful thinking, rather than real evidence presented in a compelling way.The book is a cultural phenomenon, but so was the pet rock for awhile. My copy's for sale on Amazon, ""like new."""
1,"over-rated, overhyped, annoying style but some good content","Dont bother with this book. Instead try John Kay's excellent ""Why some countries are rich while others remain poor"" or The Undercover Economist by Tim Harford.This book is a shameless cash-in with no cohernt theme. The worst bit is that the chapters are interspersed with praise for its authors - the kind of qoutes you get on the dust jacket. Bizzare."
2,Clever But Empty,"This was the first book I downloaded to my Kindle. It had been on my wish list for so long that it was turning bituminous. After reading it, I find it hard to remember any of the central tenets. It was interesting as I went for cool psychological/economic experiments, but it was mostly throwaway and the style is done better by Gladwell."
1,All Flash and No Insight,"The book is well presented with great graphics and layout, but once you get past the flamboyance, the book offers little economic insight into the discussed topics. Levitt seems to be living off the fame from his first book, and he should have quit while ahead."
3,"Ok, but not as good as it's been hyped to be","Try reading Tipping Point instead - far better written, insightful and thought provoking"
5,See the world from a different prospective,"I liked this Audio book for three main reasons:-as a foreigner, I can practice my listening & pronunciation skills.-It is a great interesting way to ""read"" a book.-The most important: I am introduced to a different way ofseeing the world. With a lot of critical thinking.I really enjoyed it!"
2,Where's the Beef?,"The tragedy here is that Levitt wasted a potentially great book title, and now nobody can ever call a book ""Freakonomics"" again. If you are an undergrad econ or business student with a few courses under your belt, ""Freakonomics"" will come off as a lightweight book. ""An Economist's View of the World"" by Stephen Rhoads is a much better execution of the same concept; if Freakonomics leaves you wanting more, that would be a good place to go next. It has a LOT more substance than Levitt's book, while remaining mostly accessible to a nontechnical audience. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a very short book by the time you remove all the dead weight and fluff -- I read the whole thing in about three hours."
3,Racist big 'it' heads!,"The overall tone of the book is informative; it has many interesting facts and statistics but the authors made me upset with their racial and prejudice viewpoints they incorporated along with the facts that were presented. Some facts didn't correlate at all, for example, in the 1920s the number of black people murdered by lynching was insignificant compared to the number of black babies that died from an illness( so what does the authors suggest by pairing these two facts together....the lynchings might as well had never happened)?!!! Also, to say that this is a book about economics, most of it is a lot of racially bias prejudice bs attacks against blacks or people living in poverty( so for many black people that is a double wammy in the a**). The title should have been...A Freak in Economics: A Rogue Economist Explores His Hidden ''Prejudice'' Side to Everything! You just have to read it to believe it."
3,Disappointing,"I wasn't impressed with everything in this book. Levitt may have a few important perspectives, but there are other equally good perspectives on many of the topics - and some of the bizarre questions he asked were a bit contrived from the data he distilled. I mean why do drug dealers still live with their moms? Because 90% of them don't take home a lot of money? Duh."
5,Wonderful,Very rarely do you find material as interesting and objective as Levitt and Dubner present in Freakonomics. I've read through Freakonomics multiple times and reference it quite frequently.
3,Give me the Cliff's Notes version,"Of all the books I have ever read, this was certainly one of them."
1,Boring,"Just a book with cause-consequence curiosities about society.It feels like the author is going to make a point or that he is guiding the readers to get somewhere, but, somehow, we never get there.I struggled to finish reading it. It was so disappointing to me, honestly, it was a pure waste of money.At the very best, it's a book to have on your WC. No kidding."
2,"Stained, warped, and ugly.","Although the book quality was labeled as ""good"", the last 112 pages of the book has coffee or tea stains on it and is warped. These pages were stuck together. The label should have been ""fair"", anything other than ""good"" or above. I would not have paid $9 for this book."
2,Ok at best,Decent but the cool title probably has as much or more to do with this books popularity than anything.
5,freakonomics,"This was for my niece for Christmas, it was as promised. Whether she liked it or not is out of my control. =)"
1,A mere conjecture,An irresponsible reprehensible endeavor for cheap profits. The content is baseless; guided by haphazard interpretations and flimsy conclusions devoid of any indepth analysis of a subject. The subject digresses in a boring round about manner. An absolute waste of timeThe authors attempt to answer:What do Schoolteaches and Sumo Wrestlers have in common?. The answers strutters along fails to make any connections between the twoWhere have all the criminals gone?. Their proofs are based on mere conjecture than on a substantiated evidence.I do not recoment this book and intend to return mine.
3,"Silly Liberal atheistic thought or""brilliant"" economics?","Silly Liberal atheistic thought disguised as ""brilliant"" economics.""Pool of potential crime does begin to shriek because of Roe vs. Wade. Abortion helps to prevent crime. How wonderful. The authors define economics as the study of incentives How the world works. True incentive produces change and I admit the authors are very sharp. But this work seems to suggest dignity human life and culture mean nothing. There is no such thing as honor and goodness only incentive and cleaver traps for the common man invented in think tanks. Who cares if a drug dealer lives with his mother. There is no morality only how people tick and how they can be manipulated.Despite my moralistic attack on this book. I have to admit it is interesting. But I can't stand the bizarre anti- morality position books like these see to take."
3,Freaky- I think not,"I bought this book solely based on the title because as a middle aged, dumpy dude, I wanted to learn how to get my freak on. I couldn't get past the first chapter of this snoozer. If it's that hard to get your freak on, forget it."
2,what a suprise that now everything is open,"the book itself has nothing to explore, only the title is so charming that`s why i ordered this book, i heard some of the things that rogue!! ecenomist mentioned on this book many years ago."
1,Un pesimo libro.,"El autor de este libro no tiene ningún tipo de fudamento para haberlo escrito. Explora hechos sin algun sentido relacionandolos con otros que tienen menos sentido aún.Obviamente uno puede relacionar la muerte de una hormiga verde en el amazonas con las enfermedades de las focas rosadas de la antartida, pero que sentido tiene hacer todo un libro acerca de ello?La segunda parte de este libro podría establecer la relacion entre como la publicidad y el mercadeo puede llegar a hacer un libro un best-seller."
1,What's wrong with the uneven pages?,My book's pages are all rugged looking. The pages are not smoothed out so all the edges of the pages are all messed up looking. I am not very happy about this. It is too much of a hassle to contact the seller and let him know about the problem because then I would have to pay for shipping and wait another I don't know how long. Why can't they just do it right the first time? I purchased it new so I expected a new book not being defected.
2,Too simple explanations for complex fenomena,"The authors face complex fenomena from a classical point of view, providing convincing -though poooly based- explanations. Dissapointing."
3,save your money,I'm glad that I took this book out of the library for free. It wasn't all that it was hyped up to be!
2,Why is this a best seller?,"The book started of quite ok, but as you go you will notice that the author did not have much stuff to write - more like one of my students who try to fill up pages. Check out from Pg.193 to Pg.203. I wonder what criteria they used to state this as a NY Times bestseller."
2,author admits fabrications,"The author has admitted, in print, that he has fabricated data and intentionally misrepresented statistics - especially in the abortion chapter. He justifies it by saying his intentions were good. He admitted this in an interview with Gene Epstein in the book ""Econospinning."""
2,For Critical Readers Only,"I give this book a negative review mostly because of another reviewer's title statement: ""Smarter for having read it""; the book consistently criticizes experts in various media, and then proceeds to engender the deplorable ""expert"" mentality in casual readers, like us, who are really not good judges of what's going on. There is so much at stake in their claims, which they hasten through, that to consider yourself more learned after the fact may be only the process of self-blinding. Dubner and Levitt aren't necessarily wrong, but to read them without severe skepticism is to throw your mind into a vast pool of questionable correlations and grossly vague statistics, where some people may never escape their own illusory intelligence and sophistication."
2,Waste of Money,"I read Freakanomics back when it first came out. I fell for the hype generated by its release and was sorely disappointed. If you want to read it, borrow it from someone. It is certainly not worth your money to buy it."
2,freakoff,"A combo puff piece (25x we're told how great the economist is) filler -- each chapter begins with enough padding to enable anybody to withstand Mike Tyson at his peak - and a bit of a clever idea.This is really a magazine article (in fact, it was) sold expensively. The most brilliant idea was packaging a few insights this way."
3,Hard Slog,"The amount of stats related to American Baseball makes this a hard read for those not intpo Baseball statistics. The stats are the basis of the story line set up, but, it just goes on. The actual stats arent that imp[ortant as such, however, if you havenet got a clue what they are stats for, it is difficult to get past them to get into the book proper like. Avergae and just interesting."
3,library used book,Got this library used book. i got the book pretty fast. overall the quality worth my payment for this book.
3,Nice at the begining tiresome at the end,"Fun story, catchy examples and a gigantic boring end story about parenting or witch name should you give your child (or something like that, I could not read until the end). I think the idea was excellent and then someone though ""I must make this a big book"", then it all plummeted.Honestly, its worth its price even if your`re bored by the end (like me)."
2,"The more I read, the more I got turned off",The whole chapter on speculation that crime went up in the 1990's because women couldn't have abortions and therefore their offspring became criminals?! Then they tried to rationalize it was scientific? Maybe I overreacted but I started doubting every argument they presented. Put the book down half way through it.
4,Interesting but why the hype,"This is an interesting book which uses fairly common statistical and economic methods to address social phenomena. The results of Levitt's studies are interesting and often challenge some common assumptions. Levitt also proposes interesting and bold theories based on the results of his studies (abortion and lower crime). While the book is worth reading and fun, I don't understand why Levitt's work is considered so innovative. Basically he is an economist practicing sociology. The book is similar in many ways to Barry Glasser's book The Culture of Fear-Why Americans Fear the Wrong Things(also recommended) which also uses social science to test and challenge common assumptions about our social world. Perhaps the attention is because he is that rare economist who actually writes well and on topics of interest to non-economists."
2,no numbered notes - hard to validate claims,"while the subject matter of the book was interesting -and there are plenty enough reviews here without me adding to/detracting from that- my comment is a fundamental problem with the publishing/printing of the book: there are numbered notes of sources of the various claims made at the back of the book, but the text in the chapters of the book HAS NO REFERENCE NUMBERS. so, basically, you have no way of validating the claims unless you dig around the notes at the end of the book hoping to cross-reference the parts you're currently reading. every other non-fiction book i've read numbers their notes; why doesn't this book? steven d. levitt would ask to think about this, and maybe, just maybe, it's because some of his claims are tenuous at best. or maybe i just got a badly printed/published book. for the record, it was the hardback edition, published 2005."
3,I liked the cover,I expected much more surprising statistics. They focus a lot on a few topics like how legalized abortion resulted in a massive drop in crime. The book is kind of interesting but not worth being a bestseller in my opinion. Cool cover though! ;-) The last third of this book is filled with lists of boy's and girl's names. It seems they desperately had to present more than 200 pages to their publishing company. I wouldn't buy the book but it's worth borrowing.
3,It is what it is,"A light, moderately entertaining read that provides several good anecdotes for future banter. Helluva lot better than its contemporary, ""Blink"", for the fact that there is some legitimate scholarship underlying the stories told within (apparently excepting the crime rate/abortion discussion). The cover and early print media reviews hype the book so much that expectations may have been out of line; but if you ordinarily listen to talk radio on the drive into work, consider this book on CD as a slightly more enriching alternative."
3,I expected more,"""Freakonomic"" was an interesting read, but somehow I was expecting more than what it delivered. Though the individual sections were interesting, I was disappointed that there wasn't an overall theme."
3,Why did crime REALLY drop in NYC in the 1990's,"Read the first chapter of this book and the first half of Tipping Point, and you will still not know. Levitt claims it was increased abortions in low income families 20 years earlier. The other book claims it was simply a plan to remove grafitti from the subways. I always had heard that it was simply a result of the improved economy during the 90's, a 'myth' that both these books dispell with further myths. I am confused."
2,Prep for Trivia,"A fun read. Not much more. More a proof that you can disprove . . . or prove . . . anything. Not really about economics, and by the author's own admission, not much of anything else either.Charles Schwahn, Life-Long LearnerI love the amazon service."
2,Not great ... Get a better description of Economics in Aiden Rocke's Rogue Threat,"I was just disappointed in this book. Having recently read Rogue Threat by Aiden Rocke, I felt that Levitt could have taken this book in the direction Rocke does. Rostow's five stages of economic growth explain, for me anyway, how we got to where we are today. The sixth stage, secular spiritual stagnation, is much of what Levitt talks about. Rocke demonstrates in a fascinating story, Rogue Threat, that a seventh stage, a new enlightenment, is possible. Go to rougethreatonline, you'll learn as much there as you will reading Levitt."
1,Way over-hyped,"I suppose it was an interesting magazine article, so they added a lot of verbiage and managed to get a book out of it. Save your money."
1,A Lot of Hype Sells Books,"After reading all the reviews I was excited to receive my copy of Freak-o-nomics, which is afterall, nothing about nothing. Talk about weak science and making something out of nothings. Save your money. It is a thin overhyped book about nothing and you will learn nothing new."
3,"Rogue book, that's for sure.","To be fair the authors forewarned that the book follows no particular logic. So goes Freakonomics with its strange twists and turns. Other books have been written about the exact same subject matter (if you've read the The Tipping Point, which predates Freakonomics, you'll see exactly what I mean). Stuff like the cause of the sudden drop in crime in the 90s attributed to legalized abortion is found in both books. Yet, at least in The Tipping Point Gladwell attempts to make sense of it all by elaborating a formula of a word of mouth epidemic. In Freakonomics however, the authors simply want to write about the interesting aspect of such phenomenons. Each chapter makes a great article; a fairly decent book."
4,Provocative...,"Read this just for the fun you'll have explaining to your unsuspecting friends who have no idea you studied Economics (and you haven't, you just read this book) that crime surges may depend on abortion rights...Look at the data, please!There's more here that will get you thinking and thats always a good thing, right?Statistics can be very boring but applying numbers to measurable events and then asking the right questions makes all the difference.Levitt knows his fundamentals and Dubner helps him transmit this coherently.Provocative answers, enjoyable read..."
4,Simply amazing,I seems to me a very well writen book and it gave me very good knowledge on many things I was not aware of.
4,"Interesting, but many things still hidden","OK, the book doesn't provide the bidden side of everything, but it is truly an interesting read on the topics that it covers. I would argue that the author is an engaged statistician, not a rogue economist. In any event, it's a fun insight into a few current trends, and hypotheses about what causes them."
3,fun ideas but a too-chatty style,"The idea of applying economic and econometric thinking to social problems is really neat and profound. The author has actually done this (papers in the notes to chapters). Unfortunately, the style of this book is painfully breezy and chatty, the sort of ""don't be intimidated by all this"" prose that seems intended not to put off the general reader, but which is condescending and uninformative. Readers who self-select to read this book deserve more information, less chat. Regardless, worth a read for the ideas."
2,The Title was the Best Part,"Or maybe the publicity hype was the best part. Yes, the book is readable, and it is unique to find economic principles applied to everyday situations. But too often I found myself saying, ""Ho,hum. So what? Am I done with this chapter yet?"""
2,Freak-o-tistics,"This surely is not the Economics that I grew up with. This easy to read book draws some fascinating conclusions, many of which have been discussed in other reviews. However, I'm not sure that this is Economics at all. By my dictionary, Economics is defined as ""the science of the production, distribution, and consumption of comodities."" (Concise American Heritage Dictionary). Other than oblique references as to how to get ahead in a crack ring, this is not touched on at all.This book is about the use of statistics, plain and simple. Statistics can be molded to derive most any conclusion. Levitt makes interesting use of statistics to come up with unusual conclusions. But this is not Economics. All that Levitt is advocating is for us to think outside the box and see beyond our foregone conclusions. This is a valuable lesson, but certainly nothing new.I can see why this is a best seller - it is very simple to read and it is very clever. But that is all. Nothing more."
5,Thought Provoking!,"I found the discussion of the topics in this book to be riveting! Most interesting is the story of the college student doing research on the crack dealers... amazing! Although I read it months ago, I continue to think about the perspectives in this book. A great read!"
3,"Interesting, but Unfulfilling","For all the hype, I felt this book fell flat. Yeah there is some interesting information in this book. The Author is very unusual in his type of data sets. All this may be true, but a lot of it turned out to be useless data.Why do I care what names are used by different social classes.I did find the part about crack dealers and the high archy of their business system very interesting. That part in itself made it work my time, but I wouldn't read it again!"
4,My two cents,"This collection is the perfect introduction to ""thinking outside the box"" that Young Adults so desperately need. Filled with challenging situations that demand to know, ""why things are the way they are?"" Sprinkled with just enough statistics to give credibility, (but not to overwhelm), and just enough history to shed light on the bigger picture; it asks the meaningful, fresh questions that will intrigue and interest the most lethargic student. Recommended for thoughtful, mature audiences, this book may appeal to the Young Adult reader, and their parents. Drugs, crime, getting a job - this book covers many of the contemporary issues facing Young Adults today."
4,entertaining and thought provoking book,"The book was very entertaining and thought provoking. I don't know if I believe everything he said, but he certainly makes me think more creatively on what causes things to happen and why some of what we think causes an event are just indicators of the actual cause. It's great to see his perspective. I didn't feel like he was forcing his views on me unlike what other people are saying."
5,Outside the box,"For those of you who prefer books that lead one to think along very traditional path lines, this is not the book for you.It is, however, an insightful, easily read book that asks tons of what if questions and comes up with suprising answers. Imagine being able to prove teachers were cheating on standardized tests for their students. Imagine that a decrease in crime rate is directly related to legalized abortion. Imagine that what you name your child has a direct impact on future social status. It's all in here and that barely scratches the surface. Learn how to wheel and deal on a home, based on what the real estate agent's ad did or did not say. Or how about learning about the economy of dealing drugs?While I do not agree per se with everything the authors say, I found this book to be a facinating and compelling read that really helped me to get out of my box and think about the world a little differently and that alone is priceless."
4,Fascinating Read,This book was fascinating to me cool little details and facts that affect our everyday lives. I had been stuck reading fiction so this was my first non-fiction book in years and I am so glad I read it!
4,"Good Read, with some salt",This was an interesting read for me and makes you look at ordinary day things/events in a different light. I would have to say that you should take some of this information with a grain of salt because some correlations were a little stretched. Overall really good though.
4,Would Recommend,"Overall, I found the book very entertaining. It won't teach you much about economics, but it will get you thinking and perhaps questioning. If nothing else, it will certainly open your eyes to some new, interesting ideas.Unfortunately, I felt the ending was quite poor. I am primarily referring to the chapter of lists of names and who names who what. It was repetitive, largely uninteresting, and not nearly as thought-provoking or useful as the rest of the book.In the end, I would definitely recommend the book."
4,Economics like never before,"I find it hard to categorize it as an economics book. This is part trivia, part statistics and part folklore. The book does bring out some very interesting interconnections that is interesting as well as intriguing. The connection between abortion and fall in crime rates is one such aspect. Also Levitt brings out findings regarding online dating websites and concluded that bald men and overweight women fared badly. To me that is kind of self evident.This book is a lively read, but some of the conclusions seems pretty obvious."
1,I Was Not Dazzled,"So much for Malcolm Gladwell's (Blink) opinion. I didn't notice his blurb on the cover until later. If he likes it, you know that's an omen.For someone in economics, the author(s) don't bother to show much proof. Like we're supposed to believe drug dealers have a board of directors, and a regulated payroll? And abortion caused the crime rate to drop? A ""well-maintained"" house is just old? And what was with ALL the names of the babies? Who cares? I didn't even see Velveeta, Asti Spumante (yes, real names!), or the ever popular ""Shaniqua"" on the lists.Mostly unsubstantiated conjecture (sociologist they know ""swears"" he met the twins LemonJello and OrangeJello in a store), this book just goes all over the place and ends up nowhere."
1,Freakonomics,"It is a complete mystery how the author of Blink could recommend this (on the cover). Blink had a central unifying theme that was well-presented and provocative,carefully outlined and argued. This book is a hodgepodge of random ""wisdom"" that uses a few statistics or economic data and then generalizes in a vague way that seems to imply that the ""ideas"" (stretching the term) they present are meaningful or interesting. It seems like trivial pursuit for economics and once again reinforces my low opinion of academic economics. Really an insultingly stupid book. It is discouraging to have such superficial analysis of real social problems get such a popular reaction. Good for non-thinkers."
1,horrible to read,Unfortunately the book covers several totally unrelated topics in each chapter without separating them in any way. The author has never heard of paragraphs nor any other layouting techniques.
2,Great Disappointment,"Perhaps the book has been hyped too much. I found the book scattered, and the ""insights"" trivial. More like written by a college grad who tries to show off his cleverness, than by a thoughtful economist. I don't think this book discredits Levitt as a serious economist, on the contrary, he maximized his own economic return by appealing to the low common denominator.Hope Levitt made enough money from this book that he can afford to devote the rest of his life to serious scientific inquiries."
2,The Audience is cheated,"To me the book was very disappointing. The book is projected as something that explores the hidden side of everything, but it actually just proves to you what you already knew through facts and figures.If you are buying this book to read about some interesting co-relations, you will end up finding stuff that you already knew of. Both a Hollywood aspirant and a Drug Pedlar hope to rule their domain someday. Wow!!! Now did I not know this before?To the intellectual reader I would strongly suggest to refrain from buying this book."
4,Great cocktail party trivia but hard to pull out universal truths,"A very quick read full of lots of fun facts and studies. The only downside? Hard to figure out how I would apply most of this to business and personal situations. The one over-arching truth that emerges: it makes sense to keep an open mind about everything, because you can't always trust what you hear."
4,"interesting, but not rocket science","Unlike a lot of economics books this book is pretty fair and unbiased. I don't think it is as funny as some readers thought, but the subjects are interesting. The economic theory in the book is common sense. For example, teachers cheat to make their students look smarter on standardized tests and real estate agents won't necessarily being doing everything they can to help you. However, the way he proves these things is pretty interesting. This book really reads a lot like a John's Bathroom reader. It has very interesting stories, but they are not going to make you any smarter."
4,Seeing the world through statistics,"I like this book. It shows the power of economic and statistical thinking. As they show in the book, it often leads to surprising conclusions. But they go where the data takes them, not where they want it to go."
4,mme,"Intersting, many new concepts and ideas. Maybe a bit too ""USA-specific"" for a stupid european I am."
5,Mind Opening,"There is always ""cause and effect"" in everything in life. But most of the time we get it wrong. We are always too easily satisfied with our own shallowness, or blinded by our preconception. Read this book. Dig deeper. Take another persepctive. You will feel the difference. Truth is always there and truht cannot be changed because it maybe ""politically incorrect""."
3,"Very Entertaining, Not Much Substance","Freakonomics is a very entertaining and humorous look at, basically, random statistics. The book is not particularly enlightening, but, nevertheless, I could hardly put it down: I finished it in a single day. I recommend the book for its unique perspective and entertaining nature, but don't take this one too seriously."
4,Very insightful,"Levitt and Dubner do a great job of looking at numerous issues from a new perspective. The abortion crime link is really interesting. The book is in stark contrast to Malcolm Gladwell's work which is basically a 3 page article turned into a book. This work seems like a lot of research boiled down into a short book.The NY crime analysis is the best example of this, Gladwell treats the story as a gotcha story which has one simple explanation which was waiting for him to discover (or Rudy Guliani as it were). Levitt and Dubner attempted to look at the issue with real data and thoughtful analysis.The presentation and analysis throughout the book is in depth (if incomprehensible to a novice such as myself) and as transparent as can be in such a short book.The only negative I have is in relation to their follow up, Superfreakanomics. The sequel is everything the original is not and could easily have been the work of Gladwell himself."
4,Economics in a new and wacky light!,"This is definately not your average econ 101 text book. In fact it's a highly entertaining read that can be easily picked and put down. I liked the way that authors applied their research to everyday scenarios and made thought provoking conclusions. The subject matter definately comes in handy when it comes to discussing mortgages, parenting and crime rates!"
5,Very interesting,"From every day life issues, the author depicts in an interesting and scientific fashion how ordinary people behave.It also shows how simple secure and intelligent strategies can change the course of action of discriminatory groups."
5,Freakishly Good Book Especially for Non-numbers Crunchers,"I'm not a quant jock - the kind of person who looks at the world through a spreadsheet. However, Freakonomics sheds light on some compelling topics, and backs up their points with equally compelling data.Do sumo wrestlers and public school teachers cheat? Read the book and find out.This is a gripping read, cover to cover. Well written, and well edited. This is a book you keep on your ""favorites"" shelf in the bookcase, and a book you buy for close friends and good business acquaintances.It's also great fodder for water cooler talk or at a cocktail party.They have a great blog, too, so you can always see what the authors are working on."
5,A must read!,"This is a great book! The kind that you just don't want to put down, and cant stop talking about once you have finished the last page. Brilliant!!!"
4,Interesting book,"Lots of fascinating ideas in the book. Not everything in here is 100% convincing, but I highly recommend reading it, especially with a critical mind."
4,Economics made interesting,"This book really made economics fascinating by talking about the following areas:How drug gangs are run like a corporation with layers of hierarchy, territory,franchises, and even a ""board of directors"".Why the crime rate dropped dramatically 16 years after abortion was legalized.Why teachers would cheat on tests for their students.And much,much more.It makes you think about things you would have never thought about before from and economists view point.Great reading."
5,Fascinating amazing bizarre and wonderful,"This book if full of fascinating examples of how intelligent economics can be applied to obscure, bizarre, amazing situations. Giving a lot of mind blowing conclusions etc. A really interesting book that is difficult to put down.Our daily newspapers chronicle the failures of economics, this book chronicles it successes.The authors are compassionate fascinating and fun. Really it's a mind boggling roller coaster and a fun packed ride. Get on!"
4,Entertaining,"I read this book about 3 years ago and came across it again when unpacking a box. I decided to re-read the book. This book is very entertaining. If you are looking for a deep content driven book on economics and theories, look elsewhere. There are a lot of non-sequitar fallacies in this book. Example, Bob likes cats and is a Giants fan. Therefore, all people who like cats are Giants fans. The book is more of an entertainment read. The authors are two highly touted, award-winning economists who reach certain theories based on non-traditional thinking and not empirical data. Read with an open mind and you will enjoy."
2,Way Overrated,"While this book has some interesting bits, it certainly does not explore ""The Hidden Side of Everything"". What it does do is compile a number of different, unconnected essays about certain trends in society--some of which are very interesting and some of which are fairly obvious. The essays are split into chapters, each of which is preceeded by a blurb about how great one of the authors (Levitt) is, which is very annoying (it almost seems as though the authors are trying to convince you that the book is great by repeatedly telling you that Levitt is Brilliant). The book is also very, very short. I finished it in about three hours. These essays would be more appropriate in a weekend newspaper series rather than in book form.If you want to read a book about how the world currently works--both in macro and micro form--and where it's going, I suggest The World is Flat. That book is engaging from page one, absolutely fascinating and totally relevant for anyone."
3,Good theme but uncritical,"I like the theme of 'Freakonomics': 'Be more skeptical of the conventional wisdom, & ask more questions.' I also find the book entertaining, & to some degree, reminds me of Jerry Seinfeld's wit & humour.But disappointingly, 'Freakonomics' is uncritical about its own theme. Various analysis tend to be based on oversimplified assumptions (e.g. test scores represents intelligence), & interpretaion of the analysis tend to lack objectivism (e.g. abortion is key factor for decrease in crime)."
3,"Amusing, but . . .","An amusing, often provocative book, with some ironic lapses in reasoning.The philosophical distinction between a correlation and a causal relationship is, as the British say, a sticky wicket. Levitt rightly mocks those who unthinkingly elevate correlations into causal relationships, but then he discovers other correlations (all that statistics can do) and anoints them causal relationships. A correlation by any other name . . .At one point, he expresses disbelief that anyone could think that a 2% change in the rate of unemployment could begin to explain a 40% drop in crime. Sounds pretty preposterous, doesn't it? Unfortunately for Levitt's argument, a 2% change in the rate of unemployment, from say 6% to 4%, is actually a 33% drop in unemployment. As the illustration on the cover suggests, if you cut into an apple, you may find an orange.Still, with some appropriate skepticism, it's an entertaining read."
5,See the world through new eyes,"I just finished the book today and I loved it. It was honest and seldomly are books so honest and refreshing all at the same time. The book is interesting and reads very nicely. There is no esoteric language, no confusing theories... it was very clear and entertaining at the same time. I had no idea economics could be this fun. Excellent! I loved it."
5,I want more!,"I received this book as a birthday present and I wasn't quite sure how I would take it. After reading the first chapter I was intrigued and could not put the book down. Levitt's studies should be brought to the college, maybe high school level, as the topics generate substantial conversation pieces that can be used for more explanation and research.Although I could tend to agree that I would have enjoyed learning more substance for each topic (chapter) of the book, it was early explained that there was no unifying or underlying theme to the book. I have gained a lot from the book and hope to see more like it in the future. Great read!"
4,Freakonomics Not Just Economics,"This is an excellent book that brought out many perspectives on subjects that I thought I had made up my mind about years ago. I have had my eyes opened on many subjects covered in this book, and I have recommended it to all of my e-mail contacts and personal friends."
5,EXCELLENT: Interesting and easy to read,"I don't think there is any one thing about this book that I would normally think was interesting to me. But yet I found it was awesome. That may be the sign of a great book: make something people don't normally care about interesting.If you're a liberal, conservative, or moderate, you will find some fact or finding in this book disturbing. You will also find something to reinforce your belief. Hopefully, at the very least, everyone will take from it and challenge their own assumptions at times."
3,"Interesting, But No Need For An Entire Book!","I purchased this book with high hopes. I wanted to read something light and fun, but most importantly, interesting. The book was definitely interesting, but I'm not sure we need a whole book for it. The article that Dubner wrote would be just fine.I found the first three chapters interesting enough, long, but interesting. It was around the fourth chapter that I decided this didn't really need to be an entire book. It started getting boring. It was the same comparisons and stats over and over again, just using different topics. I think the authors tried to ""fill"" the book too much. There was a lot of detail that wasn't actually needed.So, I gave the book 3 stars. If you want to learn about economics outside the box, sure enough this will do. If you are looking for entertainment. Maybe skip around and pick the chapters you might be interested in. Good luck!"
3,Freakingokatbest...,"Look, I'll get straight to the point in my take on ""Freakonomics."" Many friends ranted and raved about how wonderful this book is. ""Excellent read"" and ""genius"" were common descriptions. I have recently began to study a bit more in depth about economics and on a whim decided to toss this on the Kindle and give it a go. While I'm glad I did--it was a very quick read--for the entertainment of some of the comparisons, there was nothing really notable about the book. It was pretty cool to see how these brilliant men were able to relate things that most people wouldn't think to compare, it was pointless.If I'd spent more time reading the book, I may be tempted to ask my friends who recommended this for some time back. As it is, it's a quick read, it has some entertainment value, but from my perspective is severely overrated."
5,On Freakonomics...,"Economics is not always one of the most interesting and enjoyable subject matters around. However, Freakonomics dispels that notion and brings lots of enjoyable quality to the subject. Whether you agree with his points or not, this book will make you think and want to analyze the supposed ""conventional"" wisdom of our society and how we function.A lot of the points in the book make complete sense, but it's not as if an agenda is being pushed on you. It forces you to think about the issues that he presents and challenges you to think: Do you buy this? He presents interesting issues that are controversial and his writing opens up debate and questioning to econ nuts and non-economists alike.I really enjoyed the book and couldn't put it down. I give it 5/5 because it is one of the more interesting books I've read and Levitt writes as if he's in a conversation with you by offering unique perspectives on topics we have already sort of formulated a generic and typical response too...5/5"
4,Most interesting!,"It isnt that this book has any real point to it, its simply that the topics it covers and the way it covers them are extremely interesting. From how a gang makes money to internet dating to baby names. It gives you a lot of fun things to talk about with friends and a lot of deeper issues to think about. A fun, quick read!!"
3,Datamining at work,"Freakonomics is offering an insight in datamining possibilities without bothering the reader too much with the underlying statistical methods. This is both a strength and a weakness. Outcomes may surprise you, but are not always convincing. Books like this appeal to 'unnumberacy', comparable to illiteracy,a topic dealing with riddles, paradoxes and counterintuitive matters of the same kind. For me the 'teacher's guide' with an in-depth covering of the statistical methods would be more interesting"
4,Not bad at all -- worth buying,I enjoyed the knowledge imparted in this book. It taught me how things in the economy are not quite what they seem. Learning how to be more critical can't be bad.Levitt is a little pedantic in his writing but that doesn't detract from the book. I recommend it to anyone who wants an inside look at what goes on behind the scenes.
3,Not Nearly the Most Interesting Economics Book Around,"This book is more about Steven Levitt's statistical analyses of sociological issues than it is about economic ideas. His results are moderately interesting. But his book does not deserve to be the number one selling ""economics"" book today. There are much better, much more thought-provoking ""economics of everyday life"" books out there such as Steven Friedman's ""Hidden Order"" or especially Bruce Madariaga's ""Economics for Life"". Try one of these paperbacks instead."
4,Neat Book,This is an interesting book about many topics. The best thing about the title is the language that it is written. I think anyone can follow the author on this read.
4,good job is done,very beautiful book. i dont agree with someone who underestimate this book. The author is great
4,Feakonomics Review,"What do a teacher and a sumo wretler have in common? How can a real estate agent possibly relate to the KKK? These are both are questions regarding how certain factors relate to one another in the real world. Who would have known that both sumo wresters and teachers cheat in a similar way in order to increase their pay, and real estate agents and the KKK use tricks to try and fool people to do whatever they want. Can it be true that a persons name determines what social class they belong to? or what contributes to a childs character in the future? Can it be the school he's going to or the friends he has? Freakonomics is unraveling the hidden side of just about everything."
3,Redundance,Attempts to prove that socio-economic status is much more a hindrance to advancement than race.
2,Disappointing,"Based on all of the hype and that this book is still on the best seller's list, I was disappointed. I expected much more. It's not a big book and is very easy to read. Some of the facts are interesting but I just couldn't get into it."
3,It was ok,"I received this book as a Christmas gift. Glad I didn't have to pay for it. While it was slightly entertaining, some of the authors connections didn't seem to make sense. I did get the feeling that the author believes he is the smartest guy in the room. Its not often that you see a book that has glowing reviews about the author at the beginning of each chapter.If you can borrow it from the library or a friend, great. If not, wait till it hits the discount rack. It was ok, but I do not understand how this book was given such great reviews."
5,Good Reading Ahead,I enjoyed this book. It really makes you consider all the factors that contribute to modern society. I highly recommend for anyone who likes to challenge their preconceived notions.
2,Audiobook loses one star for production,"Far from being an in-depth book on economics, this is a 10,000-foot view - that is, the book is imminently skimmable. Levitt offers some interesting ideas, but nothing ground-shaking and with little real supporting evidence...thus, he and Dubner seem to have padded it with a lot of needless speculation and rumination. Levitt is a smart guy (as the reader or listener is reminded, over and over), but the book is academically lazy.The problem is that the audiobook doesn't allow the listener to skip over the unnecessary bits (like the 30-minute hagiographic intro by Dubner - if you get the audiobook, you can bypass the first five tracks. Spoiler alert: It says Levitt's a genius!)With a bit more effort and a lot more editing, this could have been a splendid book...as it is, it's kind of like the ""Chicken Soup For The Soul"" of economics. A lot of nifty anecdotes, but not a lot of real information."
3,Just Okay,For anyone who is not into numbers it might seem an interesting book. It goes into the cases on a very superficial way. The most interesting thing I found on this book was how deeply related are the incentives to the results.
4,It was just OK,"I read Freakonomics, based on the high reviews that Malcolm Gladwell and other reviewers had given it. However, I was extremely dissapointed. Basically, I was annoyed that it didn't go over more topics. I was also dismayed to see how little the topics had to do with my life. There were some of them that were ok, such as the Cheating Teachers, but I was really dissappointed in the vast majority of the topics discussed."
2,Useless,Perhaps I am doing something wrong with the font size. The bolded words mentioned in the text are not bold on the Kindle. The tables do not work in the Kindle format.Can I get my money back?
3,Great concept but not great read,There has been a lot of hype about this book. I found it readable and the topic was interesting.As the author says there is no unifying theme which is probably responsible for me finding it a bit of a chore to read and it took me longer to read this book then I normal.
4,A vital subject made fun and interesting.,"Freakonomics is a well presented examination of how economics can be used to explore social issues. Freakonomics rightly shows that economics is the study of human decisions (and not, as some claim, the study of how to balance one's checkbook whilst oppressing the poor.) The authors address social questions in ways that some will find blasphemous.Opponents of Economics instruction in public schools are notorious for using dubious ""facts"" to advocate policies which redirect resources away from those who've shown they can use them to maximum public advantage and toward those who've shown they will squander them. Freakonomics exposes their slight of hand. You may not agree with every implication of Freakonomics but you will respect the rigorous analysis with which the authors attack their subjects. Once you've enjoyed your copy, leave it in a coffee shop near the local State University. You just might help an idealistic young person achieve great things."
2,ouch,"I'm sorry, I only read the first 50 pgs. and well, I'm a writer myself, so I just couldn't get over how poorly written this book was! His grammar is alright, sure, but his use of adjectives lies below 0. Pitiful. Sorry, but this book just didn't make me want to go past pg. 50.."
2,Mostly A Disappointment,"I was disappointed in this book. I bought it after reading a very positive review in the Wall Street Journal. I am always interested in anything that explains how things really work as opposed to the conventional wisdom put forth on most topics that is usually nothing more than some pundit's ill-thought out opinion. For anyone with a strong background in analyzing data either in manufacturing, R&D, accounting, etc., and who has had their share of surprises over many years when the `obvious' answer turned out to be dead wrong, this book will not be much of a revelation. The profanity, although modest in quantity, and presented as quotes, was unnecessary in a work with nominal scholarly aspirations. Unless you are very young or have no background in solving problems by generating and using data, this book is likely not worth your time or money."
1,SuperFraudonomics,"The attempts to censor reviews of the new book Superfreakonomics have been explained. On the way to the printing press, the authors' anti-global warming data was debunked. ""Global Cooling"" is a myth based on a lie the authors tried to rush into the public disinformation machine. And Amazon helped them."
1,Freakonomics : A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,"And here it is, another one: I had received this book, (and is not the first time), with the paper cut as with and hand saw.Why are you doing such things? Overseas?"
2,You Eat Like This,"Steven Levitt returns, this time with a book about the discipline of getting freaky, aka, freakonomics. I wish that Steve Levitt had had a chance to consult with the late, great Rick James regarding the subject matter of this book. I believe Rick James knew a thing or two about getting freaky...just give the guy a bag of coke and he was ready to PAR-TAY.Many of Levitt's assertions fall flat. In fact, one might say that they fall Levitt. Because one look at him and its obvious; the guy doesn't know the FIRST THING about getting freaky..."
2,Common Sense - Somehow Hugely Popular Book,"I was unimpressed by Freakonomics - not because it doesn't make some good points, but because anyone who ever took a statistics class and has the ability to question conventional wisdom has no need to read it. Yes, it's irrational to be afraid of your child being shot by a gun in your home when you have a swimming pool in the back yard. Yes, it's not comfortable to think that the rise in abortions has caused a lowering of the overall crime rate. But the numbers are not moral - they're just numbers. If you have never investigated these types of ideas, then start with Freakonomics, but I would also urge you to read a level one statistics and economics text, and also read the book ""SuperCrunchers"", which covers similar gound."
2,"Vanity, of sorts..","all this book is a collections of few examples each unrelated to other and theory by the author which he proves by using statistical methods. Which is not bad except the problems being discussed are social in nature or very subjective. I am not convinced any form of statistical analysis can actually prove such things with certainty. Thought provoking ? not for me as the authors seemed more eager to prove how there theory is so right and how they are so different in there thinking. It does seem more like vanity book than anything. more to it, the bonus material explains in details in full length how ""different and brilliant"" one of the author is. That is not the reason i want to read the book."
5,Gymnastics For the Mind: Viewing from a Different Angle,"This book was so well written that I couldn't put it down. One chapter ended with a ""tickler"" and led logically to the next. Most importantly it invited the reader to consider a broader range of factors that may, or may not, have led to events. Certainly the juxtaposition of materials, previously not considered related, gives one pause.Being open to the points made creates a kind of gymnastics of the mind that is refreshing at any age. Also, I learned some new facts and quotes.Loved the hardback from the library but had to buy a copy for myself."
4,Interesting,"I think this book poses a lot of interesting theories and it is well written. It's somewhat surprising to see economists who can write so well for the general public.My only complaint was that it was too short! I look forward to reading the next one.However, if you're not ready to read some controversial and possibly shocking interpretation of data, I wouldn't suggest reading this. I think a lot of people disliked this book for the political connotations of the theory the writers proposed, without stopping to think if the data might actually support them."
3,Ok but SLOW read...,I read this book after reading blink and tipping point by gladwell. (saw he had a blurb on the cover) Maybe its becasue I read it right after but I didnt find it too terribly thought provoking. I liked what he had to say for the most part but found that I trudged through the book. Almost put it down a few times. I normally read at a decent pace. I think this book took almost 2 weeks to choke down. Alright.
3,Great Primer in Microeconomics,"Microeconomics brought down to a ""See Spot Run"" level. The author uses such diverse data as crime rates, baby names, and fixing Sumo wrestling matches to show how small things can effect larger things.I would recommend reading it before taking a more traditional read dry) microeconomics or statistics course."
2,"""I don't want to write a book ...""","... Levitt quotes himself (!) as saying, ""unless maybe Dubner and I could do it together."" The result is a strange and ugly collaboration. There are a few interesting ideas (few because it's short and very leisurely paced), but they are not so much argued as revealed, interlarded with comments (by Dubner, one hopes) about how brilliant Levitt is.It's tedious, but more important, it subverts the theme of the book. Over and over they tell us not to believe experts, to think for ourselves, to look at the data. But the presentation is so superficial and the data so thin that no reader could reach the same conclusions thinking for herself. Instead, we just have one more expert telling us the others are wrong. How fresh and radical is that?"
1,pop economics lacking sound basis,"Read the reviews before buying book. Buy book if you like pop economics. The book is full of statistics that support the ""story line"" of Levitt in Dubner speak. Every statistic supports the flow. There is attempt to show cross correlation and distinguish between causal effect and correlation. If this book is to be taken seriously more attention needs to be paid to the soundness of the analysis. ""Similar to TV ads reporting that 4/5 doctors recommend that..."" Pop, goes the cash register. Statistical analysis requires sound statistical design of experiments and reporting of significance of variables studied and not studied. Not a serious report but apparently highly lucrative by the number of weeks on the best seller list. Won't stand the test of time. Or economic revew."
1,"I was very ""Underwhelmed""","I was really ecited when this book first came out becasue I am trained as an Economist and thought this would get others excited about the ways that theory can explain reality. What a dissapointment. The author might just be the most egomanical man that has ever lived and, I might be able to deal with that had the book been even semi-revolutionary, but it definately is not. Each chapter begins with Dubner kiss Levitt's you know what. It is sad, really sad and pathetic. If you don't know anything about Economics and have a difficult time thinking about things rationally then this book might be for you. Otherwise, just borrow it from someone when you are really bored."
2,Not worth your time,"This book does not live up to the hype that surrounds it. It contains about 10 pages of interesting information, the rest of it is twaddle. One other nauseating quality, the introduction to each chapter is basically a set of quotes saying what a genius Levitt is. Any rational person will doubt Levitt is a genius based on the garbage in this book."
2,Fluffy trivia,"While the book does have some interesting nuggets of information, it seems hastily written and sloppily put together. There seems to be no central thesis, other than ""Things are not always what you'd expect them to be"". Somehow, I'm underwhelmed."
4,An Interesting Insight,"Levitt sheds light on the unsolved mysteries of the world today in his novel Freakonomics, and finds answers to these mysteries in unexpected places. For example, he attributes the decline in violent crime to Roe v. Wade, claiming that since mothers that could not support or were not ready to have children received abortions, there were less children likely to become criminals. Levitt's novel reveals that Economics is not a dull subject, but one that, with good data, can explain the reality of how the world works, and what drives most people. He offers a new way of thinking which is both stimulating and provocative. Although the topics he explores seem unrelated, they are unified by his main idea that people must find new ways of thinking to understand the world."
3,Freakonomics,"Overall, I enjoyed this book. I thought that it was clever in connecting seemingly meaningless information together in way that made sense. All though, at times it seemed like the information got a little tedious and bored me at times. I felt that the authors had really done their research and were really smart with their analysis, but overall, the book wasnt one of my favorites."
4,Two Thumbs Up!,"Freakonomics is the most interesting and informative book I have ever read. In this book, it discusses extensive research that the two authors, Stephen B. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have found. Anything from teachers cheating to the house market can be found in the book. The authors show throughout the book that numbers don't lie about anything. It can be confusing at times and is very challenging to understand the vocabulary and research. I would recommend this to anyone who likes finding facts about everyday things. I enjoyed it because It was an easy read that I just couldn't put down. After finishing the book, I felt like I had learned so many new things. I give Freakonomics two thumbs up."
5,READ THIS BOOK: LEARN WHAT PROPER THINKING CAN DO,"My first career was in economics; I hold a couple of degrees in the subject. What I love about this book is that Levitt shows readers how to analyze data correctly. No lying with numbers--Levitt gives you truth in numbers. He's separated the years of dreck that budding economists must endure and shown us the pure joy of intellectual and statistical inquiry. He illustrates one of the most basic principles of economics: It's about what's THERE as opposed to what we'd like to be there. This book contains the best definition of regression analysis I've ever seen. Let the light shine, Steven! By the way, he's not a freak, except in the sense that all economists are a little weird. He's mainstream; he works at the University of Chicago. Regular economists love him. He's mainstream. Sorry, Steve."
5,Fun - Interesting - Counter-Intuitive,"This book is fun to read. I don't say that often because a lot of what I read turns out to be mindless tripe. That may be a bit strong, but I have to say - this book was worth reading. Levitt is not going to give you a boring 800 page book filled with stats you can't possibly hope to understand. Instead, he gives you the best parts of his research and findings.If you are someone who does not always follow the herd, and sometimes wonders if what 'experts' say is actually helpful, then check out this book. It may not 'prove' much, but it is more about how we look at the world. For people who go with their gut, even against conventional wisdom, you will love this book.JVD"
2,Don't buy until paperback if at all,"Amazingly light-weight read, especially considering it is written by a world class economist. (Very light on actual facts and data and data analysis.) Would have been more appropriate for a series of articles in Newsweek or Time (or People).Barely interesting suppositions, sometimes poor analysis, especially on the ""guns versus swimming pools"" argument. (His argument, unstated, depends on a false non-multiple guns per home assumption and the assumption that kids visit homes with guns as often as they do homes with pools.)"
4,"Good, but general","This is a fun, quick read. It is a pop NYtimes book. I expected it to have more of an economics focus (this could really use a decent appendix rather than citations to the real meat underlying his analysis).If you have a decent grounding in economics, then read this in a library where you can look up the actual articles. There is no supporting evidence in the book. One is expected to simply believe everything without seeing any summary of the analysis or the data. That really bothered me, but perhaps I expected too much."
3,A few insightful ideas milked dry,"The authors show great insight in finding explanations for phenomena that the rest of the media pool overlooked. However, they took a few ideas that could have been written in 100 pages or so, and balooned it into a 336-page book by beating each point to death in the first two thirds of the book. Then they filled the final third of the book with ""Bonus material"" (filler) that consisted of their original newspaper and magazine articles, and blogs that the first two thirds of the book was built on! The material in this book isn't useful to the average reader anyway."
5,Great read,A great read! Levitt is original and iconoclastic and not afraid if his data offends the politically correct Left or the religious Right.
3,Book was damaged.,The book had about 20 torn pages. That was not mentioned and was contrary to description. I believe they hould have advised.
4,Interesting Read,"I found this book to be very interesting...definitely kept my attention. While I haven't been one to do much reading on economics, decided to give this one a try. The different spin the author puts on economics...hence ""Freakonomics""....sparked my curiosity. Anyone who is interested in questioning/studying very random topics would enjoy reading this book. Enlightening!"
4,Entertaining and a bit informative,"Friends of mine have been recommending this book to me for some time. I have hesitated reading it, I shamelessly admit, because I have a degree in economics and viewed Freakonomics as 'popular economics' and perhaps beneath me. But after giving in to the pressure and finally reading the book, I must admit it is well done.From an economist's perspective, there isn't enough data and/or math. But at the same time, it's not supposed to be a textbook, so I really can't hold that against this book.In my opinion, Freakonomics is what my review title says it is: 'entertaining and a bit informative'. It certainly presents a new way to look at data, but my only question is 'is the data accurate'? I have no reason to think otherwise, but the full data wasn't presented."
2,A Waste of Good Research,"The correlations drawn between such seemingly unrelated topics were almost enough to sustain my interest. But Dubner's writing style did little justice to Levitt's research. Not once was he able to convey he had any understanding of, or even an interest in what he was writing about. The entire book sounded more like some spineless prepubescent seventh grader trumping up someone else's science project.If you're looking for an intelligent book, enjoyable to read, and written by someone who actually sounds like they know what they're talking about I'd recommend The Wisdom of Crowds by James Surowieki."
1,How the KKK is like Real Estate Agents?,"I didn't get beyond this chapter. This book is a paranoid account of how, and supposedly why, teachers, real estate professionals, coaches, athletes and others are immoral liars and cheaters. It is supplanted by article excerpts about the author and is sometimes written in the third person. I don't know how this book became so popular."
2,A good effort,"Despite the effort made and the flashy book cover, this book really was weak. It's just an over-hyped collection of possible correlations that aren't proven enough to be acceptable as correlations for the average reader.I didn't like it. It was disjointed, vague, and in some parts it was just ridiculous word vomit.I don't understand why this book is on the bestseller list or what people get from it. It just made me mad because all it is is a series of ramblings and over-the-top observations."
2,Not a fan of overhyped book,"I felt that this book was so hyped, that I already knew about all its cool parts. It is really not recommendable as it not that fun or interesting. And his ideas and conclusions seem to be a little thin.I put it down."
3,"it's entertaining, but...","My chief concern is Levitt's correlation between legalized abortion and a subsequent dip in crime rates in the 1980s and 90s. One would have to assume that the majority of criminals who committed crimes before the 1980s and 90s were born of mothers who would have otherwise gotten an abortion to terminate their birth. This is REALLY stretching it. How can statistics account for ""would have""s? That Levitt attempts to is admirable but I wouldn't take his conclusion seriously.The whole book is easy to read, written in an intellectual ""People"" magazine style. It's dumbed down nicely for us non-economists.Conclusion: Entertaining at best, naive at worst. Read it."
4,I am not sure what the point was really -- but it was fun!,"My mom, son, some friends, and I all read this book in the period of about 2-3 days each and we all had a fun time doing it. It sure did change our perspective on the science of economics. We realized economics didn't have to be boring and dry. It could also apply to ordinary aspects of daily life."
2,Overrated,"Based on all the great reviews on amazon my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately having just finished the book, I can only conclude to be very disappointed. I am not going to describe details of the book since plenty of other readers have already done so. On a general level however, I have to say that a lot of the supposably stunning theories are not only rather dull but seem to be quite challengable. Without actually thinking too hard you can find a lot of weaknesses in the way Levitt argues that are not even remotely addressed by the data he provides. Bottom line, in my eyes the book is highly overrated and I would not recommend it."
3,clever marketing - nothing else,"The book is disappointing. It has too much buzz for too little substance. The case studies are neither interesting nor amusing. Only the section on real-estate agents is worth reading. The last section on names is merely a filler (15 pages of name lists...come on).Also, the tone is rather annoying. Dubner spends half the book praising the genius of Levitt. I don't get it: an economist starts to think like a sociologist and suddenly he is viewed as a new Einstein!? Freakonomics is mostly an empty shell backed up by efficient and clever marekting, much like Malcom Gladwell's ""Blink""."
3,Thought provoking but falls a bit short,"While Levitt has the propensity to ask many interesting and thought-provoking questions, his data analysis is often suspect to the same tunnel vision which he attributes to many academic studies. Levitt seems so intent on proving the ""conventional wisdom"" wrong that he immediately accepts data from a single source as long as it provides a sensational conclusion. For instance, just about all of Levitt's conclusions on education and parenting come from a single ECLS study conducted 15 years ago. The early chapters on information and cheating are quite solid and alone may be worth the price of the book. However once Levitt tackles education, crime, and parenting his down-to-earth anecdotal approach becomes insufficient to explain these complex issues. Freakonomics is similar to many other pop-science bestsellers in that it makes its subject more approachable through oversimplified explanations and conclusions."
1,Dummy downed,"Any book that starts out every chapter by profusely praising the writer has to be a little worrisome.Nevertheless, I read it hoping for some new insights. None came. It could have been so much more interesting if I could have learned the methods by which he came to his conclusions, or if the conclusions themselves were not such dumb one-liners.It's obvious that one can make numbers reflect what one wants them to reflect. This book was not very intelligently written because the author does not give his audience enough information about his methods or reasoning, nor does he provide any valuable new insights.What I was left with was an ""duh"" feeling, without the preceding ""oh, really?!"""
3,Thought provoking.. but not very investigation-provoking,"Great insights and ways of questioning lots of assumptions. Though the NYTimes Magazine article in the ""Bonus Matter"" section portrays Levitt as being honest about his weaknesses, some of the conclusions reached in the book seem to have been subject to less questioning than desirable. For being a ""popular"" economics book, meant for those who are not fully versed in research methods, I would have hoped that uncertainties might have been explained a little more before suggesting the best option of the uncertainties.I also would have appreciated more references to specific research within the text."
4,Interesting and original,"A very interesting and original approach to the explanation of phenomena in modern society- makes you think again about the wisdom of the so called ""experts"""
2,Don't expect too much,"To some this book was a revelation. I hope they will read a real book on these topics. I found hype. You have to admire a book where one author begins each chapter with a blurb about how the other is a genius.Sample revelations:""Drug dealers live with their mothers because they don't make enough money""..actual evidence presented is that bottom (4th) layer doesn't..the top 2 layers make $100 to $500K which is not bad.""Sumo wrestlers cheat"" evidently those who are desperate to win tend to beat those to whom the match is meaningless. What a surprise.""Crime dropped due to increase in abortions after Roe v. Wade"" Wonderfully controversial assertion based on no real evidence. Sold the book though. More police and more jail-time did it.And so on..Second half of the book descends into meandering presentations since they ran out of cutesy stuff.My fear is that this character really is a respected economist."
5,Freakonomics Rev Ed CD: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything,Funny and interesting way of looking at economics. I have really enjoyed listening to this updated book on CD.
