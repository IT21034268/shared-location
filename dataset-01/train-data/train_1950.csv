2,Less appealing to my dog than other treats,"My dog didn't care for these treats at all. I typically use treats likeCardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Lamb, 3.5 OuncesandBeneful Snackin' Slices Crunchy Dog Treatsas well as homemade treats. This was the first treat I gave my dog that he actually left virtually untouched. He gave it a slight lick but then left it on the floor and has never embraced these sense. They make work well if your dog is not a picky eater (my dog usually isn't but he didn't like these anyway), but if you find your dog isn't a fan of every food or treat you might want to try a sample at the Vet before investing in a full bag"
4,Basic coffemaker,"I like the size of the cup. In regular store, you can only find 4-cup, which a little too small, or 8-cup, which is too big.It's not fancy, but makes a cup of coffee in few minutes."
4,Decent little coffeemaker,"Cute little space-saving coffeemaker. Quick brewing and quiet, just right for the occasional coffee drinker. The decanter DOES dribble a little if you try to pour too quick--you kind of have to pour like you're at a little kids tea party--just a reflection of the tiny-sized decanter. Certainly worth its price, though."
2,Not So Good,"I bought this coffee maker because of its compact size, but returned it a week later. I found it very difficult to avoid spillage when pouring the water into the coffee maker AND the coffee into a cup. The problem was worse if making more than 4 cups.Another problem was the taste of the coffee. I like my coffee full of flavor. I have been using drip coffee makers for several years and think I know how to get the coffee ""just right"". But, every carafe of coffee from this tasted weak, and MUCH too hot, almost scalding!"
3,Drippy but coffee okay,"Half the time I make a pot, water drips from behind the carafe onto the hot plate. Sometimes it's a tablespoon or more, which is very annoying. Coffee is okay if you use good coffee, but you'd get more flavor for the same amount I expect with one that uses a cone filter. Not recommended."
1,Save your $$,"Don't buy it. Throw your $20 bill in the trash instead ... It would be less frustrating. Poorly designed and engineered. After three days, we have replaced it."
1,poor quality construction,"bought this new, had for one day and it broke... the spring loaded drip hole plug fell apart, only made coffee twice. they use a soft washer to hold the pin and it pulled apart by itself. Dag-nab-it!"
1,Mess Express,"As others have pointed out, the lid and spout are poorly executed. If you make a full pot, it is impossible to pour coffee without creating a mess, unless you pour very, very slowly. The coffee hits the lid and flows out at the sides of the spout, missing the target completely. I don't understand why they didn't go back to the drawing board after a prototype was made."
3,great size-hard to clean,nice capacity to make two large cups of coffee. Very hard to remove and replace the filter cup for cleaning.
2,poorly-designed coffeepot,"I bought this coffeepot because we needed something small, something that makes a cup or two at a time.The coffee tasted good, and the pot seemed to work well, but I couldn't stand the design of the filter.In order to dump the coffee grounds, you have to unhinge(it is a swing-out) the entire filter compartment,and it's not easy to line up and put back on.It was just too inconvenient. This pot DOES NOT have a removable filter."
1,Makes bad coffee,I haven't had a problem with this item but that doesn't really matter. I won't use it anyway because it makes awful coffee. I am sorry I wasted my money on it.
2,More of a mess maker,"This coffee maker makes coffee, but it also makes a huge mess. It is practically impossible to pour the coffee into your cup without getting almost as much on the kitchen counter! I think it is the extra wide spout and the reason they give you 5 cups instead of 4 in the pot. This spillage also happens when pouring the water into the reservoir. Also, it you remove the carafe during brewing, it is not drip free. It will dribble and splash against the coffee maker. The coffee making is fairly quick and quiet. I prefer my old coffee maker that had a slide out basket and a pot that was easier to deal with."
2,"Carafe is not great, but the coffee is fantastic","I love this coffeemaker. The carafe does not have the little plastic lib that you put your thumb on to pop the top up which is the only major drawback. The coffee is wonderful though. I think it is brewed at a hotter temp than the other coffee makers I've had. Before this, I had the 5 cup Black and Decker where the carafe just fell apart after about 4 months. The bottom dropped off the handle. This is what set me looking for a new one. I never realized the inferiority of the coffee it produced until I tried the Hamilton Beach. I also had a 4 cup DeLonghi before the B&D; which was okay, but not nearly as good as this one.Update as of 11/23/11 - The no drip plug fell out a year after I had this and now the water reservoir is leaking so I get water all over the counter when I brew the coffee. Coffee still tastes great. I am very disappointed that this model didn't even last 2 years. Back to the drawing board."
2,"Heard great things, overated","I think this film was grossly overrated, it may have touched the hearts of a few romantics, but it did nothing for me, I will soon put it up for sale or trade in. I am very hard to please when it comes to films, and I feel that I have very good judgement, I love british films, espcially the period dramas. I have a library full."
1,Very brief review,"The acting was A.BOM.IN.A.BLE. By everyone but especially Iain Glen and Patsy Kensit. I felt as though I was watching a high school production. Both are good looking but that's as far as it goes. When Hetty was found guilty of the murder of her newborn child, Kensit let out the most ridiculous cry I've ever heard. No pain, no sorrow, no regret, no fear, just a screech. And Adam was beyond weak; he was downright wimpy as played by Glen. These two need to take some serious acting classes. Now. The accents were awful; everything was awful. AW.FUL. Avoid it."
2,only Average,"I did not like Adam Bede. I thought it was booring and tedious.Since this is the only version I have seen, I would not be inclined to check out other versions. I just thought the whole story was un-interesting."
3,Adam BeBe,"If you like English movies and novels, then you will probably like this movie. It was a little dark at times but I still liked it."
5,Good story!,I saw this version of Adam Bede years ago and was so glad to find it available on Amazon. It is a very good adaptation of the book and well acted. The DVD was a nice price too!
5,Delivery time was outstanding,"My wife started a hobby of needlepoint and I wanted to get her a book explaining the stitches and other details of hobby (I know nothing about it). I ordered the book on a Tuesday night. That Friday she was flying to NY and if possible wanted the book for the flight. Beyond any expectations, the book showed up Thursday night.As far as content, she stated that she liked the book and it helped here get started."
5,The Needlepoint Book,This is a great book. It is in good condition and it arrived on time. The projects in the book are exciting. I'm so happy to have it
1,Preface alone concerns me,"I would never buy this book. In the very first line of the Preface, she writes that for centuries needlepoint was done in one stitch--tent stitch. WRONG. I have researched the history of needlepoint, or just ""needlework"" as the Elizabethans called it. They used MANY different stitches, most of which are very uncommon today. Not only were strictly what we would needlepoint stitches used, but many stitches that are more recognizable as other types of embroidery, like couching, satin stitch, etc."
3,Relationship between young white and older person of color?,"Framed as a coming of age story for an orphan, this book really emphasizes the travails of the Chinook man. The boy does step forward when the man needs support, and is more than repaid soon after. I wonder what conversations the author had with modern Native American activists--and what they would think of the relationship between the characters. There's a long tradition of young whites relying on lowly benefactors of color (e.g. Taylor's The Cay); does this one fall within it? The boy's aid does not seem patronizing to me; perhaps this is a step forward. Too bad the book never caught on with librarians and educators."
3,Skywalker - The David Thompson Story,Good info for the college years. Not enough ABA or NBA footage.Satisfactory for the true DT fan.
5,Modern Katana,"A beast of a sword. Has a natural feel when cutting. The weight of the sword does the work, putting power behind it is optional.Traditional katana collectors may be put off by the lack of a hamon. But don't be fooled. A hamon is not necessary with the purity and heat treatment of the modern steel. It will resist chipping better than a traditional katana as well as take more abuse from flexing pressure. Hamons have disadvantages as well and should not be there if the the reasons for having them are non-existent.Great overall sword."
4,Better than expected,"OK. So I have considered one of these swords for a few years. The first review notwithstanding, I was very impressed with the sharpness, steel and quality when I received the weapon. Perfect?, No. Collector quality, certainly not. However, for the price and availability, what do you really expect. Nicely weighted (but potentially a bit heavy if you are used to a ""real"" one) and quite sharp out of the box. I expect that if you are going to hack away at rope etc. as in the vid, you will need to learn to sharpen it. This tends to be the 'downfall' of any knife. However, the practical and 'real' product one would expect from Cold Steel is certainly there and if you would like a katana of reasonable quality, this is the way to go. It is not like the Japanese are letting real ones out of Japan with any real regularity for a reasonable price."
5,Awsome,"This Katana is much better than described; balanced, very sharp, handle is well made much more than decoration, the wood scabbard is VERY well finished - same quality as the blade. Glad I purchased."
3,Decent for the price.,"I wasn't expecting much to be honest...basically a decent piece of spring steel that I could rely on in case I'm ever without a gun if SHTF. Mix that with a bit of wanna-be Michonne-ish inner geek and you have an idea of my expectation. Never intend on hanging it on the wall, or worshipping its curves for hours on end...just wanting a tool. I have to say my expectation is mostly met except in one way...the damn thing is dull. Not being an experienced ninja/samauri...or even an amature, I'm not so sure what to expect in the way of sharpness. I was under the impression these were supposed to be hair-shaving razors. Instead it's more like a dull pocket knife. I'm pretty sure I can work on the blade a bit with some whetstones, leather, and rouge...but feel a bit cheated here. It's also a bit dirty, but I expected there would be some machining oils from mass production."
1,Arrived damage!,"Item arrived damaged. Scabbard was scratched, chipped, cracked at the top, leaving sword falling out easily. AND, the bottom metal piece was totally missing, exposing an unfinished cheap wooden tip. This is not worth the money spent. I sent for a replacement, which did not go over too well, either...so, sending both back for FULL REFUND. Buying a Hanwei! Much better packaging and performance, I hear...we'll see."
1,handle broke without any effort.,Not as durable as advertised. Scabbard cracked on deliver. Handle was a little wonky when received. Sword handle broke on 2nd day on owning after cutting a 3inch piece of wood.
4,A bit heavy.,"I haven't tested this sword yet, but it seem like the craftsmanship is very nice and durable for intermediate price tag. Im satisfied with this purchased and I'm happy that I have a decent katana sword for my first time collection..I would recommend this to anyone interested for 1st time sword buyer who can't afford the handmade Japanese sword."
2,50% isn't a good percent,I ordered four blades as gifts. Unfortunately two of the four blades were damaged during shipping. When I tried to have them replaced the item had been sold out and I was only offered a refund. Because they were gifts it put me in a bind. The blade is of great quality but the scabbard is cheap and useless.
1,poor cutting edge swordC not worth to buy,"this katana is not like it showing on the video, you can even press your finger on the blade and get no hurt. I am a swordsmanship practicer and I don't think this is a good katana for people who like Japanese sword."
4,HIgh marks on voice and keyboards,"With the vast amount of Christmas music either recorded or sung live at this time of year, the Captain and Tennille version is the icing on the cake. Coming from an appreciation of their music to start with, their contribution is as expected and fun at times. The one stand-out besides the wondeful voice of Toni and Daryl's keyboard imagination is the message. It isn't too preachy but does it succinctly. Be nice to people all year round. All in all a fun album from the C&T camp."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"i suppose that for little kids, much of this cd will work. for the most part, this recording is a one-note samba...and not a good one. daryl playing the synthesizer (cheesey most of the time) and toni singing (good but not great vocals). a couple of the original songs might be great with a ""proper"" arrangement and production. don't expect anything past what you might hear at your office Christmas party with somebody playing their cassio, etc. this is a disappointing recording, considering some of the really terrific past efforts by C&T. unfortunate, plastic, shallow, and uncomfortably ameteurish. i hope that ""real"" versions of both ""Christmas Star"" and ""The Secret Of Christmas"" will appear some day. til then, if you're a fan like me, you'll listen to this disc and then permanently file it - if you're not a fan, then start with one of the older classics."
3,Poor Quality Refurbishment Job,"From dealing with other companies I have come to expect refurbished products to look just like a brand new one. Panasonic, however, puts very hard to remove sticky backed paper labels on the product in places where you need to remove it and then get out the Goo-Gone.I don't expect to have to spend 1/2 of an hour cleaning up a new purchase before I can use it. There is really no excuse for such a poor presentation of the product and it is not worth the few dollars saved compared to a new one.The phone works ok, but it's range is less than the 900 MHZ digital phone it replaced. Sometimes ""advanced"" technology doesn't really move the ball forward as much as the advertising leads one to think."
2,Not What I Expected,"After reading the review from February 13, 2000, I decided to buy this CD. I was looking for the song ""The Prayer"", and the reviewer said ""This has the tracks with vocals from the soundtrack, original artists ..."" Well there are only 5 songs on the CD, and they are NOT sung by the original artists. Some woman sings all the songs. This would probably be a great CD if all you wanted was the background music, but don't buy it if you want the actual songs, sung by the actual artists."
5,A series I'm hooked on now!,"On the eve of the restoration, the Morland family, led by Ralph, finds itself in reduced circumstances, and eager to regain lost property once King Charles returns to take his throne. Annunciata, age 15, has higher aspirations than marriage to her cousin Kit; and she goes to London, to take part in court life there. This was my introduction to the Morland Dynasty, and I have to say that it didn't disappoint! Harrod-Eagles makes English history accessible while at the same time creating an engaging, entertaining plot and characters. Although there are characters in The Black Pearl that appeared in The Oak Apple, I found that it wasn't completely necessary to read them first--although I will, since the series is such a treat."
1,It's not what advertised,"The base of the wiper fitted correctly. However, the BMW 525i, has a rounded windshield. So even with all the pressure points, that they say it has, it doesn't fit the windshield. Only the corners touches the glass, the rest not even close.So, beware, it's not what they say it is."
1,Garbage,Had to put my old blades on streaked my windows. The blades where filthy. Emailed trico and they sent me anew set haven't tried them yet.
4,Quality product,Vest is excellent looks super. I would have given it four stars but the sizing was a little off. I normally wear a XL but the XL was a bit small. The price was to great to send back so I will be giving them to family members as gifts.
3,Works but manual is terrible,"This unit works as advertised but the manual is awful. Be prepared for some experimentation. When the indoor receiver stopped displaying the outdoor temp, it took me a while to figure out that the receiver's batteries were low.A good manual would greatly increase the value of this product."
3,Great Unit - Hate Date Format,"The unit functions flawlessly. It is a good value for the money, but I have one complaint. The date function shows the date first followed by the month. i.e., July 7 will be 6.7. While this is an accepted format in other parts of the world, it is confusing to most US residents. Especially when the date can be read both ways. I looked at the unit and wrote down June 7 instead of July 6 all day. I can't find a solution in the product manual, so I placed a piece of tape over the date portion of the display to alleviate the problem."
3,interesting book from a great woman pioneer,"I actually found this book a little difficult to read as I couldn't quite make out if Annie was actually an atheist or not. However, reading the book encouraged me to find out more about the author. It's because of brave women like her that women enjoy many of the freedoms that we do today. In her time it was difficult for anyone, never mind a woman, to challenge the religious views of the period. It was a bit difficult to understand in places as we are so removed from those times that it wasn't always clear what she was arguing against. However, it's a worthwhile read."
1,A limp and hurried retelling,"Read the book. The movie is terrible and only hints at the depth and beauty of the story CS Lewis wrote. I am sorely disappointed. I imagine it would be a hard story to bring to the screen, but good lord, if they can put ""Life of Pi"" on the big screen, they could do this one. The movie only vaguely recalls the plot of the book, which is so much fun to read, and the movie jumps quickly and shallowly from point to stupid point. It makes me worry that an entire generation will miss out on the book, because they won't be inspired to read it by this lazy hack job."
5,The best movie of 2011,"This is one of the best movies made this year. A great following for the first two movies. Everyone should love this movie. It has great acting, the special affects are second to none, and the story is captivating. I can't wait for the fourth movie to be made, The Silver Chair."
4,Good movie for the family,"Good effects, good characters, great story.If you liked the Lion/Witch/Wardrobe and Prince Caspian movies, you'll like this as well.Of all the books in the Narnia series, Dawn Treader was my favorite, so I ended up liking this one better than the two before it."
3,"Okay sequel, alright adaption, average fantasy movie","This is my least favorite Narnia movie. I didn't like how they added the whole fog element which in my opinion was dumb. It's fantasy, couldn't they have come up with something better than fog?! And not a fan of them constantly using the ghost of the White Witch. She's dead. Leave her there. You can tell Disney didn't make this movie like the previous two because it's missing that certain something that made the other two great. However, I did love the whole battle at Dark Island which actually wasn't in the book but ultimately saved the movie.Overall, this movie feels awkward next to Caspian and the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's still fun to watch and experience if you're a Narnia fan, but don't expect that certain magic that the previous two gave you. Hopefully if they choose to do the Magician's Nephew or the Silver Chair next, they do it right and stay more faithful to the book."
3,All the flash and 3D goodness in the world cant make me give this a higher rating.,"not gotten past 5 minutes but when I see, ONCE AGAIN The theme repeated from Prince caspian of ""Im a king, I've led men into battle I should be shown more respect!""I prefer the theme in the books that they barely remembered narnia or thought it some elaborate dream until they returned then the fog lifted from their memories.The Graphics are spectacular and the 3D goodness icompelling, just if you want something true to the themes of narnia be aware this shows Typical Disney fixation with apealing to a broader audience, at the expense of diehard fans."
3,Die Hard Fans Beware! Not completely accurate.,"I will say that this movie comes in 2nd place after ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"" movie. However, it is still incredibly inaccurate and like me, die hard fans will be able to point out what those things are.This version, however, is 80% more accurate than the ""Prince Caspian"" movie. The screen writers played with and twisted the storyline for ""Prince Caspian"" too much. However, I still wouldn't buy this version of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader ~ it's not accurate enough for me. And frankly, any Narian fans should just stick with ""Focus On The Family Radio Theatre"" CD versions of the books, they are word for word and offer all 7 books on disc."
5,Love this movie,This is my favorite of the Narnia series. It gives a clearer view of the spiritual aspects that affect daily life.
3,The first movie was way better!,This is an ok movie with good effects. Nice to watch with the family. It is very entertaining for the kids.
5,Great movie,I love this movie! Its very unique and although it may not follow the book to a T its still definitely worth watching!
4,good move,"good movie recommend it really, really, really, yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes ye"
2,"Good movie, absolutely awful packaging","I found the movie to be lots of fun. Yes, it's different from the book, but the movie presents a unifying theme that allows the story to be told in a visual, adventurous way. The movie itself gets a good 4 stars, which means this review is marked for two stars because...The packaging for this particular double pack gets 1 star. The discs are actually glued onto the package. Yes, glued. And not only glued, but glued within an oddly designed cardboard sleeve that can't be fully opened. Once removed, the blu-ray disc is unplayable; the glue won't come off easily without scratching the disc. I didn't even try to force the DVD disc out of the package as I'm guessing the same problem will happen there as well (and I'd rather not risk breaking it trying to pry it out). Oddly, the digital download disc is the most easily accessible and best packaged of the three. Horrible, horrible, horrible packaging."
5,Incredible computer graphics !!!,"This is an outstanding follow-up to two wonderful family movies. Truely a movie everyone will love to view over, and over again. J&C."
1,Should have changed the title,"They should have changed the title of this movie, as it had almost no relation to the book. I was so pleasantly surprised when The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe came out, that, even though Prince Caspian was a big disappointment, somehow I thought this one would be as wonderful as the first. It wasn't. What a waste of time."
3,Rip-off incorrect aspect ratio,"My comments here are not about the film itself, which I happen to love.Fox has cropped the theatrical aspect ratio from 2:35-1 down to 1:78-1, sacrificing visual imagery from the sides and adding more to the top and bottom. I really don't need more sky and more sea water, and would prefer to see the film that the director intended me to see.Shame on Fox for compromising the aspect ratio. With the laserdisc and DVD revolutions behind us, I thought the industry had embraced full widescreen. Obviously I was incorrect about that, but why does Fox want to sell us a dumbed-down product?"
2,Boring,"I liked pieces of this movie, but as a whole I thought it was lacking. The story felt underdeveloped and some of the characters were just ridiculous (e.g. Eustess....why???) It just got so boring that I fast forwarded through the whole thing. I was sad this was not as good as the previous Narnia movies."
3,Voyage of the Dawn Treader movie,"I love the Chronicles of Narnia Books, but the movie, ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"" wasn't as well done as the first two movies. It seemed to take more liberties with the storyline."
5,We like it,My family and I like this kind of movies of adventures and fantasy. I did not regret this purchase at all.
2,In an Envelope?,1. It arrive only in a paper envelope.2. There were sound burps3. It was obvious that it was a copy of a commercial dis.
4,Enjoyable!,"I watched this movie with my eight year old daughter. We watch the movie after reading each of the books. The characters were well cast and the storyline was well laid out. The only element of the movie that lacked development was the ""mist"". What was it? what was its purpose? Otherwise, very enjoyable. Looking forward to more Narnia movies to come!"
3,LUKEWARM NARNIA,Not exciting as it's predecessor's. Who can forget the epic battle scene in Prince Caspian.The plot is very weak. The kids are older. The flashback w/Susan & Peter was nice butTwo short. Very lite entertainment. No brain twister.
4,Kids love this series,The kids were totally engaged with this and the other titles in this series. Normal children are transported to a time/place where they are heroes and interact with a talking lion and other fantastic characters.
5,Favorite book - favorite movie of the series,"Loved this book the most of the Narnia series. I think this movie was very well done. The Dawn Treader looked exactly as I imagined it. They made some subtle changes, (which seems to be a big trend anymore - why change a good story?), but not enough to take away my enjoyment of the movie."
1,The Chronicles of Narnia : The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,"I think this issue of narnia very bad because there is no good place for her disc. whereas there are 4 discs in its products. A blu-ray disc, 2 disc DVD and a digital copy disc. should think twice about buying this edition. or just buy the regular edition. so therefore no place to attach the disc could be scratched discs very much like what I experienced."
3,Really?,Good for wholesome entertainment but lacks direction in the thematic development that really makes this book great. Not a lot of depth. The plot is much different with the emphasis kind of changed to the mist. The book is really a voyage that commands the imagination. With this direction that just doesn't happen. The actors don't seem captivated with the extaordinary turn of events.
1,Terrible Packaging Job,"This review only concerns the packaging, which is the worst I've seen for a movie. It comes in a trifold case with an extra fold down piece for the digital copy disk. The problem is that the movies can fall out the sides of the trifold case since they are only stuck into a slot. However, the slots have glue inside, so one of the DVDs was actually glued into the slot and required me to pry it out and remove the glue from the disk (the data side, not the case side). The digital copy is the only disk that is held in securely, but they use some kind of rubber piece instead of the traditional plastic ""button"", so it is nearly impossible to get the disk off without breaking it. I don't know who decided this case was a good design, but I'd recommend you just get a simple version of this movie instead of the deluxe case that risks damaging your movies."
3,"Good movie, horrible case","The movie is enjoyable, but the blu-ray/DVD/digital copy combo is in the worst packaging I've ever encountered.The effects are great. I enjoyed this more than the last Narnia movie, but not as much as the first one.I especially loved the ending of this movie. Aslan and the wall of water was very well done and made for a moving scene.I did not see this in theaters, but the the original screen ratio of 2.35:1 was modified to 1.78:1 so it will completely fill a standard wide-screen TV (Commentary mentions this was done for a more intimate feel).Now for the crappy case: The case is a tri-fold glossy cardboard case. The DVD and blu-ray discs are inside sleeves on the right and left. Both my discs were covered with glue from the case and came scratched up. This is the first time I've seen a blu-ray scratched. The center houses a picture booklet with a fold down place for the digital download.I do not recommend buying this product because of the terrible case."
5,The magic of Narnia is back!,"Narnia 3 The Voyage of the Dawn Treader brings back the magic and specialness that seemed to be lacking in Narnia 2 Prince Caspian. The movie adds some extra story elements not seen in the book, but I think worked out well. The scenes with Eustace were very touching and delivered some very good messages. Aslan was done well as was all the CGI. Overall I think it was a wonderfully heartwarming and enjoyable movie."
5,Narnia purchase,I received the Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in a very timely manner. The package was as stated. I would order from the vendor again.Thank you
5,Best in the Narnia series,"This is the best movie so far in the Narnia series and I loved the first two as well. Unlike too many other series movies, with the Narnia movies, each new one is better than its predecessors. This one was as fast paced as it was inspirational. Highly recommended."
4,"Not extraordinary, but entertaining, enjoyable","After the great first installment of Narnia, and the indifferent second one (of which I recall only very little, despite being released just a couple of years ago) this third episode in the series (that can be called Pirates of the Narnian Sea) is entertaining and enjoyable. Only two of the brothers are here (pretty Anna Popplewell appears in a couple of cameos) but this is almost make up by the presence here of cousin Eustace, providing good comic relief as a whiny spoiled brat. The big letdown, as in the other episodes, is Aslan, the insufferable Christ-Lion, with his obvious platitudes and third rate new age mysticism. The scene where the mouse goes happily into the kingdom of Aslan (that is, commits suicide) is among the worst scenes I seen in a mainstream movie in a long time. Fortunately, Aslan got relatively little screen time, so the movie is entertaining for most of the ride."
3,"Green mist, dragons and sea monsters","Jeez can we make the title any longer? This third chapter in the filmed Narnia series certainly has its moments but it just seemed to plod along most of the time. The plot involves the two siblings from the previous movies returning to Narnia through a picture hanging in their bedroom. An unlikeable cousin gets sent along with them.Lighthearted at first, the humor escaped me throughout the movie. Back to the plot. Somehow they have to gather 7 swords lost along with some noblemen. Once they gather all these swords in one place, something good happens...oh yeah...they can defeat the evil green mist which is kidnapping all the common folk. The green mist of course, is really Tilda Swinton. Wait, wasn't she dead? On the positive side, the action is revved up at the end and I always like dragons and sea monsters."
4,Move over Harry Potter,"We got both Harry Potter's new DVD and the new Narnia DVD. Feel asleep during the very, very dark Potter one. Was wide awake for Narnia. Highly recommend for all ages."
5,Voyage of the Dawn Treader,Man-oh-man is it easy to shop online. My dear daughter in law posted a list of things the grands (aren't they though) wanted for Christmas online and I pointed and clicked and checked out and low and behold packages started showing up at my back door. It's almost too easy.
3,"Closer to the book, than Prince Caspian","As a HUGE fan to the book series, I was disappointed in the MAJOR deviations that the films took from the original plots of the Chronicals books. The Voyage of the DT film was beautifully done and kept the spirit of the book story line. Of course there was some adaptation but it was done really well and the characters and storyline stayed true to the original."
5,The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader,I loved this movie The Chronicles of Nania: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and would recommend it to all of my friends. I am looking forward to collecting the entire series.
1,Voyage of the Green Mist,I handled the changes they made to Prince Caspian. I think most of them were positive. But this movies only resembles C.S. Lewis's plot in a hand full of ways; the biggest one being the fact that it takes place on a ship.
3,Weakest entry of the series,"Edmund (Skander Keyes), Lucy (Georgie Henley), and their obnoxious cousin Eustace (Will Poulter) are hurled into Narnia, where they join Caspian in a search for seven lost lords.""Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" was the weakest of C.S. Lewis's books, and it is the weakest film in the series to date as well. The screenwriters cobble together a serviceable overall arc for the story, which did not exist in the book, but it remains a terribly episodic narrative, and the filmmakers do not summon enough inspiration to make it more than one damn thing after another. As a result, it is intermittently entertaining. New characters and subplots are introduced into a story that is already too busy, and there are some pointless CGI action scenes, such as a sea monster attack, that fail to create much excitement because I could sense that nothing was really at stake."
2,Poor Packaging,My review is nothing to do with the movie but concern about the packaging.I found the Blu ray & DVD copies inserted at both sides of the paper sleeves are without adequate protection. This caused scratches on the disks due to the hard surfaces.Consideration should be taken to protect them.
4,Hilarious + Interesting action scenes + Beautiful scenery = A solid family movie,"- This movie is halrious, especially because of the actions and voice of the mouse, Reepicheep. He made my friend and I laugh quite a few times.- The action scenes are enjoyable.- The scenery is beautiful.In short, it's a solid family film. We watched it in the theatre."
4,Good movie terrible packaging,I give 4 stars for the movie but this review isn't about the movie. This is about the packaging. At first I thought it was pretty cool. Blu-Ray and DVD combo with collector post cards. The problem was that the pockets that held the discs didn't hold them. The glue that was supposed to hold the pocket together actually held the discs in place. I had to clean off the blu ray and dvd disc before viewing them. While cleaning the DVD I realized that the glue wasn't coming off. After further inspection I realized it wasn't glue but scratches. I can only assume the scratches were from the packaging and the lack of a good sleeve to hold the disc. I have never bought a movie with the disc already being scratched. And it wasn't just a little. It was all over. The Blu Ray had glue all over it but it came off with good cleaner and there were no scratches.
3,"Not the book, but good family fare","My 13 year old daughter loves all three of the latest Narnia movies. Not as good as the first two or the book, this one is still fun for the whole family (beware the sea monster scene near the end for younger kids - though it saves the movie for older boys). They added a storyline about gathering lost swords to stop an evil fog that is not in Lewis' book. But it works on two levels - it connects all the subplots into one (the book is too episodic to make into a movie as is) and emphasizes the theme of resisting temptation."
2,bad packaging ;(,There is no tabs for the disks! They just throw the discs in the slots which allows them to rattle around during transit greatly increasing the odds your disks will arrive damaged. I can't believe amazon sold this product as it obviously flawed in every way when it comes to storing your media.P.S. Amazon replaced item no questions asked so was taken care of just as you would expect amazon to do.
4,Great movie for adventure fans with kids in their lives,"I got the 3 movies on special editions.This movie is full of great effects and a very good christian view about Aslan, for those who have kids (like me) its fine.The second CD is not so cool like the others that have specials about the books and the develop of the movie.But if you like to share great movie adventures with your kids and also it have a good message at the final of it, i reccomend go for this; the price also is fine."
2,3D was a waste,"The story was ok, but the 3D effect was almost completely absent. It was one of my first 3D purchases so I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be seeing. Since, I've purchased Resident Evil Afterlife (which was an amazing 3D movie), Open Season, and Legend of the Guardians. All three of those will show you what 3D should look like. Narnia is a total ripoff if you're purchasing this edition for the 3D effects."
3,A Step Back,"The Blu Ray picture was very good, however the story was only OK. I loved the first movie and liked the second one. It seems the franchise takes a step back with each release."
2,Unable To Give As A Gift,When I purchased this DVD it was for a gift and therefore I paid extra to buy a 'new' one. When it arrived there was a hole punched in the DVD packaging and the celephane was 'raggedy' on both ends. Also there was a WALMART sticker on the front of it. It could NOT be given as a gift so I had to go purchase another copy that would be presentable. I can say that it arrived in a timely fashion.
1,I can't believe what a piece of junk this film is,"Well, my mom liked the first movie of The Chronicles, so for her birthday last year, she wanted to go check this out. I have to say, no movie has ever bored me so much. What a terrible film. I'm 19yrs old, and am very open-minded when it comes to everything & anything, but this was horrible! It's horrendous. I've never really disliked a movie like this. The 4 star rating is absurd. There are some great movies on here with 3.5 or 3 star ratings. Total BS. Don't waste your money."
2,"Chronicles of ""Bore""nia","This one was by FAR the absolute worse in all three films. It just sucked so bad. No Peter, no Susan. Just Lucy, Edmund, and some overly annoying cousin that you actually wish would just die within the first 5 minutes of meeting him. I mean this kid actually ruined the movies for me! This was just amiss of the first two films' entertainment value, and how can you even have a story about the Pevensies without Susan, and Peter? UGH. I really hope ""The Silver Chair"" is better than this when it releases. Two thumbs down on this one. You'll see."
1,Worst packaging i've seen on a dvd box set,"I know a lot of people have said this already, but the packaging on this is HORRIBLE! You have to forcibly yank to get the digital copy and dvd discs out of their respective sleeves only to find that there was a big splot of glue holding them into the sleeve. Now that both of these discs are virtually unplayable you're only left with the Blu Ray disc.This was a decent movie, probably my least favorite of the trilogy, but not bad. I would recommend that you do NOT get this edition of the movie if you don't want to pay for the Blu Ray and two glued-up discs."
1,It's about PROFIT not Prophet,"First things first: this review is about the so-called Explorer Pack 2-Disc DVD. I'm not reviewing the film. Fox has a list price of $29.95 or so on this and let me tell you that adds up to RIP OFF!!! Reading the list of features on disc 2 of this set one would think they were getting some info on the making of the film or something along those lines- well no, what you get is about 45 minutes (if that) of clips from the film with some voice over comments in three to four minute mini-features. And the new animated adventure or whatever it's called is what- 5 minutes or so of minimal animation? I won't comment on the included kiddie game; maybe it's fun to play once or twice... Believe me, I've bought lots of Special Edition and 2- disc sets and this has got to be the WORST of them. I wish someone had written a review like this before I WASTED my money on this particular DVD release. I hope I'll save someone else their money."
3,The third in the current Narnia series.,"I've seen all three of these movies in the theater, and they are simply OK. However, I did enjoy them, and own the first two, so it seemed natural to buy the third. All I can say is there's nothing in any of them that compares to seeing Lucy step out of the back of the wardrobe and into the magical snow of Narnia in the first movie. I could truly say it's all downhill from there. Still, they are fun to watch, this one as much as the other two."
5,Help for hip dysplasia,"HyaFlex is a wonderful product. My beloved basset hound became stiff with hip dysplasia at a young age. He couldn't stand on all four feet while eating and limped noticably after waking up. His vet prescribed Glucosamine and Chondroitin which helped but the limping remained. I kept wanting to give him Rimadyl but the vet didn't want a long term management. I discovered HyaFlex online and the results are amazing! The stiffness and limping subsided. My basset feels wonderful. I asked my vet's advice and he said ""go for it."" I give Humphrey HyaFlex every morning on his food. It is odorless and tasteless. I wouldn't be without this wonderful product!"
3,"KLH HTA-4100 For the $$, not bad!","I got these at Sams a long time ago because of the price and it was a complete speaker system. The front, center and surround speakers are ok but they will leave you wanting more but if you don't want to pay more then they are fine. The sub is scary at times it really shakes the room, I love it. Maybe there's better subs out there but I'm happy."
3,"So far, So good...","I bought this speaker set for a buddy. I had my doubts, judging from the price, but my wallet prevailed. So far, I am rather blown away by the sound from the small (4'?) speakers. Loud and clear, great highs, non-muddy bass. Really amazed! Now, as to the sub-woofer...it lights, hums, etc, but I am not getting sound out of it. It is hooked up correctly, so far as I can tell, and I am going to assume the lack of sound is related to a setting on his home theater system. If we figure this out, and the sub-woofer proves out fine, I would not hesitate to recommend this if 100 watts per channel is enough for you."
3,Easy Listening,"This is a pleasant sartorial approach to the performance of Four Seasons. You hear a muffled interpretation of Vivaldi's dramatic sensibilities. Christopher Hogwood's Academy of Ancient Music recordings provide an extraordinary panorama of the musical voices in these pieces. The Boston Symphony feels like a perfunctory effort; the Academy of Ancient Music realize the excitement and drama in this work.Vivaldi - The Four Seasons / The Academy of Ancient Music, Christopher HogwoodVivaldi - The Four Seasons / The Academy of Ancient Music, Christopher Hogwood"
5,Awsome,This book was so real. I believe this story solved the case. Can't wait for Hollywood to make the Movie!
5,A New Understanding of Music,"I am only 18 years old and not really a jazz fan, but after hearing Standard Time, jazz music seems much more of an alternative to listen to. I heard the CD through my friend whose dad is in the music business and surprisingly to myself I enjoyed it. The songs ""Baby it's cold outside"" and ""What a little moonlight can do"" are two songs that I enjoyed the most. With the singing of that girl, whoever playing the trumpet,and most important the voice of Steve Tyrell the two songs gave me a sense of comfortness and romanticness that i have never heard before. As you can see with my use of ""that girl"" and ""whoever playing the trumpet"" I know nothing about jazz and if i enjoyed it everyone can and will enjoy it. I suggest everyone buy a copy for anyone they know and spread the enjoyment of the voice of Steve Tyrell."
2,a poor mans Rod Stewart,I thought I would find a new entertainer but all I heard was a bad immitation of Rod stewart's great American Song Book. I sure won't waste my money on this road company singer again.
4,"Good listen, but not as good as his debut","I really loved Steve Tyrell's first CD and was so excited to hear this one. My husband got it for me for Christmas, and while I do like it, it just hasn't got that ""something"" that his first CD had, imo. Love the cut with Jane Monheit. She rocks."
5,An unusual voice combined with the usual standards ...,An unusual voice combined with the usual standards makes for a winning combination on this CD. It is fantastic.
5,Great!,"I heard Steve Tyrell's song ""On the Sunny side of the street"" on the Father of the Bride Movie and I fell in Love with his voice. Never heard of him before then, but now I ordered a lot of his CDS. AND I LOVE THIS CD!! Great! Great! Great!"
5,broad appeal,"I would imagine that this CD would have very broad appeal. I would recommend it to anyone that loves great tunes & spirited performances. I am very devoted to jazz (the 'real' stuff...Miles, Coltrane, Peterson, etc)and I was pleasantly surprised that a 'mainstream'/Pop recording could be so enjoyable and (dare I say) substantial. I was impressed with the quality of the arrangements and performances. The arrangements are 'tight': concise, tasteful solos; appropriate tune lengths (3 or 4 minutes), and excellent song selection. As a singer, Steve Tyrell sounds a lot like Leon Russell. He conveys his love of these standards and his enthusiasm is infectious. One senses that he is enjoying himself, but in a generous, rather than self-indulgent way. This rendering of 'standards' retains the traditional virtues of these great tunes and also freshens them up. Highly recommended."
5,Tyrell is tops,"I first heard Steve Tyrell's ""The Way You Look Tonight"" in the movie 'Father Of The Bride' and knew that it had to be the song my daughter and I would dance to at her wedding. It was.Much later, I heard Tyrell perform live as the opening act for Linda Ronstadt. He stole the show. His 'gravelly' voice is perfect for the old classic jazz tunes. He makes listening sooo easy ... and better yet, he uses top flight musicians on piano, sax, trumpet, guitar, etc. The musicans performances alone are worth the price of the CD. You can't go wrong with this album or the companion CD by Tyrell, ""A New Standard""."
1,Super low quality poorly made Press Clamp!,"Super low quality, poorly made press screw. The casting was full of porosity and the powder coating was not complete. There was a piece of drill rod welded to the bottom of the press plate then powder coated over.For a few dollars more buy a Jorgensen Press Screw that is made in the USA that has a higher level of quality set at industry level standards.I returned the Shop Fox through Amazon's amazing return process."
4,Not bad.,"The specifications say the shank fitting is 1"" but it is actually a bit larger... so if you are thinking it will fit a 1"" hole think again. Other than that, it works as advertised.Tom"
2,Poor quality.,"I ordered 2 of these. One is OK, but not great. The other was poor quality. The screw threads were rough on one end, the swivel piece on the end that fastens to your platen had flashing inside that caused misalignment. I returned that one.These might be OK for occasional use, but not for regular use."
4,Discovering shark books,"Nancy field has produced an accurate, thoughtful and interesting bookfor kids. A major stumbling block in protecting sharks is their badreputation and the many myths that have sprung up about thesemagnificent predators. Field has written an exciting and factual bookthat will help set the record straight with the most importantpeople-our children!Samuel H. GruberProfessor, Univ. of Miami;Director, Bimini Biological Field Station"
1,Very poor,"I have one recommendation. DO NEVER buy this so called book.I think I could have done it better myself. Not only think...I know I could. The opening is presented with games which are very poorly annotated. You should print out some good games on the Froms gambit from chessbase megadatabase instead of buying this totally worthless ""book"".Eric Schiller has written some books which I like but this one is probably his worse book he will ever write."
5,A Drummers Video,"This is for drummers and percussionists alike. It would really be hard not to enjoy this if you have ever sat behind a set and there are many familiar names to drummers whom know drummers. Never want to say the best - there are not best drummers - but all presented here could be given 10/10s for their performances and their unique style. I've seen Famularo a couple of times live and he does a great job, as expected, here in this video as well. With acts like: Dave Weckl, Grant Collins, and Virgil Donati it is hard to go wrong.Can't believe this is not yet rated. It's a clear 5 Star for a drummer looking to collect some inspirational videos."
1,lousy,"MATHSEMANTICS by the same author was so great, I eagerly bought this one. But it's a bunch of academic tedium. A major let-down."
1,Waste of resources,"This video falls into the same realm as every other project done on John. 90% focuses on who his parents were and him as a child. Do the publishers and producers fail to realize that it is John ""The Sexiest Man Alive"" that we want to see footage of, not of him as a baby running around the White House lawn, or do they just not care?I would have liked to have seen more of John and Carolyn. There were a couple of nice shots of her, when they first met, but the footage is few and far between. Basically, just few. In fact, I would have been happy with a video on just him and Carolyn. The days of John as a baby are overplayed and boring.1 star for not enough adult footage."
1,Amatuer- -?,Maybe it's the thought that counts... a tribute to the son of the president...that's why I gave this video a one star rating. The quality of the video and the music are at best...fair. I'm quite disappointed.
3,Shallow Dive,"If you're looking for a submarine thriller & page-turner, this is it. On the other hand, keep turning the pages and don't take a moment to think, because the novel has very little depth and rather poor military knowledge. For instance, if Mr. Miller would like to be mentioned in the same breath as Clancy etc.,,,he might actually learn the difference between a ""Beretta"" pistol and a fictional TV detective starring Robert Blake. (hmmm...freudian slip maybe?) - or possibly he just has a bad editor, but nevertheless it's just one example from some-one who would like to write credible 'speculative miltary fiction' - but doesn't bother getting his story checked by some of the people 'at the sharp end' before publication.Also, the characterizations all start off pretty well, and then loose themselves along the way.A good 'beach' read......but that's all. My copy will find it's way to the 'used book store' as soon as possible."
2,Third time not so charming,"I've read and enjoyed Miller's previous two books. They were fun, action packed, fast as a bullet, but this one flops.It sounded like a good idea: a nuclear submarine with the crew dying of a mysterious disease, but there are grievous flaws. There's no real villains. The hero is too nice a guy without any edginess or sharpness, and at times the description of technical matters, why and how the sub works, seem just undigested lumps of research. It could have worked: there is at least slightly psycho officer, and some of the crewmen could have gone dangerously wacko; there's a hint of suppressed violence in the hero's background, but it never erupts. The story doesn't grip you or thrill you. Maybe better luck next time."
1,French Style Phone,"Terrible. I ordered this.The company made it very cheap. Mine was always crocked and the hookswitch was never level.It rocked back and forth on the receiver. The company sent me the wrong receiver Twice. it was awful.later on. I got a new phone and I got it from Steinmart. It was a black French style phone and it was reat. Great Receiver, the curved kind I wanted in the first place, and the sound was good and the hookswitch was Straight. It was great and cost about half the price as well.The phone I ordered was from a company from China and it was bloody Terrible.Don't order anything from their webcite on Amazon, you will be dissappointed."
5,Terrific!!!,"I purchased the Danielle Gold Purse Atomizer to fill with some vintage perfume that didn't come in a spray bottle.The only negative was that the perfume flowed out of the funnel as I was trying to fill the atomizer. However, I managed to get the perfume into the atomizer without the funnel and it worked just fine.Great product that serves the purpose perfectly!"
2,There was a bug when I bought it. I cannot play it.,The game is great and all but I am still very disappointed that the game I bought had a bug and it has made it impossible for me to continue in the game.
3,It is a great game but it is Damaged.,So I picked up this game for fun. The game it's self is good I like it but it has a flaw. The cartridge is messed up. No I don't mean it is a fake copy. It is a real copy it's just beaten up. When I got it did not look beaten up at all. I looked like it was in great shape. But by the way it looks some thing is wrong with the chip it's self. IDK but the game works it's just touchy. I don't blame the seller. The seller is a good seller they actually wrapped the game it's self in bubble wrap and then put it in a bubble wrapped envelope. I will say that shows the seller really does care. For that I will be more than happy to buy from the seller again.
5,Takes you back.,"This is awesome, its just like the original which I had blue. This has nothing but the original Pokemon up until you beat the game which I have yet to get there since mine came in Monday. This is a great game for those who want to sit back and enjoy how it all unraveled with Team Rocket and the original gym leaders and elite 4. Great game for those who want to relive the fun."
4,great old time western,"I am an avid fan of almost all western movies, especially to older ones. This selection of tv westerns certainly fits in this category. Similar fans should love these shows."
2,Ruined by poor sound quality.,"For fans of the Golden Age of westerns, this series has it all: interesting story lines, famous actors before they became famous, and an affable host.And it's all ruined by the poor sound quality. As O. Pringle said in his/her review, the sound level is not consistent. You've got to turn the volume way up sometimes to hear the dialog, then a second later turn it down because of the blaring music.And to make matters worse, the audio is often muddled. Sometimes you cannot make out what is being said (at any volume setting).I bought this as a gift for an older relative who has pretty good hearing. She mentioned the audio problem to me, and after watching several episodes I had to agree with her. It's a real shame that the audio could not be improved somehow."
4,Variable sound level,"The video quality is mostly excellent. Stripes in Powell's coat make an odd shimmer on my LCD TV set. But the sound level has extreme variations. At places the highest level possible on my TV is still not enough, at others I must sharply reduce the volume level. I do not know if this is the original sound level or if the production of this set is somehow involved. Today's technology should enable improvement of this problem. I considered giving it just 3 stars. No doubt many viewers of this series will be older people who may have some hearing impairment."
3,Nostalgia ain't what it was,"I saw some of these shows in my childhood but they just aren't what I remembered. As as child I thought they were exciting but seeing them again I realise that they were terribly contrived. There is a certain naive charm about some of the stories and it is sort of interesting to see some actors before they were really famous. Other than that meh! I think nostalgia got the better of me,"
4,Very good,"Excellent system, it's great in the frigid winter of Maine.One thing to note is that the installation cost me $250 more, although I suppose if you were electrically inclined you could do it yourself."
3,Titles don't match tracks,"Apparently 3 more tracks were inserted without updating the track index. I realized this when I played the whip-por-will track and heard a hermit thrush instead. Don't use this CD for field identification unless you can figure out what the 3 extra tracks are and where they were inserted so you can rewrite the track listing accordingly. Otherwise, the recordings are crisp and clear."
4,My Budgie Maude & I love this cd!,I purchased this cd for my budgie to hear & learn different bird sounds during the day while I am @ work....Maude just goes wild when I walk over to turn it on.....she will sit on top of the cd player & bob her head.It will be cool when she starts repeating the different birdsI had no trouble with the track not lineing up but the 3 bonus tracks didnt have a name only unavailable....but Maude can't read so she dont mind
4,bird songs,My cockatiel looks forward to this cd every morning...I also love listening to this CD. It's very relaxing and puts me in a good mood for the remainder of the day
3,Messed up playlist,"I'm not sure if all the versions of this CD have a song list that doesn't match the play list, but mine does. Very confusing if you are a serious birder trying to learn bird calls and songs. I'm giving it three stars instead of one because after you figure out this mistake and rewrite the play list yourself to match the song list, the bird songs are actually very good quality in sound."
3,A Mixed Bag,"This disc contains a number of well-recorded bird songs...but it's the wrong number. The publisher created an incorrect index for this disc and it makes using it rather difficult. If you know what the birds sound like, it's a fine resource, but I haven't figured them all out and I must admit to being a bit frustrated. Perhaps this item should be recategorized under puzzles :-)"
3,Bird Sounds,"Used this with my classroom during March, the bird return moon...My students enjoyed it...but it would have been better with a pictoral accompaniment, so they could identify the bird with the sound...and if it had been regional (we leave in southeast TN)."
3,"Great case, but it's too big!","Another reviewer said that this case, which is tailor-made for the PowerBook 12"", was too big for the PB 12"". I figured that must be a mistake, so I ordered anyway. Well, they were right! The case leaves about a 1""x.75"" strip empty next to a 12"" PB and allows the machine to move around. I left in a strip of the foam that came packed inside to keep it from rattling. I may try the weatherstrip idea from the other review.However, it is a very well constructed case that I expect will last a long time. It's also the only ""hard"" case out there, even though the sides are not fully rigid.I recommend this case if you don't mind the slight size issue. I am a bit dissapointed."
3,Great talents involved; uneven selection,"Walking Tall, by Burt Bacharach and Tim Rice, is the class of the field. It is an unpretentious song, but it is very charming and soulful. I hope to see Lyle Lovett performing it at the Oscars ceremony. 1+1=2 is awfully catchy, and Diane Warren wrote two songs for the CD (3 and 11). The other songs are likely to be of interest only to the younger audience -- in this respect I Need To Know and A Mouse In The House have their appeal. Despite the elaborate production of Diane Warren's two songs, the Bacharach-Rice song sounds more mature (while remaining charming and captivating). Lyle, Trisha and Debelah do an excellent job performing their respective songs."
4,Lucky Day,The music on the soundtrack is very fitting with the movie and after listening to the album a few times I fail to understand why the track Luck Day buy English singer songwriter Matt Goss is not the lead song for the movie. This guys vocal talents are suberb and this song is a very moving ballad that would have summed up the film beautifully. Buy this album today if only to hear the vocal and writing talents of Matt Goss
3,Burt Bacharach-Tim Rice + Lyle Lovett,"Need I say more? Walking Tall, the Bacharach-Rice collaboration, is an unassuming gem wonderfully performed by Lyle Lovett. It probably deserves a nomination from the Academy, and hopefully Amazon.com will include it among the songs with a RealAudio link, as it is ""the class of the field."" (The movie has not yet been released, and the links have not yet been placed.)The CD also includes a few amusing songs, such as Mouse In The House and 1+1=2, and two Diane Warren songs, one performed by Trisha Yearwood, the other performed by Debelah Morgan. Debelah, whom I did not know, shows uncommon talent.The score is by Alan Silvestri."
2,Lovett and McKnight the only redeeming tracks,"I won this CD for answering a trivia question at a sneak preview of Stuart Little...and I still feel like I wasted money. The Lyle Lovett/Bacharach/Rice tune is Fantastic, and the Brian McKnight song is very nice...but the rest is horrific. ""Mouse in the House"" is a joke...and the Lou Bega track is the exact same song as ""Mambo #5"" but in a different key with different words...I'm not joking...It's the exact same progression and melody. Buy this CD only if you are a die hard Lyle Lovett fan (as I am)."
5,This book is awesome!,I would recommend this book to people if they like alphabet books and if they want to know what happens next. The Z was Zapped will leave them something to think about. It gave me funny thoughts. I liked the art work because it was great and I liked the pencil sketchings.
5,We Love the Z was Zapped,"My three boys, who are all in their twenties now, loved this book when they were small. When my youngest was 18 months he recognized the ""T"" and said, ""The T is all tied up!"" We plan to get The Z Was Zapped for the next generation. It's too fun not to!"
5,Fantastic Alphabet Book,"A fantastic, unique alphabet book. I've read this book to preschool aged children many times, and they love it every time."
1,Baby Boo Bah Book,"""The Z was Zapped"" is a very boring book. I you are in Kindergarten, first grade, or second grade or if you are just learning how to read, it can be a good book. If you are older, I give it one star. Please only buy this book for age's 7 and under. In a fourth grader's opinion this book should be named ""The Baby Boo Bah Book."" -Makalia, Fourth Grade, Nantucket, MA"
2,SOS 2.0,"We have been using SOS for three years. We began with the version before 2.0 and were very pleased with it. We would rate it five stars. This year, we purchased History and Chemistry 11th grade 2.0. We were put off immediately when we found that my computer (where it had worked fine before) did not have enough ram, the right windows version, etc. So I installed it on our more up-to-date computer with a minimum of fuss, but when I went to set up the subjects, etc., I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that, instead of making it simpler, it was actually more difficult. I had been working on it for three days and had completed 3/4 of a unit when we found out that the new and improved SOS 'server' was leaking information through our internet. Add the fact that you can no longer simply save your work to a floppy disk-it's too large, and there were several errors (on their part) in the chemistry problem sets, and suffice to say that we weren't happy with this 'new and improved' SOS 2.0. (...)"
3,An interesting book examining political and domestic themes,"Judge on Trial caught my eye because it promised to deliver an interesting exposition of the political situation in Czechoslovakia prior to the 1968 revolution and how that impacts the choices the main character makes. I thought the book was alternately interesting and tedious. The underlying themes of moral dilemmas in the face of political repression were interesting but not explored in an as accessible manner as I had hoped. The domestic situation of the judge was very interesting, but ultimately unsatisfactorilly resolved. Ultimately I did not find the main character compelling as he seemed to distance himself from everything including responsibility for his own actions at times. The novel ended very darkly and while I would recommend this as an interesting book from the standpoint of learning more about East European politics, the story was not as compelling as I initially thought."
5,Amazing total body workout!,"This workout was the next step for me, after I had been doing the introductory Stott Pilates that I got years ago for free with Special K boxtops (Seriously!). I found the intro wasn't challenging me any longer so took the plunge to this level 2 mat workout....No problem being challenged now!!! All you need is a good thick exercise mat & you can do this great conditioning and toning routine...I already see a difference in my body after just a couple of weeks."
5,A great workout,This was my first pilates DVD. I bought it for home practice and love it. Great work outs and suggestions and made my pilates practice outside of class better. Once I learned the routine I was able to make it harder on myself by adding appropriate variations or changing it up.
1,unviewable,"I bought two Stott Pilates dvd's and opened the first, Mat Essentials, and liked it. I used it regularly for a couple of months between classes so didn't open this one, ""Firm and Fit"", until later. As another reviewer found, this has skips and it stops so much that it's unviewable. If you do buy it, be sure to watch it all the way through soon after your purchase so you can return it within the 30 days required by Amazon. I seem to have wasted my money in this case!"
1,Stott Pilates-Fit and Firm,Both of the Pilates DVD's I bought from Amazon skipped horribly. I am totally disatisfied with them!
3,Great for a quick lunch,"I enjoyed this mixture for a quick lunch with a poached egg on top - made it a bit more savory and I didn't mind that it wasn't more spicy. The individual who found that the rice was undercooked probably didn't wait the 4 minutes for the rice to sit after the second cooking time period. All in all, not bad!"
2,Not spicy and the rice was undercooked,"Indian food is one of my favorite cuisines. I did not like this however. It is not spicy and too sweet. On my first attempt, following the directions on the packet in my 1300 watt microwave, the rice was undercooked and needed more time. I haven't bothered to try it again because I didn't enjoy it. I prefer the Taste of Thai Coconut Ginger and Peanut from the same company."
2,Not enough Chee-Yun,"When I bought this CD, after hearing Chee-Yun at an NSO concert, I was looking forward to hearing more of her. Instead, the CD had too much of the pianist who accompanied her."
3,Disappointing accompanyment,"Chee-Yun is another Sarah Chang, Midori, etc., but unless accompanied by the orchestra, on this CD the piano-violin combination is disappointing as is the sound quality."
5,Have skin problems? Try This.,"My experience with the Herbal Logix product line began with the blemish and scar creme. I was impressed with the results of that product and tried the Grape Seed Scrub. Now, I have eczema and have tried many, many products. I had a patch on the side of my face when I began using the scrub, and it is pretty much gone now. Anyone who has problems with eczema knows how hard it is to control (there is no cure). I now use this product on my entire body, not just my face. Well worth the price."
3,Sorry but not one of his best works ..,"thats for sure cause this author KNOWS erotica ....The book deals with a mythical land and a powerfull king, Rahn, who rules with a firm hand generally rapoing and pillaging those who do not pay him homage. He has a large harmen populated generally by the wives and daughters of deposed kings and war lords.We really don't see the 'Ice Queen' until the middle of the book and even then she really doesn't capture the reader's attention appart from being just another one of the kings' women.Actually that is really the problem, we can't identify with the king or many of the other characters including the confidant of the king who ia actually telling the story of the Fall of the Ice Queen .....I gave it 3 stars but really only out of respect for the author since this one is probably a stinker ...."
1,another movie with good reviews? your kidding i hope?,"i should have known that when you watch somethin from full moon your going to get full moon quality. terrible movie, simply terrible. 5 hot girls go into a house to have a chance to win a million dollars. all they have to do is complete the challenges laid in front of them by the director who is putting the show on tv. only thing is that the house is really haunted and all hell breaks loose, ya right! sounds like a good movie but it's really not. not entertaining one bit. move on and check out somethin else. really wish i could give this movie less than 1 star."
2,2 stars for guts,"I am giving this loser 2 stars because of the guts of everyone who worked on this stinker to put there name on it.If I saw any of these people in public I would encourage a good old lynching.There is not one level this movie is not bad on,except one.THE END,that was the only good thing about it.I paid one cent for this,and that was to much."
1,Worst product EVER,"This product is HORRIBLE! It was super tight on the mattress for starters and the pad didnt even cover the entire surface. Second and most importantly, there is NO ELASTIC on the sides. So I ended up ripping it the first time I put it on. TOTAL WASTE! DONT BUY!!"
5,Rockin' Fun!,"So, I began my PCC lifestyle by seeing the band play at a local coffee shop late one winter evening and they were awesome. I bought this C.D. All clad in leprechaun green; there was even a saw player to finnish the group. Aside for having some very unique instruments the music they produce is an absolute blast and great music to drive to, or show off to friends. The album morphs through such phases that it will lift you out of any mood and make you happy. Definitely. a must for any indie rock enthusiast."
2,Tiny,"This claw ring is smaller than i imagined. Its fairly sharp and looks fantastic, but its much too small to fit any of my fingers except my pinky. (although, it DOSE have bendable band-like things on the bottom that you can bend to your finger, but it will barely hold it.)"
1,OUTRAGEOUS PRICE,THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS PRICE FOR THIS ITEM. STORES ETC ARE OUT OF THIS ITEM HOWEVER WHEN IN STOCK THEY ARE UNDER $20. WHAT MAKES THIS YEAR SO SPECIAL IT IS AT SUCH A HIGH PRICE? CERTAINLY NOT BECAUSE ITS A POPULAR YEAR I HOPE.
4,creative butterfly,"I found catatonia by fate. My friend was showing me his napzoo and for no other reason than chance, he accidentally played ""she's a millionaire"". I was instantly blown away. I had rarely heard such creativity in a rock band and cerys' voice left me utterly captivated. I immediately bought their ""equally cursed and blessed"" album and was further left speechless by their songs like ""bulimic beats"" and ""karaoke queen"". The creativity that they show in some of their songs are are matched only by artists like Beck and Bjork. I can tell that they are only beginning to stretch out their arms of experimentation though, because songs like ""road rage"" and ""mulder and scully"" are rather generic hits. Over all however, I believe they are just cacooning, and in the end, will spawn into a creative butterfly that will flutter brilliance in the rock scene."
4,What A Voice,"Cerys Matthews has one of the most distintive voices that i have ever heard. Equally Cursed and Blessed is Catatonias third studio album and their most accomplised to date. Containing the Uk hit singles, Road Rage, Dead From The Waist Down, Mulder And Scully, Londinium and Karaoke queen its easy to see why Catatonia has amased a huge fan base in such a small time. Lets hope that on the next album Cerys can keep up the good work and write good songs as singable as Road Rage"
4,Good but not as good as I expected,"Actually, I've got british's LP version of this album.. The latest album contains some catchy pop tune such as Karaoke Queen, Death from the Waist Down, and Londinium. However this album is not as good as an overlook ""International Velvet"""
3,in between,"road rage was the first catatonia song I heard, after it was released in the UK, and it is the best song on the album. dead from the waist down is okay, but the rest isn't very good. I'd buy the road rage single, because it will be stuck in your head ."
1,GARBAGE,"This CD is pure trash. For some REALLY good music, check out the band Katatonia spelled with a ""K"" instead of a ""C"". Now THAT is some beautiful music."
4,"Good, but get ahold of their previous two albums","I bought Equally Cursed and Blessed in the UK nearly a year ago. It's interesting that it was (just) released in the US with two extra tracks - very good ones - from their previous release International Velvet, which I feel is a superior album. I like the band's sound. Cerys has an oustanding voice, and the rockier songs are as good, maybe slightly better, than their ballads. Also, one has to be impressed with their lyrics; there are some really clever lines. Nevertheless, EC&B has its good moments and its not-so-good, and I find the album fairly uneven, especially after having long-admired International Velvet and their first album, Way Beyond Blue, both of which are must-haves. It's doubtful they'll experience success here; they certainly won't replicate the considerable success they have in the UK, and I doubt they even care: their anti-American stance has been pretty well documented. In any event, I'll just appreciate their music from afar."
4,Great CD with some catchy lyrics and songs,"This CD is quite good, and very innovative in its sound. The lyrics and sounds are very catchy and combine quite well together. The vocals are definitely intersting and different from most standard female vocals even if they do get a little screechy at times. It starts off with the great song ""Dead from the Waist Down"" which is an interesting song even if the lyric about ""Making hay"" seems a little corny. ""Londinium"", and ""Karaoke Queen"" are also quite good, but I think the best songs are ""Road Rage"" and ""Mulder and Scully"" which I understand are actually from the International Velvet album and thus I am going to try and find that CD next. Overall if you want an innovative sound try this CD."
5,Park It Here 2000,Great book - I will recommend it to all my friends spending time in New York. Very helpful information and easy to use.
3,A little drawn out,I found it a little too drawn out. Not sure that I would pursue the rest of the series on this one.
1,"Unfortunately, I just couldn't get into it","I had to put this down after only 10 pages or so. I found Cherryh's writing style to be difficult to follow, with many unpronounceable names and rambling paragraphs. I know this is one of the ""classics"" of fantasy, but it just wasn't my cup of tea."
4,Four Out of Five,"One of the discs seems to be blank. The others all work fine. Errol Flynn is one of my favorite all-time actors. This is the second of three collections I have purchased. I love that they include the complete movie experience with the shorts, cartoon, coming attraction, etc."
4,Great Set !! Looking Forward To Vol. 3,"A great set and a must have for Flynn fans. Highlights for me are ""The Dawn Patrol & Gentleman Jim."" I am looking forward to Vol. 3.Here are my picks for Vol.3:Another DawnDesperate JourneyEdge Of DarknessNorthren PursuitUncertain Glory"
1,Extremely ignorant,"The author does a disservice to any message about oil and gas depletion he is trying to convey. In particular, his ignorant views about the Middle East, that came at the end of the book, discredit everything that preceded them. This leads one to believe his views on oil and gas depletion are extremely biased.For a book that portends to treat the subject scientifically, it was anything but scientific in its analysis of the subject."
1,Essence of Oil & Gas Depletion: Collected Papers and Excerpt,"The author needs to get back onto his medication. He does the issue a great injury by raving in an extremist and highly self centered manner. A much better book on this important subject is Hubbert's Peak, The impending world oil shortage by Kenneth S. Deffeyes."
2,Don't buy it,"Ok. The guitar players are good. But there is so much extra noise such as heavy breathing, the guitarist moving around etc. in many of the pieces. I am only somewhat being humerous when I say I am suprised you don't hear the guitarist belching or passing gas! It is a very, very irritating recording of good guitarists."
1,"PLEASE NOTE:""How to Pick Your Personal Lottery Numbers"",NOT, ""How to Pick Your Winning Personal Lottery Numbers"".","I bought my copy second hand,for a few bucks,and if you really want to read this book,then I would suggest you do the same (I see it's for sale on the author's website for $50.95,at the time of writing this review).I would suggest picking your own numbers intuitively yourself,rather than relying on the comical methods concocted for this book.And notice once more that the book is called -""How to Pick Your Personal Lottery Numbers"",NOT,""How to Pick Your Winning Personal Lottery Numbers""...and that's for a reason,because the methods outlined in this book are no better than picking them from a hat.Oh...and good luck...because you will need it.-)"
2,Good Topic - VERY OUTDATED MATERIAL,"The Topic is good, however the ""book"" is extremely disappointing. First, it states here that the book is paperback. I guess in the strictest sense that is true... however I was quite taken back when I ordered it here from Amazon.com - and received about 70 Xeroxed pages stapled together. Hardly what I expected for a ""paperback"". Getting past that, the material although relavent, is extremely outdated. If you want to build a high-end golf cart this might help. But if you want to delve into something modern (circa 2007) you won't find it here.I'm sorry to sound so harse but it is the truth. I'm also sorry to say: Shame on Amazon... you shouldn't advertise this as a ""paperback"" when you're really selling what amounts to a handful of photocopied pages."
3,"Dated, but still worth the read","Nice technical data, but some of the ideas need to be updated for the next generation of home built and home converted. Would LOVE to see an update that adds some of the newer battery and hybrid ideas that are becoming more realistic for consumers."
2,Interesting but old material.,The book is somewhat interesting but the information in the book is old.Information of engines and batteries was not up to date.In my copy the pages was not in order (page 41 was followed by 40 the next was 42 and so on).As I understand it the book was an icon when it came but now I'm sure there are better books.
5,Convert It,Excellent book! Anyone wanting to convert a gas using vehicle to electric will benefit by reading this book. The warnings are especially helpful if you want to protect yourself from harm's way and avoid serious errors in tearing down and rebuilding your electric vehicle.
1,Less informative than my first Web Search,"I bought this book and a couple others looking for more in depth information on converting a gas vehicle to an electric. This book had less information than the first few hits on my original internet query for electric conversions. Its out of date, and lacks any sort of real specifics on what to consider when converting, or how to quantify the various factors.Save your money! There are much better resources out there!"
2,"BEWARE! - Outdated, expensive information","I tried to order this book first from the copyright holder and authors, Electro Automotive. After I sent off my order, I e-mailed a question about the resources here in Hawaii. Whether anyone has converted a vehicle here using their components, etc. No answer.After a 2 month wait my check wasn't cashed and no book arrived. Nada. Guess they don't want to do business.So, being a glutton for punishment I ordered Convert It from Amazon @ $24,95. MISTAKE. I didn't read far enough into the reviews to see how outdated it was, 19 years outdated. While some of the basics may still hold, the components surely have improved with time.So, I can't recommend it for anything but basic, basics...and not for the price. And, by all means, beware of Electo Automotive."
3,convert it manual,"This book offers some good insight into what's required in converting an automobile from gas to electric. It was, however, published in the 90's and should be updated."
5,convert it,author michael p. brown says this book is a step by step of what is involved in converting a petrol to electric and that is exactly what you get for a novice ev converter its all you will need --- bar a lot of motivation
4,Mystery Lovers Rejoice,"Having run out of British mysteries, I decided to try this Swedish production. The plots were surprisingly easy to follow with excellent, highly visible subtitles. The pacing is somewhat slow and measured but this helps to keep the viewer on track. The characters are varied but not spectacularly different than those from other crime dramas. The acting is very good and I ordered the next set of DVDs."
5,I'm So Glad,"This is a very inspirational album it has a very profound message thru the whole album but this song is very special to me being I used this in my wedding vows to my Husband so I want to thank Jamie Jones for the great inspiration he has given me thru his music!!!!! Keep up the great work.North Hollywood, CATrina Ford Burfford"
1,Really boring,I purchased this book because it has a four star rating. Imagine my disappointment when I finally managed to finish it.It is the most boring book I have ever read. I am an avid reader. In my mental list of five worst books I have ever had the misfortune to read this one will go to the top.There is no plot and the characters are pathetic. So a word of warning. Have something else on hand to read in-between so you don't die of boredom.
1,Don't waste your money here,"Please read this carefully. I purchased this item a few years ago. What the customer does not realize is that this dummy is not 100% soft material. The black areas are hard PLASTIC! The blue area is not very soft or pliable. The material they used on this product is cheap and inferior. The hard plastic is NOT ACCEPTABLE for a martial arts/fitness training equipment. Yes they provide you with gloves, however, anyone who purchases an item such as this would expect the equipment to be made of appropriate material - which this is not."
1,THIS PRODUCT IS NO ORIGINAL,THE FRAGANCE IN THIS PRODUCT NO IS DURABLE. I DONT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER FOR A FUTURE BUY.
3,Redeemed...My Soul Has Been Redeemed,"The choir songs are good... They take you back to a time when choirs .... ""sang"" A nice compilation of work done by Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. The downside of this recording is that the audio quality and levels is so terribly done when they converted it from record to digital. Unless you turn your stereo or mp3 player up really high, you cannot determine what the vocalists are saying."
1,very weak reception on SW band,"I bought the radio in December 2010. On Jan. 2011 took it with me on an oversea trip. Tried to use the SW band but unable to pick up the stations that I wanted to listen to. Tried to return it but past the 30-day return policy, EE doesn't want to take it back. I had an old Sony SW that I used at the same location and sound/reception quality was excellent."
4,Good but not perfect,"This is a nice little world radio, but it is not perfect. Sound quality on AM/SW is pretty poor. Sound quality on FM is fine. I get a motorboating sound on 800 khz when the backlight comes on and on 790 khz when it is off. This is very annoying. I have only used it on AM and it seems pretty sensitive, but not very selective close to local channels. Battery life is only about 4 hours, but I guess that is acceptable. Despite its problems, I really like this little receiver and think it is worth the price."
2,Poor manufacturing,"I have this radio for about a month. As a radio, it is much better than Grundig G6 Aviator and Eton 100 (that I also own). Unfortunately, it seems that manufacturing quality is pretty poor: after about a month of use the radio started having problems with the keyboard. It is necessary to press some buttons twice or more, with force. Pressing ""power"" to switch the radio on sometimes switches it on for a second and swithes it immediately off. Pressing some keys causes loud ""click"" noise in the speaker.Manual is EXTREMELLY poor and confusing. It cannot be dwnloaded from manufacturer's page. Make few copies and save. If manual is lost, you are lost :)Month later, March 9th, 2011. It is harder and harder to switch the radio on or off. Most frequently, pressing the Power button switches the radio on for a second and switches it immediately off. It seems that even for something that cost 60 bucks it is deteriorating too rapidly..."
2,Couldn't understand how it worked.,"Even after reading the instructions, I was completely baffled as to how to get it to work. Have barely used it. If you're not a hardcore tech-y person, look for something with an easy to use interface. I simply didn't have the patience."
4,A great snack!,"I love these and will buy again. They're sweet without being too sweet and very healthy. They do taste a tiny bit fiberous, but that's because it's mostly apple, and who couldn't use a bit more fiber anyway?"
3,Not the best I've had,These tasted dry to me. Not soft like others have commented. My kids will eat them but they and I prefer Trader Joe's Fiberful and Simply Fruit Rollups although the later does not have as much fiber.
2,Not very tastey,"I am sure the product is good for you-- but I did not find this good tasting at all. I was expecting a ""typical"" fruit leather... this had much less taste and a worse texture."
4,"I prefer other fruit leathers for myself, but this is the best for little ones","The flavor is good. I don't prefer the texture which is soft rather than leathery. My older kids prefer Stretch Island, however, my 2 year old loves these. Other fruit leathers are hard for her to chew, but these are soft enough she could eat them easily."
5,complete book,"I write from Mexico. I am very pleased with this book, it contains lots of images and easy explanations. And the price is really good. Strongly recommended. Amazon's delivery time very fast.Thank you"
4,good workouts especially for intermediates,"Make no mistake, these workouts are tough at times. However they are more suitable for 40 plus excercisers,with low impact muscle- building moves. All are about 40-45 minutes in length and highly recommended. I much prefer these over the more recent Firm workouts,which are highly commercialized with a bunch of ""Stepford babes""."
4,tough workout,These are great work out tapes - simply effective moves without a lot of jumping and bouncing.
4,Australian Jazz Band plays Bix,"This jazz band from Australia ""New Wolverine Jazz Orchestra"" plays the music of Bix Beiderbecke. The group produces their own transcriptions of arrangements from original classic recordings of the 1920s and 1930s wherever possible, and playing them on vintage instruments.This recording celebrates jazz on and along the mighty Mississippi River, from New Orleans up to the Upper Mississippi with seldom heard pieces that are real gems. I have heard this band live several times and highly recommend their work. They are lively as well as accurate in their interpretation of Bix style jazz. There are also nice write ups about the history of the selections with the cd. Thumbs up!"
5,These women are awesome,I have to tell you that these ladies stories are compelling and wonderful. Parents and young women should watch this together. Thanks to all.
5,Funny look inside this great family,"This book was really a fun read. For parents (especially dads) who hope to have a big family, it's really great to get this peak inside and hear from a man who's walking the walk. There aren't a lot of role models for Christian dads these days, but Rick Boyer is definitley on the list."
1,This game sucks!,"I swear this is easily one of the worst games I've ever played and the worst PSP game I have played so far. Granted every Star Trek game I've ever played have been very poor games. So I can't say I was all that surprised. Why can't anyone make a decent Star Trek game?Do not buy this game unless you are a hopeless Star Trek fanboy/girl who lives in their parents basement and can't buy a date. Yes, the game really is that bad. Just a crappy shooter set in the Star Trek Universe. Taking your $20, rolling it up and smoking it would be more fun than playing this game."
2,Waste of Money,"I don't like long reviews, so I'll keep it short. This game is poorly put together and simply not fun to play. Please don't waste your money."
4,Better than NOT bad,"This game is pretty good..I like it WAY better than ""Encounters"" for the PS2...THAT game had TRUE clunky controls...It IS sort of a hybrid between Starfleet command and Starfleet/Klingon Academy...Most of the complaints seem to be complaining about things that could ONLY be fixed if the game was on a computer, not a HANDHELD....I like it alot...missions are challenging and the cheats for unlockables come in REAL handy!!TOO bad either SONY or Bethesda/Quicksilver decided NOT to allow modding of the game AFTER 5 or so were ALREADY introduced!!!Whats up with that...Good game Good star trek game..Hope they make another!!"
3,"Great Graphics and Concept, But...","... same old mistakes.It's fun! If you like Star Trek, add a star here or there. But they get the same thing wrong that all the others do, these are supposed to be BIG Star Ships. You can't ""Dog Fight"" in a ship like this, they should be huge, lumbering ships that turn slowly... SFC is the closest thing to getting it right so far."
4,ST Fan,It is a hard game and all but if you are a true ST fan you will appreciate it. If your not that much into ST I would prob pass on this unless it's -5$.
3,A cute movie,"not what I expected but cute. You know the kind of movie that you have watched several times and can not recall what the movie is about? Well, this is one of those movies. Fun to watch but forgetable"
5,Success is not an accident,"If you're in sales or are interested in gaining a better understanding of sales, I highly recommend this book. Quite a value for a mere $12 and the time it takes to read 200 pages of excellent advice interspersed with amusing anecdotes, useful axioms, and real-world examples of ""Accidental Sales Training Seminars"".I've been involved with sales and marketing in the technology industry for over 10 years. Over that time, I have read many books, participated in countless training sessions, and attended a wide variety of seminars in an ongoing effort to improve my performance, increase my income, and service my clients in a professional manner. I bought ""The Accidental Salesperson"" simply because of the intriguing title. I've since read it several times, referred to it continually, and recommended it to many colleagues."
1,Worthless on a Kendle,This seems like a good book but it is worthless to try to read it on a Kendle. The entire book is based on a sales carts. Most of the chapters focus on different aspects of these charts.The problem is that the chart is reproduced on the Kendle too small to ever be able to read by the human eye. Changing the font size does not affect the size of the charts.Do not order this book to be read on your Kendle!The Accidental Salesperson: How to Take Control of Your Sales Career and Earn the Respect and Income You Deserve
5,The Accidental Salesperson,"There are many ""sales"" books on the market today. Few are as good as this one. I'll point out three ad-hoc bullet points that combined make for a very productive and educational read:1) Because a Major League second baseman might be a great hitter, fielder, and baserunner, does that make him a good team manager? That is a very important point of this book. Because someone is a terrific salesperson, he gets promoted away from doing what he really does well to become a manager. Not necessarily a good move.2) The book is very motivational. As you read it, ideas pop into your head as to how it's annecdotes apply to your business. I found myself scribbling away with new thoughts that I'm excited to implement.3) The book is NOT vague. There are very many specific paths and actions to take. No one can read this and not find unique suggestions that can be applied to YOUR business.I own two enterprises. Both will be affected by my reading of this book."
4,Doing It Better and On Purpose,"The Accidental Salesperson is an eye opener. After reading it, I not only want to do it better and on purpose, but I want to do business with people who want to do it better and on purpose. I can name 3 people I spend money with because they are level 3 and 4 salespeople. If you want your sales team to become a sales FORCE, read this book."
5,Finally a Book That Delivers What It Promised- SALES!,"The first time I read Accidental Salesperson was Great... the second time was even better.It is nice to find out that you were doing Something right, it's A key to Success to learn something that helps you improve by leaps and bounds. Chris Lytle and Accidental Salesperson is an accentual blue print perfect for the beginning salesperson to start off right. For the salesperson that is seemingly going no where this master piece sets you in the right direction. Sales Professionals get sound caching and a wealth of ""WOW! I never looked at it like that before.""I am so impressed I always keep a couple of extra copies of Accidental Salesperson on had to loan out. I let a friend read my first book and I never got it back.Thanks, Chris, for the Chart. We can ""Take It To The Next Level"" because now we know what it looks like!"
5,Blastoff!!,This is a fantastic book for those looking for fresh ideas or are new to sales. I finished it in a week and started reading it again as a way to ingrain the ideas and process in my head. I found the information straight to the point and filled with common sense. It is easy to follow the process with plenty of reinforcement to back up the statements. I have taken these ideas and are putting them to use. It is exciting to finally find something that clicks with my style of selling. No pressure just a step by step plan to increase your sales and income. I highly recommend this book.
5,Mandatory Reading!,"I've read dozens of sales textbooks over the years, and without a doubt, this is the single best one I've found in years! Chris Lytle writes with that rare blend of knowledge and passion, that it's literally hard to put the book down. His approach to sales is ""systems,"" vs. rah-rah..and the book will give you very real, and ACTIONABLE steps to take right now, to start selling more. It's the kind of book you'd want college students to read, so that they could go into sales in a positive way, rather than ""accidentally,"" as they ""find themselves."" Read this book! Twice!!"
1,Someone Needed Tenure - The Worst Book I Ever Got on Amazon,"I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I feel the need to steer people away from spending money on this book! This was a horrible waste of money, and of time spent in reading the first third or so I read before I quit. Patricia Gunn Allen is not simply hooked on Political Correctness (which I could deal with). She substitutes it for decent scholarship and for writing ability. After the pointless detours into the legends of her own New Mexico Native American clan and 21st Century Physics, the attempt to relate the ""myth"" of Pochahontas to the Legend of one of the Kngihts of the Round Table (I think it was Gawain and the Green Knight, but I'm honestly not sure) did me in. I wanted to know something about Pocahotas -- the Woman! Or, as the title of the book says, the Medicine Woman, Spy, Entrepeneur and Diplomat! And that is what I could NOT glean from this book at all."
1,Shaky grasp of the facts,"I hope her knowledge of American Indian culture is sounder than her grasp of English history. I spotted some howlers, several repeated in the text: King James ""VII"" of Scotland (make that James VI) was NOT Queen Elizabeth's nephew. Nor was Queen Elizabeth England's first Protestant monarch (the honours go to her brother Edward VI)I could go on, but you get the idea ... Read this one with a heaping tablespoonful of salt"
1,Poorly written...interesting material rendered boring,"The feeling the book gave me was one of disjointed-ness, I couldn't fully submerge myself into the book because it didn't seem like the writer could decide how she wanted to present the material. It read like conjecture for a lot of it, with ""could"", ""would have"" , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor, at the same time, it was too conversational, and in all just poorly written. The material was interesting enough, and her conjectures intriguing, it was just the presentation that was faulty. It would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures, as it is...she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel, and it would have carried better."
5,Honest answers to hard questions,"If you're interested in getting and staying lean, fit and healthy longterm, you need more than a one size fits all quick fix diet, magic pills and empty promises.David has created a life empowering program that works for anyone willing to work it.Great book, highly recommended."
5,Two thumbs up!,"To put it simply, this is the most effective program I have EVER encountered. If you are looking for a quick fix, or the next diet pill, you're in the wrong place. If you are sick and tired of going from diet to diet to diet, and want a long-term and healthy way to control your weight once and for all, look no further. This book covers virtually every detail of weight control; from the nuts and bolts of weight loss and maintenance, to the equally important, but often overlooked, emotional issues that come with it. From my own experience, I no longer need to look anywhere else."
4,Get results like the Body-for-LIFE champions...,"If you want to take Body-for-LIFE to the next level or get detailed information about why you haven't been able to achieve results like the champions, this book is a very detailed and meticulous instruction guide that outlines the steps you must take to get super fit.The principles of this book are based on nutrition, training and mental fortitude:- A basic bodybuilder's diet that creates a caloric deficit (30-40% Protein + 45-55% Carb + 15-20% Fat)- Periodization resistance training + Cardio- And of course: Desire.Many of the testimonials are overdone by the ""Club Lifestylers"" which any smart person can spot. (HINT: 5 stars, clusters of review dates...) Weight loss is never permanent. You will have to work hard to get and stay lean and muscular - it's a lifestyle. However, this book serves as a good guide if you want to know what it takes to get lean and/or prepare for a bodybuilding contest."
1,"Almost bought this book, but...regarding the reviews...","Wow, amazing how all the positive reviews for this book are in such a close proximity to one another. They also all sound like they were written by the same person - have very similar comments, format, mentionings, etc.Be very cautions about this. If this book were so great, we'd have heard about it long ago. I recommend ""Body for Life"" by Bill Phillips in place of this Leanness Lifestyle. His newer books, ""Transformation"" is not the exercise prescription that ""Body for Life"" was/is."
5,Fantastic!,This is a tender and sensual romance. The writing is wonderful as well.I recommend it highly.
5,This is one hot erotic novel. I stayed turned on throughout!!,"This is one hot little book. This is a gay man's fantasy! There is so much man on man stuff going on, it was ""hard"" to put down. This book kept me excited throughout! The arousal factor is pretty high. I would love to find more hot man on man books like this! Tom Kvaale knows his stuff. Its proven in 156 pages between the two covers. Sizzling and graphic. Just like we gay guys like 'em. :P"
5,"Book is the basis for the film ""Best Years of our Lives""","My mom's favorite film is ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". The book on which it is based is ""Glory for Me"" which has been out of print for something like 50 years. So I was thrilled to be able to find an old copy on Amazon. I gave it to her without telling her why. The minute she read the first page she was able to identify the characters and it was a nice way to experience the story anew. Great service. Thanks."
5,Must see!,"I heard about the release when I was in Vietnam, about 1998. There's no way to order these kind of films or books in a Communist regime. I could only read the narrative of 20 episodes from CNN website. I bought the film as soon as I reached Singapore.It's very objective to me, not a kind of propaganda. I could listen to A LOT of people from both sides of the battle line. Very vivid!A must see documentary film!"
3,It takes some getting used to,"The foam was a lot harder than expected so that when I first started using it, in actually caused more pain in my wrist. However, over time it does seem to soften a bit, or maybe I just got used to it. Either way, I'm still using it, but be prepared in the beginning to how long it takes to get used to it!"
1,Deceitful Advertising,"The actual product is fine - but this advertisement is deceiving!The picture implies that you will receive a mousepad and a keyboard wrist-rest. And nothing on the page actually calls out the fact that the keyboard wrist-rest pictured is not included!I got my shipment today. Luckily, all I really needed was the mousepad... but I did think it would be a bonus to receive the keyboard rest, too.Disappointed, Amazon. Disappointed."
4,"Clever, thoughtful and most importantly, hilarious","For several days upon completing this book, I found myself laughing uncontrollably at the memory of certain passages. Does this book poke fun at Mathew's strategies as an Oulipian? We don't know. We just have to laugh and pity the character's obsession with order and structure. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in observing how we write, think and react to a crisis."
3,"Nice Bag, Wrong Size","For the price, this is a nice bag but be aware the actual size is 11x9.75x6. I wanted to use it to transport my folder for work--no dice! I returned the item--no hassle at Amazon and they even paid for shipment back! Doesn't get better than this!!"
4,Charming tale!,"A warmly told tale, simple and affectionate, by a woman who plainly loves both her birds and her gardens. My mother is a gardener, and comes from the same region of NY State. When I shared these stories with her, she was very pleased with them. We have since shared them with several other family members, who have all loved them. The beautiful photo illustrations really add to the pleasure, too."
1,Character?,"Reagan certainly had admirable character traits, but this book turns a blind eye to his obvious lapses in character -- from personal issues, such as his divorce and indifferent parenting, to political ones, such as his administration's countless scandals and his own dissembling in the Iran-Contra fiasco. A true look at presidential character would take in the bad as well as the good."
2,A presidential scholar,"Ronald Reagan restored a sense of pride in America after Watergate and the ho-hum administrations of Ford and Carter. He made us proud to be Americans as he dipped into our pockets with his Reaganomics. George Bush, while campaigning against Reagan in 1980 called Reagan's economic policies ""voodoo economics"". Maybe he was on to something. During the Reagan-Bush years we had the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression. We had more banks fail than at any time except the Great Depression. The crime rate was up the budget deficit was the highest ever. The trade deficit was the highest it has ever been. Yes, Reagan was a great president if all this is great. Reagan's charisma sold us a bill of goods except on patriotism to the point of jingoism and if you believe they tore down the Berlin Wall because he told Gorbechev to tear it down I have a bridge for sale."
1,Before spin had a name-,"Interesting to a point. The inside information does add a nice new facet to what we know of RR. But the unabashed love fest of the life and ""character"" of RR gets sickening. It is amazing to me that any reviwer could read more than one account of RR's life and still think he was an exemplar of character. OTOH, it makes sense if you work for him, and are secretly (or not so secretly as the case may be) in love with him. You might think seeing his crook friends would clue one in, figuring that one who has friends who are crooks would most likely be a crook himself. But, that doesn't seem to be the accepted viewpoint. His character must be due to spin, since it cannot be shown by actual evidence. Goodness, if muddy thinking and lying are what we are all supposed to aspire to, I am afraid for the future of the country."
2,Makes Reagan seem too wimpy,"Peggy Noonam probably means well, but she makes Reagan out to be rather soft. Reagan was a good man, and he wasn't the kind of person who let laws get in his way. That's why we elected him. Carter was about as goodie-two-shoes as you can get. Carter was nothing *but* character. That was the problem.Reagan had a dark side and that is *why* he was great. Reagan could be calculating: he was a pretty pro-choice as Governor of California, but he Mr. Pro-life when he ran for President. Why? Any republican who wants to be Gov of California had better be liberal on social issues (like Arnold) but no pro-choice Republican will ever win the primaries.Give Reagan his due. He led our country against the commies and he didn't let ""character"" get in the way of winning. He didn't let ""character"" get in the way of funding the Contras against the communist foothold in Nicaragua. For God, for country, but not some mommas boy who always told the truth. That was the real Reagan."
1,Peggy Noonan is a wica,"Peggy Noonan conjures up an illusion for her readers of a Ronald Reagan who exhibited ""unparalleled integrity."" What about the hushed up rape allegations? The divorce? The abandoned children from the first marriage? The secret deal with Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran to prolong the captivity of Americans, which ensured that Reagan would win the Presidency? The illegal diversion of funds known as ""Iran-Contra?"" Her book might more aptly be called, ""When Character Was Twisted."""
4,A Stirring Tribute to a Great Leader,"I agree 100% with the other reviewers who have praised this book. Peggy Noonan's book serves as a concise but relatively thorough biography of Reagan, an informative explanation of the influences that guided his decisions before and during his political career, and a spirited and insightful defense of some of Reagan's controversial actions (controversial, at least, to those who Reagan called ""our liberal friends"" who ""know so many things that are not so""). Plenty of funny, enlightening, and touching anecdotes help to make this a great tribute to one of our Nation's greatest leaders."
2,Not true to Reagan,"Let's get this straight: I voted for Reagan both times, but not because of his 'character'. I voted for him because he got the job done at any cost. If I wanted 'character' I would have voted for Carter! Carter honesty got us into too many messes, remember? Reagan was a 'do it his way' kind of guy. That's why we liked him!Noonan tries to re-invent Reagan as a simple, honest guy. Sweet, but not true. Reagan brought in tough guys who got it done. More of his people went to prison than any other President. Nixon and Clinton put together had fewer convictions of senior officials. But you know what? Ron brought down the Soviet Union and he got America on it's feet. And if he broke a few laws doing it, we didn't care.That's the real Ron Reagan we should honor. Not this make believe cozy Grandpa from Noonan's weird dreams."
1,Style over Substance,"Peggy Noonan is clearly a gifted writer, but a horrible historian. This book is an unthinking and uncritical work of near-sighted hero worship. Anyone who simply wants to be told that Ronald Reagan walked on water and cured the lame will certainly enjoy this book. But anyone interested in a more balanced, and more thoughtful, account of the Reagan years should check out Lou Cannon's Role of a Lifetime"
5,The Greatest President of the USA,"This book is an excellant book to read if you are a Democrat or a Republican, whether you know Reagan was the greatest president or not. Peggy Noonan covers his life from facts, personal interviews from Reagan's family, friends,collegues (including George Bush junior) and also her personal accounts. And after reading this book, I wish to see another President with character as great as Reagan's."
5,When Character Was King by Peggy Noonan,"I've read a lot of books about Ronald Reagan. For pure reading pleasure this one just might surpass them all. Noonan is a gifted writer, is politically astute, and was a participant in some of the events she writes about. She went from being not too sure about Reagan to being a great admirer. She doesn't sugarcoat him, exploring some of his weaknesses and failures as well as his considerable strengths and political achievements.Reagan was an interesting and an exceptionally optimistic man. He knew what he believed and why, and most of all, he embraced the values of freedom and initiative. He was a leader of the first rank.I like Noonan's writing in this work and others, so I highly recommend this book."
4,Bring him back,"This book will make you long for the days of Reagan. Written with a light hand that doesn't get bogged down in heavy political debate, it's more a high-level summary of why Reagan was great. I could have done with more depth on Reagan's philosophy, but it is pretty clear that this book isn't trying to do that."
2,can't believe it,"Peggy Noonan's ode to Reagan is well written and she is welcome to her opinion, but I feel myself on the opposite side of her ""facts"".I don't to understand why some people say, ""even those who disagree with Mr. Reagan, had to like and respect him"".????? No one that I know liked him. He was a dishonest man and a terrible president and did nothing to help most Americans. His supply side economics were a disaster, there was Iran Contra, etc. etc. and Bush is now trying to keep the Reagan papers from the public. Something to hide? Read Haynes Johnson's ""Sleepwalking Through History"" for the true story."
1,Wow - good and bad,"Wow. This is so magnificently written. Noonan is blessed by God with a gift for words. What this book really is a tribute, and she only uses information that will support that. She does it well; she is a brilliant propogandist. But under the soothing and calm is a rage against anyone or anything that even gently seeks to conflict with the perfectly ordered world of the Ruler Reagan and his gal Peg. No, families never have any troubles. Women are always doing their Stepford best. Kids from good families don't experiment with drugs or sex. This book and the whole lot of recent Reagan books reminds me of the same worship campaign that the Kennedys orchestrated in the post-JFK assassination period. It will probably be some time before we can get a truly fair and balanced and objective view of a good man who was not the best President."
1,Being a character doesn't mean having character,"I find no surprise that a book extolling Reagan has absolutely *no* mention of his visit to the SS graveyard in Bitburg, Germany. It was an event that showed Reagan at his most characterless, refusing to budge and having to be embarrassed into visiting a Nazi concentration camp. This book, like the idea of Reagan being a virtuous, upstanding and honest leader, is a poorly realized lie."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"What a superbly written book by Ms. Noonan. Obviously she is in love with the man, with what he has stood for, with his background, with all of his accomplishments.. and rightly so.What is so striking is the vast difference between the Character of Ronald Reagan and what one might view as a lack of upright, moral character by a man named Clinton who just vacated the Presidential Office, but not before desecrating the office like no one has ever done.If you are a Reagan fan, you'll love this too. If you are not yet a Reagan fan, you too should read it. Even though Peggy Noonan is partial to the man, in the interest of impartiality and fairness she balances her presentation by including stories and events that are not very flattering Mr. Reagan's legacy, but were events that helped to shape his own character as time moved on."
1,Make me puke,"Reagan had no character!!! It was all myth!!! Noonan as the speechwriter helped to create the myth. A good way to sell books to the uninformed and radical right. Reagan ran away from Lebanon-a chicken!!! Attacked Cuban medical workers in Grenada alleging they were creating an airfield--which was a lie. Reagan created illegal wars in Angola and Nicaragua. He helped fascist governments kill hundreds of thousands in Central and South America. Destroyed labor unions and helped the rich. Taxed the middle-class and poor and gave the excess to the wealthy. Was a schill for GE in the 1940's-50's, turned in people as head of the SAG. This guy had no character!!!"
3,When Character Was King- a very good and true title,"This was not a book I picked up by choice. So, considering that it was something I had to read for school, I'll give it three stars. I knew nothing about Ronald Reagan, except that he was shot. However, I now know a little bit more about him as a president and personally. I didn't know, as this book continually pointed out, that Ronald Reagan was a kind man who had dignity but treated everybody equally. It was also interesting to read about his life transitioning from actor to President. That is quite a miraculous life! I recommend this book to anyone who's intersted in government, or just about life changes in general."
3,Could be better,I just really didn't find this book very substantive. The few times that I was enlightened came from direct quotations of Ronald Reagan. Noonan's book is more for people who want an easy beach-read rather than people who intend to be truly educated about the life of Reagan.
4,Sheer Pleasure for Reagan supporters,"Ms. Noonan clearly loves Ronald Reagan, and her book should be seen as a tribute to him and a contribution to his legacy. Readers who share this love of President Reagan, or at least understand the book for what it is, will love it. If you're searching for a critical look at President Reagan's political life-one that examines his policies and ideology from multiple viewpoints, you won't find it here.But for those of us who view Mr. Reagan as a hero and wish to join in this celebration of his life and Presidency, this book is sheer pleasure."
1,correct item but to short,"I purchased 2 of these for my Mitsubishi Montero, Fitting and connectors were correct but for my application, the wiring was to short."
5,"Very Sticky, perfect size","Brother makes some of the best label makers out there and it's nice to see that they support them will a wide array of sizes. The best thing is that the printers can manually detect the size of the label in the printer and adjust the software accordingly.These labels are perfect for smaller spaces (like file folders) but also for labeling hard drives, printers, DVDs, or anything else you may want to ""claim"" as yours without using the large name-tag sized label."
5,Works as advertised,I am using these labels for years now on two Brother label makers. Brother OEM never failed. I have hundreds of file folders which I label in Physician office.
1,Do not stay stuck on file folders,"The roll of labels that I have do not stay stuck. They peel off from both ends so that I have to tape them on, which defeats the purpose. Perhaps it is a batch with bad adhesive, but the problem with this roll has been consistant over several typs of file folders that I use them on. Buyer beware."
3,Bummed,"Did not receive the item pictured, so I'm a bit bummed. What we received is very similar to what was pictured, but item received was not what was pictured..."
4,easy,"It's nice to work this sport with a video. Explanations are good, exercices are not to hard, it's easy to do it 15mn every day, weak up for the mind and the body is sure!"
3,Fast Shipping,"The videos came within just a few days, so I was pleased with the vendor. The tapes themselves, I probably won't use very much since they are so dated in appearance and amateurish in execution."
2,Can't get past how silly she looks,"I am watching this for this first time right now. Maybe I am a shallow person, but I just can't get past how silly she looks teaching her breathing techniques. She makes such ridiculous faces when she inhales and such a ghastly sound when she exhales that I just laugh and laugh, which is not helping me to breathe deeply! The other reviewers must be either much more serious people than I am, or they have some stake in the sales of this video. She sounds somewhere between a person gasping after nearly drowning and a cat hacking up a hairball. I just can't take it seriously."
1,DON'T buy this!!!!,"Okay, so a couple of years back I bought an Enforcer kit (very inexpensive, thought it was a good buy because I was a beginner at the time). Worst investment of my life. Please don't be fooled by anything. You should always buy a drum kit from the more familiar brands, such as Pearl, Ludwig, Yamaha, etc. I couldn't take this drum kit anymore so I bought a Pearl kit. The Pearl kit is SO much better."
1,...,"This thing sounds, plays, feels, and stays in repair worse than any beginnir set IVE EVER SEEN!!!!! The stock heads are awful, the tom mounts fall apart, the cymbals and stands are cheap, the bass pedal has no response or depth, and the bass drums rattles the snare. SO dissapointed, buy a pearl instead."
2,Sound tracks missing,The concert itself is a great concert. The problem is it marked on cover as having DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. Those are MISSING. It only has 2 Channel AC3 sound. Very misleading.
1,"Over rated, did not increase signal at all",I installed the product on three different applications and it did not increase coverage at all. The coverage was the same as the omni antennas that were being replaced.
2,Stick with regular Power Zone workout,"I like Denise Austin in the first Power Zone DVD, so I was eager to go and purchase this one. What a huge let down this one was. Her cuing was horrible, and the workout itself was uninspiring. I also didn't feel like she used the power band as effectively as she could have. In other words, save your money on this one."
4,fun workout,I enjoy Denise Austin. I have done her Blast 10lbs tape for the past couple of years and found this DVD a fun change. It is a steady workout. It is not to difficult but I enjoyed it. I would of given it 5 stars if the cardio was just a little more intense. This is great for me because I had a baby 12 weeks ago and was not able to exercise during my pregnancy. Doing this and the Blast 10lbs for the past 6 weeks I have lost inches and about 10 lbs. I have been watching what I eat as well but feel these tapes really rev up your metabilism!
1,"Boring, boring, boring!","I work out 5 days a week so I would consider myself advanced. This workout is definitely too easy for someone who is advanced. There were a number of parts where I thought I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit. It was very cheesy and the other girls in the video look like robots. My DVD did not come with a band, which I thought was a real bummer. The set and the music are boring. I normally love Denise Austin, but this video was very disappointing. I would instead recommend Shrink Your Female Fat Zones."
2,Not the Best,"I prefer the ""Shrink Your Female Fat Zones"" DVD with the balance ball. I really don't like the resistance strap with this one and I will probably sell my DVD, because I just don't like it. Denise does some great videos, but this isn't among them."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I typically really enjoy Denise Austin's workouts, but this one was very easy, and didn't provide even a moderate intensity workout. I would not recommend this DVD, maybe for beginners who find Denise's other videos a challenge. Overall, I was disappointed."
3,Good for beginners,"I did the DVD for the first time today and didn't really have much trouble following it. I haven't worked out consistently for close to 6 months now and I still found the cardio segment to be on the easy side. I did enjoy the toning because the resistance band allowed me to adjust the resistance to work for me. I didn't think this DVD offered much that other DVDs didn't. This DVD would be good for beginners or exercisers that need a lot of encouragement to keep going and stick with it.I prefer shape magazine's Bikini Body Camp Transforming Workout because they have a 25-30 minute cardio workout that is more intense, a 30 minute toning working that uses a band, and a 30 minute ""skills and drills"" workout. There is a modifier for every workout so people can pick the level that is best for them. I feel bad advertising for them here, but it's a similar style workout that I enjoy much more. It's a little more expensive, but I feel it's a better value."
3,Like it but...,"Denise Austin is great.. The only problem I had with this video was the band they used. After the first use, it was a mess (because of the sweat of my hands) it wouldn't stretch properly anymore. You can still workout with this video without the band but it is a little more tricky to do because they use the band. If you are talented, you can get a great workout with this video without the band. I was not impressed with the band at all. I would not recommend this video for beginners."
4,Excellent! Get a great body because you deserve it!!,"I am 22 years old and I'd say I'm pretty much in shape. I eat right and sometimes when my pockets are a bit more full, I will buy organic food. I love fitness!!!! When buying Denise Austin's video, I felt a bit awkward at first using the resistance band. But after tightening in up a bit and using the 20 minute cardio, the upper body, and the ab workout with my running schedule, I lost 3 pounds in a couple of days! The workout seemed a bit intense at first and I sweated so much, especially when the pony exercise began. But this tape really works!!! Denise Austin is truly a motivator! She has inspired me to keep working out, smile and know that I am worth it! Sometimes, I feel there isn't enough reps, but according to Denise, it's just the right amount to get a slim body. You have to buy this video! It's truly worth it!!"
2,Okay,"I did this video only two times. I felt like I got a good workout in the 25 min cardio section, but I could not follow along with the steps so I lost interest. On the upper and lower body workouts, she does not give enough time to adjust the resistance band before she starts the exercise, and other exercises it seems like the resistance band was not long enough to perform it correctly and I could barely move the band (or it could be that it was too much resistance for me.) I think it would be better done with hand weights instead of the band, but the cardio is good if you can keep up with the steps."
5,Good,I was somewhat satisfied with my purchase. The resistance band wasn't included. I was a bit disappointed.
4,Decent all around workout,"Its half cardio, half toning with bands. Not very long, I think 20 min each. It's good and its programmable. The key to working out with bands is the bands resistance level. If you workout with weights, you probably need a heavier band. Its good to have in your rotation. Not a very heavy workout, but I would say medium to light. I use the Firm and Prevention alot, so that's what I'm comparing this one to.I think this has been released with different dates, so check to see if the date makes a difference."
1,Complete waste of time and money,"I bought this DVD after seeing Denise Austin appear on many talk shows promoting it. Big Mistake....... I found the cardio section barely got my heart rate up and I even found it difficult to follow. I found that the toning section w/ the bands was extremely awkward. Something just wasn't right - maybe the band was too short or maybe the band just didn't have enough give to it - I ended up straining my wrists as I was trying to do the moves. I didn't like anything about this DVD. This was actually the first workout DVD I got and it almost made me swear off all fitness DVDs. After a few months, I decided to give DVDs another try, because I was so fed up with working out at the gym. My next fitness DVD purchase was Tamilee Webb's I want that Body - which turned out to be one of the best out there! Don't waste your money on this Denise Austin DVD, check out my other reviews - there are some fantastic ones out there!"
1,AWFUL,"this was the worst workout video ever. I will never buy a Denise Austin video again. There is barely a warm up and NO cool down, which leaves you with a high heart rate.Terrible. And the cardio was VERY hard to follow.The upper body toning exercises were pretty good, but thats the only segment that was decent. Its a total waste of money. I will just stick to Leslie Sansone."
4,"Denise, stop smiling already","She looks great though.Haven't gotten a chance to do this yet, due to health problems."
1,I sold the DVD after one try,"I don't like her routine in this DVD at all. I don't like the strechie. It's a completely waste and it won't give you the same workout as hand weights or balance ball. I solde the DVD the 2nd day I bought it. However, I do like her 'Shrink Your Female Fat Zone,' which uses dumbell and balance for upper body, lower body and abs."
2,Guitar course,Not what I received. Received another copy of the DVD so I returned it. Still waiting to see if the return gets processed correctly.
3,was a little advanced for someone who knew nothing,The set was as shown and will probably be good after a more basic course is done. We let our grandson use them since he has already had some lessons and he seems to like it.
2,WAS NOT INFORMED THE CD'S WERE NOT INCLUDED,WAS UPSET TO RECEIVE AND NO DVD'S ID RATHER HAVE THOSE THAN READ A BOOK. NOT AS HELPFUL...THERE WAS NOWHERE ON THIS THAT SAID THE DVDS WERE MISSING...
5,Esteban's Guitar CourseEsteban is the best,Estebanis the best. I have many other video guitar courses but this is the best course ou there on the market. You will learn to play the guitar.
2,You won't learn how to play music,"This is kind of a bizarre product. You don't learn to read music, you follow Esteban. The book shows tablature, steps for stumming and each note but really the course is designed to follow Esteban on DVD.Example, after you've followed Esteban and learn part of a song, you'll know the song only by rote - not by reading the notes.Yes, he teaches technique well, but as a beginner, learning how to play the songs and read music is more important than the technique. My biggest annoyance is that the songs are short, abbrieviated to 1/2 page. For instance, you learn the chorus (only) of Greensleeves.On a positive note, the first 7 chapters of the DVD go through basics of the guitar, correct positioning, strumming and finger picking styles. This could be very helpful to beginners.Overall, interesting, but this won't teach me how to play the music."
1,MISS PRINTS MISS PRINTS MISS PRINTS,"I was working on the second song (Green Sleeves) and found out the hard way that the diagram on page 26 does not match what I was trying to play. Luckily the Video tells you the correct chord to play. But on the very next page the diagrams and video don't agree again, not to mention the tune. It's not a very big book! The least they could have done was proof read."
4,Nice bit of help!,"I love to watch Esteban play! This course does teach you some awesome techniques. Esteban shows you step by step how to play a tune, provides a demonstration, then shows you what Esteban can do with it. It provided me with some glimmer of hope that I can achieve a similar talent...but I haven't."
4,Jazz Down Under,"This double album CD confirms the Yarra Yarra band as Australia's leading New Orleans musicians. Accompanied by the legendary Don Ewell, the rythym section is one of the best I've heard, with infinite variation and imagination. Recorded live at Nicholas Hall, Melbourne in 1979, the Yarra's were in top form. Highly recommended."
3,Tasty fruit snacks,I am always looking for healthly snack alternatives. This one was okay.The flavor was decent and the sugar content wasn't too high. My daughter did not love them but wouldn't turn them down. I think it was because she prefers a berry taste and these have a more subdued taste.
3,Goddess Kali,"I bought this dvd as I wanted some floor moves as most of the other bellydance dvds don't cover this. But because I am a beginner belly dancer, I found it too advanced for me. Once I can belly dance well on my own without instruction I will probably add these moves into my routines. But the dvd looks really good I have watched it through and recommend it."
2,Poorly designed calendar with awesome pictures,"They might as well call this a Rob Zombie wall hanging and leave out the calendar part, because its inclusion is rather inconsequential. The actual calendar on each page is a mere 5 inches wide, to apparently make room for the same picture on the bottom half of EVERY page(a picture of Rob's wife incedently). There is also a picture of her underlaying the calendar making the numbering very difficult to read. I would have given it another star if the picture at the bottom varied from month to month at least. If you're looking for a useful calendar, I wouldn't recommend this. If however you already have a calendar that you use, and are just looking for something with awesome pictures of Rob Zombie/House of 1000 Corpses, then this is the calendar for you."
1,"""More"" - is just ""more"" of the same...","I bought this CD for my wife because she is a fan of Crystal Lewis. When my wife played it, it was basically the same songs that she has been putting on her previous ""Greatest Hits"" CDs. I mean, how many times can one song be remixed and re-released? I thought my wife was listening to an old CD, but no, it was the brand new one I got her. Yes, there are a few new tracks on there, but let's let the tracks that have been released over 3 times now finally be put to rest. How many times will ""Only Fools"" or ""Not The Same"" be on a different CD?? How about a little creativity and writing on the next one, eh Crystal???"
5,Great reverse psychology,"This book helped me greatly to determine what was happening in my life at a particular time in my office and its personnel structure. It takes you trhought the characters on a journey of office environments and the typical personalities found therein. I do not have anything but praise for this title. A great read, jovial, and humorous it is a definite buy."
5,Paula Deen's cookbook,Have tried a numer of recipes from these books and nothing bad to date. I had to buy this for my sister since she kept asking for copies of the recipes we had tried and thought were worth repeating. She was thrilled!
4,Great!,"Bought this for my mother for Chirstmas and she loves it! There are many great and easy receipes to try. However, don't expect low fat receipes...."
3,some what disappointed,"Paula's personality is great and sincere,but that is not why I bought this set. Fried chicken was dis-appointing,if you are from the south,you better have fried chicken down pat!!! Some ingredients hard to find, in certain recipes. I wish each recipe before it was published, was tried, by peers and leave out the one's that are marginal in value."
5,I have a question...,"Does this book contain categorized recipes with pictures?Also, does it include many dessert recipes???"
4,"Love the Collection, but recvd Damaged via USPS","Love the collection of receipes from Paula and her sons! Convenient format in spiral binding allows for user to open book flat and read while preparing the ingredients.Books were sent along with 2 other Paula cookbooks in one box with insufficient packing materials. The box was received collapsed on one side and torn open. Hence, the cardboard sleeve for this 2 book set was torn and damaged. Box looked like it had been stomped on. It will have to be taped together to use. Very disappointed to receive damaged! Could never have used as a gift. Unable to pack and return for replacement due to recent surgery, so I will have to just tape it up for use.This is not the first time I have received books from Amazon that had not been packed with enough protective material to prevent book damage."
5,This gal knows how to cook,"Paula Deen may be the best cook ever. I've tried several of her recipes and they are all wonderful. Don't make her dishes if you are counting calories, though."
5,YUMMY!!!!,"Great price with GREAT recipes! I have tried many in this past holiday season and haven't been disappointed yet! I highly recommend this set! As Paula would say... ""Best dishes y'all!"""
5,The Lady and Sons Savannah Country cookbook,"Purchased this for my daughter, who used mine. Great cookbook, and the recipes are some of Paula's best. Got in great shape and quickly."
5,This is faaaabulous!!,I just loooove the easy recipes for Old Fashion comfort food!! I have recommended this to all of my friends and co-workers and they too just cannot wait to try all of the wonderful recipes!PAULA DEEN ROCKS!!!!
5,Homecooking that is sure to please your family,"After watching Paula Deen on the Food Network and then visiting her restaurant, The Lady and Sons in Savannah, I knew this cookbook collection was a must for our home. Her recipes are simple and delicious. There is something in there for everyone with new creations that delight the palette. Her chicken recipes such as Chicken Georgia, Chicken and Dumplings and Chicken Casserole are easy and delicious. The Corn Casserole was probably the easiest dish I have ever prepared and was gone immediately. It is a great sign in my home if you do not have leftovers. I do not have leftovers when I cook with Paula Deen. The only downside is we are having to exercise more because of this delicious food. I figure that it is a small price to pay for having enjoyable sit down dinners with the family. I would definitely endorse this collection for any home. This would be a great gift this Christmas season."
4,LADY & SONS,"Cute book with real recipes from the southern part of the world, which I am from. My sister and I have throughly enjoyed our books, I bought one for her. I also bought the Lady and Sons Dessert book, wow, another great book with cute stories. Both of these books worked great for gifts and wasn't real expensive and my sister and I have laughed and enjoyed these 2 books immensly!!"
5,LOVE IT,"I HAD TO REPLACE MY BOOK, IT CAME UP MISSING. I WAS GLAD THAT THIS WAS AVAILABLE TO ME ON LINE."
4,Paula Deen,"just received this, flipped through but havent tried any of the recipes yet. looks like a few i will deffinately try. not a big fan of Paula Deen but i like the way and simplicity of her cooking."
1,Lady & Sons Savannah Country Cookbook,"I cannot bring myself to cook anything from these books. The recipes include too much fat. Recipes that include large amounts of butter, cream, cheese and creamed commercial soups are both too rich and salty. I'll bet they taste wonderful, however. Creating such fattening dishes is irresponsible. Also I resent having to use Paula's prepared mixes as part of her ingredients, eventhough she does offer the recipes to create substitutions for them.I have watched the TV cooking programs and enjoyed them. The food she cooks has always looked delicious though rich. Paula's accent is lovely to listen to, and her presentation is beautiful.Photos of the finished dishes would have been extremely welcomed. Also, the quality of book paper was poor. I really should simply return the books and might do that. Only 1 star from me, if that.Disappointed."
3,"Decent book, but mostly common sense.","This book was very informative as far as a typical 9-5 workday of a lawyer, but most of her strategies are common sense. Seriously, anyone who doesn't know business manners shoudln't be a lawyer anyway. Its common sense to dress appropriately, to never crack raunchy jokes to a partner, or to speak of how hot another attorney's wife is. If you have any common sense, spend your money on a more practical book with better advice or educational value."
4,Read it early in law school.,"Great advice on making the most out of clerkships, classes, professors, law review, and volunteering opportunities that arise in law school. I wish I had read this book before going to law school."
3,Entertaining,"""Winning Ways"" by Richard I. Lyles is about a recent computer science graduate who is having people problems with his coworkers. His manager introduces him to a football coach who claims to know the ""Winning Ways"" -- the secrets of getting along with other people. Over the course of several meetings, the coach teaches our hero four principals of working well with others: Making others feel stronger, collaborating with others, avoiding two-valued thinking, and influencing for the future.The book is easy reading, however, I recommend you check the book out of your local library before purchasing it. It's useful for recent college grads who are having problems dealing with other people."
5,Very enlightening!!!,"I just loved reading this one. I have already started using the winning ways at the office with great results! I was even surprised when I found myself using the tips for my personal relationships (wife, parents, friends). Everyone should read this one."
1,END OF THE INDIVIDUAL,"The empahasis of society as of late has been on the team rather than the individual. However, I am quite certain that events and inventions of a historical manner were never accomplished by a committee.The individual spirit that made this country great no longer exists. Universities no longer are places of free thought but rather restrict the students to whatever the new PC movement may be at the time."
4,A very nice surprise,"Since I'm one of those kind of people that can listen to Christmas music in the middle of July and feel jolly, I really liked this book. It gives a lot of information. It seems music for Christmas mostly started in the 40's. I'd recommend this book if you're a Christmas music fan."
3,Pretty Much The Same Content As Guerilla Marketing for Job Hunters,"In general, the Career Guide for the High-Tech Professional is worth reading...if you have not already read Guerilla Marketing for Job Hunters 2.0. About 95% of the material of this book was included in the GMFJH book. The only additional nugget that is included in the CGFTGTP was how to deal with headhunters, recruiters, etc. It does provide excellent guidance on how best to approach these professionals (including mistakes that I have already made). Recommended if you have not already picked up the Guerilla Marketing for Job Hunters book or if you need a little addditional guidance on how to best work with recruiters."
4,Works Great!!,looked around at a few other bikes racks and this one seemed to be one of the best for the price.
1,Disappointed,"I like that it secures to the vehicle nicely and the bikes were very stable.But,I bought it for BMX bikes and the width is too wide.Making it very hard to get them on and off.For mountain bikes it would be good.But not for 20"" BMX bikes."
4,worked for Prius V,"We purchased the rack to use on camping trips as our road bikes would not fit well inside the Prius V. It's incredibly sturdy and easy to mount. It took our bikes through rain and detours on the 12 hour road trip without budging them. We could access the hatch easily without removing the rack once the bikes were removed. (Do watch your head when closing the hatch.) We checked with local troopers and it's okay to rest the rack on the license tag as long as it's not a permanent installation and there is partial plate visibility. We did use some foam blocks to lift the straps up to completely clear the spoiler although standard mounting did not appear to put pressure on it. The backup camera use was not significantly degraded. I didn't give the product full stars because it came in a box that was open at both ends. Come on guys, use a little more tape please!"
3,The musics are difficult to sing...,"My daughter is five years old and loves to sing. We bought a karaoke for her as a Christmas gift. We bought this CD ""Disney's Karaoke Series: Disneymania, vol.2"" but the musics are very difficult for her to sing..."
5,Great cookbook,"This cookbook has some really great recipes. My new daughter-in-law is from California, and I am making a big hit finding recipes she is used to that appeal to our whole family, as well."
2,3rd Time Not Such a Charm,"Well, we all loved the first two ""Now""'s. They had a large number of tracks, as well as great selections, and a good variation of genres. Unfortunately, ""Now 3"" does not follow in the footsteps of its predecessors. With a limited selection of ten tracks, it gives you no more than 35 minutes of listening. Also, unlike the first two ""Now"" releases, ""Now 3"" offers no variation in genre. Genre listing- R&B- 5 / Rock- 3 / Pop- 1 / House- 1 / And the biggest mistake- Rap/Hip Hop- 0. Do they have any idea how many people won't buy this record because hip hop is not represented even once? The people who selected the tracks for ""Now 3"" must be the same people that run the three major networks. So this Christmas, don't bother buying ""Now 3."" Stick to the originals."
5,Good service,Company provided very quick service. Package arrived fast and in great condition. Would for sure do business again with this company.
3,A few good songs,Highlights:1. All Star Smash Mouth2. American Woman Lenny Kravitz4. Bailamos Enrique Iglesias14. Hey Leonardo (She Likes Me for Me) Blessid Union of Souls18. Out of My Head Fastball
4,Now This Is Definetly What I Call Music,"I really think that this collection of great song is awesome. Some of the best songs I ever heard like Limp Bizkit's Nookie, Smash Mouth's All Star, and Blink 182's What's My Age Again. I would definetly recommend this cd to anyone who doesn't have it."
3,it was okay,The copy of the cd that I have has 18 songs on it. Where ever everyone else got their's didnt give them the entire cd. Maybe they should get another copy. All in all it was pretty good. I recommend it if you like the 1st 2 now cds. bye
3,OK.........,"Who would like to hear a bunch of overplayed songs on one cd? well if you do than this is your cd. But there are some good songs on the cd, but still all of them I've heard over 30 times. If you haven't heard these songs before and you dont live in the US than maybe you would want to buy it but if you listen to pop stations and have heard these songs over and over than your not going to like it."
3,"Good CD, but doesn't label edited songs.","a previous reviewer mentioned about the editing and how it wasn't labeled for ""Rocafeller Skank"" by Fatboy Slim..there is another song that's edited -- ""American Woman"" by Lenny Kravitz...I noticed it right away when the label said ""3:49"" for length -- the original is about 4 minutes and 20 seconds! (to make it clear, the fade on the song comes in too early at the end) ...usually Now does a good job of labelling the songs if they're an edit, but they didn't do it so they would get a larger audience? Now I don't know if I'm getting the original on any other songs... :( If you want an original copy of all of these songs, buy the single or buy the artist's album."
2,hello,"what....i thought this is suppose to have top chart hits? only like 4 songs are good and the rest i don't even know. well if u want to buy it go ahead, it's not my money"
5,Great,I love the now cd's because it is saves you a lot of money. Instead of buing costly singles or even the artist's cd it is easy and more convienent.
2,"better than some of the others, but still a waste","If this didn't have boy bands & the poor excuse of a singer Britney on here, it might get another star!! But nevermind that, the Smash Mouth & Limp Bizkit were the most ANNOYING & OVERPLAYED tracks by those bands I've ever heard. If I wanted to hear Blink, Garbage, & Lenny Kravitz, I would never buy this mix. Just mix your own cd... if everyone had a way to sell their mix cds, you'd have quite a variety there. These NOW compilations only cater to the blind masses, & the masses have NO CLUE what else they're missing that's 10 TIMES BETTER!!"
1,Really Bad CD,I really do not like this cd. The only rason I bought it is because I want to have all the cd's in Now That's What I Call Music. I only heard of 5 songs on this whole cd and most of the others I never even heard of the person who sings the song. I think you should skip this Now 3 and get Now 4 or 5 instead they are much better. I just hope you will never get this cd and speand your money on a different one. Hope this helped.
3,Was Hoping for Much More,"I don't know, compilations are supposed to include HITS that the majority of listeners can recognize. This CD is just a mix of whatever the record label happened to feel like adding, regardless of whether the songs got heavy airplay, a positive listener response, etc. I did enjoy 50% of the tracks, but the rest I'd trade in for some REAL hits from the past 12 months."
2,Now That's What I Call A Mistake!,"NOW 3 is nothing like all the other NOWs. It is completely different. A lot of the songs are songs that have not made it to the Top 40. Some are K-Ci and JoJo's ""Tell Me It's Real"", Ideal's ""Get Gone"", Case's ""Happily Ever After"", and the list goes on. It has rap-rock crossover, Limp Bizkit's ""Nookie"" and songs that made it to the Top 40 but are no good anyway like Blink 182's ""What's My Age Again?"" or Lenny Kravitz's ""American Woman"". Some songs are good, however, like Smash Mouth's ""All Star"", Backstreet Boys' ""All I Have To Give"", 98 Degrees' ""The Hardest Thing"" and Britney Spears' ""Sometimes. But when half the songs on the album are bad, then it's not good. If you want an album that is half Top 40 and the other half songs you don't know, get this. Me? I'm a Top 40 listener, so I'd stick with any other NOW or Totally Hits album. Thank you for reading my review."
3,Now! 3 Very Average,"I have already reviewed Now! 4 and 5 and thought I should now do 3. Now! 3 doesn't compare to 4 or 5, it just doesn't do anything for me, there are hits from Britney Spears ""Sometimes"" and the Backstreet Boys ""All I Have To Give"" that give the album a boost, but then they hit bottom with Limp Biskit's ""Nookie"" and ""What's My Age Again"" from Blink 182, 2 songs I think the album could go without. Now! 4 and 5 have so much more to offer that Now! 3 should be left behind. It's just a very average album."
3,Not very many memorable songs,What went wrong?After the glorious Now 2 here we have the next installment and possibly the worst installment as well.My view is probably slightly hindered here as most of these songs were not hits in the UK but that didn't stop me liking Now 1 or 2 any less so maybe this cd is just actually worse than those two.It isn't all bad though - Hey Leonardo is just excellent and If I Could Turn Back The Hands Of Time is a song anybody could like easily and is one of the best here. Other good songs are The Rockafeller Skank which just sounds amazing and my favourite All Star.But on comparing this to the rival compilation Totally Hits this just doesn't stand out in the crowd so sadly despite the great name i wouldn't recommend this due to the fact that there are other greater CD's available.
5,Excellent compilation,"I now live outside the States and this really is collection of everything the radios have been playing (from what I can tell using real audio). It's a great way to catch up and not have to listen to what the local, non-US DJs decide is good music"
5,Awesome,"This does not have as many good songs as now2, but they are better. I saw it online here with 12 songs but had seen the full version elsewhere, so I knew there was a mistake. I did not know all the songs, but many are good."
3,AVERAGE CD,"This cd was okay. It had a few good songs but that was it. NOW 2 is way better. That is a much much better cd. They made this look bad compared to NOW 2. I like the NOW series, but they made a poor third one."
2,This product needs a re-designed filter,I needed a compact vacuum that is good for wood floors as well as rugs. This product would be perfect except that the filter has grooves which are hard to clean out and instructions tell you not to use a brush to clean them out.
2,Dirt Devil Dynamite,"I tested this vacuum as soon as it was delivered. It was much too heavy and much too noisy- I was so disappointed. I don't know how they can advertise it as under 9 lbs. There was nothing lightweight about it and the vacuum was difficult to maneuver- didn't want to roll smoothly. It's cleaning capability is good. Amazon, true to their word, refunded the cost & I was pleased about that & most certainly will deal with them again and again."
2,Have seen better vaccums,Have seen better vacs. This doesn't do a great job cleaning. Have to often broom up stuff after vacuuming. A big plus is no bags.
3,The little vacuum that could,"I have two cats, and I am a woman with long hair. This is the first vac I've had under 100 that hasn't broken down with the daily cleaning. Great suction, it thoroughly removes all dust and hair from tough surfaces. I love the long cord and its light weight. Compact, it fits into small closetsDown sides: 1. The bagless dirt collector: difficult to empty without using your hands to get out things you'd rather not.2. NOISE!3. difficult to clean filter"
4,powerful bargain,This vacuum plain sucks!! In a goood way. It's a very good vacuum for the price i paid. Walmart had it for 39 bucks and it works soooooo good in our apartment. I highly recommend.
1,Are you serious?,"I hate this vaccum. I have two kids, two dogs, and a husband that is messier than the other four. I bought this for my basement family room because I was tired of carrying my 'good' vaccum up and down the stairs, it has only been six months and I am shopping for something else. The hose clogs CONSTANTLY, and we call it the two steps forward four steps back vac. You have to go over an are 3 or 4 times to pick everything up, and the hose for the attatchments is only about a foot long so it's pretty useless as well. Yes, it's lightweight and the dirt cup is big and easy to empty, but what good is all that if it doesn't really vaccum?! If 0 stars was an option, this would get it."
3,Not the best!,"I live with 5 people and we use this little vacuum about once a week or so. It needed it's belt replaced after about 4 months and since the start it never really worked that well. Plus, there's no attachment that comes off to clean the corners & cracks & crevices--possible true for most stand-up models but this one doesn't have a very sharp nose and doesn't get very close to the edge of anything (like when you push it up against a wall it only sucks at about 4 inches out). It doesn't suck too well either. I think 4/6 of us were really disappointed, 1/6 felt like it was alright, and 1/6 thinks it's perfectly fine.As a follow-up to this review, it's been a few more months and the thing stopped working! It lasted about 9 months total. JUNK!"
4,"Good Suction, powerful, loud, compact, lightweight etc...","I found this vacuum cleaner to be very lightweight to carry from room to room. They have a sticker which boasts a 25ft cord so you can do multiple rooms, but personally I would prefer 5 more feet because I can't do multiple rooms. Great suction power. Very unusually loud after using a similar more quiet vacuum called the Shark. Extremely hard to push or thicker pile carpet, but it's a good ab and waist work-out. On thinner carpets such a decorative 5 x 7 carpets it worked well. On regular throw carpets such as in your bathroom, kitchen or doorways, it won't roll over because it's way to powerful and starts to suck the smaller rugs up.Again, I may have been used to the Shark. I love that fact that after the first ten minutes of vacuuming for the first time, I saw all kinds of debris in the see through canister."
2,Extremely Loud,"There are many reviews about this product so I'll keep it short.I think there are two problems with this vacuum:1. It is extremely loud. I vacuumed my 1 bedroom apartment 20 minutes ago and I still have a headache!2. It is hard to move it on the carpet.I purchased this vacuum from Wal-Mart for $40 today. I wanted something compact and cheap. Well, you get what you pay for. I will return it ASAP."
4,let me also say....,"this thing rocks. the first time i used it, i filled the cannister nearly halfway with dust and dirt i couldn't even tell was on my carpet. this thing is powerful. my only complaints: the canister section is a little loose on the base, so it feels like it's going to fall over if you stand it upright. it hasn't yet, but we'll see. also, it does feel a bit plasticy, as another reviewer said. i've only had it for a week, so i can't speak to the durability, but so far i love it. highly recommended."
5,Excellent small vacuum,"This is an excellent vacuum that does everything that was advertised. It is very easy to use and store and it looks good too. It picks up fairly well and seems to operate better after you've used it a few times. It is fairly simple to unattach the dirt container and cleans up very easy. I found that if you unattach the little HEPA filter and run some water through it to clean off the debris, it seems to perform even better. Fantastic little appliance that every home owner should have. Price is very reasonable for what it is able to do. I recommend this vacuum cleaner for anyone who likes to keep their place tidy and neet. The only thing that this machine doesn't have is a nice hose or attachment to get between the cracks and crevices. But other than that, an excellent purchase for the price."
5,"Witty, engrossing mystery, not just for ""legal eagles""","Sarah Caudwell's mysteries are a treat for lawyers and those involved in the legal profession, but also for readers who enjoy a good, page-turning, British-wit novel. I love Ms. Caudwell's books, second only to the Sherlock Holmes mysteries to me, and eagerly await further adventures of Professor Tamar and the barristers of Lincoln's Inn."
4,Shortest Way to Hades,"After reading her obiturary in the NYT, I was fascinated by its description of Cauldwell's writing as ""the nearest to Oscar Wilde"" they had read in years. On that recommendation alone, I bought all three of her titles and await the fourth and final this summer. Not normally a mystery fan, these books are loaded with wit, surprise and high-jinx. The writing is sharp and engaging. Read them all and you'll see why I hope the BBC and Channel 4 put this marvelous Hillary Tamar character on a TV series. I only wish Sarah Cauldwell had lived beyond 61 years - what a shame cancer got her so soon."
3,Liked the characters,"but the story bogged down in the middle too much for my taste. There were a lot of characters and a lot of relations among the characters- I had a hard time keeping up with who was who! My real problem with the book, however, was that much of the story was advanced through letters from one of the good guys. The story had basically slowed to a stop and then all the footwork and plot advancement happened in these letters. I just did not like that method for development. After reading these letters our hero, the Professor, figures everything out and gets on an airplane to resolve the case. Maybe if the letters had been developed as part of the plot and the 100 pages of filler before had been eliminated I could have got into the fun. Oh well!"
3,"A very quick read, but not particularly well-written","This short memoir about John MacArthur is written by a bartender that worked for MacArthur for many years. It's a cursory glance into the life of MacArthur and those that worked with him, and doesn't go in depth as much as I'd hoped. At times, it feels that the author didn't really know MacArthur on a personal level, so many of the stories are actually about other workers at the hotel with Mr. MacArthur slipping in and out briefly, or making some edict that others had to deal with. If you're looking for a quick intro into the life of one of the insurance mogul, you'll enjoy it. It's a quick read that doesn't require much thinking."
3,Call [...],"Very little laughter from me. It's not that Madigan's humor is distinctly unfunny or in bad taste, which is why my rating isn't any lower, it's simply average humor. I gave this album away. Pity! She's funny on the Bob & Tom show because she has a cast of four to bounce off of."
5,In other words,"Very Funny! I think Kathleen is one of the funniest ladies out there would love to see a live show, worth every penny."
3,not that exciting but my son loves it,"To me, this toy is not very exciting at all. But my 4 year old loves it. It takes 2 AA batteries, and has an on/off switch on the back. When you flip it on, the wheels turn and it drives off across the floor. For the most part I guess, when it bumps against a corner, it will turn off to the side and keep going, but if it hits something head on, the wheels will just keep spinning until you turn it off. Spiderman is removeable and his arms, legs do move, but the figure does not stand alone. The hands can grip on to the bike handles.Overall, I guess the toy is pretty durable, considering it keeps bumping into things. But the sound of the wheels turning is really loud and tends to get annoying pretty quickly.My son likes this toy alot and plays with it every day. I wouldn't spend more than $15 though. Luckily we found it through an Amazon vendor for around that price."
1,Exciting?,"This toy is anything BUT exciting. My son got this for his birthday party and I was only happy that I wasn't the one that spent money on it. It is slow moving for starters, which was an ultimate disappointment for my 4-year-old. When it runs into an obstacle the tires just click non-stop in an attempt to get away and change direction but it never actually accomplishes this. My son ends up having to retrieve and move it himself. So, basically, it drives in one direction until it is stopped by something and then just makes an obscene amount of noise."
4,Good bars for tricking your kids into eating breakfast!,"I've been eating Promax bars for years and now have a 7 year old who does not believe that eating is required to sustain life, so these bars come in handy. We've tried EVERYTHING out there and Promax is at the top of the list for flavor and are good for you, too. My husband really likes this flavor, but the chocolate mint are my favorite and my picky eater's favorite, too. Cookies and cream are a big hit, too. I haven't tried the new caramel one, but plan on it."
2,Not so great,"Bought this partially based upon the other Buyer review. Received the pad and put it on the mattress. It fits very loosely and bunches up under the sheet causing annoyance. Because it's waterproof, you tend to sweat because of it causing an uncomfortable sleep. Had to buy another mattress topper to put on top of it because of it. Also, the other reviewer said that this doesn't make noise - I disagree. The closest analogy is that it feels like sleeping on a diaper. It's noisy and annoying. If I didn't have to have a mattress protector to ensure the mattress warranty, I wouldn't use it."
3,Get to the PointWave,"I like Tobin Smith on Bulls and Bears, and since I enjoy business books bought a copy of Changewave 2.0. The first 100 pages talk about ""Changewave"" ideas: cotton gin, auto, radio, tv, computer,web, etc. The idea is to buy the leaders as these trends emerge. Why that took a 100 pages is beyond me. Tobin fills the pages with words like ChangeQuake, FadQuake, Marketquake. (Even a glossary in the back for made up words)I thought for a minute Miss Marsha had written an investment book. The second half of the book was ok, the most cogent point was that the only way you make money in stocks is when you sell.My suggestion, is to pick up a copy of the Gorilla Game which I read a few years ago. It is the same concept, but is much more detailed and useful to individual investors. For the technical analysis/ growth investing segment of the book, How to Make Money in Stocks by William Oneil gives a reader far more insight on how to select stocks and protect profits."
1,Patchwave,"* Gibberish* Cryptic* Unclear* Made up terms* ConfusionAn incredible patchwork of many different known authors efforts and publications as if Mr Smith was writing the book with all the investment magazines, newspapers and financial newsletters open in front of him a bit like an 8th grader term paper.Not a sexy concept anymore, Mr Smith should teach how to prevent losses with a logical theory and a ""portable"" language that everyone can understand after all isn;t that what ""open source"" is about?"
3,"Hocus Pocus. You're Rich, You're Not!","A lot of jargon. ChangeQuakes are the equivalent of new ideas with potential (think fuel cells). Killer Value Propositions are the MBA grad's equivalent of core competencies.""Do I really want changequakes and killer value propositions?"" Or do I want to understand tech?At least it's a lunch-break read."
5,Rescued Me!,"I purchased this book when I was doing my final year project on J2ME. Although I was even new to J2SE I started coding in J2ME since I had to finish the project, using the internet sources and some introductory books to J2ME. After lots of disappointment in understanding J2ME I found this book and in a very short time I built up my knowledge of J2ME to write a 4000 line,object-oriented,well designed J2ME application. The book was not a game book to me, it was a complete source of J2ME."
5,Better price than bookstore for sure.,Bought it for my daughter as textbook for her school. It's always better price than school's Textbook store.
5,Among The Best,"This is defintiely one of the better book's on the wisdom of the various religions around the world. Good content, and a pretty diverse variety of material included here. Any studdent of religion will appreicate it."
4,Deeper than you can imagine,"On repeated visits to the bookstore, I kept getting drawn to this book, leafing through it and inevitably had to buy it.The author wrote this book because there was no handy reference book for his students in which he could draw from all the wisdom of the various religions.The book has great wisdom derived from all the worlds major religions. It even has creation myths from different parts of the world. Interesting to note the similarities and differences.For example with Buddhism, he includes A Sutra about the practice of right mindfulness, which I find incredibly useful and reassuring. I also love the passage Dear to Me from the Bhagavad Gita.I also appreciate the passage from Chuang Tsu about The Quiet Mind, which is brilliant.If you were to read you would discover chapters on Primal religions, and even Shamanism. Novak allows us to see the patterns, and draw our own conclusions.I trust you find this helpful."
5,great book...,...to use for cramming during the final push. explanations are helpful and it covers a lot of material in very little time and space.
3,Great for PCs but not so great for Macs,"My entire office is run on iMacs and our time tracking was done on paper time sheets. The book keeper would have to enter these manually into QBooks because there is no QBooks timer for Mac!I had to reverese engineer the QBooks timer to automate the time tracking for costing.Besides this major lack in transparency between OS's, QBooks is the best it's ever been."
4,A heavy metal lesson in respecting your past,"The GoodDevastating riffs and biting licks dominate ""With the Flow"". You recognize instantly that Creozoth have that classic metal/thrash sound down cold. ""Forsaken"" slowly builds tension with a meaty guitar riffs and haunting vocals. The vocals are full of despair and sorrow and the guitar solo is a shred fan's wet dream. ""For Your Amusement"" comes at you with break-neck speed, and some of the fast licks you've heard. Shrieking guitar bends and wails command ""Bad Day,"" as well as monstrous chugga-chugga riffing. ""Dash"" is a killer, apocalyptic-type instrumental, while ""Spectorized"" is a calming, clean-toned one.The BadNot a lot of diversity between the songs. You can tell that the vocalist is struggling with the English lyrics at times.The VerdictIt's nice to know that classic American heavy metal is alive and well in Sweden. Creozoth is a heavy metal lesson in respecting your past."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Alien Saga will be of interest to people who have seen all of the Alien films (though it was made before the ""vs. Predator"" franchise started) and not to others: it contains a wealth of behind the scenes information that is fascinating if you like the series, but there's no reason to see it if you don't."
5,Well rounded...,"Since I own the Alien Quadrilogy, I was curious as to exactly what this could add to the massive amount of info already included in the Quad collection. Woud it simply be a rehash of old material? So I bought it and was pleasantly surprised. While more actor interviews would have been nice (ol Yaphet Kotto is still as elusive as ever) it's a very good documentary. I enjoyed it quite a bit although I had no idea how old it was. Watching it knowing that it's pre-AVP & AVPR, it's an interesting perspective. But being a completist I had to get it and I don't regret doing so. I recommend it to all Alien fans."
4,Name/Description is misleading,"I rated this 4 stars because is Timken, the best quality found in bearings. However, the description/name is misleading because it says Bearing Set, and definetely this item is not a set, it's just one bearing. For it to be a set it should come at least one bearing and a seal, two bearings, etc.But don't be confused for bearing set, is just one single and plain bearing"
4,Decent value for the money,"I've been using these combo packs since I purchased my HP 375 printer about 2 years ago. Ink just comes close to running out (shows ""low"") just about the time the paper runs out. Last few might show some lightening, but in general a more than fair deal."
4,VERY GOOD STORY!,"Although not as emotionaly intense as I would have liked --Jonathan seemed to be on a verge of an exhaustion breakdown which is certainly understandable when he has to fight the prejudice of a townspeople who didn't want change. Not even to save their own lives.And Ericka, a loving, steady young woman who wanted to be a good mama and whatever else to bring about family unity. But why do women worry about losing their identities? It certainly shows a lack of self confidence -- all they have to do is make their own identy within their realm of life. And always add love. Ericka's greatest strength.I really loved her solution to the baby's problem with cows milk.Altogether a perfectly satisfying story with great characters - would have like to hear of more interaction with the ""forbidden"" indians -- and somebody should have slapped the Mayor's wife a time or two but her character was so life like."
5,stephanie beaton,This double feature is full of suspense. It in my opinion is a collectors item dvd. Stephanie Beaton is one of my favorite actresses. She made it all worth buying.
2,Not worth the money,"I expected a feature-length film on some aspect of the Hungarian Revolution, a piece of history brought to life. God love the ""film"" makers--instead I paid full price for a 16-minute indy (!) scene made in the Midwest. I applaud the sentiments but tossed the DVD."
2,No Greater Love,I was extremely disappointed with this CD. The entire content of this movie is described on the cover. I was expecting a great heart felt story; and not a very brief encounter of 2 men from different sides of the globe. 15 minutes could have been made into an excellent 2 hour inspiring tale.
5,A Book For Riders of All Levels,"I orignially saw this book & planned to buy it for a friend who has the fear of physical injury when she rides. As I glanced through the book I began to recognize that I had performance fears & that my fears were normal for competitive riders. The authors discuss the ""mental"" issues that all riders face & encourage riders to embrace their nervousness, focus it & use it to enhance performance. I plan to read this book at least 2 more times!!!"
4,52 bottles of beer on the wall 52 bottles of beer,"This is a killer album. It isn't the freshest album in the world but it kicks and sounds great on the system in my car. Lots of thumps, killer vocals and some gritty lyrics. Malaise mix elements of Suspiria, Sisters, Fields of the Nephilim, and a lil industrial and bring something somewhat fresh to the table.If you are into bands like Apoptygma Berzerk, Wolfsheim, Fields of the Nephilim and the Sisters you will love this cd, since it has elements of all of the above."
2,"OK, BUT NOT GREAT","IT WAS AUFUL, THE THOUGHT OF A CREATURE THAT LIKES SLOW SWIMMERS FOR LUNCH IS SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Whetted my appetite for more,"Assigned as a textbook in my 19th century philosophy class, I must admit that this little volume was a pleasure to read - twice. While it may be criticized as a collection of Nietzschean quotable quotes, I was continually fascinated by his insights. It left me wondering if any of the ideas attributed to Freud were actually original, and it confirmed some of my own hard won critiques of contemporary evangelicalism.Before the class was over I had purchased another half dozen books by this man!A warning to those considering reading this - you will not receive pages of editorial content. Go elsewhere if you are looking for an interpretation of Nietzsche. Also, you may find this thinker as addictive as I have."
1,in reality it's a big mistake,WHOOPS! Sorry guys this is not the reality check you were expecting with hit's like masqarade. this is not a christian cd nor is it lyrically sound *apparently* so if you're looking for the lead singer of luna halo his stage wiggling white boy and one rockin regge man you're at the wrong place. please don't make a mistake and order this one. This diserves ZERO STARS!
5,Great Moments on TV,"The show opens up with Judy singing her standards and then she's joined by a cherub-faced Liza. They duet on a couple of songs together, and the show hums along. Judy then intoduces her ""new friend""; enter Barbra. At first glance Barbra looks out of her league. Moon faced (from the dark lighting), with the bridge of her nose casting a shadow on her cheek, so it looks crooked (it isn't crooked, its the lighting). She starts to sing and that voice surrounds you like a deep fog. You knew this young girl was going to be a big star. There was something special about her. By the end of the song, she blows you and the audience away! When all the lights come on, she's absolutely beautiful. This was a true ""happening"". When Judy and Barbra duet on the medley, ""Happy Days/Get Happy"", it has to be one of the greatest moments in the history of TV."
5,A+++,"Fast ship; great product; great company! More words, more words more words, more words, more words, almost done with the required words."
4,Works as advertised,Works as advertised. The labels do warp a bit with age but this does not affect how they print or attach.
2,The label count was at least 50 less.,"The label count was at least 50 less that what it said on the box. Unfortunately, we found out after we printed all the label or we have sent it back."
3,Wrong Size,"When I orderedthese labels, they said ""Standard Shipping Labels"" which to me means a larger than an address label. Otherwise, these are great labels, good service, and there is nothing better than the PC/MAC labeler that comes up on your computer screen. Wonderful tool."
3,Customer Pleased / Shipping Company Should Be DROPPED,"I have to concur with the others. The product is superior in quality and utility. Bar none the best I have owned. However, my experience with the way the product was shipped is the same as the other gentleman. The boxes received were SEVERELY damaged when they were received. Fortunately, the product is of such a durable nature that it did not seem to matter much. BUT, if a vendor of mine sent my product out in tatters, that would be the last product they ever shipped for me. SHOP FOX = good stuff."
3,Fox bench,"This could really be a great system if someone would just make sure the packaging was sufficient, and the colors matched. Some of the flanges were bent, but I straightened them. Packaging sucks. The lower support/shelf bars are a completely different color than the corner legs. The legs are an off white, pretty good looking, while the lower shelf bars are a yellowish color...ugly. Makes a good stout bench when a good top is installed."
3,"Some bent components, but still works","I drove to the Bellingham, WA showroom and picked up the D2910 legs and the 60 X 30 inch maple top. The boxes they loaded onto my truck were in perfect condition, but when I got home and opened them I noticed that some of the leg flanges were bent. The bends weren't bad, and I live a hour away from the showroom, so I decided to proceed. I also had to run to the hardware store to replace a missing washer.I attached the legs to the top with 1/4 x 1-1/4 inch lag screws and washers. The flanges straighten out when I tighten these down and some of the paint cracked as a result of this. It appears the flanges were bent BEFORE they were painted.Grizzly obviously has some serious quality control issues, but despite these flaws, I am satisfied with the workbench. It is incredibly strong and stiff. It is much better than anything I could have built from scratch and looks nice too."
2,Muzak for supermarkets,"I bought this CD because of the other rave reviews here, boy was I disappointed.The music is maybe exciting for people that find Sade etc. original, this CD will be collecting dust till I can find someone to give it to.I have 400+ CD's and 600+ vinyl albums with all kinds of music so maybe Im too interested in music for this realease."
4,GOOD CD,I LIKE THIS CD. ESPECIALLY THE BOB MARLEY COVER. I THINK i HAVE LISTENED TO IT AT LEAST 50 TIMES IF NOT MORE. I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL.
2,Cheap,The clamps were inexpensive compared to the competition but I was fooled by the brand name since Shop Fox is a reputable name.Two of the clamps after only one use will no longer grip on the pipe and will slip as one tries to tighten across a clamping span.I guess you get what you pay for.
3,OK for the price,"These things are pretty cheaply made. The handle falls off of one of them, but they work just good enough that I haven't considered replacing them. If you want to save money I would recommend these, otherwise try to find something of better quality."
3,Good basic book,This book is geared more to the novice doing their first engine rebuild. Very informative. Not the book if you are looking to take the motor to the next higher level.
2,"Dated, not enough photos. Too general.",I wanted to rebuild my 390 and bought this book to help me with that adventure. I was sorely disappointed with the outcome. The book lacks any real instruction and serves as a general overview of the breed - Ford big block motor. There are some photos but nothing that is useful in rebuilding or repairing other than photos of placement of accessories or other things. If you are attempting to build a BB motor look elsewhere with regard to instructional manuals.Thanks for reading my review.
3,Great book if you are rebuilding an old block out of an old car with original parts,"Great book if you are rebuilding an old block out of an old car with original parts. Lots of basic info. Apart from the basics, this book is useless if you are (re)building an engine using new and modern performance parts for a hot rod or kit car. Then again, the book is 22 years old. Missing were Torque tables and how to basically tune the engine and the carb for the breaking in milage. Not much point having the engine professionally tuned or dynoed if the engine is not yet broken in, you have to do it again after a few 1000 miles."
1,"Worst ""manual"" ever",Very Upset with this purchase. The manual has generic information in it. I am a diesel mechanic and work on ford motors all day and have got more information from the 6.0 bible than this
2,Sub-Par,"The quality here is less than a standard studio DVD. To be fair we must note that there has never been a good version of this film released on DVD and this low quality BD is probably the best image to date. If your a big Flynn fan you might justify the price just to have the best but this low quality should be priced at about $10. Every Warner, Flynn DVD, looks much better than this Blu-Ray."
1,a lukewarm Kool and the Gang with no J.T. Beware!,"I am a long-time Kool and The Gang fan, and I was excited that the magic of their live show might finally be captured on a CD. But what I heard instead was a very disappointing, J.T.-less, performance. Great song selection, but the Gang sounds rushed and kind of going-through-the-motions. This was an Australian performance evidently recorded before J.T. reconnected with the band, so the versions are capable vocally but his absence is definitely felt. Its obvious that the comapny clearly wanted to convey the idea that J.T. is the singer on the CD, because his picture is on the cover, and there is no mention in the notes of the line-up to suggest otherwise (actually, there ARE no notes, just ads for the company's other ""product""). Could they be more exploitative, or what? So beware before you buy. And we Gang fans definitely deserved better!"
1,Advertized as: Plug and Gasket.,"You do not get a ""Plug and Gasket"". They just send a gasket.You get a washer, lined with rubber."
4,Good Read,I enjoyed reading Invincible and thought the book was great. I watched the movie when it came out and as usual the book was alot better than the movie. I would recommend this book to any football fans.
5,Excellent Story with Local and Personal Moments,"When I purchased the item I thought that I was getting a copy of the DVD Invincible - My error as I loaned my original DVD out to friends and it never came back. Now, back to the booklet. After having read it I told my wife about it, who, by the way is also a football fan and we both knew a local Eagle player personally who actually played with Vince. The booklet provided so many short stories about the local region when we lived and grew up in that we could recall many of the situations that happened. Having meet Vince one time, the booklet was as personal as it could be. I advised many of our friends to go to Amazon and purchase it also. Well written and very enjoyable."
5,Good steamer,I use this steamer for my daughter who is now 7 months. I prefer to make my own baby food for her and this steamer works great.
4,Collapsible Steamer,Does the job efficiently. Easy to clean and store. I use it almost every day. Great item for the price.
1,poor quality,The removable lifting post and steamer basket have mismatched threads or they were stripped and the post would not screw in. Very disappointed in the quality and returned for replacement which hopefully will work.
3,Legs too small :(,"I really liked this steamer since it's collapsible but the legs are too small and I can't put much water in the pan to steam food for my baby. The water evaporates very quickly leaving the pan to burn. It is a 5 star item if they start making the legs a little taller. However, I am trying to see if I can put some metal thingy in the pan before putting this steamer on that metal stuff. I think that trick will work:)"
1,handle/post doesn't fit,I was hoping that the other review about the mismatched post/handle or wrong thread on screw that attaches the middle post to the steamer was a fluke - it was not. Mine arrived with the same problem. First return in 5 years to Amazon for a defective product.
1,broken,One of the legs broke off in less than a year which makes it useless. Now I'm looking at other options. I'm not buying this brand again.
1,Legs way too short,"You have to add about 1/4 inch of water in order not to submerge the vegetables. Even then the veggies still seem to be soaked. Water and condensation are too close to the veggies creating a soggy taste and feel. And forget about vegetables that take a long time to steam (artichokes, for example). Steam for more than a few minutes and all the water will evaporate and you'll be left with a burning pot. I nearly destroyed a good pot because of this.Making the legs longer seems like a simple thing. Then again it might increase the price. I suppose you get what you pay for.Better to go with the type that goes on top of the pan, rather than the bottom of the pan like this one."
2,annoying,"This product annoyed me. It's just so much work. I just feel as though a steamer should be a simple thing. It's not that it doesn't work, it just doesn't work well. You have to have the perfect size pot or pan, and then you have to fill it with just so much water so as not to soak the vegetables, it's not very big, and it's a pain in the back side.I ended up just buying a pot with a pot insert steamer that is MUCH easier to deal with and worth the extra money."
3,"As described, legs should be taller","Steamer basket is as described, but I do wish that the legs were taller. They are very short and stubby, and leave very little room for water underneath. I also empathize with some of the other reviewers here that the construction may not be durable; I've only used it once so far so that will show with time. I did have the center stick with ring in my box, but it is also very short so not terribly helpful when there's hot steam. Also, it does say that it's dishwasher safe on the box. One other reviewer had mentioned how hard it was to clean since it supposedly could not go in the dishwasher. Mine says dishwasher safe, though perhaps there are slightly differing models being sent out?"
3,MISSING THE LIFTING STEM,I received the collapsible steamer quickly and in the original box. One problem there was no center lifting stem. I tore the box apart to see if I missed it. Nope just wasn't in there. Makes it pretty hot get out of the steamer!
3,"It does its job, and no plastic","We have been on a crusade against plastics, so we got on board with this old school steamer. It does its job, and it's not too much to clean up. It can only get a bit annoying in that you have to hand wash it and if you're cooking broccoli, the tiny particles can get stuck in between the flaps and it can be hard to get out. Also it sometimes collects bits of our sponge. But it works. If only there were a version of this that washed itself, I would prefer that. Maybe in the future. Additionally, it is a bit clumsy to take out of the pot. I either insert a fork prong into the tiny ring in the middle, or a use a very thick oven mitt to lift it out, but even then sometimes the hot water will bleed through. So be careful!"
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I've only had this for a month and used it a few times, but it's great! I have no complaints. It was exactly what I was looking for. Fits into my small pot perfectly. Easy to clean, easy to store."
5,Insightful look into the tragedy of a life...,"I have always been intriqued by the life of MA and have read many books over the years on her life and the French Revolution. Very facinating! I thought this book was a most insightful look into her world as first the Dauphine & then Queen, a girl & then woman and the property of the French Royalty whose 'sole purpose' was to produce a male heir...a Dauphin. The author helps one to understand the complexities of her priviledged cocoon in the beautiful palace of Versailles and the driving forces as she seems determined to undermine her whole world with many foolish & selfish choices. If you love history this book is well written & a comfortable read. One of my favorites on MA."
1,This is not Sonicflood,"What a crushing blow to finally get the CD, shred the wrapping, jam it in and then you'll find out something is wrong. This is not Sonicflood in every sense of the word and is false advertising to even call this a Sonicflood release. Every member of the ""band"" is new, not a single original member can be found. My advice is to pass on the disc and get the new Kevin Max or Michael Tait CDs instead. Get the 2 CD Delirious disc, just don't be fooled by this CD."
5,New Sonicflood is refreshing and anointed!,"The new CD, Resonate from Sonicflood is an amazing piece of work. They've taken a lot of flack for the numerous personnel changes in the band since their first CD, but this Sonicflood are a talented group with an anointed ministry. They've led numerous kids to Christ through their concerts, and this CD helps to capture what the live show is all about. Worship in the 21st Century! If you look past the fact of the member changes, and see the hearts of this group, you surely will be as blessed as I have been by their ministry and by this CD!"
1,Sonic rip-off,"This is not the REAL Sonicflood. This album has no similarity to the original Sonicflood except the name. These new guys have made a lame attempt at reproducing the spirit of worship of the original Sonicflood, and their insincerity shows through. (..)none of the guys on the original album played on this <Resonate> album, and none of the <Resonate> musicians played on the original album. Pure disappointment. Don't waste your money."
2,"Should've called themselves ""Sonicflood Revisited""","I was like so many who bought this CD thinking it was the original band line-up. I was disappointed, of course, and my initial listening still holds true. Yes, this album has a good rockin' sound, but this is nothing like the real Sonicflood. The new band line-up captures none of the essence of Jeff Deyo's band. Under another name, this version could've probably won critical acclaim. Cashing in on a recognizable name, however, was a mistake. Take the same guys back into the studio, give them another name, and try again.In the meantime, if it's the REAL Sonicflood you want... buy Jeff Deyo's CD ""Saturate""."
2,"Nope, sorry. Not as good as the original","Even though I knew Jeff Deyo (original SF lead singer) had left the group, I naively assumed the other original members had stayed behind. To my surprise, I found that the group was completely ""re-cast."" But I figured, ""Maybe they're still moving in the same spirit.""Uh, not totally.Sure, the same sincerity of the original group was still there, but not the same passion. This album is full of weird arrangements and forgettable songs. I really don't like it, and that's saying A LOT for me because usually I love praise music with an alternative edge to it (such as delirious? and Third Day).It's too bad for the new SonicFlood because I'm sure their hearts were in the right places and I know they must have worked hard for this album. But (and there's always that ""but"") they're not the same SonicFlood I fell in love with. And that's a terrible shame."
4,Hmmm...,"This is an pretty good cd. I've gotta admit, I was taken back at first by how different just the first song was that I almost didn't listen to the rest of the cd. After that, I almost didn't listen to it again. But this is just the kind of thing that has to grow on you, I guess. I've never really been one for ANY dance/techno music, especially with worship. But, again, it grows on you. As far as the worship aspect goes, if you're truly worshiping God, it shouldn't change your worship because you're singing out of the overflow of your heart's love, not out of your taste of music. Anyways, I would go for the cd, just be prepared for something really different from typical worship. God bless."
5,Amazing,"""The Blood in my Body"" is a fantastic EP and I can't stop listening to it. I can't wait to hear more from JF Robitaille."
3,Not scary enough for me.,"The author probably did the best he could with the information he had at hand, but my expectations were high and I was left a little disappointed..Although H.H. Holmes was a fascinating character that did gruesome things, this story didn't really take me there. I wanted to know more about the gory details, and I felt this book lacked a chilly telling of the facts. I wanted to be scared, instead I was bored with uninteresting details that seemed to be filler."
2,Not the first by a long shot,"H. H Holmes one more time. Ok, but the first? Lee Ah Bow who killed six in Old New York. How about a woman serial poisoner tried in the Province of Maryland in the 17th century. H. H. was far from the first."
2,America's SEVENTH serial killer,"This account is untrustworthy simply because it calls Herman Webster Mudgett, AKA H.H. Holmes, America's first serial killer. There were a least six before him. True, he was one of the most colorful because of his killing ground, but he was by no means the most prolific, the most sensational, or the first."
5,Strap yourself in for a loooooooooong ride!,"I have read many books out there about serial killers, mass murders, as well as being a criminal justice major. The topic of perverse, hateful, and demented individuals really gets my blood flowing. Don't take that wrong of course. This book I might add does just the trick. Schechter, one of my favorite authors on the subject, leads us down a path in which there is no turning back from. Once you find out about the amazing Mr. H.H. HOlmes...the ""other"" serial killers look like an old pair of panties that your great grandmother used to wear. READ THIS BOOK. I am about to embark on the journey once more...because it is immensely gratifying...(if you're interested in these kooks of course!)"
4,castle of horrors,"H.H. Holmes commited his crimes in the late 19th century in Chicago. It's incredible how Harold Schechter has been able to write such a detailed account on this monster. Another must-read.The dapper, charming Holmes, as he was described by the people who knew him, was also a liar, bigamist and a murderer. How many people were murdered in his 'castle', no one will ever know. Schechter's description of the castle is chillingly good. It feels like you're hiding in a corner, watching how Holmes is walking around, inspecting every room while commiting his grotesque crimes.The book could have done without the detailled descriptions of Holmes' travels around the country. It tends to get a bit boring, certainly when, in the next chapter, the investigators revisit the same places. The middle of the book is a bit repetitive. Nevertheless, a well written true crime book."
3,"Tis Good,","I like this book. It gives a good review of the times. It is more of a Novel than an informative peice on H.H.Holmes like the Devil in the White City was. Of course that was a good book if there wasn't two books thrown together.So if you like to read to enjoy, this is a good book. If you are just looking for quick information like I was, it is a mediocre book.Enjoy"
4,A wild ride with a unique psychotic,"There have been killers and con-men and thieves and dead-beats in America throughout its long history, but I don't think there has ever been anyone before or since like the subject of this long book. The history of H. H. Holmes is so complex, and with so many gaps, that Schechter has done an amazing job in managing to tell a more-or-less coherent story. Holmes himself never told the truth about anything, no matter how trivial, while his own caution and incessant travel kept much of his crime anonymous or undetected. Even in his early days, when he maintained more fixed addresses, his crimes were largely undetected--- there is no way to know how many people he murdered in a special building in a suburb of Chicago during the days of the Exposition, when he rented rooms to travellers who were never seen or heard from again. A continually fascinating book."
3,De-Drug Out,It has a lot of good information but it just seems to drag. The best part came from the information dealing with the trial.
3,I am sure its a nice sheet - but very expensive for just a sheet,For not much more you can get a whole set for your bed. I was under the impression this was what I was getting - I didn't read closely enough for this product.
3,Ultra Gatorskin 26 x 1 1/8,"I decided to upgrade the tires on our tandem from a less expensive 26 x 1.3 Continental tire to the Continental Ultra Gatorskin 26 x 1 1/8. We had ridden nearly 1,000 miles on the old tires this summer without a tire related incident. On our 3rd ride using the Ultra Gatorskin we experienced a flat tire. A piece of wire with a blunt tip similar to a heavier gauge paper clip had punctured the tire and the kevlar belt. I had thought the kevlar belt was suppose to minimize puncture type flats.Anyway, thus far I must say I am a bit disappointed in the Continental Ultra Gatorskin."
4,Fiesta Java Mug,We purchased one each of the Sunflower and Paprika cups. Overall we like the mugs - they are a good size and comfortable to use for our morning coffee.We were disappointed that the colors we received were not as saturated as the pictures showed. The handle was chipped in the first shipment received due to poor packaging. Amazon replaced the broken mug quickly. Should the chipping continue I will update this review.
1,Price is too high,"I've been price checking all over the web and this is the highest price I've found for the java mug...sorry, won't be buying here."
4,Fiestaware Mugs,"In an attempt to get RED coffee mugs, I ordered two ""cinnibar"" Fiestaware coffee mugs. While they are in the red family, the color has too much brown in it for me. I wish Fiestaware would produce a true red shade.Other than that,they were fine. Price reduction didn't mean much once the s&h; were added. Could have driven to the store, paid regular price and still gotten them for less. My fault for being lazy."
1,not 12 oz,This is not a 12oz mug as advertised. It is a standard small 10oz mug into which you can get ~11oz if you fill it to near the top.
2,Tiny cracks,"I have a lot of fiesta ware and have been very happy with it but one of the white mugs I ordered had tiny cracks, almost like crazing on the inside at the top."
3,"Nice mug, but.......","This mug arrived in good shape, but the color ""Sunflower"" shown here at Amazon appears quite a bit brighter than the color of the mug I received. I know there are differences due to the web or my computer, but I'm still disappointed."
1,Not real Fiestaware?,"Just a comment that this doesn't appear to be authentic Homer Laughlin Fiestaware. I'm sitting here with a 12-oz Fiestaware mug right now, and the shape is slightly different, and the handle is entirely different. The mug on offer here may or may not be a good mug, but I am not sure it is what it is advertised to be."
3,"Okay mugs, but doesn't keep coffee hot for long.","Not sure why, but coffee does not stay hot long in these. Comfortable handles though."
1,DIY upgrade,"This product is highly overrated and priced! However I was able to save the product by installing a small convex mirror below the ""projector"" lamp, what a crock to call that tiny thing a projector lamp is outrageous. The mirror is available at most auto parts stores, put that in and you'll get the sky result that you expected."
1,Dim Plastic piece of junk,"Save your money, and avoid this, you wont be able to see a darn thing. A great concept that simple did not work, you cant see a thing, and it certainly does not look like a night sky. Takes lots of batteries, and wa-laa, absolutely nothing happens, what a disappointment."
3,Trouble with Delivery,I ordered two Uncle Milton SDUM Starse Preimium Star Theater.The box arrived and there was only one order.I called the shipping company and they promised to send before Christmas as it was a gift. Did not receive until the week after.....Have not heard back from the recipient of the gift yet
3,"Good, but has some downfalls","I've read the book twice over a two year period. The book has some very interesting parts pacificly when talking about Candide, his early years, and threw the 50's. Then, mid-way threw the book it becomes tedios to read, and Secrests' not being able to use the Bernstein family archives becomes apparent and the book is not very interesting to read as well as not being well written. Still if you are a Leonard Bernstein fan the book would still be worth reading just not buying. Go to the library for this one."
3,Why isn't this great?,"I'm a huge McLaughlin fan, and having been blown away by ""My Goals Beyond,"" the album he made right after this, I expected that this cd would reach the same heights. Why wouldn't it? Psychadelic+Buddy Miles+McLaughlin+loose jams=something amazing, right? Well, I was left pretty disappoined as the jams are so loose and meandering (not to mention sloppily editied), that one waits for something cool to happen the entire album with no payoff. The only real point of interest is the first appearance of McLaughlin's great riff ""Marbles."" However, the version on ""Carlos Santana and Buddy Miles Live"" is FAR superior."
2,Exceptionally blurry!,"Well, it boils down to this: if you like blurry photos, you'll probably like this book. They are all blurry and/or out of focus and/or doubly-exposed. I know this is supposed to be one of the ""artistic"" (""arty"" is more like it) styles of the day, but I happen to like a bit more clarity and definition in photos. And for page after page after page . . . truly, if you've looked at one of these photos, you've looked at them all. One hardly ever sees the bloody bull except as a blur the size of a cat. As for the essays, all that information can easily be found in other, much cheaper, sources. So, even with the generous Amazon discount, this over-priced and cumbersome volume is a major disappointment."
2,Authors/Tech Editor can't read instruments correctly,"I am moderator for the Sun City AZ Computer Club's Flight Simulation Special Interest Group (SIG). We have over 50 members that meet twice a month for instruction/demo's/exp. sharing. Thought this book would be a great text for a class next fall. Bought 5 copies for key member review. Noted so many errors in a cursory review of chapter 4 ( instrument ID)and 7 ( ILS) alone that we cannot trust it's content in it's present form. Strongly suggest publisher make an errata sheet available on the internet for individuals who have purchased it, Have existing unsold copies recalled/destroyed, and a corrected version reissued. This was a great idea that went wrong. Shame on TWA Captain Gwinn."
3,This should be the game manual,"This is the book I expected when bought FS98. You learn how to use the game: communications, weather generation and the basic rules of IFR: types of airports, restricted areas, differences flying in VFR and IFR. Don't expect any map to fly in this book, there is none."
1,written in a hurry and it shows,"contains too many important textual errors to help the new IFR pilot: misspellings (and substitutions, i.e. altitude when attitude was intended), incorrect captions, and plain wrong information. go to the local small airport, and get a book written to teach real IFR techniques. the rest is in the FS98 help files."
3,Good Reference,"This book may not be perfect on Instrumental Flight but for Flight Simulator Fans, it is a good introduction. Although this is for the FS98 version, I think it is still useful for the Flight Simulator X. This is also the only book for FS on the topic. I will recommend this."
3,Just what I was looking for.,"This book instructs the reader in how to use your IFR navigation instruments and develop IFR skills for Microsoft Flight Simulator.This is an excellent book to have as a written reference. For an old-fashioned guy like me who likes to have something printed in hand, this is an excellent book.This book is of course for people who really want to get into knowing how to do IFR in Flight Simulator. It is not a 'basic training' book about basic flight maneuvers and basic novice information. The book is specialized and written as if you already know how to fly moderatley well (in Flight Simulator that is)."
1,Nothing You Don't Already Have,Much of this book is just a rehash of what is included in Microsoft's online help files included with Flight Simulator. Basically you are paying for a printed version of the on-line manual. Hardly worth 20 bucks.
4,Service that is fast and efficient,I am so glad that Amazon is delivering to South Africa again. I lost the first 45 pages of this book in our school library some time ago. What a pleasure to have this book as good as new on my shelf! This is a super historical publication. Anyone interested in the history of flying will thrilled by this book.
5,Love It!,"After shopping in my neighborhood for a fixture, I found this on-line at Amazon. Could not believe how beautiful it was - even nicer than I expected! Very much worth what I paid. Fast shipping too."
2,"""My opinion.""","""This product is supposed to link with my cell phone, and computer at the same time, but the blue tooth link on my phone streams music as well, so they do not work at the same time. If I am listening to the computer I can not have my phone connected, and the other way around as well, so this device does not do exactly what it claims to do."""
2,Anycom Bluetooth Stereo Headset,"I am rather new to the Bluetooth technology, but I finally got it to link with my phone and also my computer. All was going well until I wanted to listen to my music on the computer. Sound was great, but it kept cutting in and out. Very frustrating. I emailed the company, but have yet to hear back from them. I'm sending this back."
4,karate lesson and adventure story rolled into one book,Max and his friends are about to take off for a special secret mission. They must use their karate skills to defeat the darkest force in the universe. Will they be able to pull it off. Of corse they can all it takes is courage and skill. These are qualities that all the memebers of the The Black Belt club have so they will win the fight! In the back of the book are steps by step drawing teaching kids some basic karate moves!The type in the book was fairly large. Readers who are just starting chapter book will enjoy this feature of the book. It also has some great comic book style drawings appear through out the book!Yes Children who enjoy karate and adventure book will enjoy this book. It's nuber 1 in a series so kids will want to look for the books that follow it!
3,Leaves much unsaid,Minimal descriptions with powerful eye for detail. Tells the story of a recently divorced father and his son traveling to India for the summer to stay with his parents. The divorce was a crushing blow for all and much of the story (and the writing) largely relies on the tension of what is left unsaid.
1,Extremely Slow- moving,"I found myself getting tired of this novel barely 40 pages into the novel. Though it is less than 200 pages, it was such a drag as it lacks a plot. No matter how poetic and sharp the prose may be, there is no way that I can trawl through the novel without wishing the end is just the next page. What a waste of my time! I subsequently read a few of the reviews of the author's other book- Three Novels and found that some reviewers also share the same sentiment - that his novels lack a credible plot."
3,A sad saga of a directionless region,"Amit Chaudhuri's novels are mostly on Calcutta. The truely New World being created elsewhere evades Calcutta's attention. The city where the US based professor of economics Joyojit Chatterjee's parents live and he may have to return there every year regularly, demonstrates a strikingly meaningless form of life. Only an efficient bank employee (a true rarity there) once asked him about the meaning of his name( which in Bengali means Win over victory). Otherwise nobody questions the extremely irritating and frustrating developments in that communist ruled city. There is no certainity anywhere, everybody making self-depricating cynic observations. Though alienated and aware, Joyojit is certainly affected at the end. At the airport, he hesitates to tell his co-passenger who is from Boston, that he is from this city. To the rest of the world this may be a newly found world drifting away from the new world."
3,Could have been better,"Amit Chaudhuri is absolutely brilliant when it comes to breathing life into everyday stuff like visiting a bank, taking a walk or frying fish. This skill is a lot more germane for a novel like A Strange and Sublime Address. But in a book on a serious subject like divore and its aftermath his quotitidan observations are more of a distration than anything. I wish he had dealt with the emotional undercurrents more openly and at the same level of detail as mundane things like watching TV or toothpaste or bath soap."
1,"Should be called ""GNOME for Red Hat Linux 6 fast & easy""",This book is not about Red Hat Linux 6. It is about Gnome! Gnome is a GUI that comes with Red Hat 6. Gnome looks like Windows 95 but is more like Win 3.1 as it is just a shell to the operating system. If you know the basics about GUI interfaces like any of the Windows products then you do not need this book. I was expecting more about command line information. This book is like buying a book called Microsoft Dos 6 and getting the manual for Microsoft Windows 3.1. If you are looking for a book about Gnome and do not know anything about other GUIs then this book is for you.
1,Too lite!,"There was very little, if any, substance to this book. Pages are filled with large screen shots of self-evident, follow-the-menu tasks. It was a total waste of money."
3,Not a bad start,"This is not a bad start for someone new to RedHat Linux, but wants to get in on the ""new"" OS. Think of it as the basic ""Let's Get Started"" manual that should ship with the distro CDs in the first place. It might help Linux newbies get over their fear and try Linux out."
4,Good book for Linux greenhorns,"This book is recommended for non techno people who know nothing about Linux and just want to get a feel of a non windows OS. It offers step by step instructions with graphics on how to work on the Gnome desktop. Overall, this is a good book for Linux greenhorns although I think its title is misleading. It should read 'Gnome GUI Fast and Easy.'"
1,Not much more to say about it...,"It is not worth the paper it's printed on. If you like GNOME enough to use it, then you probably know enough about it not to need the book.. wait a sec.. if you knew nothing about a computer and never heard of linux.. you wouldn't need this book! :-P"
1,This book is full of misinformation.,"This book is focused on GNOME rather then RedHat 6. The title of the book is the first major mistake made.I was looking for a GNOME book that is easy enough to follow so my studnts will actually use. Therefore, I need a book with big pictures and fewer discussion on concepts. Basically what we need is a hand on book that can familar the students with the lab equipment and the application software in about 3 hours. Therefore, the GNOME interface and big pictures in the book is actually a plus. Sadly, that is about the only benifits of the book.When this book finally arrive, I took a good look at it. 3 random chapters later, after following the instruction on the book to the letter, I found this book to be full of problems. The major problems resides in 1) several instruction on how to complete the task is wrong; 2) the method it use took the long complex way. The misinformation on the book render it useless even though it is only about 20% to 25% of the contents."
4,25 to Life on my shelf,"25 to Life is one of the few games I actually liked. I spent a good four hours playing it this morning (D*mmit, I spend that time a week or so on a game!) It was interesting to play as a cop or a gangster (Not a huge fan of the law in real life) so I had fun playing both for the heck of it.It's no GTA, but it's pretty solid, though the story isn't too hot in my opinion. Controls are a dream to me, but it depends on how you like them, combat is kind of dull, uninteresting, but I'm interested in the story even though it doesn't appeal to me, it's average for me, but I'll leave the gameplay to you, happy gaming!"
1,WARNING TO PARENTS,"Parents, this game scores points for shooting cops and more points if you grab an innocent person off the street and use them as a human shield."
1,This game should be locked up for life.,"Truthfully I can't believe that I paid for this game, when i saw it in the store i thought it would be pretty sweet, ya know reading that back of the case and looking at the pictures, but obviously whats on the case doesn't well describe what actually happens. There's really no point to the game, every level is pretty much the same just with different people and slightly different weapons. The incentive for finishing the game is some retarded survival level. The only thing that i found interesting about the game is that you can take hostages and peoples heads literally get blown off when shot the right way. I would recommend anyone looking to buy this game wait until it is a Greatest Hits (I doubt) or buy it used."
1,Generic in a boring way,"I used to wonder how people could be so far off base when it comes to developing these games especially considering that this game was developed in Utah. Now you and I both know that when it comes to urban culture and all things street you need look no further than the UT for your definitive source, but that still doesn't explain the lacklustre graphics and clunky mechanics and poor coordination since we all know that Utah is home to the best artists and athletes around I mean just look at the Jazz. Yes, I am Utah bashing, yes I am from Utah, that is why I find it hilariously sad that these developers chose to make a game about urban gang-warfare and street culture. Stick to what you know, make a game about scrapbooking and holding hands it couldn't possiblly suck as bad as this."
2,So much shooting...it gets old.,"This game, overall isn't half bad. It has some what of a story line and quite a few levels. However I am too used to the free roam of some other shooting games, where as in this game you have a set path with barriers (usually buildings) on both sides of you that keep you going in one direction. Also there isnt much of stealth in this game, its basically run and shoot. The guns all seem to work some what the same as eachother and aren't very impressive in my opinion. The game was just a little too repetative for my taste. If you are a big fan of shooting games like me, you probably aren't going to be impressed by this game...at all."
1,should get the deth penalty not life,"this game is a real insult to gta (grand theft auto).the grafics are horible the gameplay is crap. have you seen the ai? they must have dropped out of special ed class in elementry. they shoot eachother and set themselves on fire. the game just plain sucks. oh did i mention sterio types? a bunch of white wanabe rapper develapers try to act like they know street lingo which they don't. the game is just full of bing bling,f words and poor voice acting. for example:you better get flowers and a funeral because im comming. what the hell was that? you call that voice acting? well the point is don't buy it or rent it. do yourself a fave and buy a gta game. trust me you will thank yourself."
3,They're okay,"From the picture, I thought these shoes would be more atheletic looking, but I was wrong. I was not too happy when I opened the box and saw how plain their appearance was. They are comfortable, but I don't think I gave them too much of a chance due to their appearance. I am a shoe aficionado and I wasn't too pleased...only with appearance. Everything else was fine! I guess it depends on your taste in shoes and fashion. Me being the stylist and fashionist that I am, I made it work with a nice pair of tight long jeans to where the shoes weren't seen as much. Now they are just another box for me to add to my count of shoes. I doubt if this pair will get much ""walking time"" from me!"
1,Early Australian Recordings....Warning!,"This sixteen set of early Australian cuts are a nice introduction to the early Bee Gees sound and songwriting, but it is not as well mixed or mastered as ""Brilliant From Birth"" (a two disc CD with 63 songs). Also note that the cover photo is circa 1967-1968 and these songs had nothing to do with Colin Peterson and Vince Melouney; later Bee Gees band members. <Trivia>"
3,just a few songs i enjoyed on this cd,some of the songs just might have been god if performed by another grou
4,Interesting book; disjointed presentation,"An interesting and easy to read first person perspective from a former German officer. Grossjohann enlisted in the late 1920s and finished the war in 1945 as a major. It provides insight into what it was like to fight at the tactical level in Poland, the Russian Front, and the west. He fought against the Poles (limited action), the Russians (quite a bit), the Americans, and the French. Provides insight into the steadily decreasing capabilities of German units as the war progressed.Unfortunately the book is a bit disjointed as it jumps from experience to experience, with the odd sidebar thrown in. Fortunately there is an attempt to put Grossjohann's battles into the larger picture so the reader has some context."
3,Good but brief,Interesting details but a very short book. Although it is 250 pages (twenty of which are appendices) more than half is a historical commentary by Keith Bonn and Wolf Zoepf. The historical commentary is a nice review of war events to frame Georg's comments but it means that book contains only about 100 pages of Georg's rememberances. The historical commentary is good but not 100% accurate. Georg's comments are not very flattering to the German military and many are stray comments about (civilian) women that he met.
3,An average German soldier's story of the war.,"This was indeed a brief view of the war by a German officer's point of view. Grossjohann served in the Polish, French, and Russian invasions and fought American troops on the Western front. He states that the German Army had very capable officers with dedicated soldiers. However the quantity of enemy never disappeared, and as casualties mounted, fewer and fewer officers were available to command the lesser number of soldiers. It was surprising that Grossjohann was in an officer's training course at the end of the war, when these soldiers were so desparately needed at the front.The stories in this book never caught my imagination. They relate the story of an officer in an infantry division fighting both a terrible enemy and bureaucracy. In fact, much of the book relates a few experiences plus his disgust at his fellow officers. This is probably the experience of most German officers in the war. However, this was not page flipping material. An OK read."
4,Now I need to learn to read German,"I picked up Five Years, Four Fronts by Georg Grossjohan the other day at my local bookstore. It turns out it is not quite what I was led to believe but it is still very enjoyable. The book is broken down into snippets of time where the editor starts an overview of the military situation in and around the 198th Infantry Division throughout the war then goes to ""...Georg remembers..."" which goes into his thoughts about the events during that time. I've read quite a few books about WWII but never before have I read a book that has implanted in me the desire to learn another language so I can read all of that person's memoirs. If you see this one on the shelf or online do yourself a favor and buy it!"
1,messed up masterpiece,"I was fooled by the price of this DVD and the phoney advertising claim that this was a new remastered edition and the title being in Italian made me think this would be a superior transfer and in the original language but not so! The picture quality is hazy and poor, the motion is distorted like watching on a cheap computer and it is dubbed. Stay away from this company!"
1,Not the real thing.,This product was a bad copy of the actual movie. There was a major delay between the mouth movements and the actual voices. I wish that amazon would have let me know the this CD was a copy of the movie and not the actual movie. You made what should have beed a great movie expericence and bad movie expericence.
1,AWFUL - THE QUALITY IS JUST AWFUL,"The quality of the DVD is absolutely awful. Substandard in every accounts, image, sound not even in the original language. The write up indicates that it is a ""remastered"" copie this is a big lie. It is unwatchable."
3,good,"I could copy the review I wrote for the first volume: this is an interesting story, fast paced with lovable characters (a bit bigger than life) and a lot of explicit sex.Flaws are just the same: skinny, un-Japanese-looking boys, confused paging, obsession for roles in sex. In this second volume I felt the role played by media in the lovers' relationship to be overwhelming.It is pleasing to read but buy it second hand if you can."
4,Bruce on Paul,"I purchased this book for a class requirement. That said, Bruce does a good job without being too professorial. Overall, an easy read and very thorough."
3,"Not for the casual reader, nor those curious about Paul","I don't wish to rain on the parade of laudatory reviews but feel obliged to pass along the following: reading a book on Paul by A.N. Wilson made me feel like I was reading about him within flashes of lightening. It was an exciting encounter; maybe even an echo of what the man himself said about his experience on the way to Damascus. I bought this book wanting more Paul, but got way more theology and dry history and references to particular Scripture passages in addition to, a whole lot about Paul. So, for the curious, or the relatively-new-to-theological-writing, this is not for you. Try the A.N. Wilson bio. For the more advanced? Do like me, pay attention to those who know more on the topic, and keep slugging your way through the book.It's good for you."
2,"""Special Edition"" a glorified demo","Dont' get the Serious Sam: The First Encounter Special Edition. The ""Special Edition"" is basically a glorified demo version of the full version. It only comes with 7 of the 15 full-version levels and not all the weapons present in the full-version are present in this version. I recommend getting the full-version."
2,This is a demo!,"I also bought it without paying much attention, so i found out later that it was just a demo. Still a nice game, but i would buy the regular version."
5,"Great series, can't wait until season 2 comes to DVD","We really enjoy Bill Envall's comedy, but living in the UK, we get to see precious little of his work. So we were pleased to see he had his own series available on DVD and weren't disappointed. It's great fun, with really likeable characters - this is well observed comedy and anyone with teenage kids will recognise many of the situations. It started slowly in the early episodes, but got better and better and it's just a shame that there were only 8 episodes in series 1. It left us really wanting more!I read that the show has just started a second series on TV in the US, so hopefully there will be more episodes to enjoy this year and roll on the release of series 2 on DVD so that we can enjoy it here in the UK too!Well done Bill."
4,not bad,Cd was scratched but played fine. Jennifer Lawrence is a babe. did think she was in it but she was!!! Loved the product. now waiting for the new seasons to be released
2,compared to,"I seen a little of the show, it's kind of life watching malcolm in the middle, according to jim and still standing. This show belonged on fox more than tbs. Bill is good comic, but a terrible actor."
3,Sitcom,"Thanks to the writers strike,there isn't much to watch on tv for the summer 08 season.So the alternative is too buy shows like this one to watch instead.The Bill Engvall Show is a typical sitcom produced by TBS,and its not a reality show,imagine that!"
3,Broadway-style comedy of post-war Jewish-French Paris?,"Back home in Paris just freed from German occupants tailor revived his family business by deploying a mostly Jewish staff rich of the Holocaust memories.A story of relationships and survivals in post-war-second France then still infested with local anti-Semitic Nazi-Hitler supporters at all levels of bureaucracy, where family duties left space for lust and outside sex affairs.At all merits it looks like a sort of a comedy rather than a drama of a post-war Western European Jewry returned into nothing."
5,Be sure to watch Seniorita Justice if.....,"..... you have a case of alvinolagnia and enjoy watching blue-jean baby queens who can kick butt. The plot, based upon a woman's need to avenge the killing of her brother, is bettered by her desire to follow God's Will in so doing. My five-star rating is based upon these parameters alone."
4,Senorita Justice,Movie was well acted and the actors portrayed their parts in such a manner as to lead a person into believing the story. I enjoyed the movie.
3,"5 stars for Edith Gonzalez, 2 for everything else.....averages a 3 star","First off, the one good thing about this movie is EDITH GONZALEZ who plays the detective in charge of the murder of high powered lawyer Ana (Yancy Medina), whos brother is murdered. Great acting on Edith's part! Everyone else, just ok, with the exception of Eva Longoria who barely has a role so there's not much to judge.To clear one thing up, I've read the reviews written here and most have gotten Edith Gonzalez, who plays the detective, confused with Yancy Medina who plays Ana Rios, the supposed star of this movie.Overall this is a regular movie, not great, not horrible."
1,Wonderful Movie,"This movie was, without hyperbole, the greatest movie ever made. The acting was realistic and emotional. The use of ""Spanglish"" throughout the movie really reinforces to me the fact that, yes, these people really are Hispanic! The low-budget filming gave it a realistic touch and I adored the ""street names"" like Bones and Lefty. The plot reminded me of Swiss cheese, so I had a lot of room for interpretation, which is tons of fun and lets the director/writer off the hook! I learned tons of new swear words - even ones in Spanish! I saw at least 7 dead bodies! ¡Que fantastico!"
3,No captions,"I am a big fan of George Eliot, especially Silas Marner. However, this series doesn't have captions. I am hearing impaired and really depend on captions, so I was a bit disappointed when I couldn't produce any from this set."
5,Unsurpassed Victorian dama.,"These are all accurate dramatizations of these excellent George Eliot novels. Were these theater films rather than TV series, they would deserve Oscars in many categories. Though nothing could fully convey the novels themselves, these film series should encourage many to read the originals--as intended. Highly recommended."
3,A bit disappointing,"The mail time was quick, and the packaging was fine. It's the quality of the DVD's I have a problem with. Some are quite good, but two are poor quality. I expected a bit more than this."
3,Some were better than others.,The Elliot Collection was ok not great. I would have rather watched on the Tv and not buy it. Once vieded was enough.
5,Eye opening,"This CD is rich in mood, deep in thought and emotion and ultimately depressing. Still, it has kept my attention for 17 years and remains an incredible work of music."
5,"Tale of terror from a teacher's, and students', POVs.","It must be scary to be a teacher, and this book explores one scenario that would make any educator shiver and squirm. Well-written and fast-paced, this book was worth the time and the money. I've known kids like Mistie, and was rooting for her throughout the ordeal. In spite of the horror, there was an underlying sympathy for all three main characters in the book. Now, where are they keeping Massie's next novel? I'm more than ready."
3,"Well written, but low on horror","Elizabeth Massie has written countless short horror stories for people of all ages. Her third Lesiure title, WIRE MESH MOTHERS, is fast paced and exciting, but I am not sure why it is considered a 'horror' novel. A teenage girl with a gun takes a school teacher and a young abused girl hostage. The premise is more like an ABC-movie of the week than it is in line with other Leisure Horror titles. This work is very well written with interesting characters, but is in no way a horror story! Go figure."
4,Good for Back,I bought this for My girlfriend and her husband for their first baby. They both have back problems and both raved about this product. The said they had no pain while wearing it and that the weight was very much equally distributed.
3,Should have bought the Kelty...,"We purchased this because our daughter had outgrown the front carrier that we received at my baby shower. I thought this was a great price for a backpack! I guess you get what you pay for.This pack wasn't sturdy enough for my me or my husband to feel comfortable with her in it for long. She's 14 months and about 26 lbs. She fits, but she leans back due to lack of adequate support.There are a lot of straps, but we figured it out. It certainly doesn't get points for ease of use though.We'll keep it because it's unisex, and we can use it for the next baby as a front or hip carrier. I still may end up buying the Kelty."
5,great book,I am Cherokee and was looking for a book that would help me understand the ancient ways and symbols of native americans from all the different tribes and I highly recomend this book
4,Yoga for chickens,"Small easy to read book,someinteresting section for thought.Easy and straightforward and I recieved good service with my order."
4,Suchet is the Best Poirot!,"David Suchet is the best Poirot ever. These are great videos and stories; however, Acorn Media really needs to start including closed captioning or subtitles. My wife, who is nearly totally deaf, likes the A&E versions because they include closed captioning. When we watch Acorn Media, I have to stop, explain what's going on and then continue on."
4,Thanks Amazon Prime,I have long been a fan of Hercule Poirot. How can you not love such an entertaining show. It stimulates the 'little gray cells'.
1,Out Dated information!,"The fears exploited in this video have now been shown to be baseless by 5 years of experience in the State of Oregon with a legal hastened death law. Foolish statements in this video such as ""assisted suicide is contagious"" are proven wrong by Oregon Health Department statistics. Vulnerable populations have not rushed to use the law. Perhaps the death of this video should be hastened."
4,Belated review....,"Fantastic set except for the packaging, mine was falling apart the day I opened it."
1,Lady Day: The Best of Billie Holiday,"Disappointed in CD--not what I expected. Have heard better of hers. Just doesn't do her voice justice--no power, and these are suppossed to be the best of Billie Holiday. Don't think so."
4,Good compilation,All I miss is the energy on the live recordings.The studio classics are a little lame.
5,A Coast to Coast Walk,A great book for planning and walking across England. It has all the details necessary and is written in a humorous vein. The personal drawings and asides add to the light-hearted approach. Really necessary for the details of the walk.
3,Beware of buying this from Kindle,This is an excellent historical piece... but the one Kindle is selling is badly faded and illegible in places... so you are getting a second rate product for your money... please be aware of this.
3,really small,i have never used my handle. i had no idea how small it would be. it might fit a small triangular thread file.
4,The Batman- The Complete Third Season.........,"Season Three introduces Batgirl into the fold and puts Batman against the likes of Posion Ivy, Maxie Zeus, Toymaker, Gearhead, Prank, Temblor, and D.A.V.E.. The season also seen the change in theme music for the show which is more of a cross between the old Batman theme from the 60s & the Hawaii Five-O theme. The storylines seem to be getting alot better as we see The Batman finally getting his craft as a crimefighter down. He doesn't accept the need for a partner in Batgirl til the end of the season, which is good because Robin comes into the fold the next season. Danielle Judovits, Will Friedle, Piera Coppola, Phil Lamarr, Patton Oswalt, Michael Weisz, Jim Cumming and Jeff Bennett all provide vocal talent for the season. It just keeps getting better."
3,subtitle?,"hi! i'm a french buyer, someone could tell if in the third season box, french language & subtitle are available, before i bought! many thanks for the answer!!!!!!"
2,Bad First Disc AsWell,"Just like the reviewer before me, the 1st disc of The Batman The Complete Third Season would not play. At first I thought the problem was a fluke and returned it for a replacement but the replacement has the exact same problem too. At this point I'm getting refund, which is a real shame because I was looking forward to the 3rd season. I'll probably wait a few months for this problem to be fixed and try again. Two stars simply because the 1st disc is not functional."
2,hmm not vey good,This is batman for people that dont actually like batman. The animated series all four series were dark and brooding where as this is complete garbage. Yeah better for the kids but lets be honest batman is for adults. Dont like the rock action soundtrack or the bad voice acting and plotting. nice batmobile though.
2,Check Discs Carefully Please,"Well I could not wait to get the third season. I bought it Tuesday, but the first disc would not play. I returned it today. The first disc would not play. I returned for a refund and went to another store. All of the first discs in the season three discs we opened would not play. Not sure if it is a format problem or region problem. So check both discs when you first get it.I hope they straighten out the problem soon.Anyone else find this problem with the season set they got?2 Stars because of bad disc.When I finally get a set that plays: 5 stars."
4,Still great fun,"Reading all the reviews of Season 3 here, I can't but think that a lot of people take this show way too seriously. When the show debuted, it took heat from fans because it wasn't the same as the admittedly-great animated series of the 90's. Now, even fans who've finally admitted The Batman is a good show are complaining that season 3 isn't on par with 1 and 2.Well, I for one am continuing to enjoy how the creators have redefined Batman & Co. once again. Pairing Barbara Gordon and Pamela Isley--right before destiny changes both their lives in a single night--was just plain cool. And while a handful of new villains can't really match the classic rogues' gallery, who wants to see the same villains over & over? I mean, is it just me, or does Arkham Asylum need to re-think their security system?The Batman continues to impress with its kinetic visual style, and smart (but not too smart) take on a classic character. Lighten up and just have fun."
3,Problems with the disc....,"As many others have stated, I have returned this season twice without any luck. Disc one just won't play. I am hoping that this problem will be fixed soon so that I can actually watch the first 7 episodes of this season."
5,Hi I'm Batgirl and I'm Here to Change Your Theme Song,"Batgirl is EXACTLY what this incarnation of the Batman needed. The stories are better, ALL the characters are more interesting, and Batman seems a LOT more balanced.Batman CAN be good when the story is dark, but only certain writers have been able to pull it off in the past. I did not much care for seasons 1 & 2.These writers discovered their stories need Batgirl. Season 3 is a huge leap forward. I think they should have renamed the series ""The Batgirl"" but that's just me."
4,Bat Man 3rd Season is a very good dvd for kids....and adults!,"I got this dvd for my Grandson's birthday and he absolutely loves it. In fact, his whole family watches it with him and all enjoy it. Just think, 3 generations enjoying the same movie. Keep up the good work."
4,Great Addition To Collection,"Our son loves ""The Batman"" series. So he was tickled when he saw the 3rd season's DVD on Christmas morning to add to his collection"
4,The best season of the new Batman,This is by far the best season of the New Batman. If you have been waiting to see more of the the Batman with Batman meets the Animated Series then this is the season for you!
3,"Not TAS, but watchable","I avoided The Batman for awhile, as what I had seen on television wasn't too promising.The reviews for Season 3 convinced me to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.I don't care for any of the villain changes that were made, but Ivy is interesting at least.Can't stand the way that Batman looks or sounds.However, this is worth buying for Batgirl. She brings an energy and youth to the show that is badly needed. It's a joy watching her slowly, ever so slowly, drag Batman to her side bit by bit. And you have to give her credit for being that stubborn."
1,Disc 1 worked once!,"I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter. She loves superheroes, especially Batgirl! This is the season of The Batman with the creation of Batgirl. My daughter loved these episodes on the WB's website. And when they were gone I thought buying them would be great. Got it home popped disc 1 in -waited, and waited, and waited...""error."" Tried again. Same results. Finally after 3 attempts the disc played. My daughter was thrilled! AND THEN IT NEVER PLAYED AGAIN!!!! Don't know why. We had no trouble with disc 2. Wish I could return it but she won't give it up."
2,Not Nine Wests' better products...,"These look cute in the picture, but think twice before you buy. I bought these in the brown leather in a size 10. The shoes felt more like a 9 1/2 & very tight in the toes. The metallic accent on the bottom looked like tarnished copper and the protectant was peeling off."
2,Narrow & Tight!,"Returned them due to being narrow and tight! And there was slight toe cleavage issues. Purchased a half size larger, but returned those too because it was too loose but not as narrow, toe cleavage still exist."
3,Afternoon Delights James McNair,Recipes can be found in so many books. Nothing out of the ordinary. I was a bit disappointed for a James McNair book.
4,ALWAYS NOW AND FOREVER - THIS CD WILL BE GREAT FOREVER,"AMO IS THE NEXT BONO OR BILLY JOEL, YET HE'S GOT HIS OWN STYLE. HE'S EXCELLENT; HE'S GREAT!"
2,Dried out like a clay brick and cracked on delivery.,"The compounds was probably really nice about 5 years ago.... You can still use them if you are willing to melt it down. I put a chunk of it in glass on the stove with some veg oil and make an abrasive paste out of it for use. Performance of the abrasive is very good for achieving a polished edge on knives. However, thanks to the poor overall handling on amazon's part (very stale product, not packed well at all), this is a lot more trouble than it's worth. (This was a prime order but I don't recall 100% if amazon stocked the item)."
4,Focus,"What I appreciate most about this book is the focus it provides. When I find myself in the midst of several projects all at different stages and another project arrives, I can trust the handy forms and checklists the authors provide to guide me through the needs assessment. The forms are easily customized, but as-is, they provide that nudge to get my project on paper. A big thank you to the author and editors!"
5,Pleased!,"I hoped to be able to buy this item locally to save on the postage, but the price could not be beat."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An ordinary collection of vampire stories, with three of them rated as good or better, but the average rating is only 3.25Isaac Asimov's Vampires : My Brother's Keeper - Pat CadiganIsaac Asimov's Vampires : A Surfeit of Melancholic Humours - Sharon N.

1,Worst Fitting cold air intake,I made a mistake buying this cold air intake. I had a Roush cold air intake on my 2006 F250 it took only 30 minutes to install. I recently purchased a 2007 F250 and wanted to install another intake. I had read a bunch of reviews about the Volant about how awesome it was. None of the bolt holes lined up. I had to open up holes to make the thing screw together. Ram air lid didn't line up either. So be carefull and do your research before buying the intake. Pay a little extra for a quality intake.
4,Gripping account of cultural interactions between two worlds,"This is a vivid account of the interactions between a very unusual young Englishman, Adrian Boshier, and a culture basically unchanged since it was first described over a century ago by Livingston and Selous. It is a true story of Boshier's struggle with himself and survival in a dangerous land, and of the search, seemingly directed at times by supernatural events, that lead, before his death at age thirty-nine, to discoveries that have helped both rewrite Stone Age history and give us a poetic insight into the dignity of the Stone Age mind. It is the story of an adventure of the human spirit... of a man, magic and culture of the real Africa. I cannot remember when I have so enjoyed or felt bound to the fate of an individual more than in this beautifully written story."
3,Good for an architect,"As someone, a developer, trying to come up to speed in the middle of a software project that needs to be made 'secure' this product was lacking. As someone needing to apply techniques to Java and server technologies, the coding examples that there are herein are usually in C/C++ and refer to stand alone programs. The assault techniques profiled cover such tried and true techniques like stack/buffer overflow and disassembling code under assault. Not very useful for Java and J2EE.This set never claimed it would be applicable to the Web so it is no fault of their own that it is not.What these books ARE good for is laying solid secure design practices in place in the very beginnings of the product specification process. To an architect looking for a guide to secure non web technologies I recommend this set. To a coder looking for techniques to secure code look elsewhere."
5,delish,"I got these for my mom & dad, and they loved them. They said they were smooth and creamy and very tasty! I will get them again!"
4,Very strong factual depictions,"I enjoyed this book for its factual & positive content regarding sea otters. If you are a lover of sea otter, Saving Sea Otters is probably a must. It's not fiction. It's not a compelling story per say, in terms of pure storytelling, but I found it very compelling to understand otters and the people who care for them. The photos are excellent. I'm glad I bought it but then again, I am an otter nut."
5,Nice gift,"I am an entertainer at home and love all kinds of surprises for my guests.These spreaders are useful, and add a little spice to the spreads you're serving."
5,"A great way to deepen your knowledge about NVC, straight from Rosenberg","For those of you who haven't had the chance to meet and learn directly from Marshall, these CDs are a great opportunity to learn more about the essence of NVC, directly from his founder.I personally appreciated the way Marshall teaches NVC, with anecdotes, jokes, songs (weird in the beginning, but now I understand why he uses songs... To discover in one of the CDs).I read a review mentioning that these 9 cds were the same as a shorter version... Well indeed, still NVC, still Marshall, same topic so...if you want to learn more on nvc and deepen your knowledge, this is a great tool. If you want to learn something radically new, then you may feel disappointed."
3,Pleasant,"Cologne:3 starsIt is sure to be different for everyone, but I usually need two sprays to smell it(though I have read many places online that one is enough). It lasts about 4 hours before fading, and by 6 hours it is gone. I get the same results regardless of spraying it on my neck, chest, or wrists. The smell is nice. A bottle this size if used every day will last you about 3 years.Aftershave:1 starJust not something I'll be using again. First use broke my neck out severely within minutes. I took some meds for swelling, and about two days later was normal again. There wasn't much of a smell to it. I gave it to my father, and he has had a better experience with it than me."
5,Excellent,I received the product as shown in the picture. Everything was excellent.It was new. I got it just in time.I`m very satisfied with this purchase.
1,Awful,I ordered this set as a gift. What I got was the small bottle of Joop. If I had enough time I would have sent it back. I paid for a gift set & got a single small bottle. This supplier seems to have a history of doing this. As I just read a review that said the same thing to that person. Why is this supplier still allowed to sell on Amazon?
4,Joop for men,"I live in the UK and this was a gift for my son-in-law who lives in the US. I was only asked for one of the items, but when I saw that I could have 2 in a gift box for very little extra, I chose the gift box. Being able to buy fom the security of Amazon means I can buy gifts which had they been sent from the UK customs in the US would probably not have let through!!!!"
2,Disappointed,Did not get what I ordered. I sent back the 1oz. that I received and they refunded the money. It was supposed to be a gift. Was excited for the price. But did not turn out. Just a hassle for nothing.
1,"Reclamo, cliente no conforme","No recibi el producto que compre.. Claramente hice la comprea de un Joop! Set y me enviaron un perfume Joop! De 1.0 ounce, espero repongan el producto.. Califico totalmente negativo el servicio.."
4,Good deal for the price,"This sub is easy too hook-up, good looking, and delivers a good range of sound from the low-lows to higher notes. Hard to beat for the price. And if you get it delivered by JR, you'll get it very quickly (before the estimated date in my case) and in great condition.The only downside is that it is a bit-larger and slightly heaver than I personally expected, but only slightly."
3,The print the director threw a tantrum over,"Go to the distributors web site and download the phone calls and Info and News, you will here Jim Van Bebber throw a temper tantrum over this print.The first call is the funniest, anyway the film is really good and the print is too. It is hard to see what Jims problem is."
4,Truth in Advertising,"This is a good film and well worth the 20 dollars, but the final running time of ""Satan"" is well under 20 mininutes. I can't imagine how they came up with a 60 min running time and can only see it has an attempt to lure all those bootleggers into buying a ""legal"" copy."
4,it's great and quite gore!,this film is realist !! but it's an action film with some violent and gore scenes! (quelques temps morts)!!
1,Do you need a $1000 espresso maker for only 2 years?,"This espresso maker worked great for the first two years. Since then, coffee continues to get stuck somewhere in the machine. This wouldn't be a problem if you could access the blockage. However, there is only very limited access to the inner parts and opening the machine requires special tools (not to mention a manual). Therefore, the only way to fix even the most trivial of blockages is to send the whole thing to Jura's service center in PA at a cost of >$200. To do so once or twice a year is too expensive and simply unacceptable.Bottomline: Poorly constructed and very customer unfriendly! Avoid this manufacturer!!!"
1,Mistake,After only one month of regular morning use the machine began to intermittantly malfunction. It would not complete a brewing cycle and would tell you to open the tap. This would go on for several attempts before it would finally complete a brewing cycle. Highly over rated and over priced.
1,Watch out for lemons -- broke after 2 days,"My company bought one of these to replace the similar Capressa 1000 machines which finally broke after N years.After 2 days, the LED readout of the functional information stopped working. The machine continues to operate, but you can't tell what's going on, how much water it will use for your particular cup etc.Very disappointing. We'll see how good the warranty repair is, and report back to you after we experience *that*."
1,Not a reliable machine,"We've had this for about one month, used it twice a day (two espresso drinkers in the house) and it's now starting to fail once a day. The machine will fail for a couple of attempts, ask you to open and close the tap, and evenutally work correctly. The espresso tastes great, but it's not worth the headache of using up beans on failed attempts. For this much money, you'd think they would have worked out the kinks."
2,Disappointing Purchase,"I share some bad experiences too.I bought the E8 on Amazon and used it for 3 weeks. It was working fine initially until I started using my Capresso beans, which were delivered to me just last week (made use of the Amazon rebate offer). The machine seems stuck and there is no longer a clear stream of brewed coffee. Instead, the coffee came out in droplets literally and the amount also dwindled. The machine kept requesting that its tap be turned on. I've stopped using it altogether and have emailed the Capresso customer service for assistance yesterday. There's no point calling the toll-free number since I'm never home during office hours to go through the process. This should not happen since the beans ought to be compatible in the first instance.Other than that, I must say the machine is simple to use and very convenient. Although I do agree with Roell that it does look cheap."
1,You can make bad coffee for much less money,"All the reviews at WholeLatteLove were glowing except for one which said that this unit produces weak coffee. My experience with the machine confirmed this opinion. A fully-automatic machine gives you very little control over how the coffee is made inside the machine so you're stuck with what it produces. If you like a darker, more flavorful roast, this machine demands that you set the coarsest grind which reduces the flavor and intensity of the brew. Which is what you choose a dark roast for in the first place.The machine WAS impressively convenient; a triumph of technology on the countertop. For a mediocre result."
4,"Incredible coffee, some kinks.","While nothing works impeccably, this machine is very close. The coffee and espresso it produces is top notch and I have no problems with it being hot enough, as some reviews I have read would suggest. Starbucks beans in the grinder seem to stick and I often am told to ""Fill Beans"" when it is perfectly full. Stirring the beans during grinding will fix this. I seem to use pre-ground ILLY all the time anyway. Fast warm-up, easy cleaning (once every 60 cups). Design, functionality and product are all high-class for this value. (vs 2000 Jura machines that are essentially identical)."
4,Capresso stands behind their products,"We learned about the Jura-Capresso E8 from Capresso after our previous Capresso C1000 gave up the ghost after about five years of great service. We've liked the E8 even more. In this day and age of not great customer service, Capresso shines as a rare exception. Each and every time I've needed any assistance, they've been willing and very able to help. It goes without saying that this is an expensive way to make a cup of coffee, but if you're trudging down to Starbucks twice a day for a latte you might find it's not so expensive after all. One caveat - this machine is not geared to the ""guest"" user, so don't toss your Mr. Coffee or, more likely for those reading E8 reviews, your Melior."
2,Not the original edition,"When this book arrived I discovered that it was apparently a cheap reissue of the original. The text makes numerous mentions of color plates that are lacking in the version that I received. This should have been clearly noted in the product description and it was not. In addition, the overall quality of the paper, print, and black and white images is not good-especially for a rather small book that costs over $60. Once I discovered these flaws I returned the book."
4,Don't lose Heart,Great encouragement for one who facws major trials in the near future. This book will give scripture to help you go on with life.
5,a great book to draw attention to balance needed,"Sometimes I have to buy a book for the second time before I remember to review it.Deborah Lipp has written a very thoughtful, entertaining and enlightening book about self examination and creating balance with your own natural personality and tendancies.The text is well researched and there is much to learn from and think about.Something that we have little time to do in our lives and work is think about How are we affecting ourselves? How are we affecting others in work? and DO we need some redirection to bring out the best of our characteristics and bring balance to that which is not balanced?Practical and informative and of course...MAGIC."
3,Interesting but...,"I don't like the generalisations of take this quiz (I don't like quizzes in Mags), the results mean you are Air&Water ect... While I try to live with Elemental intergrity to some extent I can not have a book of spirituality that doesn;t contain any links to God and Goddess or deeply exploring the Why of you do what you do, the infomation is good and correct, and I guess I learned alot but to me solutions like if you need more air in your life listen to this music is not what I look for. I thimk it is good sourse of infomation if you find it hard to understand the elements. For beginners or those redecorating, also it didn't discuss issues about the Elements locations ect... which is very important to us living in the Southern Hemisphere, and although I wouldn't expect to find that in a general book I would in an Elemental Book."
2,"Finally, but...","Wonderful material/subject, but wish there was more intelligence and a higher minded approach. By the way, what is this craze all of a sudden about the elements?Altea's (a whole lot better), Goddess Signs, Magickal Personalities, and The Way Of Four? Looks like some of these publishers had a few flies on the wall."
5,"Wonderful, useful book","Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. The author tells us that they are *everything* and she shows us how to take advantage of that knowledge.I love the nature exercises and meditations, which seem deep and real. I love the quizzes, which are fun and informative. There's humor (like why each element gives flowers), there's practical tips (like home decorating for the elements) and there's magic.Deborah Lipp's book The Elements of Ritual, was for Wiccans and was very structured. But The Way of Four is for everyone, really--Pagan, Wiccan, or New Age--and is very do-it-yourself.Five stars."
5,Vibrating Balls,"Chromium Steel Ball, Grade 25, Reflective Finish, Precision Tolerance, ASTM A295, InchThis review belongs in the Sex-toy section...Insert a couple of these steel balls in a condom(Regular Trojan non-lubed)with a vibrating bullit and... Well, just use your imagination..."
5,Mr Gasket 1480 Air Cleaner,"Item was received prompty, well packaged, and in excellent condition. Price was very reasonable and the shipping was economical as well. I am very pleased with this vendor and Amazon."
3,Biased grouping of essays,"Since this book has ""debating"" in the title you would think that it would provide a balance of both pro and con viewpoints on the subject of genetically modified foods. I did not find this to be the case. The majority of essays in this book are pro genetically modified foods. Also, several of the pro GMO authors have ties to companies with an economic stake in GMO foods, like Monsanto, that are not disclosed. This significantly damages these authors' credibility. I would not recommend this book if you are looking for a well-rounded exploration of this subject."
2,Ramblings of Ramtha,"Very disappointing -- I was hoping for more information not the same information presented in What the Bleep reiterated. Ramtha talks and talks and talks but there is very little instruction on ""how to create your day"". Basically it is a 45 min promotion for the School of Enlightenment."
1,Utter garbage.,I've watched What the Bleep and The Secret. Both great DVD's compared to this garbage. The other reviewers were right. Nothing new.
3,"Good message, although a little boring dvd","I was expecting it to be a little more dynamic, but it tends to get a little boring. I like very much and admire JC Knigth and Ramntha, but I think she needs to improove on the production of her dvds or hire a good film producing agency."
1,Nothing new here,"I loved What the Bleep, but this was very disappointing. There was no new information, it was basically a very boring repeat of everything that she said in What the Bleep. We know the vague concepts already, we are looking for specific information for practical application. That is what this video is advertised as providing; unfortunately, it offers none at all.It just felt like an cheap effort to make another buck on the What the Bleep hype. Watch What the Bleep, it's amazing. Pass on this one, it's a waste of time and money."
1,"Ramtha, a Very Slick Hoax","I saw the movie ""What the Bleep Do We Know"", and heard enough comments from seemingly credible people to walk away with a feeling that, ""Hey, why not?"". But after watching Ms. Knight (aka Ramtha) in her DVD ""Create Your Day"", I felt like an idiot. How could I even buy the product, let alone believe for a minute that the woman had any credibility? She's very charismatic and, to tell the truth, even hypnotic at times. But her whole DVD was full of useless babble, delivered, mind you, in a very professional manner. I guess even at my age (62), I'm still vulnerable to smooth-talkers to some extent. Scary..."
1,do not set yourself up for disappointment,"Little substance, won't work. This philosphy will only set you up for disappointment once and when you fail to create your day.it seem more like a dvd to entice you to go to ramtha's ranch. JZK is more interested in copyrights and rehashing its material, maybe have you bit $10,000 for a one hour session with ramtha. Ramtha is as expensive Eliot Spitzer's prostitutes.The disapperance of universe by gary renard is a far more interesting book, and gives a better explanation than whatever ramtha gives. Including the creation of the universe. According to ramtha some goddess, altered the semen of other gods to create the human race. the creation of the universe is explained as void contemplating itself by ramtha. A course in miracles which is what the disapperance of the universe is based provides a more believable answer."
5,life changing,"I think if you truly listen to everything this dvd has to say,and can take the time to focus and practice you can change your life forever. It makes you stop and take notice. I have recommended it to my family and friends."
1,"Too much ego. And boring, boring, boring.","I actually liked 'What the Bleep Do We Know' and found it insightful. But this Ramtha movie is a bad joke.The production value is horrible. You can hear people coughing and talking in the background.The entire 'movie' consists of a woman talking and all you see is her face the whole time. No B roll. No animation. Just a boring woman talking dribble drabble.The content is such intellectual junk that it's not useful at all. It will just create a more clouded and cluttered mind, which is the opposite end of all spiritual pursuits.The worst part is watching this woman blab on like she's a great speaker, but all that's coming out is hypothetical nonsense.Two thumbs way down."
1,New-Age Pop Philosophy,"Like ""What the Bleep Do We know"", this is just more cult new-age philosophy. Unfortunately, these guys make a fortune from these kind of videos, so expect to see an endless series of these films from this guy."
5,What A Refreshing Concept.,"That we can choose how our day will be by our focused conscious thoughts, and make life happen rather than allow it to happen to us, is beautifully freeing. When I began to do this simple little process, I realized that I was taking responsibility for myself and what I wanted to experience that day, and because I was experiencing those very things that I had created....well, that just spurred me on to do more. I now know, that the quantum field causes my thoughts and expectations to occur, all the time.The presentation of Ramtha 'up close and personal' ensures that we get his message loud and clear, as he addresses the subjects of doubt and hope, assuring us of the divinity within each and every one of us, and that life is a gift.'What The Bleep Do We Know' is a must see along with 'Create Your Day', as it also takes you down the rabbit hole of endless exciting possibilities.Thank You Ramtha.Belinda Dawson"
1,watered down unanswered questions,"I unfortunately bought 4 of the ramtha dvds at the same time.. this was the best of them.. the others were pure wastes of money. While this one didnt answer many questions and ramtha takes forever to make a point. if you've seen ""what the bleep"" dont waste your time or money on these ramtha dvds.."
4,soundtrack for the millenium,"This CD has a bunch of great songs on it from some very interesting emerging artists. Though more styles could have been represented, the collection contains a wide range of styles, giving it a global feel. It's the soundtrack for humanity's assault on the walls of y2k."
4,No Problem,I'm sure it works fine. I haven't used it yet. I had to change the location of my cable modem due to unseen reason behind the walls.
5,Works as expected,The connector works great-came quickly and was a good price too. I used it to connect a long coax from the wall to my tv
5,It works,"Arrived in an envelope via USPS. A metal clad part this small won't be damaged by this mode of delivery.I'm pretty sure it was on time; my USPS box usually has cobwebs in it by the time I remember to check it.The adapter is good quality and allows me to place my highly sophisticated rabbit ears on a table, instead of trying to balance them on the top edge of the flat screen TV. See, there WAS a reason to have great big thick TVs..."
5,Help When Needed,The cable from my house to my small office building behind the house was just a bit too short. This connector is just what the doctor ordered. It is easy to attach to the cables and extends a TV signal with no degradation. This is a $2.55 item well worth the cost.
5,Works great,This product works well. The cables connected to it with out any issues and I would recommend it to any one
5,To Buy It 3 Times ...It Must Be Good ! ! !,"Well I have owned the vinyl since the album came out in the mid 70's, complete with the unused iron on T-shirt transfer. Then as I have tried to collect CD's I bought a copy in CD. Now ,as the years have lost that copy, I just replaced it. As always, it is Chicago at their best, with all the trimmings. You can see by my other reviews, I am a Chicago fan. What else can I say, this is a very good album. I can't say enough about it, the song selection includes some real ""classic"" Chicago hits like ""Old Days"" and some off the wall non-mainstream""sleepers"". That you will love. This version of the CD is remastered to include a couple of extra rehersal tracks."
3,Not their best,"This was a dissapointment. No long instrumental tracks or great arrangements like VII. There are some good moments when compared to albums after X but they were definitely headed in a different direction. The best part of the original album was the COOL ""iron0on"" that was included with the album. Too bad they can't re-issue that. I always wanted one on a levi jacket."
2,The Formula Has Spoiled..............,"Other than ""Old Days"" and possibly ""Harry Truman"" this is crap and the transition album that would never again see Chicago write songs as good as ""Beginnings""......call this one ""Endings"" and forget everything that followed.....because the aftermath wasn't pretty."
1,The beginning of the end,"This is probably the groups worst recording and I've heard them all.I don't know what happened after VII(which was very good) but something invariably went wrong with the band's compositional skills(i.e.drug problems,etc.).The first 3 are still the best of the original group.Songs like Harry Truman,Old Days,O thank you great spirit were embarrassing to listen to."
3,Too easy- a dissapointing second to Tae Bo,"I was dissapointed!! I found that it was as it was ""beginning to intermediate"" I am use to the advanced tae Bo which far exceeds the workout here."
1,I really didn't enjoy this video...,"This workout video got a lot of rave reviews from individuals who purchased it, but I'm sorry to say that I'm far from pleased with this workout. I have four other videos from Kathy Smith so I decided to try this one to add variety to my workouts. What I found was a fairly difficult routine to follow and moves that were too fast for me to follow correctly. I got very demotivated very fast after a few minutes into this workout. Unfortunately, I have to say that this tape was a waste of my money."
2,TAEBO IS BETTER,"I originally bought this tape instead of ""TaeBo"", because it cost less and I thought it would be a more complete workout. I am not at all impressed with Kathy Smith's teaching style. I think this workout tape is meant for people who are experienced with traditional aerobics videos and really enjoy them. Kathy Smith is not very motivating or enthusiastic, in fact I thought she was annoying. If you really are interested in doing a ""Taebo"" sort of workout, I recommend buying the real thing (Billy Blank's TaeBo). It is worth the money and will change your life!"
2,NOT for Kickboxing Newbies!,"I bought this video because of the great reviews it got here on Amazon. I sat down to preview the tape before even starting it, and I ended up shutting it off. Smith does not give you intense training on the moves - though Billy Blanks does in his instructional video. I don't think I could have done half of the things she even did in her warmup, because she didn't tell us what position we should be in, or even how to go about learning the moves. If I couldn't even follow her during the warmup, imagine how the rest of the video fared! This may be good for someone with kickboxing experience, but for the kickboxing newbie this is not the video for you."
4,Goes by very quick!,"This video is fun, short and easy to learn. If there is any down side to it, its only the exceedingly long introduction and the choice of workout partners. Kelli Roberts is VERY annoying (the person to Kathy's right in the video). She (Kelli) seems to want to be the star of the video. Otherwise, a thoroughly enjoyable video."
4,A great second runner up to Aerobox,"I was very excited to buy this video after using Kathy's Aerobox video for about 6-7 years now, but as much as I enjoyed it I still have to say that I like the Aerobox more. However, this video is fun and challenging and I would still recommend it to anyone interested in aerobic kickboxing. The cast is energized without being sugary -- no yips and cheers from this crowd -- and as usual Kathy Smith is an exceptional instructor. Keith Cooke is pleasant too, but I found the rapport between Kathy and Michael Olajide Jr. friendlier in Aerobox.One nice surprise was seeing Kelli Roberts working out along with the gang. A MUCH better buy than those overhyped Tae Bo videos!"
2,Just not fun,"I love tae bo, and thought I'd give Kathy's version a try. I thought it might be more challenging, or just add some variety to my workouts. I did the DVD twice and yes, it got my heart rate up and all, but it was just dull! The ""advanced workout"" was a joke - the same workout, but with ""challenge"" moves at the end, after my heart rate had gone down! My advice: try TaeBo II instead. The basic tapes are easy but the advanced ones are tough, and a lot more FUN to do than this workout!"
4,Great workout,"Kathy Smith does not pretend to be a kickboxing expert. She is an icon of the fitness industry and with that in mind, this is an excellent video. There have been complaints about her form and that it's too much jumping around, but this is supposed to be an aerobic take on kickboxing, not a how-to. I always get quite a workout from this video and I have been doing tapes for 8 years and am in good condition. You may not be able to do the video flawlessly at first (it doesn't help that some cues are late and some misguided), but being able to DO a tape SHOULD be a challenge. It's a waste of money if you can do it the first time. This tape is upbeat and fun (I do wish she had used Keith Cook more and worn shorts so we could see what she was doing more easily!) This is a staple in video workouts."
5,Great Workout!,"This is one of the first exercise DVDs I ever purchased (I bought it about 3 years ago) and I really enjoy it still. The workout is a good length and the moves are easy to master. I like all of the bonus features, like being able to add on the advanced combos and the Tai chi session. I also feel like this video gives you a good amount of warm-up and cool-down time with plenty of stretches to avoid injury.One of the things I really like about the cool-down/leg exercises near the end of the workout is that she does all 4 kicks slowly using a chair for balance. This provides a good cool down while showing you proper form and conditioning your leg muscles so that you will have better kicking form next time you do the workout.On a side note, Kathy instructs so that you can mirror her (i.e. she punches with her left and tells you to punch with your right) which I have an easier time following than the other way around."
3,"Not for klutzes, and make sure you have lots of space","This video was very frustrating... although they paid careful attention to form (which is touted as good by the experts) I couldn't keep up. There were too many changes and I was always 2 or 3 moves behind. Also, I didn't have enough room to do the moves without hitting the wall. I'd say give yourself about 5 feet on all sides. I tried this workout once and it's been collecting dust ever since."
2,Not enough instruction and boring,"As a user of the Billy Blanks Tae Bo tapes, I got this looking for another fun tape to do. But I didn't feel she gave enough intruction about the punches and kicks. If I had not had martial arts training it would have been easy to hurt myself. Also, I didn't think the workout was very interesting, it felt like an aerobics class. This is one tape that's stayed on my shelf not in the VCR."
2,Disappointed in Indiana,"After reading the wonderful reviews, I bought this video. Kickboxing is not for me. I would much rather do step or a dance exercise video. All that punching is not for me. I wasted my money."
2,not worth the money,"One of those girlie DVDs. I don't understand why Kathie Smith didn't leave all the kickboxing to the guy, Jeff Cooke. This guy has the power, speed and aggressiveness that I want to see in a kickboxing DVD.Otherwise I'd buy one of the countless aerobic DVDs.The movements of the girls look like dancing.The TaiChi ""thing"" is ridiculous and has absolutely nothing to do with TaiChi.Next time, move Kathie and her girls to the back row and let Jeff do the kickboxing and there you have it, a good workout DVD."
2,Just a So-So Kickboxing video,"I typically like Kathy Smith and her videos. I've been kickboxing for a while and feel this isn't close to the slowest kickboxing class I get at my gym. However, I felt I had to comment on others in the video. There's a male martial arts guy named Keith Cooke. There is also another female (?) in the video and she scares me to death! I'm so frightened of her that I won't do this video anymore. I wouldn't want to meet her in a lighted alley!"
1,Kathy Smith annoyed the heck out of me!,"If you're a Kathy Smith fan, then you can ignore this review. If you don't know who she is, consider yourself warned. After doing the Billy Blanks Tae-Bo thing, I liked it but wanted to try something new. I found Kathy Smith so annoying I had to turn off the video. And what's the deal with her hair-do anyway?"
4,Worth the price,"The moves are similar to those found in the Tae Bo routines. However, the intensity of the workout is significantly less than the Tae Bo workouts. This workout is great for the begginer or as a primer for Tae Bo. Kathy does a nice job with the instructions but performs akwardly compared to the other instructors. The music is decent and they are always in sync. I use the video as an alternate to Tae Bo either as a change of scenery or on days when the energy level is low."
4,"Great DVD options, challenging workout","The workout is definitely challenging, and you WILL feel it later in the day (arms, back, glutes)! It takes a few times to get the combinations together without looking spastic, and I could only get through about 35 minutes of the routine at first. The options on the DVD are great...you can ""customize"" your workout by chosing which parts of the workout you want to do (it will stop between ""chapters"" but would still be worth it if you wanted to focus on something or had less time to work out). You also have the option to just hear the music and watch the DVD which is great once you understand the moves. I'm in pretty good shape, and this has been a great addition to my workouts."
3,Not up to her usual standard,"I found this workout annoying, her instructions irritating, (after taking Karate for two years you would never punch someone in the knee) and the whole tape vastly inferior to Tae-bo. Very disappointed as I usually like Kathy Smith videos."
5,First time kickboxer,I bought this DVD to add an aerobic (sp?) component to my daily workout. I have only been doing for two week and I have already notice the difference in my waist line.
4,Its Great!,"It a great work out tape, but Kathy pushes you and its easy to get out of breath. Its hard to keep up, but even as uncordinated as I am I like it. I wouldn't reccomend it to anybody w/ babies due to the amount it takes."
3,Fair workout,"I bought this DVD because of the great reviews it got. I found it dissapointingly easy, and just when you start getting into the sequence it was over. The workout is great for beginners. For a really great workout nothing compares to Marcel Daane's KICKFIT The Ultimate Workout, now that's a workout that makes you sweat bullets and pummel every muscle in your body! I wish it was available on Amazon."
3,Frustrating...,"This video was incredibly frustrating. The woman on Kathy's right contradicted everything Kathy said. She would shoot out punches quickly and snappily, which Kathy said not to do to start out with. Her pants were shint and distracting, too. Also, the woman behind Kathy punched incorrectly, according to Keith and Kathy: her elbows came out to the side. They went a little too fast: I had to rewind certain parts four or five times till I as able to understand. A beginner tape needs to be simpler, and the other people working out need to not contradict what Kathy says."
4,break a sweat but that's it,"this is a good video to have, you do break a sweat but that's really it.i've had this video for 6 months, using it probably every other week, and i'm already in the market for a new one. the routines are pretty easy to follow and remember for next time.don't get me wrong, you DO break a sweat (i'm in good shape: gym with weight training 3 - 5 times a week). Kathy really does get you moving in the warm up and keeps you moving for the whole time.it's not very challenging for those who want the extra push or who want more of a variation.i will continue to use it, but not as often as i have."
5,"A very motivating, fun workout!","Let me start off by saying that I tried the Tae-Bo videos by Billy Blanks, and they are NOTHING compared to this workout. The Tae-Bo tapes didn't explain how to do any of the kicks or punches correctly, much less the correct stance. Kathy Smith's tape teaches the do's and don'ts of each punch and kick, and teaches the correct stance. She gives you plenty of notice before switching moves, which, I might add, the Tae-Bo tapes DO NOT do. I am an intermediate exerciser, and every single time I do this workout, (which I've done for the past 2 months) I'm drenched in sweat. Despite that, I feel good and energized,and not at all tired. Best of all, I don't get bored with this program. I'm looking forward to working out every day, which I couldn't say while I was doing the Tae-Bo, Reebok, or Buns of Steel tapes. This tape is very much worth the $."
4,Excellent workout for Beginner -Intermediate !!!,"I have been working out with Billy Blanks videos for almost 4 months and was beginning to find the Basic version too slow but was not getting a safe and maximum workout from the Advanced. I was looking for a faster and well-coordinated routine and found it with Kathy Smith's video...Her program is very well coordinated from warm up to work out and the transitions to new punch/kick combinations are easy to follow and safe. I actually learned how to move better and safer with this video, even though I have been doing Tae-Bo for 4 months. Dance music is very upbeat and motivational ...my heart rate stayed up throughout the entire workout. I was disappointed in the last section where she engages the help of Kelli and Keith to lead some great but complicated combinations. These are great fat burning moves but don't get enough sets. By the time you master the combination, it's over. Still, highly recommended for beginner to intermediate levels."
4,Kickboxing is not for me,"I don't enjoy kickboxing...however, this is a good cardiovascular workout and I am certain it burns many calories..."
2,Poor quality,"I'd have to say that on a technological level, this video is reminiscent of something from 10 years ago. It is of extremely poor quality and the camera angles are terrible especially in comparison to another of Kathy's Videos, Aerobox(1994), which was superior. As a competitive athlete I may be judging the workout portion too harshly, but I found it to be a Tae Bo copy (not to say that was much better) using moves that would hardly be challenging for a beginner, which is the only way to form strength. I wish beginners who have used the video once would stop rushing to their computers telling the public that it has changed their lives. I plan to return this video and would discourage anyone from purchasing it. However, one thing which I do not understand is the purpose of Keith Cooke. He seems capable, but he had no real instructional part in the video, probably just another advertising icon."
2,Don't waste your $$,The video is nothing compared to what the reviews that are posted. I was looking for a workout comparable to the kickboxing classes that I take at my local martial arts school. There has to be a better video than this one.
2,Boring....,"Well, I'm not saying it's a ""BAD"" workout...I just felt it was a little slow...okay, VERY slow. I didn't break a sweat and could barely finish it. I felt that I was standing around most of the time waiting to get started. I personally like Billy Blank's Tae Bo's MUCH more and find they are much better workouts."
1,Simply Aweful!!!,"Why does Kathy Smith have a following? Why does she have to make those sounds and sound so insincerely chatty? Ugh! If you hate exercise videos where the fitness leader ""acts"" as if the workout is sooooo fun, even orgasmic, then skip this one."
3,"EASY TO DO, NOT MUCH VARIETY THOUGH","Alright for beginners, but not challenging enough for anyone pass the beginner stage. Kathy spends time showing the basic moves of kickboxing, but this takes up too much of the dvd's time. Would like to see more moves."
3,Good Fat Burner,"This video is a great way to burn calories because it keeps you moving the entire time. I only gave it three stars because I thought it would be more of a kickboxing instructional video (teaching you neat kicks and punches), but it's not. It's just an aerobic-type workout tape. But if you want to drop pounds and you don't mind sweating, than this is the video for you."
2,OK workout- Few combination moves,"I have been kickboxing for some time and I was a bit disappointed to find this tape to be more of an instructional tape for those just beginning to kickbox, than a good workout for someone with experince. The warm-up section (10 min) is good and is followed by a cardio section (25 min) that focuses on teaching punches and kicks. After the main workout there is a short section which focuses on the leg and butt and is very helpful for improving kicking form. The stretching section and the abs section aren't worth it. I usually end up doing my own stretching and abs. The real disappointment for me in this video is the lack of combination moves. The ones that Kathy does do aren't that difficult and are very short. Kathy is also a little irritating after the third or fourth time of doing the tape. I am looking forward to trying XKO and other kickboxing workout tapes."
2,kathy smith's kickboxing workout,"I hate to disagree with all the positive reviews (which is why I bought the tape), but this is not a tape for beginners. Actually, I've been doing kick boxing exercises for about six months when I got this tape. I still found it too complicated to get into easily. The moves change quickly from one to another, so I was always behind and off balance. I suppose that would improve with time. Don't get this unless you are pretty well coordinated. In all fairness, I am older and not terribly well coordinated."
4,Great cardio workout!,"I thoroughly enjoy this video! It is easy to follow and gives a very good workout. One of the things I really like about this video is the length of each routine. Kathy gives you enough time to learn the moves, then practice the move, which lessens the risk of injuring yourself. Beginners might find this video hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun! And it's great cardio exercise! This video is definitely heads above the Tae-Bo series which goes at a very fast pace and doesn't allow you time to learn what you are doing. Kathy Smith always does a great job researching whatever exercise genre she is working in and her choreography is very good. I would recommend it to anyone who likes cardio kickboxing and wants a good workout."
3,Kathy Smith Kick Box,"In general this is a good workout - but Kathy confuses the viewer with comments that are not in sync with the movements - saying the wrong thing at the wrong time - some simple audio editing would have been a good idea. Or add the audio after the video was completed. There is some confusion when she turns to the other instructors as to who is in charge - who speaks, who leads - The exercises after the kick box workout are brutally difficult! And if she ever says ""You Got It"" again I might bite somebody's leg!!!"
2,Not into it,Can't say I'm that excited by this tape. I've done quite a few Kathy Smith tapes and have seen great results with all of them...except for this. I don't feel that I build up enough of a sweat and the moves irritated me. I don't find there is enough kicking or high impact cardio.
4,Kickin' Good Time,"Although I have both Taebo Sets (the first basic and the new Live Series), I found this work-out to be fun, safe and very effective. Kathy Smith's queing is impeccable and the Keith's split screen queing enabled me to focus consistently on my technique during the work-out itself, something the Taebo tapes lacks. While I miss the ""Live"" feeling the Taebo delivers, this has great music and is just as fun. (I sometimes play the soundtrack to the matrix when I am doing Taebo) The only drawback is it is only 45 minutes long. Great Job, Kathy!"
4,DVD is a great format for workouts,"I have taken kickboxing classes at my local YMCA, but this DVD is a lot better. I like the multiple camera angles and the fact that you can slow down the speed of play so you can watch the moves in slow motion. As a beginner, I also appreciated Kathy Smith's teaching technique. I also like having the option to customize my workout."
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this workout tape to get back in shape after my baby. Although I did work up a sweat, I thought some of the moves were complicated and had the potential to injure my knees. I think someone who has some previous kick-boxing experience or is really fit and agile would enjoy this."
2,"Contains useful nuggets, but unsatisfying overall","If you're looking for one book to introduce you to GUI design and give you a solid grounding in design for usability, this isn't it. It gives many useful tips and truisms, however, and if you buy it as one element of your larger usability/UI design library, you will be well served. In my work, I'm sometimes called upon to provide usability inspections and design critiques. This book has provided good support for some of the improvements I've asked programmers and designers to make."
1,Not Very Helpful to an Owner or Handicapper,"As a handicapper who is considering buying a thoroughbred race horse, I had high hopes when purchasing this book. I have read many handicapping books; this one is the most poorly written book by far. I can't believe a professional editor, if one was used, would have ignored the spelling, grammatical and typographical errors as well as the incomplete and awkward sentences. It made it difficult to read. The material was also very weak with very limited detail on any subject. Skinny to begin with, the author repeats many of his points using almost the same words with little additional insight. Hard to assess the value of the subject information. I can't say that it's not right and it gives the reader some different things to consider when handicapping or claiming. Despite all its weaknesses, I rated it one star because it got me motivated to quickly learn as much as possible about acquiring a horse, before I jumped in."
1,Only for novices,"This book would only be useful to those who have never owned, or spent much time around racing or race horses. The information is basic, and not very well presented at that. If you know the difference between a claiming race and an allowance race, don't bother getting this book."
1,BEGINNER NOT PRO,"THIS BOOK IS STRICTLY FOR THE BEGINNER I WOULD SAY, AND HAS LITTLE TO NO HANDICAPPING INFORMATION"
5,Pure and simple,"I've only trained with Guy a few dozen times over the last few years and from the first practice with him I could start to see lights come on in my practice, and life. Guy studies practical aplication of what we've been practicing for years from prespectives that I'd never seen before. You would do well to read, practice, and understand."
5,Go ahead and buy it,I gave it fives stars for arriving on time and just as described on the web site. The rest is up to your taste.
1,Programming shows to record is difficult,"It would be difficult to make a Timer Program Recording screen that is any worse. I did eventually manage to get my shows programmed, but for some reason they randomly choose to not record.Move on to another VCR - this Toshiba isn't worth the frustration."
1,This is most horrible useless thing I have ever bought,"Biggest problem on this VCR is when you play video, make squeaky noisy sound you cannot stand.In addition, it is hard to program and edit recording programs and you cannot record with longer tape mode. The quality and noise get worse.I just want my money back and forget about my mistake, which I bought this product."
2,They do the job...,"The reason for 2 stars is only because I found these at the local wal-mart, 19.99 for 40! Co2 is Co2 why not get the better deal."
1,DO NOT BUY,"TERRIBLE PACKAGING HALF OF THEM WERE PUNCTURED BECAUSE THEY CAME IN A ZIPLOCK BAG. AND THEY DIDNT FIT MY GUN, EVEN THOUGH EVERY OTHER BRAND DOES. AND WORST OF ALL, THEY DIDNT CONTACT ME BACK. IF I COULD RATE 0 STARS I WOULD. DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY,"
5,pigeon repellant,i don't know anything about bb guns...and...i anguished over the thought of killing pigeons which poop all over the place... so...i use the bb gun to scare pigeons away... the bb gun isn't powerful enough to kill them...just scares the hell out of 'em and they don't return... problem solved without being a pigeon murderer...
2,Recived...,"When opening the package, all of the cartridges were laying all over the box and the Crosman package box was broken. The package was poorly packaged with very little packing paper. the only thing good was that i got it on time."
3,Shipping issues,"The product itself does exactly what it is intended to do. The reason I gave this product three stars was based upon delivery. It came via UPS and arrived quickly, sounds great right? Yeah, just perfect until I opened the 'Amazon' labeled box. Once I opened the brown 'Amazon' box I discovered the entire Crosman 12 Gram CO2 cartridges were loose within the box. The original (blue and red) box the cartridges came in was laid flat, as if it wasn't glue correctly or assembled at all. Therefore, I would buy this product again, but the manufacture needs to be fully aware of the packaging and shipping problem."
3,CO2 Cartridges,"The product was just fine. Knew what we were ordering. The shipping, however, was less than expected. It took much longer to get the cartridges than the rifle we ordered."
4,great product,The product was great for my new 357. magnum pellet gun and it werks as great as you think but..... The shipping was careless I got this in a box and so i opened it then 25 co2 catridges were everywere there were only two pieces of paper. I had to put the cartridges in the box again. But otherwise I would buy it again hope the review was helpful. Thankz. :]
4,CO2 cartrages,"worked great in my gun, and lasted around 50 (maybe more, I lost track) shots or so in my pellet gun."
1,Bribery?,Received a brand of CO2 cartridges that was not the ordered CROSMAN brand. Was contacted by seller DORO Sports and offered a refund of shipping feefor a good review!!!
5,Good Deal,"These CO2 cartridges work great in my C02 pistol. I don't know exactly how many shots I get out of each cartridge, but it is a lot and I don't notice any major loss of power after shooting a few clips. I really can't compare these to other brands as I have only used the Crosman cartridges, but the Crosman cartridges work well and are priced right so I feel no need to try any others."
3,Cheap box,The cartridges are good...but the box they come will fall apart when you pick it up. I taped it up.
2,Horrible packaging,"when i got the package the box was almost totally crushed and when i opened it almost half the cartridges were punctured and unusable, of the few that worked i guess it was a good product. never ordering again though due to crappy handling and horrible packaging"
2,Not up to Gerber standards,"I have multitools from various manufacturers and this tool is the biggest disappointment. The Fiskars scissors are excellent, but the other implements lack a good finish. The screwdrivers do not slide out well (or at all). They have used plastic pieces in the locking mechanism. How will this stand out over time? My experience says ""not very well"". This is a darn shame because the scissors are so good that they could probably suffice as a wire cutter in a pinch.If you want a good multitool that is about this size, try a Victorinox ""Minichamp"" (tried and true), or Leatherman ""Micra"" (great waranty). Both of these tools are of uncompromised quality. Both Victorinox and Wenger have a variety of small multitool knives to choose from. BTW, Wegner knives are also of very high quality."
3,Contains Important Information,"I had purchased ""Start with the Soil"" by the same author and loved it. I thought this book would be a more advanced version but this is not the case. It was actually written before and reworked in a different format to become ""Start with the Soil"". This is the reason I gave it a lower rating. Although there are some differences, I would say if you are interested in a home size garden or landscape, this book is really not the better choice even thought the other is no longer in print. That said, the information contained is invaluable and something anyone who loves working the soil should really understand--which ever version you end up purchasing."
3,ok,Little difficult to read as chapters aren't organized as well as I would like to see them. Seems a little jumbled.
4,A Brochure for Guatemala,"Asturias writes like no one I have ever read before, but what irked me was the constant dependency on the back of the book for keys as to what anything meant. Much of it comes from the legends of the Mayan culture which I'm sure most people don't know concisely enough to know parts of the Mayan ""bible."" For the more patient reader, it is an amazing set of tales, but without the critical edition, I think one might become devoured by the profundity it entails, and comprehend only the title. From what I read however, I realized that we are dealing with an unorthodox writer, a shaman with words, and the predecessor of Marquez."
3,"This cd should be titled the ""Best Of Scott Hamilton""","What a thrill it was for me to buy this cd. It has 12 tracks on it from 12 different cd projects. It re-opened my eyes to what Scott had available of his music. I am sure I will want to order more products by him based on this cd.On this cd Scott plays nothing but pure ballads. This is my favorite kind of song. I can't seem to get enough of this romantic music. For the most part I liked what Scott did with this project. However, I did hear a few songs that I didn't paticulary like. All in all, I liked this cd and hope others will feel like wise."
1,This game is lame,"The old saying ""dont judge a book by it's cover"" totally struck home when I slapped ""Shadow man into my playstation. I fell for the cover of the game. What game wouldnt be cool with a guy holding a skull on the cover right? Wrong. The game started off kind of cool,(interesting story line) then the story ended and the game began. I felt I wasted my $$$ just to give this game a try. This game is not worth your time. Dont rent it or buy it. I hear the N64 version is better but I dont have a N64 console. Oh well."
1,Shadow Man,i was so excited about playing this game after seeing the cover and reading the storyline...but it totally let me down...
1,Major Disapointment,"When I started this game I was excited about playing because the storyline seemed good. But when I actually started playing, I found it boring and difficult beyond fun. Collecting the dark souls was a very difficult task. Shooting the deadside freeks was the only plus and even that went very slowly. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME."
1,Playstation Version Severely Disappointing,"I bought this game on the faith that it just might be of the graphic caliber of SoulReaver. Imagine my dismay when I actually saw it. My first instinct was to snap the disc in half, my second to return it. The graphics are boxy, flat and pixilated, the movements hardly refined and the transitions horrid. I would suggest you buy SoulReaver instead. Now that is a prime example of what can be done for the Playstation. Whatever you do, do NOT get this game for PSX."
4,Shadowman for Playstation,I had played this game before on the Nintendo 64. I am currently going back and getting some of my old school favorites. This is one of those games.Thank you to the seller who sent this to me quick.
5,A real Game for Adults....,"I love this game, the plot is cool, the levels get harder, and there are still games out there that make you think. I have a strategy guide and the game is still hard at times.....Great, what gaming is all about"
3,Entertaining but could be much better,"This game was a bit of a disappointment. The Shadowman comic book series was a well-done piece of work, but this game smacks of a cheap imitation of Soul Reaver. The cutscenes are interesting and the game concept is good, but the gameplay and graphics are choppy."
2,Nothing special,"I didn't notice my skin getting any better while taking this product and I didn't notice it getting any worse. The dose is pretty high so you will go through these pills pretty quickly and it will get expensive, not good for something you don't think is making a difference."
4,Script + Photos + Interview,"What you get is the shooting script for this gonzo film plus a sixteen page color photo insert of stills from the movie. At the end is an eight page interview with the reclusive Charlie Kaufman about the writing of the film in which he uses the word ""... ..."" quite a bit. By the way, if you're interested in the script, there's a quite good interview with Kaufman about the film in the March/April 2002 issue of Creative Screenwriting magazine. The Nov/Dec. 2002 issue also has an interview with him, that one's about ""Adaptation"" and ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."""
1,keep your change.,i had seen this for $2 at a book store & got it. i mainly wanted to hear the tracks w/ papa reu & lifestyl. turns out those are the only tracks on the entire album worth jamming. save your time & money unless you really are a fan of papa reu & lifestyl.
3,"Subject matter is fascinating, but stye is terrible.","The Entebbe rescue is such an incredible subject, that it's almost impossible to write a bad book about it. However, the author of this book succeeded in doing just that. Despite the fact that it is a pain to read because of the style, the book is still worth reading because the incident itself is so incredible."
3,Mine was in Spanish!,"I had no idea the cookbook was going to be in Spanish and that was rather a surprise! Maybe it said somewhere on the page, but I'll be darned if I could find it.So, I haven't made any recipes yet, but it did cause me to decide to brush up on my long forgotten Spanish. Good way to learn, I guess!"
4,My problems with CPU speed,"I love to play games. Just a while ago, I received a really nice game from Microsoft, Mechwarrior 4, And it had just come out. I was truly excited, but when I installed it and started playing, I discovered that my 466 couldn't handle the impressive graphics of the game. I turned the detail down, and that worked well, but I was missing out on the awesome graphics of the game. Anyway, I went out and got this CPU upgrade, and I was copletely satisfied with the results I got. I would suggest this upgrade to anyone who needs, a faster computer."
5,awsome game,This game is a blast although I do not own I have rented it but am looking to buy very very soon the graphics are to cool not to easy yet not to hard chalenging always trying to beat your biggest catch . The tournements are very all in all it is one of the better games I have played and you would like it to
4,Thanks to this game I am now a world class bass fisherman!,"(This text refers to the PC version of this game)Okay... you got me.... I exagerated about being a world class bass fisherman, but isn't that what it's all about anyway? Great pc game. Fun, challenging, addictive, and strangly educational for the bass ignorant (like me). The bigger they are the harder they are to land. Good graphics too. Better than the playstation version for a couple of reasons: 1) There are many more lakes to choose from and they are modeled after actual lakes in the U.S. 2) The behavior of the fish seems to be more realistic (possibly due to more memory?).You'll enjoy it."
3,Fun family Bass Fishing,"The game was extremly fun, but I found it to take time to get used to. All in all I give it three stars, as the graphics could use some upgrading."
1,Poor Quality,I am returning this item. The end caps of the actual towel bars are cheap plastic. All but one of these end caps are broken fresh out of the box.
4,Useful for multi-towel storage,"Just as described - over the door towel rack great for hanging multiple towels. It was easy to put together and then just goes over the door, easy!"
1,over shower door towel rack,"ad misrepresented product. Might be good for a room door, but not for a shower door."
3,"a good machine, but unrepairable if it breaks","had this machine for quite a few years with no problem. Original cost over $400 so it was quite pricey. Eventually the on/off switch broke. I contacted Breville and they would not sell me the part. They referred me to replacementparts.com and I ordered the part from them. When it arrived, I attempted to install the new switch, a $10 item. I found that the Breville company uses screws with some design on them that no screw or nutdriver in my extensive collection would fit. It look like a phillips but it's not. So I threw the whole thing away. Evidently the machine is ENGINEERED TO BE UNREPAIRABLE SO YOU HAVE TO BUY A NEW ONE. I am buying a new one, but obviously NOT a Breville."
2,Great machine but on/off button died,"This is a solid machine. The design is great and most importantly, so is the coffee. It's pretty easy to use. My only complaint is that after 2.5 years, the on/off buttons are failing. Of course it's out of warranty and the only service shop is 40 min drive away (I live in NYC). It's a bit of a bummer as you would think that this should have held up for many, many more years.For this one mechanical reason, I am having a very hard time recommending this. Too bad as the espresso and cappuccinos it makes are great."
1,It was great til it died,"Bought a Breville espresso machine a bit over 4 years ago.I've worked as a barista and owned a professional machine.Missed it a bunch, chose this for home use.Worked great for 4 years, using only occasionally.Then, it died.My grandson says no one expects a coffee maker to last this long.Maybe 100 drinks? No more than 200.All good machines I've ever used, no matter what their use, lasted better than this.What do I buy now? Breville is out.Linda"
2,It's going back today,"I hate to take this machine back because it looks so nice, is easy to use, and made decent espresso, WHEN it worked. Unfortunately, as another reviewer noted, coffee only drips out of one side or the other of the double spout filter holder. This makes for unpredictable quality/brew times, and a huge hassle if you want to make multiple shots. I've tried it with pods, single and double filter. And no matter what type of bean or grind, it would drip instead of pour out in a stream like it should.I tried everything to save this machine because I loved the look, functionality, and the compact size. No luck. I called Breville about the one-or-the-other filter. No help. Even they suggested that I return it. Why I didn't get an Italian-designed machine is beyond me. I am going to exchange this for one and hope it does a better job."
2,Average Brew,"I have used a Starbucks barista for over 10 years so I sort of know how to make espresso, but wanted to upgrade recently. Like many here I too found this unit marked down so I purchased it. To make a long story short, no matter what type of espresso, how I grind it, or how hard it is pressed down in the basket, I get the same result. A quick black brew and then it immediately turns clear and watery, and yes this is a shot glass amount, no over watering. I am very disappointed and plan to return the unit."
1,Firefly Buys attempt at ripoff,"Just received my machine. Dirty...complete with coffee stains on the machine and a cup ring stain on the top of the machine. To add insult to injury, the water tank was not included in the package. So, I was shipped a package containing a used machine that lacked all of the contents. USELESS. I don't know.....hmmmm, maybe I missed a mention of them selling used equipment. Overall, a complete waste of time...can't use the machine and it's a pain to have to deal with them on this issue and repackage/ship the machine. Love amazon.com and have had many successful purchases but Firefly Buys blows....at least for me. Amazon, find a more reputable dealer!!!!"
3,not the colors you may receive,"The markers worked fine, but you may not receive the colors that are in the picture. I received teal, light green, yellow, and pink; I would not have purchased that set if I had seen them in a store."
3,you can print on both sides,"The paper was disappointingly thin. The box does indicate that it is 51 pound paper. If you need paper of particular thickness do not guess, determine the weight you require for what ever your purpose is and buy accordingly. The image quality is Fabulous this is a great product and would have been perfect for my project if the paper were thicker. Kodak makes an Ultra Premium Paper that is 74 lb but you cannot print on both sides. I gave it three stars only because the paper was to thin."
4,"Good, but not as cutting edge as it tried to be","These cartoons try very hard to be cutting edge, bizarre, wierd, ....twisted in a word.They are enjoyable, better than most recent cartoons, but not quite up to the initial potential of the series. Not quite up to the surrealism of some early Felix cartoons, for that matter."
5,My favorite PSone game ever,"This game is very ominous and scary. I love the capabilities the characters have, and the scenery is spooky. It was one of the last PSone games, so the graphics are advanced for that platform. You can definately see the improvements between Resident Evil and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. I love playing this on my PS2, and I'm not even getting the gamecube version of it because it's exactly the same as this version."
3,"Fun for a while, but then...","I enjoyed this game for a few days before it simply became too tedious. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands and can endure the frustration of running around in circles looking for an object or clue that will help you solve some puzzle you're up against, avoid. For me, it got old real quick. I would have enjoyed this game a lot more if they'd doubled the action and cut the puzzle crap in half."
5,One of the best games on PSX!,"This game kept me on the edge of my seat for days. I highly recommend. Gameplay is awesome, graphics are perfect and the bonus game at the end of the main game is worth playing through the whole thing more than once."
5,fun game,"this game is very fun, plays quickly and offer a lot new features, wish it was longer though but the game is a little more difficult than the previous resident evils but still fun."
5,almost as good as resident evil 2,first let me get something off here. resident evil 2 was the best but that doesnt mean to not get this one too because this is an incredible game very fun lasts long enough to keep you entertained from begining to end . and then when you beat it you will unlock the mercenarieswhere you can unlock unlimited ammo for your guns and i think you can unlock infinite health too. making the game like a movie invinsible characters and they will never run out of ammo. the reason this game is not as good as resident evil 2 is that it doesnt have enough bosses or big enemies even though you do fight nemesis a lot and always wondor will he stay dead this time or do i gotta kill him again. its still better to have more bosses.
3,Resident Evil 3 Nemesis,"I thought that this game was not even close to the other two. The graphics and everything are cool but the story line, zombies, and just the difficulty of the game lacked that of the first two. I think that most of the reason for this is because they did not spend enough time on the game, it wasn't very long after Resident Evil 2 came out that this game came out. I think the best part of the game is playing the mercenarie game after you beat it and the different costumes that you can get. All and all my suggestion would be not to buy the game because it is not worth it, just rent it and beat it, it is quite easy. I know from experience."
4,Harder than the first,"After playing this game for more than four hours i still can not get past one certain point. The graphics are a reminder of what made the first two of this trilogy a success. If you are into role playing games, I highly recommend this one."
3,Worst installment of the series,"The suspense of RE1 and RE2 were still there, but a weak plot and laughable difficulty made me wanting more. It seemed rushed and the voices were even worse than the usual mediocre RE fare. Definetly rent this game, but don't buy. You'll probably end up beating it when you rent it."
3,Survival Horror at its worst.,Usually I rent games first but I knew how good RE2 was and I had faith in RE3. WELL THAT WAS A STUPID MOVE!A very short game that I beat the night I purchased it and with only one character to use the game has little reply value and will most likely be a dissappointment to most RE fans.If you are a fan of RE then you will probably like the game but as for everyone who is just getting into the RE/Survival Horror games I think you should rent the game first or just think about getting RE2 instead.(or Dino Crisis)BE WARNED! RE2 is a much better game and by now it is probably a much better buy.
1,[ not good],"I rated this a 1 because it was the worst game that i have ever played in my life it makes u not want to buy antother resident evil game again.Its graphics [were bad],its music was corny it sounded like carnival music in a kids scare house,the zombies moans sounded like ..."
5,Just plain awesome.,"This game rocks. I was first in line to get it. It has greatly improved graphics from RE2. The backgrounds are improved, and so are the characters. The best part about it is that THERE ARE ABOUT 15 DIFFERENT KINDS OF ZOMBIES. The story is really great, always twisting and turning. Unfortunately, it's not as good as RE2.My favorite thing is the choices because they are cool. Also, The new dodge feature and the 180 turn is really great because they save you in tough situations. NEMISES WILL SCARE THE PISS OUT OF YOU, TRUST ME. The cinemas are cleaner ( though not as good as FF8's amazing cinemas, they are pretty high up there with Silent Hill's). This game has all the atmosphere. GREAT, AMAZING, SCARY, AWESOME."
3,Probably the scariest Resident Evil...,"Nemesis is one scary mess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!So beware!!He seems to be around every corner imaginable, and he's quite invincible, until the end, so don't get those hopes up! :-)A decent run-through, but a bit difficult.Difficulty: 7Difficulty, compared the hardest Resident Evil (RE Remake): 6Graphics: 6.5Characters: 6Sound: 6.5Replay-ability: 6 (You get more guns, I believe as well as other hidden bonuses).3.5 stars."
4,"""HATE THE LIVING, LOVE THE DEAD""","CAPCOM DOES IT AGIAN, ALTHOUGH RE3 HAS THAT ""BEEN THERE DONE THAT"" GAMEPLAY, IT'S STILL JUST AS SCARY, IF NOT SUSPENSEFUL LIKE THE FIRST IN THE SERIES. THIS TIME, IT'S NOT THE ZOMBIES THAT'LL SCARE THE $#&% OUT OF YOU, BUT THE NAMESAKE CHARACTER HIMSELF; NEMESIS, HE'S ONE BAD MONSTER, ARMED WITH A BAZOOKA, AND TENTICLES, YOU BETTER STOCK UP ON PLENTY OF AMMO. SOME OF THE GAME'S CONCEPTS BORROWS HEAVILY FROM CULT FILMS LIKE; DAWN OF THE DEAD, THE TERMINATOR AND JOHN CARPENTER'S ESCAPE FROM NY. PLUS THERE'S A BONUS MINI GAME AFTER BEATING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. WORD OF WARNING; THE PUZZLES ARE A PAIN IN THE @$$! )0= GOOD LUCK! YOU'LL NEED IT. HA,HA,HA,HA,HAH!"
2,Resident evil at its worst,"Resident evil 2, may i say, is one of the best games of all time. So was re1, re0, and re code veronica. But not resident evil 3. First of all, whats with the difficulty mode?!! U either put it on easy and it starts u with enough ammo to finish the rest of the game with, or u put it on hard and it makes it so u barely have enough. But the worst part is the tyrant. It chases u so u barely have a chance to explore. It literally follows u through doors and into new areas constantly! He's hard to kill and always comes back. Plus he can kill u in one or two hits and is fast. It takes away from the fun of the game. Forget this game and try resident evil 2 or one of the others..... you will thank me later."
3,My thoughts on the game.,"I didn't care for the game because the voices are terrible, the boss is to easy even on hard option. Also when playing against Nemesis sometimes you'll fight him in one room come back to fight him again after dieing and he'll be in a completely diffrent room all the way on the other side of the building your fighting him. Also zombies are way to easy to beat they should be harder or there should be alot more groups of them because it says all through the game and even shows in the begining movie that there is thousands of zombies but when playing the game you meet up with a zombie every 18 miles. This is'nt a game you want to buy unless your a hardcore RE fan."
3,"I loved RE2, but was disappointed by this one...","I really loved playing RE2, but this installation to the series wasn't as good.I beat the game very quickly, and did not see much need to go back and play again (like the dual storylines and multiple endings RE2 had).The Nemesis following me around thoughout the entire game was just plain annoying. For key plot points, it made perfect sense... but at other times he just ran around after me while I was trying to explore.You only switch characters once, and for a short amount of time.All in all, I was not as impressed by this game as I had expected. I definitely recommend renting/buying RE2 (it will take you longer to finish, that's for sure), and then renting RE3 if you are still interested in the series."
4,A cool 3rd option for the series.,"Let me start by saying that out of the 3 this one is the most improved in terms of the facility to handle the controls. I won't get into much detail because others have pretty much summed it up, but I will say that part 1 and 2 were a bit of a notch superior than this one, although it is expected, afterall the first two were classics. But they did a fine job in making a strong 3rd one. As far as the feeling of getting scared is concerned, the first two were scarier. Still a superb game! The puzzles are very good for most of the part because at times they can be hard which is challenging. However, it does not have that flavor of the first two, but nevertheless an entertaining time."
5,great game,"well,i was impressed the game is good but the thing i just dontget why do we have to have nemises everywhere we go we have fight him like 8 times,anyway resident evil 3was great the only promblem the camera angles are horriblebut resident evil 3 is good enough to have your fingers wrapped around the control stick for a long time.the graphics are greatbut resident evil 3 is not as good as resident evil 1 and 2but its still a great game"
5,Awesome!,"The person who wrote a review of the game being worser than Theme Crap or Papa the Rapper or something like that is STUPID! Don't let him fool you! I played this game and I liked it from the start. Just seeing a monster die just makes you feel a lot better than you were. Or shooting the nemesis and see it drop down makes you cool off from the sweating you did from the intense battle between you and nemesis. I swear, this game will make you jump at some parts and will make you oo and aww at different monsters you will be introduced to. And the music will make you so nervous, you'll wet your pants. I loved this game and I hope you guys will love it too. If you are a newy to these kind of games, be prepared to have bad dreams. And remember, never play any of the Resident Evil games from the series in the dark! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"
4,Great! but deffinitely not as difficult as I expected,"I thought the game was going to be more difficult. In fact, I found RE2 more difficult than this one. Also, I was expecting a larger game so, when the end came, I still had a lot of amo and first aid cans that was saving for a big confrontation with Nemesis. The good side of the game is that you will have more chances to be scared since the game is more dynamic. Graphics are, in my opinion, as good as RE2 (in my PC, though, RE2 looks even better than RE3). Since I liked both games, I can only say they are equally good. If you like the series you should deffinitely buy it, you will not regreat. If you do not have any of the 3 games and want the one with the best story, buy RE1 (but do not expect the best graphics). I hope that Capcom make the game also for Windows."
4,Scary Game,"ok, poeple, go buy this game now, but before you do, get lotsof extra underwear because u may need some extra because of the startling zombies and the unstoppable Nemesis, this game has some great graphics, capcom really took the psx to its limits, the game still has the prerendered backround (which will be fixed in resident evil: code veronica for DC) but u get used it and its not that bad, you got some nice moves, and cool aresenal of guns which are VERY hard to find at times, a cool parter with a seducing voice (ok he said it in the game and i just wanted to say that), the game overall is the most intense and scary of the RE series but the only thing wrong with it is the plot, the plot although twisting an turning, isnt as good as RE2 or RE, its more of something that would happen but u dont really know (or care) about, than a sequel, (prequel? there all the same)but still, it is a must for the 'adult' gamer."
5,A reveiw of Resident Evil 3,"I bought this game recently and I love it. Whenever the bad thing Nemisis appears it scares me to death. The Nemisis can follow through doors, it has a rocket launcher, and he runs faster than you. I also like how Carlos is one of the bad guys but you also get to control him at times. Personally this is my favorite game. Anyone who loves scary movies/games will love this game. I recomend this game for the fun factor and the sound is great to."
5,"classic,marvolous,fantastic game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","THIS GAME IS THE BBBBBBBEEEEEEESSSSSST!!! COOL GRAPHICS AND BRILLIANT PUZZLES!I LLLLLOOOOOVVVEEE BLASTING THOSE DIM-EYED- DOLTS CALLED ZOMBIES,FASINATING STORY,AND AN ALL-NEW NEMISIS!I ABSOLUTLY HAVE TO GIVE THIS CLASSIC GAME 5 STARS!SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GAME YOU WON'T REGRET BUYING,GRAB THIS GAME OFFYOUR LOCAL GAME-SHOP'S SHELVES!!!!!!"
4,NEMISIS! ! !,"This game is really fun but, that Nemisis freak really takes the fun out of it. At one point of the game you have to fight him 2 times in a row, and right after that you fall into a giant hole and have to fight a mutated worm. And I do mean 2 times in a row, like beat him, go through the next door and beat him again. Graphics are crisp and the zombies are sick looking, but it would be funner if Nemisis didn't show up so much. After a while it becomes repetitive and really annoying. So either run for your life or waste your ammo. Though, it's still fun to play."
4,"GREAT graphics, and is fun, but it is too short and easy.","The first time I played this it took a little over 7 hours to beat this game (it tells you how long it took you to complete it at the end), and I had no strategy guide or game shark. So it is shorter than RE 2, on the plus side it's also better looking than RE 2 too. I remember when Resident Evil 2 came out and many competent gamers felt that it was too easy, well in my opinion RE 3 is even easier.People that have never played any of the RE games may find this challenging, but RE vets will more than likely be able to beat it quite easily. On the plus side: it IS fun, and has very good looking back grounds.After you beat it you can play the ""Mercenaries: operation mad jackal"" mini game, and hopefully Capcom put in more things like this because it will add to the replay value."
3,What Do You Think?,"Ok, now i can see writing a very good review for ""Resident Evil 2"",but I just had to write something on this. Yes, I am a huge Resident Evil fan but this one I could live without.The One I would reccomend first would be ""Resident Evil"" or if you don't have a gamecube or you can't find the PS1 version, get ""Resident Evil 2""I think that is still the best one to date. some may call me crazy but that is the one i will always like.So, bottom line don't buy this one some this this is a good game don't let them fool you, don't get this one for sure. Good Luck Finding and Thanks!"
2,"basically, sucks","the camera angles [stink], so does the repetitive story, the graphics are pretty good, the only good thing about it is that you can blast ... some stupid lookin zombie things"
3,A step down...,"This is a step down from the high standard set in RE2. It's not scary, its too short, the graphics aren't as good as RE2 in many places, and it is way too easy. I beat this game the day I bought it after like seven hours of gameplay. Don't let the 3 in its name trick you. It is in no way a satisfying sequel, and serves better as a shortlived side story than a full blown sequel. There's no mystery because you no exactly what happened to the town and what's up with the T-virus. Also there's so much running around that it ruins the cluastrophobic room-to-room creepiness that was so great in the first two games. Capcom sold short in this game and I'm deeply disappointed!"
2,THIS GAME IS OVER BEFORE YOU CAN ENJOY IT!,"FIRST OF ALL THIS GAME IS FAR INFERIOR TO THE FIRST 2 INSTALLMENTS, IT IS SO EASY THAT I BEAT IT THE SAME DAY I BOUGHT IT. THE GRAPHICS HAVE NOT IMPROVED AT ALL FROM RE2 AND THE STORY LINE IS SHORT AND INCONCLUSIVE. THE CREATORS HAVE ALSO RAN OUT OF IDEAS FOR NEW WEAPONS, SO JILL VALENTINE HAS THE SAME WEAPONS SHE HAD IN THE FIRST GAME. I THOUGHT SEQUALS WERE SUSPOSED TO BE ABOUT PROGRESS, THIS GAME PLAYS MORE LIKE REGRESSION. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESIDENT EVIL 2 AND RESIDENT EVIL 2 SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESIDENT EVIL 3. THERE IS LESS VIOLENCE IN THIS GAME! THE MERCENARY MISSION IS SHORT AND THE REWARDS ARE NOT NEW TO THE RESIDENT EVIL WORLD (IE. GATLING GUN, ROCKET LAUNCHER) AND THE NEMISIS IS SIMPLY A SLIGHTLY MORE PERSISTENT VERSION OF THE TYRANT (TYRANT MEETS SCICCORMAN). IF YOU ENJOYED THIS GAME THAN YOU MUST NOT HAVE PLAYED THE FIRST TWO. THIS SERIES HAS LOST ITS IMPACT."
5,I MISS MY FRIEND,He loved to record in the studio!We used to gig together from 1982 in a club called Charlotte's in Manville NJ and through Shelly Productions opened for most of the major Golden Oldies groups and personalities.
2,Mexican Revolution Movie,I enjoy movies on the Mexican Revolution. This one is well below my expectations. The story line is not that good. It's really about the trials and tribulations of a messenger getting from point a to point b.
2,"Fun, but lots of problems","First off, I heard this game is being taken off shelves in some stores due to it's content. Well, I guess a game about criminals vs. law enforcement (COPS AND ROBBERS people) is so horrible that it should be taken off shelves while games like GTA remain where you can randomly walk anywhere, carjack anyone, kill anyone, and destroy anything....yeah that's much better for our youth. Now the TRUE problems with the game; the single player game is pretty lame. On Xbox Live it's about as fun as games get, but the problem is about 50% of the time people find a way to cheat and walk through walls and stupid stuff like that and it causes the game to crash (hence the 2 star overall). Way too many glitches."
1,WARNING TO PARENTS,This game scores points if you shoot a cop and even more if you grab in innocent person off the street and use them as a human shield.
1,Goes TOOOO FAR!,"The gameplay is rubbish aswell but thats not the reason i`m here.The game is more of a ""Cop Killing"" simualotor,which is un-necessory.GTA maybe controversial but atleast you`re not MADE to kill cops,also those cop chases in Driver were actually fun and not disturbing-but this 25 to Life just takes the bar to far!people forget that cops are actually normal people under that uniform,they may have famillies and are just paying for their bills and buying food for the family or something.I do generally like EIDOS games but i think all copies of 25TL should be scrapped-the game is sloppy,controvesial.overall i rate this game 1.3/10"
1,"NEVER, NOPE, NADA,NO CAN DO!","I truly wish the manufacturers would think twice about creating games such as these. You wonder why violence is so bad, and there is so little respect for our Law Enforcement agencies, this type of games is ONE reason why. (You know it!) It puts thoughts in the already ""troubled"" minds."
4,Excellent series,"This batman's sseries are great! The complete batman story is remade in this one, with a completly different batman, which is more realistic sort of. And with completly new stories."
1,Bundle costs more than individual discs,"I like the show just fine, but you should probably double check the pricing on the individual season sets. As it stands now, this is more expensive than just putting the 3 season sets in your cart separately."
3,Smaller than I expected,"Unit is as described in advertisement. I was dissapointed in the inner dimensions of the tub. Specs state for hands and feet, but you will need small feet if you are a male."
4,Overall good keyboard,"Ordered this keyboard for my boss, who likes the traditional, big keyboards (not the slim Mac keyboards that Apple is selling now). Personally, I found it to noisy when typing, but I use the new, slim Mac keyboard which is very quiet. My boss was quite happy with the keyboard except for the placement of the caps lock key. It is in a very unusual location (lower right of keyboard near the ctrl-alt keys). For that reason alone, he got a different keyboard. If you don't use caps lock much and like more traditional, big keyboards, I recommend this one, especially for Mac users. Setup was easy, and having that high-speed USB port on the keyboard was very handy. Overall a good keyboard for the money!"
1,Where's the CAPS LOCK?,"A real piece of junk:This is marketed as a MAC keyboard but who needs 2 CONTROL keys, one above the other?The SPACE bar is all crooked: higher on one end then on the other.The TAB key is sunken down from all the other keys.No CAPS LOCK key. WTFIt feels like I'm typing on a Commodore 64 keyboard and frequently double tyypess.DO NOT BUY THIS piece of junk - get a real Apple Mac keyboard."
5,Just make sure you have 2 free USB ports on your computer,"Best keybaord I ever used. I love how the keys have the graphics so I know what to press.LOVE that the ALL CAPS key was moved to the right side and is out of the wayThe keyboard feels nice when you type.Having the 2.0 USB port on the top of the keyboard is so convenient.I can't say enough about this keyboard. Ironically, on Amazon buying the Keyboard + Mouse COMBO was LESS EXPENSIVE than buying JUST the same keyboard LOL.Otherwise, this product ROCKS!"
2,A bit flimsy,"I'm not well schooled in computer hardware, so my concerns about this productare not about USB ports or whatever. I was unhappy at how light and flimsy this keyboard was in comparison with other Mac keyboards I have used. When it arrived about a dozen of the key tiles had come loose and had to be snapped back on. Also it feels as if I am typing on some kiddie toy rather than an Apple product. I bought this combo to accompany my MacBook when I travel, but now I'm worried about tile attrition and keyboarding frustration."
5,The perfect CD for the perfect class,"This CD has just the perfect length and tempos for a ballet class. Any teacher in any level would find it useful and it is worth every penny!Flor Olivares, New York"
2,very inaccurate,"While it's interesting that such an item exists, the excerpt given in amazon.com, one paragraph long, already has 2 major errors: Sucharitkul has not lived on Ancell Street for almost 20 years, and he is not represented by the Adele Leone Agency -- has not been for at least 10 years. Adele Leone is deceased."
5,Faces represents extraordinary insight into complex issues.,"Paul Thompson touches sensitive issues in black and white with ""Faces."" The African American expereince in America is still being defined. This effort embodies the sincere reflections and insight of an African American looking backwards and forward at the same time. I think it is exceptional and the audio tapes make it convienent. Dr. Bill Adkins, Senior PastorGreater Imani ChurchMemphis, Tennessee"
3,Ok for the price,Its light weight but serves the purpose. I had a 60 watt bulb but it attracted too many bugs so i placed a smaller watt bulb in it.
4,Wall Mount Paper Towel Holder,"This is a sleek but sturdy paper towel holder. It is narrow enough to fit in most spaces. We use it on a cupboard door,"
4,Made in USA! But why are the screws not attached?,"It's nice that this product is made in the USA and so affordable. I guess part of that cost is not packing screws into the packaging. They were just floating around in my box. You could hear them rattle if you shook the package. They're also a little longer than I need, so I may need to stop by home depot to find a shorter pair."
4,Does the job (and you dont have to screw it in the wall),This paper towel holder is pretty sturdy; does the job well. What I like most is that you don't have to screw it into the wall (although that would make it more secure). I used 3M hanging strips.
3,"Two Pianos, one opinion","Debussy, Ravel: Complete Works for Piano Duet and Two PianosThis is probably an older recording. The two-piano sisters don't shine as they do in later recordings. The sound of the recording is not so good--particularly the highs. I tried balancing the bass and treble with some success. Another EMI recording of the pianists has the same problem."
5,A must have!!!,"If you are teaching kindergarten through second grade, you must have this and use it in your classroom. It has activities that covers every area of phonemic awareness. It gives you many activities for each section so your children will never get bored with your lessons. Uses all modalities. I can't say enough good things about this book."
3,Good ideas--but I've seen better!,"This book is a fair book. It has good activities but none of them are ""ready to go"", so there is a lot of prep. As a reading specialist and first grade teacher I prefer the books below. I use them on a daily basis and find them indispensable! They both come with ready to use activities that are motivating and fun! The kids absolutely love the activities!!Quick Small Group Reading Activities for Struggling Studentsby Sandy TurleyANDPhonemic Awareness: Playing With Sounds to Strengthen Beginning Reading Skillsby Jo Fitzpatrick and Catherine Yuh"
1,not worth it,"I just bought this book and don't recommend it, it has very simple activities with very little explanation about them, this kind of activities you can easily think of them even my grandma has better ideas that the ones that come on this book I feel disappointed about this book I had to give a star to this book even it does not deserve it."
2,"A good brush, but NOT boar bristle","I bought this for my wife, because her sister has a boar bristle brush (matching this description) that she loves, loves, loves. However, the brush available here is NOT boar bristle, but nylon. Yes, the description says this, but even so I must tell you the bristles are very thick and not of the same quality as the brush I was actually expecting. That is to say: the nylon bristles in no way are a good replacement for boar bristle, as the description implies. Other than the bristles, everything seems to be of good quality (but the bristles make a brush, don't they?). This is still a good value if you are looking for a brush as long as you know what to expect. I, unfortunately, am still on the hook to find a real boar bristle brush."
2,JG Characters don't fit with modern setting,"There is certain type of naiveté that the women in JG novels tend to have that just doesn't work in a modern setting. And though you could maybe say that an Alfa male is an alfa male in any era, she manages to make them predictably boring. After a while it just seems like you're reading about the same saccharin sweet characters over and over and over again. I was a huge fan of her historicals. And though I have remained faithfull reader so far, I think this book marks the end of the road for me. Unless, I'm terribly desperate for something to read. :) If JG completely refuses to go back to historicals, then maybe she could try Futuristic novels where the virgin planet gets invaded by maurauding males. Just a thought. :)"
4,Still Great,"I've only read Garwood's Historical Romances-which I really enjoy. I was skeptical to this new series, but I was pleasantly surprised. The suspense, romance, and ""who done it"" were entertaining. I read the book in two days. One, because I have a lot of time to read and two, because it was a good story."
2,"If you're old enough to have hot sex, you're old enough to stop whining.....","Just so I'm sure I understand, please allow me to repeat the facts as I understand them. Your financial situation is about to result in your loosing everything you own, everything you've worked for. Further, your little sister is about to loose her chance to pursue an education, something that she desperately needs, the reader realizes after listening to her for only a handful of sentences. But wait...all is not lost.....the ever present estranged Uncle leaves money, and not just money, eighty million dollars. Yes, Eighty Million Dollars. But alas, our heroine has decided she does not want the dirty money because of the attitude and unfortunate vocabulary of the erstwhile Uncle.I;m sorry...that's all. you lost me....I can abide many things but a stupid, whiny heroine....just no."
4,Cute.,"It's fun and easy to read.Meet, Kate MacKenna (business woman and sister)struggling to make her ""candle business"" successful when someone tries to blow her up. She flees to the bedside of her friend and becomes involved with her best friends brother, the ruggedly handsome cop, Dylan Buchanan. Through a series of misadventures and complications, Dylan is asked by his sister to go to Kate and protect her from a ""vicious killer""...afterall, someone mistakenly blowing up you once may be an accident, but when you are involved in a bombing a second time, more than likely someone is probably trying to kill you! Kate and Dylan soon discover that Kate has inherited millions and conclude that that is probably why her life is in danger. As they solve the mystery of who wants to her dead, they also grow more in love. And although you will not be surprised who is behind it all, you will enjoy a light enjoyable story."
3,disappointed... again,"As always I pre-ordered Julie's newest book hoping to get something exciting, romantic and humorous just like Mercy had been. But it seems Julie can never repeat her best Buchanan book, nor can she write as great work as her historical romances.I thought a lot why I got this feeling that something is missing, and figured it out.I myself love family series because I can meet my favourite characters again and again, know what happens with them later etc. (see Nora Robert's family series - the Quinn boys or the Concannon girls).Anybody met in this book Nick or Theo? Any words about Farher Tom or not to mention my favourite one (not Buchanan), the BEST character of her first two Buchanan stories - Noah? Where is he???Why is it called a series? Because the boys have got the same surname? That not makes it a real family series. I miss my favourite heroes!Julie, _you_make_a_big_mistake_ ignoring the readers' favourite characters. I think you'd better write historical romances again!"
3,Not the story I was hoping for....,"While this book wasn't bad, it was kind of bland. I didn't find Kate or Dylan to be particularly interesting. My major one issue with this book is that as a reader I'm suppose to believe that Kate and Dylan have known each other for years, but there is little to know backstory about this time. This is one of Garwood's books that I felt needed a prologue of some type so the reader could experience Dylan and Kate's relationship prior to being embroiled in sometype of crisis.That being said, the book was an enjoyable read, but it follows basically the same formula as Garwood's other contemporary novels. The character I was most interested in Slow Burn was Jordan, and I was disappointed that we didn't see more of her. Particularly, as Kate was the typical romance heroine and Dylan the typical romance hero. After reading Garwood's other books, I'm far more interested in Jordan, Noah Clayborne and Aidan (from Murder List), than I am in the rest of the Buchannan brothers."
2,Forgettable - Not Garwood's Best,"I bought it in hardback when it first came out, and I can honestly say that it's a forgettable venture on Garwood's part. I love almost every one of her historical romances, and I LOVED her first contemporary, ""Heartbreaker"", but I'm convinced that her contemporaries are on a ""good one""/""bad one"" pattern. I like only every other contemporary that she puts out. Half of them are duds.""Slow Burn"" is formulaic and lacking in creativity and passion in the romance department- the characters are not ones that I connected with or can root for with enthusiasm. Garwood seemed enamored with the idea of putting in as much action and explosions as she possibly could, but there wasn't enough downtime to have character development. Not enjoyable.If you want to read a good JG contemporary, I recommend ""Heartbreaker"", ""Mercy"", and ""Murder List""."
3,"Good commute listening, but no substance","This is one of Julie Garwood's 'lighter' books, as in frothy with little substance. It's an okay listen when you're on a long commute to/from work, but I doubt I would have finished it otherwise. The reader is quite good, maintaining specific accents and voices for the different characters."
2,Love Garwood but not this book,"I have been a big fan of Julie Garwood's historic fiction.I have bought every contemporary fiction book she has produced in the last couple of years but find them lacking her usual rich story lines and dialogue. With all due respect, I hope Julie goes back to historical, she is master of the genera. I can recommend ""Ransom"", ""The Secret"", ""The Prize"".Slow Burn starts off so well and seems like it will be whitty but quickly moves into a crazy plot line that makes everyone seem truly stupid. I suspect the book is setting up two more for each sister introduced (much in the N. Roberts methodology)."
1,Slow Burn,"Julie Garwood was my favorite author for few years now. I was anticipating again a good read.....well,what a dissapointment this book was! I can't believe she just....lost her touch.Not a plot, no humor, not even a nice love story.Nothing!!!"
3,Slow Burn Review,"I am a huge Julie Garwood fan and have read most of her stuff. I am only giving this one 3 stars by rating it against her other work. I was a bit disappointed in this one after loving her past books. I don't know what it was, I enjoyed the main characters but something was missing. I will say that I enjoyed reading the story and it was a good book but not her best. I think Julie should write her next book with the youngest sister going to Scotland to see her inherited land, might be fun for her to write about Scotland today since she does such a good job of it with her historical novels.Still a huge Garwood fan, this one just didn't rate the highest on her list."
2,A waste of time!,"This book started promising enough, with what appeared to be a dual plot. One..someone is trying to kill her, and two, someone is trying to steal her business. Well except for the a few meantions in the beginning about her mother supposely signing away her business to pay medical payments, and one brief phone call from a supplier saying someone came in and said the business was now hers, that is the last you heard about it till the very last chapter in the book. Then they meet at the bank, and then its over in two seconds. So much for suspense and intrigue. Found it boring, and dull.....a very hard read!"
4,Enjoyable read.,I have read all of the books in this series and really enjoyed them. This one has a way of making you laugh and keeping you guessing at times as well. Julie Garwood is one of my favorite authors and this book is a fun and entertaining read. Really enjoyed it.
4,Sweet,"Enjoyed Dylan's character, and the ladies' roles were all well developed and easy to embrace. I find comfort in my little fantasy world as Garwood links familiar characters through the story lines. Similar formulas among her modern plots, but consistency can be comforting."
4,"Suspense, so-so romance, little humor","I could not put this book down, however, the romance was just so-so and I missed the laugh-out-loud humor and the great chemistry and romance that jumps off the pages in her other books. I was looking for great dialogue between Kate and Dylan and didn't get it, and I would have liked a funnier or just more fun relationship/dialogue between Kate and Jordan - such as the relationshiop between Noah and Father Tim or Noah and Nick from Heartbreaker. Still it is worth the read. Gotta love the Buchanans - would like to see more Buchanan family in the books and not just mentioned in passing."
3,Good but not her best,"I have read all of Julie Garwood's book so I kinda know what I'm talking about. I love most of her books, read some of them dozens of times already, but this one, I cannot say I really love.Although the plot is suspenseful, the characters lovable and the dialogue's funny and witty like all of JG's novels, I was not completely satisfied with the whole book. I think there were a lot of scenes missing (like an important event just being explained in a few paragraphs, instead of actually writing it detail for detail) and also there were not a lot of character description and development to make them endear more to us readers.It's a good novel but it could be better."
2,Not the ending I wanted,"I agree with a lot of the negative reviews for this book, and yes, I usually love JG. The romance could have been stronger between the h&h; it did seem at times to be just thrown in to meet the requirement of a romance, still, I was rooting for them. SPOILER ALERT: What I did not like the ending. Granted, it was noble of the character to not want to accept her uncle's fortune considering how he obtained it, but how about replacing the things she lost because of this will (i.e. her car blown up, her business supplies blown up at the warehouse, the loss of her time away from her business, etc.). It was pretty hard for me to swallow, especially since she has to take out a loan for her business. In this economy it seems she would have considered this. Also, while it was thoughtful to donate it all in her mother's name (someone her uncle hated), how about trying to get some of it back to all those people it was taken from? Or at least make an effort. Just my humble opinion."
4,Julie Garwood fan,"This is not her best work, but worth reading. The characters needed to be developed a little more and the story skipped around a little, but still enjoyable. I wish Ms. Garwood would write Noah's story. I keep hopeing."
1,Not What I Expected,"Over the years I have read all of Julie Garwood's books. I have always thought she is an exceptional author and could not wait to get my hands on her next amazing story. This novel was highly dissapointing. The character's lacked depth. The storyline seemed to drag. The little bit of romance thrown into the novel could not even be refered to as romance. Overall, this book is not what I expected from Julie Garwood. I would really love to read a new book from her that is up to par with her older novels!!!"
2,"Way, way below standards","This book is the last straw for me. I'm an ardent fan of JG's since the Clayborne brides. Heartbreaker and Mercy were quite good and I expected better stuff from then on. Instead, we get the same predictable setting and prototype characters. She seems to want to write a book of all the Buchanan brothers. Very,very disappointing thus far. Murder List was excruciating and when I thought that things couldn't get worse, she comes up with Slow Burn. I'd wish she'd just write Noah Clayborne's book and be done with the whole series. Hopefully, she'd write a great book for Noah Clayborne."
1,WHAT A JOKE!!!!!,"I can't believe someone would have the nerve to place a pricetag of $25.95 on this piece of drivel!!! Fortunately, I was able to check it out at the library, or I would be howling. The storyline was ridiculous, the dialog was juvenile, and I got the distinct feeling this author was just trying to fill up pages with meaningless conversation among the characters. The romance wasn't even believable. I could go on and on, but the bottom line is don't waste your money. I won't be reading any more of this author's contemporary romances. I can't imagine the sequels to this book will be any better."
5,Fabulous!,"Another terrific read from Julie Garwood. I really love it when she links characters in various books and the Buchanan family are some of my favorites. While the mystery of the who did it and/or why is consistent in her novels, Ms Garwood continues to find unique situations for her characters, and Kate and Dylan are no exception. From start to finish, this is one tale that you won't want to put down."
3,SLOW...Slow Burn,"After an explosive beginning, this novel did a ""slow burn"" and then just sort of fizzled out. It lacked the intensity and intrigue of the other Buchanan novels. It was worth the read, but I don't think I'll be re-reading it any time soon."
1,Did I miss Something???,"Did I miss something? I used to read JG for the romance, the sweetness and the chemistry between her characters. I like mystery novels too, but JG just doesn't ""have it"". I miss her historicals and the way Heartbreaker and Mercy were written. Please go back to those! Also, please put us out of our misery and right Noah Clayborne's story...then go back to historicals."
2,Fire's Out,My first book by this author and I will try to avoid her in the future. I found the sisters just too dumb to be believed. The hapless victim left to fend for herself is getting to be an old over used scene in a lot of so called mysteries. They always think the case is solved and go galloping off leaving the intended defenseless and unprotected. Mediocre story at best. Don't know where the title came from.
3,Wrong item,I pushed the wrong button and ended up with this item and have returned it as directed. Am still waiting for the final confirmation that my credit card has been adjusted. That it has taken longer than expected is probably related to the holidays. Thanks. J. Shaw
2,Slow Burn is Middle of the Road,"""Slow Burn"" is a book that is a middle of the road, okay book. The author tries to double dip into the romance and the mystery genres and hits both marks on the fair side. The main characters, Kate and Dylan, aren't developed well and neither is the plot. Kate finds herself involved in several near-death ""accidents"" and Dylan comes to be her protector of sorts. The book is not terrible and a lot of the concepts such as Kate unknowingly being an heir to money that a lot of other people would like to have is good. However, there was a lot of potential for story development that just didn't happen. If you love a good mystery or a good romance novel, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a quick, light book that doesn't require much effort than this would be a good selection."
3,Characters with potential despite an unlikely plot,"Kate MacKenna is a successful businesswoman who gets called home to Silver Springs, South Carolina for her dying mother. Upon her mother's death, Kate discovers that her mother used her business as collateral on a loan due in 30 days. At the same time, her best friend Jordan Buchanan needs her in Boston as she undergoes surgery. To top things off, Kate survives two nearby explosions that were not coincidences. Jordan sends her brother Dylan, a Boston policeman to help. Being called back into the family fold once her uncle dies stretches the narrative thin. Kate flip-flops after refusing her uncle's bequest, to taking it to spite her cousins. Where were her sisters? What happen with Reece and Isabel? What happened to her friend Carl? Dylan and Kate keep the story afloat but a lot of other things are left ignored."
3,Disappointing,I miss the old Julie Garwood novels. This book had little chemistry and little character exploration.
4,lives up to the name attitude,Attitude was like warzone but more match types and a much bigger roster and his a fun game.
5,The World Wrestling Federation Has got a Serious Attitude!,"This is a great game and was Acclaim's last game for The World Wrestling Federation. WWF Attitude is the game following WWF Warzone. However the games graphics have got batter and the sound is just as awesome. The game point to WWF Attitude is the roster.The game has all of the big time Superstars In The World Wrestling Federation. Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, The Undertaker, Kane, And many more.If you don't have WWF Attitude then get it now!AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE CAUSE STONE COLD SAID SO!!!!!!!!"
4,Solid wrestling game,"I personally own this game and can testify to how good it is. WWF attitude has eccellent character selection, and create a player mode....for its time. Unfortunately it is getting lost in the shadow of games like Smackdwon 2 with its quick executing of moves, unlike Attitude, and its enormous backstage area, unlike attitude. But on the good side it has some things other games don't, tag team Gauntlet and its huge hidden character selection that you are always trying to unlock. Great game, i would reccommend it to anyone who likes slowerpace games."
2,nothing great BUT BETTER TO COME,THERE HAVE BEEN DAYS SINCE A PS GAME WAS RELEASD BUT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT FUTURE RELEASES OF PS GANES EMAIL AT ZXC_SAURABH@rediffmail.com
1,ACCLAIM SUCKS,"THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE WORST WWE GAME EVER CREATED. THANK GOD FOR THQ. IF THQ CAME IN ALL THE WWE GAMES WOULD HAVE SUCKED REALLY BAD. DON'T RENT THIS GAME, DON'T BUY THIS GAME, DON'T EVEN ASK FOR IT. THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS, THE VOICE OVERS SUCK, CREATE A CHARACTER SUCKS. EVERYTHING FOR THIS GAME SUCKS. DON'T BUY IT."
3,Great voicework (not much else),"This game is only worth checking out for the great voiceover work. The gameplay itself is pretty bad. If you can pick this game up cheap, do it."
3,Smackdown blows this away!!,Well this wrestling game was it and I played it a lot. The moves were tough to pull off and sometimes didn't work all the time. Nevertheless this was a hell of a lot of fun. Trust me.....save your money and buy Smackdown! or something else from THQ. It blows this away.
5,THE BEST GAME EVER!,"This game is outstanding!Ive been waiting for this game to come out for almost a year and when I finally got it, it did not disappoint. The graphics are the best ive seen on a playstation. There are alot of modes such as the awesome career mode. I love the create a player mode. Its almost as fun fighting a match. The entrances are brilliant! If you love WWF, get this game!"
4,ESPECTACULAR...,"El nuevo juego de acclaim postula a ser el juego mas impresionante e inovador a lo que Lucha libre se refiere, con graficos mejorados, crea tu propio PPV, y con mas de 20 modos de juego WWF Attitude es una execelente opcion para los Fanaticos del Wrestling...OH HELL YEAH!!!"
1,Do not waste your time and money,Horrible game!its so hard and stupid you can't do any moveS. The graphics stink! It's really that bad. Save your money for smacdown. ~ SnowEater11 Weymouth MA
1,WWF Attitude,This game is boring.The characaters are stupid and so is the game with the worst graphics in history.All the wrestlers walk like their on crack and talk even worse!
2,Don't buy this game!,"This is one of the worst wrestling games ever! I played it at a friend's house, and here are the problems with it: Too slow(It took so long for this game to load.)Bad graphics(The crowd looked like a big blur, and when I created a player I made him so fat, but still the computer picked him up easily and threw him, as if he was skinny.) The areanas waere dull, and the announcers started to say the same thing over and over again.Rent it first!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GUAGE,"I bought this and put it in one of our rooms for a couple of hours then I brought in my AMPROBE and another guage and found that this one was off by 20% with humidity and 1.2 degrees.Also, the company that it comes from wanted a 10% restocking fee."
5,best ever,"I have used this delightful wee thing for years - I have 6 of them. THey enable me to monitor at a glance the temp/humidity of each room. SInce we operate a woodstove, this is helpful info - also in bsement and even garage - I can tell if it freezes (or HAS frozen - there is a memory with lowest and hightest in 24-hour period). One of my best purchases EVER."
5,A MUSICAL ENCOUNTER OF THE THIRD KIND,"The moon landing sparked the imagination of Jazz fusion musicians during the early 70's,I heard it for the first time at 12,I heard the lyrics in an instrumental album through the alto sax;loved it then and today at 38, my favorite along with Weather Report's Mysterious Traveler, you've got to hear it!re"
5,One of the best electronic jazz albums ever recorded.,"I also have worn out the LP, which I have owned since the '70s. I played the CD for my 22 year old music freak nephew and he was blown away. A must have."
5,At Their Early Best,"This is Passports most successful early album and it's crisp,eleaborate fusion production is a good enough reason why.The over-flowing ""Homuculus"" and the clanging and smooth titaltrack make for an intense,powerful first side.Side B starts withthe brief but potent funk rocker ""Jaboo"",followed by a trio of tunes the get progressively gentler.It's memorable,musical andimpeccably constructed and the level of improvisation here willmake this palatable to jazz,funk and rock fans alike.A veritablecollosus!"
1,review on a review/interview,"I was expecting an abstract on the content of the book, not a (6 page) review/interview with the ""guru"" on the ideas behind it. The kind that would appear in a promotional leaflet. And it did not inspire me to look for a book on the subject from this guy, he may spend the whole book revolving around ... ""much ado about nothing""."
1,"As Wendys would have said....""Where's the beef?""","I expected some sort of publication worth reading; instead I received in essence what could best be summed up by a dust cover for a book.This was nothing more than a brief biography on the author and a cheap sales pitch.I was disappointed that Amazon didn't tell us up fron that the ""book"" was only SIX (6) pages."
4,"Very good handbook, basic tool for training and development",It is a handbook that all the HR Training areas should have to support their efforts. It is very easy reading and contains very detailed practical information.
3,MIxed feelings,"I really liked the beautiful animation of this video and the key characters are quite endearing. The irish accents and ""river dancing"" sequences are charming. However, I found the story to be a bit too dark and anxious. Sean, the main character, has to face being separated from his parents, the near death of his friends, surviving a harsh winter, and more than one close call from a sinister fox all in the course of 25 minutes! If your little one is sensitive or highly imaginitive, this is definitely a video you need to watch with your child just to keep the anxiety level down. We'll definitely get our money's worth from this purchase but this video probably won't get the steady use that some of our favorites receive. We'll be sticking to gentler fare at our house...Little Bear, Kipper, and Spot."
3,Software problem but otherwise ok.,"I could not get the included software IPView software to work correctly in wireless mode. I was able to get the WPA encryption on wireless to work ok and image was ok for the price. It took more time to figure this thing out that it should have. However, it does have WPA encryption (not WPA2 however).Support from India was level one and they referred me to level 2, email. Have not heard back from them yet, but I found that Trendnet sells the same camera and I downloaded the updated software from them and it works fine."
5,almost as good if not better than FF8,Im only half way through it but so far its great! When i played it i wasnt expecting much i had just finished FF8 and i needed despratly a game to play since i have no lif. anyway before i new it i was wraped up in a storyline and had played for 11 hours straight its a wonderful game you start out as fei and meet pirates and girls its got everything. you are basically stuck in an ever progressing war between to countries. its a hard plot to figure out and there are surprises every where the characters are quite blocky and instead of cinimatics its got anime so it was a deffinate change from what im used to all in all so far this game ROCKS !-
5,A unexpected surprise!,Xenogears is a SUPER game! I love all the chacters and gears. And the extra jump option is a way cool change. I love the fighting option in Kislev Imperial Capital. It's really awsome when the 2 player option becomes available. It has some humor(and Chu-chu's soooo cute!) I urge you to go to the store and buy it right now! Even grils will enjoy this game) I was going to pick the 4 and a half because there was 2 scenes I didn't approve of. The characters are realistic and in depht . Ramsus and Miang really are hard to beat in the last battle. This game gives Final Fansy 7 a run for it's money!
5,U MUST TRY THIS GAME!!!,xenogears is a great game xenogears is a little bit differnt then other rpg's in stead of just attacking if u pick attack if u have a robot with u u can pick to use powerful move x strong move square and weak move triangle this game is about a person named fei who one day is in his village lahan and it get;s attacked after disobeying the town rules he must move out of the town after that he meets other people and goes on a misson to save the world from doom
3,xenogears,ok here is the deal. i liked ff7 & ff8 but of all the rpg games i have played this one by far kills the rest of the compition. the fact is the story behind this game will capture anyone. this is a must for all gamers and besides the story has a lot to do with god or the lack there of one.
5,This is a game,deep....to play the game is to think and to think is to be and i think thats all that needs to be said
3,"Excellent, but...","Xenogears had me hooked from the beginning. You'd swear that you were really in the game because the characters are so lifelike in their personalities. Even though the 2-D characters looked kind of awkward with the 3D backgrounds, this doesn't detract from the game. The music is great too, along with the anime scenes in a few areas. The storyline has a lot of science fiction though, so it might be confusing to some people. Unfortunately, on Disc 2, the storyline fizzed out. The game became a linear sequence of events that you had to do until the very end, when you have to fight the final boss. I felt like I was being lead along like a sheep on Disc 2. That is my main gripe. Other than that, you'll find a winner here. If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars."
5,Rivals FF,"Xenogears is one of the greats. eventhou it doesn't have the popularity that FF, it is as good as or better than any FF game. don't get me wrong FF is a great game, but this game has all that you could ask for in a game. its has everything. a great plot, outstanding characters, awesome gameplay, and beautiful art. like FF, Xenogears also has movies that are something to cherish. with the new game coming out begining of next year,a prequal to Xenogears, i hope that it is everything and more than the original."
5,Best game of all time,"This is by far my favorite game ever. It has an incedbly deep storyline focusing on religion, but having many other elements as well. The character development was phenominal, better than any other RPG I've played(I have played many). However, this game is not for everyone. It is very, very long (it took me 80 hours on my first playthrough), and a lot of that time is spent reading cutscenes. If you do not have patience this game is not for you."
4,Great Game,"Xenogears is a great game. The story line is fantastic and the graphics were excellent for their time. The only flaw I saw in it was the battles with the Gears, I found it quite boring compared to the regular battles and it often slowed the game down. The battles out of the Gears are alot more fun and exciting. Overall a great game with a good replay value...pick it up."
3,Coolest game,"This is on of the best games out there, it's SO fun! what i look for in an rpg is, firstly, the story, secondly, the characters, and thirdly, the music. and Xenogears has great Chaacters, story, and music! worth the money"
5,really really good,"What can I say? It's one of the best RPG'S I've ever played. Yea, it's got the usual that most RPG gamers are looking for...good storyline, graphics, cool characters, so on and so on. IMO there are only two drawbacks. Number 1: Every now and then, something is thrown at you, that will make you go ""HUH! "" unless you have really good memory...(or it you play the game twice...then you start going ""OH! "" ^_^;; Number 2: Everything gets all fuzzy when there's a close up. The neat thing about xenogears is the deathblows. You know, combos and stuff, and then you can combine the deathblows to make what square calls combos, and what I'd like to call SUPERcombos. Ugh, I could go on and on about all the good stuff...I'll stop here. Hope this was helpful! Xenogears is a really really good! BUY IT NOW! Have fun ^_-"
3,I have played a lot better,"This is just the plain truth, I have learned that noteverything square does i great, case in point: XENOGEARS. You realizeat the end of the game that it is just not that fun, sure the graphics are great yada yada yada, but the actual enjoyment you receive from playing this game is not there. For crying out loud, there are practically zero secrets in this game! In the end when you get the airship(always happens) and get to explore the world there is almost nothing to do maybe....2 secrets. What is that about? Plus all those neat armors you get at the end of the game cant be used! THE ENTIRE END STAGE IS FOUGHT IN LARGE COMBAT MODE. In summary I give the game a 3 and if I had one word to describe it....""eh"". END"
2,Not as good as it could be.,"This game starts off great with an interesting storyline and a unique fighting style, but as the game continues, you find yourself falling asleep from the long, and I mean long story sections of the game. There is too much dialog and not enough exploring in this game. This game could have been made a lot better."
5,epic underated ledgend,This is one of the best ps1 turn based rpg games i've had the pleasure of playing. With by far the most in depth story line a game has ever offered it keeps you wondering throughout the whole game eager for the answere's towing you along with one the the most innovative and interestingly interactive combat systems since legend of dragoon.The game offers a rare style of movement unlike other games of the time with a pasted background you can navigate this instead allows you a full 360 view of a completely 3d explorable environment making walking around towns alot of fun. The graphics were great for the time and are still good enough to want to replay the game. This is my all time favorite game for a reason.
5,THE best RPG,I could ramble on and on about this game but I am going to make it short. Xenogears has an excellent story line along with excellent gameplay an excellent battle system and excellent characters. Added all up this is THE best RPG I have every played. It may not have state of the art graphics anymore but it was worth every sleepless night I had. Highly recommended.
4,Rare,This game is the rarest game on ps1. It's one of the best rpg's I've played so far and the combos are wicked.
5,These guys are goooood! And I'm a BEGINNER!,"No, I'm serious... I'm as newbie, green, novice as you can get! I decided to get into swing just recently so I went out and bought quite a few different ""how to"" videos just so I don't feel COMPLETELY stupid when I take my first lesson next month. This one takes the cake. It's thorough, intelligent, and well done. I recommend it highly."
2,Big City Swing,A very perky couple moves you through the dance steps. However the material covered was covered a bit too fast for my level of ability. Also problematic was that the rear close-up shots of the male dancer are often obscured by his pants being too long and draging on the floor.
4,Informative but slow,"Has all the right steps and moves, but the instructions are a little slow. They even talk slow."
4,Review of An Introduction to 6-Count swing,"Excellent but not quit what I expected would reccommend this, I plan to later buy the second DVD in the series"
5,Seattle Weather,"These are the coolest and cleanest wipers I have ever used.....and I used quite a few. I have them installed on my Lexus GS300 and I also use Rain-X solution on all my windows, so that also helps."
3,Disappointed,"I have always loved Bosch wiper blades, but these disappointed me big time. I'm guessing it has more to do with my windshield than the blades, I have a Honda. These wiped once and then they couldn't clear my windshield after."
1,Avoid like the plague,"I was feeling short on cash so I went against my better judgement and bought maxtor. I work at a computer store and I new maxtor sucked already, but I was being cheep. It lasted me one month, then died straight up. RMA'ed it to maxtor, or course they mixed it up and it took 1 month to get my ""refurb"". 4 months later its dead again. I'm now about to RMA it again, save yourself the hassel and spend the extra money on an IBM or anything else."
5,Love it,"I remember Keely Smith but I never heard her do the rendition of ""Sing, Sing ,Sing,"" Benny Goodman. I'm a singer and I've done this in her style. It's great"
3,Boot review,"They arrived in a timely fashion. Like the look on line, but wish the boot could be folded down more. The way they are made you can only fold boot down maybe 2 inches."
5,Good boots for costume,"Bought these boots for the local Renaissance festival. Unfortunately, I had to buy the larger size, but I had some ""water shoes/watersocks"" available and slipped them inside and my feet fit now. The thigh part will not stay up if you want them fully extended, though I have muscular & short legs. Rolled down to just above knee works great for any pirate or renaissance like costume. Love them, especially for the price."
4,Good Costume Boots,"These are excellent costume boots. Soles are not super heavy and they come in good sizes. Height truly is above the knee/thigh high even on guys over 6'1"". True to fit."
5,"My basic, all-purpose beverage for 15+ years","It's been well-documented that almost everyone needs to increase their water intake. I'm one of those people who don't like to drink plain water, so this enables me to get my liquid in a way that I enjoy.My parents considered soft drinks an item to be consumed as a treat, thank goodness - thus I never developed the habit of consuming those sugar/calorie-laden beverages from dawn to dusk as I see so many others do, particularly younger people (I am 55). I do like my black decaf coffee in the morning but when I want a cold drink I turn to fruit juice or, most often, some Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger.I don't know if Lemon Zinger's healthier than regular tea, other than being decaf, but I enjoy the flavor, which is like regular iced tea with a squeeze of lemon. For some reason the lemon flavoring makes it unnecessary for me to add any sugar, just as when I have regular iced tea at a restaurant."
2,Don't waste your money,"Certainly NOT worth the premium price. Bowl is too small for the average disk of shaving soap that you can buy in most stores.The ceramic handled razor VERY easily, and constantly, falls out of the holder, which caused the ceramic handle to break.The only good thing about the entire set is that the badger brush is nice and the bristles have held up well."
3,GAME TIP!,"to fight against akuma choose your character and hold the A and B button until the match starts your opponent will be akuma. to fight against bison choose your character then hold A,B and the select button until the match starts your opponent will be bison. it's a great game the only complaint is like what a gamer said it's a fix story line that your character gets to fight certain characters all the time for example if you play as ken the only characters you fight are guy, sodom, birdie, rose, charlie, chunli and ryu. everytime you play as ken you fight only those characters. it's just the same as the other players that you choose you will only get to fight certain opponents all the time which leads to boredome. and the endings are just writings that you will see your character talking to someone else in words. it's good but you will get bored pretty fast."
1,QBASIC book - my overveiw.,I think that this book is too tough to follow up with. I really understood the language better by taking a course than reading the book. The book is really confusing and rambles on about nothing.
4,Great Children's Literature,"This is basically the story events of the Donkey Kong Country video game put into a written format (with pictures) for children. It would be a great book for any kid, especially one working on reading skills. The font size is quite large as well. Some of it reminds me exactly of the writing style I had when I was about eight years old, and I think that perhaps that could have been at least a little improved. Otherwise, it's fun and enjoyable."
1,Ok,This was not what I was looking for. I guess I should have read the ad a little bit more. My kids liked it. It did have some coloring on the pages. No big deal. Thank you.
2,"Kong Bound Lost, by K. Rool","It just sometimes surprises me when it comes to strategy guides for video games, and from the gamemakers and how they can be so bound in the opposite directions with help for video games. That was the case then, and now. With this strategy guide for Donkey Kong Country, it really doesn't seem to bring out a whole lo with not enough visual help within each course, and a failing grade for access to all the bonus levels and features. Arguably, even though it was issued in 1995, when Donkey Kong Country was only on the Super Nintendo, there just isn't enough here to take on the masters. If you have a the original authorized guide only from Nintendo, whether it is from then, or the recent one for the Game Boy Advance, stick with it. Otherwise, don't buy this guide."
2,Elvis tries to be Billy Joel,"EC strikes out with this one. While there ARE some very good songs (""Other Side of Summer,"" ""Harpies Bizarre""), most of this album evokes Billy Joel and John Lennon at their most OVERWROUGHT and melodramatic. Too many songs are over-arranged/cluttered/over-done with ""everything but the kitchen sink""-type production.I don't expect EC to keep re-doing ""This Years Model"" but I can't help but think the EC of 1978/79 would hate this piece by the EC of '91."
5,BETTER THAN I THOUGHT,This book was absoutely more than i expected. I was so hurt when Jerome's wife was injured in an accident. The love that they had shared since childhood was so real and pure and believeable. I was even more happy with the outcome of Jerome's life and the maturity that he recieved when the love of his life was injured in that wreck. All of the characters moved you! I was especially enthused to hear more about the Naylor girls because I wondered what there outcome would be after the funeral! But even more so I was excited to see Jerome's faith increase in GOD. That in this book it shows that it pays to have faith in GOD. I am impressed with the writings of Ms. Ebony Satin and look forward to many more publications
2,Boring & Pointless,"This book was about an all colored firefighter shift who experience some racist guy sabatoging and doing racist stuff to them. It is also about their lives. I mostly did not like the way the author describes Nicole and Jerome. He describes them as having 3 kids, a house with a white picket fence and a dog. How so very trite!!Nothing really interesting happened in the book. It was kinda boring and left me wondering what the point was."
4,Good Read,"I LOVE JEROME WINTERS!!!! This book is an awesome story centered around a group of LA firefighters. With professional and personal traumatic situations affecting them all, the author shows us how prayer, will and determination can get you through anything. I would have liked to see Andrew's character involved a little more. I think the author's focus on Jerome and Nicole took his place. I even asked myself were he was. He sorta dropped off. Other than that, it still a great read."
5,This Book Was On Fire !!!!!!!!!!,This is a book that every avid AA reader should have on their bookshelf.This book made me go through all different types of emotions. The relationship between Nicolle and Jerome was a beautiful one that was definitely joined by GOD. They reminded me of my husband and I. I really felt like these characters were real. I felt like I was lost and also EbonySatin taught me a few things about firefighters that you never really think about. Like for one they are not fighting three alarm fires all the time but are mostly taking car accident calls as well as health calls. Even though I work in health care I never really thought about it. I learned other very important facts and history as well. But GO BUY THIS BOOK AND SEE WHAT PARRY BROWN IS UP TO.....I see why Parry Brown is a motivational speaker because she has motivated me with each book that she has written.
4,incredibly fun book with an incredibly annoying character,"Tyler is the type of guy that most people want nothing to do with, yet Autobiography of a Narcissist is so funny and well written that you find yourself actually caring what happens next. Jonathan Foster has created such a real voice for Tyler that I find myself thinking that maybe I would find the author as annoying as the book's main character (that is a compliment to the author by the way).This is the kind of book you want to have if you're home sick in bed or have a long plane trip ahead of you. It makes you laugh and it keeps you entertained, even as you're wondering why in the world you are still reading about this guy who is so self-absorbed you just want to whack him upside the head."
2,Painful,This version is painfully slow. I have never complained about a software product's performance before buying this version. Last year's version is fine; stick with it until Intuit addresses this problem. The new version changes the file format thus you can't go back after the conversion.
5,Ms. Tron rulz,"this game rocks,awesome Graphics,just alitttle kiddie,but its fun.when the little yellow robots get lazy,its time to teach them a lesson,put them in your torcher chamber.heh heh funny stuff,and when you in your robot destroying everything your little helpers the yellow robots they go and steal stuff."
5,The Misadventures of Tron Bonne,"I found this game to have a challenging set up and fun storyline. It interests me because it is an action RPG game, but it also gives you puzzles that have taken me hours to solve. I have to honestly rate it five stars. Now if only I could remove an enourmouse scratch from it that is preventing me from facing the finall boss."
5,This game Rocks!,"I love this game! All the levels are so fun, and the little servbots are so cool! It's so fun when you make them steal the tires off cars! All the different types of gameplay, from puzze to action, with some RPG, Tron Bonne is an excellent way to pass the time. I give it a 5."
5,What A Treat !,"What a treat, This is actually alot different than megaman Legends..This game Is a real blast. If you are into Megaman titles like myself you will love this game.Great story, control and graphics.It also comes with a megaman 2 demo cd which I just played and that looks awesome too. I am gonna buy mega man 2 tomorrow.I am a big fan of capcom games...No need to rent this if you are interested just buy it you will love it. I gurantee it I am george zimmer, LOL just kidding..Have fun ...."
1,"Gear noise is annoying. Constantly tick, tick, tick, tick,..","Unless you plan on putting this vcr into a soundproof chamber, do not buy it. There is a constant clicking caused by internal gears that drive the mechanism within the machine. Trust me, once you hear it either while playing or recording a tape, it will drive you nuts, much like chinese water torture (for you youngsters, that is the sound of one drop of water hitting your forehead, than another, and another and another. I can't believe that toshiba would allow such a product to come with their name on it"
2,"Silly, Inconvenient trick needed to record shows!","This is so silly -- most VCRs, you turn off the VCR, and it records the shows you have entered. But not this Toshiba! Instead, you must use the remote control and press two ""TIMER"" buttons at the same time in order to get your shows recorded. If you forget, and simply push the POWER button -- sorry, no shows get recorded. Just plain stupid!Note: No VCR-Plus either. Price is nice though."
2,Not Sure,Right after I stopped using ink from my printer's manufacturer (Brother) I started having a lot of paper jams and other issues. Was it the ink? No idea. But what I saved on the ink wasn't worth the pain in the neck. Get on a plan with Brother or Staples so you get a free one after X returned cartridges. Better deal.
3,Not up to Expectations,"Following in the wake of The Poet and Blood Work, I expected another great book, but came away disappointed. Void Moon lacked the narrative drive found in the other two books and the characters just weren't as compelling. Still, it's a good read, although not up to Connelly's usual standards."
5,Void Moon,Excellent book that illustrates how our base nature always comes to the fore when in a pinch.
2,disappointed,I had high hopes for a non-Bosch installment but this one is to be saved for last once Bosch fans have covered the entire Bosch series. A convict out on parole decides life is not exciting enough so she wants to get back in the game. I couldn't get into this story whatsoever but others may enjoy it.
5,Void Moon A Good Read,This was not Michael Connelly's typical book. The hero in this book is a convict out on parole. The story line has many twists and turns. What you think is obvious in the beginning is proved to be unfounded in the end. Connelly did a marvelous job developing the characters. The story line captures your attention from the get-go and never lets go.
4,High tech thriller- as satisfying as a good cheeseburger!,"I won't belabor that all the ""heroes"" of Void Moon are theives or worse, what's terrific is that Connelly has made them likeable, fascinating, and complex. There's nothing to fault -the pacing, action, high tech details, compelling ambience, and great characters make for a slick, terrifically fun read. No redeeming morality here, but masterful plotting that's hard to put down."
4,Great storytelling!,"This is my first novel that I've read by Michael Connelly and it won't be my last. Fast paced, full of action, as I was reading it I could see it as a movie and it would be a kicking movie too! It did remind me of the movie, ""Long Kiss Goodnight"" slightly. Cassidy Black is our heroine and she is currently on parole. She ends up being lured back into business by an old accomplice who swears it's an easy target. Cassie ends up back in Vegas where her last job went bad; it ended up with her lover being thrown out a window on the top floor of the Cleopatra hotel. The new job takes her back to that scene. The job goes well, but the mark has too much money, about 2 million more than expected. From there this novel is on a roller coaster. Just try to hang on to the end, it's a fantastic ride!"
2,Not Connelly's best,"If you're a Michael Connelly fan, Void Moon will be a real disappointment. Although the plot moves along at a fast pace, the characters are one dimensional and the story reads like a movie of the week. It's all very predictable with no real surprises."
4,Sophisticated Burglar,"Fairly choppy in the beginning, Void Moon unfolds into a spell-binding story about a state-of-the-art cat burglar who constantly surprises and captivates the reader. Held my interest through the last page."
1,WORST OF THE BEST,"I HAVE ENJOYED READING MICHAEL CONNELLY'S EIGHT PREVIOUS BOOKS.BUT THIS BOOK WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF THE PAPER IT WAS PRINTED ON .I HAVE COME TO EXPECT A MUCH BETTER LEVEL OF WRITING FROM MICHAEL CONNELLY.HIS OTHER BOOKS TRANSPORTED THE READER INTO THE WORLD OF HIS CHARACTER'S.I DO HOPE HIS NEW BOOK ""A DARKNESS MORE THAN NIGHT "" IS AN IMPROVEMENT."
1,Waste of Time,"I have read all of Connelly's books and was anxiously awaiting Void Moon. All of the characters were cliches and unlikable. The plot was thin at best and extremely predictable. Reading Void Moon was a disappointment and a waste of time. It is not reasonable to expect all of an author's to be terrific, however they should at least be worthwhile. Save your money - skip it."
3,Sinful Suspense,"Michael Connelly was pretty much right to set most of this story in Las Vegas, where anything goes. As with many books that I've read, I'm hooked at some parts of the book, while I'm wishing for the chapter to end at others. However, the final chapters are indeed gripping, and I now am aware of how some forms of organized crime are executed. The activities done in this story are things that I most likely an unable to do. Cassie is definitely a woman with attitude. I've never read any of the Bosch books, but after reading this, I just might."
2,"light stuff, but fast reading","This looked like some decent beach reading material so I took it with me on my Hawaiian vacation. Read about half on the plane and finished the rest a few days into my trip. In short, worthy beach reading. The protagonist is Cassie Black, a ""hot prowl"" thief, recently out of a 5-year jail stretch. She needs money and takes another job, ripping off a money man staying at a Las Vegas casino. Soon she has a psychopath tracking her down and killing people along the way. Not a whole lot of character development going on, but the story moves fast and holds your interest until the end. Fun book, very light reading, but I'd still like something a bit more substantial next time. (Even for a beach read). (23 APRIL 2001)"
4,More memorable characters that shouldn't be overlooked!,"How do you capitalize on your previous job experience? You write about it!Michael Connelly books have mesmerized readers with his working knowledgeof the California Law Enforcement community. Not even some of his main charactersare saved from the evil that lurks there. My thoguht is: If once you delve into his world of characters, and you don't find yourself fully engaged, you might want to check your sanity."
3,Worth Reading But Not One Of Connelly's Best,"Void Moon is a fast-paced, entertaining thriller that will hold your attention. However,in comparing Void Moon to Connelly's other non-Bosch thrillers-- The Poet and Blood Works--Void Moon is not as good. Comparatively, it does not measure up on the extent of surprises, believability, and depth of character development (although Cassie Black and Jack Karch ARE interesting characters). If Void Moon is your first book by Connelly you might give it a higher rating than the '3' I gave it (which I actually would have rated a '3 1/2' if Amazon had such a rating), but it's hard for me to evaluate this book without comparing it to The Poet and Blood Works, which I would highly recommend. Keep in mind, that a '3' (or a '3 1/2') is a good rating and, as I said, Void Moon is worth reading."
3,"""ONLY FAIR""","I usually really enjoy a Michael Connelly book, however, this one was only fair. I nearly quit reading the book several times in the first 100 or so pages, but I kept on thinking it had to get better. Thank goodness it did.Cassie Black is a n ex-con who is returning to her old ways. This time she again runs into Jack Karch who was around when her old boy friend, Max, was killed. Jack is a case by him self. HE is about as sorry as they come. There is several dollars involved, a little girl and lots of killing. The boss of the casino, Victor Grimaldi, is another villan. Cassie goes through lots of, over by head, wireing tricks and crawling through air ducts to get the job done. A little to much for me. Give me a good Harry Bosch anytime."
3,disappointing,"Had Michael Connelly written this under a psuedonym I would have rated this higher because its a good book but Connelly usually writes great books. The characters did not engender sympathy, the plot was run of the mill and I found reading the book hard going - something I have never encountered with any of his other books. Hope the next one is better"
3,great book til the end,"I love Connelly's books. I envy his success. I loved this book, but as in other of his novels he once again demonstrates a willingness to take a highly appealing story and set of characters and have them engage in all sorts of bizarre plot twists to pull it all together. I almost expect him to eventually write: ""And then a spaceship came down from Mars and killed everyone. The End."" It must be hard to outdo your own success. Like Carl Hiassen, who seems to keep writing the same book, Connelly has trouble coming up with solid plot lines. The stories are absorbing and engaging until you can almost hear him say, ""Oh My God, I've got to end this and tie it all together."" As a reader, you feel offended. You've been taken for a ride, but with Connelly, at least the ride is a lot of fun until the horse throws you off at the end and you feel as if you've been had again."
3,Disappointing,"This was my 7th Connelly book, and first I found disappointing. It was difficult to finish, and lacked the magic of his other books."
5,I enjoyed this book very much,"This was the first book by Michael Connelly that I read, outside of his Harry Bosch series. In my opinion, it is one of his best."
4,Good charcter and great scenery,A great standalone book by Michael Connelly. Surprisingly strong character casting with superb interplay between the characters. Great theme and plot that moves at a good nip. Superb scenery drawn of action and atmosphere in Las Vegas casinos. Nice ending. Really liked it.
3,TOO TECHNICAL,"The characters were not developed, way too much detail on breaking in and tools used. Found myself skimming the tedious parts which were very often. Bad guys get punished, bad girls get? Got bored with ""Max"".Three stars is a gift but I did finish the book."
4,Void Moon is a jolting ride taking the reader along willingly.,"Void Moon is an unusual story about an atypical heroine racing to make up for past failures. Well written, enjoyable to read and unrelenting in pace, Void Moon makes a worthwhile summer read."
5,Michael Connelly -- Better than Ever,"I read Void Moon as soon as it was published. I have been a big fan since his first novel. This thriller does not disappoint, and I wasn't surprised it was optioned by a studio. The protagonist is what we would label a less-than-reformed criminal who's less sorry than just plain sorry she got caught. Yet we grow to care about her and appreciate her pain. Connelly has always been able to elevate his thrillers with his gift of establishing great characters, and Void Moon soars!"
2,Nowhere near as good as his other books -- skip this one,The title pretty much says it all. I should mention that a friend of mine who also reads Connelly LOVED this book.
2,Un-original and predictable.,"I normally like Connelly but 'Void Moon' reads like the screenplay for a TNT movie of the week.Nothing surprises, the dialogue is cliched, the characters we have seen hundreds of times before, the plot senseless.Guess he was under a publishing deadline when he scribbled this one out."
5,"M.C. only proved himself a better, more dimensional writer","Just loved and enjoyed it---AGAIN! Mr. Connelly is such great and rare talented writer. Like Thomas Perry but John Grisham unlike, none of his creations so far left any bad taste after you left his art gallery. I'd like to encourage Mr. Connelly, the great artist to try any dimension and field other than the ""Harry Bosch"" series (but never phase it out, please). Since you are such a wonderful storyteller, just tell us whatever you consider it an urge to let out and we would listen(read). Life is short, yet having several great writers to keep it at least enjoyable is a bless. Keep healthy and maintain a long, long good writing life, Michael! We are counting on you, Sir!"
4,Entertaining,"This latest work by Michael Connelly has kept me interested for about a week. I found it quite entertaining and was never bored. My only complaint is that I did not feel sympathy for any of the characters. Every one here is dirty, compared to the characters of Connelly's Harry Bosch series where the reader roots for Harry. Connelly deftly weaves a Los Angeles plot with one in Las Vegas. He also reveals an evil character in his creation of Jack Karch. I know comparisons are cheap, but I see this as a bit of an Elmore Leonard tribute book. The themes of an ex-con making one more score reminds me of Riding the Rap or Out of Sight. If you enjoy a good mystery that incorporates cultural references, especially Los Angeles, pick up this one or any of Connelly's other excellent books. I have read all of his books but Black Ice and have yet to find a dud. Thank you, Mr. Connelly."
2,Where's Harry?,"Being a Michael Connelly fan I was eager to read this book. Being a Harry Bosch fan I could hardly wait for this book to come to print. I was very disappointed. Non of the characters in this book are likeable and I had no sympathy for any of them. Poor characters, predictable plot; not the makings of a good book. I'll wait for Harry's return!"
3,Eat Your Vegetables,"I finished this in one day, but I'm sorry I did. (My parents always made me eat my vegetables, so I would hurry to finish them in order to get on with the good stuff.) This was my first Michael Connelly. I bought it as a gift for my Significant Other, who read it and might rank it higher than I do. I felt the plot had quite a few logical holes and an explanation of the villain's motivation at the end of the book that was more like daytime soap operas than I care to read in an adult thriller. This guy writes pretty good descriptive narrative, but the characters lack the dimension one finds in, say, Elmore Leonard. It will probably make an entertaining and forgettable movie."
2,disappointing effort from a very good writer,"I have read all of Connelly's books, but this is not one of his best. Anyone who wants to read one of his best should start with ""The Poet"" or ""The Last Coyote""."
2,None,very disappointing. i forced myself to read it thinking its a Connelly book...its got to be good. it didnt pick up speed until half way thru. soory but a waste of money and time for me.
3,Eat Your Vegetables,"I finished this in one day, but I'm sorry I did. (My parents always made me eat my vegetables, so I would hurry to finish them in order to get on with the good stuff.) This was my first Michael Connelly. I bought it as a gift for my Significant Other, who read it and might rank it higher than I do. I felt the plot had quite a few logical holes (which I won't go into because I don't want to spoil it) and an explanation of the villain's motivation at the end of the book that was more like daytime soap operas than I care to read in an adult thriller. This guy writes pretty good descriptive narrative, but the characters lack the dimension one finds in, say, Elmore Leonard. It will probably make an entertaining and forgettable movie."
4,The action hurtles along at breakneck speed,"Who cares if the protagonist is a thief! This a work of fiction. Get over it. I read to be entertained and this book did just that. The pace was unrelenting.Cassie Black is back in the life of ripping off high rollers in Vegas one time so she can get the money she needs to go on the run after she kidnaps the daughter she delivered in prison from the girl's adoptive parents. OK, it's not really that dumb, but in one sentence, what do you expect? Cassie's problem is that her mark was a bagman for a payoff to get the license approved to get the casino sold to some undesirable buyers. The casino puts PI Jack Karch on the trail of the money and he leaves a trail of bodies in the wake as he pursues Cassie."
2,Connelly's weakest book,"This was unfortunately Connelly's weakest book thus far. The idea is very good, but there's simply not enough style in the execution. It's really too bad...there's too much attention to technical detail, but the characters are more sketched than ever...I think he could have benefited from a female co-writer here."
1,Didn't even finish this one,"I've read about 8 or 10 Connelly books and have liked them. For me, Michael Connelly is someone I can grab off a shelf and be sure I'll enjoy it. Not this one, though. After 120 pages of very detailed writing of a woman getting back into her criminal ways - how to set up the scam she will commit - I gave up on this one. The beginning shows how bored she is while trying to live the straight and narrow and the writing is, well, boring. I guess that was the point, but come on!I won't give up on his books because this one wasn't to my liking."
5,Sultry and Inexplicable,"One of the more effective gay themed movies I have seen in a while. The acting in many gay movies is atrocious, so I was pleased with Derek Magyar's performance. The character he plays is sultry because he is so guarded almost to the point of being completely unreachable. The in-depth interaction between the four leads is most inexplicable and must be seen to be truly appreciated."
3,A recommended read for horror story fans.,"I bought this as a library copy. I'm pretty sure that I read it before but it didn't stick in my memory. It makes for a decent read. I was able to lose myself in it and that counts for a lot. The back cover makes it come across as a crime novel. You are told of the 1930s when countless bodies keep turning up in Cleveland, Ohio. You are tossed the name of Eliot Ness and even a defiant police officer. One named, Stefan Ryzard. That is only the surface of the story. A read for horror fans. The more so for fans of stories of bloodless bodies. If you are such a fan then you know of what I speak.Leann Arndt, Reviewer"
2,"Pretty earrings, poor design","These are very pretty earrings, but the box chain is so thin and smooth that the earrings won't stay in place. They were literally sliding back out of my ear lobes the moment I put them in. I bought these to wear at my wedding and they'd be perfect except for this major flaw. I'm going to buy some of those little rubber earring stoppers and give them a trial run that way, but sadly, I wouldn't recommend them based on this design flaw. The manufacturer must be aware that their design doesn't work. Why they wouldn't add a length of chain in the center that would hold well or at least ship these with rubber earring stoppers is beyond me."
2,unable to rate product,"order product as a replacement for Visonic MCT 234 wireless remote fob. Could not get replacement fob to sych with my unit, even with the help of tech support. Able to get a refund after numerous emails to company..."
3,Fair price; decent reliability.,"These are very convenient for my security system. The buttons do wear out after a year or two, making them an expensive maintenance item. I can arm and disarm the system from in my car, about 150 feet from the base, with good reliability. They are code-secure. You can buy them from Smarthome.com also, for a little more, and not free shipping!"
5,Works as it should.,"If you are looking for this and don't have one for your alarm system you need one. Just like a car keyfob, arm, disarm etc. I purchased to replace a keypad that stopped working after too many drops. I have 3 total now, and two are over two years old on the same batteries."
1,Bad Shipping Again,"I'm leaving town now... Where's my item? This is a real bummer for me. I needed this item, and it was supposed to be here."
5,Zoologic Reviewed,Excellent game requiring logic and patience and which is also fun for children. There are plenty of levels to extend all ages. Levels and levels that indeed test the ability of grown-ups.
2,"It is a good bag, BUT there are much better ones.","If you love flexi-leashes, you simply HAVE TO GET THIS KIND OF BAG. You will love the convenience.I had to purchase a new one after my sweet pit mistook the attached bag as a chew toy and obliterated it.THIS BRAND IS NOT VERY GOOD.Instead, BUY THE 'OUTWARD HOUND' BRAND virtually identical product because:1. The zippers are totally flimsy and cheap on the flexi brand compared to Outward Hound.2. The nylon used for the bag is really thin, cheap and does not hold it shape and form as well as the very thick and durable Outward Hound brand.3. If you like multiple pocket options, the again the Outward Hound has both the regular zipper pouches as well as net like outer quick slip in/out spots."
4,Worth the money,"The material is pretty thin & the zippers are probably not the strongest... BUT, this is worth a $5 investment. A lot more convenient than the 'poop bag' attachments, & more pockets for your keys, cell phone, etc. This attaches w/ elastic bands, so it is probably not going to last forever, but as long as you're not abusing the product it will probably last for a couple years. Overall, I am very satisfied with this. One issue I do have is that the product description on Amazon just says 'fits MOST flexi leashes', but doesn't specify which ones it doesn't fit. I have a 'large' flexi leash for big dogs, it fits fine. On the packaging it says that this bag won't fit the 'mini' or 'giant' leashes, FYI."
2,Wrong item advertised,"I used one of these when I watched a friend's dog and they are a great idea. However, this write up says that the item fits most sizes of flexi leashes. When the item arrives it clearly says that it only fits the large and one other size, but not the small and other sizes. I had a small. Sure enough, it didn't fit so back it went. So, great product, delivery, and refund process - but watch the size."
3,"Okay, but not made well.","Great idea, but poorly made. After regular use for 2 weeks, one of the seams is already coming apart. This is a bummer because it's the only type of product with this design. The design is nice, but it's just cheaply made."
3,Not for small Flexis!,"Cool product, was very much looking forward to using it. However, it does not fit the small Flexi leads. I thought perhaps I had missed this in the description, but it only says ""fits most Flexis""- not very specific! Would be a handy product, if I had a medium or large Flexi."
3,"Very Useful, kinda cheaply made...","This bag is very convenient for holding poop bags and treats and other stuff. It does fit a medium flexi leash (for dogs up to 44lbs), but just be warned that it is not a GREAT fit. I think this was more designed for the large flexi leashes, since it just kind of hangs off the medium. This would definitely be WAY too big for a small flexi leash. The fabric has also torn on the bag a little bit, and I've only had the bag for about 3 weeks. Overall, not too bad, but you get what you pay for."
5,flexileash accessory bag,"This is my second accessory bag. I originally purchased it in a pet supply store, but couldn't find it locally. It has 2 large pockets for bags or balls and a side pocket for key or other small objects. My last one held up seven years and could have been repaired. The front elastic strap finally wore out. It's extremely handy. In a pinch I can put my phone or music player in there also (although I consider this risky. I use it on a compact leash for our dachshunds although it doesn't fit perfectly it's fine."
5,Cool Lil holder..,It's works but the elastic strip on top slides down and covers the leash pullout and it needs a better stitch in spots but for 5 bucks it arrived on time and I don't carry the slobber ball with two fingers anymore.. Worth it to me...
4,flexi leach bag,"Not as well made as Rufus and Coco leash , however, they will do they job, but not as well made. When comparing the Rufus and CoCo the material used is not as durable, but then again, they are less expensive than the Rufus and Coco leash bags. You get what you pay for."
2,Does NOT fit Flexi large-breed leashes,"When I bought the leash accessory bag, I was led by the description to believe that it fits all Flexi retractable leashes. Not true. I recently replaced my regular-sized Flexi leash because it was damaged by sand. It was made for smaller breeds, but worked just fine with my 80-lb. black lab. I decided to go with the Flexi leash made for his size breed because it was well-priced. Unfortunately, the accessory bag's elastic bands that secure the bag to the leash hardware do not expand enough to fit my leash. While I can get it to stay put, the elastic is fully stretched and inconveniently spans the opening for the leash. Consequently, the in-and-out motion of the leash tape is chafing the elastic holding the bag in place, which means it will not last very long. Do not buy this item for the larger leashes. It should be just fine for the smaller leashes."
3,Good concert,"Good concert, but better to check titles before you buy. Some titles may not familiar ..."
1,A poor saw,"Even given the price this saw did not measure up. Trouble with straight lines, the pop up for scrollong was difficult to use on the fly and sometimes just did not work. All in all, a very poor quality saw."
2,Not the best jigsaw,"I picked up this jigsaw because of the relatively low price and because my father has a B&D jigsaw that has never given him any problems. I also liked the quick clamp blade system.For light work around my house the saw does an adequate job. However, as soon as I cut anything tougher than 3/4 inch particle board I notice the blade wandering. At first, I thought I was feeding the saw too fast but even when creeping through the material (pine 1x6 as well as a 1 3/8 inch solid core door) the blade still wanders.Additionally, the dust blower/extractor doesn't work very well.Finally, this little saw really gives you a workout from all of the vibration that it produces.If you only need a light duty jigsaw and don't want to spend a bunch of money, this saw will work for you. If you will be cutting tougher stock, I would recommend spending the extra money and going with a higher end saw (personally, I have my eye on the new Bosch jigsaw, as 6.4 amps should cut through anything)."
3,Shook a lot but did the job.,"Just bought this saw today to help round some plyboard edges. By the 4th corner I had it perfected...but the saw still shook a lot. I had it cranked on 6 so maybe that's why (I like the variable speed feature). Quick blade insertion mechanism was fantastic and I did not have the blade pop out even once. I tried to use the included tool to cut some straight 1 inch cuts but I couldn't keep the screw tight enough to maintain the 1 inch margin... B&D;, good idea but you need some other way to secure this (even torque with a wrench didn't help). I didn't attempt using it for the circular cuts, just used a compass instead which did the job.Nicely removes dust as you saw, although my vacuum cleaner didn't fit onto the contraption that blows the dust out the back (good idea though). I'm happy with the saw and the soft-cover case for the price I paid."

1,Strong chemical odor.,"I did not read the other reviews before ordering this. It sounds great, but the product has a HORRIBLE chemical smell. I washed it several times, but it would not go away. The teether has now been laying around my house to be returned for literally five months and it still smells. I cannot give it to my baby to chew on and would strongly discourage anyone from buying it."
1,Unusable- terrible smell,My baby initially chewed on this and after a few minutes she dropped it. I gave it back to her and she would not put it in her mouth. I tried it and realized that there is a terrible chemical odor. It is not dishwasher safe or able to be boiled. I worry about the chemicals baby would be ingesting. It will be picked up by the garbagemen this week.
3,Munchkin Teether,I ordered this because my son constantly sucks/bits his fists. Idea is clever but it didn't work well for my son. The Munchin teether resembles nipples so my son won't chew on the teether he only sucks on it.
2,"Too Heavy, Smells, not easy to clean","My nine-month-old is not interested in this toy. I think it is because it smells like plastic. It must taste like plastic to him too. Who wants the taste of plastic in their mouth?!! Also it is a bit heavy. If he is lying down while playing with it and he drops it, it falls on his face. Ouch! He only tried that once. I'm disappointed because I thought he would like the shape and be able to reach his back gums with it. Also, it CANNOT be immersed in water to clean. You'll get water inside if you do. Think: Mold. Yech! What kind of a teething toy is it when you can't get it completely clean!!?? The only positive things I have to say about it are: It is a good size. The rattle is a mild sound and the twisty noise is nice. I liked the colors too. But I would not recommend buying it. This toy is a design flop."
2,This product stunk!!!,This product literally stunk. I don't know what else they stored in that warehouse but it had a very chemical smell. Once I was able to get the smell out( took a while) my son loves this toy.
3,It's Okay,"My son is teething and chewing on everything. So I bought this one day hoping he'd just love it. I personally liked everything about it, all the textures and the clicking sound. But my son just didn't care. He doesn't find it interesting at all. Bummer, I still think it's great though."
3,Depends on your child,My son only likes this toy a few minutes at a time. He isn't really into playing with it to much. He chews on it a bit then throws it away. But it might just be his preference
3,ummm,"it is a a toy, however my daughter is 8 months and does not seem interested in the toy at all it arrived on time but just to me not a great teether"
3,A little bulky,Got this as a gift for my baby. She is 6 months and hasn't taken much interest in it yet. It is a bit heavy and bulky to put in her mouth. Maybe she will like it more down the road. The colors are pretty and it makes a nice clicking noise when you turn it.
2,smells terrible!,"this toy smells aweful! i cleaned it couple times, but the smell still stays, in fact - every time i clean it with water (with a little soap or without) it smell worse. finally i just decided to wash it under water really well, thinking it might help - nope, the smell is still there.my son loves the noise it makes when you swist it though, so that's the only way we use it."
1,"Too heavy, smells awful, tastes horrible.","We got this from Target and it looked great. When we gave it to our daughter she immediately got excited and put it in her mouth. Unfortunately she then immediately started spitting and had this horrible look on her face. We tried a few more times and each time she wanted to chew on it but quickly spat it back out. My wife then noticed an awful chemical smell coming from this. We tried washing it repeatedly and still that smell. I tried biting it myself as well and the taste was unbearable. No wonder my child won't put it in her mouth, and she chews on everything. I'm not sure how to clean this so it doesn't taste so bad so it looks like it's headed to the trash soon."
2,Questionable odor,"Fantastic design. Unfortunately, it smells like old, old cigarettes or something like that. I can't imagine a baby tolerating the smell for long. I'm going to scrub it with lemon and hot water and see if it fades. Not very reassuring, though."
2,Mediocre teether,"The teether came in a timely manner. But it wasn't an effective teether as I thought it would be. My 10-month old son would hold it and turn it in his hands for a few minutes, but would never use it as a teether. Oh well, it is an itneresting toy, but it wasn't an effective teether as I thought it could be."
3,An ok toy,"This is a pretty sturdy little teether ball. Our gilr liked it ok as a toy, but I don't think she was really interested in teething on it, and it's not a favorite or anything. My dog was carrying it around once and it didn't show any teeth marks or anything from him, so it is pretty durable."
1,WARNING: Smells Like Toxic Phthalates,"This is labeled as ""non-toxic"", but it sure smells toxic to me. I'm not risking giving this to my baby."
2,Wash this first!,"This teether smelled HORRIBLE when it arrived. A combination of new plastic and something else I can't identify. I had to wash it several times before giving it to my niece. She loved it once she got it, but wow. That SMELL!"
4,Love all the textures.,"My 4 month old son is teething. He is cutting his first teeth which are always the hardest. He enjoys chewing on this ball. He is not yet old enough to twist the ball, but my 2 year old loves this ball as well. Overall this ball is a great buy especially for how inexpensive it was. I plan to buy my 2 year old her own even though she is no longer teething because it is fun to twist and it makes noise and she enjoys throwing it and watching it bounce around because of all the nubs."
5,My son's favorite.,"My fifteen-month-old has latched onto this teether as his security object, so it goes everywhere with us (we've named it ""Sputnik""). Very handy, now that he has molars coming in. It was a hand-me-down, so I was relieved to find it on sale here just in case we ever need a spare!He likes the sound, but even adults find it hard to resist playing with it, --there's something very satisfying about the ratcheting noise when you twist it."
1,Why can't I get the color I ordered?,"Just can't figure out why you would let me pick the pink/yellow toy and then feel free to change it to blue/green. Come on!!! We have four older grandsons and finally have a granddaughter. Of course, I would order the pink toy!!!!!?????"
1,poor quality,"I was only able to print about 5 or 6 pictures, before the color on the pictures was very BAD. I know now that I well only buy a true Canon cartridge.What a waste of my money...."
5,Good Technical Reference,"As I instruct in the technical rescue field, this book is a great reference. Lots of information on ropes, mechanical advantage systems, rope rescue and litters. There is also a bunch of information on confined space rescue in particular, like ventilation and air supply."
4,Confined Space and structural rope Rescue by Micheal Roop,"As a High Structure Rescue Traininer I see a lot of information on roped rescue. I found this book useful and concise with clear illustrations, I don't agree with ever aspect of the rigging, but the authors share the view that there is more than one system for rescue, as long as it is SAFE for everybody. Overall I found it a good book for developing peoples understanding for safe High Structure Rescues."
2,There are better books out there,I was hoping there was gonna be more up to date info then what this book has to offer. Look for something better.
4,"Good overview, well-written, and occasionally humorous","Grim topic well-treated, with occasional flashes of dark humor. The book works not only as an in-depth look at fundamentalist terror, but also as a travelogue. This is where the humor comes in. I found myself laughing, out loud, at Bergan's dry wit when he describes virtuous inanities of travel in some pretty horrible places. It is rare for me to laugh while reading, and in this case, it's a healthy break, because the book depicts some pretty nasty situations and characters."
5,This Was Good....But Bin Laden's Mistress,"This book had a lot of technical stuff, but I still really enjoyed it.I'm more excited by the new book by Osama Bin Laden's mistress, Kola Boof--""Diary of a Lost Girl"". I've read an advance copy and it was absolutely stunning.I think her portrait of Bin Laden and his inside world should be widely discussed by the Bin Laden experts. She really shows a new side of him and his friends and family. I just found it so fascinating and detailed and marvelously written."
3,For beginners...,"This book is definitely for those new to the subject of militant Muslims. Since the author was reporting on Laden and Al queda long before Sept 11th, he is able to weave together a background/setting for the reader so that they are better able to understand the events that have taken place. But as far as the book explaining ""why they hate us so much?"", I think this book has a superficial answer."
3,Nothing new but a good overniew of Al Queda,"I enjoyed this book, but for me, it didn't shed new light on the issue. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know about Bin Laden and Al Queda. It provides a summary of the basic knowledge and key figures and connections."
4,short but well done,"Peter L. Bergen, CNN's terrorism analyst, examines Osama bin Laden, as well as several of his fellow terrorist cronies, and studies atrocities such as the dual African embassy bombings, the USS Cole; he looks at the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the way bin Laden organized his terror groups, and displays short but fascinating peeks into Pakistan, Yemen, Sudan, and much more.While not a comprehensive study on the subject of middle east terror, Bergen does a very solid job in such a short book, and for such a serious subject, he's also able to inject just the right amount of levity.The one thing that Bergen got wrong, as far as I can tell, is when he writes that bin Laden's buddy Mullah Omar was living in a ""modest house"" in Afghanistan; it appears that wasn't the case at all-- he actually was living quite luxuriously, at the exspense of others. Ah well, can't win 'em all..."
3,"Holy War, Inc.: Inside The Secret World of Osama Bin Laden","An engaging account, and Bergen has sound and persuasive views, but it is really a stretched out magazine article that was rushed into print after September 11 and before it was quite ready. There is no index in the book--you have to go to a web address for it--and no tables or diagrams that would have been very helpful. In fact, there is not much analysis. It's kind of a terrorism travelogue, well told by a brave and enterprising reporter, but still a travelogue."
2,Superficial,"I found it kind of a consumer mass product. If it pretends to be a one-book-on-the subject, it is not, I found it somewhat superficial, kind of a snapshot. It does not elaborate deeply and thoroughly enough. I would have dedicated more pages to the context, the people and recent history of Middle East. Other books on the same topic I would rather read instead are ""Bin Laden: The Man Who Declared War on America"" by Yossef Bodansky, ""Taliban"" by Ahmed Rashid, ""Terrorism and U.S. Foreign Policy"" by Paul R. Pillar and Michael H. Armacost among others."
4,Great Book Alot of information put out,"This book had alot of information about the al-queda and taliban terrorist networks. answeered alot of my questions. and for once tell you the truth on osama bin laden. Is amazing that he use our own weapons against. well most coutry does that anyway. Whoever wants to know mor about our new war on terrorism, this is a must read then."
5,Provoking Portrait of a Disturbed Man,"Bergen's first book on Osama bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda network, this is still an excellent and dependable resource for learning about one of the world's most infamous men. Bergen is a reliable source, and one of the few men in the world to have personally met Bin Laden in very dangerous circumstances. Those wishing to know who Bin Laden is and what he wants would be well-advised to read this accurate, clearly written volume."
3,The TV version renders the book redundant,"Bergen's account is good, if a little rushed. It outlines the history of bin Laden and Al Queda. It's also easy to read and relatively short, compared to some of the other bin Laden biographies. At times I found myself lost in a sea of foreign names, but the storyline was easy to follow.Sadly, Bergen rendered his book largely redundant when he did the National Geographic Explorer Special, also entitled Holy War, Inc. I saw this special when I was half way through the book and found it difficult to finish the book because I'd already seen the movie. If you don't have much time, Id recommend the TV version-in two hours you get the bulk of what the book has to offer."
4,realistic and interesting.,"This book may look boring but after you read the first page, you just can&#65533;t put it down. The author is wonderful in his ability to make this book so feel realistic in ways he describes stories of him being in Afghanistan. The Holy War takes you inside the world of Bin Laden it gives information on how and why the Jihad religion exists today. It also tells who are the real terrorists and why the Middle East people keep terrorizing the U.S. The book has good content and the stories are good, but what was not good was when I read that the Middle East people will keep on practicing Jihad even when their leader is gone. This religion should be forgotten because it just favors one group of people, and says that all other people should be destroyed."
4,UBL has declared war on YOU,"The Washington Post is right - if you're only going to read one book on AQ, this is it. It will impart a better understanding of who these villains are, what their organization does, and the perversion they extol to justify their terror. Not nearly enough Americans appreciate the death sentence UBL wishes to inflict upon them - no matter who or where they are - perhaps after reading this book they will."
3,Good book but outdated,"This book came out in 1996 and unfortunately, its age shows. While OO purists might argue that the content of this book is as relevant as ever, I would disagree. For example, author is an opponent of entity/controller design and feels that it violates good OO design. It could very well be but the train for that argument has long left the station. MVC (or MVP) pattern is de facto standard for number of frameworks today and entity objects are used quite extensively. The book also makes no mention of design patterns even though Gang of 4 classic came out 2 years prior. While not necessarily a drawback, it would be great to see how author feels about different patterns and their use in real world (especially dependency injection since I have a feeling the author might not be a big fan of it).Overall, I think it is a solid book but it would be great to see the same content with a modern treatment."
3,"good vcr, but not a universal remote","This is a very nice machine, with 2 lines in, which helps me manage a system which has outgrown the inputs on my receiver. It also has an extremely fast rewind and fast forward--a definite plus. However the remote is not universal, contrary to the description--and one of reasons I chose this model over another Toshiba with the same features except for that. It will control Toshiba TVs, but that's all. It also only lets you program 6 selections over a month, instead of the 8 which seemed to have become standard."
1,Big disappointment.,"This VCR is very complicated to program to record. It will not record triple digit channels, which was why I bought it. I guess if you only watch videos and don't record it will do okay but if you want to record things forget it!"
1,This isn't even a movie -- don't get burned,"This is some burned out bug eyed guy who reminds me of a florid paranoid schizophrenic hurling loose associations about how ""They"" are going to fake an invasion of Earth. The visual part is someone with a home video type camera showing crudely drawn pictures that look like they were done during crafts class in 1st grade.I had thought that perhaps there would be an interesting if far fetched presentation of how such an invasion might be faked. Nothing of the sort was presented; just paranoid babble followed by non-sequiturs punctuated by knowing glares or glances.This should have been presented for free as a funny study in crackpottery."
4,Will put children to sleep and adults to passion,"This album of nightsongs is a melodic, relaxing mixture of lullabies. Its gentle rhythms and soothing melodies will puts the kids straight to sleep. Unforeseeably, the italian lyrics also ignited some passion in my wife and my relationship. There is something about Rebecca Dru's voice singing Italian -- you'll just have to see for yourself."
4,where can i get a pc version,I never got the game it was the wrong version. I would like the game for my son.
1,Not as cool as you would think...,ReVolt sounds fun...but the graphics are horrible. Gameplay is below average-hard to see where the track is going and difficult to control your car. Major disappointment for a game that has had so much build-up
3,a fantasy,this book mainly deals with the protagnists sexual adventures and contains some elements of incest. in this story the hero is potrayed as having unbound enthuasism for his pleasure and it is generqally an okay story.
5,Thought provoking and engrossing,"I was hesitant to read this. I mean, how interesting can the live of a nun be, right? Salzman does a terrific job of addressing the true nature of faith--faith in anything really. The themes here are outstanding: what is real versus what we believe; how to pick up and carry on in the face of humiliation, failure; what brings someone to the nunnery. It is all just handled so well.This is an interesting book. I am still thinking about it and I finished it a week ago and am a quarter into another book. Lovely job, Salzman does here."
1,A disappointment,"I like Mark Salzman's writing and I was looking forward to reading LYING AWAKE. Having just read it, I feel disappointed. The story and characters never caught hold of my imagination. Salzman presents a nun impassioned with religious feeling who writes of it in poetry. However, when diagnosed and treated for temporal lobe epilepsy, her intense feelings dissipate. Salzman presents us with the paradox of attributing spirituality to a physical disorder. It is a wonderful idea but his book speeds along without developing the characters, place, and issues with the complexity they deserve. A much better book about an impassioned life in a convent and the issues it creates is Ron Hansen's MARIETTE IN ECSTASY. And a provocative look at the relationship of epilepsy to visions and writing is Lauren Slater's book LYING."
3,So much potential to be better AND worse!,"I read this book for a book club. Overall, the group gave it a thumbs down. I liked it more than most because of how the story stirred questions in my head and how it was a nice, smooth, quick read. There was so much potential for the author to dig deeper into characters and plot points; I was left with so many questions that could have been addressed. I guess the upside of that lack of content is that the story was not too long! I could see much potential for the story to go on and wear out the reader. The topics of faith and health and solidarity are so huge. I cannot imagine condensing them so much, but the author managed it, maybe too well."
3,a tad boring,"Being an ex nun myself, I am always interested in nun books. This was a yawner, but it did give remarkable insight into the cloistered life, aboout which I know very little, having been in an active order. It was in this nun's mind all the time. I wondered how a man could have written with such closeness about this experience. I bet he studied the great nun mystics, Little Flower and Theresa of Avila."
4,"Good, but not breathtaking","After reading so many of these glowing reviews, the actual book did not live up to my expectations. Yes, I liked it. Yes, I'd recommend it. But I found the style almost too sparse, and not really fitting for the spiritual subject matter. It seems I learned more of Sister John's spiritual highs and lows from reviews of the book than the book itself. Don't get me wrong: I like sparse writing and understatment as much as the next reader. But in this particular case, I thought a little more description was needed to really convey what was going on in Sister John's head. (Having experienced something similar, I feel the text did not explain it fully.) One other comment: I thought the tone was a little bit too instructive, informative for a novel. That said, the book was very interesting and the ending was wonderful."
5,A thoughtful and economical gem,"This lyrical novel delves into the foundations of fath. While it is about Carmelite nuns, the message is universal: what happens to faith when one's belief system is turned upside down? Unlike some other melodramatic Job-esque stories which delve into personal tragedy, the dilemma here is more subtle, which makes it more profound.It is a brief novel, but the story is rich and layered. Each word and phrase is deliberate, though I hesitate to say that it's a poetic novel. The story's rhythm and language is more analgous to music.This is a beautiful, breathtaking story that will resonate with readers for a long time."
3,I was disappointed,"As one who experiences the same medical condition born by the main character, I felt Salzman's portrayal of it to be flat and lackluster. He almost got there a few times, but though his description of the symptoms experienced by the nun were factually accurate, I don't think he captured or transmitted the ""feeling"" of what it's really like to live with temporal lobe epilepsy, nor the emotional impact. Mark, I wish you would have talked to more people with TLE..."
3,boredom,"The story has great potential, but the character development is slow and the plot drags on without much meaning. I was disappointment because I expected so much more meat!"
2,What a disappointment!,"I have been looking forward to this book for months, after reading Salzman's essay about writing it (published some months ago in the New Yorker). Too bad it is such thin gruel. The story is easily summarized in a single sentence. The characters are undeveloped. The few scenes with character and dialogue are emotionally absent. I found it nothing more than a Christian how-to manual, not a novel at all."
3,Riveting,"Although I initially bought this book for my college course, I was surprised at how interesting this book was. Even for someone not familiar with Catholicism or the Order of the nuns, this book takes a deep look into what many people with or close to any mental problems feel. Is their reality real or caused by a tumor? Were any or all of the saints/prophets suffering from mental problems or where they seeing and hearing the real thing? The best part of this book was its applicability to all religions."
5,So Elegant - It was a Joy to Read,"This beautiful little book is a quick and easy read, and so remarkably written. The author provides a myopic view into the spiritual lives of a small group of nuns. He wonderfully positions their sparse, simple convent life in Los Angeles.I read this book for a book club and didn't greatly identify with the main conflict in the plot. It's the story of a nun who has achieved clarity about the purpose of her life as the result of a medical condition. She struggles in making her decision to have the condition treated or not. However, a couple of the supporting characters are richly developed and the author weaves complimentary sub-plots into the novel that kept me turning the pages. Along with facing her own demons, throughout the story Sister John, the protagonist, is guiding a novice preparing to make her first vows. Their stories are wonderfully juxtaposed and I found myself rooting for Sister Miriam more than Sister John."
2,Very strict compatibilty requirements.,"First of all, if you have any new intel macs Pro Tools will not install. Only Mac OS X version 10.4.7 and lower are compatible. There are many different small print requirement issues with Pro Tools LE. Read every last requirement on the Digidesign support pages before buying this. Digidesign really needs to be better with support for problems."
1,Computer Engineering Degree required!,"A musician is supposed to use this stuff? Yeah, right. How about someone who has been working with computers for the past 18 years and knows their way around Windows very well. Again, forget it! Windows 7 support...NOT EVEN! Web support that makes sense?? HAH! What a bunch of clowns. This stuff should be completely plug and play by now, but they are holding on so tight to their proprietary technologies that Digidesign just can't let go and allow the end user to have a fun musical experience. Instead, we're spending hours and days trying to get this POS up and running. Please wake me when this company arrives in this millennium. Thanks."
4,The important integration of these two OS systems,"This kind of books are important because the regular user always prefer work with windows, but system administrators need something more powerful than windows OS system Servers !"
2,Not very good,"Gardner's first time at penning a Bond novel. A lot of similarities between the villian and the one in Moonraker. Gardner's next book, For Special Services, is a bit better."
3,SMASH TV a winner,"The editorial review by Gamespot above is concise and accurate for the explanations in difficulty of controls for Sprint and 720. Toobin was doable, but the real fun of this pack was Smash TV. If there was no continue choice for SmashTV at end of game, I would never know what the end of the game looks like, because it is very hard to get that far with out the continue choice. However, if you choose not to continue, your challenge will be great in getting there with the given lives per game. I bought this game for SMASH TV, and KLAX was another fun (controllable) game I got out of the bunch. I Was satasfied."
3,Somewhat hard!,"This is a somewhat hard game called Arcade Party Pak. 720 is hard to do any moves on your controller, Super Sprint is hard to steer, Klax is a good puzzle game, but there's no music in that game, Smash TV is a little difficult than Robotron, Rampage is a little blurry than Rampage World Tour, and Toobin' is easy to play. I like to play Super Sprint when i learn how to win it."
5,11 yr. old loves this!,"I am an eleven yr. old boy who likes to build things like legos, cars, etc. I normally wouldn't like a game like this except that you get to build your own amusement park. You get to build everything! It is really fun and when my friend came to spend the week with me we played this game the most!"
5,Thrillville is Educational and Fun!!,I got this game for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loved it. You get to build your own amusement park. It is educational. It helps with money concepts and fine motors skills and memory!! I would highly recommend Thrillville.
3,thrills?,"THrillville is alright!! You have to really sit there and understand what you have to do...and really? building rides is just a matter of ""chosing"" pix of some and placing them in a spot. We must have popped this game in 2x and moved on !"
3,Not Worth The Money,I thought this game was going to be a great game mainly for the multiplayer aspects. There are quite a few mini games on this which is the main reason I bought it. It isn't worth the money though. The mini games are okay but not what they could be. Some are original but most don't give you the options to be fun. My opinion on this item is to wait for a price reduction and then purchase it if you're still interested. I was very disappointed for the price. This game would be a good buy at say $20 but not any more than that.
2,Wariowar and rollercoaster tycoon mix,"I got this for christmas and I didn't like it. I gave it to my two little brothers, and they won't get off of it. If you are under 12 and you like building stuff and mini games, go ahead. If not, you are buying at your own risk. Dont get me wrong, the grafics are good and some of the mini games are fun, but it isnt all what it's cracked up to be. The only fun thing is mini golf, and why spend 40 bucks on that?"
5,Excellent,"This is a great product especially if you hate eating fruit, cause face it kind of takes a lot of time. Okay, primarly if your lazy when it comes to grabbing a real apple. This works in a pinch. And I've been replacing my junky snacks with these strips of good fruit. Great for anyone's lunch not just kids lunch."
5,My kids love these,"These are awesome- healthy yet on the cheaper side. Super sweet- just like a condensed apple. You can kind of taste the larger texture of the apple pieces. It isn't my favorite texture, but my kids don't care! I recommend~"
4,"If You Are Expecting Fruit Leathers, These Are Different","I'm used to eating another brand of fruit leathers. I ordered these because they were a touch cheaper & I was curious how they'd taste in comparison. They are all natural. They are made of whole real fruit. And they are in a convenient little package in which to pitch into one's bag. They are not, repeat not like the other fruit leathers in consistency. These are a little more ""rugged"" in that they are like the even more back to nature version of the other kind of fruit bars. They are less tangy, but still retain a good flavor. The sour apple isn't so sour, but I can't say they are all that bad either. Again, I'm bias because I've enjoyed the other brands for so long. These really are a good product. If you are trying to get your loved ones to eat more fruit conveniently, this is one way to go."
2,Sandpaper storage,This storage box is made of plastic and has enough drawers for sandpaper but the box is very cheap and maybe worth the cost if it was half of the price paid.the drawers do not close completely. Very cheaply made. It does storage sandpaper.Nor worth the cost.
1,Good Idea - Bad Execution,"I have owned one of these for several years and it has been falling apart almost from the start. If you look closely at the picture you will see that the box portion is made up of two plastic halves snapped together. If you put more than a few sheets of sandpaper in each tray, the middle of the box spreads apart along the seams from the weight which allows the trays to come out of their grooves and fall on top of each other. I plan on making a plywood box with grooves for the trays and throwing away the plastic box, but the box should have been made of a lot heavier material and not contain a seam."
4,Good Storage Unit for the price.,This will work fine but I wish the sides were a little stronger. The sides may bow out over time and if that happens the drawers will drop off their shelf supports. I had to be carefull sliding them in and out while loading so they would not drop off there plastic ledges that support them.I did buy a second one.
2,fell apart,"Let me start by saying I have owned this now for a couple of years. When I first got it I could tell it was junk, but after many hours of putting it back together and a tube of superglue it is okay. I realize now I should have just made one, which is what I will do next spring if not before."
3,A cozy village adventure.,"CANAPES FOR THE KITTIES starts rather slowly, but it never drags. This light and easy-to-read cozy reminded me a bit of Christie in the atmosphere it built up. About a third of the way into the book, it turns creepy and more interesting. Good premise, nice structure, likeable characters (mostly mystery writers!) -- and I love the cats! I wasn't too happy with the outcome -- I thought MY theory of who did it would have been more interesting! But still worthwhile for the nice, fun visit to a friendly village of eccentrics. Nicely done. This is my first Babson. Now I'll look for more!"
4,Had I/But Known,"This is a good kitty book. The cats part is good but could have been better. I really like their creative names, especially for a writer. The plot is inventive. The interaction between the characters is creative. However, the plot is a little obvious. I recommend this book, it's a very light read."
2,A manual with more pictures,"Microsoft certified books usually add more content than this one. If you are a Office user, you should try a book with more integration issues covered. This book has very few if none."
4,Led me to Microsoft Certification,"I found the book to provide all of the information necessary to properly create, update and maintain a fantastic looking website. Of course, I've got some graphic design experience, but it sure offers anyone with Microsoft Office experience the opportunity to exploit the internet to its full capabilities!"
3,An Extension of the FrontPage 98 Manual,"I purchased this book hoping it would provide a more in depth view of FronPage, however it seemed that it hardly went further into FrontPage than the manual that it came with. If you want another decription of what is in the software, and a breif explanation of how to do it, this is a good book. The book is a good supliment for beginners but not much content for the advanced users"
5,Really fun mission control set,"I bought this for my nephew last Christmas, and he reaaly enjoyed it, and thought it was really ""cool""!Would recommend to anyone with children who love outer space toys."
4,Teach them young!,"My four year old helped me put this together. However, she mostly disconnected the plastic pieces for me. But her eyes were very wide the entire time we put this little thing guy together. This was the longest she had ever stayed focused on one thing. It took us two days. Spending approx. 1 hour per day on it. When we put everything together and flipped the switch, this thing took off like a scared grasshopper! Very sturdy plastic and VERY easy instructions! I would recommend for any age..."
2,I did most of these in 5th grade,"If you've never done brain teasers in your life, you might enjoy this book. However, having been a subscriber to ""Games"" magazine and worked puzzles and mysteries all my life, I'd heard of almost all of these brain teasers. Not worth your time or money."
5,An excellent edition of Ancrene Wisse,This is an excellent edition of the Ancrene Wisse with helpful notes though the reader should be very familiar with Middle English before purchasing!
2,Westward Ho (2 1/2 Stars),"The older surviving brother of a wagon train ambush, seeks revenge on the leader of the gang responsible for the murder of his parents and the kidnapping of his younger brother. Years later, he is the leader of a group of 'vigilantes' who oppose lawlessness and unknowingly confronts his 'long-loss-brother' who has since learned the tricks-of-the-trade from the outlaws."
3,Early Republic Western Worthy Of Notice.,"Newborn Republic Pictures utilizes the solid directoral ability of Robert Bradbury, and the presence of John Wayne along with Yakima Canutt and his troupe of stuntriders to produce this strongly scripted film of 1860s vigilante efforts to rid the Far West of outlaw bands that were involved in widespread robbery and cattle rustling. Bradbury, whose skill with Westerns dates back to the early silent period, directs and edits with a solid awareness of suspense, building his typically short scenes with sparse and, at times, stilted dialogue and an eye for proper cast placement which makes excellent use of defined personalities such as Wayne, Frank McGlynn Jr., and Glenn Strange, and gives particular value to the hard-riding stunt performers, who are splendid throughout this well-made (and musical) adventure filmed in California's Owens Valley, at the base of the Sierra Nevada."
4,Westward Ho,"I am a John Wayne fan & have over 70 of his movies in my collection. I agree with Mr. Wu's description of the plot. It is one of the better of John Wayne's grade B Republic movies. It is the only movie in which John Wayne ""sang"" & the dubbed in voice is definitely not John Wayne's voice. John Wayne did not want to be a singing cowboy & it allowed others like Gene Autry & Roy Rogers to fill that role. I was pleased that the film was reworked & the DVD had good audio & picture."
5,Fascinating read,"I read this book in two sittings and since then have been pestering everyone I know with the questions it poses.What if Pontius Pilate hadn't crucified Jesus but set him free? The answer is well thought out, feasible and fascinating.Surprises and ""I wish I'd thought of that"" moments at every turn make this very hard to put down.If you're planning a party and want to provide some intellectual stimulation for your post-party down time this is the book for you."
5,Great Book,I think that What If? 2 is a very good book which explores various senarios and speculates what might have been.I definitely reccommend this book to any history lover.
3,Nice premises - disappointing execution,"The premises that are the basis of this book are, for the most part, intriguing. The problem is that the 20-25 pages allowed for each essay simply don't give the writer enough time to fully explore the ramifications of the twist in history that he or she has suggested. Counterfactual history needs more room for development -- much more than the format of the What If? books can allow."
3,Innovative but ...,"The book offers a new light about the necessity to look at historical events as being changeable.But one has to abide by the necessities while commenting about what if's.History can change of course due to objective changes of circumstances but the chaos theory is not the way to look at historical events. The possibility of Lord Halifax assuming premiership instead of Churchill is a possibility in 1940 on paper, but it is unperceivable in real life.Also some brain exercises can be very usefull. Lincoln when declaring the emancipating declaration was in desperate situation contrary to the belief that it was done for the sake of humane reasons. The book falls short of imagination only when it tries to create a different world after the first careful construction of the ""what if situation"". The analysis of the situation and in-depth research of historical events dosen't deserve the abrupt ends they get."
4,"fun, but uneven","This is a fun 'guilty pleasure' for anyone who likes history, but I was surprised at the uneven quality. Some authors clearly gave a lot of thought to their counterfactuals, and plausibly draw Very Large conclusions from Very Small changes (e.g what if an obscure middle-aged Greek named Socrates had died in battle?). conversely, however, some of the counterfactuals wind up drawing Very Small conclusions from Very Large changes (what if Hitler had been brought to trial after WWII? After much hemming and hawing, the author basically concludes, ""not much"")."
3,Hyper Dinos,This game is alright. It is pretty fun and kind of scary but the game has alot of backtracking that gets annoying. Dinos become very smart and mean. This game is fun but just get ready for a couple of hours of boredom before you get to the real action. The puzzles are pretty hard as well. The music is pretty good. This game is decent over-all. Buy if you are looking for something different than zombies chasing you around.
4,Dino Crisis,"Resident Evil fans will love this ie: those who don't mind the fact that there aren't too many things to kill too often.It is very much a 'puzzle' game and I found the challenge of cracking codes etc. quite rewarding,although it would have been a 5 star game had the Dinos' been a bit scarier and had there been more of them.It is however,thoroughly riveting and I'm looking forward to Dino Crisis 2!"
5,Excellent Old School Dino Fun,"This and Turok are my favorite dino games. I replayed it after ordering it on PSN.This particular title is a haunting tale of a four man squad landing on a deserted facility. You'll mainly encounter raptors early on and eventually, you will meet the mighty T-Rex. The game is fast paced, but you are seriously forced to think about your actions because ammo runs out FAST. This feels more like a survival-horror game than action, which I prefer, simply because it's more intricate and less mindlessness. There are also many fun puzzles, I love puzzles in these games because they sharpen your mind. :)You also get to make decisions at certain events and depending on what you choose, a particular path will be opened to you. This gives the game plenty of replay value.It's old school, but I still give it five stars. Graphics are dated by now, but they were breathtaking for their time and are still solid."
2,A Large Disappointment.,"Why Capcom...why! I understand you had very good intentions with this game and it has a great story line and characters but it's no Resident Evil that's for sure.Compared to the Resident Evil games this game has some very disappointing factors in it, such as you can't skip the videos or there is not enough ammo. I also would like to state that near the time this came out Capcom also released Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. The graphics in Dino Crisis aren't near as good as RE3. Why! Not to mention the low ammo and gun choice in the game. A Handgun, a shotgun, and gernade launcher. That's IT! Except for those few things that I mention it is a very enjoyable game and I do recommend Capcom make Dino Crisis 2 with all these suggestions and more. Then it would be one great game."
2,ok,This is ok. It was not the most boring game in the world but it did have a dull moment and it was very complicating you can barley get past the front gate.
2,Dino crisis crisis,"This game is deffinately fun if your a hardcore survival or dinosaur gamer. This game though was to boring, the weapons stunk, there weren't enough dinos, they weren't surprising the puzzles stunk. There were to many and were to confusing. The characters were even more confusing. For example when Regina approaches the half corpse lying there bloody with organs hanging out every orfice on the corpse she reacts by saying That's disgusting in a dumb blond sort of way. There were more puzzles than dinos in exception to the compies which I must say were exceptionally fun to blow away with the shotgun or grenade launcher. There were puzzles than silent hill or resident evil. There was a puzzle for every thing you could do. To open a door , more dang puzzles. The game is quite an odd combination of resident evil and Jurassic Park. If your in the mood for puzzzles or lots of gore try renting it before buying it. Try it yourself."
1,WORST GAME EVER!,At first this game seems cool because of the name. You think that dino crisis has got to be good. Well your wrong! The game has too many cutscenes in it and you can't skip them which really drove me crazy. The dinosaurs are pretty cool but you run out of bullets and they win everytime.The only reason I gave this game one star was because I couldn't go into the negatives. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
5,The real video game of Jurassic Park,"Dino Crisis, a great game and a masterpiece to the gaming industry. I loved the graphics for everything, especially the T-Rex because they were all incredible and very realistic. The story was very impressive as well as the camera angles. Anyone who loves survival horror and dinosaurs must buy this masterpiece."
4,"Great game, though it can be short","Dino Crisis is a great game -- lots of excitement, suspense, and action. It doesn't fail there. I beat it in four days (seven hours playing time), though, so definitely rent it first.Some of the voice acting is weak, but it's not the worst out there. The story will keep you interested, as will the battles with the enemy dinosaurs. An added plus is the decisions you must make at key points in the story, but even this (and the different costumes) isn't enough to give the game the replay value it needs to make it a 5-star game."
4,Go for it!,"This is an excellent game and an excellent filler in between Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3. The drama and grafix are hot! The puzzles are sometimes annoyingly challenging, but overall this game is excellent. It also has multiple endings, just to make it all the more fun."
3,"Decent, but not really worth it","I purchased Dino Crisis as one of my first Play Station games. Although the graphics are pretty well done, it gets old quickly. You are running the character around the station more than anything else. There are very few dinosaurs to shoot, and it is very confusing at first. Honestly, it's more trouble than its worth."
3,Alright...not great...,"This game, as most people agree who played it, is a cross between Jurassic Park and Resident Evil. Unfortunately, it is nowhere near as good. The weapons are decent and the graphics are better than average, but this game is monotonous! There is no way to skip past the long, boring dialogue as with Resident Evil 3. It can be downright painful at times. With the weapons you get, you would figure there would be more dinosaurs, i.e. more action...wrong. This game is about puzzle solving. Big Deal! Don't get me wrong; it has its moments. My advice would be to rent it at your local video store before buying it and find out for yourself. Then you'll know I was right."
4,Great Game!,"While some reviews hail this as a Resident Evil with Dinosaurs it's much more than that. The characters were great,and the story line is awesome. The only complaints I had for this game were the camera angles, some were very infuriating! The game play is solid, and this game is an instant classic. I would recommend picking this game up at the cheap price it is being sold for before it's too late! Fast shipper as well, and prompt service!"
5,Backpack Frame,"I've never had a ""real"" backpack before, just the kind kids use in school. I was surprised at how much I could fit into this backpack and still carry it comfortably on my back. I don't really plan to go hiking, though. I bought it to pack the things I'd need in case I might some day have to suddenly evacuate due to fire, earthquake or some other calamity. I'm pleased with it."
5,"nice looking, solid constructed bag",Bought this for my wife for a 3_day hiking trip. This bag has plenty room for everything she needs and it feels comfortable on her back.Highly recommended if you have short torso length and want to save some comparing to buy a north face.
