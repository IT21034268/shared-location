4,Works wonderfully,This product works wonderfully. I will compare it favorable to the instant nail polish remover from Sephora. My only complaint is that the packaging was not that great. When I received it in the package it was slightly damp that the product had spilled very onto the packaging.This needs to be packed better
2,Good workout for beginners,"I was disappointed with this workout. I have been working out for a long time and would consider myself at the intermediate/advanced level. I bought this DVD after purchasing Hardcore Kickbox Circuit with Janis Saffel. The parts that Guillermo Gomez did on that DVD were great- a much better workout that Janis Saffel's sections and fun and intense. So I thought I would buy this Guillermo Gomez Kickbox Underground.Fist off, the production on this is not very good. But I could have lived with that if the workout was decent. I barely broke a sweat and my heart rate was not much above resting. It's very slow and great for a beginner, but if you want a real and intense workout, look for something else.One thing that Guillermo Gomez is very good at, however, is going through the steps and building each combo. He also works both sides evenly."
2,Average Workout,"Pretty average workout and definitely below the ""intermediate"" workout advertised. I had to put on a 10lb vest and weighted gloves to get a decent sweat. Cueing was off and the production itself appeared badly edited. Gomez has excellent form, nonetheless."
4,Great Workout!,"I work out to DVD's allthe time mand have been through what seems like a ton. Guillermo is a great instructor. I took off one star ust because the production value is not that great BUT this is a great workout. I'm in good shape and I can work up a sweat and high heart rate to this video. If you like kicking, you'll like this video!"
1,This cd is one that doesn't hold my interest,"I have known of Fran Jeffries for some time. I don't believe I have ever heard her sing. For the most part her voice is ok. She sounds like she can sing.The main problem I have with this cd is the repertoire. It didn't have enough of the ""good old songs"", you know, the show stoppers that I truly love to hear. She used Jimmy Haskell to do the arrangements for orchestra. He did a good job.I know it is impossible to please every musical taste, so there will always be some people that are unhappy.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
2,underwhelming,"I have long been a fan of Nicky Epstein and found her first book on the subject of edgings to have useful and ingenious ideas and techniques. Was there really any call for a second book on the topic? I think not, because all this book really does is show you, over and over, that you can make an edging out of most any pattern by knitting a small band of it. As for the enticing knitted rose edging on the cover, Nicky Epstein has a whole book on knitted flowers. I returned this book."
3,Textbook Review,The pages on the left are not printed as good as the pages on the right. This was a required book for a college class so it has all of the important information but not a good quality book.
2,WHERE HAVE ALL THE HORSES GONE??,This book doesn't have anything to do with the main subject!? HORSES!!!!!
3,No practical jokes!?,"This book was good, but, Ms. Bryant, what happened to Lisa and John Brightstar? Also, why did you not continue with little Maxi, Veronica, and Ms. Reg? (not to mention anyone from the Bar None, Deborah, Pony Club rallies, etc...) The worst part was no more practical jokes with Stevie! That is what first attached me to the books 7 yrs. ago. I and my older sister have been fans forever, and, to this day, the books that I have read over and over are the ones with Stevie coming up with some wierd way to punish Veronica for being such a snot! Please keep it that way!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Growing up,"I enjoyed The Saddle Club books when I was younger and I borrowed the first two books in the Pine Hollow series from the library. For some reason the library stopped carrying them and I never got around the reading the rest. All in all, I enjoyed the more mature themes, as I felt like I had grown up with Stevie, Carole and Lisa. I was becoming less horse crazy (yet I still love them) and starting to focus on other things as well. As a side note, the part where Lisa's brother's step-kids from Germany call Americans lazy and that Thanksgiving is just a lame excuse for a day off work... I just want to point out that Germany has between 10 and 13 public holidays a year (not to mention most people have 28 to 30 vacation days). The US has 10. Most Germans find it crazy that Americans don't get as much vacation time and generally view it as a work-a-holic society. Americans definitely need that extra day off in order to stop working, take a deep breath, and be thankful for everything."
3,the trail home,"In this book, Callie is dealing with the aftermath of the car accident that left her crippled. Using therapeutic riding, she's determined to recover fully. Stevie, who was driving at the time, is dealing with feelings of guilt and fear over driving again. Meanwhile, Lisa has a job on a TV-series set in California where she's visitinig her dad and his new family. Carole is trying to get closer to stablehand Ben Marlowe, but he's resisting all her attempts. Book two in the Pine Hollow series."
3,Just like I had as a Kid,Remembered these from back in the days and thought the grandkids would love em too. Made for some great Kodak moments when they got to the FIZZ! Were a little more bitter? or sour? than I remembered and not as popular with the kiddos as I thought they would be but still great nostalia item.
4,"Not like picture, but still good","Four stars because you don't get what the picture shows, you get what the title says -- you get strings of all green, all red, all pink. We REALLY wish we would get the four flavors as shown.However, these are still really cool candies. Though if you haven't had these before, you should know that after eating a bunch (hard to stop!), your mouth gets somewhat ""raw"" or scraped, kind of like eating a bunch of sour patch kids (but zots are more fun)."
5,great product and fast delivery!!,"I love thise candy, my daughter take them to school and everyone asks her to bring more and they fight over it!!!! I enjoy amaizing bubbly taste and surprize in the middle. Shipping was super fast and cheap. I was very pleased and going to order many more!!!!!!thank you!"
5,Blast from the Past,"Wow! I had forgotten how much I used to like these, and I still do, maybe there are only 3 flavors (I am old enough that I can't remember how many flavors these used to come in) but they still taste great, just sour and sweet enough, then when you least expect it, that fizz from the powder inside. My kids got a kick out of these, I guess they thought it was kinda cool to taste the kind of candy that ol momm used to eat when she was a kid."
5,what can i possibly say - they come in handy?,"Weird reviewing something I only used once for the most random task ever (attaching a bottle holder to my bike) but these work great, are super affordable as a set and I am sure will come in handy (just remember where you put them)."
5,A book to read over and over,"I picked up this book because of the title, and stayed with it because of the story. There's a lot to this book, undercurrents of meaning that you may not see the first time around. No, it won't teach you how to use a chisel. But it might teach you how to seize the moment and carve with it."
1,Garbage,"This is plain old garbage. I am not mexican but I enjoy mexican music,GOOD mexican music. People like Rocio Durcal, Juan Gabriel, Banda Cuisillos and others. But Graciela is far best the WORST of the worst. I think she tries too hard and there should be a new singer who can set her straight. The only reason she sells is because she has no competition. P.S. She has a cool name though! Ha!Ha!"
2,Este disco pertenece en la basura!,"Yo compre este disco sin saber como cantaba Graciela, y me arrepiento de aber gastado dinero en esta basura! Si pudiera regresar el tiempo no daba ni medio centavo."
1,Get Real!,"I saw the total for the ratings of this CD, and I think it had to be same person who reviewed this CD because it certainly does not deserve all those stars. Graciela has a poor ability to gain fans do to her thin voice. Dont waste your money on her material."
3,"Eric Clapton , The Survivor","One of Erics many works. I can not comment on this well, for I enjoy some of this other works more imensely."
2,Not performing up to expectations,"Despite the impeccable parentage -- Stars of The Lid have made some of the best ambient music of the past decade, and Labradford's sense of sound and space is masterful -- this collaboration between two of their members was disappointing to me. With the exception of ""The Girl With The Flesh Colored Crayon"", which is like Labradford at their best, the music here seems unfinished and meandering. Now, I'll admit that ""meandering"" and even ""like paint drying"" are adjectives that can fairly be applied to either Labradford or SOTL, but they somehow manage to make an absolute virtue of it -- in SOTL's case it's like some kind of fractal paint that you sit watching for hours as it subtly changes color and texture. But on this CD it's just ... meandering."
2,Don't get too excited about this...,"I know what you're thinking. SOTL and Labradford collaboration. Domination. The truth is - these songs are not bad by any means. They just cannot live up to the hype. Pretty flowing sounds and guitar parts shimmering throughout mediocre songs that evoke less emotion than the aforementioned bands generally exude. If you are a huge fan than go ahead and add it to your collection. If not, save your money and pick up something a little more cohesive..."
4,Great Camping Book,"great camping guide to the pacific northwest. book was in excellent condition, although it was used. very speedy shipper too!"
2,"The LP is great artistically, but lacks sound quality","I recieved my LP set today and this is a big dissapointment. I loved listening to Joy Division when I was younger. The interviews are horrible, and the music is recorded much too high of a level. Sounds like a recording of a cassette on a boombox, or when you try to recored music using your cel phone. In these days of digital remastering and 180 gram vinyl this LP is total disrespect to Ian Curtis."
1,It's a shame,"I only want to say that it's a shame that EA have the most incredible licenses like this for Superman or the FIFA license and the games that they made most of the time are very boring, with FIFA Konami has teach a lesson about how to make a real soccer game and in the case of Superman I really hope that the next game will be development by another company. I'm a big Superman fan, but this game is not what I expected for so long. I only have one last question, why they took so long to realese the game? It looks that they loss their time, I don't understand how they took so long and this is the result of all that work."
1,Glad I only rented it...,"I can't express how awful this game is. Its not only a disappointment to Superman fans, but to hardcore gamers as well. The controls are unresponsive, the graphics are blocky, the camera views are hard to center when you're in the middle of the action. This entire game seems like one big glitch. The game might actually be fun...if you can get past the 2nd level! RENT THIS GAME, don't buy it."
1,"Good concept, horrible execution","Fanboy that I am, I really wanted to like this game. The creators do a good job of capturing the excitement of being Superman and flying around Metropolis--as much fun at times as being Spider-man in his excellent games. However, that flying is about as fun as it gets. The combat is horrible with the player fighting the same enemy types at the last level encountered in the first level. An attempt is made to tie the game into the mediocre movie, but the player is never saving Lois or fighting Lex Luthor. The huge boss battle at the end is against a tornado. Seriously. The game also suffers from being short--easily beaten in six hours or less.If you're a fanboy like me, rent it and get it over with, but you'll be returning it to the store the next day. Saying that this is the best Superman game ever isn't saying much considering that there still hasn't been a good Superman game made."
1,Horrible beyond excuse! A Complete EA Movie Tie in Ripoff!,"Like the first reviewer I was excited about the game and picked it up as soon as it came out without first renting or trying it out beforehand. When it was pushed back I thought that it was a decision to make the game better - Not at all in this case. Unfortunately their additional effort must have gone into marketing and cut scenes rather than gameplay. The controls are unresponsive, camera does not follow well, menus are lame, and the manual is an afterthought.With games like God of War that do so much with visuals and even Hulk Ultimate Destruction (if you want to talk superhero games specifically) their is no excuse for such a third (or fourth) rate effort - especially when the game was pushed back!!! Superman - you deserved so much more from EA than ANOTHER CRAPPY interpretation."
1,A disappoitment game for a disappointment movie,"I'm a huge Superman fan so I was anxious to play this game, and pretend to be like Superman. What a huge mistake. And I'm sad to say that this game sucks hard time. Superman never had any real good video games in its history. And this is no exception. It's boring. All Superman do is fight silly robots. Why does he always have to fight robots in his games? The same problem withSuperman: Shadow of Apokolips. I didn't finished it because it is so lame.If you still would like to go through all this madness rent it first.And do yourself a favor, buy a real superhero game."
1,Extremely dissapointed!,This game is extremely bad. Bad storyline and bad graphic. Looks cheap and cheesy inspite of the effort to make it free roaming. You can get this game used for $20 or less.
3,Superman returns...................BOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game [...] in a number of ways...1. The graphics2. Sounds3. The difficulty (Notice how hard it is to get past level 2?)4. They used Brandon's face!!!5. They LIED about the free-roaming thingy6. The plot is so [...]7. You are invisible but the town isn'tIT JUST PLAIN [...]!!!!!!!!!
2,Not so good,Funnest thing to do is fly. Very hard to figure out what your supposed to do. Not happy with this game....
2,Boring and to hard,This game is really bad.The first couple of levels are pretty fun but then you are set free into the city of metropolis.I was reall looking forward to flying around metropolis wich I enjoyed for a little while but evetually I got bored and tried a mission.The Mission was incredibly hard and once I beat it I couldnt save and quit because you have to keep playing until you get to the next chapter.Unfortunately i did not know this so I saved and quit.When i came back to play it I was shocked and I was mad that the game restarted from the first mission in the chapter.So there it is you decide if you want to buy this awful game
5,They keep the fire burning!!!,"I have been a fan of Firehouse since the beginning. I have enjoyed everyone of their albums. There has not been a disappointment yet & this album is no acception. This is one of the greatest albums they have done. Some of them may not ""live up to"" the original, but, it does show that Firehouse can still rock & that time has not changed a thing. They keep getting better & better with every album. On a scale of 1-10, O2, just like all the previous & most recent, gets an 11! There is no stopping them. Best songs??? All of them. Any questions? Listen to the album. It speaks for itself."
4,Their best Album since 1992!!!,"This marks the return of one of the bigger bands from the early 1990's. O2 is by far their best album in a while. It blows Category 5 away!! If you like the first two albums then you should enjoy this one a lot. It might even be a little heavier than those two as well. The best song on the album is the second track called ""Take It Off"". It is a fist pumping tune that has perhaps the greatest lead guitar solo from any FH album to date. Check this one out, you will enjoy!"
3,Short & Sweet,"If you're looking for a mellow cd this isn't a bad choice. However, it is overproduced and lacks some heart. His style biting is rather apparent in some songs but it's okay, after all I own it."
3,A Good Place to Start,"This book is a good place to start for parents or teachers who want general information on the Special Education process. Although it covers a wide range of topics, it gives only basic information, lacking the details that parents and teachers seek. Since I had already done quite a bit of research in this area, I was disappionted. The book was basically a review on information that I had already found. If you are looking for a place to start, this is a good book to get you going. If you have already looked into this area, then you may also find this book lacking."
2,Men's Robe,Product is just OK. I will use it but don't expect it to last. Fabric is light and sewing is average at best.
2,When we got the robe the tye was missing,When we got the order it did not have the tye with it. So I had to return the chritmas gift I got for my boyfriend now I have to look for another one.
4,sensually awesome,"practically weightless but very sensual material, feels awesome on, unfortunately I touched it with too hot an iron and melted a spot so had to take it to a seamstress and have it shortened. Still looks and feels great."
3,it pretty good,"good rope for spring time or summa time. its light and silky. the only problem with it is when u try to tie it, it slips off."
2,Not what I expected,"I was searching for *silk* items and this is polyester. Be careful when looking, ""satin"" isn't necessarily silk."
1,Misled on search results,We were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and I guess I assumed tht it was silk. Rather stiff and uncomfortable.
4,Nice Cool Robe.,Robe is really light and has a sleek silky feel. Great for wearing around the house on a hot summer night. Great buy for the price.
1,wouldn't buy again,Very nice feeling robe and fit well. Although I only had it 3 weeks and one washing and the seams on the lapel started coming undone.My wife is now making me one instead.
5,Classic Mr. Natural,"Ol' Natch gets in a pickle, but never fear, the mind triumphs over matter. Excellent quality publication, guick shipping and arrived in perfect condition."
4,Music from a CW/ ROCK Beginning,Robbin The Cradle is an Early CW Rock Start. It is easy listning . It's a nice addition to your collectionLenny
2,Good for beginners...marginally useful for experienced runners,"This would be a great book for beginning runners. Discussions and sample training plans do not provide enough detail for experienced runners. Look at it more as a ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the works of Fixx, Sheehan, Henderson, et. al."
5,The Best times ten!!,"This book was sooo touching and totally real!! I loved it. At the end I cried from not knowing what was going to happen to Mary Anne or the BSC but soon read Everything Changes and was so happy to see closure in her story. I reccomend this book to anyone, and everyone. Congratulations and keep up the good work Ann!!!!!"
5,Poor Mary Anne,I cannot believe Mary Anne's house burned down! She and Dawn were VERY upset. But I can't figure out why Mary Anne could not cry. She normally cries right when she SEES something sad or cute. Or even HEARS about it. Finally one night she is able to cry. Dawn cried when she got one look at the house. I was glad they got to save A FEW things even if they weren't worth very much. I an VERY glad Tigger woke Mary Anne up. She might not have gotten out in time if he hadn't. I loved the book.
1,I'm not going to read AMM anymore,"Sometimes it's nice to get away from reality by reading a good book. I was always able to do this with BSC books but from the way things look I won't be able to anymore. I'd better take a good look around the bookstore for good books sometime 'cause I won't be reading Ann M. Martin's ""realistic"" garbage anymore."
4,Great ideas and info for a better sex life,"This book gives you a whole new perspective on gay life in general. Gay sex, lifestyles, community and identity are just part of the information you will find in this book... You also enjoy the tastfull drawings showing a variety of couples in lovings situation... Note that this book was written in the pre-AIDS era and you must take into account this when reading the safe sex recommendations.."
1,BLAH,"HAHAHAHAHAHAH IT WAS HORRIBLY BAD, I WISH I NEVER READ IT, THE WRITING WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD. Though the pictures were great."
4,"Quick read, hits on many themes with us today.","I thought this was a good book and could not put it down. It explores the issues of assimilation among Budapest's Jews, conversion issues, Jewish and Catholic relations, Jesiwh security or lack thereof, Catholic complicity in the Holocaust and the Catholic church setting the stage for millenia that made the Holocaust possible. It also talks of family love and connectedness despite serious philosophical differences. We're discussing this in my book club and it should be very interesting."
3,Fascinating,"I was inspired to do a search on Padre Pio and my dear Monsignor Pogany and found this book. My family and I loved Monsignor Pogany and this book has given my Catholic practise a deeper meaning. I do not understand the bitterness towards Monsignor Pogany within his family. Eugene belittles Monsignor Pogany and I cannot wonder if he were alive what this book might have been. I do know Monsignor Pogany was a caring, humble, very cultured and educated man who spoke many languages. He was not the lightweight, absent man Eugene portrays. My experience witnessing his warm and loving friendship with our Jewish family friend doesn't jive with this book. This is a Eugene's tribute to his distant father and the trials he underwent in an attempt to understand the family's sadness. What this book clearly illustrates is the work of Satan in creating hatred among people and brothers. A warning to us to keep God's love and light in our hearts as we approach the Apocalypse."
4,Good Enough Blade,Its a good sword. However it would be wiser to save up and buy the more expensive one though.
3,Good and bad,The good: it's a handy way to keep sunblock for the kids in the car. I also found my toddler aged kids didn't fuss as much about these vs. regular sunblock.The bad: you don't get very many wipes for the money. They're still somewhat messy (though not quite as messy as a bottle of sunblock).If you live somewhere where you need a lot of sunblock this isn't for you. If you have a case where you only need it occasionally and looking for a lower mess options this would be a good choice.
1,Bad Product,"I purchased this product because my toddler hates when I rub sunscreen on his face. I thought this would be like a diaper wipe where the product applies easily. This is basically a cloth dipped in thick and creamy sunscreen, it takes the same efford and mess as applying it with your hands. The only difference is that this is a lot more expensive (6 applications for $10, while a whole bottle of sunscreen cost about $5). On top of it, my son got a really bad reaction from the product, it is definetely not made for babies' and toddlers' skin."
1,"Not just ""bad""......painful","If you gave uncle irwin a video camera before he went to maui, you would have a more interesting and realistic film about marrakech's Jemaa El Fena. Beyond boring, like a broken webcam."
2,A complete and utter waste of time,"Now, I am a collector of anime anad have been a big fan of Dragon Ball Z for a long time. But I would beg you to see the real Dragon Ball Z before buying this chopped up, edited version. I know that it says uncut, but it's really not. I'm not saying that violence is good or anything, but I am saying that this was a show that was originally meant for adults in Japan and was brought over seas by Funimation and turned into a little kiddie show. If you do not want to see the real Japanese version, then be my guest and buy this video, but if you would like to see the real thing, pick it up at your local comic book shop. But, since Funimation is clearly not going to ever bring the real thing over seas in subtitled, uncut Japanese, then DBZ will never have the charm that it was meant to have."
5,DBZ all the way,this was 1 of funimations better dbz dvd's it was especially cool that trunks is starring in his 2nd dvd where he is on the cover in this dvd he meets goku and tests goku's strength we also find out that his parents are VEGETA and BULMA (amazing)
4,Great DVD for a great saga,"This dvd is a must for dbz fans. It even has 5 episodes instead of 3 and that is awesome. I would buy this trunks dvd because in my opinion it is one of the best sagas on dbz.My only problem with the dvd is that the picture seems kinda grainy. It seems like the picture could be clearer and fine tuned but this also beats the 3 episode VHS version by far. So if you want the trunks saga, be sure to buy them on dvd."
5,Super Saiyan Confrontation,"This tape really begins to add depth to the dragonballz post-freiza storyline. And for the first time we see a confrontation between two super saiyans! Needless to say, Vegeta is now more determined than ever to become a super saiyan. Trunks appearance is very cool."
4,Freeza is destroyed,"This video finally shows that freeza dies at the hands of a super saiyan. I personally loved seing what happens to King Cold. I won't say anything else because you just have to see it to believe it. However, if it wasn't for the English dubbed dialogue as an alternative to the rediculous, effeminate Japanese dialogue and how often boring the Japanese version makes the series sound, I would not recommend buying it."
1,sucks serious braunswager,"Episode 106 - Welcome Back GokuAfter handily beating Frieza and his evil father, King Cold, the mysterious stranger announces the exact time and place of Goku's arrival on Earth. But can this young Super-Saiyan predict the future?! Gohan and the others are determined to find out!Episode 107 - Mystery RevealedAfter testing Goku in combat, the mysterious stranger reveals his true identity! But what does his timely arrival portend?! In a startling conversation with Goku, this powerful emissary from the future tells all!Episode 108 - Goku's Special TechniqueThe future has been written -- or has it? That's what Goku and the rest of the Z Fighters must decide as they learn of Trunks' ominous warning. The Androids are coming! And they just might be bringing the end of the world along with them!"
1,They did not send me the one with the 5 episodes,If there sending out the ones with the 5 episoded then i got Jiped i got the one with the 3 what is going on it would be nice if u made up your minds and tell us what your sending out so i can deside if i want to buy it or not i had to send the one with the 3 back
1,not up to Disney music standard,"Unlike most disney CDs, this one is more a compliation of music more appropriate for a movie trailer than listening. With the exception of the classic ""Bella Notte"", most others are not what kids can sing along with. If you like rap-style ""singing"" you then it's more tolerable. Note this is various artists- no Glenn Close."
5,Monoi Yland Ylang,"This oil is wonerful, takes you to the tropics. The coconut oil and the Ylang Ylang oil mix well together and is a very nice aromatherapy treat."
4,Fascinating account of Kennedy and Johnson and Vietnam,"While a little dry sometimes this is Halberstam's definitive book. It really shows how the years of McCarthyism leading up to Kennedy's administration led to many terrible decisions about supporting Diem and trying to not look weak to the Russians. After the fiasco that was the Bay of Pigs Kennedy became even more determined to show strength. However the first tragedy among many was the assasination which while horrible in itself also came at a critical time in the course of the Vietnam policy. Halberstam theorizes that Kennedy was nearly ready to pull the plug on Vietnam when he died. Well written, incredibly well researched and an important book."
3,Probably better to read the book,"I bought this by mistake (I wanted the book) but thought I would listen to it anyway. Clennon's efforts to sound like JFK, LBJ, & others adds a measure of irritation to an abridgement that lacks continuity and color. There's no time to examine any particular character in detail so we are left with glosses, poor impersonations and an endless sequence of ""reports"""
2,gave up,"This is a pretentious book even before it begins. The long-winded preface written by Halberstam was self-serving and vain, and rubbed me the wrong way. After getting that behind me, I tried plowing through the main body, but gave up. I was born in the early 60s, so I'm not as familiar with some of the characters or politics of that era (hence my desire to read the book), and I found myself getting lost by some of the tangents, complex sentences, and ancillary information. He was trying to cram too much information and too many diverse thoughts into each sentence. Despite my effort, I was not getting much insight into the characters.I read his book ""The Fifties"" a while ago and remembered it as a good book. Likewise, I had high hopes for this book, but in the end, I gave up."
4,An excellent insight into our Vietnam experience!,"I'm a Vietnam Vet (US Navy type) and lived the experience of the run-up and build-up to VN in ""my years"" 1963-66. This book filled in a lot of blanks about the people and politics behind our getting into the VN debacle. The author does a great job analyzing the thinking and actions of Kennedy's people in particular, but also those key individuals that came before them. I had read the author's book about the Korean War and liked his style of writing. Glad I found and read ""Best and Brightest""."
4,Halberstam Failed To Mention One Important Point,"Brilliant work. I have always recommended this book to foreigners interested in American foreign policy. Halberstam, however, forgets one important point. The Vietnam War was a ""liberal"" war in the Wilsonian tradition of liberal internationalism. It was concerned with state building and ""making the world safe for democracy."" Halberstam instead explain the Democrats initial hawkish stance toward the war as a response to congressional Republican attacke on their party as being soft on communism. In truth, it was within the North American liberal internationalist tradition to enter Vietnam and fight the war as it was fought. From the strategic hamlets to ""winning the hearts and minds"" it clearly was a liberal war. Conservatives were traditionally isolationist, with a more liberal, eastern section (mentioned in the book) supportive of agressive internationalism. For more thoughts on this subject see ""Promised Land, Crusader State"" by Walter Macdougal."
4,bought it as a present for a friend - he LOVES it!,"If you are a Viet Nam buff, this is the encyclopedia of information and, according to my friend, Very readable. Worth every penny!"
3,The Best and the Brightest,"This is an important book for anyone interested in how the US became inextricably involved in Vietnam. It holds pertinent lessons for the predicament in which the US now finds itself in Iraq. Unfortunately, the book requires a determined reader to plow through some 650 pages of close-spaced narrative, as the author frequently diverges on tangents that drift away from his main thesis points. A principal thrust of the book is the influence of key players on the decision-making process and their inter-personal relationships. Accordingly, there is substantial biographical information, which is interesting, but distracting. This is not a military history; very little mention is made of the operational and tactical aspects of the conflict."
2,"He's back, but is this the Egyptian Lover we all knew?","Egyptian Lover needs to go back to his roots. While it is better than ""get into it"", it still lacks the sounds of the Egyptian Lover I once knew and loved. Some tracks like ""world of girls"" and ""Gotta Have Ya"" are reminiscent of the sound that I am talking about, otherwise the album has a hip-hop sound rather than a techno-funk sound Egyptian Lover first made so popular. I miss this artist, it has been years since another release has come out. I wonder if he will come out with another album? If so, he needs to go back to his old style and rock the house!"
4,"DOES ANYONE REMEMBER ""UNCLE JAMS ARMY""?","If you call yourself an Egyptian Lover fan, then you better have Uncle Jams Army under your belt! This was when Greg was at his best! I remember dancing all night long at the Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California, along with my friend Pete, who was a friend of his. This was when partying was safe, and we closed the place DOWN!He turned the place out! Listening to the CD don't do justice. You have to hear him LIVE! If you missed Uncle Jams Army in the 80's, then you certainly missed the real Egypt."
4,A brief but enjoyable telling of Washingtons life.,"Although this DVD doesn't break any new ground or delve very deeply into GW's life, they do cover a great deal of ground in a reletively short time. They go over some of GW's youth, particularly his involvement in the French and Indian war. They go over his involvment in the revolution as well. It is most done through dramatic reinactments that are entertaining and enjoyable. THey do have the typical talking head that chime in between and during sequences. I really didn't learn anything new about GW, but nonetheless found the DVD to be a very good refresher course for GW basics. For the GW novice it will be a good way to begin your study of GW. I would definitely recommend this DVD to novice and scholar alike."
5,"""Turn Down the Lights"": the Cool Ruler strikes again.","This recording should please long-time Gregory Isaacs fans and newcomers to reggae alike. To be sure, it is one of his strongest releases since ""Night Nurse"". Check out songs such as 'Hold Tight' or 'Flirting Around' and it will become abundantly clear why this international treasure of an artist has persevered for over thirty years."
5,Incredible achievement in writing!,"A 250 page lipogram - a book written without using words that contain a specific letter, in this case the letter 'e'. No ""the"" no ""he"" or ""she"", no words that end in ""ed"". Really incredible!The story is pretty interesting too, and surprisingly fluid to read, given the constraints. The story does, however, contain many references to Paris in the late 60s, which makes the story a bit challenging if you don't know them."
4,myster e,This writer is like no other. To be able to write a whole novel and not include the letter E is a task. He writes well and keeps you in suspense. highly recommended.
5,Great pan,"I have this pan in the Calphalon Commercial, and also in the Regular Simply.I bought this pan for my Son, and he says it cooks great, and a great big size. I paid for this pan in the begining of March -07 $25.99..I couldn't beat the price,so I had to buy it..This seems a bit lighter then the regular Simply, but it works just fine.The handle is split in the middle and when I used it , it hurt my hand, but I have thin hands.I got what the picture showed, a 5 qt pan, with a stainless lid..I don't care for glass lids after having one fall and break, although it was not Calphalon.This comes in a white box, not Calphalan, so I would not give this as a gift..But its still a wonderful Pan.I have used mine for so many differents types of cooking."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PAN!!!","I was using a stainless steel ""chicken fryer"" but it was sooooo heavy. This Calphalon pan is wonderful! It's light yet sturdy. The heat was evenly distributed and I had no ""cold"" spots. I don't even mind the unusual handle. I could grip it comfortably. I thought my previous pan was big but it actually fit inside the Calphalon pan. It was money well spent. I am very pleased with the pan. I bought a new set of hard anodized cookware less than a year ago and I'm very sorry it wasn't Calphalon."
3,Discription doesn't match picture,"Patsy seems to have received what was described, not what is pictured. I'm very glad I looked into this, as I also wanted a glass lid.* Heavy gauge anodized aluminum for excellent heat conductivity* Nonstick interior surface; brushed stainless steel coverHad to give it a rating, so I gave it 3, though all of my Simply Calphalon pots & pans are surely 4.5!!!"
5,"Quench your thirst for ""prego"" knowledge","This book is all about information. I never felt this book left out any facts I was looking for. It was the definitive book I got my information from (out of many, many books). It was a valuable resource for both my first AND second pregnancies. It can be a little text heavy at times, I certainly wouldn't recommend sitting down and reading it like a novel. But when taken a topic at a time, this book is one you don't want to be without during your pregnancy."
5,Great purchase,These two NB-4L batteries are easy to charge and they stays charged!! I amhappy with how well the work in my ELPH 300 HS. Now I won't miss a picture!!!
5,Very well done.,I find the instruction in this book to be very easy to understand and follow. Nothing is overly hyped and the studnt is encouraged to take it slowly.
5,THE WAY OF ENERGY ; THE BIBLE OF BOOKS ON STANDING !,"I can only say that ""The Way Of Energy"" is probably the finest book on standing Qi Gong or Zhan Zhuang that I've ever seen. It is also the most innovative. There is nothing easy about anything in this book, so don't let anyone fool you. Qi Gong is hard work. The author is innovative, because he has devised many different ways to keep you motivated enough to get through your daily practice; listening to music, clenching your toes against the floor, imagery, and even watching TV! I've owned this book for almost three years, and I constantly refer back to it. It is really a masterpiece on the subject, brilliantly written, and the instructions are given with an air of warm kindness. This book should never go out of print. It really is the last word on the subject!"
5,Excellent work,"This is an exceptional book. Though my practice is limited to seated postures right now, as I build my strength, I plan to use this book for the next step in my practice. Full size illustrations. Easy to follow. I enjoyed it so much I have purchased other books by Master Lam."
2,Not Useful,Books like this are fairly useless when it comes to learning something that requires learning physical movements. It's much easier to learn and more likely to learn correctly by getting a DVD on qigong. I'd recommend Spring Forest QiGong by Chunyi Lin. Or most anything by Bruce Frantzis.
1,"Horrible Movie, avoid at all cost!","This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! BORING doesnt even describe it. The Sabertooth Tiger you see on the cover and in all the previews is in maybe....5 minutes of the movie. 75% of the movie is this guy walking around lost... ""Whats the point""??? I like Roland Emerick's other movies but this was BAD! First movie I have EVER ""walked out"" on."
1,So bad. Its the worst,"I had expected 10K BC to be on the order of Gladiator or another epic movie - even Quest for Fire.However, after popping in the disc and watching the first 5 minutes, I knew I was in for a horrifying waste of film and time. Boring dialog, horrible intros, you name it - it had it.I ended up fast forwarding through the entire movie. Skip, listen, skip and listen again. All in all, this film isn't worth the 10 minutes it takes to skip through all of it.Save your $1.99 - this film sucks and should be forgotten."
4,Great movie,"For everyone who thinks they know all about life in 10,000 BC, you don't. Last I heard, there are no written records. Yes, the mammoth stampede is the most exciting bit of the film but throughout this film maintains interest and believability. The landscape of the middle east and north Africa was different then so walking from glacier to desert was a possibility. The acting here is good enough for the simple dialogue and story and the visuals are great. I guess some people expected to see dinosaurs. Sorry, wrong eon."
2,Nonsensical,"I had not expected much but this was even worst than I feared. Basically, it's a ""Last of the Mohicans"" wanna-be movie but the script is nonsensical. It's based on the borderline crackpot theory espoused by some that there were advanced human civilizations before the last Ice Age, spawned by refugees from Atlantis. Too many things defy a suspension of disbelief, however; I won't go through them all.To cut to the point: while not the worst movie I've ever seen, this is a bad film. I would have been pissed if I would have paid full price to see it in the theater (or to buy this DVD).Not recommended."
1,Not Worth Renting,"Horrible movie, theres alot better movies out there. I wish i never saw it, the previews make it out ot be a better show then it turned out to be. There was alot of stuff in the movie that just didnt happen at that time. The film looked good on my big TV, but the story line, plot and all the errors from that time period was a big let down. Rent it if you must but dont buy it before seeing it first."
1,"Absolute garbage (it was Apocolypto, but in english)","This movie is not worth your money or time. Even if you watch it for free at someones house please do something more productive, like exercise by trying to dodge moving cars. Thats better than watching this movie. Its pretty much like Apocolypto but in english. Its one of those movies that looks so AMAZING from the preview, but thats the only thing worth watching. might as well watch that and see all the CGI eye candy and not bother with the whole movie"
3,"Pretty good movie, but not what I expected...","This was a pretty decent movie...but these cavemen were very intelligent, and spoke english very well....decent movie, but not what I was expecting...glad I waited to see it on DVD..."
3,Not the best film!!,"This film was quite slow, not to much happening.Some great scenes and effects but not what i had hoped for.."
3,Good movie,"Echoing some of the other reviews, it was a good movie and worth a watch (especially on my 52"" Sony with 7.1 surround). It wasn't great by any means, but it was visually and audibly entertaining."
3,Good movie to watch once,"I liked the movie, but its not good enough to buy. Its great once and thats it. Rent it but I don't suggest buying it."
1,Bad just doesn't say enough!,"I won't repeat all the things that have been said here before, except to say that the worst possible review would be kind compared to the torture of sitting through this movie! Honestly, this is right up there with ""From Dusk to Dawn"" for all-time worst movies ever! You know, you're watching an outlaw movie, outlaw movie, outlaw movie, BAM, you're really watching a vampire movie! So, caveman movie, caveman movie, BAM iron-age movie, iron-age movie, BAM weird occult movie! That's the story of ""10,000 B.C."" Honestly, the only way I can describe how I feel after watching this movie is: VIOLATED!"
2,Ok but a bit too much creative license,"Effects good. acting VeryGood, characters good. Story line.... a bit out of the ordinary, mixing multiple timelines and histories into a mini epic. Creative but ultimately a little weird"
3,Fun movie,"I know this movie didn't get good reviews, but I enjoyed it. Just remember this is fiction, don't get wrapped up on a reality trip. It isn't one of the great movies, but it was fun to watch. I would recommend it to someone that just wants to be entertained."
5,Worth watching!,"I second what Patrick said. This movie was interesting and fun. It reminded me of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies in it's style. I came away glad that I had taken the time to watch it, and I hope that more people do!"
4,imagination,I loved this movie even with it's historical errors. some times you just have to let your imagination go and enjoy the story. it's all about love and courage and a mans desire for freedomalso i liked the suggestion of an advanced culture (atlantis)in this prehistoric setting
2,"Brilliant Title, Awful Baddly Done","The movie has similar senses of Apocalypto, but nothing could match that film. It had a few interesting moments(the Mammoth Hunting, Bird chasing), but that was it."
3,ok movie,"I am not a huge fan of this movie, but bought it for a friend as a gag gift since we always joked about it."
3,"Long, Long Ago","10,000 BC is a prehistoric fantasy. To me, it has a flavor of Dances With Wolves meets Jurassic Park with just a touch of Mad Max's Beyond Thunderdome. The movie has numerous scenes of stunning beauty such as majestic snow covered peaks, golden sand dunes, and a sea filled with boats that have massive, vivid red sails to name a few.The story is okay. At the beginning of the movie, a narrator tells the legend of how a beautiful blue eyed girl, the lone survivor of her people, came to live with the tribe and the prophecy associated with her. I liked that the movie didn't have crude or foul language. I think that aspect created an appropriate ambiance for the simple lifestyle of the prehistoric tribe.One of the earlier scenes with the woolly mammoths reminds me of the old elephant jokes. In tribute to them I'd like to say: When the wild herd of stampeding mammoths came running across the terrain the ancient tribe recognized them immediately because they weren't wearing sunglasses."
1,Is zero stars an option?,"Wow, so bad, such a waste of time, you'd have to see it to believe it. This movie doesn't work, on any level. Badly written, badly cast, highly derivative and boringly predictable, its pace plods and action / CGI fails to impress. The sabretooth tiger is only in 2 short scenes, btw, and what appears to be an ""epic"" movie (even if only for special effects) is in fact like a poor man's Conan. The lead actor/actress are both laughably bad... Blue-eyed teenybopper beauty with makeup and (lol) model skinny-flabby arms who's supposed to be part of a hardscrabble Himalayan-mountain-type tribe? Just one example of the silliness you won't be able to suspend your disbelief over. I won't even start on the historical / geographical nonsense. Did i mention it was boring? Took me 3 separate sessions to finally watch all the way through to the end. I paid $2.50 for the DVD and feel like it was money badly spent."
2,A Bit Silly....,"A bit silly...At least the Clan of the Cave Bear had a story...This one attempted to have a story...suspend your disbelief... big time.They tied it into what some people believe is the time when the Sphinx was built (10,000BC) and, some notion that the Sphinx and the complex around it was built by some God(s)...Two of which had died already. Needless to say, the hero killed the ""God"" and when the veil was removed, the ""God"" was an old grey-haired guy. The CGI of the Saber Tooth Tiger was laughable... Although the giant man-eating Dodo birds were a bid amusing. They conveniently ate a few of the ""bad"" guys. This movie had great landscape photography though (some of which I'm sure was CGI too.)"
1,Good Lord!!!!,"Roland Emmerich should have taken the money used to make this film, and fed a starving village. Ooga Booga subtitles might have helped? Or maybe some bigger prosthetic foreheads. ""Laughable man"""
4,A story about cave men... not prehistoric creatures!,"10,000 BC is an entertaining story about cave men, travelling and facing multiple situations. If you don't expect more than that it does the job. The story could have been more sophisticated, but the rich landscapes and the detailed CG prehistoric creatures make it quite believeable. The trailer was a bit misleading as it puts the emphasis on the creatures, whereas they have a rather minority role in this story.I'd recommend it on Blu-ray rather than DVD if you watch it over a large enough screen, as it is mostly a visual story. There are epic battle scenes (an Emmerich speciality), but I think the movie goes beyond that.Also there are more efficient top notch image blu-rays (Planet Earth series, Pixars, etc.).Don't set your expectations too high and you'll enjoy it!"
2,Disapointing,"I was very disapointed in this film. I waited until it's release to DVD to see it and was disappointed how little CGI there was. I felt it was based on the foundation of one families difficulty in daily living. I expected it to be more broad of a scope beings it's title says ""10,000 BC"". There were more than them around and a lot more animals, volcano's, sea life... etc."
1,DUMBDUMBDUMB DUMMMM DUMMMM,"I'm sorry, but this movie sucked. I know or care nothing about history so believe me when I say that it is still a lousy movie whether it is accurate or not. The action sucked, the love story sucked, the casting sucked, the plot sucked, the wonderful pinball wooly mammoths sucked. The only cool thing in the whole movie was the big meat eating birds. It seemed like the plot had too much it was trying to do and it just didn't really get anything done. Kind of like they just tried to take the best parts of a ton of different movies and still botched the whole thing."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"Like most of you I'm an avid movie fan. This is not a movie so much as it's a 2 hour nap put on film. For the love of God watch anything, and I do mean anything, other that this garbage. Primate looses girl to evil other primative, primate rescues girl. CAN YOU JUST FEEL THE EXCITEMENT!Forget the fact that this film has all the historical accuracy of the Flintstones, (or Kansas public schools), the movie leaves you asking the question, ""I spent 2 hours doing what?!""Honestly, save your time and your money. Just take a nap, same effect but you save some money and your dreams will almost certainly be FAR more entertaining."
4,"Not highbrow cinema, but fun escapist entertainment","My wife and I picked up this movie this morning, popped it in the DVD player after dinner and just finished watching it. Okay, it doesn't break cinematic new ground and is hardly a classic. But, as semi-historical fantasy adventure flicks go, it was entertaining and worth the price and time in our opinion. If you're just looking for a fun movie to watch with a decent storyline, lots of action (but relatively little blood or gore) and some great visuals, you could do a lot worse than ""10,000 B.C."""
2,boring,This movie was boring as hell. The movie took a long time to develop and the characters were uninteresting. The story was awful. And the movie is long. Not sure how else to explain it. But it gets 2 stars because it at least the pyramids looked good.
1,Garbagefest from start,"WOW, this is a stupid, pointless, bad, cgi fest. Horrible acting, DUMB DUMB script. This makes Bad Boys 2 look like Casablanca. All the suckers who paid to see this on opening weekend should have been given tshirts that said ""CGI SHEEP"" on them. Make a trailer with a cool effect and fill the seats as the people go ""OHH SHINY"". I watched this off a copy a friend of mine ""acquired"" and I actually felt ripped off of time wasted. To quote the people of South Park ""RableRableRable"""
1,doesn't work on this computer,sorry i can't give you any other info....the dvd does not work on this computer....
5,Amazing! Epic love story!,"Movie covers all the bases. Love, Action, Warfare, Beasts. Overall EPIC movie! with GREAT music."
2,Leaves a lot to be desired...,"The beginning of the movie was AWESOME. I was all psyched, and the opening showed a lot of promise. I was eager to see what the movie would be about... and I was horribly disappointed.The historical inaccuracies made me weep. I thought it couldn't get any worse. But the plot holes were even worse. There was no effort made to explain where the 'god' came from, what kind of powers he had (how he got all these people to obey him) or the background for this weird civilization. In the end, nothing made sense, and a movie that started out as interesting ended up as frustrating and confusing."
3,"10,000 BC - Do not go here for history as we believe it to be.","10,000 BC was an entertaining film with good special effects, interesting but one dimensional charactors and questionable acting efforts. I would, however, rate it as a three star film and enjoyed the story despite its lack of fidelity with what our scientists believe about history as revealed to us through science."
3,"10,000 BC","I was a litle disappointed in this movie. The trailers made it look like it was going to be an exciting movie to watch, but I found it a bit boring. I wouldn't call it a ""B"" rated movie, but it isn't an ""A"" either. The story was good, the acting OK. Would have liked it better if there had been more interaction with the creatures."
2,Kind of like a hot girl at the bar.,"This movie is easy to look at, gives you something to do while you think about something else and best of all it's disposable. Sure, you can invest your precious time in paying attention to it, but does doing so really get you anywhere and do you come out of it a better person? Probably not. Rent this, but before you return it scratch it up really badly. You have now just paid it forward: The next renter, unable to watch it, will be saved 2 hours of time he probably should be spending mailing out child support checks anyway. Job well done. Pat yourself on the back.But seriously, don't pay for this movie."
1,Very forgettable,What a terrible movie. Who makes this junk and why? I didn't see it that long ago and I couldn't tell you a thing about what happened in it. Thank god I didn't pay to see it at the movies.
4,"Not a History Lesson, but an Entertaining Movie!","Historical inaccuracies aside, I thought this was a good movie! I enjoyed the love story, the travels and scenery, and the acting. I had put off seeing it because of the bad reviews, and I am sorry that I waited so long. Keeping in mind the movie is fiction, watch it and enjoy!"
2,Just too boring..,"I am a sucker for ""monsters"" and beasts in general. Been that since childhood and I'm close to 40 now. So although I already knew about the ""not so good"" critics for this movie, I just wanted it to see it because of the pre-historic beasts.Alas, even they and the nice scenic cannot save this picture. It's just too boring. Acting is bad. And even the beasts were not as good as I hoped to be. The hairy elephants (don't know what they're called in English :) ) were ok. About as nice as the ones in LOTR. But the Sabretooth Tiger was just not realistic enough. And the ""interaction"" with it was too far fedged! Come on, this is a wild beast! not some nice little kitten!Lots of deja vu's as well. Especially from LOTR and Jurassic park. The whole ""run through high vegetation area while being chased by unknown beasts"" is just a Jurassic Park rip off.Anyway, rent it or buy it cheap second hand if you're really ""into"" these kind of beasts/monsters/dino's, else just leave it be."
1,"10,000 B.S.!!!!!","I didn't know they spoke English ten thousand years before Christ was born.This movie was 300 meets Quest For Fire. The best part of this movie was when it ended.Instead of a Razzie award, please give this movie The Golden Vacuum Cleaner award, because it sucked!"
2,Apocalypto meets Braveheart meets the Ten Commandments,"...or something. I mean, this is such a mishmash that it's hard to know where to begin.spoilers belowSo cavemen are living in the Ice Age, but if they walk a few miles, they discover savannas and deserts. Oh, and there are slaves and mammoths being used to build pyramids. Is this Africa or South America or what? And the abducted young woman never gets her makeup messed up, even when she's dragged along and beaten and kept as a slave. Riiiiiight.And check this out: this woman receives a fatal wound but recovers a few minutes later because some old lady back in her home camp dies and lets her live, or whatever. Really, what does it matter by then? Grab some candy and a drink, sit back and be entertained, but for gosh sakes, don't expect a history lesson."
1,"10,000 BC IS YOUR TYPICAL MINDLESS ACTION FLICK","After seeing this movie, I was itching my head because this is the same director that did ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""ID4"" ""STARGATE"" How did this movie go so wrong. It tried to intimidate Frank Miller's 300. It fails badly.If your desperate to watch a movie on a Friday night, please choose something else then 10,000 B.C. You will hurt afterwards if you do. Asking for your money and time back."
1,Boring!,"I kept thinking to myself in the first 5-10 minutes, I should just turn this off. I really should have. It doesn't get any better as you keep watching. Save yourself the time and watch something else."
1,Defines Hollywoodized Crap,"Definitely one of the worst movies of 2008. Crtitics described this as a dumbed down Apocalypta. That is an exageration. It is way worse than a dumbed down Apocalypta. It is absolutely terrible. It lacks a story. What it does have is a crew of very good special effects artists. Other than that this is non-stop violence. This type of movie would mostly be appealing to a red-neck crowd, because all they care about is violence, and could care less if there was a story."
2,"10 Things I Learned from 10,000 B.C.","Ten things I learned from 10,000 B.C. (spoilers beware!):1) Nobody speaks in contractions.2) Everybody is dirty.3) Nobody speaks the same language except for one guy in Africa, and yet the translation of ""Mammoths"" is ""Mannak.""4) The way to get a bull mammoth to stampede is to stand up in the middle of the herd and scream your head off.5) Even isolated arctic tribes have tremendous racial diversity.6) The pyramids were built either by space aliens or Atlanteans.7) Egyptian pharaohs were white guys who spit a lot.8) 10,000 B.C. had its own versions of velociraptors: giant angry chickens.9) For some reason only white men can lead the more powerful and numerous African tribes.10) Blue-eyed girls are hot."
1,"The movie 10,000 B.C felt like it was 10,000 years long!","The movie 10,000 B.C is one of those movies that you should listen to the critics about. On Yahoo it has a C- rating by Top Critics. I was like who cares,the critics are always wrong, right. Well, I should have listened to them for sure. It did have action, but Roland Emmerich messed up on this one. First of all the Earth has not been around for 10,000 years. Second off, the movie was poorly made and really annoying at times. Don't see one of the worst movies that has a huge budget and has nothing good to talk about.Story:FActing:FAction:DDirection:FVisual effects:D+Rating:D"
1,wow,"All this movie needed was a talking sloth and it could have been Ice Age3, but wait, that would've made it a good movie...so, i guess I'm wrong there."
3,Could have been sooo much more...,"A great movie will hold you as soon as it starts with its music, introduction of characters and story and will not let you go till itends. This movie tries but did not succeed very good. It had the ideasbut could not exploit them sucessfully... Due to the lack of violence thatcomes with the territory of taking slaves...it almost feels like it readyto be shown on family TV...and most of them talk like they are too educated to be in 10,0000 BC.Good for a view......"
5,Even my wife liked this movie as much as I did.,"Who cares if it isn't historically accurate. We weren't there 10,000 years ago and can only guess what it was like based on bones of animals and humans and tools dug up. As to their relationships other than banding together to hunt, we don't know since they didn't leave a written history. It is a great movie of a story that might have been. I enjoy stories. I don't want sex for the sake of sexual exploitation and rediculuous violence for the sake of violence. It was a love story as well as an action story making it one that my wife and I could enjoy together. It has heros and bad guys. It has adventure and shows family life. It may be about early man but is still relevant to life today. We just have more gagets in our lives. If you didn't like the movie then that is your problem and you have a right to like sex and gore but if a movie doesn't have a story to tell it is worthless. This one had a really good story to tell."
1,Hang Roland Emmerich,"Sweet Jesus. One of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Poor story telling, lousy structure, complete lack of imagination. There not a single thing redeeming about this steaming turd."
4,good for educators,"The movie starts out with a great depiction of what life might have been like 12,000 years ago. Great mammoth hunt scenes, use of tools, shelter, depiction of tundra...if you teach 5th grade or up and cover the stone age and the beginning of agriculture these aspects of the movie are great. Unfortunately, the movie depicts pyramids being built some 7,000 years before they actually were and other historical inaccuracies. However, again, if you teach units on Stone Age, Mesopotamia, Egypt, etc., this movie can serve as a great critical thinking text as students analyze the events in the movie for historical accuracy. On top of this it is exciting and has NO ""inappropriate"" parts - no sex, swearing, etc."
5,Amazing CGI effects!,"I just saw the movie. Its a great storyline. But above all, the special effects are amazing, worthy of watching on HD with a booming surround sound. I rented it at one of those vending machines at the supermarket. I wanna watch it in blue ray , once i get my PS3 this week. Enjoy.Oh, and by the way. I'm sure the actors are getting a lot of heat in these reviews, but they're newcomers. So, you won't get the same tired old faces like cruise, foster or samuel l. jackson...lol. not that there's anything wrong with them but: I'm tired of these m-----f----- snakes!!! lol"
3,"10,000 BC?","dub the language, install subtitles but do not make people sit through this crap. the conversations in this movie had ""gooder"" vocab skills than myself. raise the rating, lose the talk, lose the clothes, up the violence and call me back. only the mammoths get three stars!!!!"
2,Fun if you are younger than 9,"Truly a mishmash of misinformation and adventure, but I knew that before ordering. It's a gift for alittle boy. But the business end of the transaction was excellent."
1,item description is misleading and not as described,"I ordered this product because of the Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1 written on your description section. This means that this Blu Ray disc displays in full screen without the top and bottom horizontal black bars. To my frustration, this disc is a widescreen version with an Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1. I hate Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 because it doesn't display full screen. Your product description for this item is misleading. Please be more accurate in your product description. I really feel as if I wasted my money for an item i dislike in the first place.10,000 B.C. [Blu-ray]. Anyway thanks for updating the product info relating to the aspect ratio."
1,Sucks balls,Saw this with my sweety and even though it was fun to laugh at it was like laughing at a video of someone's coffin falling out of a hearse. Funny at first but in fact not funny.
1,Ruined Blu Ray for me.,"I only bought this movie because I didn't get to see it in theaters and thought it would be nice to see on Blu-Ray. Like most people, I thought this thing was so boring. The mish-mash of Native American grammar (white rain) and Klingon hunting rituals made this movie just dumb. Manny the Mammoth from Ice Age looked better than the mammoths in this movie. But that didn't ruin Blu-Ray for me. It was early on in the scene where the main character is telling the girl with the blue eyes about Venus. They lost me as soon as I saw that they didn't bother to clean up her eyes in post-production. You don't even have to strain to see the contact lenses she's wearing. He's wearing them too. Lost me...that's it."
1,Waste of time,"We have seen movies with this kind of story many many times. Bad guys captured the girl from a little village, and the hero went thru a tough time to get her back. Absolutely boring, too much talking, unremarkable special effects."
5,"10,000 BC impresses","I have read some negative buzz about this film, but believe most of it is unwarranted. Sure the movie is not realistic, and the actors speak in English. So what? The action is intense and the CGI scenes are very well done. A very nice action filled ride that will please fans of the genre. The excellent PQ is an added bonus to the outstandind visuals. Highly recommend this film!"
1,Leave This One Buried,"Bad, awful, terrible, dreadful, ridiculous...give me a moment while I break out a thesaurus! Just about everything that can be done wrong here is, except for maybe the CGI killer ostriches, which simply do not make sense anyway as they appear in the middle of a bamboo forest. Oooookay. Prepare to suspend ALOT of disbelief as the stilted dialogue (spoken in perfectly stilted English) drags us through a plot device we’ve seen 10,000 times before. Worse, this movie rips off everything from Last of the Mohicans to Rambo to Braveheart to Stargate (yes, even Stargate) and not in a remotely clever way. But, hey, they're cave people, right? What do they know about film making? The only thing that kept me awake through this epic disaster was to see if it could get any worse. It did, right ‘til the very end. If these were my ancestors, like a Bible literalist I'd be arguing that modern human beings popped out of thin air, too!"
2,Dissatisfied,"I'm sorry.**SPOILERS AHEAD**I really enjoyed this movie up to a certain point. I'm a romantic and when a movie projects itself as a romantic love story, I expect the best. I hate sad endings.A sad ending to me negates everything that came before and I feel like I wasted my time watching this film. I'll admit I didn't watch the last few minutes. I didn't care after the love interest was gone.Contrary to other reviews; good SFX, decent acting and forget the accents. Poetic license for crying out loud. Alternative history sideline was pretty cool. I enjoyed that. Almost felt like I was watching ""Stargate"" for awhile there.It just didn't work for me as a love story which, at heart, this is.Watch it but be warned."
2,Great trailers do not a great film make,"This film is the perfect example of how ALL the best moments were shown during the two to three minute trailer for the film. Looking for a awesome showdown between man and a sabretooth tiger? Don't look here for it. Looking for awesome fights between man and mammoths? Nope, not here either. What you will find is a drawn out, pretty boring scene that includes giant angry chickens and a lame plot with enough holes to drive a mack truck through. I'd rather watch paint dry than sit through this ""film"" a second time."
2,"10,000 BC","well to be honest, I'm a little upset with amazon, because I've seen any place to discuss a problem other than re-shipment of a product back to amazon. I purchased the DVD 10,000 B.C. and when I openened the movie case I discovered no movie, but a music DVD titled ""Opeth"" live at shepherds bush empire, in the 10,000 bc case.so I am actually pretty pissed about it and considering taking my biz elsewhere. Is there anyone doing quality control? customer service? customer satisfaction????????????????????. We will see how long it takes to recieve a reply about this."
4,"10,000 bc (umd for psp)",loved the movie.but i orderd a new movie and got a opened one with scuffs on it. was not happy about that. but i hate exchanging things from anywere. sometimes the nightmare is not worth it.
1,Atlantis?,"Ok. This movie is a real clinker. First, why are they building the damned pyramids in the first place? Second, what is the huge ship for? Then we have the (pre) historical inaccuracies...mammoths and smilodons in Africa? Also, who the hell are these pyramid builders? The inference from the dialogue and the rather modern looking map on the table is that they were supposedly from Atlantis. This whole thing is a mess."
3,No problem,Nice action motion picture. Negative points : a bit too long and a thin hair stretched writing !
3,10000 BC,"10,000 B.C. [Blu-ray]Movie is pretty good special effects okay Jurassic park much better, not as good as exspected."
1,Rivals Battlefield Earth...,"...in being quite possibly the most horrible, illogical movie ever made. Also, I wasn't aware that English was the language of cavemen, but judging by today's standards, I suppose that seems about right. Cleaning my cat's litter box is far more entertaining and enjoyable."
3,Fun Thrilling Movie,"I enjoyed this movie, it falls into my pretty darn good catagory, if I will watch it again I think it is pretty good, this is a movie I will watch again and again. great story line."
3,Good entertainment,"I thought it was a good flick to watch,nothing great and no more Historically wrong than a lot of other films.It was fun to watch,nothing more,no deep meanings or anything except good vs evil.There have been a lot worse movies made."
1,Anachronistic Festival,"I can't believe that the guy who did Stargate and Independence Day could put out this loser. First, the story line is a ripoff of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. Then, the constant anachronisms make it irritating to watch. 10,000 BC and you have guys riding horses and carrying metal swords. The Bronze Age was still a few thousand years away. Pyramid building in the age of the sabertooth and wooly mammoth! Yikes! I assume the story was taking place on the African continent because of all the African tribes; the heroes had to cross what looked like the Sahara desert, but at 10,000 BC the Sahara was a great big grassland. On and on these anachronisms went, so many that it was impossible to maintain the suspension of disbelief that is necessary to get into a movie. I'm willing to give a director dramatic license in order to make a good story, but in this case, he really abused it."
3,So-so film,"When I saw the previews, I thought this was going to be full of animals and action. They show the Saber tooth twice, terror birds once and the mammoths a few times. The rest of the movie is a mix of Pathfinder and Apocalypto. Though it is not what the previews lead you, it's still okay. They mix cave men withegyptian wannabe's (they are building pyramids). The plot is just a guy trying to get his girl back. Don't go into it expecting this great blockbuster and you will be okay."
2,what were they thinking??,"OK, I watched it. I was curious to see where things went so I watched it to the end. When it was over, I wished I had waited for it to come on television and not pay the rental fee.It has all the classic themes: good v/s evil; them v/s us; a group can conquer most things; love will survive. Hmmmm...The special effects were okay. The sabre tooth tiger could have been much better, but the mammoths and birds were great!What I didn't like: historically completely out of line with vast differences in dress, language and technology... and animals for that matter. I'm suprised a phone booth didn't pop up somewhere.The scenery was great, filming great, costumes I'm not sure about, music very good/appropriate. Acting was as good as it was gonna get.This movie should have been geared toward children, it would definitely suit them. It does have plot, action, special effects and a moral. Who cares if it's historically incorrect? It's entertainment... at least for kids."
2,Good to look at - but stiff.,"While covered in dung and dust - teeth and makeup remain essentially flawless. Yes, forget history, geography, etc. and go with the flow and its not half bad. The critter encounters - mammoths, giant birds and a sabertooth - are the highlights. The pseudo Egyptian civilization and the painting on a rock prophesy that ripples through to the end - not much use really."
4,If you are expecting this to be historically accurate don't watch it.,"Okay, if your part of the masses that believe every single movie that's made has to have some historical basis then you're going to be very disappointed.However, if you like to watch movies for the acting, for the effects and the suspence, romance and drama then this movie is great.Yes, they speak english, but not every movie has the budget of Apocalypto. Yes, they look the same as us, but again not every movie has a crazy budget. Some producers/directors are more into how they can make us relate to the characters.In todays world it's easier to relate if they A: speak the same language and B: look similar. Those things draw more people in.So, if you want to be drawn into a movie just because it's good then see this.If you're only watching it because you're looking for historical accuracy, don't bother, you'll be very disappointed."
1,Don't Judge a book by it's Cover.,"I went go see this movie thinking it would be a wild action ride of a movie like the preview made it out to be. I was wrong big time it was very slow and drawn out throughout most of the movie. Also I know it is a movie but it was just so historically innacurate. They had domesticated horses which weren't around until 4000 BC. The only animals domesticated back then were Dogs, Sheeps, and Goats. They also used hancuffs which werent invented until at least 1 A.D. if not later. The story is also riduculous. So I am just giving you a warning I never received this movie stinks. Spend your money on something better like Cloverfield or Charlie Wilson's War."
2,"D'Leh, we need to move","When I heard that line in the movie, I could only chuckle. By that point, I was bored to tears.You can make a movie with wild historical innacuracies. You can make a movie with bad actors. You can make a movie that defies the laws of physics. You can make a movie without a semblance of a plot. What you can't do is make it boring, and that is this movie's biggest fault. I was not expecting much from this film, either.I'm giving this movie one star, but an extra star for the digital copy. Of course, that's not a big deal for a movie this bad, but it is still my favorite special feature. I like to watch movies on the train or plane on my iPod; this is a welcome feature from the studios, and I hope it continues."
1,dont waste your time...,"what a dumb movie, thankfully I only wasted a dollar on the rental. Please do yourself a favor and pass on this really weak movie."
2,"10,000 BC","I was lucky I watched this movie after a friend had bought it, I did not buy it. Don't waste your money it isn't worth buying. The special effects are excellent but that is where it ends. The plot is absolutely stupid and make no sense."
3,Been done before,"This movie reminds me of Jurassic Park The Lost World and Apacalypto (spelling?) merged into one. It was some sweet action and an understandable story line, just as the movie progressed it lost its edge. Too much pride for nothing, if you ask me. I enjoyed it and wouldn't object to watching it again. Would I buy it, no. Is it worth the rent or if it's on TV, yes."
3,Not bad,"The good guys start off as good hunters but crappy fighters and end up as unbelievably good fighters with no interim/explanation; it doesn't seem consistent. And yes, it reminded me a lot of Apocalypto. In both movies the endings aren't very satisfying. But the ride to the ending in this one is fun; I can't argue with that."
1,Regret buying - headed to swapadvd this week,"I got the dvd yesterday with great anticipation. Emmerich's movies are always fun...until this one. Boring and shallow plot, bad acting, and the references to aliens and Atlantis are flat out dumb."
2,Bizarre.,"10,000 B.C. starring Camila Belle is a pretty dumb history film. Belle wears some freaky contant lenses in this film, no pupils ugh! The acting is very wooden and the animals were poorly represented. The ending is ok but this film will leave you scratching your head."
1,would not recommend,"this movie put me to sleep in the first 10 min.there were other parts that was confusing,i really did not get the whole movie,if you can not fall asleep put this movie in and i promise you will fall asleep"
2,ok review,ok movie but the acting and storyline are lite. Also the resemblance to the original classic is only coincidental. NOT worth the blu ray premium of price.
1,defective,"I had to request a replacement CD when the first one that was shipped stopped halfway through the movie. Also, most CD's are labeled, this one was blank! Not what was expected from Amazon."
2,Tribal Gathering,"Roland Emmerick who directed ""Independence Day"" creates another epic scale film with ""10,000 B.C."" Steven Strait who I enjoyed inThe Covenantdoes a good job as the lead D'Leh who goes in search of his lost love. While I fully enjoyedThe Ballad of Jack and Rosewith Daniel Day Lewis, I did not recognize Camilla Belle until I started looking at her credits. As Evolet, she is certainly the belle of the ball at this tribal gathering. Mona Hammond does a nice job as the Old Mother. New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis who was inFracture (Widescreen Edition)does well as the faithful Tic Tic. This film about the Yaghal tribe falls apart as the story becomes so farfetched. However, the cinematography made it pretty to look at. Two weeks after I saw the film, I struggled to recall much about it; so I think it probably is forgettable. Belle & Strait are worth watching. Taxi!"
2,Mostly atrocious,"This is, essentially, a terrible movie. No plot, cheesey CGI, and poor action scenes doom this to obscurity. The only saving grace (and hence a second star) is some of the landscape scenery, but even this is lessened by the characters jumping from snowy mountaintops to steamy jungle to arid desert in about 5 minutes of walking. Anachronisms abound, and even if you turn off your brain (a prerequisite for making it through the movie) it just isn't that good. The hokey happy ending sealed the deal and left all in attendance rolling their eyes. Give this one a pass."
2,"10,000 yawns!!",This movie was so boring. THe trailors for it made it SEEM like it had an interesting story line. NOT! Just plain boring.I was so glad when it was over. Can be viewed by the whole family but am not recommending it to be watched by anyone.
3,whatever,"People seem to get worked up about these things. This film is OK - there is action, pretty good characters, and a reasonably coherent story. I could watch it and do something else at the same time, kind of relaxing background entertainment. That's what it is.Now if you get into questions of accuracy, it is only marginally better than its reference predecessor, One Million Years BC. The saber tooths are too big and smart as are the monstrously huge predatory birds. Then there are the (proto?) Egyptians, who are 7000 years too early. But do we need to quibble? This is basic junk, however fun it is while I fill out my tax forms.Recommended within these limits."
4,Now that's what I call a knock out screenplay,"If anyone should read a good book, this is the book to read. I am the author of the book, and I guarantee you will not want to put this book down. This is too good. Lots of drama, and mystery. The main character is off the hook. I promise you will love this screenplay."
4,great for ovens,it may be a little too big for some jobs. I was able to clean a whole oven in less than 5 minutes. That included the racks!
3,They came with dust and grit all over them.,"The cellophane wrapper each brick was contained in were covered with dust and grit. A little dust I would not mind, but these were down right dirty, which I found a little annoying. But the product does work (at least it did on the stains in my bathtub)."
1,Dud Block,Probably has it's uses but doesn't respond/work anything like the adds say - probably great for the dead skin on my feet but didn't do squat for my bathroom/tile issues. Soap and scum won...
5,Old book with great information -,If you want a book with general flying information this is it! Some of the information is dated but the basics never change.
2,not much practical info for photographers,"I got this book looking for insight into glamour portraits, and there really isn't much here.I shouldn't be surprised, I guess. There are some nice sample images, along with more biographical information than I cared to read. I'm not sure who the audience is for this book, maybe fans of the man himself, maybe art or design students looking for some historical information?Nice photos, not much info on how to achieve the same in your own work."
5,Grieg,"This is extremely well played and recorded. ClassicalToday gave it it's highest marks, and for good reason. If you love the Holberg Suite, this is the definative recording (SACD)."
1,Not What I Expected,"I thought this would be a shower head replacement, but it is actually a shower head attachment to go along with your existing shower head. The worse part is that the water pressure is very weak with this unit. Not at all what I would expect from a relatively expensive attachment like this. I am usually more optimistic, but I just cannot recommend this product."
5,Spirit of the Harvest By Beverly Cox & Martin Jacobs,"Not only is this book visually beautiful, and educational -- it is the most outstanding collection of North American Indian recipes I have seen in a long time. I have been collecting Native American cookbooks for over 40 years. Spirit of the Harvest is a ""Keeper"". It is the jewel of my collection. The Hidatsa Stuffed Sugar Pumpkin (featured on the cover) will be the highlight of our Thanksgiving dinner this fall. I was an Adult Outdoor Trainer for many years, love to cook out over open fire. Many of these recipes will bring new smells and tastes to the camping experience, as well as to your kitchen. GREAT BOOK! GREAT FOOD!"
5,Excellent choice,"Book was excellent, covering a variety of indian groups across the entire country. Beautiful photography and well researched. Came quickly and in perfect shape. Totally satisfied."
4,the title says it all,"ms. rosnes is a fine pianist who seems to be overshadowed at the moment by players such as brad meldhau or jacky terrasson. this is unfortunate because she is gifted and plays with style that avoids some of the meandering of mr. meldhau and the identity crisis that seems to plague mr. terrasson. this album is titled ""art and soul"" and that is exactly what is presented. ms. rosnes alternates between hard bop explorations (""blues connotations"")and soulful blues (""with a little help from my friends"")that keeps your attention fixed and your fingers popping. the entire set swings hard and her approach, while complex, is not off-putting in any way. it's just fun, period. enjoy!"
4,A must have...,"I was truly impressed with this book. The illustrations, step by step instructions and ""trade secret"" sections of this book make this a ""unique must have"" no matter what your level of expertise. You can definitely obtain some great ideas to go to that next level. Hats off to the authors !!"
3,A very average book,"This book was a let down for me. I was looking for new ideas and inspiration. This contains the same old schlock. If you are looking for boring basics, it is a fine guide. Beyond that, don't bother."
1,Terrible!,"Needless to say, THE EXORCIST is among the great horror films of all time. But calling this book ""the full story of the film"" is a complete joke! As another reviewer has already pointed out, this book is essentially a transcript of the documentary ""The Fear of God,"" and it contains little original material and little insight into the making of the movie version of Blatty's book. What's worse, the author has an arrogant writing style that's completely baffling, considering his lame research skills."
5,It's a Great LCD,Cuando lo compre no estaba muy seguro pero es un buen monitor y en desempeño es bastante bueno se lo recomiendo es una opcion muy buena
1,do not mistake this for art film,"This is not avant-garde or artistic. It may be experimental, but to no productive end. Believe him when he calls it hardcore. Richard Kern takes advantage of the fact that Americans, in their schizo frenzy, will mistake this for something of social value when it was never intended as anything other than exploitation. I'm sure he had fun making these."
3,Overrated,"Some of the negative reviews of this DVD have stated that the porn and sleaze outweighs the other experimental and artistic value of the clips. This seems to be true; most of the films seem like punk trash porn with not enough substance. However, there are about 3-5 shorts including the Death Valley '69 and You Killed Me First that are actually somewhat good. For the rest it was just a headache to sit through. I was also expecting something more from Lydia Lunch, rather than playing the cliché punk rock slut over and over again."
2,I am amazed,"I am amazed at the insipid depravity that passes for art these days. I rented these latter-day underground films expecting to encounter Kenneth Anger-ish weirdness, yet I was greeted with poorly directed, uninteresting and rather pretentious pornography. Kern is the first person I have encountered that can actually put me to sleep with his films about rape and murder. I recommend this to anyone who would enjoy seeing Lydia Lunch disrobe every five seconds, anyone who wants to see..., anyone who is willing to sit through two hours of ""Film"" without encountering an original plot (where applicable) and anyone who is amused by shoddy acting and incompetent camera work. I gave it two stars because ""You killed Me first"" was moderately amusing."
1,DULL AMATEUR WORTHLESS UNARTISTIC HOME MOVIES,"The entire collection looks like somebody had nothing else to do so they got high and made some films for a joke. This is by no means art . It being released gives a bad name to independent film. To call it cheap would express some sort of aura so i can't do that ! It's more booring than a backyard barbeque shot by uncle Bob . I wish with all it's violence, sex & F words it would be at least disturbing ,but it's not.Some films are soo bad the're funny-NOT these . To put a adjective to this collection I would put the word "" NOTHING "". it should be retilted "" THE NOTHING COLLECTION """
2,You've got to be kidding...,"I'll give Kern an A for effort, but anyone with the technical know how and a few friends could've created this junk.It's a sad truism that those who have the know-how are usually the least suited to expressing themselves adequately or meaningfully.That makes this pornography pure and simple - sewage covered eye candy.If that is taken as a compliment (and it could be if Kern is honest with himself) it is one more sorry nail in the coffin of this struggling world."
2,Incomplete argument,"Note: The editorial review is citing the wrong author/wrong book.Winter answers the question of ""Did Jesus have to die on the cross?"" by citing the various theories of atonement, and showing that none of them give an explanation of exactly ""how"" Jesus' ""sacrifice"" on the Cross achieved salvation. Winters likens Jesus to Moses as an intercessor for the people. He concludes that the crucifixion, that of the Messiah being killed in such a humiliating way, overshdowed God's reconciling the world to himself through Jesus (as God and man) simply by asking for forgiveness for the sins of the world. It seems that there is a both/and that Winter is missing. The Cross takes too prominent a place in the Gospels to not somehow affect salvation. The question of ""how"" remains unanswered in this book."
3,A bit disappointing for me.,"I purchased this set in Bust Buy right after watching two episodes of THE FIRST WORLD WAR on the Military Channel. I did realize they were different programs, but this group of programs, although some are quite interesting, are not of the same quality of the other program set.These are episodes from various History Channel programs, such as Modern Marvels, which have been thrown together to make a box set. They do not cover the war start to finish, in a chronological fashion, as other sets do. For instance there is a program on the American Dough Boys and on on the German Ace, the Red Baron. It's very disjointed.I would recommend the ""World War One"" set narrated by Robert Ryan and ""The First World War - The Complete Series"". They are outstanding! Those sets provide an historical, chronological overview of the War in battles and effects on the Home Fronts."
4,Excellent collection of TV shows,"Not a chronology of the war, this is a collection of previously shown History Channel shows that delve into a wide variety of WWI topics. That makes it quite entertaining because you are not bogged down and can pick and choose what to watch and when without feeling guilty that you are skipping something. All the shows are high quality. Plenty of great footage. My only caveat is that many of the same WWI vets appear more than once in various shows, but, hey, there weren't many of them still around in the years when these shows were made."
1,Not Worth the Freight,"As Kirk M says, this is a cheap imitation of a documentary. The only thing that holds it together is the general subject matter. Save your money."
5,Going places,These guys are the newest and best in my opinion in the christian alt. and alt. music they are awesome if you ever have a chance to go to a concert let a lone get a cd then do it because they rock!
5,Very Entertaining....,"I was lucky to find and get this item. This includes great performances by such great ""Arista"" artists as Santana, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, Puff Daddy, Toni Braxton, etc. I did enjoy their live shows performing their #1 hit songs including Maria Maria/Smooth(Santana), I'll be missing you(Puff Daddy) and For You I WIll(Monica). It also was sweet to see Barry Manilow and Dionne Warwick singing. Mr. Manilow in particular was outstanding here. It brought me back to 70's and 80's with good memories.Between songs there were some footages about Arista hit songs during last 25years. I could see some of my favorite artists such as Air Supply and Eric Carmen. As I was so glad to see them, I thought their performances in full length should had been contained in this DVD.The picture and sound quality is great. The special features including extra live tracks are enjoyable. If you like to see live shows especially by Arista artists, you will enjoy this... always!"
3,Crazy Whitney,"I was at the live taping of this show at the Shrine in L.A. Although I've yet to see the DVD, I'm curious if they cut the part where Whitney begins her performance and almost trips and falls before recovering. To me it was pretty clear that she was on something. Can't quite remember if they had to re-shoot her opening or if it was edited out for the broadcast."
4,Good Show,"This a very good show. Highlights are Toni Braxton, Barry Manilow, Santana and Whitney Houston."
1,Not a safe table,"I am pretty certain that I originally ordered the table from these folks, and my order got switched to an Amazon storefront called unbeatables. Until proved otherwise, the table ships with an extra narrom base not as shown in the illustration. And, this base is simply not safe on a carpet, and is definitely not safe for chilren to use.The other possibility is that unbeatables operates on Amazon under several storefronts, and they switch to a fresh storefront without negative reviews when too many people catch on to their bait and switch operations on their previous storefront. That is the only way to explain how two of my orders ended up with them, when I remember distinctly not ordering from them the first Time."
1,"Beware, in my shippment, Freud had the wrong bit in the 50-501 package.","The item's packaging was correct ... the Freud 50-501 with top and bottom bearing. But, the router bit in the package only had the top bearing on it. I had to return it. Amazon was made aware of this. I ended up buying this bit elsewhere, where I could verify the package contents, and I expect this bit will be an invaluable addition to my workshop."
3,WTF?,"I have the exact opposite problem, I was hoping for a "" shank but got a quarter inch one instead with a piece of clear tubing around the shank. It will work but it is not what I expected or wanted."
3,beware: dual charging is sequential...,"The dual charger charges two batteries SERIALLY, one after the other. It's OK if you plan on recharging two batteries overnight, but won't work if you're planning on recharging two batteries in parallel before an event."
4,A must have with Nikon DSLRs,"Although it is true that the charger only charges one battery at a time, it does have something the standard charges does not - an indicator that lets you know when you are 80% charged. It is always best to have spare batteries, and to charge them once a month whether or not you've used them, just for increased lifespan. Have this set near my photo ""corner"" in the basement allows me to cycle through all of my batteries, and have 4 of them charged at all times (I bought 2 of these units). So it only charges one at a time... if you've let BOTH batteries expire, then perhaps you need 4. :) I like it, and would recommend it to anyone needing to have 2 or more batteries available to them at all times."
5,I love it!!,"I received this necklace for my birthday early in March and have worn it daily since then! It's beauitful! I've seen others, but they have been large and 'clunky'. Mine has 2 adults and 3 kids and it's still dainty and beautiful!Couldn't be happier!=-)"
3,"Bad Grammar, But still useful","This book sufferes from the same flaws that most Chinese textbooks do, it does not explain grammar and word usage enough, and when it tries to, it does so incorrectly. The grammar sections are worthless, the sentence pattern sections are okay, except that some of them never give the pinyin for the characters anywhere in the book, and some of the characters in the pattersns have more than one pronunciation. The texts also don't give the pronunciation of proper names, and such as ""Deng Xiaoping"" and ""Zhao Ziyang,"" whose Chinese rendition the students are unlikely to already know, if indeed they have heard of them at all. The tapes are a useful supplement, but they waste time and space by giving the pronunciation of each vocabulary and supplementary word (students who use this text should already know pronunciation) which could save time and maybe cost."
3,Interesting but not enough information and bad grammar.,"This can be helpful if used in a classroom setting, but it suffers from like most Chinese textbooks, giving incorrect grammatical explanations. In the texts it doesn't define proper names, which can be difficult because most intermediate or advanced students would not know names like Zhao Ziyang. The sections on grammar are worthless, and there should be more examples in the sentence pattern area. Still, it can be used somewhat effectively if you have a skilled teacher."
2,Nothing to write home about...,"This book is ""ok,"" I wouldn't go beyond that. The use of simplified and traditional Chinese is nice, but not necessary. My main complaints are that this book does not explain the grammar enough. Beyond this the lesson content is a bit over the top. The whole ""Deng Xiaoping"" argument in chapter two is a bit OUTDATED. This is not 1990. Also, there is a chapter where someone visits a monk to talk about love (Chapter 9). This book also gets so increasingly difficult once you hit chapter 8 its insane. This book might be alright for people that are learning 4th year Chinese and have a thorough understanding of Chinese grammatical principles for the three previous years. Also note- it has very UGLY illustrations, actually they are more ""hideous"" than not. Some of the lessons are helpful, but I don't think a student should use this book unless they have a vocabulary of at least 1200-1500 words PRIOR to starting this book."
1,Terrible book.,I found pronounciation errors in this book and some times they use the wrong character.
3,an indepth study of the path to enlightenment,"This book was written by me (AKA Jou/Joe Smith) after doing my Bachelor of Arts in Buddhist Studies, which I did after having been a Buddhist monk for five years, three of which were in meditation retreat.The book may be more suitable for those from the Theravada tradition and it questions some of the dogma about the path in that tradition. Some of that dogma may be found in other traditions, as they share basic teachings about the path.I have tried to look at the traditional teaching of the path with the attitude of keeping it simple, which means I had to admit contradictions and account for them."
1,Not for me,"Dry and doesn't stop acne, its a total waste of money and time but other products are good, just didnt work for me"
1,Does nothing,I was looking for an alternative but this product did nothing for me as a woman of color. I went back to proactive
2,"Okay, But Not For Me","This was my first time using a foaming cleanser and I don't care for it. I feel that I need to pump about 5 times the product just to feel like my face has been thoroughly cleansed. I'm not wild about the smell, either. And if you're a makeup wearer, you definitely need something stronger (even if you use makeup remover beforehand)."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A good wizard, a bad wizard, and a child, and a castle of power to be inherited. A climactic battle involving the former pair leads to the child being taken to Earth to survive. He grows up there, and eventually comes back and ends up battling for his heritage.The son, Pol, approaches this from a technological background, so there is a clash of magic and technology."
4,it wasnt to intresting,i thought this book was ok not the best had a unique goodness about it. The authors sentances Are paragraphs and made me fall asleep.
4,I am dumbfounded by this video's lack of attention here,"Victoria is my absolute favorite playboy playmate of all time. Playboy videos are thier best when the model appears 100% comfortable about being nude on camera. Victoria is 110% confortable. She acts as though she is sporting a three piece suit when she is wearing only a smile, and that is stupendous!My only complaint here is that it follows the typical MTV rock video format, with the playmate dancing and posing naked to music. I wish that playboy would have thier playments doing one of the interview segments nude. Or, even better, she could be nude during one of the interview segments alongside clothed members of her family! Sitting there in the buff talking to a clothed mom and sister about when she was a little girl. It would be both funny and sexy at the same time! Naturally, they would have to find a way to show us everything while doing it. PLAYBOY TAKE NOTE: TRY THIS PLEASE!"
3,Victoria Silvstedt alone kept this video alive,the video was very poorly put together. The music in the video just did not come up to par. The only good thing about this video was Victoria Silvstedt. I have seen good Playboy Videos and this is definitely not one of them. I wish Playboy would have given a little more effort to the video of one of their greatest Playmates of all time!
4,A must-have for serious jazz collectors!,"This retrospective contains every Horace Silver track you have heard as well as many you may hear for the first time. Rudy Van Gelder has done an excellent job of re-mastering each track providing the listener with 40+ year old tracks that sound as if Horace cut them last night!As usual, there are the occasional tracks that make you say, ""Why on earth did they bother to include that??"" However, overall, this compilation is a must-have for any serious fan of Horace Silver."
4,"Very nice, but one drawback",This is a very good product with one exception; the outside sensor unit needs to be in the shade and IN A DRY PLACE. Just try to find a place that will always be dry outside. Should be waterproof.
2,To Busy,"I sent this item back because it's display was so busy with the resultant small size of the digital display that I had to get right up to it to see the reading. I was most interested in inside temp and outside temp and wanted to be able to glance at the device from half a room away and make out the reading. For me, less was better."
3,As advertised...,Easy to set up and does what it's supposed to do. Only complaint is that it was missing the adhesive tape that the instructions said were included.
3,"OK Weather System, but small fo rthe money","The product works ok, but they are really small compared to the picture. Everything has seemed to work, but I could have gotten a bigger and bigger one from our mall. Make sure you check the size before you buy. Probably would not recommend."
4,Great price-bought as a gift,"Bought this as a Christmas gift, but have other porducts made by the same co. and they are great. The price I paid resulted in about a 50% savings."
5,LaCrosse weather station,Have had a station for about two years and love the forecasts and ability to watch outside temps. The atomic clock is good too. Would recommend it.
2,Thinking about returning.,"Inside data could hardly be true~! Disappointed. Just wanted an easy, but accurate device. Oh well, ho, ho, ho! JFC"
1,Temp Wrong,"This product does not read the correct temp. no mater how close it is set to the other part of the unit. I fallowed the direction for the set up several times but that is not the problem, it just does not work correctly. I have sent the company several e-mails and they have never gotten back to me. So I am asuming that they also think their product is a piece of junk."
4,La Crosse Weather Station,This product works great. the only little downfall is that the forcast feature is not very accurate. This is well worth the money.
4,Simple and inexpensive,"I bought this station about 6 months ago. It was very easy to set up, and has been working perfectly ever since. Having one reliable atomic clock in the house is useful, as all appliances drift somewhat, and so do mechanical watches. The wireless remote temperature sensor has also been working reliably. I just placed in under a bench on the deck, and it has survived so far (in the wet Seattle climate).Also, the station has a memory for highest/lowest temperatures (one for the station, one for the remote sensor), which is nice when you want to know exactly how hot/cold it got last night.I haven't been using the weather forecast much, so I won't comment on it.I still haven't had to change the batteries (almost 6 months of use by now).Altogether, I'm very happy with the purchase (less than $35), and would recommend this unit to anyone looking for an inexpensive atomic clock/temperature sensor combo."
1,Great when it works,After ordering this product I read reviews that the exterior transmitter worked only for a short period of time and that a replacement cost as much as the entire unit. Should have paid attention to the reviews and canceled the order. Mine lasted about 80 days. A piece of junk and waste of money.
1,LaCrosse termometer,We had a remote thermometer. Some of us live far enough North that the temp drops to -20deg.. This thermometer stops reading at that temp. When I ask what could be done they said we were on our own .don't bother with them there not worth it.
4,Indoor/Outdoor Weather Monitor,"This item is as it was listed to be...A little hard to get the outdoor tempature to read a little tricky but finally got it going. Both parties that it was gifted to, really enjoy it."
4,Great gift for dads,"It took awhile to get set up, but it was well worth it. My stepdad loves the weather station I got him for Christmas."
5,Love it,"This is a wonderful weather station that can do both celcius and F. I come from Europe so it matters a lot to me that I can do both. What drives me nuts though is that the weather pressure only comes according to American measurements: inches of mercury in comparison to millimeters of mercury. Inches of mercury do not make sense at all for me. Aside from that the measurements are very accurate. I like the features of rain/cloud/sun for weather forecast. It does not only show that it might rain but also it shows that low atmospheric pressure might give me a headache. It is perfert for a baby room for humidity and room temperature. I could not figure out the clock, so I had to change the zones manually. For some reasons it did not set up appropriately. Overall it's a good price for this gadget, I got it a few years ago and it was way more expensive. I highly recommend this product. Just make sure the piece that goes outside does not get missing."
2,Not worthy.....,"This weather forecaster does not provide accurate information. I had a much larger more expensive La Crosse, but it fell and broke. It was great until then, but was more than $100., so I thought I'd opt for the deal being offered in the gold box for this smaller version. The only bright spot is that it was offered for less than $20.00.The time, date, and day work, but I have a clock and calendar for that. Definitely not worth purchasing. I would get the larger version again, if it wasn't so easily toppled (needs a sturdier stand than what comes with it.)"
3,Weather forcaster,"All but one function works well and that is the ""forecaster."" It seems to be over sensitive to very slight barometer changes-thus giving erroneous forecasts."
1,Doesn't work,Received this as a gift. No instructions and no tape for remote in box. Stand for table top was already attached. Does not receive signal for atomic clock. Looked like it was a return that someone just sent out again.
3,If you have trouble setting this up,"The instructions provided will refer you to the ""detailed setup"", which is not in the little booklet. Check here: [...]This will cover the detailed setup. Took me a while to find it, so I'm adding it here in the hope I will save the next guy some time.Addendum: ;ooks like Amazon kindly removed the url. Not helpful. Go to Lacross Technology's website, and search for the product manual. The number is on the side of the box. You will find the incomplete manual. The search for ""complete setup instructions"" on their site. You will find a more helpful manual for a different model, but it will be close enough to get you going."
4,helpful,"It seems to be as accurate as the local TV forecasts and is great to know what the out side temps are right outside my front door instead of at the local airport, 20 miles away...."
1,keeps losing contact with the base,"Must have tried 20 times to get the base to connect with the remote units. works for a day or so, then nothing, no data from remote units. Have an LL Bean unit from Lacrosse that also works fine. returning it. Junk."
1,Works for 3 days,This thing sucks. It only tells you the temp inside just like most of these things. Not worth the buy unless it never rains or snows outside in your area.
1,Not Happy,We do not recommend this product. The only thing we have been able to get to work correctly is the outside temperature.
4,Weather station,"La Crosse Technology WS-7014CH-IT Wireless Weather StationI purchased four of these weather stations as Christmas gifts, and was able to program them quite easily before presenting them. They seem to be quite correct, and a good gift. Also they're relatively small and attractive when placed at the convenience of the receiver."
3,It serves the purpose,"I bought this item along with the other La Crosse weather equipment offered in the bundle. I was never able to get it to accept three signals, however by using both receivers I was able to read the signals I needed. I wanted to read the temperature in my garage, on my unheated back porch and also outside as well as in the house. While the readings are not always consistant even when the meters are right next to each other, they are close enough that they meet my needs."
3,Christmas Gift,Gave this weather station as a Christmas gift. Make sure you follow the directions and it will work great!
4,Works fine,"Only complaint I have is that the batteries fall out of the display unit very easily if it is tipped over. Then you have to go out side, get the remote sensor, take the batteries out, let both units sit for 5 minutes, put the batteries back in the remote sensor, then back in the display unit, then wait 5 or 10 minutes until the unit syncs back up with the remote sensor and the atomic time sets.Besides that, it works great. Very handy having an atomic clock and knowing how cold it is out side.I've only had it for about a month so far. The weather prediction doesn't seem very accurate, it changes from forecasting cloudy to sunny with in an hour. Maybe the cold weather is throwing it off."
3,Small,"I bought this product for my husband for Christmas and was very surprised when it arrived. It is much, much smaller than I had thought. Otherwise, product seems to work fine."
3,Maybe not...,"Bought this for the indoor outdoor thermometer. Sleek looking design, but all the extras, maybe not worth the extra $. Couldn't set the correct time (kept adjusting to something else?) and the LCD doesn't light up. This one is getting returned. The accu-weather station is more fun if you are into the weather predicting/forcasting."
1,Did Not Work,"Purchased this for a friend's Christmas. He opened it, put in the batteries, and some of the lines on the numbers did not work. Very embarrassing, I had to take my gift back so I could replace this. Now I have to order a new one (late) and return the old one. Do not buy this."
2,Crappy customer service from LaCrosse,"This was a birthday gift for my 60-something mother who lives several states away. After she followed the setup instructions, the outside temp would not display on the unit. She tried all troubleshooting techniques available, to no avail. So I had her send me the unit thinking it was user error, but alas, I could not get the outdoor temp to display either. So I sent an inquiry through LaCrosse's warranty website, and it took them several days to respond. They had me go through similar troubleshooting techiniques, and then told me to ship the unit to them...at my cost! One week later I received the unit back indicating the sensor was bad and they had replaced it. No apology. No sorry for the inconvenience. No refund of my shipping cost. I will never buy anything from LaCrosse again...what crappy customer service. Now two months after my mom's birthday I will pay again to ship it back to her."
2,Stopped working after about 9 months,"I purchased this La Crosse Indoor & Outdoor Digital Thermometer from another warehouse retailer. It had some nice features (indoor and outdoor temperature, weather forecaster and atomic clock). Unfortunately, the outdoor features (except for the atomic clock) stopped working after about 9 months. When it worked, I found it reasonably accurate but many of the features were non-functional within a year."
4,Great gift!,Received this as a Chirstmas gift and my daughter commented that she would like one so I ordered from Amazon as a birthday gift. Nice that it can sit on desk or counter.
3,Works for indoors....,"The unit works well for indoor temperature and humidity measurements, but the outdoor transmitters are of very poor quality. I've tried two and they both stop working below 32 degrees F, despite the fact that they are supposed to measure much lower. This also appears to me a common problem according to other reviews. Considering that it's just a plastic desk clock with a temp/hum reading, it's way over priced."
3,no customer service from manufacturer,I received this unit as a gift( bought from Amazon by my daughter)after listing it on my wish list. After getting it set up and working I installed the outside sensor in a protected location on my deck and within no more than twenty five feet from where I had stationed the station. It worked fine for a day ---until the outside temperature really dropped---then the sensor started sending all sorts of weird readings ranging from 0 degrees to 134 degrees and somehow 77 degrees most of the time despite the actual outside temps ranging from low single digits to about 34 degrees.Several emails to Lacrosse resulted in three form email replies none of which even suggested that they read my emails.I am very disappointed with the manufacturer. The product could probably be just a little better designed to correct this fairly common problem without dramatically increasing it's modest price.
5,La Crosse Technology Wireless Weather Station,"This is an easy-to-program weather station that gives us all the important information about our weather. It's easy to read, and the station is very nice looking (in addition to all the good technical stuff)."
2,Unreliable and eratic,"The Unit worked properly for the first six months, and then the alarm started going off for no apparent reason. This was especially annoying at 3:00 in the morning. After reseting the entire unit, it worked for awhile and then began acting erratically once again. There have been times I wanted to throw the whole thing away, but I have persisted. The outdoor transmitter stopped working - even with a reset and battery replacement of both units. This makes the whole unit somewhat useless, since I really want to know the temperature outside. Craftsmanship is mediocre at best, but looked good initially with the wooden face plates, but after 6 months of use (sitting there), the veneered wooden layer started peeling off. It has been a disappointment. I realize it was not the ""top of the line"" unit, but it wasn't the bottom line unit either. I just wish I could find a unit that was durable and had some longevity."
2,"Good thought, poor execution","We were excited to have this product but we just couldn't keep it working. We had to replace the batteries extremely frequently, and had a hard time getting it to work properly when it did have batteries. We ended up buying a different brand as a replacement and that one has been working fine and doesn't need batteries anywhere near as often."
5,Good Product,This was a gift for my husband. He really enjoys knowing the weather outside and in. Was diffently a good gift for him.
2,Works OK for a while,"I wish this unit worked better, since it is nice looking. The so-called automatic clock never worked, and the user interface is not intuitive. Believe me, I tried. This is one product that you must keep the manual for. I gave up, it stays set at another time zone.But what do I need a clock for? I really just want the temperature. That worked for quite a while, but recently the sensor stopped working. And I'm not buying another one of these."
2,Works great until it doesn't and batteries die very quickly.,"This unit was easy to setup and worked great in the beginning. However, the batteries in both the remote sensor and the base unit die VERY QUICKLY. I was replacing batteries every month it seems, until I finally gave up. This thing is garbage. I have an older ""Weather Channel"" unit as well, and the batteries in that last a year."
1,didn't work,I purchased the weather station early in the month and it seemed to work fine. As the month went by the temp. were more and more off. By theend of the month the temps. were 10 to 15 degrees off. I sent it back.Amazon took it no problem. That was good. jerry
2,Weaather Station,"Weather paart works well but the ""time"" clock does not work - minutes OK hour wacko random Must look up manual on the web but it doesn't make the hour part of the clock work correctly"
3,Liked old one better,"This unit does a good job, but is lacking a backlight and an alarm,both of which were included in my old model, which unfortunately stopped giving temperature readings. It's nice to check the time or temp in the dark and I really used the alarm clock. I had assumed these features were included with this similarly looking and similarly priced unit. The display is also smaller than my old unit. All in all, a downgrade from my last unit. I expect more from la crosse, who otherwise have a nice product here."
4,Weather Station,"I was very pleased with the price and the value of this station. I've owed many over the years, and this one also looks the nicest. Very handsome wood looking trim. Also love the ICONS that predict future weather trends based upon pressure. I'll buy this one again, and recommend it as a perfect Christmas gift."
4,So far so good!,"This is the second unit like this I have bought.The other one lasted about 6yrs. This is very much the same,so far so good.Very accurate."
1,A DEFECTIVE DESIGN,"After six months, this product ceased to function at all. I went through two or three dozen battery set replacements and careful resets, as the function degraded, until it now ceases to work at all. Do not buy this product! Since it took too long to break down, Amazon's return policy makes it impossible to obtain a refund. Take a look at all the one-star reviews, many of which remark on the lack of durability. What a gyp!"
5,Complete easy to read weather/time/date station,"I bought this for my aunt who struggles with remembering the date. She can clearly see the outside and inside temps, as well as the date and humidity. It does not display the year or day of the week."
2,It can only pick up the signals of two remote temperature sensors,"I have three remote outdoor sensors and followed the instructions to add them with the weather station.But I could only get two channels working. The third channel (the number '3' in a square box) never shown up.I know all the sensors were working because I had rotated them as 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sensors.Each time the weather station could read the temperatures from the first two senors only.Has anyone really made all the three channels working? I would change my rating to this product if I could make thethird channel working."
5,Love it!,We wish we had two receivers (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) but that isn't really a criticism. We also used it to help diagnose our refrigerator issues.
1,Never even turned on at all,"The Weather Station looked a little less sturdy than I was expecting when it arrived. Despite trying 3 different sets of brand-new batteries, we could not get the screen to turn on. Repeated attempts to contact the manufacturer via their website were unsuccessful. Returned the item to Amazon and received a quick refund for the defective item. Would not recommend this item."
5,Installed This Device in an RV...,"and it has worked very well so far. I also ordered some spare remote sensors just in case the external sensor that I mounted on the outside of the RV blows off, breaks or gets stolen."
3,Replaced One That Died,"A little small, have to be pretty close to read the display. The one I replaced (also La Crosse) was much larger. However, it works well and easy to set -up."
3,LaCrosse Technology Weather Station Not That Easy To Set Up.,"This is a fine instrument, but it is very sensitive, and not all that easy to set up. You must use batteries that are at least 10 years from expiration, and the unit is sensitive as to where it is place. It cannot be near anything electronic, including a cordless phone. In addition, there must not be multiple walls between the indoor unit and the outdoor sensor. Placed the outdoor sensor in this different areas of the house before it finally worked. Also had to contact LaCrosse Technology phone and email support to get the unit working. Once the unit is working it is responsive to both indoor temperature and humidity and outdoor temperature, but the instructions must be followed not only to the letter, but far beyond. Before purchasing, the buyer should check LaCrosse Technology Support on their website to be sure they know what they are getting into."
4,Fast Delivery,"It as all the Functions that I needed, but the display was just a little to small, it needs to be six inches taller and the screws that are provided for the outside sensor are worthless should provide double sided tape, screws just strip."
3,IT ALWAYS RAINS IN SEATTLE!!,"So....I bought this thing during the winter months in Seattle.... hooked up the batteries and followed all of the gobble-de-gook instructions...and <SHAZAM!>...it's working. Temperature, check. Date, check. Time, check. It's raining cats and dogs... and I know it's true, because my weather station from La Crosse, says so! So there!But, whoa, wait a minute.... it's July 5th...and finally...finally the sun is out here in Seattle! Summer is here!! No more 50' weather!! Yet, my La Crosse handy-dandy weather station says....clouds and rain??The rest of the gizmo's look to be honest and true, 'cept the forcast part. :(Oh well...no sense in contacting customer support...as they never answer anyway. Guess they are busy in the back figuring out why the forecast thingy doesn't work very well.."
4,a little small . . .,"i know they give you the dimensions on amazon but it was much smaller than a similar looking one i bought a few years ago. the numbers are hard to read because they are small. a light would help too so you could see the display in dim light. overall, it looks good and works well. i'll probably buy something else though with a bigger display."
1,Beware,"I bought this product without fully researching it.First of all the initial setup up procedure is difficult and takes about 20 minutes.The batteries in the base unit lasted slightly less than 2 months.Then to my consternation, I discovered after installing new batteries all data is lostand you need to run the entire initial set up procedure again which means bringing the remote and base unit close toeach other for at least 15 minutes hence the 20 minute set up time.There should be a better way"
5,AWESOME WEATHERSTATION,"THE LACROSS TECHNOLOGY WS-7014CH-IT WIRELESS FORECAST STATION IS AWESOME!!!WE HAVE OWNED OTHER WEATHERSTATIONS, BUT THIS ONE PROVIDES ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED IN AN ELEGANT LOOKING PRODUCT!!!!"
1,its ok...but that's about it.,"The numbers are too tiny. it does not have outdoor humidity gauge, the forecast is not all that accurate since what shows on the display is not what happens outside. i think the temp was accurate though.the buttons are pretty much useless. when i first started it took a few hrs to adjust. the instructions are a waste too.returning it. will get another one."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this item a couple of years ago to replace a unit that we loved. I thought the wooden frame made it look really nice. The problem is the numbers are so small that you have to be right on top of it to read the outdoor temperature. Now, the outdoor gauge has died and I am going to replace the whole thing with a new unit with larger numbers. This one looks nice, but is not well designed for the most important purpose of the unit - the outside temperature information."
1,Much smaller than expected don't be mislead by the picture.,"I own two La Crosse weather stations that I bought years ago and are wonderful, this one I bought as a gift, from the picture it looked just like the ones I own. But this one is a tinker toy compared to the original model. Get out your glasses you'll need them. Check the dimensions it's really small. The picture makes it look like the original. Buyer be aware."
1,Don't waste your money,"I returned this product.I followed the ridiculous and poor instructions on this device for installation to the letter.Temperature and humidity readings ,very inaccurate. The atomic clock feature did not work to update the date and time from my location."
2,Outside Temp runs high,"I have the external thermometer placed outside on my deck in the shade. I think it runs aprox 5-6 degrees high though, when I check the weather online vs what the unit is reporting. Set up was easy, and the external thermometer syncs easily with the internal unit."
2,Wireless Weather Station,Works great but I should have looked for the size specifications very small for the price.
2,weather or not review..,"This item was too narrow in viewing for our choice. We really had to view closely to read and not be distracted by the frame. Of course, us old folks like to see the ""big picture"" on everything!"
1,Smaller then I thought,When I looked at this item on line I didn't notice anywhere the size of this Wireless Temp Station. It would be great on a desk.. but it was alot smaller then I thought it would be .. for 7 lbs. It doesn't weigh 7 lbs. I wasn't happy about it and will either return it or go to a local store and purchase one. Be careful what you buy.. try to look up the deminsions or you will be dissappointed as I was.
4,Wireless weather station,I enjoy being able to see the outside temperature in several selected locations. I also am pleased with the automatic time setting and its accuracy.
5,LaCrosse Technology WS-7014CH Wireless Weather Station,Neat little gadget for less than $50. Simple to setup and works great.
5,Great Temp Device,20 words is a big dwmand for a porduct review. Well here goes.Install and preped easily Gives great readings as expected from a product of this type.Movement of the in house (base unit) is trichy as I got out of renge quickly but returning into the range the device erconnected with the sending unit.Like it a lot.Meed to get on linr to set the unit to PST. It came in EST.
1,Remote sensor doesn't work,"Similar to other reviews, the remote sensor doesn't work. I ended up buying an Oregon Scientific which works fine."
1,A Poor Product - Don't buy it!,"We had this temperature device for less than one month before the outsidetemperature sensor failed. It was about 15 feet from the weather station itself, separated by one wall. It was protected from rain - sheltered from wind but still failed. After trying all that was suggested, we could not get the sensor to work. About two weeks ago, I called AND e-mailed La Cross requesting technical support and have had absolutely no response to date. This is the 2nd La Cross wireless weather station we have had. The first, more expensive but no longer in their inventory, worked well for a couple of years before it ceased to provide time and date and inside temperature. We will buy another weather station but it will not be one from La Cross Technology."
4,Pretty good,We are using the indoor unit with a lacrosse transmitter we already have installed. We have one transmitter and two receivers currently working together since we wanted to know the temperature from two different locations in our house. The old transmitter and receiver worked great and this receiver works fine. With both receivers we have had a problem if it backs up against anything else (namely don't wall mount or put near a wall) or in front of a radio.
2,Troglodyte inspired firmware,"Received Ls Crosse Technology WS-7014CH-It in sealed box. Not only was the sensor and receiver jumbled in the box, but, even with the use of a high powered magnifying glass, I could not find real programming instructions. Quick start instructions were included. Useless. Had to go online to manufacturer's website and drill down, way down, to find the instructions to program the receiver. Much to my chagrin the receiver changes to the next date at noon despite the use of modern technology such as ""Atomic Time"". So it is a half day ahead. Which makes it temporarily useful for ascertaining current date somewhere in the Pacific. For part of the day. Now when I look for the weather I use mental prestidigition to ignore the date of today's weather."
1,Sort of worked- for only 6 weeks,"I ordered this so we could see what the temp outside was so we could dress appropriately for outdoor activities in the winter. Have very few good things to say about it, so I'll start right in with the downside:1. Setup is a pain2. Remote sensor/transmitter quit working after 2 weeks. Changed the batteries and went through entire setup process again3. Outdoor temp numbers are very small4. No backlight- impossible to read is dim light5. Outdoor sensor quit working again this morningNow, the sensor is in a sheltered location on our garage, facing the receiver/display unit through a glass window and about 60 feet away. Brought the thing inside and laid it next to the receiver- it started working. Great! So, as a test I moved it just outside the front door, about 6 feet away- stopped working again. I'm disgusted with this thing. I don't want to have to change the batteries because setup is a chore. I'm outside the Amazon return window, so in the trash it goes!"
4,Nice thermometer!,"I'm still trying to figure out how to program it correctly though - seems a bit difficult to get the correct time set, but I'm working on it! It seems pretty accurate though, and it's a good deal for the money."
1,Defective,"I had one of these units that I received as a gift a few years ago. When it quit displaying the outdoor temperature, I couldn't get it to work again. As I had been satisfied with it for a good time, I opted to get another one like it. I received it it a timely manner but it wouldn't communicate with the remote. I tried all the suggested fixes on LaCrosse's web page to no avail. I then sent them a message about the problem. They acknowledged receipt of the message and had forwarded it to the support group who would be contacting me in a ""timely manner"". That was eight days ago. Since I hadn't heard from them I returned the unit yesterday for a refund.When I tried to call them I got a message that I could expect a long waiting time and would get a faster response by sending them the message on line!!"
5,It's great,"The wood tone color is outstanding .The information is always correct. Very easy to set up. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a indoor ,outdoor digital thermometer"
1,Waste of Money,Either the transmitter stopped transmitting after two months or the receiver stopped receiving. Lacrosse website totally ineffective and the customer service department did not return calls We tried to reach them for more than a month. Very poor quality with NO customer support in case of defects. My only option is to return to Amazon for a partial refund. This item was a gift. Very emabarassing to send such a shoddy piece of merchandise. Don't waste your money.
4,Depend On It,"This is a replacement for my new La Crosse last Christmas (only 5 months ago) .. which was a replacement for one about 2 yrs old. In each case the outdoor sensor just quit!!! Have come to rely on the weather station though, so have taken another chance. Like my previous model better than this one...oval shape and larger numbers..but love that this one reads indoor humidity. Sure wish it also read outdoor humidity. Just put the batteries in the outdoor unit, then the indoor unit and presto...works without doing anything else. It's best to start it up at night as that's when it grabs the Greenwich Mean time & date via satellite. Handy little gadget and next time the sensor gives out I'll get just the sensor. Amazon is so great to order from."
2,You need a college degree to set the various settings.,"It's small, attractive, and works well. That is if you can get the settings correct to begin with. I had to have help. One read instructions, the other pushed buttons. It took us over an hour to get the time, date, etc. set. The time is now incorrect for a reason that I do not know. Neither my friend or I will dare to reset the time and risk having to set everything else again. The temperature seems to work really well and so do the icons that say whether the weather is improving, getting worse, or staying the same. So if you have a college degree you might like it."
4,PROUD IN PENNSY,"IT WORKS WELL SO I GUESS THATS ALL THATS IMPORTANT, I WAS JUST THAT THE SCREEN WOULD BE LARGER"
2,Worked for a short time,Received in perfect condition and worked fine for a week. Then the time display froze at 2:00 am. Re-inserting the batteries didn't help as the time / date would not update to the atomic clock for 5 days. I returned it. :(
1,Do Not Buy,I have purchased two of these stations. Within a year the outside tempature function stopped working on both. I changed the sensor but the problem is in the base unit and it not fixable.
2,Not very accurate,The temperature for both the outside and inside readings were on average @2-4 degrees high. It has a nice appearance design.
1,terrible customer service,I got this for christmas. Could not get indoor readings. Followed the instructions rebooted still no help. emailed them twice. called the cust. service numer NO ANSWER wondering if they went out of buisness
2,NOT any good in a greenhouse application!,"I bought this thermometer to use in our Solar Gem greenhouse. However, aboveabout 80 degrees it's not even close to being accurate! Up to 80, it's just fine,and the outdoor sensor seems fine (below 80 - it's not that hot here now, so whoknows what it'll do then). When the interior of the greenhouse is 85-90F (as verified by 2 otherthermometers, both of which agree), this unit registers 107!! I won't bother sendingit back, as it's still useful for humidity and outdoor temps, as well as the timeI guess... but I had to add a different thermometer for getting an accurate readinginside the greenhouse. A $3 bargain kitchen dial thermometer from the grocery storeis VASTLY more accurate for my purpose.I wouldn't buy it again had I known it's so wacked out above 80F."
4,Good but with problem,"It's certainly a good price and it was delivered promptly...but I've had a problem getting the outside station to send teh right temperature. We've had another indoor/outdoor thermometer for years and it's accurately shown us temperatures but the new Lacrosse thermometer consistenly gives us a 5-7 degree higher reading for the outside temperature! Customer service put me through the paces of checking it out before saying they would send a replacement...about 2 weeks ago! Haven't heard from them since! Even though I indicated that I would wait to receive the replacement before sending back mine, in case they only sent part of the unit.NOTE: they came through in the end and now I have the system up and running beautifully!"
2,Outdoor sensor quit working too soon,"I purchased a La Crosse WS-7014CH-IT Wireless Forecast Station. It worked perfectly for about 4 months, at which point the sensor that was supposed to receive the outdoor temperature quit working. And, the problem was definitely with the inside receiver as a second (cheaper) La Crosse indoor/outdoor thermometer located elsewhere in my home continues to work, providing both inside and outside temperatures. This meant that the sending unit placed outside the house was still sending a proper signal. The problem is with the inside unit. And, it is not a battery problem, as I replaced them and it still did not work.If you check out many other reviews, you will see this is a common problem. I would not buy another La Crosse unit.JMR"
1,No customer service,Worked for about a month after purchasing. Then outside temperature display quit working and unit locked up. After resetting will work for about four days and then do the same thing. Sent two emails to La Crosse and received no response. Their website says they are busy because of the Christmas rush. It is now June.
4,Nice product!,This is the third product I have purchased from this manufacturer and it is nice looking and works great. The only flaw with the product is the size it is to small and I would never recommend it for anyone that is over 50 and needs reading glasses you can barely read it unless you are 2 inches from it to read it. Besides that problem I would say very well built I will just read clooser the size of the product since the picture makes it look much bigger and that is my fault for not looking clooser at the description of the product. As they say live and learn and I have for sure!!
1,Junk,"I've bought at least 5 of La Crosse's weather stations. They all don't work after a short period of time. Here I am this morning trying to fix 2 that my mother has. Same old problems, and there are a lot of them. Personally, I recommend staying away from all the products this company makes. Their product support is a joke."
4,Works Well,"After many attempts to get the display to work properly I ended up sending it back to LaCrosse. They sent me a new display and it works fine. I ended up paying for the shipping even though it should have been their responsibility due to the defective product. They also treated me like an idiot over the phone while trying to fix the problem. I gave this a four star rating based on how it works now, not on the problems that I had with the first unit. Had I just given up on that one I would have given it one star, or less."
2,Temperature displays too small,I purchased this item to replace a similar weather station that stopped working. I returned it because the temperature displays were small and hard to read when further than a few feet from it. I bought it as a temperature gauge and the largest display was that of the clock. It did work correctly aside from the problem above.
4,Nice Weather Station,Very nice little weather station. Inexpensive but looks expensive. Works well and I would reccommend it.
4,Good product for price,I purchased this unit as a gift since the one we had worked so good. It is an attractive unit and very functional.
4,Wireless Forecast Station,"""Took me a while to get this thing set up correctly, but I finally did, and am really enjoying it. Recommend it highly!"
1,I was foolish enough to believe this book!!,"Unfortunaty, I was also naive enough to believe that the book was nonfiction, but it was a BIG dissapointment when I joined the Energetic Matrix Church of Consciousness and found that I didn't have any of the expieriences he talks about in the book. My only expierence was being ($) more poor. I feel the book is totally fiction."
2,Nancy in Washington,"The beginning of this book I found to be interesting, and thought it was touching on truths of energy as the key ingredient that modern medicine has forgotten over the past 100 years. I ended up thinking the book was more an info-mercial than true helpful information. Personal experience with energy workers and extensive reading has lead me to believe that our energy is a key to health, though thinking that a photograph and computer can get the work done seems EXTREMELY far fetched to me. On the subject of karma the book really turned a wacky direction in my estimation. I am still confused that it is recommended by some nationally recognized speakers that seem to have lots of good words to share.(?) Life is for learning! (and funny)"
2,I always enjoy a good story!,"Entertaining story about a ""scientist"" who adjusts everyone's energy through his computer. Somehow, this bit of fiction is the basis for a very big business based on Energy Balancing of your photograph. Those who are helped by this should rather understand the great power of their own minds in this process and that the story should not to be taken seriously (as all the disclaimers imply). If, as in the story, your photograph can be used to change your health, what if he gets it wrong or choses to use this for harm? Can he kill you or make you grow a third leg or go crazy? From now on, you'd better be careful with your photo album. Just think if one of your pictures gets damaged or fades!"
1,How many times?,"How many times can you tell someone that they don't understand what you aren't doing? Apparently, enough times for the authors to fill 225 pages. My well being would improve immediately if I could just have back the time I wasted trying to find out if there was a point to this noodling nonsense. Mulder would have dropped this one in the cylindrical X-file without a second thought."
3,"So-so, makes you think....","I read the book on someone's recommendation. I liked the story and found the premise interesting. However, I am not an early adopter of new techologies. This will have to move a little further into the mainstream before I'm willing to fork out my money to try it. If it really works for people - fantastic. The story is good and well written, but I thought of it as a sales pitch."
1,Poor Quality: Satin finish looks scratched,Very disappointed with my purchase. Poorly made and carelessly packaged. Many handles looked damaged where scratches show easily with the satin finish. Do not waste your money.
1,Not working after 6 months,"I am surprised how flash drive fails to work by itself! It no longer saves or deletes. I am not able to delete the files I have on it individually, or in groups, or by formatting! I do not recommend this product at all."
1,Essentially a disposable USB drive!,As an IT professional I deal with USB flash drives quite frequently. Needless to say I have been VERY disappointed with the SanDisk Cruzer Micro drives. I bought one in December 2005 and used it to transfer files between home and the office. It worked fine for about 4 months and then died with the same symptoms everyone is reporting here - basically it all means there are bad sectors on the drive and it is irreparable. So I thought it was a fluke and got another one in April. It lasted one month before crashing just like the other one did. Don't buy this unless you're in the market for a disposable drive!
2,Somewhat slow and now dead,"Bought this maybe 6 months ago. Worked OK for a while, although things like erasing multiple files always took a long time. Otherwise, it was speedy and worked OK. Until now. Now I get ""Delayed Write Error"" and cannot write to, erase, or reformat (although I can still read). Same behavior seen when trying it on 3 different computers (all up-to-date XP). Oh well - guess I'll spend more money and get a better one next time. Bummer :-("
1,"Works fine, protective case is very flawed","Unlike the other users, I haven't had any problems with the technical side of the drive.However, my issue is with the plastic sleeve that it comes with. I've had mine less than 3 months, and I've already lost all three plastic sleeves it comes with. They slip off in your pocket, when you're moving it around, etc.What good is having a protective case for a USB drive that you're supposed to carry on your keychain if they just fall off? Mine is now totally unprotected, so I can't really carry it in my pocket anymore."
5,Swedish glory,Jussi's voice throughout the whole album evidences the fact that he has been the master of technical singing during this Century. You simply cannot touch this man.
3,"Not bad, but not LIVE AT 25","It was okay. Live at 25 has better sound, better audio...and Huey has a better voice now."
1,"A rotten, rotten pretender to the throne","I once inquired of Amazon if they had any ""product"" of Paul McCartney's latest ('05-'07), and somehow Huey (sans Dewey & Louie) Lewis was trotted out. Absolute rock and roll blasphemy to insert one of the main reasons that ""eighties music"" stunk in the same ""search"" as one of the Beatles. I hope I live long enough to see Huey Lewis, ""Bono,"" and Garth Brooks exposed as the sheer, fabricated hoaxes that they are. Amazon, this is absolutely inexcusible."
3,Some interesting ideas,"If you are a cook (or an aspiring cook) who wants to do some gift baskets for friends and family, this is a good book for you. There are a lot of recipes and ways to include them in the back of this book. I'm not a cook, but I do like to look at pictures of gift baskets. I was disappointed because there are only 26 pictures in the book, with about 100 different gift basket ideas in the form of lists of things to include. The pictures that were there didn't quite match the author's descriptions, either. If you are looking for a list of things to include in a basket, along with recipes, this is a good book for you. If you want visuals to stimulate your creativity, I would suggest Bountiful Baskets by Sara Toliver, or A Gift for Giving by Donna Lang."
2,"Combination of author's previous books, for the most part","This book is roughly about 75% of the info contained in two of the author's other books ""The Perfect Mix"" and ""The Perfect Basket"", with some photos added (the other two books have no photos). Some of it is updated (e.g. CDs instead of cassettes).If you don't need the photos, there is not much new if you already have the other two books (I already had them, thought this was a completely new book).Borrow from the library if you already have the other two books."
4,a classic flick,"corey haim in top form.god knows what happened to his career. with the type of films he did under his belt,he should have stuck around much much longer than he did.this film though in all fairness was one of my favourites.from the plot to the cast to the acting was truly flawless in an old school kinda way that we all love so much.oh and very smart choice whoever did the casting for this movie didn't concider having corey feldman in it.perhaps he was the reason haim's career failed so miserably.sorry all you feldman fans but i think the guy was too full of himself which was such a turn off on screen.anyways getting back to the subject.....dream machine does not disappoint.one of the best corey haim flicks ever.this obviously does not include lost boys since that movie is in a league of it's own.the fact that it's only out on vhs sucks though.can't wait for the dvd."
1,"Must... help.... get the truth out there... ""0 stars""","Anyone who would buy into this pointless new series surely must not be aware of Lewis' originals! I read the real thing in the primary grades and was read aloud from them during arts & crafts time at school, and can't stand the thought of anyone mistaking this pablum for the original story, nor would I help to deprive anyone of the joy of Lewis' intact books."
1,"Let's raise the bar, parents!","My five and seven year olds sat mesmerized on either side of me as I read all seven of the original books to them within a four week period. They weren't bored, didn't miss the pictures and seemed to ""get"" much more of it than I'd thought they would. The videos are wonderful, but I wouldn't let them see them until they had finished all the books, because what they came up with in their imaginations was infinitely superior even to those. No, they didn't understand it the way a teenager or a 47 year old would (I was thrilled to read the series for the first time myself) but they now have something real on which to build, something to which they can return in their imaginations, and something to demonstrate to them what ""real"" writing is. Please don't cheat your children...or yourselves."
2,"great looking shoes, that only look great","When I got the shoes, i loved it. I am not online shoe shopper, so i was taking risk with size and look. Well shoes look simply stunning. In fact next day when i was wearing them, i felt that i got the hottest shoes in town. Well day after that, when i was out with my Gf, i misstepped and accidentally nicked them. When i looked down on the, to my surprise rather then seeing a line or something leathery, i see WHITE material under the covers. In fact it looks like shoes are wrapped in some material, and outside is not leather. Even though it feels and looks like leather, any nick will reveal WHITE base of the shoe. I was very disappointed, because once you nick it, you are done, it looks hideous. The only plus that his shoes have, is ,they look HOT, so if you are a person who never scratches shoes, then its for you, the rest of us avoid them like plague."
2,Picture isnt very accurate,"I owned the black pair of slip ons of this exact shoe and wanted the matching brown. Looking at the pictures I thought I would be happy with them but when I received them I immediately boxed them back up. The uppers are a very ""veiny"" brown with multiple shades running throughout the shoe. They would be fine for wearing out I guess but not as a casual shoe at the office."
5,JAX FOR LIFE,"I have to say being a Jags fan for awhile, this is one nice go anywhere shirt to add to my collection. Great for showing your pride at the gym, cycling, or even walking on the beach. Other then that, what can I say. It's a shirt."
2,Poor Quality,"This is the third Delphi product I have purchased for use with XM SkyFi2 system. Each Delphi product had to be returned because of problems; sound card problem, antenna connection would not maintain contact with signal, etc. The sound was very good when the systems were working. The purpose of buying the portable units was to use the SkyFi2 outside of the home. I gave up on the portable systems and now have the home kit for SkyFi2 connection to my home stereo system. So far so good. I have had it hooked-up and working one week."
4,Boombox with nice sound,"This system was very easy to set up and came with clear, concise instructions for use. The sound is full and satisfying. My only reservations are; using the unit with a Roady XT requires an adapter (nicely included) which seems to get fairly hot after prolonged use, and the volume control is a knob on the front which feels a bit flimsy. I will probably end up buying the Roady XT remote so that I don't have to deal with turning the knob all the time. I bought this unit for it's design and sound quality, and overall, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase."
2,"Garb, don't waste your money","I was interested in the Dynomite Hack song and I remember from having their album that was the only song I liked. I searched Amazon for the song and found this, I thought that more of the same would be great, I was wrong. Just download the song you want and save time and money."
1,Boyz 'n the Hood is bleeped,"Dynamite Hack's Boyz 'n the Hood is bleeped. I wasted a buck.What part of ""Explicit Lyrics"" is confusing?"
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"I'll say this straight to the point-most of these songs i haven't heard the original versions. The way they are done on this compilation is just awsome, but it might not be for a fan of rap or one that just wants exact remakes. The best songs on here are the Nonpoint track Tribute, which kicks a$$ at high levels of sound...track 7 by Kottonmouth Kings is also an awsome song to crank up, thought that is also on their new album, Hidden Stash 2-KotK...The ICP and Sevendust songs are the last 2 stand outs...Mindless Self Indulgence has an interesting sound to their track...the rest are just alright."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","This cd is a good concept, but unfortunatly, none of these guys are rappers,a nd you can tell. Not only that, the background riffs all sound they same, and they come off horribly. A very disappointing effort from some otherwise big name perfomers."
2,starts with a bang and ends with a flush,"started out pretty good shows how Paul Heyman ""Robbed Peter to pay Paul"" and so on after awhile you forget who owes what and how much to who and really you stoping caring you just want it all to end really expected more i am sorry guys i really liked the ECW but in the end it sounds like E C DUH!"
5,Better than restaurant quality,"I'm not an English major - but this is awesome. I saw this at a brick and mortar high end store for $300 while on vacation. Caught a deal from Amazon for $210 w/ free shipping. Using a recipe listed here in the reviews, my first effort was as good or better than any waffle I've ever had at any restaurant - ever, and I do like waffles. Big ? Yes. Easy to use ? Forrest Gump could use it, if he would read the instructions and follow them. It is just simply must have - for any cool kitchen.Forget about those $40 chump toys. Get the real deal. Don't know how I ever got along without it."
1,"Got refund after 3 bad units, junk product, good customer service, slow RMA process","Junk product, great customer service, LONG delays in between RMA's.I purchased the first Pro-Line Waffle Maker in January and it was DOA (heating element bad). I was informed several weeks after placing RMA that the Pearl was no longer available and they shipped a Nickel unit in 3/2007 that was also a DOA fire hazzard (continues to heat up when turned off). Finally in 5/2007, the third unit shows up is ALSO DOA! This one will heat up and never recognize it is ready to cook such that there is no countdown timer. 3 bad units and 5 months later, customer service offered a refund."
3,"Great aesthetics, but some problems","The unit is lovely and it makes a sunday breakfast a special ritual. Unfortunately it tends to bake one side of the waffle darker than the other, and after a while the rotating cooking surface no longer remains in a fully horizontal positon. Kitchen Aid backs it up, and will send you a new one immediately. But unfortunately, in our case, the two replacements suffered from similar problems. We have reached the point where we are no longer swapping waffle irons with kitchen aid and just remain slightly dissatisfied with the unit."
4,Holley 4150-4160 handbook,Book is smaller than a regular manual so it makes easy referencing. It is in black and white but the pictures are very good quality and easy to read.
3,Good Book But........,"This is a concise book which gives a good basic understanding of this series of Holley carburetors. However it is dated from the eighties, also the format is about the size of a paperback book. I would recomend it but know what you arte buying, I like short books."
5,Very good value!,"The shoes are surprisingly lightweight for steel-toe shoes and at a great value.Very comfy, good style, and I definitely recommend this product."
5,Craaaaaazzzzzzzyyyyyyyyyyyy Man Crazzzzzzzzzzzy,"Except for one cut, this disc would be an absolutely awesome collection by this legendary sax honker. ""Shiggty Boom"",with vocals by the original Platters, goes beyond description! One of the best things I have ever heard, and I've heard plenty of great music! Stop reading, start buying! Blow Joe Blow!!! Five million stars!"
5,Rebirth of Poco,"This early 70's album by the band showed their new direction as one of the leaders in the country rock style the Eagles were to soon make a lot of money on. Title track is a classic and there are several other songs such as Starin at the Sky,Stealaway and Too Many Nights To Long that set the sound for the groups next several albums.They toured with Neil Young and Crazyhorse after this album was released and more than held their own as opening act.Timothy schmidt eventually left the band to join the eagles at the end of their run.But this 1976 album is great for the tunes and as a new sound for Poco."
2,Nothing special,"If this was supposed to be a high quality version of the original release, it falls far short. Love Poco, but there is nothing on this pressing that is remarkable from a sound quality standpoint. Played on a high end system, it sounds like a cassette dub from a Sears combo system from the 80's. Save yer' money and pray it's re-released on an LP."
3,Somewhat complicated routine and awful video quality,"This video appears as though it's a home video taken of an aerobics class at a gym. The sound is horrible - I have to turn the volume way up to hear what she's saying, and as for the music - it sounds like it's coming from a boombox in the back of the room. The picture quality is pretty poor too - much like an amateur home video would look. What is also really irritating is that in one of the parts where she adds a very complicated part to a routine, the camera angle shifts, and you can't see what her feet are doing at all! And it stays this way for several minutes. The routine is somewhat complicated, but I think I could learn it after a few times doing it. It seems like a pretty good workout in terms of the impact - I was able to keep up most of the time, and I worked up a good sweat. It's just a shame that it was shot so poorly."
3,Too Hard To Follow,"I like Janis I would kill for her body, but I thought this video was too hard to follow. She gave decent directions and cues .. I guess but I thought the Choreography was too complicated and I kept tripping over my step. I've only done this video 3 times and I think I will give it away to someone under 30."
5,Great product!,This set of blocks is very nice and sturdy. Also they are in a nice size easy for children to use. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a set of inexpensive blocks similar to those found in educational settings.
3,Meh - an okay product,"The pepper grinder works fine, although I wish now that I had opted for one you can use with one hand (push down with the thumb). The salt shaker is a pretty poor excuse for a salt shaker though, and the only real reason to purchase this is to have one less bottle on the table. It is very nice aesthetically though."
2,Poor Quality and Impractical,A combo salt and pepper shaker is a good concept in theory but the design on this one doesn't work. Holes in salt shaker are too big and the shaft of the pepper mill rusted from salt seeping through.
4,A handy collection to have around...,"Most diehard Trek fans would already have these themes, but it is useful having them all on one disc. There was an earlier collection of Star Trek movie themes released a few years ago, titled 'The Astral Symphony', but this new disc is, of course, more up-to-date.The stand-outs are the TOS theme (for nostalgia's sake, at least), Goldsmith's wonderful ST:TMP theme (which became the TNG theme), and James Horner's music for ST:TWOK. Strangely, there is nothing from The Search For Spock, but that is probably because that theme was very similar to Horner's ST:TWOK score.And I just gotta say, no matter how many times I hear it...I still find it hard to listen to Leonard Rosenman's theme for The Voyage Home..."
1,Mostly end credits music,"Read the song titles before you buy this. I bought it thinking it was all the opening songs, but it's mostly the closing ones, with the first movie's theme music repeated 3 or 4 times. I gave it 1 star because the only openeing song was IV, which I like. If you really like the end credits music, then by all means get this. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,great star trek compilation,"Very good performances by various orchestras. There are A LOT of star trek themes in this CD so it may be a little overwhelming to play this CD from start to finish. Tracks #2, #9, and #11 are my favorite. Jerry Goldsmith just does a fantastic job on Star Trek arrangements in general. #9 by Frederic Talgorn is probably the most unique of all the arrangements on the theme and I happened to like his the best. Very nice chord progressions with the high woodwinds and lower strings providing a good pulse to the piece. His ability to interweave the star trek theme towards the end of the piece was also expertly handled. The speed and general pacing of this piece is much faster than the original recording that is played in the end credits of ""Generations."" I happen to like this version much better."
2,"""Been there, heard that...""","To anyone who has collected Star Trek musical scores on CD over the years, this latest compilation offers little. As recognizable as the title themes are, they can all be found on previously released Star Trek CD's (...some over and over and OVER again). Varese Sarabande's best contribution to the list of Trek music currently available on CD has been their re-recorded releases of episodic suite music used in the scoring of Star Trek's original 1960's television series. With so many other Star Trek episode suites yet unreleased, why re-package a predictable selection of theme music yet again...? Had there been even one previously unreleased track on this CD, I would have purchased it ...but there isn't, so I didn't."
3,Godzilla BAD!Mechagodzilla GOOD! OH MY!,Not as good as the original.Now Godzilla is an enemy and Mechagodzilla a savior?Mechagodzilla dosen't look like what he did in Godzilla vs.Mechagodzilla or Terror Of Mechagodzilla!But still a good film.
4,A kid's review,"Mechagodzilla2 is okay. He looks kinda funny and the battling of Mechagodzilla2 vs. Godzilla is a little bit to hard to watch. Still I just couldn't give it a 2 or 3 stars, because baby Godzilla is in it too, and everybody loves it."
2,It could have been better,Mechagodzilla would have been better if he was the villian and Godzilla was the hero. Rodan makes an appearance and so that is good. Rodan is too small in this one and it felt like it was the same as the previous movies. It is kind of boring and dull.
5,A Great Movie For the whole family,I have been a Godzilla fan for almost all my life.Since I was 3 or 4 I loved Godzilla.I first saw this movie it was on sifi.My mom told my brother and I that Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla was on.We rushed up stairs grabed a tape and recorded it.But so far this is my favorite.SuperMechagodzilla was awsome.The one thing I don't get is why Mechagodzilla can't fight at close range.The first battle was my favorite battle.In the final battle was awsome.It looked like Godzilla was down for the count.But Baby(the baby godzillasaur)woke up Radon.Radon some how reconstatuted Godzilla's second brain.It was kind of hard to under stand.But over all a great movie.
3,Godzilla,"As with any Godzilla movie, you had to grow up watching these films to appreciate them. I don't think much more can be said. Godzilla 2000 is the only one of the bunch that I would ever show to a non-believer. As for this particular film, see my first sentence."
2,"good story, dull film.",i hate to say it but this is the only godzilla film i have seen that i do not like. why? the G man get's his ass kick then kicking and Mechagodzilla being a good guy does not work out well. if you wath a good G film then get the Godzilla VS. Mechagodzilla from 1974.
5,Mechagodzilla,Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla was an awesome movie I loved it when godzilla used his new red spiral atomic ray to blow Super-Mechagodzilla to pieces and I think that mechagodzilla should have appeared more often in the movie.
5,Godzilla Mega Blow Out!,"This Godzilla movie I have to rate number one on Godzilla movies so far. This movie had pure non-stop destruction. What I liked about this movie is that their are kooler newly made monsters from the other old godzilla movies, also a new monster.But What I liked most about this movie is that the Japanese built a robot Godzilla to try and stop Godzilla from attacking Japan. You will see this movie is non-stop packed monster carnage."
4,Pretty Good,"I am not much of a MechaGodzilla fan, but this movie was ok. Not the best in the Heisei series, definitely not the best out of the entire Godzilla series. The story was good, and so was everything else but I always seem to find MechaGodzilla a little too boring for me. Introducing Godzilla Jr. into the series was good. Calling Rodan by its original Japanese name Radon wasn't that good of an idea. I realize that this is the new series, but come on, call it Rodan, the name people know. Overall, like I said, it's okay. But I'm not really a MechaGodzilla fan so I don't know what MechaGodzilla fans would think about the movie. They might love it to death. So I recommend this movie to MechaGodzilla fans only. It's not bad; it's just not that great either"
4,One of the better Heisei Godzilla flms,"Great Movie. Baby Godzilla is SO CUTE I WANT TO HUG HIM! Mechagodzilla was boring in this film, and Rodan's look is unappealing. On the Positive side, Godzilla looks great! Reccomended"
4,BBBBOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!!!!,"Like Godzilla? Like the new Godzillas? Hate the American?Here's the answer to all your problems: GODZILLA VS MECHAGODZILLA II. While many people said it was the best, I disagree. It's the third best (after the orginal and DESTROY ALL MONSTERS). And please take note I've seen all the Godzilla movies, foreign and domestic."
2,"Cheesy, Poor overall.","I like godzilla. This movie unfortunately is terrible. The acting is silly and childish, the dialogue is [bad] and the plot is as simple as ever. The special effects are still very old fashioned (will they ever learn?) with wires, monster suits and little models. Godzilla 2000 is better in the effects department and acting, however the storyline is still fairly poor. Overall: MEDIOCRE."
5,Classis Redux,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I like the classic monsters with combination of Mechagodzilla.I like the feel of the picture.
4,godzilla vs mecagodzilla 2,all godzilla movies are good my garadson love then for i got hom hoocked on godzilla he watches them all the time when he vists me
2,Continued disappointment,"I bought this based on the one good song on the album: captain fingers, something from 30 years ago. I must have Ritenour wrong. His 1983 album On the Line was one of the best of the decade, and I have been looking forward to a repeat, and my CD collection of his work has grown in that pursuit. With occasional splashes of life, his music seems to be in a word bland. I'm finally making use of the samples amazon makes available."
1,Old doesn't automatically mean good - DONT BUY,"This was poorly filmed and edited in the 50's. It is no classic. Image quality is so poor that even mountains are difficult to distiguish. This movie is sadly morbid in music, tone and narration. There are no interesting dinosaur shots. There are no characters. Found it to be a total disappointment, as did, by the way, my five year old. This is rather gutsy for anyone to be selling B rate TV fare as if it were of value today. Put this one back in the time vault, its a complete waste of time and money."
3,"Outstanding recipes, but read caveat below","The recipes in this book are truly outstanding, and I would recommend them to anyone who loves good food. However, they are interspersed with feminist, lesbian, and erotic poetry. My personal belief is that there is a time and place for everything, and that a cookbook is neither the time nor the place for such passages. To say the least, I found the quotes very disconcerting -- and some quite offensive.The recipes are truly outstanding ... Just be forewarned about the poetry/quotations."
2,A mixed bag ...,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. Although I support gay rights (and gay marriages), I *don't* want to read erotic lesbian literature -- much less in a cookbook -- and found that aspect very offensive. I was also annoyed to find numerous seafood recipes in a cookbook that claims to be vegetarian. Since most appetizers, side dishes, breads, and desserts are meatless, the main draw of a vegetarian cookbook is that of the main dishes -- of which there aren't very many, especially when you eliminate those that contain seafood. (They could have at least put those in a separate chapter.) Although the recipes are excellent, there are a number of vegetarian cookbooks with excellent vegetarian recipes and no lesbian poetry."
2,Misleading,Ok I was NOT expecting this from DW...The beater in the picture looks waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay smaller than the one I got. Don't get me wrong it's an amazing product if purchased alone. I got two of these for my Axis longboards cz I wasn't getting enough volume for its beaters. I blame DW for not providing a proper description for this product. They should at least mention that two of these WOULD NOT work on a double pedal. They would get stuck together because of the size.Do not buy 2 of these if you have a double pedal.
3,somewhat dissatified,Received and the deck is cracked. Emailed Amazon who at this point has failed to respond. It is for my daughters 10th birthday.....the deck is cracked and we would just prefer to have that replaced instead of sending back the entire ramps with deck. So Amazon if you are reading this please let us know. I have purchase many things from Amazon and never had a problem until now. I never expected a lack of assistance.......this will definitely make me think twice prior to ordering any purchases from this site again. There is no phone numbers that we can find to speak with a live person.
3,Agreement,"I don't wish to submit a full review of this, other than to say that because of who Horowitz was, this is a valuable document.I did want to agree with A. Ainley's assessment of the playing. The Scherzo was a shock -- this was a piece that Horowitz ate for breakfast in his prime. His playing here is a pale imitation of his great days; feeble was the first word that came to mind as I listened to this. Sviatoslav Richter noted how bad this performance was in the ""Richter the Enigma"" video. I am guessing that this was more due to lack of practice, rather than the permanent effects of his age, because the subsequent concert in Moscow was much more like the Horowitz we once knew.This video also illustrates how even a pianist as great as Horowitz (and perhaps as crazy) could delude himself into thinking he could play Mozart. I suspect that his mentor, Rachmaninoff, would have had some words with him about his work in K.330. It's just not playing that can be taken seriously."
2,Don't bother,"An amazingly trite book. A confusing combination of historical and current witchcraft. Never finds a focus and has often laughable information. Incredibly strange selection of who to include in the listings of witches from stage and screen, witches in legend and myth and real-life witches. Heavy focus on ""Buffy"", ""The Craft"" and ""Charmed"", so I guess this book is geared towards teens and 20-somethings...That's too bad as the book also contains several interesting prints and pictures, and, overall is quite well made.A coffee-table book for the ""Witchcraft for Dummies"" set."
3,Mucho vínculo emocional...,"La verdad es un buen disco. Las nuevas versiones de las canciones están bastante bien, a pesar de la evidente falta de presupuesto.Se siente un muy buen sentido de la música, con arreglos que denotan una buena intención, pero sin llegar a ser impresionantes.En general, es un buen disco, que funciona bien antes que nada por el gran vínculo nostálgico de Timbiriche con el público y en segundo porque los arreglos son suaves, refrescados, y mucho en linea con las nuevas tendencias musicales."
2,No era lo que esperaba,"No es el ritmo de las canciones originales, y cuando revise la informacion del CD las muestras de las canciones SI eran las originales."
1,The worst remake ever,"I grew up with timbiriche Music, and i'm always proud to say that i'm part of Generacion Timbiriche.However when I heard Princesa Tibetana in this new ""remix"" I was appalled! What a horrible idea!! why choose to ruin such a beautiful song with this ugly version? I can't recommend this cd to any good fan. It was the worst thing they could have done. If you don't want to ruin your memories of this great 80's music (early 90's) do not buy it. You're better off listening to the real thing."
2,I wonder why...,"Timbiriche was the most succeful teen band in the 80's.They stil very famous and they sold out all their concerts in this 2007 ""reunion"".But,I wonder why they re-recorder their olds hits with new music????I don't like this ""formula"".We know all their songs, why this again??Whatever,you can buy it, it's up to you.........For me It's not worth it.songs:""Mexico"".-the very bad song in all cd. with a very weird music, they ruin the song.the rest, so-so.not my favorite cd in my car.Besides, Paulina Rubio( The worst voice in Timbiriche) doesn't participate in this cd. Timbiriche without Paulina,it is not Timbiriche.."
2,Baño de Señoritas CD,English sung album by this excellent South American band but the sound quality has the typical needle drop No-noise sound of many obscure psych cd reissues. I hope for a better reissue in the near future
5,Beautiful Book For Children !,"I was happily surprised with this book - it's really big and eye catching with it's pictures and colors! The two stories are wonderful - children love this book because it has everything - big print, color, superb graphics, stories, size, etc. Also, when you buy this book, the publisher ships an identical one to a child in the Ukraine, Moldova, or Russia, printed in their native language! What a wonderful idea and great generosity!"
2,Can't Sleep - Not a bedtime winner.,"Although this is a relatively thick board book, I honestly don't feel it is worth the paper it's printed on. The drawings are colourful but badly drawn, the text is simple but doesn't flow well making it almost boring. The story itself is reassuring for little ones hesitant to go to bed at night, but I do wish that a better job was done with this book. If you are looking for a cute/fun bedtime book you are better off checking out the Sandra Boynton selection. This book would only benefit someone trying to ease a childs fear and even then, the book is not that interesting."
3,Passable music - not the best from the artists,"I had great expectations for this product based on the other reviews. I have so far listened to the Dining and Dancing CDs. I am not a music expert, but even to me most of the songs seemed to be mediocre selections of the artists.The dance music may be good for tap dancers. There was hardly any good swing selections. The Louis Armstrong selection is hardly dance music. There is nothing that says that a particular music relates to the activity.But it is still a good selection from a wide variety of artistes."
5,Soul Can Heal,Soul Mind Body Medicine is a Healers Bible. I know that is a wrap and in my experience this book is a must have in your healing book collection. Why? Dr Sha explains Why and How the Soul Can heal. Energy and Matter are carriers of Message. Message is another word for Soul. Heal the Soul First and the Mind and Body will follow. I experienced the power of this wisdom by applying it to chronic flu infections I was having. I not only recovered from the flu my whole health improved. Thank you Dr Sha.Soul Mind Body Medicine: A Complete Soul Healing System for Optimum Health and Vitality
1,not the book I wanted,"For some reason this book is being substituted for the book I wanted, originally ordered as The Power of the Soul but even on the confirmation (which I unfortunately did not check when it came through) this title had been substituted. The same thing happened when I ordered the book from the local public library. I have inquired from both Amazon and the library why this happened but no one has had an adequate answer. Beware ordering The Power of the Soul (same author) because you will not get it. You'll get this one instead (with no explanation)."
1,Beware,"Buyers please be aware!"" Please do your research before you invest your time and money. Please look at all the 5 star reviews as they are planted from his followers. Do not be mislead by all the 5 star reviews. This is a very powerful CULT which feeds on new people and their bank accounts. Please look within yourself and if you are on the spiritual path I highly recommend you reading, Eyes Wide open, cultivating discernment on the spiritual path by Mariana Caplan. I have been with this group and loss time and money. Please Caveat Emptor!!!! Buyers Beware!!!"""
4,Cool Game,"I like this game a lot. Not really because of a superb gaming system, but rather for the overall concept. If you like role playing games, and liked the film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, then you should like this. Basically you play an `pulp-action' hero, kind of like Indiana Jones, in a world were, during the 1930's, science had successful offshoots in fields science that, in the real world, we never took. Tesla coils and scalar beam weapons, crude robots, armored zeppelins, and mad scientists now are part of history, in the setting of WWII.Pretty neat !"
5,GREAT RELEASE,Great release and second to none. Really durable and easy to use. I love it because I just attach it to my bow and it alows my hands to stay free. The biggest worry would be losing it.
2,junk,"I normally shoot with a wrist release, but I decided to give the T-handle a try, if you do try one make sure it is not this one. The ammount of pressure you have to apply to the ""trigger"" is more than I would like, it is also not a quick release you have to depress the trigger in order to open the jaws. overall if you are using a bow with suction cups on it i might use this but still it would be a tossup between my fingers and this"
4,A good classic family drama...,"Emilie (Ingrid Bergman), a french governess, is hired by wealthy Adam Stoppard (Warner Baxter) and his wife Molly to look after their four sons. Following the untimely death of their mother, the boys grow to depend on Emilie more.When the boys are older they join the army. When they return home one of them brings home a beautiful wife Hester (Susan Hayward). It soon becomes clear that Hester is trouble. She's a heartless gold-digger that nearly splits the family apart. Can Emilie hold the family together with Hester around causing trouble?Over the years Emilie's feelings for Adam grow deeper and she falls in love with him. Even the though the boys are now men at this point, Adam insists that she come and live with them again as part of the family...."
3,Excellent sophmore effort by Ingrid Bergman,"*** Possible Spoilers***When Adam needs a new governess for his four sons, he and his wife hire a French governess to take care of them. The wife soon dies and over the years she becomes the mainstay of the home, in spite of a stock market crash, World War I and the straying wife of one of the boys. A good effort by all, including a young and manipulative Susan Hayward. Given the era, some of the content was surprising and the story was by no means a conventional epic."
3,"Ordinary movie, but good acting,enjoyable to watch...","I bought this movie and watched it only because I am a fanatic of Ingrid Bergman and a collector of her movies. It was not an extraordinary film. But there was some real good acting especially from Susan Hayward. The story was enjoyable but the ending was a bit poor as everything happened too fast and there was no drama. Anyway, there was Ingrid Bergman and I enjoyed every single moment of her appearance, especially the scene where her nice character got mad with Hayward's character and attempted to throw her out of the house."
2,"Well, Here's an Argument for Population Control!","I rented ""Adam Had Four Sons"" because of its promising cast: Ingrid Bergman, Warner Baxter, Fay Wray, and Susan Hayward. How could it miss? Ah, but it does. Ingrid is very implausible as the servant/mother figure to Warner's sons after Fay's untimely death. Ingrid and Warner learn to love each other. Then, because of gossip, she leaves him and the sons in the lurch. Enter some years later, Susan as a vixen engaged to one son but making her play for another. Enter Ingrid again to put a stop to this shameful behavior. Enter me to turn it off. Just too ridiculously played, not even good enough for camp."
2,Poor quality,"Upon my first use with this product, both of the inserts of the main buttons cracked and fell into the unit. There they remained, rattling inside until I sent this back for a return. In addition to this, the sound card also had periodic bouts of ""speeding up"" the music and caused a major conflict with iTunes. Don't waste your money."
3,Okay - but,Nice flexible cable but the snaps are a little light and quickly corrode and get rough to operate when left outdoors. Bigger better snaps would make a lot of difference.
5,Petmate 1700 pound tie out cable,"I have 2 overhead dog runs outside my house and 2 of my dogs are very large and powerful. Even though I only have my dogs outside when I can be right there, I still go thru several of these every year and the Petmate ones seem to last the longest. The dogs run and run and play on these over-head runs. It's almost as good as freedom, but much safer."
1,Not very sturdy,This cable is suppose to handle a small to medium sized dog and I hooked my 20 lb ridgeback up to it and he broke the snap in les than thirty seconds. The cable itself seems to be sturdy but the snaps are cheap. For the money get it but go to the hardware store and get some .85 cent snaps to hook on it.
2,"Seems strong enough, but already kinking","We have two Labs, one around 70 pounds and one around 100. We go back and forth between two houses and wanted to have some tie-outs at each. We had bought two cables at the local supermarket for the same price as these, and they are about twice the thickness and have been trouble-free. We bought two of these, and within a week they are getting kinked. Also, the clips aren't as big and easy to use as the supermarket cables. Disappointing."
2,Aspen Pet 30Ft 170Lb Pet Tieout Cable,"I have a 60lb collie german shepard mix that spends 75% of her time on this tie out, in approx. 1 month use, the cable frayed and broke. I was hoping that this product would have been better than what I could have bought at my local superstore.NOT!!"
2,Dog chewed half through within a week,"My dog chewed through a lighter weight cable so I bought this one thinking it be too strong to chew threw. I guess she knew it was possible so she worked on it as soon as I wasn't watching and had it half way chewed through within a week. Had to switch to a stainless steel traditional chain. She isn't a huge dog either, just a 50 lb Belgian shepherd and they are not known as chewers."
4,History Buff,"Doctor Danker was one of my favorite history professors and a man who loved the story of the westward movement with a passion and with a down-to-earth human persepective. Though he passed on nearly a year ago, I still can see him in my mind's eye lecturing about the move west while standing before us in his somewhat rumpled brown suit, bathed in the fall afternoon sun with his head thrown back, his graying shock of hair standing up a bit and his eyes closed as he told us a story. He was wonderful at discovering and using journals to illustrate the lives and times. In my senior year he set me to reading the journals of the Agent for the Pawnee Reservation on the Loup Fork in Nebraska. He was a Nebraska native and had a special affinity for the stories from that state. I have an old copy of this book and it is a treasure to me not only for it's fascinating content and it's own story, but because of the memory of Dr. Danker it brings to me."
1,not worth it!!,"This thing is impossible to use, the holder only holds smaller rolls of plastic and foil, so if you buy in bulk or large styles, it won't work. Besides that, it's a poor design, wastes more then is useable....go low tech in the kitchen., gadgets like this are a waste of $50."
2,Good looking but doesn't work,"It did a great job cutting plastic wrap, but it would shred foil and constantly cause it to get stuck. It does work for paper towels. It looks nice enough that we tried hard to get it to work, but at the end of the day, it just doesn't."
1,Not what I expected,"It was very expensive, very hard to use, not what I had expected.I would not recomend this product to anyone."
4,Nice Recording,"The fun thing about this CD is that most of the songs are not traditional Christmas songs, which get so over-played during the holidays. So these cuts add a fresh dimention to your holiday mix if you drop this CD into your random CD carosel."
5,Not quite 25 years old and I love it,"My mother used to play this in the tape version when I was young. We played it EVERY Christmas thereafter until we wore the tape out. Now, at 24, I have my own house, and I miss the old songs. They really made Christmas special. So, I downloaded the mp3 version for quicker access. Nostalgia is much in the eye of the beholder. For those of us who grew up to this music, this brings back wonderful memories. I would assume that my Great grandmother and/or grandmother got my mother hooked, as she (my mother) is only in her mid 40's. I would definitely recommend this even if you've never heard it before."
3,not for the younger readers,"My son is in second grade but reads at a 5th grade level. It can be tricky to choose books for him--if the reading level is right, the topic may be too mature for him. In this case, most of the book is lovely, giving readers insight into what life would be like if they had a handicap--in this case, cerebral palsy. The idea of a secret dragon coming to life was great for fantasy-lovers, and Eddie's perserverance and sense of honor and fair play while overcoming difficulties was thought-provoking.HOWEVER, the descriptions of Eddie being bullied were way too terrifying for younger kids, IMO. I would caution parents of children under, say, 4th grade, to give the next-to-last chapters a read before giving it to younger kids."
1,Irrelevant and ad hominem attacks,"Witherington engages in irrelevant and ad hominem attacks. He has not interacted with, or even significantly referenced, serious dispensational scholarship. The author is entitled to his views but that entitlement does not give him a license to be less than accurate, painting an incomplete and unbalanced picture of dispensationalism. And it certainly does not give him the right to be dismissive, derisive, harsh, or censorious in his unfair criticism of dispensational theology. As one dispensational scholar once wrote: ""Normative dispensationalism is a legitimate, worthy, and conservative viewpoint. Other Christians do not have to agree with it, but they should represent it fairly and treat its contributions with respect. This is simply a matter of Christian integrity and courtesy."" Unfortunately, Witherington misses the mark completely regarding both integrity and scholarship in this book."
3,Good research for Ojibwe Indians,"This was a helpful guide for my latest novel, Neitherworld (also sold on Amazon), albeit a little thin on substance. The pictures are helpful as is the chronology."
4,Another Super Saiyan?!!!,"While Goku is still out in space, Gohan is in the School of Hard Knocks, literally. But then he senses a presence. Is it possible? Is Frieza still alive? It looks like it and it looks like it he and his father King Cold are heading to earth and the Z fighters are faced with a dilemma without Goku, but who is this purple haired dude? Does he have a death wish? It looks like this unknown soldier seems to have made a wild claim to destroy Frieza, but when he transforms into a super saiyan, it's obvious that Frieza is no match for this mysterious youth. But when Frieza did his Death Ball attack and blasted a hole in it, it looked like he finished off this unknown Super Saiyan, but he launched a explosive attack and he was about to slice Frieza in half. Is the terror really over? Has Frieza finally been destroyed? And who is this unknown Super Saiyan? Watch more of this short saga and find out!!!!!"
4,could have been better,"i rated it 4 stars because it could have fit 1 more episode here is where we meet trunks and cyborg freeza along with his father king kold we also find out trunks can go super saiyan. but i thought goku,vegeta, and gohan where the only saiyans left. get's you wondering doesn't it"
4,trunks is the cool looking super saiyan.,"ok i got the videos and it's cool, and like the guy said frieza is back and more powerful than ever this time he bring his father king cold now it's cyber frieza, i like frieza like that, frieza power level is 12,500,000 and king cold is 13,000,000 and as for trunks (supressed 5) in super saiyan 17,000,000 now he kill frieza trunks kill him really good than goku did, he cut him in half then cut his body parts and bow it up, and have to see the rast and goku super super saiyan when he come back 20,000,000 i can't wait for the next video's comeing in july 4 buy this tape it's cool."
2,Funimation's DBZ ? No thanks....,Dont get me wrong DBZ is one of my fave animes. But the way it was dubbed (King Cold *shudder*) was pretty poor. Funimation has improved with the Trunks/Andriod saga but the script changes wernt needed. I wouldn't mind as much if the uncut verson was $5 more for 15 seconds of footage the skiped over on the tv show. If you like DBZ go get the DVD version so you can watch the subbed version!
1,Hey awesome dude! MMMMMM....Not!,"I think I will pass. I recommend this CD if you really enjoy sloppy guitar playing, almost non-existint bass, a drummer for who all I know is a 5 year old banging twigs on a 5 gallon buckett, and singer who sits there and screams all the lyrics. I have heard so much of Officer Negative's material on GRock it makes me sick. Grock is almost always a good show but when they start with the Officer Negative songs I flip the channel. This is really not good music...I don't even know if it is music. Officer Negative wastes good lyrics because they are such a horrible band. They have good songs lyric wise but no one is going to listen to them when they are this bad."
1,punk rock for jesus...man how things have changed,"Oh great just what we really really need these days...Christian punk rock...well Officer Negative is a very boring band. If they quit showing off their love for Christ for 2 seconds then maybe they...well they'd still (...). Christian punk has always been a sham , but this is pathetic...now punk has gone from rebellious music to (...)your parents to still untalented music the whole family can listen to ...keep God out of punk...thats all I ask we don't need religious sects coming in and exploiting themselves through punk rock..it's a joke...and this band needs to get a life"
2,Mannheim c.d.,"The person I bought this for for Christmas does not like it at all. In fact, it was returned to me but I know I can't send it back because it was opened.Not your fault, as the item was exactly what I ordered, but I will be more careful next time."
3,25 Year Celebration of Mannheim Steamroller,"Not as inspiring as their Christmas music, but quite catchy.Blessings to Amazon!"
5,mannheim,love Mannheim steamroller - they are the best all the cd's i got are awesome. i saw mannheim a couple years ago - but loved them prior to their show - which was outstanding.amazon is the best place to order from - you almost always have it if no one else does - that why I use amazon & love you guys. i thinkover all the years i've been ordering - there was only 1 time I had a problem & that was a missing kindle - you guys de-activated the missing kindle & sent me a new one - no charge. . . WOW - just unheard of today - you know? people are sheisty - but amazon gave me the benefit of the doubt - I have no idea WHO got MY kindle - but I was happy to know they could never use it! LOL
5,great music,I had gone to see this outfit in concert last month and wouldnt pay the high price to buy a cd so ordered from amazon. I bought two for the price of one at the concert and enjoy them immensely
4,A Well Chosen Sampling of the Past 25 Years,"18th-century rock 'n' roll? Neo-classical? Progressive electronic? Whatever you call the music of Omahan Chip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller, this is an adequate sampling of the music they've been churning out for the past 25 years. [At less than 90 minutes over two discs, it's not over-generous, but there are 25 tracks. (25 tracks, 25 years--get it?)]Virtually every album from the Steamroller catalog and Davis' Day Parts series is represented. The music is at times raucus, the next moment introspective and serene (and even sometimes a bit formulaic) as it combines elements of classical music with plenty of synthesizers and percussion into its trademark pop orchestral sound.True fans will probably already own all of the individual CDs sampled on this collection. But for the unitiated who perhaps are wondering why Steamroller has managed to sell more than 20 million albums, this is an excellent place to start. RECOMMENDED"
5,An Absolutely Perfect Collection of Great Music.,"Perfect for those who like Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas work and want to hear more of what Mannheim Steamroller has to offer. The 25th Year Celebration set takes its listeners to ""Another Place,"" (as the song is entitled). with a wonderful integration of the greatest songs in the early Fresh Aire series with the newest work on the upcoming DVD, Fresh Aire 8. If you want the greatest songs in the Fresh Aire series (or never heard them before) and don't want to buy all the albums, this is the next best thing! For ""Aireheads"" and new Steamroller fans, this is a must have!"
4,Hard to get item,"After going to the local RV store and being told that the item would cost $39.95 and $80.00 to install! I then went to another RV Store where the owner looked at my installation and told me to take off two nuts lift the toilet and move it forward.This would make access to the valve.I did as he said and removed the valve; which was broken. He looked it up but said I could get it cheaper if I went On-line and bought it from Amazon.com.I did and saved one hell of a lot of MONEY!Wild BillRidgecrest, CA"
5,perfect replacement,"I didn't think I would be able to find a replacement part for a 30 year old camper.This one was an exact replacement, it was perfect."
5,Great quality,There's a lot of adaptors on the market that I wouldn't really trust due to poor quality. I originally got one of these by chance. It's perfect so it prompted me to by another 4!!
3,Just another romance novel.,"I feel Ms. Mott's talents would be better used elsewhere. In a different genre. It appears to me that her talents are oppressed by the standard algorithms all (published) romance novelests are required to use when writing their romance novels.Give this book a read. (The characters do have more personality than most romance novel characters I've encountered.) But when you're done, write a letter to Ms. Mott. Encourage her to transcend her apparant feelings of inferiority that seem to cause her to feel as if the romance genre is the only one she can be published in.Being a woman who has had much horse-experience myself, I can appreciate the precise accuracy of Ms. Mott's horse-related details in this novel.(MS. MOTT! Your creativity is like a penned wild horse, waiting to be let free from the hoof-shackles Harlequin keeps on it!)"
4,This CD is great! I just love the sound of this group!,We saw Sister's Wade at a Charlie Daniel's concert. They were great! I just had to get their CD. I love the true country sound they have!
2,More of a journal than a book....,While I was reading this book I felt like I was reading journal. Essentialy it was a journal with a little plot to beef up and pad the book. This was hard to read because it had very few exciting points. I only finished this because I had to read it for a class.
3,Cukoo for Coco Puffs,"A novel by the acclaimed Cliff Stoll who hacked the hackers because of a 75 cent error in a computer log. Cliff Stoll was an astronomer at Berkley who single handedly took down the hacker known as ""Hunter"" and discovered the hacker's link to industrial espionage."
5,Holds up well over time,"Despite the events of this book having taken place 15 years ago, it still holds up well even now. 15 years in computer time is a millenium, but many of the basic ideas and concepts still remain. A great read...you won't be able to put it down."
4,Fascinating!,"This book is a fascinating look at the Internet before more than a handful of people even knew what the Internet was. The book is an exciting tale of espionage with a twist of science on top. I learned a lot about the Internet, yet the story wasn't compromised. I've read other ""computer stories"" and this is by far the best!"
5,Officially My Favorite Book Of All Time,"I first read this book when I was young. My father had it in hardcover. Being a true hacker, in the original sense of the word, this novel appealed to me greatly. Now being the owner of a small software developement company, I attribute some of my more advanced knowledge of computers to this book. The research I did due to some of the things in this book greatly advanced a lot of what I know.Clifford Stoll did a brilliant job writing this book. I still remember trying to contact him after first reading it, as the printed book had his email address listed."
5,A good read,"I only started on it two days ago. I have little time to read, yet I am half way though it. The story is awesome."
3,Good computer spy story,"I read the book and found it a very detailed and interesting computer spy story. My grandson, age 14 and very ""into"" computers, should find it interesting. The book portrays computer hackers as distructive villans."
5,Sweet,"I read the book and it was very interesting. I did find it to be a little drawn out, but all and all it was a pretty good read."
4,"Solid, not great, but very good","Very interesting. if you have to experience in Unix/linux, shell commends, and networking all of the little tidbits of code and commends that are used will be interesting (""Hey i have used that commend... I could write that Trojan..."" - Myself). Really shows the beginning stages of people using national and worldwide networks (internet). It also has its funny moments, got to love the shower scene. At times gets a little dull, running back and forth but overall READ IT."
4,Finding Things Out,"There's the story. It's got the hook of a spy thriller, only better, since it's true.And then, what comes through is the personality of the author. You get a better feel for this when you read his other books.He's inspiring in the same way that comes across in the book ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"" The best short works of Richard P. Feynman.Read it. Have fun. It just might influence your perspective on a boring job."
5,Incredible book,This is incredible. For non-geek is just a fun thriller but for those who use Unix this book is incredible. The facts in this make it even more emersive since unix geeks will understand the author/main character better and this book is a good way for system administrator to understand how black hat hacker's work.I'm reading it for a second time right now.Nic
5,True Computer-sleuth mystery for the technically ignorant.,"Berkeley astrophysicist Clifford Stoll is assigned tocomputer house-keeping chores to help ""earn his keep.""A seventy-five cent accounting discrepancy in billingcomputer time blossoms into a full-time cyber-spaceadventure which takes several years and spans oceans.How can a Berkeley academic face his peers while assistingthe FBI and CIA? Will the FBI and CIA even believe him?How will Clifford explain this to his department head? Whathappens to astrophysics? Can you really start out missingseventy-five cents and end up with spies? This true accountgave me a new appreciation for the disciplines of modernscience.An amusing and expert communicator, Stoll takes the readerinto the heart of the Internet and its Unix operatingsystems. Even the most technically ignorant will be able tofollow Stoll on his detective trail. How nice not to feelcomputer-stupid for once!"
3,interesting but...,"This book explains in great detail how early computer hacking was discovered and how US agencies responded to the threat. I was unfamiliar with this story and so, found it interesting. But it took a while to get into the story and the technical language of the computer world was sometimes difficult to follow. The book isn't written terribly well. Nevertheless, I'd recommend the book because of the interesting subject matter."
2,"Easy To Read, If Nothing Else","As a computer security case story, it is a pleasantly easy read, and Stoll generally succeeds at making a fairly dry and abstract matter readable to Joe Bloggs (i. e. me). Unfortunately this book is written along the lines of the American school of easy - to - read - yet - voluminous - enough - to - look - good - on - my - bookshelf writing, which means that two thirds are actually made up of inane stories of Clifford's personal life in which he essentially tries to sucker up to his readership -- ""check it out, I'm just such a whacky hippy"". Unfortunately, though not for lack of trying, he fails to concile his flower - power stance with his eager cooperation with some decidedly unmellow intelligence agencies. Which one is it going to be, Clifford -- snitch or freak? You can't have it both ways."
2,not for me,"I felt this book was a bit laboured and the potential reader needs to realise that while this book has a lot of good reviews it is gradually becoming dated. It does have a lot of Espionage and will appeal to people in InfoSec but as the years go by it's becoming a historical reference to the way things used to be , at least from a systems point of view. Also another negative hence my 2 stars is that it tends to drag on a bit for the first few chapters which left me annoyed at the pace of the unfolding plot.The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage"
2,Boring,"The Cuckoo's Egg, which is 399 pages long, is 360 pages of redundant boredom. The author narates the story of a hacker breaking into the Berkley system while the author follows the hacker's every and I mean every move. This drones on like an endless loop that culminates into an uneventfull catching of the guilty parties. Deceptively, the book jacket carries reviews of ""fascinating, intriguing and gripping."" Perhaps, if you never leave your house."
4,Fascinating book for people interested in computer networks,"This is an exciting and gripping story of a system administrator's life. One day, he discovers a hacker who is constantly breaking in into computer systems. When he begins to chase the hacker, he eventually finds out that it's not just some youth having fun reading other people's files. And you are going to hold your breath while following the administrator's every move.The book's well written and funny. Its philosophy is somewhat anarchist, as is usual for computer freaks, and pretty ironical towards the US government institutions. I'm glad to say that the hero, looking like just another leftist jerk in the beginning, goes through a significant attitude change when he realizes that there are countries much more evil than the United States of America."
5,The Cuckoo's Egg,My son had requested the book as part of his birthday gift. He finished the book and told me it was very good. I have not read the book yet.
4,Very enjoyable,"I purchased this book due to a suggestion by the instructors of a class I was attending for work. I received it on a Thursday and finished by by Saturday - and I am a slow reader. It threw in a twist when relating to the ""I'm a hippy so should I really be helping 'the man?'"" I definitely recommend this book."
3,Just okay,"These units work, more or less. I find they're not very accurate, and there seems to be no way to adjust the outdoor sensing device. The outdoor sensor is a standard La Crosse unit; plain white and not especially attractive - fortunately, it's easy to mount it high on a wall or elsewhere out of sight. It does poorly if it gets direct sunlight; it needs to be mounted in the shade. It's critical when installing that you follow the instructions, or the two readout units won't properly sync up to the sensor. Overall construction is about what you'd expect for the price: Plastic, reasonably sturdy, but by no means ""solid"" feeling. Unfortunately, you can also spend a great deal more and get that same quality, so these units definitely win a few points for at least not breaking the bank. However - don't go in with super-high expectations. They'll *more or less* do the job with some margin of error, but that's all."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"This is the second Weather Channel product I have bought . The first stopped working a year after I bought it....just after the warranty ran out! The second one I just purchased. When I took it out of the box and set it up, I realized that the crystal was broken and you could not read the time. I called customer service and they said some would call me back in 4 days! Yes...4 days!! I said...that is just GREAT! What great customer service. After 4 days I got a call back and they said I had to send in the old Weather Channel to get a new one. I said...let me get this right....you want me to spend $10 to ship something back to you that cost me a total of $18! NOT! I just threw the thing away. Stay away!"
1,LaCrosse Technology,We had a remote thermometer. Some of us live far enough North that the temp drops to -20deg.. This thermometer stops reading at that temp. When I ask what could be done they said we were on our own .don't bother with them there not worth it.
1,Waste of time,"I am not going to buy this, and having read it's reviews I shan't be buying the first or second season collections either. Even though I came to this product because I suddenly realised I should be able to buy ""Mad about you"" DVDs now and should be clicking on the ""Yes send me all of the Mad About You DVD collections"" button.Only apparently the first season is a poor quality release and Sony is otherwise screwing around with their customers by playing some sort of pointless bait and switch.If you're going to sell DVDs then the product should be of appropriate quality and if you're going to sell collections of a TV show you either sell collections of each season or, I only wish, a complete set of all episodes. Anything else is a waste of time and resources."
3,"...tell me why, we love this like we do...","o.k...so we bought season one and season two, patiently waiting for season three, because 'mad about you' is the best show ever on television...and, if sony wasn't a bunch of cowards, they could have easily released a disc with just interviews, insights, and bloopers, and we would have bought it, because we are that kind of fans...but this, this is just cheesy, and deserves only three stars because a) the brilliance of the show still deserves something(even if they didn't include their best episode, the 'what-if-they-never-met' classic), but 2)this collection is alot of rehash, trash, and just plain crass, in it's commercial explotation of those who have been faithful...and because i count myself as one of those, i will buy this, but reluctantly, and certainly with baited breath, in anticipation of the rest of the seasons in full..."
1,Where are the Other Seasons??,"Seasons 3 through 7. Where are they? I watched the show so I know they are ""out there"". I purchased the first two seasons, so I know they are ""out there"". Let me think, hmmmm Mad about You about two lovely people from NYC, in the midst of the 80's and seven seasons later, NO 3 through 7?? hmm, sounds like..............SONY!Funny one of the episodes in season 1, actually shows a Sony Playstation under the Television.. Even then we were forwarned.. Hey SONY!!! PUT OUT THE REST OF THE SEASONS.. Mad about you 3 through 7... wheeew, glad I got that off my chest. After all, it's not like I can walk down the block and get a copy of it from the PEDRO the CABANA BOY!!"
2,True fans want the whole series,"Sorry to see that after releasing complete season 1 & 2 sets they have decided to take this route, putting out a collection that supposedly represents the best episodes as chosen by Hunt and Reiser. This was an excellent sitcom in the early years and deserves a full release. And judging by the list of guest stars mentioned, the ""Collection"" will concentrate on the last couple of years, when the show had gone downhill and was trying to bring in the audience by bringing on big-name guest stars like Mel Brooks and Carol Burnett, rather than producing great episodes about Paul and Jamie."
2,What kind of release strategy is this?,"I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand what Sony has in mind with this upcoming release. They release season one with a low bit rate, inexpensive 2 disc set, then season two in a better quality 3 disc set and now they're doing a ""best of"" set that has Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt participating in some of the extras and commentaries. Why weren't they involved from the beginning and then just release the series season by season? Does mean that this new set is the final word on Mad About You and that we will see no more season sets? Will they continue with ""best of"" collections? It's a perplexing way to treat a classic television show.Before ""Friends"" was available in season collections they tried doing ""best of"" discs. I've noticed that those discs are now in the $5 pile at various electronics stores. Not exactly a ringing endorsement for this kind of format."
1,Do not Buy This,"I boycott this because they stop releasing Season 3 and, instead, release a set that includes shows from Seasons 1 and 2 that we fans already bought. They should just release season by season. Many fans are disappointed. I boycott this set to send a message to SONY, Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt that they should not jerk their fans around like that. Fans want to collect seasons by seasons in complete set with complete shows... not season 1, season 2 and highlights. Too bad a good series with talented Helen Hunt ended up like this."
4,I NEED Season 3 - COMPLETE!,"This collection has some good stuff, no question. But this cannot be the last word on Mad About You.Though I loved this series from start to finish, the show absolutely peaked in season three. If Sony wanted to release only one season of this classic series, it would have to be season three.Where is Escape From New York? (Clamenza!!) Where is Purseona? (Lisa's best episode ever) Where is Money Changes Everything? (Cyndi Lauper at her zaniest and Ira at his sweetest) Surely Paul and Helen consider these to be some of their favorites! C'mon...Purseona?!? Hello? Classic!Yeah, yeah, I'll still buy it. But I want another release with Season 3, Complete!"
3,Still waiting for the complete release of all episodes,"In the early 90 I had still to get hooked to a sitcom, then came Mad about you. I have taped most of the episodes not to miss any of it, but I never kept theese tapes since I wanted to buy it top quality when available. I jumped on season 1 and 2 but I am still waiting for the other releases. I don't want the best of it, I want it all! And I am sure I am not the only one!"
1,Mad About Sony,"WHAT IS GOING ON?!!! I'm from Brazil, already bought the previous seasons, and now Sony decides not to release the rest? That's outrageous! A ""Best Episodes Box"" is an offense to costumers all over the world. Brazilians love this show and are just as upset as americans about all of this. Trump should buy Sony just to fire the person responsible! I hope Sony releases the rest of the seasons, even if it's just for those who are asking for it! About the ""Best Episodes Box"", throw it on the company's garbage!"
1,Release All Seasons,"I purchased Seasons 1 and 2, and have been looking for Season 3 ever since. As so many others, I love this show and would love the opportunity to buy each season. Sony's not interested in what the fans want; and I'm not interested in buying a half-twit marketing idea."
1,A Review From Someone Who Actually Owns the Product,"I got this as a birthday present, because I am a big ""MAY"" fan. I thought, ""Oh, wow! A 'best of' collection!!!"" But the episodes are badly chosen, and only a few of my favorites are included. Also, so many are the ones Paul Reiser obviously thought were his best as auteur, so we are presented with way too many that are too fussy or too serious, including the three- (Lord help us) part episode where the Buchmans' marriage is put to the test (Gosh, don't we all want to watch all of THAT again?!!), and the ""New Frontier in sitcoms? Not so much"" episode where Paul and Jamie sit outside the bedroom door agonizing over whether or not to go in because the baby is crying.I'd recommend buying sets for separate seasons and just watching the ones you want, unless you think Paul Reiser was the Orson Welles of the 1990s, as Reiser apparently does. (The box says he and Helen Hunt chose the episodes, but you know Helen picked maybe two.)"
1,Mad About this scam,"By definition, the people buying the dvds are loyal fans. We'll be willing to buy ALL of the seasons, but they want to make an extra buck. None of us are stupid; we don't want to buy a small selection of episodes- we want all of them."
1,"Edited, 19 to 20 Minute Episodes","What a disappointment. Most of the episodes are 20 minutes in length, with several running a dismal 19 minutes in length. Reiser and Hunt take this enormous amount of time before each episode to discuss the importance and significance of the episode with a university professor; yet, they approve chopping almost 4 minutes from each episode. It doesn't make sense. Don't waste your money or time. Amazon was very good about allowing me to send this birthday present back for a full refund. Sony, Paul Reiser, and Helen Hunt should be ashamed of this release."
3,Twilight of the sitcom,"Folks, if you have not yet noticed, the brave and ugly new world of reality TV, including the gritty (make that macabre) new breed of reality inspired dramas like ER, Law and Order, CSI, Third Watch, 24, etc..., has burgeoned like a tumor on network prime time and the shelves of electronic media stores alike--at the expense of the sitcom format we have known and loved. No audience, no market, no product. It appears that we fans of Mad About You, and the like, are becoming a disenfranchised minority. Soon, I fear, we may have to choose between watching beautiful people suffer real degradations, like retching while eating bugs for dollars, and tuning the networks out entirely. Say, has anybody read a good book lately?"
2,Mad About You Collection,"My memories of this show were very good... but I regret buying this collection. In my opinion they are not the best picks out of the seasons. They are also not in chronological order, which gets frustrating. I find this box set depressing. Or maybe back when the shows were being made I was just darn easier to entertain."
4,Mad Not To!,"For those MAY fans this collection is a must! It's disappointing that the creators decided not to make the whole series a box set however, this collection of episodes sum up the quality of the show that was Mad About You."
1,Where is Season Three???,"I, and many, many other fans of this widely popular series have been patiently waiting month after month for the release of Season 3. It is so terribly disappointing and frustrating to watch shows like Friends and Frasier release season after season, with no sign of the equally entertaining and popular Mad About You seasons on the horizon. I cannot imagine what is going through the minds of the executives who made the decision NOT to continue releasing a DVD collection which would make them a huge amount of money. On behalf of broken hearted fans everywhere, who are just waiting to run out and buy Season 3, 4, 5, etc...WHERE ARE THEY?!?!"
1,"I agree they should release season 3, 4 etc.","I agree with all the other fans, I never got a chance to watch all the eposides in order, so I was excited to see that Mad About You was released & now I find out that Sony ended it at season 2. That is stupid!I was looking forword to seeing what I missed. I hope that somehow thisgets to Sony so that they know that fans want to see all the seasons."
2,The same as the other reviewers...,"I've got the same complaints as everyone else...my only point in posting was to amplify the opinions of the others.This was a multi-award winning show that was loved by many...but yet we're only allowed access to the first 2 seasons? Watching the commentaries is fun, but we don't need a ""best of;"" we need the third season already!"
1,I want the complete series..,What a waste of time and money ..I've been waiting to collect the complete series instead getting this garbage from Sony..WHEN WILL THEY RELEASE THE SEASON 3??? WHAT KIND OF STRATEGY THEY USED STUPID SONY ?
1,Mad About Sony,"I think it is crazy to say that the previous two seasons had slow sales and therefore Sony is releasing this set to ""test the waters"" about further sets. That sounds like a stupid studio decision for sure. I for one will NOT buy this set.If they are going to put the money into releasing a set that will ""test the waters for a 3rd season"", then just release the 3rd season!!! Seems like simple common sense to me. They're spending the money for a release either way. Why spend it to slap the fans in the face instead of giving them what they want.Oh, that's right, nobody knows less about what the public wants to see than the studio execs. Too bad they make the calls... Hopefully the idiot that made this call is calling unemployment!!!"
1,Mad about you,"Don't waste your money,If you want ALL THE EPOSIDES.DON'T BUY IT.IT IS NOT COMPLETE.I WAS DISSAPOINTED."
2,Not meant to be shipped,"The problem here was that the product came broken in several pieces even though the box it came in was very well packaged. I don't think the box from the manufacturer has the terracotta dish packed well enough for individual shipment, no matter how well amazon wraps the box up in bubble wrap (the terracotta is much thinner than a standard terracotta pot for plants). The item was so broken that I was not able to test it, so I cannot comment on its mosquito repellent qualities. If you really want to try this product, I recommend buying it in a store and making sure the pot is not broken before buying."
3,Does not ship well,The ceramic holder will likely break during shipping from amazon. I just went to a local store to exchange it. Works well for repelling the skeeters and does not smell too bad. Can be put out and started again later if needed. Sure beats bug spray!
2,Ineffective,"These don't appear to have any effect on the local mosquito population, and I am using Off brand coils. So, just as many mosquito bites + the unpleasant smell from the coil. This product is a failure."
3,Still unsure,The coils work great but they seem a little small. i'm still using it but it seems like it'll burn out faster than other normal mosquito coils. I could be wrong but from what I've seen this will probably be the case. The terracotta holder it comes with is pretty though.
1,"Foghorn, foghorn","Singing? Blaring ""Heartache heartache"" like an off key foghorn is more like it.Her twitchy awkward singing performance on late night tv made me cringe. She looked like Mick Jagger in drag with 2x4 inserted in an uncomfortable place. I thought she might be having a seizure.And although I know this review will not be considered helpful by most people, what is the deal with people marking every negative review as ""not helpful"". Not helpful to whom? There were some really insightful, thoughtful but negative reviews marked as not helpful."
2,I can't believe she sang that!,"How do I begin, Kathie Lee please go back to Live! You are so good there and so average here. The only song that is likely to be played on top 40 is Love Never Fails. This is Pop music, very catchy but could be sang by anyone with a decent voice. Heartache, Heartache is so bad that I can't watch her perform it on one more show. She is trying to get the Celine Dion fans while also capturing the Shania Twain fans and it doesn't work. Yes she looks good for 47 but 17 she is not and all the tight jeans and no bras won't get her on the top 40 list with Heart of A Woman."
1,This woman has no heart - or voice,"I actually listened to the whole CD. It was a painful experience, as KathieLee has spent so much energy into the Marketing and promotion of this CD that she forgot she needed to train her voice to actually sing. All of the songs are in the same octave, she has absolutely no range, and its really embarassing (can you imagine being Frank now?) watching her on every show she can get on for self-promotion. And whats with dressing like a 14 year old? Just shows you how totally out of touch with reality overpaid and over-ego'd famous people get. Lets face it KathiLee has no heart - or voice, she just needs to stay in the spotlight."
1,Kathie Lee - The Family Joke,"Let me tell you how just bad this album is:Ever since its release, it has been passed on from one family member to another as the biggest joke of our Christmas season. And what joy it brings us! Whoever is stuck it each year must play at least one cut, prefereably the screaming ""Heartache"", and we all fall to the floor in gales of laughter. It's truly the highlight of the Christmas season for us all.Thank you, Kathie Lee!"
1,Give It A Rest Kathie Lee!,"I am almost embarrassed for the poor woman when I hear and see her promote this new CD. Singing does not seem to come naturally to her. It's such an effort. The song Heartache, Heartache is truly an Earache, Earache. I would not recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys good music."
4,Heart of a Woman,"I really think this is a great project for Kathie lee. I think she out did herself on this. I am so disappointed that other people are not giving it a chance. I own a business and play it alot, and the people love it. So really trying to promote it for her. I really like ""Love Never Fails"", but she does need to do a remix for it. Get it in the dance clubs! I also love ""Make My Day"" and ""We Don't Make Love Anymore"" and the remix of ""The Hardest Part"" It's a cd to either work out to or make love to.....Thank you Kathie Lee"
3,Good pop album,"I remembered hearing this album 5 years ago in 2000 and thought that Kathie Lee Gifford made a good effort. Most of the album consists of midtempo pop, but there are a few dance numbers within. Kathie Lee sounds more free and confident on these songs than the conservative feel of her inspirational albums. The Ernie Lake/Cox songs that were written for this album fits with her style. There are just two songs here that sound dull and bland. Although it did not achieve the sales success that she wanted, this is a very creative pop album that shows Kathie Lee being a better singer than before."
3,Please Tell Kathie to sing something else,"Mainly a Regis fanatic I have always wanted to hear Kathie Lee sing and was instantly not surprised that KL has no and I mean NO talent for pop music. I liked her albums Born For You and the wonderful It's Christmas Time holiday album and now those are the types of albums that is simply simply simply good. I bought this album because I liked the song The Hardest Part and since I bought it I memorized that whole song and it's the only listenable track on the whole dang album. I'm currently am buying another copy because mine got suddenly scratched when I bought it. My advice save your money and buy any cd by Melissa Manchester who's cds i'll recommend are wonderful and include the following, Melissa Manchester-Don't Cry Out Loud, Melissa Manchester-Tribute, Melissa Manchester-The Essence Of Melissa Manchester, If you're looking for a better voice than Kathie Lee's listen to these albums and believe me you will be shocked,Hope This Review Helps,HOTSEAT"
1,It's all about her,"This is supposed to be a pop album but the songs are the same old slow, stuff she put out before. She continues to sing about herself as if the whole world revolves around her. There does not appear to be any originality and most songs sound like her prior albums, drab. Of course the title refers to her life which she assumes applies to all women as appears to be thier spokesperson on life."
1,Kathie Lee Gifford = Cruel and Unusual Punishment,Who ever can actually sit through Kathie Mee Gifford's warbling has all the respect in the world from me. I can barely sit through five seconds of just looking at the woman without laughing AT her or wanting to vomit.
1,"Not my cup of tea, too weak for me.","Wanted to love this album, but I couldn't hum a few bars now after listening to each song a couple times. I found ""Heartache"" annoying. A bit of Shania Twain, but she's the only one who can sing it. All of the other songs sounded the same to me, I couldn't quote you a line from any. I buy music to ""feel"" something or to find myself ""dancing in my seat"". This CD left me with a case of the blahs."
1,Milli Vanilli sang better than Kathie Lee,"Of course Milli Vanilli lipsynched. Kathie Lee should take a cue from that ill-fated duo and lipsynch to someone who CAN sing. Listening to her music would be considered ""cruel and unusual punishment"" for anyone. I wouldn't torture my worst enemies with this cd. They don't deserve that much pain. Of course I could always use a coaster but then again that would help with Kathie Lee's record sales and that I won't do."
1,Warning!!Contents Will Prove Harmful!!,"While Kathie Lee Gifford never failed to use every opportunityafforded her while a talk show host to croon a tune, she should have left the real singing to the experts. In attempt to further her public persona, she's moved from the sappy standards she once sang to sappy adult contemporary, with utterly disastrous results. She even tacks on a remix of one of the many awful ballads found within this hodgepodge of misery. Only'Love Never Fails' shows the faintest glimmer of personality, and it's a complete carbon copy of Celine Dion's far superior 'That's The Way It Is'. Her singing is barely average, her voice so nondescript that such typically soul-challenged divas as Mariah Carey and Jessica Simpson now look like havens in the neverending emotionless storm that is this record. After hearing this record, you won't help but fall to your knees andpray ""Come back Celine, all is forgiven""."
4,PRETTY DAM GOOD,"I'M SO CLAD I BOUGHT THE HEART OF A WOMAN CD. MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE IT. WE HAVE BOUGHT MANY OF KATHIE CD'S AND THEY ARE ALL GOOD.WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY THINK THE CD STINKS, I THINK THEY ARE TALKING THREW THIER A--. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK KATHIE LEE."
1,this is way to funny,"i got to hear this through a friend of mine&I laughed so hard.first of all she can't sing.secondly what's up with being the dressed up version of Mariah Carey?3rd she is a poor Celine Dion Cher 3rd tier knock off at best.her voice has no emotion or depth.i guess with money&nothing else better to do with her time she drops a CD?if she is lucky she may be a trivia question on who wants to be a millionaire? hopefully no one will remember this set.i still trip on my friend about this.i think she is a babe, better suited for modeling or hosting a show but please no more music."
2,HEY LOOK BRITTNEY'S MOM MADE A CD!!,"Where to start? It's not that Kathie Lee has a bad voice, she doesn't, it's just that it's better suited for standards. Here she makes a vallant effort at ""pop"" music, unfortunately it ain't always pretty. The ballads are rather underwhelming. Why each one must begin with a hummed intro is beyond me. The title cut and ""The Hardest Part"" are actually descent. However, ""Heartache,Heartache"" is a reeeaaalll bad Shania Twain-esque tune that is destined to become a camp classic. All in all a pretty bland collection that would have never seen the light of day by any other ""artist""."
1,BAD!,"The only thing that she seems to be good at is dishing out sarcasm. She certainly can't sing, and I presume act. Enough all ready!"
1,Forget about this one,"This CD is a real disappointment. Kathy Lee has the most ""forced"" voice that I have heard. She trying to sound like everyone else out there and failing miserably. It is really sad. She should stick to the religious music and leave the rest to ""real"" singers. Its over, Kathy Lee, let it go!"
1,Kathie Lee won't find her niche in pop music.,"I was excited about this album because I'm a Kathie Lee fan. I honestly feel that fans will be let down by this album. The songs are typical, non-descript, and don't capture the listener. You know how sometimes you buy an album and there is only one hit song, and the others are all dull and forgettable? Well, this whole album sounds like that. The worst one of all is Heartache. Kathie Lee keeps up the autobiographical subject matter like ""We don't make love anymore"" which may help her communicate with her husband, but it doesn't really give the listener much to ENJOY. Her fame will sell records, but the lack of enjoyment will keep this off the hit list. Kathie Lee has a great voice, but she doesn't quite deliver with this album. Save your money!!"
4,PRETTY DAM GOOD,"I'M SO CLAD I BOUGHT THE HEART OF A WOMAN CD. MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE. WE HAVE BOUGHT MANY OF KATHIE CD'S AND THEY ARE ALL GOOD.WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY THINK THE CD STINKS, I THINK THEY ARE TALKING THREW THIER A--. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK KATHIE LEE."
5,Solid work-out!,"This is a good and solid work-out dvd with the great instructions, attitude and motivation one has come to expect from Janis Saffell. In this dvd she is working together with Scott Cole, Tai Chi Master. Janis and Scott refer to the work out as the Jing/Yang, which is very true. I feel very good, emotionally, after I have done this work out even though I am not sweating in the same way as after a regular kick-boxing class. For approx. 54 minutes Janis and Scott alternate between tai chi moves and classic kick-boxing moves. Even though I was not working up a great sweat, I still felt every part of my body afterwards. I highly recommend this as an addition to your work-out library. I do this dvd about 1-2 times a week."
3,Okay...,"The workout was a little slow for me. I really like the Advanced Tae Bo and some other faster workout like that. It is pretty focused, it just doesn't really seem like it gets you moving for a long time because you are going back and forth between Tai Chi and Kickboxing. Overall, it was ok. It's good if you want to do a slow controlled workout or if you want to work on technique."
1,Nearly put me to sleep!,"I bought 4 DVDs in this series, because I had heard the name ""Stott"" often in relation to Pilates. I was looking forward to solid instruction and moderately challenging exercises. To say I was sorely disappointed would be an understatement. I have had a difficult time getting through these workouts even once each, not because they are difficult, but because they are so incredibly slow paced and boring. Stott talks in a monotone throughout, and it took great effort to stay focused on the workout. Very, very boring! I would definitely not recommend these workouts unless you like following an instructor who is just barely above comatose energy."
2,Good but not for long,"I Bought the pressure washer new in 2010, used it to wash ATVs a few times a year. Worked very well, then all of a sudden motor would run, but no pressure, would never build enough to shut pump off with trigger closed. I took it apart and checked all the basics, must be bad pump. Got 3 years of occasional use on a inexpensive pressure washer .... fair deal overall."
1,poor quality - 1 year old and now no pressure,"gonna keep it short - bought it, used it a few times, now no pressure. Motor spins, but no pressure when i pull trigger - figure foreign object, rust or just wear on the pump innards....gonna buy a good gas powered one next time."
5,"A ""must-read"" before setting out to parts unknown","Award-winning author Bruce Whipperman brings his first-hand experience in sunny Acapulco to the pages of Moon Handbooks Acapulco, discussing the secluded beaches, bustling crafts market, historic highland towns and more that pepper this vibrant land. From how to pack for paradise (water purifying tablets are a must) to basic information for those curious in making a permanent investment (avoid timeshares, and while Mexican law prohibits foreign ownership of many properties it is possible to have control of land through a trust) to directions for the best accomodations and food, sights and special celebrations, a brief Spanish phrase guide, internet resources for further research, and much more. A ""must-read"" before setting out to parts unknown."
3,"Good, but a let down","I remember when I was listening to Dice tearin up the mic on the roots albums, and it got me psyched to cop this joint. It is not Raw at his dopest. The beats are not satisfying but alot of the lyrics are tight. For all of you who bought the Roots albums this should be in your collection just to prove to you that although the Roots never fail, their allies do not always live up to standards. Although the beats from Cosmic Kev are far from great, this kid rhymes well. This album was okay, but you may as well cop the albums from the roots, and listen for Dice there. Hope the sophmore effort is good."
4,"Dice Raw, Not Dice Soft","Well For all Of you who have waiting for Dice to bless the MIC, here it is. The album is full of hard knockin Joints, however production on the album could have been tighter. Check out the joint ""locked down"" it really explains what underground astist go through these days (Black Thought is the Illest). If you love Hip Hop this album is for you. If you Like Rap KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF better go check out Jay-Z. Support Underground Hip Hop. One Love,Compressed Compound A.K.A. Prototype"
3,These glasses are fine,Typical 3m quality and are fine for most of the work I do...........Typical 3m quality and are fine for most of the work I do........
4,Cheap and they work,"For just a couple of bucks, these are hard to beat. I wouldn't trust them to protect your retinas from the suns rays, but for using the miter saw or nailing, they are great. Mine came clear by mistake I assume, but the glasses are the same as the tinted ones. I just don't look as cool. They have a comfortable fit and some style."
3,Detroit Love,"I had to get this album because I heard Frank N Dank on the Welcome to Detroit CD and they blew it up. I'm suprised that this was not put out commercially. Frank N Dank have skills, not lyrical but they can with out a doubt hold up their own in the hip-hop ring. This CD is a really good CD through and through for anybody who loves hip hop. And the production by Jay Dee is real good, the brotha ain't going to loose his style. I can't wait til they make a commercial debut."
2,Just doesn't cut it.,"I ordered as a file box - and it isn't proportioned for that. It was very difficult to assemble, the top drawer doesn't close, it is extremely heavy and made with shoddy materials. Way to much for this piece of junk. I use it for my granddaughter's small toys. Don't buy this product you will feel ripped off."
1,Just the Worst Junk,"Don't waste your time on this product or any of their line. I bought 3 at a price of $19.99 each. Why this particular one is over $40, I don't know. The pieces are all cut wrong. Out of the 3 I purchased, I was able to get enough pieces together to make 2 full cubes. The directions are terrible and the sliders don't fit into the holes. You have to pound them in, and since the sliders are made of plastic, breakage is very likely. Once you get them together, the drawers don't slide well and it's hard to shut the drawer all the way because of the mis-cut pieces. When the drawer is open all the way, the cube wants to tip over, so if you are wanting a single cube, you'll have to secure it to the wall or floor.I don't usually write reviews, but this product is so inferior, that I just had to give a warning."
5,Well-made and BPA-FREE! Great for kiddo snacks!,"These popsicle molds are very well-made, durable, and sized perfectly for toddlers and children. .Here are the highlights:1) Popsicles can be removed one at a time2) Material is sturdy and strong3) Dishwasher safe (top rack)4) BPA-free and safe for kiddos!The Tovolo popsicle molds (lots of different shapes are available) are wonderful and make fantastic, healthy snacks for kiddos!"
5,Best Popsicle Mold,I've bought two sets now that I saw that my first ones worked so well. I always get a lot of compliments from adults and kids from all the popsicles I make with these molds. They always work great when you run them under hot water for about 10 seconds before pulling out. Perfect mold! Happy mama!
3,Rocket Pops,"I bought this popsicle set thinking that my son and I would enjoy making homeade popsicles. I thought that it would save money and make it a healthier option. The popsicles themselves are a little larger than I pictured, which is usually a good thing, unless you have a toddler who does not eat a popsicle very fast. The plastic is fairly sturdy, but I do not like the standing rack in the freezer. It does take up a lot of space, which I guess if you wait for the popsicles to freeze, you can move them around but until then...I found that if you rinsed the outside in warm/hot water, the popsicles were fairly easy to remove. Overall satisfied with the product, maybe not appropriate for my toddler, for now."
4,Very pleased,"Got these because my son loves popsicles. He is very excited to make his own popsicles! The molds do take a little wiggling to get out, but not too tough. The plastic is sturdy and withstands the pressure required to get the pop out."
4,Big Rocket Pops,"I have this popsicle mold. It makes pretty big popsicles. (Too big for my toddler to finish, so he usually sets them down somewhere random and makes a mess.) The popsicle are a little hard to get out of these molds, but not impossible. The set takes up a lot of room in the freezer. It's nice to be able to take out one pop mold instead of have to thaw out the whole set at once, though. Also the drip tray on the sticks is a little shallow and tends to drip juice on your shirt if it gets too full. Other than that it seems pretty durable and is easy to fill and transport to the freezer. The stick is pretty long - you could do two different flavors, but not more than that and still get the stick frozen into the popsicle.My son likes to make popsicles with juice, milk, yogurt or just plain water!"
4,Nice pops,"I like these popsicle sticks. I had a bit of difficulty figuring out which way to put them together, but other than that they are fine."
3,?????,What can be said about this product. They make pop-cycles. Kind of awkward getting that last 1 inch so have the kids eat that outside.
2,"look okay, but really drip badly!","When the juice from the pop melts, it just drips into the base and just drips constantly. really wouldn't recommend them. Better to choose ones that the bottom can come off of, and the pop just stays on the stick itself."
2,Rocket Pop Mess,"Plastic mold is nice quality but the design of the handle piece make it a drippy mess midway through eating the popsicle. I always have to change my daughter's clothes because her shorts are a mess. Even using a bib, it's still not enough to catch the drips that melt and stay in the bottom lip of the blue handle piece. When your toddler lifts and tips the popsicle to suck on it, the melted contents in the handle piece drip out of the handle and onto your toddler. They're ok until the popsicle starts to melt. Then you need to refreeze it before the mess starts. Or try to get your toddler to hold a cup or small bowl under their chin while sucking away on the popsicle."
3,These are ok but not spectacular,"In all fairness to this product, I have yet to encounter a fantastic Popsicle mold. However, just like other reviewers have noticed, the anti-drip mechanism guarantees that you will inadvertently dump a puddle of melted Popsicle on your shirt while eating them, and it's hard to open them without running them under hot water for a while, which just adds to the melti-ness. Also, the rocket shape isn't really ideal for consuming them, as the width makes it tough to get to the bottom half. Finally, they take up a lot of space in the freezer. I am underwhelmed."
4,Great set,"Great little popsicle set. Works well, seems sturdy. Takes a little effort to extract the frozen popscicle from the sleeve, but I believe that to be the same with any of these devices. Warm water on the outside of the sleeve does the trick pretty well.The handle also acts as a little basin to catch drips. Good choice overall."
2,Cute but hard to get out,"I bought these in red from a local retailer. I love that they come on a little tray, and I think the pops are so cute when you get them out of the mold. IF you can get them out of the mold. The little cap/stick part is very difficult to separate from the mold once you have an ice pop frozen in there. You have to run the pop under hot water for several seconds to get it to the point where you can pry the top off, and even then it's a struggle. I've broken fingernails trying to pry the sticks off the molds, and I've snapped two of the plastic sticks in half trying to get them out."
1,Why are there so many positive reviews of this product?!?,"I bought the Tovolo Blue Rocket Pop Molds based on the customer reviews. I was expecting them to work great and be user friendly. Boy, was I wrong! First, I tried making popsicles out of an ice cream mixture. It was a total disaster. The popsicle sticks would come right out of the mold, without the popsicle! (Yes, I let them freeze overnight!) The Tovolo popsicle molds apparently don't work well with milk, yogurt, or ice cream mixtures. If you are planning on making creamy popsicles, I suggest you buy a different mold. I also tried to make fruit juice popsicles and soda pop popsicles. Both of them froze so hard it was impossible to get them out of the mold, even after running them under hot water! I even had my strong-armed fiance try to get them out. He couldn't do it either! Both the fruit juice and the soda popsicles would not release from the mold until they were half melted! What a huge disappointment."
3,Stick comes out without the popsicle,"I just got these in the mail and have only used them once so far. The box says to let freeze for 4 hours. After 8 hours, all 6 of the popsicles wouldnt come out. The stick came out without the popsicles. And i have read other reviews on here where the same thing happened.So we had to dig it out and eat it with a kitchen knife.I used green tea, and also grape juice ones. Both liquids were frozen hard, but the stick came out without the popsicle.I was looking forward to making frozen smoothie pops, or pudding or yogurt pops. But if this happens with watery liquid, then the stick for sure wont come out if i try these creamy things.Otherwise they are nice. Fun to fill up. Stand up in the freezer without spilling.But now i have resorted to just freezing a small bowl of green tea or grape juice and eating it with a spoon, instead of using these rocket pop molds."
4,Daughter loves these!,"My daughter loves these. They are bigger than I thought they would be. My only small complaint is sometimes it's harder than other times to get the mold off the base, but that is my only complaint. I would still buy these again. The shipping was fast too. Thanks!"
4,"Great popsicles, but they do leak","These popsicle molds are great and with a little warm water run on the outside they come out with no problems at all. I do have one beef though. They claim that the holder makes it so it doesn't spill on you.......well, trust me, it does and actually makes it worse than the ones that only have the stick.At least with the stick handle kind you can cover your bases and get the drips with your mouth. The cup at the end prevents you from doing this and when you tilt it to go in your mouth all the drips that accumulated in the cup go all over your shirt. Maybe I will have to leave more space than it says at the end so I can still get my tongue under the rocket bottom to catch the drips before they accumulate.Still a great popsicle mold and just the right size for adults or kids. Not too big, not too small...just right."
3,Broken after a few uses,We have only had these a few months and already 2 of them are broken (at the base of the holder). It is also very difficult to get the covers off and requires using too much water to release them.
3,Good price for summer fun,It's not too expensive to have some summer fun with kids at home. The set of 6 is easy to use and clean. One can easily prepare the liquid to produce homemade pops.
3,"loved them, but one stick broke",We just got ours and I was so happy. We use the yo baby yogurt and fruit juice mixed. My son dropped one and the stick broke very easily. A little dissapointed because now we have a short set and they are very exspensive just to replace one missing :(
2,Meh....I was disappointed with these.,"My Rocket Pops seem to be a more evolved version of these....no tray, each one can stand on its own.The quality is good. They are sturdy and easy to fill and freeze.But I found them hard to eat. The narrow bit at the top is easy, but the bottom (where most of the edible stuff is) is hard to get at. If you try and eat from the top you choke yourself on the thick centerpiece, and if you try eat from the side, the flat base gets in the way. In addition to that, between the thick stick in the middle and the rocket indentations, there's not a lot of space left for frozen stuff. I felt like there was a lot of fuss with little reward, but kids might like them. I will most likely replace them with a more conventional pop shape."
5,AMAZING mitt,very satifying its comfterble and sleek good buy.if youre buying a mitt this is a must have!!!!
3,An OK CD...,"If you're looking for hits from 2000, these CD is about half-filled with them. Nelly's ""Country Grammar,"" Effiel 65's ""Blue (Da Ba Dee),"" and Three Doors Down's ""Kryptonite"" are all definitely worthy of being called ""Smash Hits."" However, at least half of this CD contains songs that were NOT smach hits - heck, they weren't even MODEST hits!I advise you look over the track listing and decide if enough hits are included. Otherwise, look to hits packages such as ""Totally Hits 2001"" and the ""Now!"" series."
3,Just OK.,"OK, some of the tracks on this CD are pretty good. But others, I can do without. The best tracks are numbers 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 13, 17, and especially, 18. The rest aren't that great and ones you can skip over. This complication CD is mostly R&B, Rap, and Rock hits. So if you're looking for Pop or Latin hits, then this is NOT the CD to get (get CDs from the NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC! series, instead). But if you like this kind of music, than this is definitely the CD to get. But pretty decent for a CD complication."
4,Excellent film of another time and a lost place,"One can read the other reviews for the plot synopsis. I would only add that I found this movie to be as much about a certain place (the title) as about a love story. We see the lives and interconnectedness of these people through the eyes of the young woman who must out of necessity live with them.This movie is well-worth the effort, and could be a very good introduction to foreign language films for those who shy away from them.I guess I reserve 5 stars for all-time classics, but Zelary really is a great movie -- poignant and touching.One more point: Although I'm not Catholic, I was gratified to see a priest portrayed as a devout yet human person and not a hypocritical or ineffectual jackass."
4,Chech Saga,A story of sexy urban nurce turned to be a peasant in the Tatres while hiding from Nazis looking for partisans she was among.An interesting work for distant from a region viewers especially.
5,A Great WWII Love Story 1940s Czechoslovakia,"What happens when a woman from an elitist background finds herself intertwined in a resistance movement, which implicates her in activities that if caught, will convict her to doom at the hands of the Nazis?The survivor, Eliska is saved thanks the protection of the lowly laborer and mill worker, the lovable Joza who promises to hide her in his close-nit village tucked high away in the mountains. It is this odd couple -through unusual and unfortunate circumstances - who find trust, companionship, and love amidst threats of invasion and capture by the Nazis.Others have done an excellent job summarizing the plot line and specifics of this story. Yet, I would recommend this story, solely for the breathtaking cinematography and gorgeous scenic views where this love story unfolds.I rate Zelary as one of the best foreign film love stories of the 20th century. I am confident that you will agree and view it time and again.Maizie Lucille JamesMay 29, 2010"
5,Zelary movie,"This was A VERY good movie. If you only watch one foreign film in a year, put this one in your basket."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A hilarious comedy that deserves praise for its reluctance to fall back upon a single joke, Only Human continually reinvents itself in its sucessful quest to make us laugh; with hilarious sitations and well-drawn characters, it's a successful comedy that only gets funnier the more you know about the Palestinian-Jewish conflict."
1,donot waste your time on this one,This book is totally without any redeeming quality. It starts slow and plods along to the end at a snails pace. Boring!
3,A very tedious read...,"I started reading this book hoping for an awesome romance set in my favorite time period, the Middle Ages. What I found was an overdone history lesson and no romance. I'm sure it picks up somewhere but I just didn't have the patience. If you love a lot of history and political intrigue in a book, then this one is for you. I personally could not get past the 100th page."
5,Wonderfull!!!,This is one of those books that you read once a year every year. It is a magnificent book and i recomend it highly to anyone who loves this author. It is different and unique and the characters are complex. I read some of the less flattering reviews and i dissagree strongly.
3,Dragged along.....,"I wanted to like this book. It was well researched. However, a lot of the book felt like a history dump of information. Pages of what was going on at the time felt like it was taken directly from a history manual. While it was interested it really didn't feel tied into the story. The actual story was only ho hum and dragged on and on. The couples encounters were aggravatingly repetitive and boring. Overall though the book had potential it really fell below the mark in a lot of areas. If you love history more than the storyline and characters of a romance you might like this book. However, if you want a touch of accurate history and a richly woven tapestry of the time and characters you'll want another read."
3,Not her best,"This story was a fun romp through a special time in history. However, the first love story that starts the plot seems to come from an act of violence. Not my cup of tea. She has written better books."
3,More stubborn people.,The jumps from the past the brought this couple together to the current action were hard to follow in the early parts of the book. Eventually it all comes together and you can understand their differing points of view better. She is blindly loyal to a vow made to her mother and he is driven by his duty to the King. Their ups and down seem a little far fetched.
4,Okay,It was a short read. The conflict between the main charactersFelt slightly forced at times. Overall not too bad for the price.
3,Silly escapism,"It's silly, entertaining fluff, kind of like a harlequin romance. Mindless escape, which is fun sometimes, but not satisfying as a steady diet.."
5,Heather Graham book The King's Pleasure,Any book that Heather Graham has written is top of the line reading and I love it. I especially like having it in ebook form.
4,"Captiavating storyline, wonderfully romantic",Enjoyed the storyline that involves numerous characters and a love that is destined to be.
4,well written story!,"I liked the characters, the historical significancy, the locations and the royals from both England and France. The ending was perfect/"
5,Extremely well-written,I have read many novels of this era and this one is certainly one of the best. Loved the engrossing storyline and how the plot is weaved. A really good read.
4,The King's Pleasure,"Was a very good book and followed with more good stories, I liked the details on the other people in the lifes of both main charaters"
4,The King's Pleasure,"Really like this author, and this book is really good so far, I have not finished it yet but still working on it!"
3,"so, So",Not really a good book. I don't read it every night. Just want to finish it. and order another one.
1,The King's Pleasure by Heather Graham,"The title says it all -- what was I thinking? I grew tired of ""the King's pleasures"" after watching all of the episodes of The Tudors, and this title should have been a clue. Poorly written and certainly didn't hold my interest -- but I am a former English teacher and my standards are high."
4,History at its best,"If you are a true historical romance reader, then you will definitely enjoy the compelling history, however, the love story in itself is somewhat annoying and confusing. Adrienne is a hero that every woman will love. Strong, masculine, confident, yet gentle when necessary, and devoted to both his king and adversary of a wife. Danielle, I found to be 'stupid'. She was raised by an English king, yet she would betray her loving huband and her king in order to keep a vow she made to her mother, a vow she did not fully understand. However, since I'm a fan of the typical genre of 'relunctant brides and grooms', I enjoyed the bantering between the two. The 'King's Pleasure' is not one of the best, however, few historical romances are written involving this particular Platagenet and that in itself is refreshing. On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this book a low 4 or a high 3 1/2 stars."
2,"Well written, but disappointing.","I found the book well written as far as everything but the love story! These two don't become lovers until after page 200 and then the heroine of the story spends almost the entire book (until the very end) fighting her feelings for the hero, being unbelievably defiant, actually a traitor to the hero and his king, and yet he can't help but love her! I really did not enjoy this book; Ms. Drake (a/k/a Heather Graham) usually writes a better love story."
1,Don't know why,"Too bouncy, going from one thing to another. Could not identify with anything in the book. Too graphic for my taste."
2,Not Great,"I thought the writing was great and flowed well. However the instances of rape left a bad taste in my mouth, historically correct or not."
4,Good Read,A good historical romance back in the days of kings. Kept my interest and I enjoyed it to the end. Not quite good enough for a 5 star rating but still it was worth reading.
4,Good Historical Novel,It was a good another good book from Graham. Thought the history infused into the tale was interesting. The main two characters were certainly stubborn in their own ways! Wonder if there could be a sequel?
2,not for me,too much sexy stuff in a historical novel. No doubt it could have happened . i just don't want my stories overtaken by it.
4,Courtiers and schemers,Any book with castles and scheming court characters draws my attention - I feel as if I've been born in the wrong century.
5,The King's Pleasure,"Very fast moving, easy to read. Lots of action and love. Took me to another century and made me glad I'm a woman in this century."
5,Enjoyable Read,"This book was fun to read and the facts that the story brought out over the years were intriqing. Always fun to read about strong, tall, muscular, handsome Lairds and stubborn and obstinate heroines. Had an enjoyable ending."
2,The King's Pleasure,Badly written and long boring passages .Wat to much padding and very little actionNo way would I reccomend this book
2,Very long book,"It is a period novel and that's all it gets. Nothing interesting, nothing new. At certain point, the ""I do love him but I have to honor my mother wish"" gets boring and old. Ok, they have sex, lots of it. Ok, she is in love. Ok, he is in love. But that's all. Some fights here and there. And end of it. And I have to say this: it's so obvious which king her mother was talking about. Come on! Make something different. Never read any other book of Heather Graham, and I certainly won't. Boring stuff in a very, very long book."
4,Smells like Hickory Smoke to me...,Great Book! Built a Smokehouse and had to break it in. Tried the 'Canadian Bacon' recipe and will now never buy store bought again! I am just itching to try out more of the recipes. Have to get used to smelling like smoke....
4,Read and enjoy,I recently received Charcuterie as a Christmas gift from my daughter. I have been unable to put this book down since I opened the cover. It is written in an easy to understand and playful style. The information and recipes are well researched and applicable to trained cooks as well as those who are enthusiasts.
5,My son-in-law loves it.,"This was a Christmas present for my son-in-law. He is wanting to start making sausage, etc. and loves the cook book."
4,Charcuterie KING!,"Excellent book...but it REALLY needs some good photos and many more illustrations to go along with the text. Very text heavy book...and I kept wanting to see pictures of what the author was doing! Come Mr Publisher, don't be so cheap!!"
5,The first cookbook I read cover to cover,"The fact that I am taking the time to add my review to the others that already exist for this book should tell you how smitten I was by it. I have never before read an entire cookbook, but this one was so enticing and enjoyable that I could not put it down. In the 18 months I have owned it, I have made perhaps 1/5 of the recipes in the book, and have learned a great deal. My family and friends are amazed by what I can make. Diet and exercise have taken on new importance in my life. And I am having a great time. Buy this book, you will love it too.'Nuff said. Look at the other reviews if you want details."
4,2BQ'D,"I purchased this because I do competition BBQ and wanted additional information about sausage products. This is one product I have competed with and made my own from scratch. Many of the other competitors bought sausage, but I made mine and want a WOW factor, so doing research helps with different ideas. I have made several of the recipes, but the brine seems a bit salty, so next time I make the canadian bacon I will cut back on the salt content. Love the book, next going to look at French Laundry."
2,A better history book than a how-to on sausage making.,"This book has been hailed as the sausage making bible. So, I was hoping for a thorough description of how to naturally ferment a dry-cured sausage. Instead they mention how fermentation is a process used for really amazing sausages and then move on to recommend the use of a artificial flavor additive to simulate the fermentation process!! I was really very disappointed. Especially after reading chapter one, which is almost completely dedicated to convincing you that you should cultivate your skill in the use of ancient food preservation techniques for the sole purpose of producing superior flavor in your food! I don't get the rationale.There is nothing in this book that you cannot find on the internet. Don't bother buying it."
4,Charcuterie,"This book has become my bible for all meaty things preservable. It is easy to read, understand and follow instuctions."
4,"A love song to fat, salt and pigs","This is a great book, really laying bare the rather mysterious art of curing meat. The authors are immensely passionate about their topic, and it is refreshing to read a book unabashedly vaunting fat, salt and all the things everyone else runs screaming from. I'm about half way through so far, and have really been inspired. The only thing stopping me from 5 starring it is the illustrations, which although are well executed, I think would have been better served with regular photos (which I suspect the illustrations are just drawn from anyway). The recipes are easy, the information is concise and doesn't presume an already high level of culinary knowledge. If you are interested in curing your own meat (and vegetables, btw) or are just after an informative book on a little covered subject, then this comes highly recommended."
5,best book ever,"This is not a cookbook, the book has great stories as well as recipes but most of all it teaches you the craft of curing your own meats at home. Most of the techniques are done with equipment you already have at home or could easily attain. It's written in a way that makes it easy to read cover to cover as a novel."
5,Marvellous book!,"I have never borrowed a book from the library and loved it so much I had to buy it. That was the case with this book. Charcuterie is straight forward to the point and obviously written by a couple of guys that love this subject to the point where you can't help getting excited. Yes we are talkng about sausages and salting and curing stuff here! Boy do they like pork as well, any book with the line '..we'd like to make sure that one thing is understood here and now: The pig is king' is fine by me.The other thing that impressed me is the recipes are in metric. Finally some American authors that allow for the fact that the whole world is run in imperial measurements. Bravo. I'm off to make some sausages."
5,Great insight for a newbie!,This book by Ruhlman and Polcyn is fantastic! I'd never made my own meats before but after reading it and following the step by step directions I am confidently making my own sausage with venison! I've also used their Jerky recipe to great success. Admittedly I'm not much of a cook but this book has encouraged me to grow my skills and to prepare more and varied meats I'm looking forward to trying out their new book Salumi!
2,Too many mistakes!,"According to other reviewers there are some mistakes in this otherwise attractive book. I discovered a particularly glaring one on the cooking times given for confit of duck. The authors recommend an initial cooking time of six hours (and up to teh hours). Even six hours would result in a mess and is absurd. Jane Grigson (page 319) gives a time of about two and a half hours which works very well. It tends to suggest that the authors have not actually attempted their own recipe. This seems more probable than not to me, since I followed their timing for pork confit and it was clearly far too long - the meat shrank badly and had to be handled very carefully after the initial cooking to avoid it falling apart.If you like reading the book, fine. But do not rely on it for correct instructions."
5,Good read,Purchased this for my husband. He seems to be enjoying it and making plans on what to make first smoked ham or sausage.
2,traditionalists be warned,"I bought this book as I have embarked on a slow food adventure of my own - it is a book filled with great recipes for sausage, terrine, salami and all sorts of great sounding and mouthwatering meaty tidbits - however, and this is a big however, it suffers from stagefright. Why because it only delivers one verdict in the area of food safety - that nitrites and nitrates rule - it fails to give the educated consumer a choice in approach. I fail to see how, when amongst many others the acknowledged King of hams in Parma or its moot equal Iberico can deliver such gems without the use of nitrates,the art of charchuterie can be considered complete for dismissing their non use so quickly. Many will deservedly love this book but for the adventurous among us it falls short."
2,I agree with all the 2 STAR ratings and a little more,"I purchased the book before I read the negative reviews. I probably would have bought it anyway being sckeptical of reviews. I couldn't have said it better, esp. about the nitrates, and the non-existence of photos!!!!!!!!!!!, how do I know if what I made looks like it should? I will add in my review several other comments such as: the book appears to be written for the sake of avant garde chefs trying to impress one another (a tip-off to this is the forward by the chef of the French Laundry); the recipes are not necessarily traditional but manipulated to create a sense of excitement; if these guys really made these cured meats etc. where are the photos of the finished product?, there is no excuse for this today given the techno capabilities of the computer. The book will probably sit on my shelf for a long time before I reference it."
2,Constructive replies to others' opinions,"I liked the book, but do agree there are shortcomings (as consructively provided by another ""non-professional"" reviewer.) I will not however recommend the book, as I was quite disapointed with the author's ""blast"" dismissing less than ingratiating (?) reviews by attributing them to ""mean-spirited and inept reviewers."" Rather arrogant sir - I too prefer that cookbooks have as few errors in direction and presentation as possible. Pointing out ""room for improvement"" in a first edition is constructive - why would you think your prospective customers inputs any less credible than your editors?"
2,"Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing","Of the three recipes I tried, two were just mediocre and the third was a waste.The three were bacon, sauerkraut, and gravlox.The bacon burned before becoming crisp, the sauerkraut spoiled and had to be discarded, and the gravlox lost most of the raw salmon flavor even though it was the soft cure.With my personal method of making sauerkraut I only had 1 spoiled batch (3 quarts) in the 4 years of making the kraut."
1,poor,I bought this book because I thought it was going to teach me how to cure meat and store it. It has more condiment recipes and brines than it did cured italian meats. Save your money.
5,Awesome,"If you are interested in charcuterie this is a must have. Easy to read format is not like a textbook. The food comes alive in the pages and you want to make everything. All of the recipies that I have tried have worked marvelously, bacon, saurkraut, pate de campagna, pate en croute, chutneys, etc. I love it."
4,Charcuterie,"An excellent book, lots of good easy to follow recipes and history of various products. It makes me excited to get on with the process of making my own delicious meat products."
5,A Delicious Masterpiece,"My favorite book on Charcuterie. As a book, it is as beautiful as it is interesting and helpful. An awesome enticement for anyone to get into the art, and it is deliciously delivered with masterful photography and good writing to boot."
2,Yuck,"I suppose this product does replace electrolytes, but it tastes pretty raunchy. I'll just stick with water"
3,"very pretty, but complicated",this hummingbird is pretty and different. It does not come with clear directions and is a little complicated. Because of the design you can not hang it where there is any movement
3,Not Much of A Backpack,"I'd hesitate to call this a backpack, more of a stuffed animal with straps and a pocket small enough to maybe fit a few coins. Though given the target age for this, I'd be worried about small items that could actually fit inside of it. It is, however a very cute toy for children who like the show and Wags. Major complaint is the quality, however. Realized after the gift was opened that there was a relatively large tear in the seam of Wags' arm."
3,Nico is Adorable in La Dolce Vita !,"I watched this classic, but weird film from Federico Fellini, who is noteworthy for his twisted, distorted films I felt it was dull and in line with the rest of his films.Until happy little Nico (of the Velvet Underground)sparked up onto the screen with the happiness and youth of a sparrow. She is grand in her role. She's in the prime of her beauty and she just fits in with the whole nonsense of the film.Fellini cast her immediately although most of the footage was already shot, not about to bypass getting this young and giggling beauty into a piece of his puzzle. Talented eye of his !Unfortunately, her role is quite short in this lengthy movie."
4,when fellini became fellini & marcello became marcello,"from this point on, fellini stopped being a director and became an adjective. long and episodic, this movie takes on the paparazzo and celebrity symbiotic love/hate. now to some today that might seem pretty standard, but this WAS half a century back. i can imagine what audiences felt back then! and of course, this IS the movie that made marcello mastroianni into a household name, and for that alone it deserves its praise. fellini would go on to top it, but nothing he did after could have come about if not for this seminal motion picture."
3,Comparing 8/1-2 to La Dolce Vita,"Anyone who is comparing La Dolce Vita to 8 1/2 and saying it's better or on the same level should have their head examined.And no as J. A. Stankunas ""jonukwho"" put it this DVD isn't even close to the quality of the Criterion 8 1/2 DVD.People do yourself a favour and stop reading these amateur reviews, if you're not familiar with the film don't buy, rent first and judge for yourselves."
1,THE DVD CASE CAN BE USED AGAIN...,"I NEVER let boredom get in the way, and always watch a picture til its end. I had to take a nap in the middle of this one.It's one of the most unbearable, boring films I have EVER watch, and I've seen a few (10 in the last week). Lars Von Trier's ""Antichrist"" was pure fun and action in comparison!!!Once it was over, I saved the case and threw the movie away. There's not plenty of room in my house..."
5,2 Disc Collector's Edition,"One of the best films ever made, and essential for every collector. The extras -- interviews with Fellini, with Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni, are slight but entertaining. Beautifully digitally re-mastered, with an extra feature showing side-by-side comparisons of the original print with the remastered work. Endlessly watchable."
2,disappointed,"Maybe I was too young. I signed up for a course called ""Italian Cinema and Culture"" for the first term of my freshman year in college, thinking it sounded glorious. Ahh, to escape the immature boys of high school, go to college and learn about Italian culture and film! Big mistake. Huge. It was a little over a decade ago, but I vividly remember sitting in the lecture hall, and thinking, ""Are they kidding? A fish?"" The disappointment was very similar to my experience reading A Farewell to Arms, when I learned the difference between a Great Book and a book that would leave me impacted: I have to care. With both Hemingway and this movie, I just didn't."
2,A Film Thats Difficult To Enjoy,"Extensive roll of useless film is dull and I find it insignificant, unless you're a Fellini Fanatic.Otherwise it's a movie lacking in every aspect.Cannot recommend tis."
2,"A musty period piece, smelling bad","Only its undeniable status as one of central relics of the Sixites (one that has held up as well as, say, the Nehru jacket) saves this dull, pretentious, massively over-rated film from the lowest rating. Maybe you had to be there, but I wasn't, and, judging from this, I'm not sorry."
2,Not even close to his best. Better than L'Avventura,This film is a mess. It doesn't even come close to his other films. It has a few moments but the overall tone of this film is very simular to that of a fart. I hate to bash Fellini because I do love his films. I have heard people say he's overrated. I could never understand why someone would say such a thing. Now I know why. Because they watched La Docle Vita and never bothered to watch any of his earlier films.La Dolce Vita is an attempt at delivering the same message that Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura did. I also despise L'Avventura. Antonioni was the worst thing that ever happend to Italian Cinema. I understand that later on in his career Fellini admired Antonioni's films. I think La Dolce Vita was the result of Fellini's admiration for Antonioni. I really wish Fellini spent more time admiring Pier Paulo Pasolini. Pasolini's flims blew Antonioni's pretentious crap away.
2,La vita è troppo breve (Life is too short) to give 3 hours to this!,"Buyer Beware: despite other inexplicably glowing reviews, this movie is overly long, looks dated, seems ""choppy"" with different segments just strung together, and the ""plot"" borders on incoherent. Overall, it's bitter, not ""sweet."""
3,Misleading description,"Be aware that this is actually a CD titles ""La Dolce Vita - The Sweet Life and Italian Style Comedies"" and is not the full soundtrack to ""La Dolce Vita"" Only a single track is presents from the film."
3,So ... ?,"It lacks a plot. I almost fell asleep during the first half. It picked up during the 2nd half when the main character ran into his father. That was interesting for me, for personal reasons. But, having just watched it, all I can say is that it left me with an emtpy, hollow feeling. If that was the point, then the movie is quite successful. Mind you, I'm not the usual ""simplistic"" movie watcher. But that was my feeling..."
1,Three hours wasted,"I wasted three hours of my birthday watching this film, having read time and again what a masterpiece it was. Well, it isn't.How was I supposed to relate to any of the self-absorbed and superficial characters? If this is supposed to be a social polemic or some kind of lifestyle study, I'm damned if I could figure out what mattered in any scene. Jesus, I was so bored. When Anita Ekberg put the cat on her head near the Trevi fountain, I hoped that the feline would embed its claws in her peroxide. That might have injected some meaning into the filmDon't waste your time or money. This is utterly tedious tosh."
1,boring and very dated,"This 40 plus year old movie has collected alot of dust as its aged.It is very dated and a miserable bore by todays movie standards.Fellini tried to make something different and odd just for the sake of standing out . And today it does stand out, like a sore thumb.Ekberg is heavy and stout looking as even the image of beauty has changed so much since then.everything has changed so much since this film has been collecting dust."
2,BORING,"I had a hard time reading this book, I was just so bored I had to skip pages just to finish. There was no romance and to many lose ends, nothing worst than finishing a book and still have no idea what happen."
1,Last Breath is a last gasp,"Lee has plunged to a new low with her latest ""mystery"" Last Breath. The mystery is poorly developed, along with the plot, the love interest and most of the characters who appear in the book. While I don't mind suspending belief and accommodating an author who slowly develops the story line, I don't like leaving the story prematurely before all ends are tied up and the mysteries solved. This text lacks fire and excitement. The last gasp heard will be the reader expiring from boredom."
2,Just Missing Something,I'm not sure what was missing from this story. I've read many Rachel Lee books that I have truly enjoyed but I just could never get involved in this book. I never felt any connection between Chloe or Matt and there was no feeling of romance between them at all. I found the story hard to get into and found myself skipping pages just so I could finish it.
2,dont believe this is an original item,"purchased this at amazon as i trusted them that this would be an original item. however, it smells close to the same but 15 to 30 minutes after putting it on it no longer smells. The bottle i had previously same brand and name would last and last! i believe this is a knockoff. sold by amazon.comLLC. Buyer beware, best to stick with a local retailer for colognes i think. Apparently it is not returnable."
3,Minor Enhancements of 2006,"Little real improvements over 2006, however the biggest omission on day one is the absence of money for the pocket pc. I use this as my main entry point while away and now am worse off than before the upgrade."
1,No product received,I received an e-mail saying that this product was unavailable. My payment was refunded.
3,product is ok but cannot customize it,The only thing I didnt like is that they changed the budget setup. Its not very intuitive.
1,Not worth to buy,"I tried it for several monthes and had the following experience:1) this is not user friendly. I used many software programs. This is the worst. It seems to be for IT users only.2. It has a lot gadgets but not very practical.3. It downloaded wrong info from my credit card.4. MS technical support is friendly and fast response But usually it doesn't help to solve problem.5 In summary, I rather try the othe company software for our company finance."
3,Better than Quicken,"I think that this one was better than the Quicken equivalent I was using but the automatic updates are no better. I have had to fix accounts about every other time I update. It seems to be working ok now but the updates stil take about as long as it takes for me to login to all my accounts and look at them manually so I am not impressed with this aspect.The reporting, on the other hand, is awesome and that is what really saves me time.The invoicing isn't adequate and I stil create my own invoices but I do use Money reports to build theinvoice and then jsut copy/paste as needed."
1,Book of Drawings,"This book merely showed drawings of things you could buy plans to build. Among the things you can't build with this book is a huge castle. Who on earth would buy a book to build backyard castle? I bought this book expecting several plans for building tool/garden sheds. What I got was some ideas on what a shed could look like. I get more insight every time I look out my kitchen window at my neighbors' sheds. I am not even going to try to resell this book, because I wouldn't do that to anyone."
5,Super Smooth Amazonian Energy Power Booster,What I say to the previous reviewer to clear up any confusion is that I did not start using this product an appetite suppressant - rather as an energy booster. I use three as a dose immediately before I workout or surf and I find them to be very effective and far smoother than the current crop of caffeine laden diet pills or caffeine/ma huang combo type pills. They are particularly good in combination with cordyceps - either MRM or Paradise Herbs Himalayan Cordyceps which I find to be the best bang for the buck available. Paradise Herbs is a first rate company with highly conscious production practices - top of the line.
1,Paradise herbs cha de bugre,"This is one of the worst products I have tried!!!! WHAT a waste of MONEY! Doesn't take your appitite away AT ALL,"
3,As expected,"As soon as my son began playing with these, one of the foam covers flew off. We glued it back on with gorilla glue, and I suspect we'll have to do the same for the other side soon enough. Forunately, we didn't pay much for them. I would say we may have paid more than they're worth, though. I gave them 3 stars simply because my son is enjoying them in spite of how cheaply made they are."
1,Junk - ZERO Stars,"ZERO Stars, but I wasn't allowed to select that! This toy is a piece of junk. It fell apart as soon as my son started swinging it around....and isn't that what it's made to do? The foam flew right off. We even tried to crazy-glue it but couldn't get it to stay together. Guess the materials (the plastic inside tube and the outside foam) aren't made to be held together. Waste of money and my son couldn't use it for his Halloween Ninja costume. The company that sent it, however, was very timely. No issues with them."
4,"Neat book, size and great maps","Very neat historical atlas. Excellent maps and interesting pictures on the sides. Civilizations are dealt with in brief 2-page summaries. This book obviously only intends to be an introduction to larger studies by other authors, and it accomplishes its objective well enough.The reader will surely feel inclined to further his or her research into one of the many early civilizations discussed here.Broad in scope, limited in depth, but pays off with the illustrations. A little setback, though, is its inclination to pay service to political correctness is -unfortunately- present in the text.I would have preferred a little more text-space on European and Near Eastern civilizations and less on the Asian ones, too foreign to my cares (should I be sorry for being honest? I don't think so)."
4,True Black Metal - by jerks?,"Here you have the real thing - Black Metal without the frills. The guitar work is relentless. There is enough variation from song to song to avoid monotony. The snare could sound better, and the drumming is basic; these guys aren't virtuosos. The voice is tortured, of course. Sadly, they also fall in line with other intolerant bands, tho the lyrics are just 'all Satan, all the time'. (see the book Lords of Chaos for the lowdown). Nice instro soundscape at the start too. Is it wrong to like these guys? - you'll have to decide for yourself."
3,darkthrone a kingdom lost?,"BAD? no really, fickle maybe is the word, the inconstancy of the past albums is easily perturbed; the duo nocturnoculto-fenriz to need a refresh breath ( maybe a time of repose)I dont now certainly?.however darkthrone is a legendary band in the circle of norwegian black metal and sardonic wrath belong that legacy......"
3,"well, it's darkthrone","it's no big secret that somewhere in darkthrone's career they started putting out some pretty redundant albums, but this is at least a fun sort of redundant that suggests a sincere love for thrash metal and d-beat/crusk punk. it's notable for being the only recent darkthrone album to be derivative of the band's influences in attempt to create something new without the slightest sense of of irony, rather than simply cannibalizing the past for the sake of it and adding joke lyrics. a bit monochromatic and certainly not a sjakk matt, but i like it; just listen to their essential releases first for context."
5,killer riffage and drumming,darkthrone seem to let loose on this release and just rot and roll extrmely heavy riffs and pounding drums with and attitude that dont give two flying [...].
5,great album from these Black Metal giants,"Another great album, unrelenting, heavy, great lyrics, great product. Get this now!"
3,It's alright for later Darkthrone,"Pretty routine stuff now for Darkthrone. It's not bad, but far from good. Has some nice riffs, and fenriz is always good with his drumming.Not as powerful a listen as their earlier albums. If you can find this used for $8 or below, i'd say go for it."
5,The best since Panzerfaust,"I don't know what it is but I keep comming back to this album. Its lo-fi or necro (as are all Darkthrone releases) but has a very real and powerfully visceral punch to it. Darkthrone have their sound down by now and most of the albums since Panzerfaust have followed the same formula. And this time the formula really works. Several of the songs are a wall of blast beat spiked harmonic power, others are comprised of pummeling, almost grooving Celtic Frost-like riffs. My only complaint is that the vocals are a bit low in the mix. But overall I find this to be a very satisfying album."
4,A must buy for pit bull fans,This book is a must buy for anyone interested in pit bull terriers.It contains a lot of information about the history of dogs in great detail.
2,Islam is a poor source,"I believe that the author's knowledge of Islam is greatly lacking, for his citing of Islam as a source for the sayings of Jesus supports my criticism of him.The religion of Islam and its scripture contain nothing of any historical value. I know what I'm talking about, beause I have disected it to pieces and found nothing, even from the Quran, except crude plagiarism and tedious and ridiculous repetitions of historical accounts taken from the Bible and retold in twisted and distorted versions with full of errors. I know I have stepped on some toes, but the truth must be told.The Lost Sayings of Jesus: Teachings from Ancient Christian, Jewish, Gnostic And Islamic Sources--Annotated & Explained (SkyLight Illuminations)"
5,Great Fun!!,I love this CD! We were lucky enough to see a production of The Last Starfighter the musical at the New York Musical Festival last year. The show was delightful and we were so glad to have the CD to sing along with after we got home. I highly recommend both the CD and the show!
4,Therapy ball,"We ordered the ball for our 5 year old who needs physical therapy for right sided weakness following a brain tumor. She and her brother and sister are all motivated to use the ball, and it's strong enough to stand up to that pressure. It does have a series of dents around a section of it that I'm not sure are supposed to be there, and it took a month to arrive. But the ball is doing the job!"
2,Not There Best.....,"I LOVE Pretty Boy Floyd........That Being Said.....If You Are Just Discovering Pretty Boy Floyd, Start With ""Leather Boyz With Electric Toyz"" Or ""Porn Stars"". Although An Okay CD, This In Nowhere Close To Their Best."
4,Ambitious book that mostly succeeds,"I'm not so interested in the debate about whether or not there's an error in the Special Relativity thought experiment on page 5. I came to this book to try and finally get some grasp on the maths of General Relativity (and I have looked, long and hard) and for that I have found there is no other book that approaches what this book can do for the layman.Yes, I can criticise it for its flaws - there are critical reviews on here that already do that well. My own main criticism would be that it went into too much detail, or had too much repetition, and I felt it could have got the same essential messages across in half the length (or less).Would I recommend it? Most definitely!"
5,best book on the subject,"I am a ""motivated and attentive reader"", trying to appreciate the meaning of relativity for so many years, with frustrating results. And yes, I'm full of books explaining relativity,from popular to technical texts, never reaching the goal. This is the book I was looking for, a book anyone can understand, a step by step guide to the mind of the Master."
1,A real disappointment,"I teach relativity to roughly the same audience that Jagerman istrying to reach, and I would NOT want my students near this book. Itis full of conceptual errors; the whopper on page 5 is just thebeginning. As another reviewer says of page 5, ""the end result iscorrect but the reasoning is incorrect."" I would add that the type offaulty reasoning employed there will get students very much on thewrong track from the very beginning; I don't see how they can build further understanding on this flawed foundation.)Jagerman has his heart in the right place. I've been trying to findbooks which bridge the gap between overly conceptual books for massconsumption on the one hand, and books for upper-division physicsmajors on the other hand. So when I read Jagerman's statement aboutwhy he wrote the book, I ordered it immediately. But it is a realdisappointment."
5,The Voices are the best,"Since it's release almost two years ago, A Day Like This has grown and grown on me. At first I was not grabbed. Then, one by one, the songs just emerged as gems in the light. Darmon's arrangements are the very best anywhere. No one can touch his Beethoven-esque sense of dramatic form which is achieved through melodic unfolding, contrast in timber, volume and pacing, and his ability to write four part harmony which flows as it were being improvised.The Voices have taken an art form rich with potential and caused it to blossom into an unprecedented artistic statement. Take time to hear what this foursome is saying. They are the best."
2,"""WAS"" the most exciting vocal group ever?","THE NEW YORK VOICES... a vocal ensemble which, at the top of their gamecould melt water or freeze it dead in its tracks! I sincerely hope thatthe 30-second samples (much too truncated for such a group --who doesone complain to?) leave out the best segments of their songs.But, if not, then it seems that they have more than lost their edge...they sound like the Lennon Sisters on Prozac. NYV fans have had morethan enough musical disappointments in the last few years. We shouldnot have to endure a fall from grace by the New York Voices as well!"
3,"Nice print, but be aware...","The print is 8x8 as described, but be aware that there is a one-inch margin all the way around, so the actual picture is only 6x6. I was not expecting this white border and am disappointed by it. However, the print is nice, and I suppose it will do."
5,Very Good.,"Nueva Flamenco in the Latin Jungle. Way cool. My first Strunz & Farah CD. Not my last, if they're all this good."
4,Extremely helpful guidelines on buying toys,"Whether you have concerns about your child's language development or not, this book is very helpful. It speaks about toys intelligently and analyzes what can be taught with different toys and how. It also includes a good amount of concrete information of language development."
5,Great book,A phenomenal book to help parents with special needs develop a meaningful playtime at home.
1,Review of Volare -Greatest Hits - Domenico Modugno,"Some great songs, including the title song Volare, were ruined by atrocious editing. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this one."
3,three complaints equals 3 stars,"I only have three complaints but other than that it would have been a perfect buy.1) its came witha small pinky nail sized chip in paint.2) It comes with 6 screws and 4 of them too short= doesnt work, i had to use the original from the frame.3) it doesnt fit my 2010 nissan xterra frame. its too wide. I had to pound it on the ground for a slight bend in the mounting ends of the hitch and now it fits.if the screws fit i would be happy.if there was not chip in the paint i would be happy.it fits i am happy and it looks great im happy.. but it would have had a 5 star is there was not chip in the paint and the screws fit.. i dont mind the hammering to make it fit snug...I dont want to go through the hassel of sending it back and waiting for a another ans spending another 3 house getting it to fit properly."
4,nice hitch but it didn't fit quite right.,"I installed this hitch myself. After dropping the spare and the exhaust system, the hitch still still didn't slide into place like I thought it would. I could only get five of the six bolts in it. At first I thought maybe the vehicle had been hit from the rear (it was a recent purchase), but I double checked the carfax and it had a clean report. I had to use a 5 lb sledge hammer to get it in place. After all that though, I do like the way it comes out from underneath, it does not interfere with the workings of the spare and the exhaust goes by it like it was a stock installation. I like the step plate welded on top. That is a really nice touch. For the price, I am not arguing about having to ""influence"" it into place."
5,"super duper--great company, easy to install.","Wonderful ---this was ordered as a used part. It appeared to be brand new. Very impressive. Great company, fast delivery."
5,Great Product,"This product reeks of quality with good looking welds and a nice powder coating. Installation was easy as the fit was good and there there were good instructions. You'll probably have to drop the tail end of the tail pipe to make installation easier, but that is easy."
4,Curt hitch,Does the trick. Seems very sturdy. A little rough to install with one person but a lift would make it a lot easier.
5,A peptalk for those who hesitate to try new try new things.,"PBS viewers may recognize Frances Weaver from her ""Midlife Musings"" segments. A middle-aged widow, she encourages her contemporaries to go out and enjoy the world. This slender volume speaks to those who dream of exploring far-off (and not so far-off) places, but who lack confidence in their skills for coping with life away from home and familiar surroundings. With specific advice (start by exploring your own hometown) Weaver affirms that the real purpose of travel is to expand your horizons. This book would make a pleasant gift for a person newly widowed, divorced, or empty nester. Reader beware! This book motivated me to take a spur of the moment bargain excursion to London."
4,Delaware Vocabulary,"This is a modern reprint of Ebenezer Denny's 1860 vocabulary of the Delaware Indian language (Lenape). It is a very small volume, and there is no phonetic key. An interesting book from a historical linguistics persepective or if you'd like to learn a few words of Delaware, but don't buy it expecting to learn how to speak the language. The book includes historical background and the author's original letters."
1,Jim's Bias Review,I haven't had a chance to try any of the recipes but I have read through the book and found it to be easy to understand. Tracy puts cooking into words that anyone can follow and cook some delicious meals!
3,Expectations out of line?,"Maybe I was expecting too much based on the reviews, but even the instruction manual says you can put a lot more in this blender at once than in regular blenders. Well you can NOT purée 3-4 cups of cooked sweet potatoes in there (for baby food)at once. You have to stick a spoon in there to push down the bits that stick to the sides up top. In addition, the thing is loud like a jet engine on medium and high speeds!! That said, it sure does make snow out of ice."
4,Kitchenaid Blender,I bought this blender after going through four others. I don't think I will ever find one that doesn't drip when you pour. However this is the best blender of them all. It blends ice wonderfully.
4,great blender,"What a nice improvement over the antique blender I had been using. Good power, easy, simple operation, and I thus far really like the all in one clean-up (We'll see what happens w/ a particularly gooey concoction when it comes to cleaning around the blades). I would have prefered to test a cheaper model next to this prior to purchasing but I'm certainly not unhappy w/ the cost/quality ratio of the product."
2,WWII,The quality of the production is very poor. The sound is muffled and most of the video is not really clear enough to see what is going on.
4,History reviewed,Great value for very little cost. I remember watching some of these as a kid and now enjoy them even more as they are a wonderful historical documentary of WWII at sea. I look forward to watching all the episodes and then passing on the set to my kids.
2,victory at sea collectors tin,"I received the dvd quickly,it was a christmas present for my husband. Unfortunately it is defective.The tape played at first but the second half no sound is coming out. I play dvd's all the time so its not my player. I would hope to get my money back or a new one mailed to me. Thanks, Gina"
3,Victory At Sea,"I have not seen Victory At Sea since it first appeared on television back in the 1950's. I had not remembered the breath, scope, and detail in the film footage. The battle scenes are truly astonishing. Watching it again after all these years, however, I found that the Richard Rogers music, as fine as it is, suffers after repeated hearing in every episode. A more serious flaw in the original is the intonation and voice-over of the narrator whose commentary is ponderous, overly melodramatic, and, at times, downright tiresome. The sound quality, as I expected, is poor by today's standards. With all it faults, though, I strongly recommend this film to all who are too young to have lived through the time of that terrible war so that they may better understand and honor the energy, bravery, and sacrifice of so very many of our fighting men and women and those who backed them with all their will and might on the home front so that we would prevail."
5,Victory at Sea-DVD,"Well familiar with the series. Also own on VHS. This DVD played in a 1080p upconverting DVD player looks very clean and crisp relative to the VHS copy. Viewers should maintain proper perspective when assessing the video quality in that the vast majority of the source films were produced during the late 1930s and early 1940s by combat camera personnel from various military organizations worldwide. Considering that fact, this DVD is excellent. Regarding the content of the program, the DVD includes all original episodes from the VAS series; without editing. A worthy addition to the video library of any WWII or Naval Warfare history buff."
4,Get Mill Creek,"I'd like to thank all those who said to avoid the History Channel version and go for Mill Creek. I'll probably never know if History Channel is as bad on sound as they say, but I do know Mill Creek gives what I want - the experience they had sitting at home in the 50s. Fancy extras and commentaries not required. The documentary itself is as good as everyone says."
5,A Great One To Have in the Collection,"This is a great DVD in all respects. Without a doubt, it's one of the best WW II documentaries ever produced. I first saw it on TV in the 50's when I was a very young boy. It's just as great today as it was then. The narration by Leonard Graves is probably the best narration ever for ANY film."
3,OK for wheels and light duty,This impact wrench is OK but nothing special. It works for lug nuts on wheels that aren't tourqued above 90 Ft lbs but nothing more than that. Definitely light duty at best but works good.
2,Not as strong as I needed.,"I have an older Campbell that seems to work much better. This one eliminates a lot of air and my 20 Gal compressor has a hard time keeping up with extended use. The power rating may be off, because I find that I still have a long way to go to tighten lugs to spec even using this at full pressure."
5,It was a wonderful story of triumph and tragedy.,"I had to read this book to do a paper, but got so engrossed in it that I read it within a day! It was an absolutely wonderful story of determination, beating the odds, and a beautiful friendship. It made me feel like I knew Hank and Bo personally."
2,so so kickboard,"This kickboard is too big for the typical swim/gym bag and also seem to have a lot of drag in the water. I ended up trimming my board but the drag is definitely noticeable. At least it floats, I bought another kickboard before this and it ended being a throway because it was too light and couldn't hold me up in a streamline position."
1,Graviola 600mg,Worst shipping ever !! I waited so long for this product that I had forgotten what I ordered !!!
4,nice,"Well, I like this toy. My son, on the other hand, who is almost 5, never plays with it. I bought it for the skateboard included; you can only buy the set and he had played with the skateboard at a shop that didn't sell them yet. Ordered it here; he played with it a bit and then lost interest. Doesn't even pick it up. I think if you have a less active child, perhaps it's a good choice. Good quality, though. Very cute. I like it more than he does."
4,"Great quality, wish they included a rocking horse","I absolutely love the concept of toys for the dollhouse kids. The quality and finishing of this set is superb. The wheels of the skateboard, cycle and hobbyhorse roll nicely. The teddy is too big for the cradle. You can think of it as a large teddy for the doll. I don't find the mini dollhouse or cradle particularly interesting, nor does my daughter.The easel is fab. It gives a very nice look to our dollhouse kid's room. I wish they had a rocking horse in the set, because that is one thing that your kids can easily make their dolls enjoy. Making the dolls skate or even ride the hobby horse is tricky."
4,A Good and Broad Compendium,"I mentioned in my book as to how heroic the ""white boys"" of the press were, and how they helped in the civil rights fights, now long ago. On a couple of occassions, you were in more danger than you realized.Thank you for giving good research and a good reading to Emory O. Jackson, of the BIRMINGHAM WORLD newspaper. Emory was a ""civil rights fighter"" down in Hell, long before M.L.King and many others came along.Those who chose to read, will see that history was more than King having a dream in Washington, with his arm in the air!"
5,Life sustaining knowledge,"I take issue with the other reviewer who rated all NiHuaChing's books (and Master Ni) negatively. Let this person share his wondrous credentials. The person obviously has a personal grudge and I would be very careful and read at least one of NiHuaChing's books in order to properly JUDGE FOR YOURSELF. I met NiHuaChing several times in the late 70's, knew some of his students, and found Master Ni to be sincere in his desire to share knowledge which has been passed down from antiquity. His students learn everything from tai chi tailored to the seasons to herbology and Chinese medicine. In my opinion, Master Ni's books can be helful by themselves, or as supplements to your own studies and classes. He speaks plainly and never condescends. I have read several of his books and have found them to be quite steady and on the mark."
2,Needs editing,This book has incorrect information and editing errors throughout. The publisher needs to review this text.
4,Does the job and in great condition,"I got the book in time and it was in great condition. It has done the job, but that's because it was required for the class. I almost always purchase books through amazon.com"
2,Good for extended short rides,"I was expecting this to really work, it does for short extended rides, but after being on a ride for over and hourit really did not improve the soreness I normally experienced on these types of rides. I also tried another productcalled the Booty Seat and that too did not help. These products may work for others but it did not work for me.My husband ultimately had to purchase a Mustang seat for the motorcycle and that did the trick. I did returnthis item and experienced no problems doing so and my account was credited as soon as they received theirproduct back, no hassles at all with the seller they were very understanding."
4,Great Pickup,I had a friend of mine install this in my Taylor guitar. It helps the natural sound of a great sounding guitar come out to the electronic world. It has great overall tone.
5,Best installation instructions I have seen from any company!,"Got to admit I was a little intimidated by the installation process when I was shopping for this pickup. But when I got the box I was pleasantly suprised to find excellent instructions (not too long, not too short) along with plenty of supplies to complete the instillation properly. The jig method is super easy and provided great results. I was really excited to try out the pickup so I plugged it into my Roland AC-33 and let her rip, it was awsome, very full and very representative of my guitars sound. K&K you have a convert in me. I am now thinking about trying this on my Martin!"
5,Awesome sound,"Installed this myself on my martin HD28v. Surprisingly simple install thanks to the great instructions that ship with this pickup. the sound is amazing. No battery required, or loose cables hanging out in your guitar ...very clean and crisp acoustic sound and hand/tap response. If you want your guitar to sound exactly the way it does unplugged, then get this tuner ...you wont be disappointed."
5,very essential,this is a great compilation of The Jackson 5's material.i have alot of there Greatest hits&Albums but rarely has there been something as complete as this.the Anthology that i have on Album came out many many years ago.uncut original recordings.it's very a soulful collection.this is a must have set for folks that dig The J-5.
1,This is way too high of a price,This price is highway robbery. I bought two of these last week for $14.00 a piece at a local Menards.They are also advertised online for $22-25 in several places.
2,Big Hoopla - Disappointing Read,"I purchased this book after reading the rave reviews and believing it, given the name, would teach me something a bit more complex than ""the golden rule."" Equally as disappointing was the way it was written. The style and word usage is around the third grade level and the content around the fifth. Also, if you have ever in your life read any other book remotely associated with this subject, don't waste your money. This is simply the most basic content, rehashed in a cutesy little story that is less than believable and not very interesting."
5,Simple Story With a Powerful Message,"Greg Reid's book is the simple story of a millionaire mentor named Roy as he builds a lifetime relationship with a young boy named Oscar. The story is simple, but the lessons are profound. They convey the simple steps necessary to achieve success in all areas of your life. It's not just a book about becoming financially rich, but about becoming rich in your relationships with others. It's also about using your success to give others a helping hand up. This book came at a crucial turning point in my life and I can say that The Millionaire Mentor gave me a lot of inspiration at a low point in my own career, direction to focus on my new plan of action, and a vision to help others along the way. Thank you Greg Reid for writing this extraordinary, simple, inspiring book!"
3,Scifi Comedy,"First off, this is a comedy. Low budget (very simple sets), more along the lines of ""Office"" meets ""Red Dwarf"". There are a few good jokes in it. Think of a business office on mars, where everyone seems to be some kind of manager exec, and all they do is give orders, but none of them has any idea what's really going on. People are dying and the managers are only worried about the paperwork and the companies reputation.There are a couple of quick shots of upper nudity on women, and some profanity. There are a few shots of (unrealistic) blood and gore. I don't want to give too much away story wise. I doubt you would watch this more than once, so rent it on a slow night. It is what it is."
2,shipping charges are way out of line,"product arrived ok but the shipping charges were for each ""one"" of the items, which were shipped as one unit, and were much higher than the items themselves"
4,finger pull door edge router bit,The router bit worked very well on my oak cabinet doors. The finger pull shape on the edge of my doors very closely resembles the original cupboard doors that came with our home.
5,The Father of Pace,Ray Taulbot is the father of pace handicapping. His idea's and angles were concieved when little or no information was out there for handicappers. Most computer programs to this day came from Taulbot's idea's and teachings.
1,no cd includd - false advertising,This was supposed to be the music book AND the cd so we could hear the songs and learn to sing them properly in Italian. We also needed the cd for an audition. How frustrating to buy something you NEED and not receive it only to then have to scramble around and figure out a plan B...vendor needs to get his descriptions checked and corrected...as for the arias themselves - they of course are beautiful:-)
4,Great so far,"This was easy to install and has been holding up for the last month very well. We live really close to salt water, so we'll see how long the stainless holds out, but so far so good."
4,A Fire-Eater Remembers: The Confederate Memoir of Robert Bar,"I found Rhett's writings to be ironically similar in style to those of his nemesis, Jefferson Davis: rigid, self-righteous, and self-important. This book does, however, provide valuable insights into workings of the mind of a radical secessionist. The modern reader will frequently take issue with Rhett's ideas, but seeing how Rhett thought is useful in itself. William C. Davis does his usual excellent job of illuminating the text with insightful endnotes. The only flaw I found in the book is that the endnotes probably should be footnotes because they are so helpful in understanding Rhett's writings as well as Rhett's historical context. Leaving the notes in the back makes them less convenient and useful to the reader. Overall, I recommend this to the student of the secession crisis."
3,Mislead by Its Sub Tittle & Cover,"I guess, I'm a bit dissapointed w/ the book as I got mislead by its cover and sub tittle ""Using Period Finishes in Today's Home"". I thought I would find samples of classic interior design which applied in ""today's home = non stately home"", but the fact was - most of the pictures shown models of classic interior in the grand estate houses. I was hoping to get samples on how we can decorate our ""non manor"" home w/ classic interior objects. Also, lots of pictures are repetition from her other books and some are dated.Unless you have that kind of mansion, then this book might please you. Otherwise it might only perfect as a coffee table book - not for someone who is looking for inspiration for their ""regular/non stately"" home. Perhaps, it would be great for someone who wants to learn on interior details in some periods of era.For my next time purchase - maybe I should buy a book with some reviews on it?."
2,Dont Waste Your Money,"This Book Isnt Very Good Althought The Pictures Are Beautifuly Taken They Only Apply To Mansions, The Furniture Is All Antique (being AN Antique Collector it looked very tacky). Check It Out Of The Library Dont Waste Your MOney"
1,Wrong Item sent and no reply from company to fix error,"I ordered yeast-gard from Women's Health Formulas/Lake Consumer Products. The pictured product is the pink version of the product and is what I wanted. What I received is the green version of the product which is a different formulation and something that I can't use. When I emailed the company the only response I received was the automatic yes we've received your email and will get back to you. I never heard back. I emailed again and never heard back. I will not order again from this company as I am not sure they'll send me what they advertised and if there is an error, I feel I'll be stuck with paying for a product I didn't want or order. And I feel the company doesn't care about customer satisfaction."
1,Not a book download - only a short review,"thought this was a book download - instead it's only an review from a journal - my mistake, definitely not worth $5."
5,We love the Cleaver's!,"My family just loves the older television shows, back when there was such a thing as morals and good clean humor. Great family show! I recommend it highly."
5,Love the Beaver show,How can you not like the Beaver show? This is a great DVD to have. No commercial interruptions and you can watch them as many times as you want. Excellent quality even though they are in black and white.
5,In memoriam-Barbara Billingsley: 1915-2010,"It is my sad duty to announce to all 'Leave it to Beaver' fans that Barbara Billingsley, who will forever and ever be remembered as June Evelyn Bronson Cleaver, the matriarch of the family, passed away recently.So, when you view your 'Leave it to Beaver' DVDs, please reflect on the motherly advice she gave her sons, Wallace and Theodore, better known as The Beaver.R.I.P., Miss Billingsley, R.I.P. June Evelyn Bronson Cleaver."
1,Disgusted,"I have no idea why everyone is rating this as a 5. Yes, I love ""Leave ItTo Beaver"", and I would love to have every season. But the bottom line isthat the studio will not continue to release it on DVD (and believe me, Iwould buy every season in a heartbeat [I already own Seasons 1 and 2, which are the only ones released]). A previous review stated that there should be a statement for the release of Season 3 in September - October; well, it's nearly November and I haven't seen anything yet. Please everyone, contact Universal studios and demand that they release at least Seasons 3 and 4 (Season 4 includes one of my favorites -- the Soup episode)!!! Please do not give me a negative review on this; I just wisheveryone would get Universal Studios to get their act in gear!!!"
5,GREAT SHOW AND GREAT JOB BY SHOUT FACTORY!!!,"REALLY gREAT SHOW!!! Have been waitng years for the rest of this series to finally be released.these SHOUT FACTORY sDVDS are a LOT better than the original two seasons that were realeased by whatever Studio owns LEAVE IT IT BEAVER.i will be replacing my first two seasons with a high quality SHOUT FACTORY DVDS as soon as the firt two seasons become availble ).I hope SHOUT FACTORY will keep up the GREAT WORK and continue to release great old shows on DVD......A SIDE NOTE,I PERSNALYY UNDERSTAND WHY THESE HAVE THESE COMPANYS HAVE TO SOMETIMES CHARGE A LITTLE MORE AND SOMETIMES A LOT MORE TO PUT OUT SOME OF THESE OLD TV SHOWS ON DVD,THEY HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY REMASTERED AND CLEANNED UP AND THE AUDIENCE IS NOT AS LARGE AS big.NEWER SHOWS MADE IN THE LAST 10-15 years need a lot less actual work to transfer them to DVD"
3,Confused,"I own seasons 1 & 2 of Beaver on DVD, but didn't think the quality of those DVD's were up to par. On the other hand, I also own Shout's Paper Chase Season's 1&2 and they was excellent. I know there are more seasons of Paper Chase, but I don't know if Shout has them. I think some of the later ones were originally shown on PBS and then picked up by some other broadcast.If Live it to Beaver is coming out on Shout, I think I'd trust them to give me a good DVD. I'll wait and see. Certainly , The Andy Griffith Show was released individually and I can't criticize it at all. It was perfect. I think they were all around at the same time. I don't know who released it, but I don't think the later versions in color were released by the same studio as the first five. But they're all fine. All 8."
5,a must have to find gold.,"This book is the most important item you must have,even before you buy the gold pan and the shovel. there is more information,and details where to start to look for gold, than anything that I have ever imagined I could find."
5,Fascinating Window into History,"Written by the newspapers and miners of the time period, the stories and history provided in this book provides a unique and interesting window through time. If you enjoy the Old West, California history, or the history of the Gold Rush, this book is for you."
2,Too Dry,The book read like a textbook and was not very entertaining. I live in Northern California and really enjoy reading about the gold rush era. This book did not do it for me.
4,Nice baby pool.,"Look at the dimensions before you purchase this, because it is indeed a baby pool. Very small. How small? Each ring can be blown up with about 4 good breaths. That being said, this is exactly what I was looking for. We haven't put water in this, but have been using it as a ball pit. Nice compact size is easy for my 3 year old to drag around the living room. The kids have enjoyed playing with this and it seems to be holding up well. Would recommend if you are looking for a VERY SMALL pool. Would be perfect for an infant to sit in as a pool."
4,"Great pool, with and without water","We bought this pool for our 10-month old son, who loves the water. We're happy with the pool for the following reasons:1. Good size. It takes 18 gallons of water to fill it, but we typically only use about 6. It's plenty deep for cooling off and splashing. One we'd originally bought at Target took 78 gallons of water! We returned that when we found this on Amazon.2. Easy to inflate and deflate. Few breaths required.3. Great inside the house, even without water. Our son loves to sit in it and throw balls and other toys around. The edges of the pool keep them from rolling away. He can climb into and our of it.One small negative:1. The plastic is pretty thin. Our son has eight teeth and has managed to bite two holes in the top ring. The good news is the holes were easily fixed with clear packing tape.For the money, it was a great purchase."
5,Love it!,"This is a great little pool. We use it as a ""ball pit"" (filled up with plastic balls). I like that the bottom is inflatable to give it a little padding for my baby's tush! I also like the size. Not too big, not too little."
2,Dissapointed,"If you have an active toddler this might not be the toy for you.Within hours of blowing up the pool and my daughter climbing in and out of it - the top ring of the pool had a hole in and began to deflate.Luckily, the two remaining rings remained in tact... until today. The second ring just sprung a leak rendering the pool unusable.We have had the pool for about a week now and it's headed to the trash."
2,Top tier leaked.,We bought this for a ball pit and the top tier leaked air after the first day (it hadn't been used yet either). I won't be buying this again.
5,Awesome pool for infants,"I got this as a splash pool for my infant daughter and we used this pool all summer. It has held up great and I think it ended up being a really great pool for the price (~$7). It seems to hold air pretty well and it does include a crude patch kit in the event of a puncture. The most important feature is that it has a padded inflatable bottom which kept my baby from hitting her head on the ground beneath when she slipped or fell over. The description says 34"" diameter and it's a great size for children under 2. We intent to use it as a ball pit once the swimming season ends. The one thing I do not like is that the rings are sealed together such that exposed edges are on the inside of the pool, trapping water and debris between the rings and making it harder to clean."
5,Great pool for baby.,"Been using this pool for about 2 months. Only had to air it up the first time, has held air perfectly since. Our 14 month old loves it. It is also easy to clean and empty and refill with a bucket in the sink. Even if I had to buy one a year, it would still be worth it. I would buy it again."
4,Little but useful baby pool.,This is a small but perfect baby pool for my 9 month old. When it is 100 degrees outside and the AC indoors can not keep up my daughter loves playing in this. You do have to watch as the sides are not extremely sturdy but I wasn't expecting them to be being the size of the pool.
4,Great product,"I bought this for a friend who had a toddler. This pool has served so many purposes and it is very durable. My friend has put it in the yard where her daughter plays and plays. Her daddy complains that she loves it so much, she doesn't even notice when he comes home. She has also taken it to the beach (Zanzibar) and filled it with water and her daughter just plays and plays it there. She has taken it side of Kilimanjaro, set it up and filled it with water there and her daughter just plays and plays. She and another toddler friend leap into it and out, splash each other to their hearts content. It seems very safe and has lasted two years now. Guess that is pretty good when it gets a hard workout all year long."
2,Leaked with first use,"The first time we used it, the top ring sprung a leak. I'm not sure how this happened as it was the top ring and our toddler didn't have any sharp objects. We were on the level grass and it was only 1/2 way full of water.It was still usable - though the top ring would be deflated and floppy. We didn't fill the water that high anyways.The 3rd time we used it, it was at campsite and our toddler fell down on her butt and I guess that started a slow leak in the base.I liked this because it was padded on the bottom, but it's worth about $5 because you only get a few uses out of it.I'll be looking for a different brand next summer."
5,A love story,Bandy is a wonderfully engaging book about the bond between Marcia and Bandy. Anyone who loves animals will relate to this story of love and the desire to care for a creature that needs our assistance. Bandy responds to Marcia's love by returning time and again to let her know he is okay.
5,Yeah Man!,"John and Louie, Ha! Haaah! I love it! Making no apologies for loving Jesus and knowing how to ROCK! Love the harder sound post-Petra. Keep bringin' it on!"
5,truly helpful,"This book will help teachers, parents, and even coaches develop their kids to become more adept at the rigors of physical education. This book is clear, concise, easy to understand, AND easy to put into your lesson plans! Trying hard to help your kids become more coordinated? Pick up this book."
5,Week by week guide. Easy to prep.,"I have used this book for years. 36 weeks of week by week instruction. Pretest in the back. Also, has a description of how to build/make simple equipment - for under $100 total! Use it for teacher training as well. Once you get the hang of it, it only takes minutes to get ready for the next week."
3,Punkabilly,"The music of War Rocket Ajax can be characterized as punkabilly (or some have called it psychobilly, although I don't really feel that describes it) - punk with a constantly driving beat and a southern-fried feel.They do remind me of Social Distortion, but they don't sound like them. Instead, think Social D meets Offspring - but don't expect WRA to BE EXACTLY like either of these bands, because they're not. What you can expect is an album full of driving, upbeat punk rock with southern influences and some wry lyrics. For a change of pace, try War Rocket Ajax."
4,A good CD to add to your collection,"I bought this Cd a few days ago and I love it. I am good friends with the band and my band(General Direction) has played with them many times. The songs are catchy and well written, the lyrics are meaningful. Go check it out"
5,WHOAH,"Haha, this is just crazy. I just found out about this band the other day..but believe it or not.. The singer is my English teacher!!!! So I see this guy every day. He bursts out into song randomly and it's just awesome. I'm gonna come to school one day with these CD's and surprise him."
2,An alright punk attempt,"I picked this CD up mostly because it said it was ""for fans of Social Distortion"". It sounds nothing like them, & isn't really aggressive enough to be called punk. The tunes are catchy enough, & doesn't get preachy like most other Christian groups, but all in all, if you're looking for a good punk album, go buy Social D or some Offspring."
3,It is cool but too soft to be called hard rock .,"I bought the cd when my friend told my they were an awesome hard rock band. I think he was wrong about being a hard rock band, but he was right when he said they were a cool band."
4,Great book and fast shipping!,"My husband bought this book with the intention of only reading it for work purposes, since he's in the military, yet both of us actually enjoyed the book very much. The shipping was very quick and arrived before expected."
3,The author missed the most important point,"Even though Mr. Kaplan goes deeper into the recent Afghan history, he missed the most important point. He does not understand the profound meaning of the life of Ahmad Shah Massoud and the impact of this great leader, with great spirituality and a great vision, in the 23 years of Afghan Resistance. But who does? Very few as always when an important event happens in the world. Good book. Not a great book."
2,zzzzzz...,"As a college student, I am required certain books for my history class. The firsthand account books I have read this semester have been very enjoyable (Kaffir Boy & Son of the Revolution). However, even though Soldiers of God is a firsthand account of Robert Kaplan traveling in Afghanistan & Pakistan during the Soviet invasion & occupation, it was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I could barely read 3 pages without beginning to doze off. The action is limited and sporadic and the commentary is less than stellar. If you are looking for another Kaffir Boy this book is not the one to pick."
2,Missing in Action,"Way to boring. No real descriptions of any combat action. Just like boring historical statistical stuff. Lots of Afghan tribal stories, why they can't get along we may never know. If you want some edge of your seat and can't put it down action, skip this one."
2,Binding Fell Apart,"I noticed the review that said this book was worthy of ""permanent display on your coffee table."" Well, I don't think that will be possible with my book, as the binding fell apart after 6 months. The book has gotten a fair amount of use, but nothing out of the ordinary. I've since seen a similar problem with a couple of the display copies at bookstores (which is why they've been demoted to display copies). So I don't think this is an isolated problem. It seems like the book is so big that they didn't make a strong enough binding for it. So just a warning for this thinking of buying this book. The good news is that, on the advice of one of the reviews, I bought Colorado: Yesterday & Today to replace my copy of Colorado: 1870-2000. I agree that it is the better book and now it will be on permanent display on my coffe-table."
2,Don't buy this book,"Please, I don't buy this book except if you want for some reference. I bought my graduate school, for me were complete unuseful."
4,It's a home run,"Honus & Me.In Honus And Me Joe Stoshack finds a 206-Honus Wagner card while cleaning out his elderly neighbor Ms. Young's, attic.The conflict of this story is Joe can't decide if he should give the back to Ms.Young or sell the card for half a million dollars.This story takes place in Louisville,Kentucky where the most famous baseball bat was made. And Joe's mother's work place Hazelwood Hospital.In the resolution of this story Joe realizes that money can't fix everything. But before Joe could give the card back to Ms.Young Birbie from a baseball card shop,almost beats Joe up trying to steal the card. Then before Birdie could hurt Joe Ms.Young comes out with a rifle and saves him.I gave this story four stars because it's exciting and an amazing adventure."
2,Disappointing Experience,"I purchased four of these bars - three to use in the shower and one just outside the shower door. The three bars in the shower began to show signs of rust after about 2 week of use. I called a Mabis customer service rep who told me that the rust was probably due to the screws. They sent me new bars and I purchased 18 stainless steel screws at a local hardware store. Once installed the new bars also began to rust- obviously more than the screws were rusting! The layer of chrome seems to be very thin (it showed signs of pitting after only a few weeks). For the life of me, I can't believe a company would sell a a rust-prone product for use in a wet environment.I gave them two stars only because their customer service was extremely responsive and courteous."
4,preconceived notion,I thought this was a great book. I just had a problem with how it ended between Anthony & Imagany. In my opinion it should have been more detailed towards the end. After she stabbed him he faded out of the picture. What about the police filling charges? But outside of that I truly love the book.
1,I Tried Twice!!!!,"Unlike everyone else, I did not like this book at all.It had very unnecessary phrases in it, stuff I don't need to know like, what the person is wearing and things that does not even happen in real life. I KNOW ITS FICTION, BUT DAMN!!!I read Mrs. Williams other book a Twist of Fate and I didn't like that either, maybe I just don't like her as an author. I tried twice and I'm not going back again!"
4,Strong Characterization/Lots of Action,"With ""Preconceived Notions"" Robyn Williams wrote a memorable story filled with strong characterizations and a varied storyline. I loved the characters Imagany Jenkins, Elliott Renfroe and Caprice McKnight. Imagany's life was filled with drama as she fought to rise above childhood demons, a problematic relationship with a rich but controlling former boyfriend, and romantic challenges with football player Elliott Renfroe. I enjoyed the intimate scenes between Imagany and Elliott. They are detailed without going overboard. You feel like you're in the room with these two lovers. (Hmmm!). I must admit I didn't care for how the book ended because it seemed unrealistic, but other than that the story was well written and engaging. I'm glad to have come across Robyn's book and look forward to reading ""A Twist of Fate""."
4,Entertaining,"Robyn, this book was very entertaining, enjoyable and sensual. Very well written for a first novel. I have to read your second book to see if you can get just as exciting as this one."
4,Sweltering & Refreshing,"It was nice to read a novel depicting positive males, that know how to love. Robyn's ensemble of characters is delightful, and the poignant love scenes drip of emotions and ecstacy. Preconceived Notions is about unrelenting love, providential friendship, and extensile strength. You will enjoy reading it."
4,Love,This was one of the best love stories I have ever read. This book has true love and romance! Wow.....
1,Preconceived Notions,"I read the other reviews before buying this book (as I often do), however, I do not like the story or the characters. Imagany is shallow, Caprice seems to have no depth. Really, I am speechless...after reading what others said, I am wondering what is wrong with me. I didn't even finish the book."
5,A Great Read,"This was a great book to read all the way until the end. It was worth every cent. You won't be disappointed. I would like to see this one made into a movie. I'm looking forward to ""A Twist of Fate""."
4,Good Read,"This book is a good novel. Although in the first couple of chapters I felt that the book would be more fluff with no meat, once I got into the book,I was presently suprised. I was glad to see that Imagany gained some self awareness but was very disappointed that she did not feel or see the need to protect her sister much earlier on in the book. Unfortunately by the time she took the time to realize it, it was too late. Although a good read, the book was really somewhat sad. Even though Imagany found true happiness with a very loving and giving man, she seemed to recognize that she had to create and maintain her own identity. It is very good to read books where the character, especially female, comes away from a situation with the realization that she has to know who and what she is before she can try and give herself to someone else."
5,Powerful Story,"I found this book to be an excellent read. I didn't want the story to end. Incest is a subject that is far too often hidden from view. The aftermath of sexually abused girls is seldom discussed or written about. I cheered Imagony on. The book provoked thoughts about how mothers allow themselves to look the other way when their children are being abused. The main character was so real to me that I was able to vividly see her. The love between her and her chosen mate moved my soul. I felt the love, watched the heat. The author brought me totally into someones else's heart and head. I will be watching and reading Robyn Williams for the rest of my life. She is a very talented woman."
4,Kudos to Robyn Williams,"Preconceived Notions is the first romance novel I have ever read and it was well worth it. Imagany Jenkins was a sensuous, spirited black woman whose story had me page turning just to see what happened next. As a black man I wondered how I compared to Elliott Renfroe as a man. Kudos to Robyn Williams for a job well done. I am now off to get A Twist of Fate."
5,MAGNIFICENT!,This book is very exciting........There is never a dull moment and I enjoyed every minute of it! Way to go Ms. Robyn Williams this book is ggrrrrrr8!
4,Extremely Well Written,"""Preconceived..."" was very entertaining and realistic. Ms. Williams is a very talented and imaginative writer and I look forward to reading more of her work."
4,HEARTFELT,"BEFORE PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ROBYN WILLIAMS, AND FROM THIS BOOK ALONE I HAVE BECOME A FAN OF HERS. THE BOOK CAPTURED SO MANY DIFFERENT EMOTIONS UPON TURNING THE PAGES. THE ABILITY TO GET LOST INSIDE OF A BOOK SUCH AS I DID IS A TREAT FOR THE READER. THE CHARACTERS WHETHER THEY ARE ALL IMAGINARY ARE REAL THE PROTRAYL WAS EXCELLENT FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD. THE SINCE OF BEING IS ONE THAT WE ALL HAVE DELT WITH WITHIN OUR OWN LIVES AND I FELT FOR EACH ONE. I LOVED THE WAY SHE PROTRAYED ELLIOT A MAN OF MANY THAT EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD TODAY MARRIED OR SINGLE WISHES SHE HAD. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE A TASTE OF FATE."
5,A Very Good Book!,"I really enjoyed reading Preonceived Notions. This book was so good that I found it difficult to turn the light out at night. It was fast, easy reading yet the character development was right on target. Especially the love scenes. They were right up my alley! I have to admit, I've never read a book where the romance was as juicy and spicy as it is in Preconceived Notions. I am eagerly looking forward to reading the author's second book, A Twist of Fate."
5,A Must Have in Your Library,I read Preconceived Notions entirely in a one day period. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed every single page of this novel. I have bought copies for my friends and and truly believe that this is a Black literary classic as far as romances are concerned. I am eagerly waiting Robyn's second novel.
4,"One of the best black ""love"" stories I've read.","Don't have any Preconceived Notions about this piece of work! Although I read this book awhile ago, I still remember how it left me. It left me with a very satisfied feeling. The plot, the characters, the flow of the story were all fantastic. This book is great and you,the reader will not be disappointed!"
5,A MUST READ,"Preconceived Notions started out slow to me. However, I was not disappointed at all. What a wonderful love story. No way, could I have predicted what would happen in the book. Great debut! I quickly bought her second novel, A Twist of Fate after reading this book and again, I was not disappointed!"
2,I did not like!,"When I first began reading this book, I thought I would like it. As I got into how much of a golddigger Imagany was, I knew I wouldn't like it. The reason I gave this book 2 stars was because Anthony beat her down. Yeah, I am a female."
2,What's the big deal?,"After hearing so much about this book from coworkers and other book lovers, I decided to give it a shot. I found the plot to be really basic with nothing new that we haven't already seen in the resurgence of African-American fiction titles these days. I felt that Ms. Williams was writing for a not so sophisticated reader as I thought that she spent too much time going into unnecessary detail about Elliott's football games, etc. Who cares? There should have been more detail given to her parents and their issues and how they affected Imagany. I'm glad this was a paperback."
5,"This novel explores dreams, values, insecurities & realities","Robyn Williams' novel, Preconceived Notions is a solid literary contribution to the emerging number of African American romance and fiction books that color the bookshelves. Williams gives primary characters Imagany Jenkins and her love interest Elliott Renfroe realistic substance. Readers know authentic people like the characters portrayed in this book. The internal and external conflicts presented, reminds us of some of our own situations or those of close friends and provided an opportunity to revisit them. This story is complete with drama, romance, suspense and tragedy. The author is talented and has instantaneously generated a readership. I am looking forward to reading her next novel."
5,The Bold and the Beautiful,"This book is without a doubt the best book I have read in a long time. Robyn Williams charcters are passionate and giving. Imagany is a strong black woman who knows what she wants and goes out and gets it. Elliott is a real black man, he was there for Imagany to the end and never judged her for the mistakes that she may have made. I would for sure recommend this book to all of my friends."
2,I'll wait for the paperback on the next one......,The author tries to cram in too much! The story tends to wander at times. It was an okay read however; it reinforces some negative stereotypes of African American sexuality
3,A main character with dubious morals,"I am a little over a quarter of the way through this book and my issues is this, the hero gratifying that she is using a man to support her. She is a glorified whore. The way these African American woman talk, the way they interact is really poor form."
3,fun but didn't work well,"I loved the John Deere theme. My grandson is going to be one in a month and loved all the noise and song. BUT! the doors stuck and then they wouldn't close! The whole purpose is to have the doors open and close when you press or turn the right knob. As it is, you have to slam the doors shut and he can't do it so I do it for him...On the other hand my three year old grandy has no problem slamming the doors!! :)"
3,Frustrating for my 20 month old,"My 20 month old gets frustrated with this toy, because you have to do different things to ""feed the farm animals"" and to get them to pop out. She wants to push all the buttons down, and does not understand that she needs to push one forward and twist one, even though I have showed her repeatedly. At the sitters, she loved a pop up toy where she just had to push the buttons. Maybe with time she will figure it out. But she gets quite frustrated with it now. The toy does seem to be quite durable and when I do help her get all the animals to come out and eat, she really likes the song. It might be better for a 2 year old."
2,There is no English translation as the CDs play. It is maddening not to know what they're saying!,"The CDs desperately need an English translation immediately following a Spanish word or phrase. Otherwise, we have no concept of what we're saying, or when to use the word or phrase."
1,completely useless,False advertising! The audio CD package claims that you can learn spanish listening to the CD's in your car without a textbook.The CD's are 100% in spanish and do not provide any translation. You have to look up the PDF files for the english translation. This is not possible when you are driving 60mph down the highway!How hard is it to put the english translation on the CD???
3,Review,"I just received this toy for my son who is in the process of being potty trained. I have never written a review before but felt compelled to write one. This toy IS NOT worth [...]. It is flimsy and IMO cheaply made. It has TONS of small peices to be assembled - including putting small stickers on it everywhere (this is difficult to do with small kids running around). It also does not come with any of the small cars needed - and I can't find them online anywhere. It appears much bigger in the picture then it actually is.I am really disappointed. It looked so nice online but even my almost 4 year old said it looked ""different"".Ugggh! Off to search for the tiny micro cars it needs."
5,Good Deal,"I've been using it for about a month now and i've made severals proves to this memory, instaling games and heavy programs as photoshop cs3 , portal, half life 2 , unreal tournament..... well i can tell that i can run them very well and super fast. before that i wasnt able to run none of this. so i think this is a good deal for the price. and i'm satisfied about my shop."
5,YES!,"Thank the lord, this product IS as advertised! Initially, my Toshiba notebook was running on 1 GB of RAM. After installing this 2 GB stick, there is indeed a definite performance boost. I am very pleased with my purchase using amazon and the price was fantastic. Highly recommended"
5,"I love it, but it's not for everyone","Roach provides useful route descriptions for all of the RMNP peaks, but more importantly, he communicates his enthusiasm for the alpine experience that the peaks provide. Some may wish his descriptions were more detailed. Personally, I prefer less detail, which forces the reader-hiker to use his/her judgment & experience when route-finding (rather than slavishly following a detailed list of instructions)."
5,Mini Tarot -- A Great Size & Good Artwork,"This deck is a good alternative to the traditional Rider-Waite Tarot, and I enjoy the images on papyrus. A perspective buyer should know that while the cards do parallel the Rider-Waite deck, the names of some of the cards are slightly different.RW = Cups, while Egyptian = Chalices, for example.Overall, the size and the artwork make this a great deck for the beginner or the devotee of Tarot. Highly recommended.Morgen1967@aol.com"
4,A well remembered song,"Pure nostalgia led me to this album. Back in the late 1950s, a popular disk jockey on a local radio station used Earl Bostic's recording of ""Where or When"" as his theme song. That song stuck with me and led to a search for an album. The song is still as fresh as it seemed more than 50 years ago. The music may not be to everyone's taste, and some of it isn't all that memorable, but it's a unique sound and his almost rock and roll treatment of some standards is something I enjoy hearing over and over."
5,Audra's amazing to see!,"While the resolution on the video isn't the greatest quality, you WON'T CARE once you see it because, in any light, Audra is captivating. If you've heard her recordings you know that she is a talented and sensitive musician, but seeing those gifts combined with her ability to fully emulate the character of every song just about takes your breath away. Any other video of a solo singer in concert might put you to sleep, but Audra's acting is so amazing, her characterizations are so authentic, that you can't take your eyes off her. Oh yeah, and she sounds amazing too. ;-) A must-have for Audra fans."
5,The Smurf DVD,These shows brought hours of enjoyment when my kids were little and now my grandchildren are being entertained by the same little blue guys their daddies loved.
3,This book is a group of essays,"This book is a collection of essays on the historical theory of the 'Crisis of the Seventeenth Century'. The basis of this theory is that do to a number of reasons, European counries jointly experainced national crisises during the Seventeenth Century. As the Seventeenth Century includes the Thirty Years War and the English Revelution this sounds like an plaudible theory. Some modern historians theorize that the poor weather was the cause of this general Crisis. Taking this train of logic to its natural conclusion, the book includes a number of essays on whether there was a General Crisis in the entire world or not. In my opinion, this book is intended for the serious History student and is certainly not good for someone who doesn't already know the History of the Seventeenth Century."
2,Too many scenes that are cut.,"I remember watching this movie on Cinamax in the early 90's. I remember the sex scense are alot longer and alot more sexually explicit compare to the VHS RATED R version that is on sale now. It would be great to have both the UNRATED and RATED R Versions on DVD but unfortionately, they don't. I would recommend before buying, check if it is the UNRATED Version becouse it is alot better. The Rated R Version is not worth buying."
2,not what I remember,The videotape version was edited down from the version I remembered so fondly from late-night cable TV.
4,AGENDA GARFIELD,"BUENO, CREO QUE GARFIELD NO NECESITA NI PRESENTACION PORQUE YA TODOS LO CONOCEMOS, EL SARCASTICO GATO QUE PARA HACIENDO DE LAS SUYAS CONTRA EL POBRE Y NO MUY INTELIGENTE ODDIE Y SU AMO JOHN, QUE ES UN CHICO DE CAMPO QUE MAS QUE NADA ES UN POBRE NERD. ESTA AGENDA ES AMENA Y DIVERTIDA CADA PAGINA TIENE UNA NUEVA TIRA COMICA DE GARFIELD EN CASTELLO. CREO QUE ES UNA BUENA ELECCION SI ES QUE TE GUSTAN LOS COMICS."
5,AWESOME Bible from Tyndale,"I love Bibles that are easy to read, don't weigh too much and are not too bulky. If you are like me, you will LOVE this Bible. I have been using a Tyndale (The Living Translation) Bible since 1995 (which I love very much), and I was very pleased when I received this Tyndale (New Living Translation) Bible. The Large Print is larger than regular print Bibles, but it is not as large as alot of large print Bibles. But then again, it's ""very"" slim! (The Slim""est"" Large Print Bible that I've seen on the market) The Bonded Leather has a quality feel to it. I Highly Recommended this Bible to Everyone!."
2,Poor durability/construction!,"This was fun while it lasted...which was not very long.My son received this as a Christmas gift, it was used inside lightly until about a month ago, when it has been used outside a few times a week, but gently. It has already fallen apart and most of the stickers have come off. I'm going to follow another reviewers advice and try gorilla glue.My son is an only child, so no older heavier kids beating this up and he is pretty gentle on it...so the only conclusion I can come to is that its just poorly made. Its sad because it is a nice size/design for good riding...but don't buy if you are wanting something to pass down between kids."
4,Wonderful baby-powered ride on toy!!,"My little boy got this tractor for Christmas last year when he was 9 months old. He has played with it literally every day since!! He has gotten so tall that he just stands over it and runs now (he is 20 months), so we will be retiring it after he gets a tricycle for Christmas. We are farmers, so he thinks he's a big man like his daddy and granddaddy when he ""drives"" his John Deere tractor.The only reason I didn't give this toy 5 stars is because 2 of the wheel stickers came off early on, and the rest of the stickers are very ragged around the edges. My little boy could care less, he just loves his tractor."
2,Cheap all the way around,"This was purchased for my two year old nephew. He thinks that is great. It took too long to assemble! The stickers don't stay in place at all. The product is all green. The details you see in the picture are all stickers. So, now imagine what this looks like without stickers. Disappointing!"
2,Poorly-made,"I am so sad, because it really is the cutest toy and my nephew loved it. However, it is NOT sturdy at all, and the stickers all fall off! The screws that came with it do not hold it together (after 1 ride it started falling apart) so I tried some thicker screws. They still didn't hold it, so I actually tried filling the gaps and adding strength with super glue (didn't work) and Gorilla glue (didn't work). All in all, it is very poorly made, and of course, it is made in China. The stickers also fall off, rendering it just a green tractor. Oh, and this wasn't a problem for us, but it is very small - it's really only made for 1-2 yr olds. Even my 3 yr old niece was too big for it."
4,Tractor,I was impressed using amazon.com. I was going crazy looking for this tractor for my nephew. He is a small 2 year old and this product was the right size. According to his father assembly was easy.Thank you John Deere for making a small version of a tractor. My nephew is really into tractors.
3,Will it last??,"One year old loved it. It was easy for him to get on and off and to ride. My concern is that when I put it together, the screws didn't feel like they were holding very well. The front part will probably end up having to be re-screwed and glued to stay together."
1,Poor quality,"If you are looking for a good John Deere toy tractor, this is not it. If you are looking for a nice green toy tractor, this may do. The stickers on this model will peel off on their own within an hour of adhering them to the tractor. Manufacturer says to ship back to place purchased and ask for refund, but no parts are available even if you have missing parts. I have spoken with others that own the same toy and same thing happened to their stickers too. So if you buy it, don't waste your time placing the stickers on it."
1,Piece of junk,"This is the worst ride on toy I've ever seen. The only thing good is the price, but what good is a low price when you are left with junk, it's still a waste of money. Doesn't fit together properly, stickers are not sticky and retain half their paper backing, we are returning this as soon as possible."
5,"Funny, weird and Death on a bicycle","This book is excellent. Narrated in turns by two of the characters we get different perpectives of events. There are some cliche elements of life in a country estate - how to kill the pet rabbit and pee in the sink if you can't find the toilet, but the complete madness of the characters makes it seem normal. A good romantic comedy without the usual soppy traditions."
2,I was very disappointed,"The premise was fantastic. A futuristic political thriller, serial murder mystery. Maybe it tried to be too much, but it became highly predictable after you got into it. I was raving about it for about 50 pages, then it became too wordy. Too much of the political and not enough dealings with the serial killings. I expected the serial killings to be more in the forefront of the story as opposed to a steady dose of politics. I won't recommend this book. Even though I got through it, it was tedious."
4,Impressive novel by James,"The story that James weaves around a rebuilding (again) Russia after civil war is suberb. He has created a place that is both sinister and frighening real. I enjoyed the way the the plot twisted and turned. I was surprised at James for his belief that modern life has no ideology, no beliefs. All people belief in, in his world, is power and money. I hope he is wrong."
4,not your typical serial killer-novel,"I review this book before I read it completely, because I expect, like with every serial killer-novel, a disappointing climax. But Monstrum is a highly entertaining, but also intelligent thriller with subplots that maybe are a little farfetched. The main characters sparkle with wit and Donald James knows how to write about the numbness of the Russian people."
5,Simply Brilliant,"Don't fool yourself it is a difficult book to read and I strongly recommend a sound knowledge of Russian history and Russian habits. Otherwise superb read,deep and breathtaking,original,and a well executed novel. Bravo Donald."
1,Very Boring,"A really badly written story,the events do not flow smoothly with too many unnecessary sexual encounters described. It's definitely too long with very boring details. The characters are all unrealistically extreme. I can't think of anything positive to say about this supposedly great saga."
1,Another Book by a non professional and non clinician..,"This author has flooded Amazon and Journals with books and articles without an ounce of clinical experience. She has only taught college and has never ONCE seen a real-live patient. This book, along with the others, are so far off base and have no inclusion of important DSM IV and V criteria; differential diagnosis and solid clinical experience. yet she touts herself as an expert without ever evaluating or treating a child? Impossible to believe a word in any of her publications as she is skewed in relying on only "" her teaching a a few research articles"" vs true clinical practice. yet she pontificates from her ( retired ) teaching at a small college and criticizes true experts and feels she is some type of expert. Not even licensed.....another book written by an amature and non professional."
2,A Bit Pale in Quality,"I saw this movie years ago, and being your typical arm chair treasure hunter, was glad to see it was available on DVD. I remembered how the movie caught the overallperseverance, dedication and meager existence of a team of dreamers that had them saying ""Today's the day!"" every time they went out in search of the Atocha. Loaded with gold and silver, the Spanish ship sank in a storm somewhere off the Florida Keys in 1622. The crew worked for 16 years before seeing any kind of pay day. It's a great story. However, the rich turquoise waters and scenes of beautiful beaches of Key West were all washed out and almost void of color. The whole movie looked like it was shot at the wrong exposure. I was very disappointed with the quality of color having seen it before back in the 80's on TV in rich vibrant color. I give this moviea low rating not because of the movie itself, but because the DVD transfer process used washed out so much of it's color."
5,Mel Fischer,I have always been a fan of the late Mel Fischer. This is a video of the TV movie made in the '80's (I believe). Decent quality for the time it was made. I enjoyed it-worth the price.
3,Dreams of Gold,"Dreams of Gold was a made for TV movie about Mel Fisher. The movie details the struggles as well as the success of the Fisher family, from their long struggle trying to find lost sunken treasure; loss of their son and daughter-in-law at sea as well as their battle with the State of Florida in the Supreme Court."
2,"Great idea, quality not great",The space saving design is wonderful. The plastic containers are poor quality. They break too easily.
5,Nice item,"Item was fine, arrived in great condition, and arrived as described online. No complaints at this time with this purchase."
1,I will review SMART SPIN - If I ever receive it!,"I ordered Smart Spin from the As Seen On TV website on 12/22/2004. It is now 2/14/2005 and I still have not received it. They charged my credit card on 1/13/2005, the day they say they shipped it by BULK US MAIL (I have never had something like this shipped via bulk mail!)!!!! It turns out they will not help you with anything until the 6 weeks are up from the day they decided to ship it. You never know when that will be. Their ad and confirmation e-mail both say 2-6 weeks for delivery. Nowhere does it say from the time they ship it which in my case was 3 weeks after I ordered it!"
4,"Helped with the clutter , not high quality though","Bought at Smart Spin set at the local Walmart. Threw away all of the mis-matched tupperware containers that had been hogging up my container cupboard. Thus far it has proved to be worth the $15 bucks I shelled out. It DOES keep the storage area tidy adn neat. It is convienent that all tops match all bottoms.The on downside, the containers and lids are sorta cheap feeling. Not very heavy or sturdy. I am not sure that these containers will last more than a year or so... also the spinner rack is a bit shoddy, but it has not broken so far... it just seems kinda lightweight and flimsy...But, if my containers start to beak there are always the refill or expansion packs..."
4,Space Saver,I would recommend this product. It takes up less space and everything especially the lids stay put. It is easy to put together and works well.
1,Horrible!,I would not know anything about the actual product-it's been 2 months and I still have not recieved it! The customer service number on the smart spin web site only refers you to another number (not toll free). Smart Spin does not answer e-mails. Wish I could give a zero rating!
2,"saves space, not money",I love the idea behind this product but many of the containers have cracked or broken even though they have received the same treatment as all my other leftover brands. I am dissappointed in their quality. I wish I had spent the money on a different set of containers.
4,Try one...,"I am very satisfied. It meet my expectation for $20.00.My wife is happy, which makes me happy. Try one...It will keep your food fresh and ready to eat next day."
4,cleared my cluttered cabinet,"I ordered one of these sets for myself and one for my mother. We both love them. They are sturdy and easy to use, and the lids are all one size and fit all the containers, so no trying to keep the correct lid with the corresponding bowl. I was able to clean up that awful ""tupperware cabinet"" that we all seem to have after accumulating years of the stuff. Gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because it might be too tall for some cabinets. It didn't fit where I wanted to put it, but I was able to find someplace else for it. All in all, one of my better buys!"
4,Great for my kid's lunch,"I've had it a month, so far so good. Some of the complaints I read in other reviews are moot for me. They haven't cracked. The lids are easy once you get used to them. It doesn't fit in my cabinet because my cabinets are old and a little smaller, so it fits nicely in a deep drawer and I'm pleased with that. The small size of the containers work perfectly for my son's lunch and snacks that I pack daily. Other small containers I have used open up easily, but not these. Perhaps other people's containers are cracking because they are used in the freezer or refrigerator, but since we rarely use them for that, well, I'm quite pleased. I wish, however, one could order replacement containers for them, as little guy is prone to forgetting one now and then."
1,This is lousy,"I just got my smart spin in the mail. All of the taller containers (which are extremely small) are stuck together and all are cracked. What a waste of money! Don't bother with this one.By the way, the customer service number is not toll free. How convenient for them."
1,Tiny pieces of crap!!,"The commercial on TV gives you the impression that these items are bigger than you would expect. They are so small and rinky-dink, that you can't fit a darn thing in them. This is by far the biggest ripoff EVER. By the way, I have been waiting for over 2 weeks to get information on how to get a refund, which is horrible!! Don't waste a single cent on this crap, unless you are GI Joe and have to store ant-sized portions!! I'd give it a negative star rating if possible, but 1 star is as low as I am allowed."
4,Wish they had one a little larger,"This is a great product. The lids fit tightly and it is microwavable. I was able to throw away all the margarine tubs, etc. Too bad there wasn't at least a couple of larger containers."
2,Product is OK but the idea is really NICE,"'Smart Spin Storage System' is a great idea turned into a not-so-great product. I bought mine from an As seen on TV store locally. The containers are fine but lids are NOT 'easily pillable' as they show on the infomercial. The containers are smaller than they seem but that's not really the issue. I will not recommend for anyone to mail order this item, because the returns are hassle. Try buying from a local store, check the store's return policy so you can return it if you don't like it."
5,Great plate hanger for smaller items!,"I was having difficulty finding a hanger for several 5"" plates and luckily found this product! In addition to the size it accommodates, it comes with the hardware to attach to the wall. Highly recommend."
3,Washable blue ink,"This is the same as Pelikan 4001 Blue or Royal Blue. This ink, like most blue inks for fountain pens, dries to a lighter hue than most blue inks from ballpoint and rollerball/gel pens. It is washable, so parents can give it to children without worrying. It is chemically erasable/eradicable by eradicators like the Pelikan Super-Pirat, which is convenient for students. It is not safe for writing checks. It is not for two-sided writing on bad paper. It is popular with fountain-pen enthusiasts. It feels good during writing. There are darker blue inks for fountain pens."
4,works great,"Love the review from the guy who never plugged it in...anyway, seems to be working fine for me. I have my Directv receiver and a DVD player split with no noticable loss of video quality or sound from either piece. The only complaint I have is that the remote included only seems to work from a max distance of about 10 feet. This can be remedied if you have a programmable remote."
1,Horrible Product,"Stay away from this product. The only thing that works well about this, is the remote that comes with it. The picture quality if HORRIBLE. It doesn't properly transfer the signal over and just creates a horrible quality image. I tried it with several different products and one two separate televisions to make sure it wasn't on my end. Seriously, you can buy better products than this here on Amazon. Do NOT buy this product."
3,wired wrong,"this was a replacement for another similar model that shorted out.this updated model had one of the channels wired wrong and the sound does not work on that channel.got the video to work by chance, switched the jacks in different holes that it should not have gone in and got the video to come on. Go figure!Hate sending stuff back so will live with it till it goes like the first one."
1,"Does NOT output stereo signal ,L&R mono'd","Does NOT output stereo signal ,L&R; mono'dIt's such a shame that this product is deceptive,There is no excuse for a mono'd audio output.I lived with this for over a year,till I just knew that something was wrong.After hours of plying with the sound system(who would suspect a mono output from a modern video switch)I found the problem,Oh I was pissed."
1,Don't buy this,"I have had a couple of these and they randomly change channels. Lately, every few minutes or seconds. We were watching a streaming movie from netflix last night via our Roku player and I must have had to change the video channel 30-40 times."
1,defective,this product was easy to set up but the problem i have with it is if i am watching something on any input besides 1 then it will automactically switch over to input 1.you have to keep the remote handy so you can swicth it back to the desired inputi really hate this product and it is going in the trash. i guess this is what i get for buying something cheap
1,Unreliable and video degradation,Unit was simple to install. There is however video degradation and the unit seems susceptible to interference when it's close to other devices.I returned to this review after 9 months and reduced my rating from 2 stars to 1. The unit has developed a flaw that causes it to randomly switch to Input 2. This can be terribly annoying when you are in the middle of a game or watching a program.I recommend that you find another device.
1,Autoswitching is apparently a 'feature',"Good Points:1. Remote Control2. 4 inputs3. sleek designBad Points:1. Does not like white. Screen signals with heavy white usage tend to cause distortion, wavy lines or just black screens where it has to re-sync.2. Auto switches from a higher channel back to channel one after about ten minutes of use. Talk about frustrating. It ends up being faster to unplug channel 3 and plug it back into channel one.Those two very big draw backs make this item a complete POS. Don't purchase it."
2,Horrible Video Degradation.,"Not a bad product if you're on a budget, however expect the HD signal to be significantly deteriorated when plugged up. I was rather disappointed, but for the price I shouldn't be surprised. However, no lie, it's a really bad signal. If video quality is important to you then do not buy this mod.This is the first time a budget buy has screwed me over, but live and learn."
3,"Good, but one big annoying flaw...","It spontaneously switches from one input the previous input. Very annoying, especially when playing a game or watching tv."
2,You need to know the full story before purchase,"The only problem I have with this item is that it can be used for commponent devices or composite devices, but not a mix of the two. The desription did not state this."
1,Mal equipo,La peor compra que he hecho. pierde la calidad del video. no lo recomiendo. Lo peor es que vivo en venezuela y me ha salido mas caro. Ahora tengo q comprar otro porq la calidad de video es lo que cuenta. Repito no lo compren
1,Worst product ever.,"Tried hooking up both Wii and Xbox 360 to the switch.Color got washed out, text was very blurry. This productsucks so bad."
2,Quality was horrible.,"When I received this item, the item was scratched in the input area. I didn't even bother testing whether it worked or not because the scratches disappointed me. I returned it."
3,"Shocking and sexy, in a twisted way","Calling this a sequel to Naked Killer is a bit of a stretch - some of the actors are the same, but the feel is very different. Over the top? Oh, yes, no question, with the Asian facination with rape very obvious here. Worth a look? Well, there's a high kink factor here which cannot be ignored, but it will only appeal to certain tastes, and that's all you'll get from this flick."
1,I should have known better .....,Thank to have bought this DVD .... The only redeeming quality of this DVD is that the women n it are faboulous although we dont get to see much of them ... I mean you see more flesh on some of the late night networks ...Appart from the dismal subtitles that will make you roll on the floor ... ie ... they continously translate good bye with a 'Buy Bye' so you can imagine what they did to the language where there were complete sentences with more than one word .... the thing that got me were the men in this movie ... the lawyer rapist is a very displeasing characted even for a bad guy .. and the head of the triad ... is a complete idiot .....I would say the triad in Hong Kong would probably be very very upset to be portayed by this simpering idiot .... As a final note I have no idea whatsoever where they got the title from ... considering the quality of this DVD they should change the title from 'Raped by an Angel' to just plain 'Screwed' ....
2,"Not a problem with they play, but a problem with the edition","I believe this is a poorly rendered version of Antony and Cleopatra. The organization of the notes made it difficult to read. Instead of putting the archaic meanings of words at the bottom as footnotes, it would have been much more helpful to place them in the margins. The constant going back-and-forth between footnotes and the text made my reading of this play less enjoyable."
3,"Cool, but . . .","My wife really liked this gift, it looked very cool, but the little swirley dangely thing broke off after a month or two."
4,An excellent overview of Albania in World War Two,"This is a masterful history of Albania's travails during the last war and relates in fine and often laconic detail how the Italians in particular made such a mess of first invading and then administering the country that it helped trigger their eventual capitulation in 1943. The author is also good on how the Germans picked up the pieces and made a much more professional attempt to manage the country before their efforts also soured. There are on occasion too many Albanian surnames littering the text but don't let this put you off. If you have any interest in Albanian history, this is the book for you."
5,The blight of Albania told amazingly,"I picked up this book after a conversation with Mr. Fischer. It is an extrodinary read. His ability to lay out the facts while at the same time conveying the hopelessness of the situation are achieved amazingly well. Not only do we learn that the Italians were a pathetic military, but we learn that without the germans, they would have lost to peasants. A great read for anyone"
3,Albania at War; not bad,"Albania at War by Bernd J. Fischer gives a good picture of the internal and external factors that impacted Albania during the first half of the 20th century. I read this book for a graduate History class on Modern Europe; it provided good information in a relatively concise package. Albania at War looks at King Zog, Mussolini's Italy, Germany, and the Allies. Fischer also spends a good portion of the book examining the internal struggles for power in Albania: the communists, King Zog, as well as nationalist leaders."
4,the book fills amuch needed void in Albanian history,"I always wondered what really went on in Albania during World War II. Frankly, you could not rely on the later slanted writings of Enver Hoxha to find out because Hoxha simply rewrote history to come out the way he wanted it to come out.This book provides the answers. Peter Lucas"
5,Dr. T Singalong for babies,"Dr. T's Sing-a-long ""Kid's Classics""My grandchildren loved this from the time they were 9 months old (sitting on my lap) until about age 6. What other software would cover such an age span? The music and singing are not tiresome for an adult to listen to. The quality is excellent. Unfortunately, we've all progressed beyond windows 95 so the newest grandchild cannot benefit from this great program."
4,"Fun, fashionable knits for kids","I am an intermediate knitter and I thought this was a great book. My friends are all having their first babies, and I love to knit - what better excuse for me to knit up something small and fun? I tried one of the Inca hats in the book using my own leftover yarns. It turned out great. The only caveat to this one pattern was that it didn't specify which way to have the ear flaps facing when picking up the stitches for beginning the rest of the hat - and of course, mine faced the wrong way. But I worked with it and it turned out very cute.All in all a good book, great pictures, clear (almost!) instructions and the designs are actually attractive and modern - something that can be hard to find in the myriad of knitting books out there. If the kids you know are dressed in Gap clothing, then these knits will fit right in."
4,"Great looking patterns, but I have found errors","I have a boy and a girl and there are several patterns in this book that I'm looking forward to making them. There are some really cute sweater patterns. Most of the patterns are pretty straightforward and should be fairly quick knits.I am working on the Fisherman sweater for my son and have found a couple of errors in the pattern. I figured them out pretty quickly and didn't have to undo a lot of work. And I am really happy with how it looks, but it is very annoying to encounter errors in a pattern. It doesn't look like anyone else has found any errors, so I'll probably try some of the others I had flagged."
3,Hard boiled with a bit of SF,"The *hero* is rather 1930's in attitude and it is some time in the future, with exotic weapons and cars. Took several pages to get going, but grows on one. Not a bad read at all. If Bond and The Saint are up your alley, you should like this one"
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my daughter. She loved the book, I Am Regina, which she read for school. We looked on Amazon for something similar. This one showed up in the also boughts and the description sounded good. However when she started reading it, she said it was ""Really weird and had a lot of swearing."" Not exactly what I had in mind for my 12 year old to read."
5,A book that you will truly want to read again and again.,"As you close the final page of this book it is only a matter of time befor you pick it up again. I was 16 when I read the book for the first time, simply to do a book report. Soon after I bought the book and read it again. It has been read so many times that the cover and pages are just about worn out. I have never read a story that has captured my heart and imagination like the story of Ride the Wind. You will laugh, cry and actually feel the joy and pain of the people. If you like to be completly envelloped in a story, please take the time to read this book...thank you Lucia."
5,"Captivating story, a real page turner!","An excellent story of a young girl growing up as a captive with the Comanche nation. From page 1 Cynthia's story keeps you enthralled with her life as Naduah. You meet her family and friends, and fall in love with her as she grows to womanhood and marrys Wanderer. In the end you'll cry as you feel her die as a white woman again. A definite must read, one of my real favorites"
5,One off the best i ever did read!,I like the book so much that we named our daughter after her and I hope that she will look very much like her. Naduah will always stay warm in our hearts! I did read the book in one weekend.
5,It's so great - I want it in hard back!,This was buy far the best book I have ever read. I dug it out last year and gave it to my husband to read - he passed it on and it is still making it's way around our community. I want it in hard cover! Very well written and a pheonominal story!
5,Great story,Great story well written and one which I shall certainly read again. Gave a real in- site into the Comanche nation.
5,Great Read,"I originally picked up this novel because my husband is related to Cynthia Ann and Quanah...but I kept reading it becuase it is WONDERFULLY written and tells the TRUE story..not some ""adaptation"" of the indians and their way of life...Great reading...I bought copies for all my yankee relatives so they could have a ""real"" understanding of the heritage of the Indians."
2,Not what I expected.,"After finishing ""Empire of the Summer Moon"", I was really excited to read more about the life, times and family of Quana Parker, what I got however was more like a Harlequin romance than a historical depiction of life on the Great Plains. The flowery over romanticized attempts to place the reader in Cynthia Ann Parker's shoes just didn't do it for the history buff in me. I made it about 100 pages, waiting like the story, but it just wasn't happening for me."
5,Ride the Wind,"I love the book. I had already read it a few years ago in paperback. I bought it from Jim's Stuff online. He had e-mailed me an updated description of some minor damage on the book. At that time I was hesitant as to buy it or not. To me $72 is a lot to pay for a book. I chose to buy it anyhow. The book is a really good read.I recieved it in just a couple of days. I was surprised how fast I got it. Over all I am very happy with my purchase. Except, and here is where the seller wanted me to delete my honest feedback on the purchase. But the binding was in rather poor condition. Had I known that, I wouldn't have paid that much for that copy. Non the less I feel as always a very satisfied customer of Amazon's."
4,Ride the Wind,"A fascinating portrait of the Comanche nation on the cusp of their appalling treatment by the whites when they were virtually starved into submission and herdednon to the reservations. Although the writer does not spare the reader from the atrocities perpetrated by both sides of the conflict, she gives us a wonderful insight into the ways of the Comanches from the point of view of the captured girl Cynthia Ann Parker, and her transformation into a Comanche woman. One whose life was ruined by her recapture by the whites later in life after her marriage to a member of the tribe and the birth of her children. Very sad portrait of her demise as she longs for her Indian husband. There is a moving portrait of their courtship and marriage, a marriage which survived much bloodshed and difficulties and were the protagonists were portrayed as being deeply committed to each other. All iN all a great read."
3,Or ...,"Or you could try the novelization written by Douglas C. Jones,Season of Yellow Leaf. Very very good, go try it. It's probably in your library."
1,Not for the discriminating reader,"Unfortunately, the real Cynthia Ann Parker never talked about her capture and her life with the Comanches, so her story is wide-open to exploitation by amateurish sensation writers.On the technical side, the narrative jumps haphazardly from one character to the next, which is confusing because the reader never knows whose eyes (s)he is looking through.On the plot side, the story suffers from an overabundance of flat characters and unnecessary sidestories. Combined with the wobbly POV and the detailed descriptions of violence and sex, this makes for an uninspiring, often outright annoying read."
5,Haunting,"This book affected me deeply. I live within close proximity of a town called Comanche, and for months after I read the book, I'd be forced to look away from the sign telling how many miles away the community is because I couldn't bear to look at the word. I had my son read the book, and I asked him what he thought about it. He replied, ""I don't want to talk about it.""The work is thoroughly researched and the conflict between the Comanche tribe and those who want them removed from the plains of Texas is a heartbreaking tale. Of course, the tale revolves around Cynthia Parker and her family, both native American and Anglo, and she is portrayed in a way that will break your heart.Ironically, one of my ancestors was on a mission with the US Army under the command of McKenzie and actually saw Quanah Parker in a battle in Palo Duro Canyon.This is a powerful story; read it and see how you respond. I'd like to know!"
4,Excellent read. Long but descriptive.,"This is and excellent enjoyable read. It does leave one wondering how much research went into the background of Ms. Robson's work. She describes how wonderful the Indian tribes were to their captive white children. She does go into the very poor treatment of more mature captives. As a juxtoposition, one could read the short novel ""Where the Broken Heart Still Beats"" 'The Story of Cynthia Ann Parker' by Carolyn Meyer."
4,An effective supplement,"I have been taking the green tea supplement for 4 weeks, twice the dose that the bottle recommends, walking 20 minutes daily and have lost 21 lbs. without any change in my diet. (I still enjoy the occasional cheeseburger and fries). I have yet to found another supplement that yielded that kind of result. I don't know if the weight loss was due to the walking or the green tea, or the combination, but I do suggest trying this routine. Swanson Vitamins is the most inexpensive source I have found (with fast mail delivery) and walking is really kind of addictive. I had a hard time at first going out to walk, but wanted to see if the plan would work and I can easily say, it did. Good luck to you! One thing I can say with certainty, is that the supplements I have purchased from Swanson have been cheaper than most and still effective."
3,It's Not As Good As They Say...Is It?,"This get's a half stack review as I call it.It's NOT even comparable to other pills for weight loss as they claim.I doubt there's as much tea in it as they say. I can drink a cup of Green tea and get a good feeling, looser bowels etc and with this, as many as I take, it takes ages to kick in, has NO buzz, and make me question how much is REALLY in here, and much more importantly, what is in here.Sawdust>?It's just misleading to tag as a weight loss or cardiovascular aid.Your better off drinking green tea or getting a REAL batch of green tea pills. I did this to save the annoying procedure that brewing tea can be; and to be able to have more than a cup in a few capsules, well this disappointed me....No wonder it's so cheap (in 2 senses of the word)."
3,Kudos to Swanson Vitamins!,"Congratulations to Swanson Vitamins for being the first to capsule whole green tea instead of green tea extract at a very affordable price! Green tea extract does contain many beneficial antioxidants such as EGCG, but also poses certain risks because it is not a whole food, and label precautions must be followed. This whole food product has none of these risks. But what benefits does it deliver? The label only lists green tea leaves as the sole ingredient. We offer a premium green tea vegetarian capsule product (Guardian From the Earth Whole Food Green Tea Capsules) where the nutrients (EGCG, catechins, polyphenols) are listed on the label, and they are competitive to green tea extract products without the risk."
2,i don't like it.,I use my Green tee pills to make myself green tea(with watter and all) but with these pills its impossible. yea you can open up the pill and yea you can put them in watter but they don't mix well with watter and they tend to go down to the bottom of the bottle. so i know most people don't use pills for that but for me it wasn't the best pick.
4,10 or more cups of tea vs 1-2 supplements,I don't feel like drinking a ridiculous amount of tea to get the same results from 1-2 supplements. I personally do not like the taste of green tea so the supplements work great for me :)
3,Makes me jittery,"Not sure if it is helping me with weight loss, but it does make me a bit jittery, more so than any cup of tea or coffee. It's too soon to tell."
4,Swanson Green Tea,Swanson products are of good quality and a good buy. I have had good luck purchasing Swanson products and have liked them all.
4,It's not bad,"Good for those in a rush, but I tend to actually enjoy a nice warm green tea. These pills are a good substitute at a great price."
3,Don't see any difference after few weeks,"I actually don't know if it is working for me or not. After using few weeks, I don't see any difference. May be it is not working for me."
3,Just OK,I did some research before purchasing and thought it would be well worth the cheaper cost. I was a bit let down. I've taken other supplements and this product did not really compare. I didn't really notice any extra energy. I guess the only good thing is that it smells better than other supplements.
5,"Get it, Get it, Get it!",This is a GREAT CD that will stay in your car for months and months! Get it; it is an excellent introduction to a band whose music is easily strong enough to get major airplay in the US.
5,best deal ever,I bought this just for the data cord and for the price its like geting a extra car charger and home charger for free...well worth the money...thank you
3,Wrong home charger,"The disc was missing, and the home charger is a mini, not micro connector! For the price, I got myself a car charger which was still less than at the retail phone store."
3,good charger,This charger works OK.The cost is very low.The quality level of construction does not seem very good.Its OK for a backup charger.
2,Bad News,"This cd is bad, but even worse from a band who hadnt released anything in so long. Rehashed and redone tracks where the originals were just fine. Useless covers. demo track. Cmon.These bands do a few festivals a year for $$ and every band has either reformed with a few original members or never went away. These guys should have a least put their heart and soul into an EP or something, especially after 2 stellar cds in 'Silence' and 'Deception'.Disappointed fan, and if anyone reads this just get the re-issued 'Victims of Deception' cd. Its much better. But I will say the Queen cover of 'Death on Two Legs' is really well done. Great guitar work!"
4,Good stuff to forget about the world,"Fine collection of stories with Hastings narrating all of them. Humorous and far fetched and still diverting enough to finish. A nice way to see Poirot's earlier cases plus one he even failed -(the best story of the bunch.) Compared to her other story collections, this one isn't great, but it's still highly readable. Try her Witness for the Prosecution collection, too and the shorter Jane Marple pieces. They make a well rounded whole. Christie was skilled in many forms of writing (novels, plays, etc, even romance, under another name)"
3,14 cases,The colorful Belgian detective with the waxed mustache and the egg-shaped head uses his little gray cells to solve 14 of his most baffling cases. It is an interesting read; but none of the crimes were proven beyond a reasonable doubt
1,Great Album,This is one of the best swing music collections I have ever listened to. Excellent music and sound reproduction. Very pleasant to spend an evening with.
1,Junk,I never could make it work. I just threw it in the trash can. The tubes of grease that came with the gun was good. This was a lot of money spent for tubes of grease!
4,Good but I didn't get what the picture is,The oil is good oil and works fine. However the picture shows 2 caps on the bottle which was the main reason for my purchase. I wanted the bottle so that I could refill it with bulk oil. The product I recveived only had one cap and is not refillable.
2,You pay for the name here..l,"After I bought this oil, I was told by a Husqvarna technician that any inexpensive SAE30 oil would work just as well at less than half the price. Live and learn."
5,Heather and Moss is uncomparable!,"I bought this in Ireland from Blarney Castle, two bars of soap, the salts and the creme cologne. It was the best thing I brought home. The smell is completely different, not really flowery but a deep green clean smell with just a touch of floral. The guys love it! I've has strangers lean over in elevators to sniff me and comment that I smell great. I have bad allergies to strong perfumes and usually break into sneeing fits but never with this! It's well worth it!"
5,GREAT SCENT,"I originally bought these bath salts in Ireland and love them; I greatly appreciate being able to order them through Amazon. Airfare back to Ireland just wouldn't be cost effective! Amazon's convenience, selection, wish list availability, customer service and reliability is exceptional. You won't be disappointed. One suggestion for Amazon is to indicate the ""Heather and Moss"" scent in the name of the product (i.e., Naturally Irish Heather and Moss Bath Salts-14 oz.)"
4,good hofner copy,"its a good bass for a copy if you cant aford a hofner this is your next best thing for the money,its got good playability its a decent little bass."
4,"Plays Well, Looks Great","When I had gotten it into my head that I wanted a violin-shaped electric bass, I knew I couldn't afford the more expensive Paul McCartney one (I forget which brand he's used), but this bass is awesome! The action is nice and low, the duel pick-ups make for a great range of sound, and the instrument is very light weight (hollow-body). The only drawback is that the neck is so much heavier than the body that if you're strapped on and you let go of the neck, the head falls right to the floor. Other than that, it's a fantastic instrument."
1,Outdated!,"Very outdated ideas and concepts. Did not apply to me as a single pregnant woman. Social views have changed a lot since this book was written. It did however offer good website references, but this can also be found through the website directly without having to buy the book. A better, more with-the-times book on this subject is needed!"
1,Nothing to write home about,"I was expecting more out of it.Specially after the author advertised it on her own website as offering plently of resources .Not really.You still need to do your own search for your state in terms of opportunities and gov support, etc.Nothing that you can't find online for free"
1,The Single Woman's Guide to a Happy Pregnancy,"This book was terrible, it was not at all what I was expecting/ hoping for."
2,Not for Single Women choosing to be a mother,"Great book for women who had not planned to be single and pregnant, but not particularly suitable for those who are to be single mothers by choice. I fall into the latter category and found some useful points, but most of the book was targeted for those not planning to be pregnant and single."
4,"3 Excellent ""Babs"" Films","A very well put together collection. I'm glad Paramount is using the slimmer DVD binders in their multiple collection sets. The sound quality for ""The Mirror Has Two Faces"" and ""The Way We Were"" is excellent. I don't understand why ""The Prince of Tides"" only has 2 channel sound. Picture quality for ""The Prince of Tides"" and ""The Way We Were"" is pretty good. My only real complaint about this set is that ""The Mirror Has Two Faces"" is full screen even though the packaging indicates a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. I already had owned these 3 films seperatly and only got this so I could have MHTF in widescreen. :( Overall,.. I am still happy with my purchase."
3,disappointed,Babs is the greatest but this collection was a disappointment...The packaging was superb but how could Barbara let any collection go out & not be in Widescreen? Any Movie worth watching HAS to be in widescreen..this doesn't even have the option of either/or. I'll be extremely carefully about what I order frome her collection again
4,Good value for money,"Three different Streisand movies about love in one package: sounds like great value and it is, to some extent. If what you're looking for is the movies, then this is great value. This package lacks the extras that we associate with dvds - and this is the major flaw in this collection.The Way We Were - long and at times plodding but characteristic of the romance movies of the 70s; the killer is the final 15 minutes of the film - makes the whole journey almost worthwhile.The Prince of Tides - scrumptuous cinematography; the most 'arty' of Streisand's directorial efforts. Nick Nolte should've won an oscar for his layered and sensitive playing of Tom Wingo.The Mirror Has Two Faces - competent romantic comedy. The gem in the film is Lauren Bacall.Perhaps the package would've made more sense if it included all three of Streisand's directorial efforts so we can witness her range and growth as a director?"
5,Great Box Set,This box set is such fantastic value. I live in Australia but purchased it from Amazon as it was such a great price - even including the postage. I had never seen Prince of Tides or The Way We Were so it was great to receive the box set and have the opportunity to see more Barbra Streisand movies. Both the older movies were such sad and emotional movies so if you enjoy an emotionally charged movie you will love them. Personally I prefer Mirror with Two faces. It has some excellent humour and interesting insight about man and women psychie. Highly recommended.
3,is ok,"I buy this product thinking it was a sugar fruit, but is made out of corn. Is not bad but I rather have regular sugar"
2,Rumpole's lost episode,"As an avid fan of the great barrister and owner of the entire series, I was excited to find another episode not included in the collection. Alas, the unique humor, style, dialogue and overall feel of the Rumpole series was painfully absent in this episode. I can see now why this one was not included in the complete series package and I feel somewhat cheated. However, I am extremely grateful that the remaining 30 or so episodes were entirely different and an absolute treat to view many times over."
3,Where's Pat?,"This episode hardly features Patrick McGoohan as No.6, but some other guy plays him. No. 6's mind is transferred to another man's body, and this other man is a total disappointment. No one can take Patrick McGoohan's place. The Prisoner was Patrick McGoohan's show, and he can't even be in it. The other guy had to play No. 6 while Patrick McGoohan was off doing Ice Station Zebra. If you are a Prisoner fan, you really should watch it, considering there are only 17 episodes to watch. The episode itself isn't bad. It's pretty exciting and you get a feel for No. 6's personal life outside of The Village, but if you're not really interested in The Prisoner but more of just a Patrick McGoohan fan, don't waste your time and money on this episode, BECAUSE HE'S NOT IN IT!"
3,Where IS Pat?,"Many explanations have been offered about this series but you learn to understand it only as you live it. Can the intellect explain it's own existence? You've seen The General - Can it? Regarding this episode - have a care, do not take it lightly. I'll give you a clue: Think Reincarnation. What you know as the world, and the world you know when you leave this one, including your projected ideas of God, evil, etc., are all part of the same thing - Thought known as human consciousness. Beyond this body of thought there is Intelligence. NOW which side are you on?"
3,Not a Critical Read,"This book is entertaining only because it shows different viewpoints. But you won't really learn anything from the book, in terms of real entrepreneurial skills or knowledge. I would say it might be a book to read if you were going to buy 20 others but it certainly is by no means a critical read. It's more like something you would read wihile on a plane.""The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs"" (Stathis) is the best book I have found on the topic. If you want to know absolutely everything about the venture capital industry and how to develo the skills and knowledge that successful high-tech entrepreneurs need, get The Startup Company Bible."
2,People with common sense need not apply,"Although the author and contributors seem to genuinely want to help people avoid pitfalls, some of the ""hard learned lessons"" in here could have been avoided by doing a little research or pausing to consider what they were possibly getting in to. It amazes me that some of these people succeeded; some seem downright clueless. If you are a thoughtful and organized person you can probably skip this one."
3,A few pointers,"I agree with the other book reviewer that said that there are a few good nuggets in this book. I just finished reading this book and I did find a few good pointers. I am taking note of those items so that I can explore them at a later time. However, what I did not like about the book was that it really did not go into detail how these business owners rectified the problem or issues. I think that would be valuable information to add to each person's story. It feels like I have read the first and last chapter of a novel and left wondering, ""Hmmm, what happened to the middle of the story?"" I would prefer less stories but more in-depth ones that what Norman presents."
3,A very interesting book,"When I bought this book I expected to be told a lot and in essence I have but I feel that there is more that the author could have said.On the whole, I like the book. But I'd also like to recommend that readers pick up a copy of Untapped Wealth Discovered written by Jeff N Marquis and Kerry J Harrison.This book is refreshing with fresh ideas and two fresh faced authors. It's amust read especially for women."
2,Pretty basic stuff here,"If you have even the most basic knowledge of business, don't expect to find anything new here. Could be good for a high school dropout and only the most naive to business."
4,real advice,I have not had the opportunity to finish reading this book but look forward to learning about how to lauch my new career. This is informative and easy to understand.
4,Good book,"I have read through this book a number of times and it has a lot of good information broken down into digestable chunks.If you are looking for pitfalls, then read it."
4,"Good info, but no meat","This book has some good information about starting a small business, things you might not think of being on your own. They don't delve a lot into the nuts and bolts of how to get a lot of the information though. A lot of the people said seek out a prarticular thing, but no info on where to find it.I gave it 4 stars because it really does have a LOT of ""ah-ha!"" 's."
2,Ultra-Novice Advice for Entrepreneurial Newbies,"If you know nothing about business and feel you must throw good money after bad by starting your own business then by all means buy this book. It's like my advising you to, ""look both ways before crossing the street."" Sound advice for a five year old and reundtantly annoying for those older. In terms of writing the book lacks heart and is anyting but compelling reading."
3,A Good Book if You are a Budding Teenage Entrepreneur,"Among the numerous books for starting your own business out in the marketplace, this one is pretty good for the right audience; that is, those who do not know the first thing about starting a business. While there is certainly a need for such books, I did not find it useful for me though. This book might make it onto the reading list for a high school business class, but beyond that I cannot see much value. But still, there are worse introductory books for entrepreneurs than this one. I'm still trying to find one that really delivers."
4,Not really a textbook to small business...,"I think many people who purchased this book were thinking this might be a one-stop shop for business advice. Although there's much to be learned from the small businesses featured in ""What No One Ever Tells You About Starting Your Own Business,"" it hardly works as a textbook-type book.However, if you're throwing around some ideas for a potential, you're bound to get your creative juices flowing by reading about the highs and lows of those who took the gamble before you. It's bound to spark some ideas. In that respect, I rate this book very highly.The book does offer solutions for the problems these companies faced, but it most circumstances, it's hard to apply the information to your specific situation.If you've already started your own business, this book probably isn't for you. However, if you're looking for an idea or hoping to shape one, you're bound to get some value for your money."
3,I was dissappointed,"Judging by the raving reviews for this book, I was expecting something spectacular. I came away feeling that I was cheated.While the book is not bad, it is not worthy of the raving 5 star reviews and acclaim that it has recieved. I can only think that the reviews were shills or people who are terribly naive to business.Not bad...but not great. Definitely not 5 star material."
3,There are a few nuggets of information in here,"I agree with the other reviewers who said this book is pretty basic. However, there are a few nuggets of information, if you search for them.Not the best book on business. I would recommend that you borrow it from a library or get it from a used book store."
4,Brilliant!,"A must have for all translators! A very good, practical book. Great reference for all translators out there.Although I have to admit it, at some points it goes way too theoretical to the point of boring numbness, which makes me rate it 4 stars.But all in all, a brilliant book."
2,Not a great book,I have many scrapbooking books and this one is just not up to par. You can find simpler designs elsewhere plus there's nothing new in this book you haven't seen before.
2,A disappointment,"I was very disappointed when I read this book. Usually, I like Jayne Ann Krentz's books very much, but I constantly wanted to yell at Emily not to be such a wimp. She had just managed to stand up to her family and then she let herself be ordered around by her lover! And of course this Jacob wasn't one of my favorite characters either. I think bossy men are horrible and not even heroines in romances should fall in love with them."
2,Clearly an early work,"I agree with ""Reader from the Midwest"" that Emily is a wimpy, spineless disappointment, and Jacob is obnoxious and overbearing, like Emily's whole family. This is clearly an early work re-issued, before Ms. Krentz hit her stride with strong, well-rounded women and men who are strong without being dictatorial, domineering, or controlling. Don't give up on Krentz if this is the only one you've read, just stick to those written in the 1990's (or later). I've found the re-issues of the 1980's works of popular writers such as Krentz and Linda Howard to be almost uniformly disappointing. They often have the old romance formula of controlling, unable-to-express-love, know-it-all man and feisty (but not too much!) woman, who ultimately submits to most of his demands because he ""loves"" her. Who needs that kind of love? Anyway, try Jayne Ann Krentz again in her modern incarnation and don't waste money on these re-issues..."
4,"Jane did a great job,...as always!",I really thought that this was a great book. I can always count on Jane to give me a fiesty heroine. I continually look forward to reading her books (under all of her pseudonyms).
4,love through all times,"Jacob stone has benn in love with emily for 5 years, but he was married. then her family call him to ask him to look after her. Sparks are bound to fly and they do. Krentz, once again proves that she is the master (mistress) of romance novels"
5,Brilliant coverage of contemporary research on human evolution,"Carl Zimmer is a rarity: a science writer who thoroughly understands his subject and can interpret complex science in a way that laypeople can readily grasp.This overview of contemporary knowledge of human origins is beautiful in every respect. Zimmer's writing is wonderfully smooth. Even the most complex subjects are rendered simple, but not in a condescending manner. The book is richly and profusely illustrated. The overall design lends itself to easy reading.If you want to know where today's scientists think we humans came from, this single volume will tell you.Jerry"
4,Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Huma Origins,"Zimmer, as usual, did a fine job in picking and presenting the current thoughts on how we humans came to be. While I have read a number of books in this general field, Intimate Guide pulls up many fine details that clear up some confusion between theories and make for a great read. It is especially helpful in understanding how hominids originally populated the world and how we fit into the picture.The excellent photos and illustrations are helpful and compliment the text very well. A very good choice for anyone who wonders where we came from."
5,This Book is a great place to start learning about human origins,"Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human OriginsWell written easy to understand, wonderful pictures and graffics. This book is a great place to start learning about human origins. If you have a background on the subject the book also provides valued in depth information on genetics as it relates to tracing our orgins. Great Pictures and well illustrated."
5,Human origins,"This is a wonderful overview of human development and prehistory. It is very readable and interesting. When I finished the book, I felt that I had a much better sense of the origins and development of homo sapiens."
4,A Good Place to Start,"Solid presentation. Easy read, great illustrations. Provides a good overview. It is not overly technical which relegates it to those who are ""beginners"" or maybe some ""intermediates"" in the studying of human evolution. I do recommend it to be part of your science bookshelf.Cheers."
5,Intelligent & well written,"Kingdom of Make-Believe refers to the Thailand that people see and what is behind it. The author also has one of his characters mention a Kingdom of Make-Believe at her school where she allows the children to act out their fantasies. This is used very well at the end. This is obviously a very well thought out novel in which a New York editor receives a mysterious letter from his brother's widow (a woman he was once in love with) and that, plus business, sends him back to Thailand after 20 years. And things begin to happen: love, danger and lots of people with secrets to hide. A fine read."
5,Fantasic,Excellent imagery of Thailand combined with an in depth knowlege of the topic area make this an awesome read for anyone interested in Thailand. Great realism of characters and accurate portrayals of the bar scene in Bangkok. A great read.
4,Kingdom of Make-Believe: A Novel of Thailand,"Bored,lonely,horny? Visit Bangkok, but before you go you've got to read one of Dean Barrett's novels on the Land of Smiles. Bangkok is a smorgasbord of earthly pleasures that come to life through the pen of Dean Barrett. Always a great read."
5,Accurate and well drawn Portrait of Thailand,"""In the fleeting moments of twilight they sat mesmerized with the crumbling remains of the abandoned temple and glimpsed the still-living soul of the kingdom."" The author's descriptions of Ayudhya are really fine and sensitive. The plot of this book is also interesting. I bought the book in Bookazine in Bangkok and it made great reading on the plane back to the States. This is a kind of love story and mystery and murder set against the background of Thailand about a decade ago. It's the kind of book you don't want to end."
1,Is This the Same Book I Read?,"I had to do a double-take at the cover to believe that the rave reviews here on Amaxon were in fact talking about the same horrible dribble I had read upon my return from a wonderful month in Thailand. This book was impossible to trudge through, and worse yet, the story itself was hard to swallow. By the end, not only had I lost all respect for the main character and wished I had left this book back in Thailand, but wished I hadn't spent the full cover price they were charging in Bangkok. A far better read is Traveler's Tales which is worth every penny and then some."
5,Hooray!,"Great book! I personally found it refreshing and insightful, and have enthusiastically recommended it to my students. Two thumbs up!"
3,Great Grandma doll!,"I would recommend this little doll to any child who is over the age of putting things in their mouth. It is sturdy, well made, bendable (an important feature to help the doll sit down!), and a great price."
3,Decent Startup,"Swanson provides a fair product, and this is no exception. I wasn't incredibly blown away, but I did feel a slight boost in energy. A B Vitamin complex and maybe a multi vitamin over a couple weeks would probably do you worlds better."
5,Better than hook and loop,This pad is the only way to go for an every day use orbital sander. Sticky back discs are less than half the cost of hook and loop and the pad lasts literally 10 times longer.
2,Not one of Fischer's better efforts,"Very disappointing. Not a single character that is anything other than the thinnest cardboard. So when you get to the end, you don't really care who committed the murders or who got murdered. Fischer was capable of a lot better than this one. After reading this, I had to grab a John D. MacDonald so that I would be sure of getting something that was well written to get the bad taste of this one out of my mouth."
4,"Good, but no hood! :O","Jacket is great (!!) - very warm & holds well against freezing wind. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the product claimed there was a detachable hood, but there is none!! Not even a pocket for it. Oh well, still a great deal and a nicely made jacket. I've only had it for a couple of days, but it seems pretty durable. I'm pleased!"
5,bite golf shoe,"great shoe for golf or hiking,the price was outstanding.bought another pair after i saw the quality."
4,Lucky find of a shoe that fits,I was fortunate to find this pair of shoes as the product has been discontinued. The seller shipped them on time and they are as described so I am a very happy customer.
2,"TOO MUCH ""Bite"" for Disc Golf","These shoes WRECKED my back, they have such good traction and ""bite"" on the turf it's like standing in a bucket of dried cement. Your feet need to turn a LITTLE BIT as you run up and throw your disc. All the torque, power and TWIST from your upper body goes straight to your lower back when you release the disc! It only took me 36 holes to finally determine this, but two weeks of epson salts and ibuprophen later my back STILL hurts! You want shoes that grip? Better be careful what you wish for...these shoes grip TOO much for disc golf! I might wear them the next time I'm climbing up Pikes Peak, however...I'd hate to slip and injure myself!!!"
5,Awesome read,Once again an Eckert novel delivers. Definitely fills in the information NOT covered in fourth grade state history class. Blue Jacket is next!
4,A graphic view of life for settlers of the new frontier and the native Americans who were there first.,"The author gave a realistic story line of the struggle between the whites and the Native American Indians in the settling of the Western Territtories.Good historical reference to the vast Indian Nation and their interaction and conflict with these whitemen who would ultimately take their land and move them further West.Too many details to reference here, but intimately part of a well told history.Can't wait to read the next 3 parts of the series."
5,Frontiersmen,"Move over Danial Boone. This book exceeds the criteria to qualify as an exceptional book -- by far the most accurate account of what life was like on the frontier. Exhaustive research to support some of the most brutal and savage accounts in history make it a write I couldn't put down. Indeed, I have read the book thrice and used it countless times for reference. However, I suggest it is not a book for those under 13. Some of the accounts are so brutally shocking and graphic, I actually had trouble sleeping one night. Still, it is not without humor. After a stand-off between Tehcumsa and Kenton, both muskets misfired and the warriors stood frozen wondering what to do next. In another account, Simon Kenton nearly killed a man in a frontier pub who would one day become president -- Andrew Jackson! Weighing Jackson's subsequent presidential victory and the horror of the Trail of Tears to answer for, I found myself wishing Kenton had done the deed. This is a must read."
5,The one book of a lifetime!(just kidding though it's close.),This book will knock you off of your feet. It is one of the best living history books you will ever find. To discover the TRUE history of westward expansion read this book. Revisionists take heed... this book reeks of truth
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book due to the positive customer reviews and the interesting subject matter. Disappointed in both the story and the writing. The author jumps back and forth in time, which is hard to do in a book. It also seemed to depict less interesting points to discuss."
3,The Frontiersman,An excelent book on the early years of America detailing the lives of the early settlers and their tribulations.
2,The Frontersmen,"Liked it at the beginning, towards the middle I began to question the author's percieved perception of the hero as a man of greatness.I began to view him as nothing but a land grabbing cruel man without any morals only the destruction of a way of life and the indian people.He fought to protect the settlers to increase the value of his holdings I was pleased to see that these same people that he fought to protect actually stole the stolen land from him.I actually stopped reading the book which is something I am loathe to do but as it rolled on and on it became a horror storyThe book is too long and the subject is truly not a hero deserving of statues"
5,frontiersman,I have over the years probably purchased and given as gifts 7-8 copys of this book!It is the best narrative on the market bar none.All of Ekert's book are a great read you cannot go wrong either buying one for yourself of as a gift.Try one and see!I have read all his books they all are great!He has a proven track record bar none.maxhoss
5,"The Best, Most Engaging American History Book","Except for the Holy Bible, THE FRONTIERSMEN, by Allan W. Eckert, is the best book I have ever read! A few years ago, I had the high privilege of telling Allan Eckert that in person."
4,The Frontiersmen,"I'm from ohio and I learned a lot of historical info for the first time. Settlers taking up new residence in the northwest territory, Ohio and Kentucky, paid a huge price in both lost lives and personal sacrifice."
5,Best book of non fiction,It is amazing that Simon Kenton was a real man. His exploits are astonishing. Allan Eckert did a tremendous job of bringing this story to life. It is much more than a story of a man. It is the story of America's westward expansion.
5,Good read,This author tells an amazing story of the clash of cultures during the white man's push into Kentucky and Ohio. Fascinating reading.
5,A Great Book!!!!,"This book has delivered everything that I expected from it. It is historically accurate, exciting and has me looking forward to turning to the next page to see what is about to happen. I am looking forward to continuing to read the remainder of the books in this great American series. Thank you to Allan Eckert for such doing such great research and writing."
5,The best book I ever read,"The above says it all. People think Im strange when I talk about Ohio and history, but this book explains it all!"
5,The Ultimate Pop Record Research Book!,Having owned many of Joel Whitburn`s research books I was really looking forward to this one. The first Top Pop Update since 1992 is more than expected. A lot of new features such as highlighted most popular song at a glance and listing the original B sides as well as mixing in Christmas recordings of each artist and showing dollar value of all entries make this even more useable than previous volumes. More pictures and bio information is also very nice. This book comes in a very nicely hard bound over 900 page format. It was expensive but has a wealth of information that you wont find anywhere else in such an organized and easy to cross reference format. If you collect records and are interested in chart history you MUST have this book.
1,A Huge Disappointment,"Although the product description says the DVDs total over 600 minutes, you basically get less than 2 minutes (no joke less than 120 SECONDS) of footage of each theme looped over and over and over. For the scenic one you get under two minutes of some beautiful images, but then they repeat. What doesn't repeat is the music and they offer jazz, classical, etc., so that's how they're getting away with the 600 minute claim. The music just continues on and on over the same old images. I feel completely duped. What a waste of money. I bought the DVDs hoping for at least an hour of footage over which I could play my own music, and after 15 minutes of repeats I'm already bored with it. Also, half the ocean images are faded and the other half look like they were shot in a fish tank. Save your money."
5,Barbie Fashion book review-1959-1967,Great book - a must for any Barbie collector-great pictures with accessories that originally went with each outfit- easy to look up values-great fun to wander through!!
5,Highly Recomend for the Barbie Collector,"This book has so much information. I was able to put accessories and outfits together from a bundle of Barbie ""stuff"". If you are looking for a book to inform you on original Barbie clothes this is the one."
2,Not as helpful as I hoped,"As a new collector I thought this book would be a useful tool in recognizing valuable dolls. However,that hasn't been the case.With dolls and even more so, doll clothing,there has to be some photos (or at least descriptions) for you to know what you are looking at. I have found that the prices are not accurate with the actual market value of the dolls either. For the price that I paid for this book there are much better book options avalible. I think that club sites on the internet actually provide you with more info than this book. And they are free."
1,Slapshot 2 needs penalty time,"This is the worst sequel ever... The hanson brothers, the reason I bought the DVD, are barely in it and to make it worse it isn't even funny... although that should be obvious when you see Stephen Baldwin is in it. In other words, don't bother with this movie... save the [money] and buy the 25th anniversary of the original Slap Shot... much better film."
1,Very disappointing!,"Not even the Hanson Brothers could make this movie funny. I waited a long time for this movie but was very, very disappointed. Too bad."
2,A bad attempt,I waited with excitement when it was announced that Slap Shot 2 was coming out.Being a huge hockey fan and a huge fan of the first movie i went out the first day to buy this.The first movie is an all time classic and the latest attempt is an all time dud. The acting was horrible and the movie was extremely cheesey. Completely predictable..In the behind the scenes section of the DVD the director said he turned down 3-4 scripts and picked this script. Bad choice!!!!Save your money for something better.
1,dont waist your time,this movie is horrible. I give it o stars IT MADE ME SELECT ONE THOUGH this in no way is like th original slapshot. one word somes up POOPY
3,Slap Shot 2...whew...,"Well, this movie had TV movie level acting and storyline. But that doesn't take away from the quality of the film. The image is crisp and free of artifacts. Many shots are a little dark, but purposely filmed to give the atmosphere of ""creepy"".You can tell they set out to do something, but somewhere it just fell apart.The special features are too limited. What would help this film is tons of extras. This way the price is more attractive.Rent it and laugh."
1,A true stinker!,I bought this when it first came out. It is no more as it has gone thru my CD/DVD shredder. It is that bad and I needed the keepcase that it came in. It's kind of like something you recorded on your old top-load VCR 20 years ago and you now wonder why you wasted the tape space? Do yourself a favor and pass on this sequel but DO buy the original! It deserves 10 stars for exactly what it is: 1970's minor league hockey.
2,"""What a f---ing nightmare.""","Rent this video, don't buy it, then fast forward to the Hanson's scenes and the final hockey game. Skip the rest unless you feel you must witness ""this fiasco"".Most of this movie is just plain awful except for the scenes with the Hansons and the Chief's new goalie who has this ""obsessive compulsive"" thing going (like most goalies, eh). He was pretty funny.There were way too many attempts to rehash the great gags from the original Slapshot, it actually got painful to watch. The writers should have to go sit in the penalty box for this slashing they gave us.Excuse me while I go watch the original a few times to get this bad experience out of my head, eh."
1,Absolutely terrible.,"We should be able to select ""No star"" for the rating. Just sad, horrible attempt at a sequel. Hockey people will understand my opinion. The original was and is still the all time greatest hockey movie ever. I can't believe they even released this film."
1,Simply Awful,"I love hockey. I love hockey movies. I'll watch commercials if they have hockey in them. THIS was horrible. I know, if it has a Baldwin other than Alec, it probably stinks, but I got suckered in simply because its about a sport I love. This was a travesty. The hacks that made it should be on the other end of Bob Probert's swingin' fists."
1,What is this ?,"MAn, no wonder why they didn't put this in the Cinemas. What a poor movie.. Nothing like the first. No tye ins to the the first. Rent this movie only do not buy you will be unhappy in looking for a classic sequel"
1,"Watch the first one,,forget this one","The first clue to avoid this, is it went right to video. Most of the funny lines were rehashed from the first one. Even at that it was a stretch for a laugh.The Gordie Howe Elbow line was funny,,the first and second time,,but wore old after awhile. I should point out,,I'm old enough to have seen Gordie and the Hanson/Carlson Brothers play in the WHA.I wish I could say more about the story line,,but it's a very weak one. I've seen student films more entertaining than this was.If you're a big hockey fan,,I would think you would want to avoid this movie."
5,Better than the original!,"I thought the first slap shot was too predictible, i knew it was his wife and i knew that guy was hitting that other guy! This is probably the greatest movie of all time, not including Baby's Day Out and Space Cowboys. Mr. Baldwin is the greatest actor ever, not including Martin Short. Instead of Slap Shot it should be called Slap Stick! Cause that's what it is! It's a hoot and a holler!! Go and buy this movie immediately! I also reccommed Cabin Boy and the first season of Rossanne! ITS A MASTERPIECE!!!!!"
3,Travellar,"I've listend to this album for a month now....Was a fan of Tyketto , and must admit that in my opion , Mr. Vaughn has not made an album that even comes close to his Tyketto days. Got them all , Flesh and Blood , Vaughn , From the inside.... What is it that makes Tyketto so much better ? When Tyketto made an album whitout Vaugh , it was the same thing...Didn't work.....Hope these guy's reunite.....3 Stars for this one. Which I think is Mr. Vaughn's best since Tyketto."
2,"""Do not kill, Do not take life""","What I most took away from this autobiography was confusion. How did the ""movement"" incorporate and become synonomous with abortion? Mrs. Sanger, at least in this piece that she wrote, was outspokenly anti-abortion. Yet, her brainchild- Planned Parenthood- is the largest national provider of abortions today. I took from this book that Mrs. Sanger was a bit naive and surrounded herself with some sinister circles. Circles that saw the profit that could be made through abortion. Sufficing their desires for population control and greed. Mrs. Sanger helped in the opening of a Pandora's box of eugenics and moral relativeness. Did she really mean what she wrote- ""Do not kill, do not take life, but prevent""?"
1,a continued killer of many,"Margaret Sanger was no better than Hitler with her population control. She chose to focus on control because she was one of many children from her family and obviously did not get enough attention. Now she focuses on being selfish. Most of us have children because we love them. For those who have abortions, they need to stay out of other peoples beds if they can't handle the responsibility or the unselfishness of having a child or children."
3,It Leaks,I have had mine for about 6 months and use it on a daily basis. Was great until today.It leaks from the sealed cap but I can't figure why. There are no cracks in it. I am going to contact Thermos to see if they will replace it.
3,Hard to get good cards,I didn't get any Lebron rookie cards. Got a lot of minor stars. Wouldn't really recommend.
2,Product didn't last very long,"I bought the Sangean ATS-404 for my wife for Christmas 2004. I found the sound output rather amazing for such a small package. AM reception wasn't great but adequate. FM was fine. SW left much to be desired. My wife was born and raised in Africa and I bought this radio with the idea she might pickup stations from South Africa or Kenya. We could get very few stations at all and none from Africa.And the worst has been after less than six months use I found the radio sitting in a pool of ""radio blood"" this morning. I suppose some large capacitor inside leaked (no, it wasn't batteries). So now it doesn't work. Seems like a lot of money to spend on what is essentially a small FM transistor radio.If you have to buy Sangean, better spend some extra money on a service policy. Better yet, buy anything but Sangean."
1,A big disappointment,"I would have given this 0 stars but that didn't appear to be an option on the Amazon.com form. After seeking through the entire SW band three different times, at different times of the day and night, all I got was BBC, and that only once, and some religious broadcasts. I would have been very happy to get stations from just Canada and Mexico, but no such luck. It's a very nice AM/FM radio with some spiffy features like a sleep timer, but my hope was to receive international broadcasts, and I am returning it because it simply did not do that."
4,Sangean Shortwave Bought at Verizon.,"It's okay, and I will use it quite a bit. Reception is better at night on both bands. It's easy to use, and adequate for my needs."
3,Nice little radio,"This is a good little radio: good reception, good tone, good controls. Its only weak point is its size, though, too big for a beach robe pocket, too small to stand up on its own on a beach towel. but otherwise, I'm as happy as a clam in the off-season with it."
3,a basic radio,"This is a basic am/fm clock radio if that's what you need, it looks nice sounds nice, and works however if you need single sideband you need to look at the ATS 909."
3,For this price you can't beat it!,This is the lowest price I've seen for this radio anywhere! Its great for a 'first' short wave radio!
1,What a disappointment!,"Having heard Sam Harris' rendition of ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"" on his Standard Time album while watching Chicago's Hubbard Street dance group, I was excited to discover such a wonderful talent.What a profound disappointment this album was. It's a cross between early Barbara Streisand and the Village People. Save your money!"
4,A Nice Introduction To Sam,"I have Sam's first 2 releases on vinyl(Sam Harris & Sam I Am) and I just love them. I was excited to see some of the songs were reissued in this compililation. If you are a fan of Sam, this is a great starter CD. He has such energy and vocal talent. The reason why I did not give this CD 5 stars is because I am spoiled. There are so many great songs on the vinyl records that are not included on this complilation. One to note is: ""Sugar Don't Bite"". It would have been great if they would have reissued both records so all the songs could be enjoyed! I also recommend ""Revival"", Sam's new CD. It is AWESOME."
2,Where are the hits?,"Who would put an artist collection together and omit that artist's best selling hits? Well, apparently Motown did and they sure messed up this compilation, much like RCA did with their label's Diana Ross collection - another poor excuse for a collection. What happened to ""Sugar Don't Bite"" and his tremendous cover of ""You Keep Me Hangin' On"" as well as other great LP tracks? For those of us who wanted Sam Harris' Motown records on CD, this one is sure a major disappointment. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because it has got ""Over The Rainbow."" Come on, Motown, you could have done better than this thrown together collection. Record companies forget that compact disc buyers want the HITS when they make a purchase of greatest hits and best of collections."
3,Very good c.d. powerful. Sam is unlike anyone around.,Sam is a very powerful singer. He is right on the money when it comes time to belt out a number to get under your skin and give you goose bumps.
4,Works well,"Bought this dethatcher a few weeks ago. The box was partially opened when it arrived so I was a little concerned, but no parts were missing. It took about 20-30 minutes to assemble, and the instructions were good. Make sure you adjust the dethatcher as described in the instruction book - so that both sets of tines are in contact with the grass. I used this on my half-acre lot and it worked great. You do need to purchase 2 thin cement blocks to weigh it down. It brought up a lot of thatch - more than I expected - without tearing up the lawn. I then used the tractor in blow the thatch into piles so it was easier to rake up. Seems to be a well-built unit that will last for years."
3,"Not bad, but pain to build","Bought this and spent a considerable amount of time putting it together. The design is not the best as the tines frequently come unseated while dethatching. Caution, if your soil is dry, this will tear up the top surface alltogether leaving large bare spots. Would be nice if the depth of the tines were adjustable."
4,economical thatching solution,does the job. what you get is sturdy enough but the lever handle needs some work or the thing collapses back on itself.
5,Vital for every heart,"In this gift book edition, The Father's Love Letter has even more power and impact. A great gift for friends and family."
5,Fascinating! A must-read book,"For anyone even mildly interested in Bigfoot -- whether believer, skeptic, or on the fence -- Rife's book provides an intriguing and thoroughly engrossing look at accounts of Bigfoot encounters. It's fascinating to see how people react differently to the incidents -- some immediately run away, others are frozen, and a few actually run toward the creatures!I never realized how widespread Bigfoot encounters are. Rife provides accounts from 48 states (only Rhode Island and Hawaii have no tales) and recounts them through well-written narrative as well as direct quotes from the witnesses. Whatever your opinion about Bigfoot, these accounts will surely leave you with a tingle down your spine."
3,Great TV but watch out for defective power supplies,"The TV picture and sound quality are all excellent as the other reviews describe. However, some of these TVs were manufactured with defective power supplies (see http://stafford.typepad.com/the_next_america/2004/02/panasonic_plasm.html) that cause a ""blinking red power light of death"" and the TV won't power on anymore. I was lucky mine failed after just 3 months so it was still under warranty. Panasonic arranged for a local repair shop to repair it, but we were without a TV for 3 days before the warranty repair service appointment. The repair (replacing the power supply circuit pack) took 20 minutes and the TV is fine now.It's a fantastic TV, but beware the faulty power supply."
1,Common Flashing problem,See the comments by others with one star review. We had the same problem about two months after the purchase. This should be recalled.
2,BLINKING LIGHTS OF DEATH,"I bought TH-42PZ700U in 2008. Got the ""Seven Blinking Lights of Death"" in August 2011. The TV was fabulous while it lasted. . . but did not last nearly as long as it should have for the cost. The picture was great, but my favorite part was the side firing speakers that no one seems to do anymore. They all want to sell you surround systems to make up for the poorly designed bottom speakers found in most sets today. Now onto the dillema of repair or replace. . ."
1,Good While It Lasted Was Right on the Money,"This was an awesome TV while it lasted. Unfortunately, the awesomeness was less was 2 years. Now the Panel Control Board is out which will be $500 to fix. Obviously, it makes more sense to buy a new set. Our old school Mitsubishi has held up 100 percent better. 12 years in service and only two repairs totaling less than $800. 2 years, pathetic Panasonic!"
1,Mine died...twice,"On a lot of message boards you will see people saying that approximately 2% of Panasonic plasmas built in the timeframe this one was manufactured have fatal flaws. Take a look for yourself, though. Ever seen a consumer product with so many people complaining about it dying on them? I bought mine in December of 2007 and certainly wasn't disappointed with the picture or sound quality. Too bad Panasonic put some very defective pieces into their power board. Mine first died in September of 2009 but (luckily) was still under extended warranty under my AMEX card. An authorized Panasonic service company replaced the P-Board ($650), and less than five months later the tv is once again dead -- the 10 blinking lights of death. No way would I pay out of my own pocket to get it fixed again. What's the over/under on it dying again in just a few months? I'll never buy a Panasonic again..."
5,"Excellent TV, Thanks to all of the other reviewers!",I felt obligated to write a review of this TV since I had read almost every review I could find on the internet. My final decision was between this and a Samsung LNT4065F. The Samsung may be a fine TV but this TV is absolutely amazing. My regular programming is basic cable at 480i which looks great. This TV really shines though when hooked up with my Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player. I also just received a mac mini for Christmas. I hooked it up with a dvi/hdmi conversion cable which displays the desktop at 1900x1080. HD Movie trailers downloaded from Apple look stunning.I would easily buy this TV again if I had the choice to do so.
5,Excellent product,Haven't been disappointed. Excellent picture and great price and delivery from Amazon. Get the HDMI cable for better picture. You don't need to spend more than $20 for it...digital is digital.
2,talleyscot,"Long story short - within one month of purchase the entire picture went out, repaired after a 10 days (Concierge service was great but right before Thanksgiving), after another month a whole line of pixels went out leaving a thin line through the center of the screen, repairman replaced a ""board"" (the second time), TV worked briefly and now I have no picture at all again. The Superbowl is in 2 days. Guess how happy I am with Panasonic. The picture and features are great when it's working."
5,"Beautiful Picture, Fantastic Sound","This was my first HDTV, so I went through a lot of research before I chose the TH-42PZ700U. Every review, both from customers and professional reviewers, all agreed that this television offers the best picture possible in the 42"" HDTV market. Now that I have it in the house I couldn't agree more. The colors and picture quality is outstanding. Standard definition (480i) channels look great and HD (1080i) channels must be seen to be believed. The built-in sound is the icing on the cake. They're far beyond anything I've experienced with standard television speakers.The only negative that I can find is that it does generate a considerable amount of heat, but this is par for the course with plasma TV's. The difference in color quality and viewing angles in plasma over LCD makes this a very minor issue.All I can say is do yourself a favor and buy this TV. You won't regret it."
1,good while it lasts,though one pixel did die on my set about a year ago the picture quality is amazing...while it lasts. i just had it turn off on me after almost two years and now i find that it won't turn back on unless i spend 300 dollars to repair it.
1,Model has power source issues,"Jan 09 update: Fortunately Panasonic granted me a concession for the repairs and I am waiting for the set to be returned. Parts for the repair (new panel and SD box) would have been over $1400.I purchased this plasma in Nov 2007 after reading reviews here and on Consumer Reports. Two days ago, and one week after the warranty expired, the TV just went off. As another reviewer noted, the on/off light flashes 7 times. Called Panasonic and of course their reps treated this as an 'unusual problem.' If you do buy this model, elect for extended warranty. The bargain basement price isn't really so good when you're looking at spending several hundred dollars to replace parts one year + one week later."
2,Reliability Issues,"I have had this unit for 4 months now. All of a sudden, no picture, no sound. 7 flashes from the power indicator LED - that's it. Panasonic has scheduled a repair technician, but a month wait for the backordered part? Others have described a faulty power supply unit. I can't help but wonder if it takes a month to get the part - what arre they using to build the current TV's? I would really look around for another brand knowing what I know now. Sure the picture is nice, but NO picture? Tought to recommend based on my experience so far."
5,greatest tv i have every seen,"i looked every where for hdtv's and happened upon this tv on the internet i studied every thing about this unit and found it to be the best buy for my money.when it came i installed it and to my surprise it had the most wonderful color and clarity of any tv i have every seen, it is a 1080p which has not come out yet but i run it on 1080i format and it's great.you will find it hard to stop watching tv, i connected it behind a direct tv hddvr recorder and the picture is so great. you can't go wrong with this tv."
5,Buy this one.,"First we bought a Samsung that blew up after a week. Samsung service was horrendous, but Amazon was great, they took it back, alleviating my fears of online TV orders. We paid $400 more for the Panasonic and can't believe how much nicer the picture is. All plasmas are not equal, if you want plasma, spend the money and get this Panasonic. The Samsung didn't look any better than are old set."
5,Classic First-Person Shooter,"This was the very first first-person shooter game I ever played. Needless to say, it was by far the best first-person shooter I ever played. Of course they've come out with far better games since...but for the time when this game came out...it was by far the best.Don't bother playing Half-Life 2 until you've played this one first! And don't cheat, it's infinitely more fun to figure it out!"
1,Do not waste your money!,"By no means am I rating the game. The game is a masterpiece: 10/10! I ordered this online and it was $75.00. Now I see it has risen to over $90.00 in just two weeks! Absurd! Well, I ordered it and it arrived on time. I installed it on my computer and it brought up a message saying how my computer did not have enough memory. I have invested thousands of dollars into my computer, and it is more powerful than most. Stupid me could have bought the game for $9.99 on my Steam account, and that is what I ended up doing. You can probably buy this game for that price on Amazon or elsewhere. And the $9.99 version works great on my computer. All I have to say is that I will never buy from this seller again as it was a complete ripoff!"
4,Great Overview,"I used this Thin Book as a way to get a better understanding of the dynamics of AI. While there is not a lot of detail, that's the whole point of the Thin series--just the germ of the idea with a few examples.I particularly liked the question sets and the examples of AI in use. The comparison of AI with regular problem solving methods was particularly enlightening."
3,Thin is right,"There isn't anything in this small guide that you can't find easily online. I'm sure when it was first published it was a valuable resource as an introduction to a larger subject. Read what you can find online and if you are interested in more depth, buy a ""fatter"" book."
3,A good read,I think that AI gives an interesting view of the change process. This book concisely outlines these ideas.
1,Print Problems,"We ordered this book in August, but didn't get around to reading it until December. There must have been problems at the printer, because many pages are missing and others are out of order. We unscrambled as best we could, but the missing pages are a big disappointment. Otherwise, what we could read, was excellent. (We missed the 30 day return window.)"
