5,Undiscovered Gem,"I just watched this movie last night. Awesome! I don't know how I never heard of this movie before, but it's a must watch."
2,Did anybody who did a review on this movie actuallt watch it!!,"The best part of this movie is the trailer. This is clearly a B rated movie with a bunch of B rated actors. The movie is slow moving and the guy who narrates the entire movie, his voice and tone are annoying. I am actually mad i bought this movie."
1,"If you don't believe in your own experiences, this is the book for you.","This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It deserves 0 stars. It is completely choppy and annoying. The author would serve the public better by just setting up his website as a gigantic book review. Clearly the author has a point of view but seems incapable of articulating it in his own words. What makes the book so tedious is the constant stream of quotes from others. There is no cohesive body of thought or experience in this book. You are just jostled from one quotation to another. If you need to prop up your ego with what other ""thinkers"" say in order to defend your reality system, then this is the book for you."
1,Wanted to love it - he needs an editor,"I purchased this book because I enjoy JJ Harper's interviews on Coast2Coast and the internet. I wanted to learn more about shamanism, ETs and indigenous wisdom as he's very informed on the subjects during his interviews. He is also genuinely concerned about where our civilization and planet is headed if we don't change our consciousness and actions.That being said, I couldn't get through the preface. It's a poorly written book and lacks basic grammar and punctuation editing. I'm perplexed by the many intelligent and well-written reviews of this book and only a few mention the lack of editing and poor content organization. I'm also disappointed that a publisher would print this book as it's currently written.Like some of the other reviewers recommended, please try other authors such as Terence McKenna and James Gilliland. If you want just shamanism, stick with Harner, Wesselman and Cowan."
5,A great book by John Jay Harper,"John has written one of the major books of the century. The profound nature and science of this work is something we should all listen to and attempt to take on board - for in the folds of this beautifully woven tapestry there hides a new wisdom for our age.Not only does this book answer some of the most incredible questions mankind has asked for a very long time, such as is there life after death? It also begs the question, can we make a difference today to our own lives, those around us and even the very universe itself in ways more amazing than any trickery of the magician or manipulation of the church.If you enjoyed What The Bleep, then you have to buy this book."
5,reaction to Tranceformers,"I could hardly put this book down. The author has done a superb job of combining shamanic tradition and practices and modern science--cutting edge science of consciousness. His research is very extensive. His is one of the first books that I have founnd that also validated my own almost near death experience that was not the standard type. I really cannot say enough about this book, you simply need to read it!"
2,"Good topic, poor writing style","I am a longtime student and practitioner of the type of material covered in this book. While the author does highlight some good nuggets of information pulled from the research of other people, in general I found it to be way too disjointed. It seemed like every page had several references to other works and this constant referencing really distracted from the points the author was trying to make. Also, for me personally, there were far too many things presented as ""truth"" and not enough encouragement of the reader to think and investigate for themselves. If you do get this book, get it as a reference compilation on topics like: enlightenment, shamanism, ancient cultures (mayan, egyptian), and near death experiences. Its best use for me would have been to skim through and see if any of the topics were of interest and then go off and get the source works the author refers to. I do not recommend reading it cover to cover."
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I put this book down for good about 3/4 of the way through. Most of the information is quotes, references to other authors' work, or NDE narrative. While this is interesting, it seems to me that the only contribution the author made was stating his theories here and there. He claims that these theories are true, but does not provide any explanation to help the reader understand his train of thought in order to arrive at their own conclusion. Theories are great fun, but I am turned off by someone who tells me what there theory is, claims that it's obviously true, but doesn't tell me why. I rarely leave a book unread, but just couldn't finish this one."
2,A passionate but poorly organized and over-written work.,"I wanted to like this book because I think the author, John Jay Harper, is a nice, smart, honest man. However, the book was grueling to read, and quite confusing. I think Mr. Harper might have benefited from a really good editor to help him present his ideas. I think he does have valid ideas and insights but they were so badly presented that it was nearly impossible to find them."
2,Gratuitously violent,"I don't usually say that, either. This movie is just too much. There are people who can handle violence in films and then there are those who cannot. This is an example of the latter."
1,typical horror flick,"Disgusting genre is all I can say and I have a very low opinion of peoplewho watch or make this junk . Just being as mild as I possibly can .It is especially sad because I know there are peoplewho think it is fun for their children to watch this .This was a typical one . The message of course is people are garbage anddeserve to die . There is no art or other message here .All you see is people behaving badly and at the end beingslaughtered .The last kill is a sex torture believe it or not . Hollywoodis constantly testing the boundaries of what is acceptable . Who knows howfar they will go in the future .SPOILER : If you are waiting for the end to see the serial killers get it ,ain't gonna happen . As I have already said , the movie is sympathetic tothe killers ; they are the protagonists here ."
1,Disappointing considering the actors,"Wow, this movie was pretty poorly put together. I like Julia and Bill, but this movie did neither of them justice. I found the movie to be pretty predictable and did not like it at all. It left me wishing I had the time back I had wasted on watching it."
3,Disturbing but interesting,"I should have known this would be a violent film when I saw the director was David Lynch's daughter but by the same token I knew it would also be a psychologically compelling film. From the start it's disturbing, murder of unknown couple and then introduction of many different characters who all seem to have witnessed something that is connected to the murderers. Bill Pullman is very cool as always as is Julia Ormond - the little girl though steals the show - in the end I was glad I saw it although it added to my already pile high image of violence both in movies and in real life. But what the movie shows most of all is that it's not the violence that's the worst but rather the complete lack of feelings from those who perpetrate it. Unless getting ""high"" off of killing is a feeling - I suppose it is then. Disturbing move for sure but worth watching."
1,negative stars,"With different direction, use of the alternate ending, and with the fine acting abilities of Pullman, Ormond, and Pell James, this could have been an excellent movie.Instead it was a horrible waste of time, slow to develop, silly, disgusting, confusing, annoying and frustrating. One of the worst films of the year."
1,Just not any good,"I had hopes for this movie, because I am a Bill Pullman fan, but there was only one even halfway likeable character, and that was the little girl. It was partially told through flashbacks, which would work in some films, but just made this one seem endless. I could not work up any sympathy for anyone, except the kid.And the mystery wasn't that great, either. I had it figured out well before the halfway mark.Very glad I didn't pay any more to see it at the theater."
1,A Bloody Awful Mess,"This is not disturbing it's laughably bad. I won't waste my time writing on it, don't waste yours watching it. One conclusion: clearly film making is not genetic. Like father does not equal like daughter."
1,Was this made by a high school kid?,"This movie is about the excessive lengths David Lynch went to so that he wouldn't have to tell his kid that she has no business being a film maker. I can't imagine what he must have paid Pullman and Ormond to go along with the gag, but since I haven't gotten any checks from David Lynch yet, I'm free to warn you not to see this ugly little pile of boring."
1,Disgusting,"I'm up for a B movie. I like Bill Pullman and French Stewart, so I decided this was an ok way to spend an hour and a half. I followed the gore and hollow dialogue for an hour and 20 minutes until it became clear that there was going to be a Karla Faye Tucker moment. Even people who make movies should have some decency. Kent Harper had the arrogance to write, direct, and act in this piece of garbage. Even in the name of ""creative expression"" or ""art,"" this is a piece of junk. If you'd like another look at a piece of junk, take a peek at Harper's [...] bio. He wrote it himself. Makes himself sound like Aaron Spelling.Please don't watch this movie."
1,"""Worser"" than Worst","Flag my attention with Julia Ormond.Take a mediocre plot, twist it like a piece of taffy (so that it just offbeat enough to appear barely ""cool"" enough to keep watching), and then load it down with gore as a reward.David Lynch indeed has come on hard times."
2,Didn't really work for me,"The film draws you in for the first half of it. But then it took a turn to ""not bloody likely"". Even with me thinking Julia Ormond is super hot, I couldn't get into the ending of this film. And, for a suspense drama where it builds up to the ending, the end of the story is really the whole point of the movie. The truth of the crime turns out to be way to complex to have pulled off except in the most usually luckiest of situations. And, since this is a planned crime, it just doesn't hold water. If you can turn your brain off the second half of the film, I suppose this movie would be entertaining, but I wasn't able to manage it."
1,Not Entertainment,This movie was disturbing to watch because the content and plot were filled with twisted and deranged intent. It was unfortunate that we purchased it instead of renting it because we threw it in the garbage. The actors Julie O. and Bill P. are actors who have a great reputation and we anticipated enjoying their performance. The movie went from sick to perverted and left not one redeeming quality. This type of movie is not entertainment and we take full responsibility for watching such a disgusting movie. We will tell everyone we know to stay away from this movie and we will now spend the next few hours working hard to rid our minds of the horrible scenes we viewed. We did not want to give one star above for the rating but I couldn't figure out how to leave a negative number of stars. Please protect yourself from being part of promoting such awful movies and do not watch Surveillance.
5,I love them,I bought these shorts to go on a cruise. They were perfect. I wasn't sure how it was going to be to buy clothes online however it turned out great.
5,Some wonderful versions of recipes that you thought you knew,"I want to go on record that Sax's apple pancake is so good it is worth the price of the book. He has many interesting recipes that you may have seen elsewhere, but his are better, clearer and in general more accessible. The woman who complained that his 1,2,3,4 cake was the same as her recipe obviously doesn't know that the 1,2,3,4 cake is a standard recipe. It is in my Joy as well as many other cook books. Sax doesn't claim to have invented the cake. He has tried to find really tasty and interesting recipes for people combined in one book. I made the pumpkin creme brulee for my husband who had craved something like this for a long time and he loved it. Where else would you find a recipe like this?"
5,Best Overall Dessert Cookbook Ever!,"This is a fantastic collection of recipes and dessert history. Very user friendly, and all that I have cooked from here has come out wonderfully. It is always a source of inspiration to get in the kitchen and have fun!"
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!","This book is a feast for the eyes and the imagination! Not only do the recipes work but the photograhs and stories keep me looking through this cookbook over and over. I have owned this book for years and never tire of it. It seems to offer something new each time I open it. I am a pastry chef and have countless cookbooks and I can say without hesitation that this is one of my three favorites along with ""Baking with Julia"" and ""The Cake Bible"""
3,BUYER BEWARE!,"Pages 297-312 are missing, possibly more...Extremely poor quality control by HOUGHTON MIFFLIN HARCOURT PUBLISHING CO...Too much trouble to return to Amazon.Com."
3,Historical research and background Information is well researched,This book in more of a contribution for its historical interest than its recipes. I found it very interesting. It is a interesting reference.
1,Not worth the ingredients or effort!,"I took this book out from the library because of the reviews given. I made the 1-2-3-4 cake to use up some buttermilk I had. I looked on the back of the box of cake flour and saw this same recipe. The author changed from milk to buttermilk, and added baking soda besides the baking powder in the recipe. My cake overflowed all over my oven even though I followed instructions of using 3, 8-in. pans. The cake stuck to the pans, torn in clumps, I was able to piece it together because I am an expierienced baker. I never had this problem before and I bake from scratch quite a bit. It was tasteless, and my husband only ate half a piece and left the rest. The last cake I made, he ate 2 pieces because he couldn't help himself, it was so good. I returned the book to the library the next day. THIS IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY to buy the book. There are too many really good books with great recipes to waste your time with this one!"
4,A Fascinating Volumn,"Great book, wonderful notes, beautiful photo, terrific backround and general instructions, sensible guidelines. The mixed summer fruit cobbler, and the Pastiche Bakery raspberry- cranberry tart are always a hit when a make them for company or as a gift. One quibble-for me, some of the cake recipes fall or collapse and I am not normally used to that happening"
4,Cursive Writing Made Easy & Fun!,"Great practices - I just wish that the pages were ""erasable"" so I could have my other children practice too, without 'tracing' over what was already done."
5,Great cursive book,This book is really great! There are a lot of activities to do as well as practice worksheets. I'd recommend it.
3,Consider Cursive Italic Instead,"My 3 star rating is not of the book mentioned, it is for what the book teaches. This style of handwriting is archaic. If you're learning it for the sake of your own entertainment, please ignore this review. If you're planning on learning or teaching handwriting for practical (daily) use, you (or your child) will be much better served by learning some form of cursive italic writing instead. Something along the lines of, ""Write Now: The Complete Program For Better Handwriting"", By Getty and Dubay or similar would be a good choice.P.S. I would have liked making a comment without rating the item. I thought about giving it one start, but that seemed inconsiderate to the author (directing potential buyers to another product may not be considerate either, but I wanted to be clear that I'm not saying this book is ""bad"" -- only that better subject matter is available)."
5,The Most Successful Comic Book Villian of All Time!,"One of My Favorites from the Early Marvel Legends Waves. This was a Long Awaited Figure and there was Much Attention to Detail. The Folds in His Tunic and Cloak Add a Very Dunamic Look to the Figure, Especially when Displayed on the Included Base. The Metal of His Armor is Perfectly Tarnished to Give it a ""Lived-In"" Feel. The Gun on His Belt can Be Drawn and Fits in Doom's Hands, although He Seldom Draws it in the Comics. Even His Mask can Be Removed to Reveal a Face that's Not Quite as Scarred as the Vain-Glorious Wearer Believes it to Be. Being a ""Benevolent"" Dictator of His Home Country, Victor Von Doom is One of the Most Successful Villians of All Time (and My Personal Favorite). A Great Figure and an Essential Piece in any Marvel Collection."
3,Great songs but beware.....,"Great songs, obviously, and a good selection that includes just about every song the casual fan might want to own, but a little truth in advertising would be helpful: three of these songs (Me and Bobby McGee, The Pilgrim, and Casey's Last Ride) are live recordings. If that's not what you're looking for, there are better collections available."
5,Wonderful CD,I am a big fan of Kris Kristofferson's music. He is and always has been my favorite songwriter. The songs are great.
3,You might try another collection CD,"CD includes 7 of his biggest hits. The only thing I would like to have known in advance is that Me and Bobby McGee, The Pilgrim and Caseys Last Ride were live recordings. I would have preferred studio recordings."
1,Poor Quality Kindle Edition,"The quality of the Kindle version of this book is very poor. It looks as if one is reading a poor quality scan rather than rendered text. The type face is very light and jagged. Worse still, are the whitespace breaks between letters within words. It's like reading code rather than prose. Unfortunately, I didn't start reading the book until well after the seven day return policy and now I'm stuck with it but, don't you get stuck with it. If you want this book, get the hard copy and avoid the Kindle version at all cost."
2,PAL system needed,The previously owned Dvd's purchased seemed to be in good condition but when I hiot the play button it was a black and white rolling picture. I couldn't figure out what was wrong until a friend of mine told me it was in a European format. It will play on a laptop but alas not on my flat screen =...(
4,Help for the backyard gardener,I am very happy with this guide. I have long wanted to know which caterpillars would turn into moths and butterflies to enjoy and which would defoliate my garden without and esthetic gain. This is a very nice addition to my identification process
5,Great Caterpillar Guidebook,This guidebook is by far one of the best I've seen in the world of caterpillars. We've been searching for a guidebook that would help identify caterpillars in the field. This book is well organized with great photos and information. It is easily carried into the field. I highly recommend this guidebook for eastern caterpillars.
5,Caterpillars of Eastern North America,This is the best work I have ever seen on this subject. I recommend it very highly.
4,Caterpillars of Eastern North America,Finally I can look up all the Caterpillars I find here :)Great book !!..............Margrit
5,The Best Caterpillar Field Guide,"This is a terrific field guide. 700 species of caterpillars of butterflies and moths are represented. All the moth caterpillars that you can't find anywhere else are in this book! Great photos, good organization. Lots of other helpful information is included, like habitat, common food plants, geographic distribution, and when they occur. Highly Recommended!"
5,Another reference for the wife.,This was another of the suggested references from my wifes Naturalist class. This book was used by the University of Minnesota as a part of their Master Naturalist course. A lot of information is available about this subject.
5,Caterpillars of Eastern North America: A Guide to Identification and Natural History (Princeton Field Guides),Great photographs. Good information. A must addition to your library for amateur or professional naturalist.
5,Excellent,"Excellent book for the field; I use it often, looking to ID caterpillars found at our organic nursery. Great buy!"
3,"Good, but not amazing","I love the music of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and Heavy Trash. I also appreciate the works of Calvin and K records. There are definitely some fun tracks on this one, but over all I think it sounds like they had more fun making it than the listener has hearing it. Its a jam session, Calvin style. Not as good as the other Dub Narc. albums."
1,"No Dub, bub","I love JSBX, but Dub Narcotic is lame. Skip it, this shizzle aint worth a free download, let alone $14.98. If you want JSBX dub remixes, do it yerself, skip this tripe."
3,good but hard and i hate the fuel you run out all the time,good game play but preaty good grafics but way to hard i barely got past the 3rd level! and the fule really drags you down in how many levels you get past.
5,A surprising and happy find,"I am victim to what many other reviewers have said about this book, I picked it up on a whim and didn't cherish high hopes for it. Within the first chapter though, I could tell I would enjoy reading it. Lilli Thal's writing style borders on romantic, entwining fantasy and poem seemlessly into her prose. Normally I hate books that do that, and I usually skip over the songs the authors put in as I can't be bothered to read them, but every tale and every silly song that she wrote enhances the story. Each line has a second meaning, and it's up to you, dear reader, and our young hero to decipher it. I personally can't wait until someone else I know reads it so I can discuss the book at length!"
4,A rare account of historical fiction,"You probably have so many examples of historical fiction telling about the kings, queens, princess, prince, and sometimes the fools. But nothing so far has the decency to write a story of a miserable but witty fool. All other books usually just emphasize on the grandeur of the kingdom and even if the main character was a fool, you can bet she/he won't be suffering like Mimus was.I like Mimus despite his 'cruelty' to Florin and his sense of 'humor'.A highly recommended story which is not too heavy but also not too light. Everyone will get nice parts in it, even till the end."
5,I love Medieval fiction,"and this book was no exception. I bought it because the cover looked interesting, but I didn't think I'd really enjoy it all that much. THankfully I was very pleasantly surprised. Historical fiction with a hint of adventure, and no magic or 'happily ever after'/badly written romance --- just my style."
5,"Dark, astonishing, moving, and wonderful!","I just finished reading MIMUS and I can't find enough good things to say about it. Original, funny, frightening, full of compassion, and written in clear, unpretentious prose, this is one of the best, most heart-warming stories of the year.Buy this book. You won't regret it."
2,Low quality and overpriced,"I got this pendant for my mom for mother's day and was surprised at the low quality. It looks like something you can get at Walmart for $10.00. The chain is cute, but I would not buy from this dealer again."
4,Nice record with rare DJ track - collectors take notice,"There's actually two tracks on this record: the A-side contains Salt N' Pepa's debut ""The Showstoppa"". It's a parody and dis of both ""The Show"" and ""La Di Da Di"" by Doug E. Fresh. The rhyming is fairly good, and the beat is ok but really just a poorer imitation of ""The Show"". The real treat is the B-side, Marley Marl's ""DJ Cuttin"". He released it under the name NYC Cutter in 1985, and the original record is extremely rare (however it also appeared on ""Electro 8""). It consists of a fairly basic drum track, but this instrumental track is not typical of Marley Marl's other work from that period. He cuts up diverse sounds over the beat, including screeching tires and an electric guitar, all performed very well. One of the better DJ tracks of its time."
4,Super bien illustré!,Un très bel ouvrage. Splendide! Avec un retour dans le temps et tout les mystères qu'un groupe peut avoir. Si vous aimés Genesis vous devriez déja regarder pour cette superbe ouvrage d'Armando Gallo. Moi j'ai la version franaise pour votre information.
3,Condition was not according to the description.,The book is arrived in a very short time which is a good point.I have been desapointed by the condition of the book which is very good but not collectible !I especialy have choose this items to get the book in gift condition which is not the case.I've paid an high price and the good is not according to the description.For this reason I didn't vote for a five stars review.
1,BAD!,"I am a power metal fan, but Squealer...I can't say enough bad things about them. For one thing, their singer has the sorriest range of any power metal voice. The production on this record is sloppy. The riffs are boring and highly cliched. The album art is plainly stupid. The band's name is just stupid as well. And finally, how dare the bassist for the great German power metal crew Edguy play with this awful band! Equally bad is their cover (or should I say, absolute butchery) of the Helloween classic ""Victim of Fate."" Stay away from this at ALL COSTS!"
3,A Granddaughter's First Doll,"In November I purchased a Russ Berrie 16"" Button Eye Raggedy Ann for my one-year-old Granddaughter. She was delivered promptly in a cardboard post office box. I wished she had been packaged in her own Raggedy box for better Christmas wrapping. I was very disappointed in the stitching around the apron. In fact, I took out the upper apron stitching and my seamstress sister resewed in for me. A few strands of her yarn hair at the back of her head had come out of the stitching and had to be pulled back through. Otherwise, she was cute and all the colors were bright and clean."
4,Granddaughter's Christmas present,"I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas. She is 2 and this is a very good doll to squeeze and sleep with. Raggedy Ann has the button eyes and is very cute. I don't think she is a durable doll, but she will last for the love she will receive."
4,Great Retro Toy,"Husband and I wanted a gift for our daughter that didn't require batteries or a gaming system. We just wanted a toy she could enjoy and use her imagination. She loves it and it has become one of her favorites, a retreat from the noise toys of today, just simple fun she enjoys for hours."
2,Cheap.,"This thing ripped the first time I put my drum into it. Also, the straps are flimsy, which almost caused me to drop (and likely break) the drum."
2,Title is Misleading,"I think the book was good but the title is misleading. The author fails to engage the reader with ""lab work"" that would truley be needed to be a weekend course. It simply has text and review queestions wich is not enough interaction to keep a person engaged in the material. So what happend to me was that by Saturday morning I wasn't involved enough to continue. Now I just pick up the book during down time at work and read a chapter here and there. I think it is an easy read but I wish I was actually applying the information as I learn it."
3,Long and obscure.,"The name ""UML Weekend Crash Course"" is misleading. I don't think anyone can read and understand it in one weekend, unless of course he is reading about six times faster than me. This book has long and obscure sentences and too much of unnecessary information. The chapter on Object-Oriented principles is written so badly, that I doubt in the authors competence. It mentions two major OO postulates ""encapsulation"" and ""inheritance"" but leaves out the third one ""polymorphism"". But he rumbles on for pages about some unrelated stuff. Also, this book was published before the UML-2 standard came out, so it is somewhat outdated. I would recommend ""UML Distilled"" by Martin Fowler instead of this book."
3,"Not a bad book, but some annoying mistakes","For the most part, it is a pretty good book. I agree it would be difficult to finish in a weekend. Some annoying mistakes in a few places. For example, on p198-200 the figures are full of mistakes and don't follow along with the text. They are not too hard to correct, but you should not have to do so when you are trying to learn something new. I like this type of format for a book where you pace yourself and then have a review and quiz after a short session. Not too bad, but could be better."
4,A good way to start and learn UML,"Highly recommend. As a UML newbie, I had gone thru a lot of UML books, but I found this one takes a more concrete and sensible approach to UML. And it is very easy to understand the entire UML concepts.This book goes far from a quick tutorial and introduces all the UML concepts in a logical manner."
3,Odd Choices,"Overall, this is a very nice rendition of The Thing, with some good articulation. It has a pleasing heaviness to it, a real solidity.But there are two very strange choices. First, his display stand is flat out idiotic, as other reviewers have noted. I have no idea what they were thinking. Secondly, his hands are open. I'm not asking for an action figure that has fully articulated fingers--I recognize that's not really viable. I am struggling to understand, however, why a character whose most memorable motto is ""It's Clobbering Time"" is rendered as an action figure with open hands. C'mon! It's the Thing! He should have at least ONE hand formed into a fist."
1,Unimaginative,"This entire series is a huge let down. No real accessories with Ben. He just stands there; the backdrop item, just holds together with a rubberband.You have to have all the figures in this series. The variant, with trenchcoat and sunglasses is a much better figure. At least there's more to it, than, nothing.I give this a 1 star, because it wreaks of boring. 35 of 100.The variant, is cool. I give the variant 3 of 5 stars, 75 of 100"
3,Rawlings Clear Baseball Display Cube,"The cube was nice but the plastic that the ball sits on was a flimsly plastic, not a ""hardened"" type plastic; I thought this cheapened the product; but for the price you can't complain!"
5,"Depressing and funny, all at once...","This expatriate Californian still can't believe that The Gropinator made it to the governor's office. That said, this book is chock-full o' beefcake photos, hilariously captioned. Andy Borowitz is an incredibly prolific writer these days, and almost everything he touches turns to comic gold (including his daily news ""SHOCKERS!"" delivered by e-mail).A great gift item, too. Buy 'em by the bag!"
1,Lousy Valve Stem,"Note to tube manufacturers: If you sell a tube specially designed not to leak, charge a few pennies more and use a metal valve stem. The tube may be fine, but I'll never know because the valve stem is cheap. After two rides, the stem developed a leak next to the wheel hole, even though it was almost straight. I've never seen a valve stem leak at the wheel that was as straight as this one, and I've seen a lot of tubes last years with much more angle on the valve stems."
5,Great,"The tube is a lot thicker than I imagined. I haven't tried it out yet because of the change in the weather, but I'm excited for spring to arrive. Shipping was fast too."
1,stems broke off after one bike ride,"The tubes are amazing, very thick and strong. The dimensions fit my bike perfectly.But the stems are super THIN. As I pumped up the tire, the stems started shifting from the hole. I kept trying to straighten out. It was off just a little, pointing in at an slight angle.Then I went for a ride, came back and PFFFFFFF, the stem ripped and out came the air.It seems like a dumb thing to skimp on the stems when the tire is so durable."
1,Do Not Buy!,I have purchased three of these in the last two months. I only get a few rides out of them before I get a leak right at the valve stem. My local bikeshop installed the first time and after the first leak I went back to purchase another tube and showed them the problem. They said that I must not have had the correct tire pressure in them while I was riding. Everytime since then I have confirmed the tire pressure before the ride. These tires clearly have a design problem at the valve stem. They aren't worth the money.
1,Thin spots in rubber,"Item arrived on time. Pumped up a tube to 30 psi; I noticed it didn't inflate evenly, so the tire blew within 15 seconds at the weak spot. I cut the tube open to look at the uniformity. Just a thin spot in the rubber about 3 inches long. Wish I'd had some ear plugs in.Fortunately, I bought 3. If the other tubes do well; I'll write another review, but for now these tubes were manufactured poorly. I wouldn't think it would be difficult to get rubber to a uniform thickness with heat.Jokes on me......they got paid anyway."
1,Cheap Valve Stem,"In all the tubes I've bought and repaired while cycling through Utah, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, and Nevada I've never had one that did what this tube did. I installed it and not a day later my tire was flat. Upon close inspection, the valve stem had busted open and was leaking air like a sieve. I attempted to patch it, but patching a rubber valve stem is trickier than I thought, so the tube remains useless. In summary, DO NOT BUY THIS TUBE IT HAS A CHEAP VALVE STEM! Unless you are good at patching valve stems, which never having had the necessity to do so, I was not."
5,Great Tubes,"I mounted these today and wanted to write a review immediately. I have a 27"", 10 speed Pugeot bicycle. I have replace tires and tubes several times over the years. After shopping, I decided to try a pair of these Sunlite thorn resistant tubes. Like the other reviewers mentioned, they are heavier, a lot heavier. They are a thicker rubber and the box alone they come in is at least three times the size of a normal tube box. You do not want to use these for a spare as they do not package as neatly as a normal tube. However, they mounted very easily inside a pair of Tioga Bloodhounds. They are heavier so they probably cost me a little on the speed but I do not have to worry about them leaking in a few months. The order was filled through Niagra Cycle Works who promptly filled and shipped the order. I would recommend these tubes to anyone not over concerned with top end speed."
1,Didn't even last as long as my non-thorn resistant tires,"I am sure I don't know as much about bike things as a lot of the other folks who have posted here. All I know is that I paid a bit extra for a ""thorn resistant tube"" and it didn't last as long before my next flat as my other ""normal"" tubes. Don't think I'll purchase again. Doesn't seem worth it. Statistically N = 1, but I don't have the money or patience to do any more sampling."
3,Not What I Thought,I had thought this book would be full of common recipes but instead the recipes have lots of ingredients & are just more than I was looking for.
1,easy read,"I will try some of these recipes, however looks like lots of item in each recipe, seems kind of costly."
4,excelent,"this is cd that has some new stuff that i think we'll be seeing more of in the near future, a rap and rock mix thats hard and quick. Yummy."
2,Jump off the bandwagon before it's too late,"Rage Against the Machine called. They want their music back ... oh wait, incoming call ... (10 seconds elapse) ... that was 311, they said they want their music back too."
5,Bolted from tha BASEment,"The dude who said jump off tha bandwagon is clearly mis-informed! Bolt Upright are original and have been incorporating many different styles into their music since way before 311. Tha CD is slammin ,Live is Jammin so check 'em out before they Bolt on to tha next level!"
4,Funny,"This novel which calls itself ""A Charlatan Romance"" is a spoof of romance novels. Never having read a romance novel, I must resort to inference and deduction to gauge how well it parodies them. Romance novels deal heavily with feelings and emotions and presumably have developed their own language and style. ""Love's Reckless Rash"" has fun with this language, and it also parodies the plots of romance novels. Playboy says ""'Love's Reckless Rash' does for the gothic romance what 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' did for science fiction."" Though both are funny, it doesn't remind me of ""Hitchhiker's Guide."" It reminds me of the movie ""Airplane."" Like Airplane it plays with verbal expressions. Also like Airplane, every individual gag isn't a winner, but the bombardment is relentless. It will make you laugh."
5,Pain Brings Relief,"THIS CD IS AWESOME! i am constantly on the look out for great music and i dont know how this band eluded me for so long. I feel like i missed a big part of music history. Catchy music, fun and well written lyrics, and horns! who could ask for anything more? Pain is one of those bands that you can listen to and think..""wow..these guys had alot of fun doing this"" and thats what music is all about. doing your thing and having fun.I highly recommend this and any other Pain cd you can find. theyre out there. Get them and make your life better."
5,even better than midgets with guns,"as hard as it is to believe, this album is superior to midgets with guns in everything but length.. when its over you just feel like it should keep going forever, but since it doesn't you just listen to again.. and again.. it makes me happy. everyone i've ever known that has listned to it has liked it, danced to it, felt the necessity to memorize all the lyrics and sing along... pain writes the best songs.. in my life Pain has the same function as They Might Be Giants, and so i tend to group them together and Pain writes better songs.. thats the highest praise i think i could give anyone."
3,"Cool Book, but not very sturdy","Okay, maybe my 2 year old is a bruiser, but this book just didn't make the ""tough enough"" test - which is too bad because he really liked it. In fact, I've tried to toss our mangled copy a couple of times and he always rescues it for one more read. The story is cute, I just wish someone could design an interactive book that can handle little fingers pulling and pushing"
1,Complete rip off--not worth the money,"I paid $50 for this and I'm kicking myself for it. It does ""spray"" soap and water onto the cars, but just barely. Even if you put a towel under it, it still manages to make an absolute mess. The parts that are supposed to move barely move, and those that aren't supposed to, do. My 3 yr old was bored with it after a few minutes. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Terrible,"I enjoy Charisma Carpenter's work, I really do. But this movie - how on earth did she let herself be talked into such a woeful waste of time? To say the acting, beside hers, is abysmal would be an act of kindness. The husband and the agent's acting was so bad it made me cringe. At least it was a cheap buy. There's nothing about this train wreck that is worth recommending."
2,Charisma still gorgeous...but don't let that lead you to buy this movie.,"I am a huge fan of Charisma Carpenter, ever since I saw her on Buffy. I haven't seen her do much since Angel finished. I enjoy horror movies, even the bad ones. Some of the reviewers here list the movie as having gratuitous nudity. There are a couple of semi-quick scenes, but I was expecting much more based off of the reviews. The acting isn't great by any means. I wish I had rented this instead of buying this (i got the Instant Video version for my Kindle). I tend to buy movies instead of renting, due to having a toddler running around, I don't want to spend $4 for a 3 day rental and then not being able to finish it. The production values are about what you expect for a direct to video film. I won't post any spoilers here. As i said, I often enjoy bad horror films that others do not, but this wasn't worth the hour and a half, even if you are a fan of Charisma."
3,3 and a half !,"This is the album that marks the begining of the end of The Cult's history. It isn't a bad album, on the contrary, it has great songs like ""Sweet salvation"" or ""Wild hearted son"", it has a great sound production and so on, but it has some very boring moments too, without inspiration and without the strenght they had on, for example ""Electric"". Some people may say it is more mature, but I say it is less genuine."
5,this IS the cult,"this cd is definately my personal favorite cult cd.from beginning to end is really brilliant. from hits like wild hearted son,& heart of soul. to rock songs like earth mofo,ceremony,white,if and the beautiful-sweet salvation. theres is a little something for everyone on this cd, its totally worth the buy so get it and listen to it and be as facinated with it as i am!"
2,#4 Puts This One To Shame,I have to admit I loved the first one; however' the second and third were not worth renting. Cool Borders 4 tops them all. The fourth in the series allows a lot of freedom with tricks. The only down side is that once you master it in a week or so you get bored with it.
3,Cover Not Always What the Game is About,Overall the game appears to be slick and a great addition to the series. It does have newer graphics and much better animae however it fails to deliver the excitment and challenges that Cool Boarders 2 provided. In addition there is no real system of moving through a competition. Head to head is not near the excitement of C2.I recommend renting it at Blockbusters rather than buying. One session and it WILL be returned.
5,Awsome game !!!!!!!!!!,"This game is so good !!!!! I don't even have to beat it I just have fun play with a friend. The coolest thing about this game are the tricks. Some of favourites are: Misty, Rodeo and salute. Get this game even if you don't snowboard ( comme moi, I ski ) If you don't you don't have a decent Library."
1,DO NOT USE ON EYES OR...GENITALS,"I used this for the first time today, about 8 hours ago, and my eyes are still burning. Do NOT use this on your face at all, or on your private parts. It says not to get this in your eyes on the bottle, but I didn't get it in my eyes...I just lathered it up and washed my face quickly. Bad mistake. It immediately started burning around my eyes, especially under them and now I have to bright red blotches. If you get this, don't use it on your face or genitals - you'll regret it."
5,A Very Invigorating and Concentrated Soap,This soap is wonderfully energizing and has a very refreshing aroma. It's also very concentrated so a single bottle lasts over a year. My skin and face are in great condition so I can see no downside. Perhaps you would prefer a soap that ran out faster so that you could enjoy a variety of fragrances? Perhaps you find the powerful cooling sensation unpleasant? Perhaps your method of applying soap to yourself is incompatible with such a concentrated soap? These are the only reasons I can think of for not enjoying this soap.
3,Dr Bronner Peppermint Shampoo - okay,"This shampoo was so watery that it takes a lot of shampoo to wash all my hair, and it doesn't lather up like I'm used to other shampoos doing. But I know that it is all-natural and so it's better for me since whatever touches your skin goes into your body. It was rated a #1 on the Environmental Working Group website. Because of that, I will buy it again."
1,Dr. Bronner - Castile Soap Tea Tree,"The soap, without the Tea Tree oil is outstanding, as usual. However, the Tea Tree smells like tar. It is not a pleasant odor. In the future, I will stick with the Peppermint."
1,threw it out,the reason i purchased this was because i read some review on pintrest that it works to clean pans. Well first it has palm oil and 2nd who the heck writes such junk on a bottle? the thing creeped me out.
1,NOT AS LABELED!,"I returned this item because I was sent something with hemp in it, which is clearly not mentioned in the add. I was contacted by someone apologizing and assisted me to return and get a refund, and they said as consideration they would send me a different peppermint body wash to try, only that was three months ago and I still haven't seen it, so I am reposting my review of it.Don't order, you don't get what is listed, they send you the peppermint that has hemp in it and it feels extra oily."
5,Love it!,"No problems at all. This makes a great body wash. Also have used it for general cleaning around the house, including doing dishes. It does have a strong scent, but I love it."
5,Dr Bronner's is the Best!,I use Dr Bronner's liquid peppermint soap for all my house cleaning and laundry! I love the rich peppermint smell! It's great!
5,"Good Service, Great Price",We have used this product for years and this was an excellent price. The service was prompt. We will buy from them again.
2,Dr. Bronner doesn't agree with my skin,"If I use this product in a bath soak more than once in a row I get itchy skin. So does my daughter. In fact, she gets a reaction after using just once. We're both fair skinned red heads. It's too expensive to use for general cleaning. (It does keep the bathtub clean) It may be a great product for some people. Just not me."
3,Loved the smell!,"Love natural products and like the fact that this was fair trade so I ordered a bottle. Tried several of the uses but wasn't pleased with most of the results, but the smell was divine!"
2,Bummed,"I purchased this product to use for cleaning my cookie sheets. It didn't work like I thought it would, which is fine, but what I really didn't like is that it made everything it touched turn orange and rusty. I got it on my nice stovetop griddle, and the thing now looks like I left it out in the rain for 3 years. Now I treat this stuff like acid. If it's open, I have gloves and won't touch anything with it."
1,Scent Repulsed Me,"Something in the product's fragrance profile resembled vomit to me, to the extent that I became nauseated while using the soap for laundry. I generally love rose-scented products. As this was a very unpleasant experience, hopefully I am the only person who will have this experience. Also when I used it in cold water, the soap solidified on clothes. I am looking forward to trying the unscented version, for hot & warm washes."
1,didn't work for me,i ordered it because my 14 month old has sensitive skin. it gave her a rash immediately after bathing her. i stopped using it for her since the first use. i used it for myself and it left this weird sticky feeling on my skin.
5,Don't read the bottle,"Not sure what Dr. Bronner was smoking when he/she designed the label for this soap, but I'll take whatever she/he had when designing the actual soap. Very ""simple,"" smells great, lathers well on a loofa/Japanese bathing towel, and leaves your skin with that cool/refreshing tingling feeling. Doesn't get better than this."
5,Great product,We need this product for medical reasons on a daily basis; and there is no other like it.I wish the costs were better; which is why I buy larger so I don't pay everyone's inflated prices on the smaller bottles and it saves on shipping in the long run
5,works on silk,"I have several expensive silk blouses that the care tag says dry clean only. This soap works great to gently clean the blouses. Hand wash in the sink, not the washer. It even removes makeup."
4,For a very clean feeling,"I am a fan of Dr. Bronner soaps. My favorite is the peppermint scent, but the tea tree soap still works very well for that clean feeling.Great product!"
5,This stuff is the best,"I think this is the best soap I've ever used. Ever. I have never felt cleaner. I watched a documentary about this product and the family history and had to try it. I am glad I did. Honestly, the label creeps me out a little bit, but at the same time I find it kinda fascinating. This stuff can be used as shampoo, body wash, laudry detergent...and plenty of other things. The fact that it is totally organic is just another awesome bonus. Try it."
4,Bad skin smell.,"I got the peppermint kind, it cleans well and is good for washing but I do not like the smell it leaves on my skin. Maybe it just doesn't work for me(I'm a man)."
4,Ideal Liquid Soap for Showering,"Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Castile Soap is a very good natural soap without countless harsh chemicals like its counterparts. When purchasing this soap, I was looking for soap with natural ingredients that would not dry out the skin and that would be consistent. Some other natural soap I've tried will be good for one body part but not for another body part, i.e., it would be good for the body but not for the face or for other sensitive areas. Dr. Bronner's soap, however, is consistent and it is natural. One disadvantage of this soap is that it does leave the skin feeling dry after showering because it has no moisturizing ingredients. Adding some jojoba oil or almond oil to the solution helps with the drying though. I would recommend this castile soap to individuals looking for a safe alternative to the traditional soap with harsh chemicals that are so plentiful at the grocery store."
3,Soap ok,"Soap ok but not greater. Smell does not remain on your skin, unlike the other Dr Bronner soaps (lavender,etc). The rose flavoring need to be stronger."
4,Soap without the chemicals...,"I really like using Dr. Bronner's or other castile soaps for everyday handwashing, etc. It seems a bit drying for body wash, and castile soap made my hair very limp and stringy when I tried it as shampoo. However, I do use it in all of my bathrooms and kitchen for handwashing. In that application I actually dilute it quite a bit...I have some foaming handwash dispensers (not the automatic kind, just old, reused Softsoap foaming dispensers) and am able to fill about 1/3 of each with water while still getting really good lather. This helps the product last a really long time and we haven't had any problems with the soap going bad (don't know if that's even possible...) so I feel it works well. I don't notice much of a rose smell from this, but that could be because we typically use it diluted..."
4,"It's a good soap, but check at your local grocery store first.","I've been using this soap for 3 weeks now, twice daily. I really like the clean and fresh feeling it lends your skin after use. It's a little drying, but since I'm using it during the sweaty Houston summer, this is not a concern. I've also used it as a shampoo, and it makes it frizz quite a bit (I have slightly thin, straight hair). I'll probably stick to using it as soap only.My only advice would be to check at your local store first. I bought this (16oz Tea Tree) for $9.99, and found the 32oz to be $10 at Whole Foods. Disappointing to see that after my purchase, but I picked up the 32oz of the Peppermint + Hemp for the same price!"
5,LOVE THIS SOAP!!!,What a eye opener!!! I love the way it picks me up and makes me feel so fresh and clean without drying out my skin. I will never use another soap again!!! I thought maybe it would be too much for winter time but no way... gets me goin in the am's!
5,Should last me a year,"Great product, but a little pricey. I might try making some myself as all it takes is lye and oil."
3,"Good cleaner, but not on my hair","I use this now as a household cleaner and it is great for that.I it once on my hair. Washed and rinsed twice. Rinsed for 10 minutes and still couldn't get it out of my hair. My hair was as if someone pour wax on it. I couldn't even get a comb through it.Good for cleaning, but it doesn't work well on my hair."
5,this soap is great and a little goes a long way,great product for anyone who enjoys feeling clean. it works excellent on clothing and hair also. i really love it.
4,I love Dr. Bronner's soaps!,"I was interested in trying out the various scented versions of Bronner's well-known ""Pure Castile Soap,"" so I ordered the hemp almond. It smells a little more ""Bath & Bodyworks"" than I had anticipated; it's got a decidedly girl-ish (as in the type of young teen who buys that fake vanilla scent at the mall - bleh) scent to it straight out of the bottle, but it mellows out and the scent doesn't linger. Despite that, I won't be using it as a body wash -- this bottle will be delegated to dish duty and the like.I think I will try the Lavender scent next -- I hear that it smells more like the actual Lavender plant, as opposed to the chemically-formed, mall-bought version."
4,"nice smell, very relaxing not too strong","This is probably the closest product to smelling like real lavender. However, I still prefer the boldness of the Peppermint."
5,The peppermint soap cleared my acne,"I tried various kids of Dr Bronner soaps (peppermint, lavender, eucalytus, orange, and almond) The peppermint was the only one that cleared my back/face acne. I recommended the peppermint to my friend for her acne and she had an allergic reaction to the peppermint and became itchy all over. The other non-peppermint soaps are very good for giving your skin that clean feeling and washing makeup off.I also dilute the soap with water (4:1) into a spray bottle to remove grease in the kitchen or for washing hands (put solution into a foaming soap pump). This is a very versatile, powerful, and natural soap that I would highly recommend."
5,amazing soap,"We use this soap for everything. I mean everything. Hair, body, teeth, clothes, floors.. you name it. All natual and safe for everything except your eyes."
5,Still the best soap of all!,"I've been using Dr. Bronner's Peppermint Oil Soap for over forty years now and still swear by it. I just bought a gallon which lasts me around five years! I use it for washing body, face and my remaining hair. I even use it as a shaving soap. It lathers up beautifully with a badger brush and works great with a double edge razor.I kind of miss the ""tingle"" of the older version, but it still smells and does the job just as great."
5,Love It,"Love it! I purchased this as a gift for my mother, now every few months she asks for a new bottle!"
5,Great Product,"I love this product. The Peppermint scent didn't last as long as I would've like, but still a great product."
4,great product,"It is a great product. I use it with the foam soap dispenser, which offsets the high cost but does an incredible job. Found better price at a local store."
5,LOVE Dr. Bronner's!,"I LOVE this soap! I use it for shampoo, shaving, body wash/soap, laundry, cleaning, and hand soap. I bought foaming soap dispensers and it works great! For shampoo I use it full strength but I don't need much at all! I am happy that the ingredients are organic and I LOVE that I am supporting an AWESOME company! I have other Dr. Bronner's products (chapstick, leave in hair cream, hair conditioner, other scents of the Castile soaps) and I LOVE them ALL!"
5,Timeless Favorite,My husband has used nothing but Dr. Bronner's Peppermint liquid soap since I introduced him to it nearly 15 years ago. He refuses to use anything else.
3,Smells weird,"I guess I am addicted to fake, synthetic ""rose"" fragrance. I always like Dr. Bronners, but I won't buy this scent again."
5,BEST SOAP IN THE WORLD!!!!,You seriously havent lived till you come out fresh after showing in peppermint castile soap.Though dilute it first. It's strong!!!!A bottle this size lasts FOR-EVA!!!!!
5,Love Dr. Bronners,Dr. Bronners Magic Organic products are the best. I love the fresh clean feeling I get when using any of the products. Highly recommend.
2,Not as concentrated as other bottles,I received this product quickly but it seemed too dilute. I purchased another bottle from Target and confirmed. Still smells great though.
4,Gentle,"Overall, I love this soap. It does have a somewhat ""medicinal"" smell, but I might add some mint to soften it. If you are used to highly perfumed body wash, or if you aren't familiar with the smell of tea tree, you might prefer to try one of the other DB scents."
5,Best soap around.,All natural. Lathers up real nice with just a little. I feel clean the scent is awesome. I only buy gallons and save lots. Not as cheap as store soaps. However I can read the label.
5,Love Bronners Lavender Soap,"We've been buying this for a while and really like it. I've used it for face and body wash, even for shampoo (with an apple cider vinegar rinse afterwards, works really well in taming my curly hair). I use it for the kids, in foaming pumps for hand soap in the bathroom, and I've even used it in a pinch for an all-purpose cleaner or on gentle laundry (especially hand-wash wool items). I also like that it scores a 1 (low hazard) on the EWG Skin Deep database. I generally get mine on iHerb for pretty cheap being that I get a discount there (anyone can sign up for VIP membership for free) and they usually have free shipping (if you've never shopped on iherb, you can also get $5 off or $10 if you spend $40 using the coupon code MOS036). Last time I just bought a full gallon and I keep the house well stocked by refilling the smaller bottles. It DOES sting if you get it in your eyes, though. Otherwise, I'm a big fan. The lavender smells great."
5,"Works great, smells better!","Some things to know about this soap:-The peppermint scent is great! It is a little of the strong side, but if you dilute the soap this is not such a factor.-I dilute the soap (50% water, 50% soap), put it in a spray bottle, and use it to wash the dishes. Works great!-Also, I dilute the soap (50% water, 50% soap) and put it in a foaming soap dispenser/bottle to use as hand soap.-Even if you do not dilute the soap, it is not as thick as a typical liquid soap."
5,"Dr. Bronner's ""Magic Hemp Soaps"" All flavors","As a matter of performance, Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps are very hard to beat. They have been around for many years, at least 50, and they know what they are doing! It takes next to nothing to get enough soap to clean up so it lasts a long time. The usual dilution ration is about four parts water to one part soap for shampoo, but that's just me. Follow the instructions on the container. If your having problems with dandruff and other brands leave your scalp uncomfortable, try one of Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, it really is amazingly good. Make the effort to keep it out of your eyes though, it's old fashion and irritates the eyes - I can't speak for the baby version because I haven't tried that one, but I have used just about every other version they have offered over the years."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL,"As a novice vegetable gardener I purchased this soap to mix with water and cooking oil to use as an organic pesticide. Naturally after reading the reviews I wanted to see if it was worth all the hype. OMG! I'll NEVER bathe with anything else besides Dr.Bronner's Peppermint 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint Soap! My skin has never been so CLEAN and FRESH!! The smell and the tingling sensation only intensifies the experience, it's AMAZING! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! You won't be disappointed. You'll need a loofah to get it to lather due to it's lack of chemical lather boosters. I'm back to order more, this time adding the lavender soap as well!! Can't wait to try it on all the other suggested uses I've read about in the reviews here on Amazon."
3,Better than Dr Woods Products.,That's all I can say. Lathers better and is thicker Doc Woods. I will try another brand the next time I order. This was relatively inexpensive given how much I paid for the inferior Doc Woods product earlier.
1,Thin and watered down.,"I had just finished my bottle that I purchased at a retail store and opened this 32 ounce bottle to use today. I am beyond disappointed this this is a watered down version of Bronner's soaps! Unfortunately the window to request a return has elapsed, but I want to advise those who consider purchasing this soap from this vender to reconsider. I could have paid more locally and enjoyed the thick soap that I am used to."
3,Not my favorite,"I'm a huge fan of the almond oil soap, but figured I'd try the tea tree oil soap to see what it was like. I can't say I'd use it for daily use because it seems to be a little more harsh than the almond oil and the smell is a little strong. My skin feels drier when I use it and, sadly, reacts to this by becoming even more oily. It might work better if I diluted it even more, but so far it's been disappointing as a face wash.That said, it does work well when I've been working on the car and have grease and oil everywhere. It does a good job of breaking down the grease and cleaning up.I'd recommend the almond oil or peppermint before this as general use products. This may be more limited in what it cleans best."
5,"Great product, but CAUTION!","I really enjoy this soap, and I actually mix this with the peppermint version (love the sensation) in a single bottle. Usually fill it with 1/4th of the tea tree and the rest with the peppermint. However, this is a warning to everyone: DO NOT USE THIS OR ANY OTHER TEA TREE OIL PRODUCT AS TOOTH PASTE. Tee tree oil is a great antiseptic and cleanser but can be VERY hazardous to your health if, for any reason, it is taken into your mouth. I throw this warning out there because other Dr. Bronner's all-in-one soaps are advertised as being adequate toothpaste, but there is considerable research that shows Tee Tree Oil, while being organic and natural, is indeed hurtful towards your body if absorbed orally. It is completely safe outside the body, though, for skin cleaning and such. Just be cautious."
2,Unpleasantly Surprised,"I researched the hell out of Dr. Bronner's when I wanted a more natural shampoo/soap, and it received nothing but positive responses - so I bought it in Peppermint. The smell is lovely, but it DOES NOT wash my hair, though it is advertised as an 18-in-1 magic soap - shampoo included.Let me preface by saying I have VERY thick hair.The first time I noticed that it wasn't clean was while I was camping. After a shower, the back of my hair felt wet and heavy for WAY too long, so I checked it out in the bathroom, and it looked like my hair was greasy and filled with residue. At first I dismissed it based on the water pressure from camping.When I returned home, I used Dr. Bronner's on my hair two days in a row, taking special care to make sure my hair was completely rinsed. By the second day, my hair was gnarly and matted in the back.Unfortunately, even using this as a body wash makes my skin feel tight.I REALLY wanted to like this shampoo. I was hoping it would change my life."
1,Nobody's Fault Exactly,Product arrived with a faulty seal. Fragrance had dissipated. Only a vague resemblance to the quality I know and associate with Dr. Bronner. Nobody's fault. Things happen.
2,Never ever ever again...,"The fragrance is wonderful and I feel great that it's natural, but I hate this soap. First, it does not lather, no matter how much you use or rub. Second, it is so liquid that you can't really use it in a pump because when you pump it will spray out and make a mess. I just don't feel clean after using. There are too many better organic soaps out there. I never tried the other options for Dr. Bonner, so perhaps it's just lavendar.On the positive side, it does smell nice."
1,Made my psoriasis worse,"I've had psoriasis for a few years now, and recently discovered that the ingredients in the soap I was using could be making it worse, or even causing it. I promptly stopped using it and ordered this soap because it used all organic ingredients. For a week while I waited for my order to arrive I showered using water only, and after 3 days my psoriasis was completely gone. However, after 3 days of using this soap my psoriasis was back and worse than ever. I will not be ordering any more of this soap."
1,Dr. Bronner-Org Castile Soap Peppermint,"Despite all claims, I was not pleased with this product as a laundry soap. While it filled the laundry room with a wonderful aroma, it did a poor job of cleaning my clothes, leaving them dingy and dull."
4,OK Product but doesn't reserve 5 stars.,Good product and skin friendly. But doesn't have the luxury feel to it. I have used better soaps.
1,Didn't do the Trick,"I purchased this soap to help my dry skin problem, but it just didn't work. I still have to wash my hands and then apply a cream."
2,Gross residue,"I bought this product to help transition into a ""no poo"" routine. It worked well the first day but the second time I washed my hair with it my hair felt so dirty. The only way I can describe it is that it felt like I had gone swimming in a chlorinated pool. It wasn't greasy but it felt grimmy and was completely unmanageable which really doesn't help when you have to go to work. There is a light citrus scent so I am going to try and use it as a body wash and I will update my review if that works out well. Keeping my fingers crossed it doesn't make my skin feel like chlorine."
5,Great product!,"I have used this as a bath soap, but currently I use this to wash my hair and Neutragena Rainbath for body care.I change the particular soap that I use every few months in order that the body bacteria does not get to comfortable with a particular product.I have sensitive skin and this product definitely does NOT irritate my skin.In the past, I have reacted strongly to bar soaps I have used, generally with sneezing while in and immediately after a shower. However, I have NO such reaction with Dr. Bronner.I have dry skin. I would not consider this product to be one that dries you out.Because it has peppermint in it, you want to make sure that you don't get it in your eyes."
5,"Dr. Bronner - Organic Castile Soap, Peppermint","We started using this product years ago and don't plan on stopping. The trick is diluting it and using foam dispensers. The soap lasts a long time this way - our gallon has lasted over 3 years. We purchased Pampered Chef foam dispensers and use the measuring along the side. However, we also refill SoftSoap dispensers around the house. We also use it straight while backpacking since it can be used for any washing, including teeth. (However, we generally opt to toss in a small tube of toothpaste too since it isn't great as a toothpaste)"
5,Cheaper at Trader Joe's,"After ordering from Amazon, I realized this soap is cheaper at Trader Joe's. That said, our family has used this soap exclusively for years and it's great. A liter lasts just over a year for two people, too."
5,I love it!,I have nothing bad to say. I'm so pleased with the choice I made to use Dr. Bronner's castile soap.
5,Best Soap Ever!!,"I had recently been introduced to Dr. Bronner's line of soaps. Immediately upon use I knew I had struck gold. This product is really an all in one...I use it to shampoo, as a gel wash and a facial soap for shaving. I have also bathed my 3 dogs with this miracle soap. I usually don't get excited or write reviews for web sites but this product has certainly got my attention. Try it...there are several ""flavors"" of soap...Eucalyptus, Almond, Tea Tree, Peppermint and maybe 1 or 2 others. I have also used the bar soap with similar results.Its GOOD STUFF!!!"
3,opinion,"This product is indeed a watered down version of the soap. Still good soap but 1/5 as potent as same bought a year or so ago. Again, good soap, BUT why don't they mention less potent?"
3,"Instructions, please?","Just received this today. It seems fine diluted 4/1 as a hand soap, but that is the only way I have used it so far.I am totally stymied by all the ridiculous religous crap that is written all over the label IN PLACE OF directions for uses of and dilutions of this soap.Some might find this humorous or even inspiring (??); I find it annoying. I had to go online to get ideas about how to use this and how it should be diluted.It remains to be seen, after I have recovered from my initial crankiness, if I will be a real fan. So far, Dr. Bronner himself really turns me off!"
2,Insect soap,"Among organic gardeners all have great praise for this product. While using it at the recommended dilution, I had poor control of the insect named ""cabbage worm"" perhaps a stronger mixture applied more frequently is the solution."
5,Great for sinus relief,"So glad I purchased this soap! I discovered it does wonders for chronic sinus problems. Whenever I have a particularly bad sinus day, I use this soap when showering. It provides some much needed relief. Works best with a really hot shower."
5,Great Soap,As always I am very impressed with Dr. Bronner Soap. I believe I have tried every kind and every single one is good. This product is a 100% organic and natural. I recommend everyone try it. The soap goes a really long ways. I use a sponge (a few drops works good) and thats all you need. A bottle this size will last about 6 months at least if you use it just for bathing. Well good luck to all of you who try this product.
4,Good utility soap -- don't use on babies,I've used Dr. Bronner's soap for years. I find it refreshing. It's also a great utility soap -- I've even used it to rid my garden of an infestation of caterpillars!One warning -- do not use Dr. Bronner soaps on babies. It stings.
3,Nice scent...at first,"When I opened the container, the scent was a nice peppermint, like Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea. I tested it out by first washing my hands with it, and it smelled nice. However, the scent dissipated within seconds and was replaced by a generic soap scent, kinda like grandma's stock of cheap hotel soap. It cleaned great and got really nice and sudsy. The only fault I could find was that the nice scent faded quickly and then smelled like cheap soap. I'm curious if the citrus scent would fare better."
4,Super Soap!,"The lavender scented soap is wonderful. It is a little thin in consistancy, not like shower gel, but the lather is exceptional and a little goes a long way. I use it for showering and hand soap in foaming dispensers with a little water, and think it is the best for shaving. It doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry, and it has been great on sun burned or irritated skin. I tried it as shampoo and a face wash but that didn't work for me, it made my scalp and face feel tight (odd because it doesn't do that to the rest of my skin) and I didn't like the texture of my hair after shampooing."
4,Good Castile liquid soap-,"I decided to try this simply b/c I wanted to see what the rose soap was like. First it's not only Rose, but also hemp- thus the scent is not purely ""ROSE"". That being said, it is still a nice scent. The liquid is VERY thin in consistency, unlike another brand that I have tried. It is a Very good soap."
3,rats,"I thought I would love this, but it seemed watery to me. Left a film on the dishes, though it's supposed to be in addition to everything else a dish soap. I'm sure I will find ways to use this up, but I don't think I'll be back for another."
5,This is an all-time favorite of ours.,We have been using this soap for going on ten years now. It's such a great multi-tasker. We can use it for personal cleaning and for the household. It's awesome! The peppermint smells great!
5,Keeps the chicken skin away!,"I have Keratosis Pilaris and this is the only soap I use because it really helps keep my skin clearer. I'm not sure if is the lack of sulfates or the acid in the orange/tangerine essential oils, but I know my skin does so much better using this vs. standard soap. I usually add a couple drops of patchouli or ylang ylang to even out the citrus and it's yummy!"
4,dbsoap,Soap works well on most all common hand cleaning needs around our farm. But residual smell is not the most pleasing and could be better.
2,Good Natural Soap But Liquid Form is a Pain.,"I like the ingredients of this soap and it does get your hands clean but it's a pain to use in a soap dispenser. This stuff shoots out like a firehose in my Williams-Sonoma soap dispenser and then after awhile, it would clog up the dispenser pump. I tried diluting it but this didn't help much. I found it works best by just using it out of the container it comes in but then the lid gets all mucked up with soap residue. My recommendation is to go with Dr. Bronner soap bars instead."
3,"Nice smell, and it's effective.","I purchased this as an ingredient to a homemade multi-purpose cleaner, and also a possible ant-acne face wash. The smell and effectiveness were great for the cleaner, but the soap dried out my skin more than my moisturizer could handle, so I stopped using it. It would be interesting to try other types."
5,Great Organic soap,"i LOVE this product!! it has so many uses and is pure and good for the environment and it smells absolutely wonderful!! I use it as a hand wash, a pet shampoo,body wash...the possibilities are pretty much endless!"
5,So Pleased......................,I have used Dr.Bronner's Pure Castile Soap for a long time and I simply love it.I appreciate the item being shipped so quickly.
3,Smells good but not for me,I bought this soap because I thought I could use it in my laundry as I do the Castile Lavender version of this brand. It was highly rated and you got a big bottle of it for the price. Unfortunately when using for laundry it does not have as good a smell or last as long as the Lavender. So i tried using it for bathing and that was a mistake! It makes your skin feel ice cold like its freezing. It may be good for the summer and I will try it then but I used it this month and it just makes your body feel like your freezing. I also washed my hair and it seemed to strip any natural oils in your hair so you have to make sure to use conditioner. Overall I highly prefer the Lavender version of this brand so will not buy peppermint again.
4,Favorite Bronner's scent,"This is my favorite scent out of all of the Dr Bronner's scents. My only problem is that whenever I have a cut anywhere, the citrus in this soap stings me. I don't have this problem with the bar soap version. I usually have either the almond or lavender liquid soaps as well so that I can switch them out when this happens. Also, none of these works well as a shampoo so I wouldn't use it for that purpose."
5,The same excellent quality that you expect from Dr. Bronner's soaps,"I am using Dr. Bronner's castile soaps for quite a while now. I have almost stopped using commercial products that have dangerous and unnecessary chemicals in them. Most of the commercially available soaps clean the skin, but leave the skin dry. Dr. Bronner's castile soap, on the other hand, both cleans the skin, and leave it moisturized. Before this product, I was using Peppermint castile soap. I liked that it left my skin cool. I was curious to try another of Dr. Bronner's soaps. This soap has a very sweet smell of orange which I like. Moreover, it has the same excellent quality that you expect from Dr. Bronner's soaps. I really recommend it for castile soap users who want to try a new scent."
3,Don't care for the scent of this soap,"I must give credit for the quality of this soap however; I can't stand the scent. I am so disappointed. I expected it to smell ""refreshing"" but it reminds me of industrial cleaner instead of a body soap scent. As a kid the janitor at school used to sprinkle a Choloform dusting material on the floor before pushing it behind a big wide broom to clean the halls....the scent of this soap reminds me of that. I am sorry that I put faith into this and bought the 64 oz jug. My fault, I should have tried it out first in a small container. Looks like this will be used to bath the dogs, as a cleaner, etc. but not as a body soap."
2,Hard to use soap,I like the soap but it is a problem to dispense. It is always curing and dries and crusts up. In other words whatever pump dispenser you use will clog up and and clog up often.
3,okay,i was okay with this product. Wasnt what I expected. But you live and you learn and you dont but things that dont work again!
2,HATE IT,How can this oily crap ever get anything clean??? I purchased it because some lady on Pinterest said that if you put it on your dirty cookie sheets it will get them clean. Well she was wrong. I rubbed it on my pans until my arm was sore and they are still dirty and now they oily too. PASS ON THIS ONE.
2,Product is thin and watery,"This product seems quite different from the original peppermint Dr. Bronner's, which I have bought for about 40 years. It's watery, doesnt suds up, doesnt clean dishes very well. I wonder what's happened? Has the company changed its formula? I was pretty disappointed, but now that I'm warned, I'll buy it in a store where I can see how it behaves in the bottle, and check if it looks thin and watery."
1,Trauma Inducing!!!,"I had high hopes that this would work on my 4-year old daughter who suffers from eczema. However, as soon as I applied this soap she started screaming. Screaming like I have never heard!! Her entire back from her neck to ankles turned bright red. I couldn't get it off fast enough. It was upsetting for both of us and I feel just horrible for putting her through that. I ended up soaking her in an oatmeal bath and it seemed to help. I'm glad it has worked for some people, but definetly a NO for us!!!"
1,Ummmm....no thanks!,YUCK!! I did not like this product. To me - it smelled like an old barn. Others have liked it...I was hoping for something better.
1,bunk,"This soap sucks. I hate the scent, and it doesn't work . I also do not appreciate the religious writings on the bottle. I am not against religion, but I feel it is my choice and I resent it being 'shoved' at me on a commercial product."
5,Wonderful stuff,"I wash my face with it daily as well as use a drop on my toothbrush, no paste which has chemicals."
3,feel good soap,"This makes one feel better about using it rather than some other , but as far as cleaning I saw no difference."
4,Castille soap,Soap arrives from Amazon in a rather large clear container. It is for use in a case of psoriasis. The gentle applicaton via wash-cloth is the least irritating found to date. More definitive results will be possible when more time passes.
1,Made me Itch,"I purchased this yesterday. I've been itching and scratching all day at work. It made my skin really dry, much worse than soap. I would never recommendd this to anyone. I have no idea what these people are talking about, this stuff is awful. Years ago I had purchased the peppermint and it was just as bad. I've learned my lesson, won't buy any of Dr. Bronners products again."
5,HEMP SOAP!,Love the Bronners line of soaps. Citrus scent is very appealing. A little bit goes a long way even when using this for EVERYTHING. Amazon Prime prices are at par with or better than store prices.
2,Not my favorite scent,"I like Dr. Bonner's liquid soaps. I thought I'd try a new scent. The rose is my least favorite. I only use this soap as a last resort because frankly, it smells terrible."
5,Excellent product!,I use it for everything. I wash my hair and body with it. And I even clean the bathroom sink and wash dishes with it. A simply wonderful product!
5,Fills the Room with Fragrance,"I discovered this castile soap about 20 years ago at a local restaurant when I washed my hands in the ladies' room. I was struck by the clean, peppermint fragrance and asked what kind of soap they used and they told me ""Dr. Bonner's Peppermint Soap"". I looked for it at my local health food store and have been hooked ever since. Every time we have company at our home, visitors comment on the hand soap in the bathroom. It is gentle yet lathers well and leaves your skin feeling clean, but not dry. This product will make you feel like you're being extravagant, but is affordable enough to use every day!"
5,Best Soap Ever,"I've been using Dr. Bronner's soap for years. I searched for a long time before that to find the perfect peppermint soap, and this is it! I use it like bodywash for the most part, but sometimes I use it for shaving and it works wonderfully! It's also good when you want to get things clean without harsh chemicals. I have very sensitive skin but I've never had a reaction to the peppermint oils. Once I use up my soaps from a well-known soap and scents store, I'm going to replace them with Dr. Bronner's. It's about half as much per ounce!"
5,mild soap sensitive skin,as advertised and compared to the other variations of this soap this is mild and perfect for those who have very sensitive skin!!
3,"So, so soap :(","I purchased this product mainly because it was organic. The smell is what I expected, but it doesn't last long. I've used it as a shower gel and as laundry detergent. I must say that it's not all that it's cracked up to be. Doubt I will buy any again."
3,It arrived broken :/,"I love Bronner's soap.. I use it for everything and was grateful that Amazon provides it at such a discount compared to the store!I received this as a gift from my wishlist, and squealed at the sight of the package. However, it came with a broken cap. Normally, I would fault it to packaging or the mail service.. but there was a large piece of tape holding the cap down. Did the manufacturer attempt to cover up a broken cap?I'm still debating on whether to complain or not. I hope your bottle doesn't come broken and leaking!"
1,Does not lather well!,"Trying to be more health conscious with products I use, I purchased Dr. Bronners to use as my shampoo. Well, lets just say it lathers horribly for someone with thick hair. Will not purchase again."
1,Extremely poor packaging - bottle cap broke during shipment,Ordered two different bottles - both were improperly packaged. The contents of one bottle leaked out through the box and made a huge stain on my concrete front porch. The other bottle was shipped in a separate box - it also leaked due to a loose lid.
3,still on the fence,"i have tried using this product when hand washing dishes and i don't know if i am sold when it comes to greasy dishes. there still seems to be a film left on them. in other uses, i really like it. the smell is a little unpleasant."
5,Dr Bronner's Best,There is nothing like Dr Bronner's soap. I prefer the peppermint. You get a safe ultra-clean shower and an aromatherapy treatment at the same time. I have very sensitive skin and nothing is non-irritating to me but Dr. Bronner's.
5,Best Human Cleaner on Earth,The Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Peppermint Soap is an organically clean product that is great on my skin and on the environment. The natural ingredients in this product balances the natural oils in my skins.
5,Magic On Your Skin,This is hands down the BEST soap I have ever used. I love how it makes my skin feel. You'd like this soap its great
5,"Excellent Product, strong, clean fragrance","Although the bottle can be overwhelming with all the amount of text on it, the majority of it comes from the Bronner families message about the history of the company. I'm not sure the exact ratio, but it is absolutely necessary to dilute the product to avoid drying out your skin excessively. You can feel the difference when you wash with it the first time, your skin feels noticeably different, than washing with soaps that contain sodium laureth sulfate."
4,Love it,"Love the lavendar scent and the gentleness of the soap. I typically dilute it for hand soap in the bathroom, kitchen and some times for the hair."
5,"Beware of what's in your soap, shampoo & shave cream","I was very surprised to read the chemicals that are everyday personal items. I did an internet search and was floored. Methylparaben, Butylparaben, Sodium Laurel (Laureth) Sulfate...the list is huge...no wonder people are so sick.On the other hand, this soap has none of that. It smells great, they have a new customer!"
2,Not happy with my purchase,"I'm really not fond of the ""squeaky"" feel left on my skin after using this soap. It's very uncomfortable!!! I purchased it because I am having some skin problems with severe irritation. I thought the tea tree oil would help. Perhaps it will, but again, the feel of my skin after I use it isn't a feeling I'm pleased with."
2,I didn't get the hype,"I didn't understand why everyone was so excited about this soap. I bought it for the sole purpose of using as a hand soap. I couldn't find anywhere through the company an exact measurement for the dilution parts, but found it through other's recommendations on line. The dilution was 10 parts water to 1 part soap. That leaves me with water that smells like peppermint. It squirts everywhere out of the soap dispenser and is not even a tiny bit thick like normal soap. It also left a white film/residue in my sinks that were tough to clean out. I might be the only one, but I didn't ""get it"" on this soap. I sent mine back."
2,Disappointment,I have been using this product for eight years and my recent purchase has been the least concentrated of all. The product has been severely weakened both in smell and content. Please restore this product to its quintessential quality which we previously enjoyed and appreciated.
5,the best-smells great,"this smells amazing.... I use it as soap,bodywash,and shampoo. i have used the unscented and peppermint but this is by far the best. it smells sweet and almondy ...almost like a cookie. my skin felt great afterwards, i didnt see the part about the hemp just bought it for the almond but all i can smell is the almond so it doesnt matter. i would definitely recommend this."
2,Horrible product!!!,"I bought Br. Bronner'castile soap in 3 scents.After started using it,my skin became itchy and dull looking.Before using Dr. Bronner,we were using a different brand,just as healthy but in a bar.On top of my skin issues,I had to scrub my tub after each shower due to the awful residue that this soap was leaving.So,I decided to put it away until a few days ago when I found a dish liquid recipe calling for this soap.I made the soap and all I can say is that again this thing is awful.My dishes and my sink have the same residue as the tub.Love the lavender scent and the fact that is pretty natural,but that's about it."
4,Great de-greasser,"Smells nice, great de-greasser but not the miracle cure for baked-on gunk that other buyers said it was. Used it to clean deep fryer and it worked magic on the fish grease in that but when I tried to clean off the baked-on stains on my old aluminum cookie sheets it didn't really do much. I didn't dilute it, just used it straight. It sucked every single drop of oil out of my hands though so use with plastic gloves. I would probably buy it again."
4,No seal.,"When I received my peppermint 8oz bottle, there was no seal. Maybe it was normal. But then I received a bottle of baby mild 8oz from a different company here on Amazon, and it had a protective seal inside the cap. If it doesn't have a protective seal once it leaves the production line, then it will not get a perfect review from my opinion. If it was the retailer's fault, well, who knows."
5,FANTASTIC No-nonsense organic soap that is also interesting bath reading :),"This soap has SUCH a wonderful scent. The peppermint wakes you right up in the morning and gets you ready to go! I love the scent and the wonderful tingle it leaves on your skin. I especially love it in the summer when it hot outside. Getting in the shower and feeling that cool tingle is just refreshing. It will probably be the only soap I will ever buy again. A 16-ounce bottle of this stuff is a little pricey but it lasts months longer than any of the commercial soaps out there. You only need a TINY bit to get a good lather.Also, the bottle is very interesting reading if you take long showers/baths. I can't say I understand the majority of it but its something to read :)"
5,"great soap, good price",a great multi purpose soap that can be used at home or when camping without worrying about environmental effects since it's biodegradeable. love the pepermint smell to wake up in the morning.
4,Great Product. Tricky Shipment.,"Dr. Bronner's is by far the BEST soap. Ever. Best. However, it's tricky to ship a gallon of it ... be prepared for leaks. Multiple attempts to deliver. But, the sender's were apologetic and prompt to send a replacement. Once you get it, it'll last for several months and well worth it!"
4,you Can't go Wrong,"you can't go wrong with Bronner's soap. I ordered this as a present for someone and the only negative was that the peppermint was a little too strong for some skin types in certain areas, so be careful! Otherwise I love bronner's soaps."
2,50/50,"Ok, so I'm on the fence with the stuff, yes it leaves your body squeaky clean. But I tried it as a shampoo and omg...the tangles were endless. My hair is SUPER thick and long and I figured this stuff would leave it light and easy to work with..NOPE. I got out of the shower after using this, then a good moisturizing shampoo, and then a conditioner and my hair felt really weird.. like it almost had this wax feeling to it. I literally sat in my bathroom trying to brush the tangles out for a WHOLE HOUR. It was terrible. So if you're planning to get this stuff, just know that it IS good for body wash, laundry soap, cleaner. etc... BUT DO NOT PUT IT IN YOUR HAIR."
5,Very good quality,"I absolutely adore this soap. I switched to it because it much better then all that petroleum based stuff. I use it as hand soap, dish soap, laundry soap, shower gel and even when I shave i use it. It is great. I don't recommend to wash your hair with it, makes my hair very dry."
3,Works,What can one say.. It is caulking and it works when you follow the directions. Must let it set for time it tells you to.
4,VERY hot but bonds really well,"This glue gun works better than the three I've had in the past and I think it's because it gets so hot, the glue stays sticky longer and has a chance to really bond things together. But there's a downside to this if you're not really careful. I was making a wreath with this glue gun today. I had glued an item to the frame and waited for what seemed like ample time--probably 30 seconds or so--before picking up the frame under the spot where I had just applied glue. Some glue got on my finger and burned it to the point of blistering. Just be really careful if you're not used to using a glue gun that can get as hot as this one does.Also, the little plastic stand is pretty lame; it folds back in about 8 out of 10 times when I set the gun down after glueing something.But I'm giving this glue gun four stars because stuff really does together when I use it!"
1,broke first use,I bought this based on the price and I have good success with Stanley products in the past. This gun is a piece of junk and the trigger mechanism broke during the first use. I ended up getting the Arrow at a hardware store and even though it does not have the best reviews on here the Arrow is a much sturdier construction and made in the USA
3,ordinary glue gun,There's nothing good or bad about this. It works but it does drip. The stand is a good thing to have.
1,Beware,I bought this glue gun and an extra package of glue sticks. The gun will not feed the glue sticks and the instructions say not to try to remove them or it will damage the unit. I tried to file a claim for a defective unit but that requires that you return the unit. I no longer have the original shipping box. I'm out over $17.
2,Did not Like it,"It heats up and melts the glue, but it goes through it so quickly! You want to be prepared ahead of time, because when this thing heats up the glue stick disappears extremely fast! There is a lot of waste."
2,"Very sturdy, but not so easy to use","This glue gun is pretty sturdy and has nice thick glue sticks. The problem is you need to have a warrior hand to operate it. The button to be pressed would get so stiff my hand was getting a work out. I found it a bit clunky to work on my craft projects. Particular for finer work. Theres just not enough flexiblity to be had with this glue gun. Also the glue would not come out at times. I would have to place it on its stand, for a few minutes, then use it. As a doll crafter I want to keep going. Just like other crafters. I am keeping the gun for big repairs. But I find a mini gun is just better and easier for the kind of work that I do."
5,USED FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST NIGHT,Great glue gun. Just the right size (not one of those tiny craft guns). It gets hot enough to use in about 8 minutes. One thing I would recommend is do not touch the plastic portion forward of the trigger. It gets very warm as well. Worked like a top!!
3,Drippy,This gun heats nicely but drips constantly and is rather hard to clean up after. The stand is really useless.
3,First Two Films to Feature Martin & Lewis,"MY FRIEND IRMA was a radio series in the 1940's and legendary Hollywood producer Hal Wallis thought the film version would be a great vehicle for up-and-coming talents Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. The film was so successful that in 1950 Irma went West, with Dean and Jerry along for the ride. This launched the comedy duo into stardom and before the year was out they were headlining their own film (""At War with the Army"").Although these films are not Dean or Jerry's best work(s) I am excited about this double feature because I hope more of their great films (as a team and as individuals) will be released, we still need: ""Sailor Beware"", ""That's My Boy"", ""Visit to a Small Planet"", ""The Geisha Boy"", ""Some Came Running"", ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"", and ""Who's Minding the Store"", ""Which Way to the Front"", ""Hardly Working"", ""Cracking Up"", and ""Three on a Couch"" on DVD."
4,My Friend Irma,"Great Christmas gift, my Uncle Peter really enjoyed going back in time. Amazon has such a great selection to choose from."
3,Coverage,"This is an interesting record - some covers are good, some bands take their own interpretations on the songs, and some really stink (in both talent and recording quality). It was hard for me to buy this because it wasn't approved by the Descendents/Bill Stevenson (I found it used for under $4 and that was a major influence in the purchasing decision), but it is a pretty cool album to have for big Descendents fans and extreme music nerds (ahem). It's all pre-Everything Sucks songs, so it's their best stuff, at least in my opinion."
5,Perfect Size,"If the dimensions throw you off let me tell you. A great base width, perfect length and perfect height. I was afraid it would be too tall but it was just right for a large tool bag to keep in the car!"
1,Not Worth the Paper it is Printed On,"This has possibly been the single most unreadable thing I have ever had the extreme displeasure of reading. Weather or not you like/love this book is completely irrelevant. This version is not even worth lighting on fire to keep yourself alive.The type is completely illegible, words are horribly, horribly misspelled, and there are things such as: ""......;:!?vvvvvvvvvva gh"". What the hell does that say? Is that even legible words? How can you charge money for this?If I could rate this 0 stars I would. Jeez, I think they should have to pay ME to take this book from them. Not that I would take it, they would need to give me a LOT more than $30 for this hunk of illegible crap."
1,Drivel in Excess,"I purchased this book under the misapprehension that it might be similar to Jane Austen's work. Unfortunately, I was EXCESSIVELY mistaken! There was no depth of character or maturity found within this book. The sentence structure was often incomplete making it almost impossible to understand what the author was trying to express. The Characters had no soul. They were mindless caricatures fulfilling wanton lusts and desire without reason. Who but a madwoman would swoon at the sight of her intended conquest on the arm of another woman-then pull her own hair out and tear at her own face. You may enjoy such as this,but I do not! This one needs to be filed under ""T"" for Trashola!"
4,Pretty Good,"The Best Of M2M is a great choice. It has its good things and its bad things. Like the title says, it has the best songs of M2M and it has 3 new songs and some new versions of old songs. The only bad thing is that it doesn't have some of their best songs like Sometimes, Miss Popular or Don't Mess With My Love. But it has its interesting things like videos. The new versions of Everything, Everything You Do, Jennifer and Love Left For Me are really good. And if you are a a big fan of M2M, you have to listen to Not To Me, Is You and Wait For Me. A must have for every M2M fan and if you want to get to know them, it's the best choice."
2,NO GOOD,"Buy the first CD, this one is garbage, for a winner from dead prez, you gotz to get the first one!!!!"
1,THE MESSAGE...,"... here is we dont want no more prisons, let people [commit crimes] the world over becuase everything is racist and everyone is against us.... WT...?????!!!!!!i wonder what dead prez would think of abolishing prisons if somebody was killing their mothers?"
4,Great idea but flawed,"This is a great product and toy for children- even I enjoyed it as a parent, However, the coloring paint is thin and doesn't paint on smoothe. I had to but a different set of paints from the store so you could see the color and/or eliminate stripes."
1,NEVER GET THIS TOY!,"My sister recived this toy for a birthday present. A couple days later we started doing the craft and it is JUNK. I can't tell you how much you should not buy this toy it is a waste of money and the paint starts pealing off an hour after you paint it, and you can't even see the paint. Never Get This Toy. We just wanted to warn you!!!"
5,american pops,i got the american pops with ''BUGLER'S HOLIDAY'' . IT WAS GREAT !!! AND I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME. THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR PROMPT REPLY!!
5,Who likes ghosts?,"I expected not to like this (not sure why) but I am hooked. The one nice thing about this series vs other programs like this....it has multiple stories in each episode. So I know if I only have about 15 minutes or so of ""free time"" I can squeeze in at least one story before I have to head out. The stories are good & believable. I also highly recommend ""A Haunting"" & ""The Haunted"""
4,Ghost,I love it. Its just like the TV version but without commercials. Two thumbs up and I recommend it to everybody
3,Entertaining but fake,"These type of shows get more bold as the trend becomes more popular. If you could really film these type of events it would change the world as we know it. It would represent true proof of the paranormal that would generate massive investigation and attention. Sorry guys and gals, it's fake."
5,"Bravo-a, Bardina!","""Bardina's Forest"" isn't for everyone. But it oughta be. Deceptively simple, this is music for the soul--nurturing, delightfully playful, spiritual, and just plain beautiful. Easy to hear music, but it doesn't shout at you. Rather it invites you in. Stephanie Bennett's harp sings to you, even as she does as Bardolina. But the message is the medium. Stories of hope, love, dreams, caring, all the things that matter, recounted with charm and panache, as she accompanies her harp. If you know any children over, say 4 or 5, I recommend that you give them this CD. Not only will they like the music, they will be hearing--and understanding beautiful messages, about the planets, loving animals, the treasure of imagination, and dreams. An added bonus: Stephanies inciteful understanding of Beethoven's ""Pathetique."" Beautiful playing, she touches your soul."
5,One of the most sadly overlooked records of all time,"I agree with what other reviewers have said here, but think it's worth adding that not only are there some amazing songs on this record, but the band behind Connelly is awesome too. Martin Atkins is brutally good on drums and Chris Bruce adds some of the coolest guitar playing I have ever heard."
5,What the other guy said.,"The other guy's review works well enough here, I just thought I'd be a nice guy about the fact that a lot of people are looking for this album without knowing it, exactly. On the latest Pigface tour, Chris Connelly started the set solo with an acoustic guitar. If you've gotten this far looking for that first song, then yes, this is the album. (If you weren't there, it sounded incredible.)"
5,Hypnotizing,"This is one of those books,I find myself looking forward to reading because it is so good. At work this book was what I thought about most of time. I found myself working faster,just so I could read it. This is a really great book,with a wonderful story line. However the author seems to drag things just a bit and that got annoying"
4,The Horse Goddess -- Llewelyn,"The book was a gift to my daughter,who had requested it. She hasn't had time to read much of it yet, but am sure she will love it. Guessing 4-5 stars. We've both read other books by this author."
4,Was this the first book in a series?,"The reason I ask is that when I finished it, I got the feeling that I missed something. It seemed like the author was setting up storylines and plotpoints along the way that could be fleshed out in another book. But don't get me wrong, it was a good read."
2,Beware,"Since finding Bard, I'll read anything Llywelyn writes, including this book I found with a gold cover trying to sell itself as a romance novel (ugh). It wasn't, thankfully, but it seems an early work. The historical information in the novel was, I am sure, up to par with her other works, but the story itself was pretty shallow, staged, and craftless. Not my favorite."
5,My Daughter,Marie Harris's book took my heart. I can relate to Manny through my own adopted daughter who is now 10 and has been living with us only 15 months. Love is not always the whole answer but children like Manny and my daughter change the world around them for the better. I have read many books on adopting the older child but Marie's presentation is so beautiful her story will appeal on many levels.
3,"Not bad, but not what I expected","The three novelettes in this collection were interesting, okay, not terrible. But they weren't what I was expecting, and I have no earthly idea why the volume was titled ""Stolen Memories"" -- I'd been hoping for some fun amnesia plots, but no. JAK's story was okay but not her best (and I'm sure I've read it before). Tess Gerritsen's story was the most engaging, to me -- an action adventure romp involving a gentleman and a thief. Stella Cameron's story was sadly dated, however -- a subplot dealt with a character possibly losing his medical license due to a rumor that he was gay. Possibly a very hot topic in 1985, when it was originally published, but rather bizarre now.These were hardly the worst romances I've ever read ... but neither did they approach the best."
3,Not what I expected..,"I thought this would be a book that would be fun to read but I really only enjoyed the second one, the first and last werent really that great, but I had to give three stars only because I thought the second one was really good."
5,better than the best,"this is the best KMFDM cd...to me anyways...the songs are great, its funny and dark...so go buy it now cuz you wont be disapointed"
3,A CLASSIC BUT DEFINITELY NOT A MASTERPIECE IMHO.,"First, I should put it clear: I'm not a KMFDM fan; I like some of their songs a lot ('Anarchy', 'Light', 'Stary Bullet'...) I bought this cd after listening to 'Light' which is a very good indistrial song combining guitars and electronics with quality, very danceable and with pretty female chorus. But I got disappointed by the rest of the album; It is interesting to see how KMFDM moved from a classic EBM sound in the vein of 242 in 'Don't Blow Your Top' to an industrial, being one of the first in adding guitars and breaking that absurd opposition guitas vs electronics. But the songs here lack, in my opinion, the genius of Skinny Puppy, 242 or NIN; 'A Drug against war' and 'A Hole In The Wall' are quite bad songs for me; they are boring and very little electronics in them. 'The problem', sung by a female voice, is quite an interesting song, but on the whole i consider it a mediocre cd from a mediocre (as a whole) band."
4,Carolina Coast,This novel concerns how Nick Stefanos became a detective after being terminated as an administrator of an electronics product retail firm. Excellent work and catching a moving train is quite descriptive.
3,Gritty mystery transforms retail clerk into a detective,Street-wise mystery in Washington DC that involves a retail clerk turned corporate type who is drawn into a missing person foray. Often gritty in descriptions and focuses on day to day excesses of everyday people.
3,Yawn,"This was my first Pelecanos book, and it will also be my last. I cannot understand why he is considered such a hot author. I didn't like the main character, or any of the other characters for that matter, and frankly, the book was a bore. In addition, I found it fairly implausible, which for me is always a turnoff. Perhaps I am being a bit generous in giving it three stars."
3,Better Pelecanos To Be Found Elsewhere,"Although the first of the Nick Stefano books, I read this one after the other two (Nick's Trip and Down By the River Where the Dead Men Go), and it's probably a good thing I did too. I probably never would have continued on through the series if I had have read this one first. It is easily the weakest of the Stefano books. It lacks direction for a good 90% of the book and only really starts to hot up for the finale and the reveals. Like the other books, Nick Stefano and his friends indulge in mind-blowing quantities of both alcohol and marijuana. Unfortunately, the focus was mostly on these excesses rather than trying to solve the problem at hand, which was to find a former co-worker who appeared to have been kidnapped.For completeness sake, by all means read this book, but really, it isn't necessary before going on to the next in the series, Nick's Trip, which I felt was a more enjoyable and entertaining story."
4,Destiny's Child they ain't,"Mis-Teeq may be an all girl trio with an R&B sound, but they are a far cry from Beyonce, Michelle, and Kelly, the popular trio called Destiny's Child who split to go solo career-wise after multi-platinum records.Mis-Teeq debuts with a sizzling single, SCANDALOUS, sure to be a top 10 summer hit. Why? The lyrics are fun to sing along with. The beat is incredibly and irresistibly danceable and the words will stick in your mind all day! The girls sound different from past successes like the already mentioned DC, as well as TLC, though I could understand a bit of their influences in Mis-Teeq's music. Each member has her own unique sound. This beat will get you dancing - whenever I'm in the car and the Philly stations play it, which they do quite a bit, I can't suppress the urge to pump up the volume 'till it's blaring.The bottom line is, these girls are something new and America's music industry needs that - along with an ideal club song!"
3,luke warm remixes of a hot song.,"Well, there's really nothing special here. The best version is the sexy original single version. 5 mixes, including, 1) single version 2) blacksmith remix 3) jazzward remix 4) rudeness vocal remix 5) bermudez & griffin stained blue dress mix. Tracks 2&3 are ok R&B/hip hop remixes, still not better than the original. Track 4 is a soulful house mix that just bored me. And if you're looking for a nice hardhouse version that retains the attitude of the original mix, the best you're going to get is Track 5. Hard edged remixes are a dime a dozen these days as the market gets oversaturated and the record companies try to just rush mixes out to the market, and this one is is one of the dozen. It's not bad, but it doesn't take the song to any club peak hour anthem level or anything. The club scene seems to really need a face lift."
4,5 stars would be no need for contraception,"The only disadvantage I can think of for this one is the fact that sometimes there is a little foamy leakage. I planned ahead one day and grabbed one early, so that when the kids went to sleep we would be ready. In the course of the afternoon, I was busy doing standard domestic stuff--dishes, cooking, chasing a 3 year old and two other children, not to mention walking the dog-- there was a certain amount of leakage from the spermacide. Perhaps I accidentally used too much water or something, but it was a one time issue.Hubby said order more, he loves them, said he doesn't even know they are there. I couldn't say on the oral, we haven't done that with these, and we don't risk relying on them on the actual day of ovulation, but overall, I have to say, wonderful product, no risk, no problems, comfortable, easy to insert and remove. Also no need to watch the clock to see when that narrow window is like you have with films, foams, and jellies."
1,A Terrible Experience,"I got this product on recommendation of my gynecologist, as a back-up method. She also showed me how to use it. I used the sponge properly and not only did it get stuck, but after following all the directions in the information sheet about how to remove it, it ripped apart as I was trying to get it out. My boyfriend had no luck either, and the entire ordeal was awful for both of us. I ended up going to an emergency clinic (because we were out of the country) to have it removed. When it came out it was torn in several places. The gynocologist who removed it for me (with some difficulty) said she's seen them get stuck before but never tear. I then developed an infection because not all of the pieces came out. One came out over a 2 weeks later when I got my period.I had wished this would be a great back-up method or primary method some day but I'll never try it again."
1,highway robbery,"I used the sponge back when it first hit the market and loved it. Needless to say, I was ECSTATIC when it came back on the market and i'm a quite ticked that it's scarce again (and, yes, i've been running around like elaine in seinfeld, hoarding whatever i can find at the regular price on the shelves ... which are now, SADLY, empty). Here's my rant ... I find it VERY odd that the company who made the deal to take over from allendale pharmaceuticals retooled the packaging to appeal to a younger market but has recently filed for reorganization under Chapter 11. And NOW, when we're sent to links to buy the sponges online in the US, we're asked to pay varying exhorbitant prices including $130 for a box of 12 that used to cost $35!!!!????? (Price of three online - $43/ on the shelf - $10; Price of 6 online - $75/ on the shelf $16) Like the rising cost of gas, THIS ALSO ""SMELLS"" .... AND ... can you say ..... SCALPING? Something just doesn't seem kosher."
1,Not worth it,"My poor GF just took 30 minutes to get this terrible product out. She's been moaning away in the bathroom for all that time while I hunted around in the kitchen for some sort of tool that would get up there for us. Maybe she's got an extra deep cervix. Maybe you do too. I would think about that before putting this thing up there with the clock ticking to get it out again before it turns into a pumpkin or whatever at the 30 hour mark. Terrible product. If anyone wants to buy three, we've got most of a box left. They will be in the alley behind out house. You can stop by anytime to pick them up."
1,Not worth it,"This may seem like a great alternative for men who are reluctant to use condoms, but you should exercise caution. For one, this does not protect you from STDs. Just have to throw that out there. But if you have a steady partner, it's not great either. If you have had children, the rate of protection goes down SIGNIFICANTLY - to the point where it does not feel like it is a safe option, even if it is just for birth control. And last - and the strongest reason I can think of not to use it, is the spermicide is a bit numbing, for both men and women. And if there is oral sex involved in your fun, then there is this highly unpleasant numbness for the mouth. There are far more effective options out there. Skip this one."
2,You said Common Sense?,"This was a disappointing buy to me. Common sense is a large topic and this book didn't give me what I was expecting from it.The matters are treated in a too slim way, and games analysis are from openings we usually do not see any more. A large subject but a small treatment. But maybe I just didn't understand it?"
4,Uncommon Story,A well-written account by a Southern journalist who was there of a time in history and one uncommonly gifted lawyer's often underrated pace through it.
3,This book can be used as a great introduction to friendship,"Although the pictures are simplistic, the message in the book can be expanded in several ways. The dragon discovers what happens when you show off to your friends. He learns how to make friends again with the animlas by using his special talent- breathing hot air. Overall, The Popcorn Dragon is a light hearted book with a super message. It would be a great addition to any library."
1,Bad Lesson For Kids,"I read this way back in 1st Grade, age 6. I would NOT give this book to a child because it has an unfair message. It teaches kdis that you should never display your special talents because that's ""showing off"" and it'll make people not like you. So in a nutshell, the lesson of the book is ""when you show people what you can do, you're bad, and deserve ostracism""."
3,"Nice chair, too pricey.",I am happy with the chair. It sits nice and has plenty of adjustments. For $300 it should be more solidly constructed I feel. The armrests feel cheap and I suspect may break easily. A good chair but the price is more than I feel it should be.
2,Flimsy Zipper,"A ""luxe"" product should have better zippers. It could not stand up to the vigorous kicking of my 5 month old. The zipper broke."
2,"Its ok, but not necessary","I bought this while I was pregnant thinking it was cute and practical. My daughter is 6 months old now and I've still never used it. Its cute and soft, but thats about all. Its just a impulse buy. Swaddling your baby is just as cute, but safer."
5,BEAUTIFUL,"One of the most beautiful collections of music I own. It is so compelling--you feel nature inside of you, weaving through your soul. Close your eyes, and you are where the music takes you."
4,AT&T -- just short of greatness,"Leave it to AT&T to stop just short of greatness.This is almost the perfect caller ID box -- tons of features, easy to use, understated design -- the big flaw? It doesn't light up! When a call comes in, you have to strain to read the black letters and numbers against the dark gray background!Listen up, AT&T -- for a couple of pennies more, you could have made a perfect Caller ID box!"
2,This thing zapped my phone lines!!,"I was excited to receive the 2 units I bought but the day after I connected them, all my phonelines went dead. After three days of waiting for the phone company to come out to the house, they tested everything and said it was one of the caller id units that was causing a short in our lines. We couldn't even use the product and it caused a great deal of inconvenience. Very disappointed."
4,Very good sequel to Godfather,"This is a very good read. It delves into Hollywood and the mob to a level equivelant to the Godfather. Ofcourse, it couldn't possible match the Godfather, the ""Godfather"" of all mafia books, but it is a great second episode. If you liked the Godfather, this is a definate read!"
4,"Great Read, but ending seemed a little weak!","The Last Don was a great book. The character development was wonderful. I found myself hating Dante and pulling for Pippi and Cross. I thought that Puzo did a good job of creating the conflict between Dante and Cross. The way he wrote it, you feel that you almost have to pull for Cross. I do wish that Puzo would have developed Don Clericuzio a little better, but Cross was the main character. I thought the ending was a little weak too. I thought that it was clever, but I feel like it was almost rushed. I think it is a great book to invest some time into."
2,The GodFather it ain't!,"After reading the Godfather, I felt another Mafioso story from Puzo would be fantastico, but it was unbelievably boring! I was considering dumping it halfway through the book, but I stuck with it. It doesn't get any better - there is hardly any action only a couple of interesting plots. Apart from that, it is pure money & sex - a Jackie Collins novel with a Mafia family here and there.If you are looking for a good Mafia book, stay away from this offering from Puzo.Re-read The Godfather!"
3,NOT THE GODFATHER.,"A great insight into the modern mob. A good book, a little too detailed and slow in parts. It did not have all the blood and guts that i was expecting, nor did i find myselfoverly attached to any of the characters. Mario Puzo has tremendous insight and knowledge into Las Vegas, the movie industry and the mob. This book is slated to be a mini-series on cbs in may. my prediction, one of the most successful and highest rated of all time."
2,Major disappointment,"Having loved the Godfather, I have continued to read each book written by Mario Puzo and I have continued to be disappointed. The pre-publication hype for The Last Don, saying that Puzo was getting back to what he knows best, again made me hopeful. However, the new book can't hold a candle to the Godfather. I guess Mario only had one book in him. Still, I probably be in line when the movie opens"
2,Pales in comparison with The Godfather,"Every gangster story written by Mario Puzo would probably be compared to The Godfather which is an all time classic. This comparison may not be fair, but since I read The Last Don immediately after reading The Godfather, I cant help but compare the two. Compared to The Godfather, this book is a meandering and contrived story that failed to arouse my enthusiasm. The ending is predictable and the book gets more boring as the story develops. I would not recommend this book unless you are a Puzo fan."
1,LOOONG TEDIUS READ,"This book seemed like it took forever to read.I bought this book because it claimed to expose the underside of movie making and Las Vegas. There were probably 5 pages all together about runnig a casino and what goes on behind the scenes in Hollywood.The story itself was very lame. The mafia in this book was just so unbelievably omnipotent. The love interest was also entirely too perfect.The storytelling method used in this book got old very early. A major plotpoint would happen and one important point would obviously be left out and not addressed for hundred of pages later. An example of this is when the ""hero's"" father was killed, and the killer was expected by the father and the father even talked to the killer but we are not let in on him for several hundred pages. While this was supposed to make for nail biting suspense I just found it annoying as hell.Do not waste your time or money on this book, if you must watch the tv movie instead."
2,Soap opera about mob,"I love ""The Godfather"" movies, so I decided to give this one a shot. I'm sure now - those movies are great only beacause Coppola directed them.Puzo is an average writer. He knows who to tell the story fluently and that just about wraps it up. Everything else in this book stinks - annoying larger-then-life characthers, bad dialogues and predictable plot. After reading 1/4 of a book I knew what will happen at the end, and I am no Einstein, I admit.Soap opera about mob, is my definition of this novel. Easy to read, beyond belive and sometimes irritating."
2,"I paid for it, so I felt obligated.","Quite frankly, this book was not very good. I like fictionthat's at least somewhat intellectual and interesting, thisbook was neither. Its filled with cheesey, predictablecharacters that bumble through a uninspired soap opera plotand gratuitious sex scenes. There are a lot of semi-interestingcharacters, but many of them are of no use to the story atall. Oh well, the author should make a pretty penny fromthe movie rights, but this book is no 'Bankable Star'."
1,Are there two Mario Puzos?,"I read The Godfather in 1971--in high school--and loved it. I haven't read it since (yet), but I'll be surprised if my opinion will have changed when I do. Most of the books I loved then still hold up to a more mature re-reading. So what is with everything else Mario Puzo has written? I tried The Sicilian and thought it was laughable--something early he unearthed for his publisher when fame struck. I tried The Fortunate Pilgrim, after reading glowing reviews about his true ""masterpiece."" I thought it was pretentious and boring. Then this book--it reads like a novel written after a teleplay to capture a miniseries audience of non-readers. Don't bother--it's not even any fun."
2,A slow read,"This was my first Puzo book. I was expecting an entertaining read. Instead, I found the book to be a confusing chain of family dramas involving numerous un-engaging characters, plodding towards a conclusion that was less than exciting. Paricularly annoying were the in-depth, opinionated (introspective?) analysis of the world of hollywood film making.Maybe the choppiness and numerous twists and mini-dramas is just the nature of mafia stories. Maybe I am just reading the wrong genre. Because the only real thrill I got was upon completion of this book."
2,tired and worn story line,this is the same old theme that Puzo is stuck on: a mafia family trying to go straight. Characters are unrealistic and as always larger than life. Unimpressive book.
2,this book sleeps with the fishes,"when i started this book i expected a good mafia story with good characters and a good plot,but all i got was a pretty weak story with fake characters.i mean a made guy named cross who as the main character didnt work for me.also he was too young.another character that didnt fit was a cousin of cross who wore all kinds of funny hats cause he thought he looked cool.i dont recommend this book if your looking for a mafia read.i highly recommend the nonfiction book.""the last mafioso"" by ovid demaris."
2,A badly written book,"This is a very poorly written book. If you have read the Godfather, you will be horribly disappointed. There are some good points about how casinos are run and Hollywood but all the characters in this book are so hollow by the end of the book you don't care if they all get wiped out."
1,This is probably the worst book I have ever read,"I am surprised that I actually completed this nearly 500 page, albeit mostly filler, mess of a novel. The characters and plot are unbelievable even within a romanticized version of organized crime. A total waste of time."
3,Average,"I (like many) am a huge fan of The Godfather, both the first two movies and Puzo's book, so when I found a copy of ""The Last Don"" for a couple of bucks I thought I was in for a real treat. While, this book is worth a read if you enjoy Mafia books, it really just can't compare with The Godfather. In all honesty, this book really is simply average."
3,Probably was the first draft of the Godfather,"Comparisons to THE Godfather were inevitable. That was a classic , both in the literary and cinematographic sense. THE Last Don however is sort of not bad...but fairly predictable."
4,Great Mafia Book by Puzo,"This is the first Mario Puzo book I've read - and I know I'll read more of his! I thought it a great read every step of the way. Although long, every page/chapter moves nicely and it doesn't slow down. This book reminded me of a Sidney Shelton book (or maybe Jackie Collins' Lucky series.) Mario does a great job of detailing the hierarchy in the mafia and the powerplays that go on. Also, this is an epic in the sense it covers many years and many locations (NY, Las Vegas, LA). He intermingles the gambling establishment with Hollywood and the mafia - which makes for an interesting combination of corruption. A fascinating book!"
3,Guilty Pleasure,"God help me, but I can't stop reading this book eventhough I know it is mediocre at best. It is a lot of fun, but nothing to be proud of. The names are a great source of unintentional humor, though! ""Athena Aquitaine""?? Come on, Mario"
2,Disappointing. Unconvincing. Self-imitation.,"I've read and reread ""The Godfather"" and enjoyed it everytime. I'm sorry to say I found ""The Last Don"" weak andunconvincing. I even at times start to wonder if the Mafia lingo is real or if he's making it up. Early in the book, he says killing where the body is intended to be found are ""confirmations,"" ones where it is intended not to be found are ""communions."" Then, throughout the book, over and over, whenever a killing is contemplated someone says something about whether it's to be ""a communion or a confirmation."" Maybe we're to assume this is Clericuzio family language, not shared by other Mafia families? Reads like Puzo is imitating Richard Condon imitating Puzo."
4,"Movies, murders, and mobs, oh my!","Mario Puzo, the author of the Godfather, reproduces the organized crime formula is this great read. Though the plot is not exceptional, Puzo's writing is very fluid and exciting.The major strength of this book is its readability. The book moves along in a nice pace, with lots of action and dialogue. The characters are also unique and intriguing. Included are the mysteriousness of the mob and their family values, and the ruthlessness of Hollywood, which makes this book a fun weekend read.The one weakness is that the plot is lacking. The main conflict between the two cousins only comes to light near the end of the book. Though the side plots are interesting, the combination of it all makes it a weak overall story at best.All in all, I would recommend this book as one of those books to read on a lazy day right next to the pool or on the beach."
4,"I really liked it , but not as good as the Godfather","This was a good book , i loved the plot between rose marie and her family. I at times i found the love story distracting from the potenial of a good page turner. Even though i was still kept on my feet. Cross is so cool and , I kinda fall in ,love dante the villian he's so cool. i would recommend this to anyone who wants to be surprised at all times!"
2,Tolerable if you're in an airplane and REALLY bored!,"The Last Don by Mario Puzo is typical Puzo. His big bestseller, The Godfather, was gripping once you had seen the film, but the truth is that Puzo's style is clumsy. His sentences are unwieldy and boorishly contructed, as if he were a foreigner. I could wipe my arse with the plot, which is, to say the least, terrible. The story doesn't hang together. Puzo seems to throw a million different things together in total chaos. This book may be tolerable for lonely housewives, but for me, I'd only read it if I were really lacking amusement. I sincerely advise you not to purchase it. By the way, the TV series were even worse than the damn book."
1,"Don't bother, not even on a dare.","I had a number of problems with this book. First, the characters weren't believable. Each character was 'perfect' for their part (the brutally efficent hitman, the brilliant and wise don, the beautiful actress). No character inspired interest or empathy. It also seems that Puzo has had a very bad experience w/ Hollywood (specifically books being turned into movies). He uses a subplot to expound on the evil of Hollywood producers. It's interesting, but he should have made it a bit more subtle, rather than using 3 pages of mainly canned dialogue to get his point across. The plot in and of itself wasn't too hot either, and the subplots were only marginally related to the main plot. When the big secret is finally introduced, you can't help but think 'Oh. So what?' because the build-up was so poor. Finally, the ending of Cross' confict w/ Loddstone was too simple... too 'deus ex machina' for my tastes. Not worth your time at all."
4,Weakest story line of the series.,Simply does not compare to it's predecessors in clout or content. I could easily have edited 100 pages out of the first half of the book. Pure filler.Keep in mind - This is not a bad book -just not up to it's older siblings. MWY
4,THE MODERN GODFATHER ISN'T QUITE THE SAME,"Mario Puzo continues to write beautifully, but unfortunately by keeping up with the times it is not as entertaining. Although, I loved most of the characters and I think I know never to return to a casino ever again."
3,Don OK,"The plot was OK, and kept the interest of this reader, but the writing was very repetitive, and some of the individual sentences made me wince. For example ""You both look very much alike.""I did smile at the fact one character doesn't know about Romeo and Juliet: ""Who in Christ's name were those people. Certainly not Italians."""
5,Another mafia classic,Mario Puzo does it again. Takes his readers for a ride in the Mafia world where well written characters show and demand respect. Two thumbs up!
3,Not one of the better books of Mario Puzo,"The nicest thing I can say about this book is that if you have a long plane flight and nothing better to read, this is a page-turner that'll see you through. But THE GODFATHER it ain't, and that one was a better movie."
1,I should've borrowed and not buy the book!!,"Its so disappointing!!!! The characters are so comical (come one... what funny names), under-developed, plot (what plot?) unconvincing. This book does not even come half an inch near the greatness of The Godfather. I hope Mr Puzo didn't write The Last Don so that he can make it into a movie. I enjoyed The Godfather and The Sicilian, but this one, I'd just put it in a box and forget about it"
2,Boring,"I cant say i especially like any of the songs on this album. All of them are incredibly repetitive.If you like aphex's repetitive stuff, buy it, otherwise buy one of his better albums, like Richard D. James or Drukqs"
1,Bad techno that will make your friends puke on your carpet,"I love RDJ. I hate his analog music. It has no merits. It has no creativity. It doesn't touch the darker side of my mind. In fact it doesn't even touch me at all. Quite frankly, I have never enjoyed listening to this album, except for that song with the piano in it (track 5?) which isn't that good anyways, but I don't remember the name because I never listen to the album. If you want some good RDJ that you haven't heard yet, get SAW 2, SAW 1, The RDJ Album, I care because you do, or Come to Daddy. Don't deal with this album. The only time it could ever move you is if your mental defenses were already weakened by an ample supply of powerful hallucinogenic drugs."
3,"Good, but not amazing... 3 and a half stars really...","I was in a local record shop a few weeks ago, and one of the guys working there pointed this album out to me... they had just ordered it in, and it was hidden in the back... anyways, I just HAD to buy it, cause I'm a huge fan of Richard D. James' work... My collection is small so far, but it's growing slowely... anyways, I played it, and it's ok... I love track 1, 2, 4, and others, but overall it's too dancy for me... now mind you, it's better then most dance music you'll encounter, but compared to his other releases, this is a mediocre release... I do like every song, except for Quoth (too damn annoying), but most of the songs I just like, and not love... anyways, if you're a fan of RDJ, then definately check this out if you find it somewhere, otherwise I'd suggest I Care Because You Do, or Come to Daddy to start out..."
3,Agriculture,"This is unlike his later, more brutal work - it's closer in style to the first Orbital album, or some of the pieces on 'Selected Ambient Works Vol. 1'. It's smoother, more tuneful, more homogenous (it's very hard to think of a specific track after the album has finished), and less interesting than the proper 'Aphex Twin' material. It's a good place to start, though, as it has all the Aphex trademarks - sine-wave chimes, odd tunes, lots of reverb, and a fascinating balance between mechanistic coldness (his 'sound' makes no concessions to naturalness) and humanistic (the tunes are lovely) elements. It's a like an attractive sculture of a person, both beautiful and frigid at the same time."
4,Personable Music,"It seems a few others here have picked up on the cryptic cynycism of this album""If It Really Is Me"" is practically self-explanitory. It makes me think of a miserable woman clutching all-too-tightly onto her reality.And I also don't see listed here the untitled track #7 (not quixote) which gets top pick for the entire album. The echoing refrains, the lurid beats all conjuring dark and alien landscapes coming through on this track very brilliantly (and should not go missing on this album!)Quino - Phec is another EERIE track.A must buy for Aphex Twin fans and anyone who appreciates strange musical genius!"
3,Don't buy 'expanded'- 2 tracks shorter than non!-,"I guess this is what I get for not reading the tracklists) carefully enough. The so-called 'expanded' version of this cd is missing 'portreath harbor' + 'redruth school,' both of which are found under the ""normal"" release. The 'expanded' version is on WARP + TVT, and the (truly) expanded version is just on WARP. Don't I just feel like a schmuck? But seriously folks, don't make the same mistake.PS- the 3 stars is because of the -2 trax; I haven't honestly heard an ugly or beautiful second of this disc yet, so this isn't a 'true'review.I'm sure it's all in the category of ""Good, but Possibly Dated Early Works of a Genius""or something."
2,Maxam Stainless Steel,"I was a bit disappointed when I opened this box. It wasn't what I had expected. The picture on the website made it seem like the dish was deep enough for soup, but it was more flat than deep, not deep enough for a soup bowl. Maybe for a rice dish... I could have gotten a better one from Costco."
1,A disappointing tale.,"Don't let the star rating dissuade you, this is a great toy for a dog with a need to retrieve but who tends to lose tennis balls in the deep Maine snow. However, the tails supplied by KVpet had obviously been setting on a shelf for years as the ball part of the toy began breaking down within minutes. I chalk this up to inattention to stock rotation and to no fault in the toy design. Indeed, I am now playing with a tennis tail purchase several years ago in partnership with a hyperdog sling-shot as I write, a great combination in my wooded back yard. No my beef is with the supplier, not the tail."
1,Lady in the Lake,"This is a morbid account of the death of Mabel Smith Douglass, highly overpriced for a slim, poorly bound book. Little is said of her status; emphasis is on the details of the discovery of her body.Highly overpriced."
4,Get It for the Circus,"""He's Your Dog"" (1968) is considered the classic on this DVD, but in my opinion the bonus episode, ""Life Is a Circus"" (1980), steals the show. The animation is richer and drawn from a deeper palette than in most Peanuts TV specials (it even won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program), and the calliope-derived music, while not by Vince Guaraldi, really adds to the mood."
3,Okay but dissappointed,"Having grown up on CB and Snoopy, this video is half new cartoon and half cut and splicing in of other peanuts cartoons, which is probably why it isn't shown on tv since the visual and the story are not memorable. I watched it a couple of times with my kids (who love any peanuts cartoon) but was too disappointed to watch it anymore with them."
4,Good DVD - Horrible Shipping,"No complaints about the DVD - Our granddaughter loved it when we gave it to her 2 weeks after her birthday party. The problem was the shipping (3 plus weeks). Hopefully, Amazon will correct this problem with the supplier."
4,Good for the basics.,"I used the Chinese and Korean for a couple of recent business trips. I did not work at it enough to know everything the software was teaching, but what I did lean impressed my hosts. I think that was my goal. It shows an interest in another language that helps make a good impression in a foreign land.With a little modification to the config.txt file you can copy the disc to your hard drive and leave the CD at home."
4,instant immersion,"i really liked the idea of all of the asian languages in this packet. and the games are very fun and helpful, and you can hear how things are ""supposed"" to be pronounced as well. its a great way to learn i feel.the only negative thing i would have to say about this program, was that none of the ""talk now"" cds worked on my computer for some reason, all the others did though ((i have a windows vista)). and it shows how things would be ""written"" in that language, and in romanized form to help you to know how to pronounce it, which is really great, but i wish there was something to help you learn the alphabet/the pronunciations for one letter."
5,These are my favorite languages to learn!,"This software is so cool! I love learning these languages. Thai and Chinese are hard to learn, but I really love Korean and Japanese. This software is very good for people who are interesteed about the Asin languages, culture, or planning a trip to any of the countries in Asia."
4,Excellent collection of articles,"This is an excellent collection osf articles wich focuses on differents aspects of Stockhausen musical thinking. Make a good read of ""Ponts and groups"", ""Composing statistically"", ""Moment-forminng and MOMENTE"" and ""Microphonie"". It was specially fruitful for me, despite I have benn reading differents books about Stockhausen before. It is also strongly recommended for those who want to read about him for the first time. There are several of allusions to his bests works, specially the one he composed in the 60's, like Kontakte or Gruppen. It is not a strongly ""ego"" book like the interview of Mya Tannenbaum, so you may enjoy it, and, certainly learn a lot about him and about music too."
5,The taste of Childhood,"My grandma used to make Linguine and Clam Sauce for me all the time as a child. She was a fan of the white sauce only. I tried mixing this with a can of the white and PRESTO...it's good, trust me. Hit it with a little white wine and fresh herbs, finish it with a tab of butter and enjoy it with some toasted garlic bread. It just works. Oh, and you gotta add another can of clams, ya just gotta."
4,Jeff's Review Of Red Clam Sauce!,"I thought that this product had a savory taste with lots of flavor. I added about a 1/2 cup of red wine for each 10.5 ounce can. Excellent value for the price, without a lot of calories."
1,Won't Buy This Again,Very watery base to tasteless clam sauce. I complained to General Foods (Progresso) and received two coupons to use toward their products. I bought 12 cans of this stuff!!
5,The best CPR mask ever!,"I am an EMT and a CPR Instructor, and these are the BEST mask ever made. In the fire district I'm in, whenever we use a BVM and repalce it, we throw away the mask that comes with it and put in one of these. They are easier to seal (which is vital when ventillating) than any other mask I've ever used. I really have no idea why the old style masks are even still made. Buy lots of these and put them everywhere!"
2,Excellent,"The show may have lost some of it's greatness in this season, but it does not mean that it's not a bad season. In fact, it has some very memorable moments including the 200th episode which guests stars U2 and Steve Martin.With some DVDS, I neglect to buy them only because I can watch them on TV. But this is not the case with this DVD. Because they RARELY EVER AIR THEM. I've only seen Homer vs. NYC one time and that was about four years ago. The only episodes they do show of this season are ""Lost our Lisa"", ""Lisa the Simpson"", and "" The Two Mrs. Nahassapemmapettalonns"".If you really want to see these episode at all and uncut you'll have to buy this. And I'm sure you won't regret it.Written by a true Simpsons fan, for a true Simpsons fan."
1,"5 stars the the season, 0 stars for the DVD's",I have also gotten 2 sets of this season and both of them were badly scratched and completely unwatchable...WHAT'S THE FREAKIN' DEAL!!!
5,Almost Every One A Keeper,"It's funny; When I read some of the plotlines for some episodes, I'm not really sure I want to watch that one. Then I do, and remember all the little jokes I had long forgotten. The one w/Steve Martin and U2(Trash of the Titans)is my paticular favorite, but there are many standout episodes from Homer the football coach, with a nice appearence from Hank Hill and Family('We drove 3000 miles for this?'), to the true identity of Seymour Skinner. Apu's wedding was quite amusing, esp. w/Jan Hooks and Andrea Martin providing some support. The story of Lisa's sax has a great 'All in the Family' homage at the beginning, and Krusty's 'new comedy' has many classic moments. In short, Simpsons fans will not be disappointed. Plus it includes some nice 'postcards' inside the box that are kinda cool."
3,"The series is going downhill, but it is still The Simpsons","I must agree with others that the show really starts to slip in season Nine. The writing often gets very lazy and more formulaic, and the animation is now uninspired. When watching this season, at the time it was broadcast, I remember thinking that for the first time that some shows were actually kinda bad, which was sad... but still there are many fine moments. I found the episodes with Priniciple Skinner, Lisa's Sax, and Moe dating to be quite bad, and the Apu running lame storyline kinda stupid and kinda racist. The Burns Trillion dollar and the X-mas episode to be very inferior to previous similar episodes. Homer in the navy is such lazy writing, I guess trying to maintain the Conan legacy of absurdity.To keep buying these sets? Or not? Maybe you should stop at 8. Or not."
4,Some of the last great episodes packed into season 9.,"The density of great episodes per season already shows a slight decline in season 9, but it's still full of enough great ones to be well worth the time and money to own it on DVD. Many of these episodes are still extremely funny on repeated viewings. The parody of Lord of the Flies, titled ""Das Bus"" is worth it alone (""go banana!""). Some other particularly good episodes in this season are: Realty Bites, This Little Wiggy, Lisa's Sax, The Trouble with Trillions and The Cartridge Family. If you're a serious Simpsons fan, you're likely to really want this season 9 set even if some of the seasons that follow are not so much to your liking. Recommended."
4,You can finally see the cracks in the brilliance.,"Another great Simpsons dvd collection, however, not their best. I personally think after the first 5 minutes of the New York City episode that it is no longer funny. The singing clip show kinda is the suckiest suck that ever sucked. Some of the episodes are funny, but not real memorable. The potential buyer needs to know these things. However, a lot of it is first-rate, and well worth the money. Overall, go on and buy it....go on."
2,A precipitous dropoff,"This is where it ended. From seasons one through eight (especially four through eight), the Simpsons were a groundbreaking, occasionally sardonic, always witty satire of American life. But in season nine, something terrible happened and the show changed dramatically. It were as if there was a writers exodous and those brought in to fill the ranks couldn't conceive of anything other than bland, unintelligent humor. The dry wit, double entendres, and genius that had characterized the show suddenly vanished and we were left with this. It's not that season nine was terrible, it was just so average when compared to the stratospheric heights at which the bar was once held."
3,The End,I feel that Season 8 was incredible while Season 9 is far less entertaining. The dropoff is enormous. Stick to Seasons 1 through 8. Season 9 is the beginning of the end for this highly successful show.
4,"Hilarious, but kill the packaging","Another great season of the Simpsons. However, the packaging stinks as usual. Not the head package, which I really can't deal with, but the 'digipak'. These are crap packages compared to standard plastic cases. The packaging wears out, has a death grip on the disc. Paper is just a dumb idea for disc storage. Go back to regular plastic cases, please!"
4,"Hey, if it is the Simpsons, it has to be good!","What can I say, I have been a loyal fan since the Tracy Ulmann days. I would like to say because of this DVD set, I can truely say I have seen all the episodes. I am in the Navy and boot camp stopped my 8 season viewing streak. I can say I like them all; but I can mostly relate to the swashbukling adventure, Simpson Tide. One of my personal favorites. If you are a true fan, then purchase this. It, for right now is the crowning achievement in the Simpson's library. Of course, until season 10 hits the shelves."
5,Simpsons Season 9,"Good price, great shipping, great season. Must have have if you like the Simpsons."
5,One of the best seasons,"Season Nine of the Simpsons is possibly the best season after Season 4. The entire ""Cartridge Family"" episode is hilarious, and well worth the price of the entire set alone. (""Five day waiting period??! But I'm mad NOW!"")But nearly every episode on here is just as good, even though there are one or two that aren't up to the high standard of the rest of the season. While it's true that the show is no longer as funny as it used to be, the decline didn't start with Season 9. I'd describe this season as the time when the show peaked for the second time."
4,A haiku review (The Simpsons--The Complete Ninth Season (Collectible Lisa Head Pack)),Skinner is reallyArman Tanzarian?! Please.It's downhill from here.
4,Great dance cd,I love Boom! I got your boyfriend. I love that song. Its got awsome bass!~* I love this cd I could listen to it all day!~*$^ Beleive me...........you won't be wastin' your money on this cd!$
3,dvd's,Good sound and image qualiies but no options like subtitles and other languages which wa disappointing in this time in age.
2,Amusing Fiction,"She might be Cherokee, some of the words in the book are Cherokee, but Yahoo mainly spins fanciful yarns that have little or no connection to historical or mythological Cherokee teachings. Anyone can learn a little Cherokee and then use it to embellish New Age/quasi-Buddhist teachings, telling people what they would like to hear."
1,Speak for yourself...,"Siyo/Hello!All I have to say is that while Dhyani Ywahoo may be from one of the various Cherokee bands, she does not represent the Cherokee people in any shape or form. Sure, there are a few grains of traditional Cherokee teachings in her book, but it is not her right to show them off as ""traditional/kituwa"" teachings. This book is an expression of her own belief system and NOT THE CHEROKEE PEOPLE. There are already too many misconceptions floating around about ""authentic"" Cherokee culture/religion; this book just adds to the confusion. If you are interested in learning about Cherokee culture, frequent the pow wow's or stomp dances in your area. I hope this discourages anyone from making the same mistake I did.Wado/Thank you, and Happy New Year 2000!"
1,This book is very misleading.,"From the beginning, this book is misleading. Ms. Yahoo claims to represent something called the Etowah Band of Eastern Cherokees, which simply doesn't exist. Etowah is not even a Cherokee word. Etowah is a Muskogean place name. Her book is a mismash of New Age stuff, misunderstood Mayan cosmology, and even some Hinduism thrown in for good measure. The only authentic Cherokee lore in here is largely cribbed from Mooney's landmark ""Myths of the Cherokee"", because she follows Mooney's errors. Another poor example of cultural imperialism by a ""wannabe"" Indian."
4,Good History Lesson,I bought this book as a course requirement in Graphic Design at Academy of Art. I haven't finished reading the book but I have found it very useful. Give so good history about where everything comes from and how it is modernizing.
2,a reasonably harsh review,"if you enjoy reading, then re-reading paragraphs and then entire books, by all mean buy this. At times the author is quite insightful, though mostly seems to be voicing (in language no longer used) an external opinion on what the graphic design world is about. I wish I had done more research about this book and it's author before shelling out for it."
4,covers a lot of ground,"A timely update of Kotler's long running and successful book.There is a lengthy discussion, over many chapters, of putting together a marketing strategy. Given space constraints, the issues are well treated. The treatment of pricing strategies may not be as indepth as one in a text on finance or accounting. But there is enough detail here to be understandable and useful if your background is marketing.Unsurprisingly, he gives a good discussion of marketing on a global scale. Increasingly cheaper communications costs, especially of course email and browsers, makes a global campaign affordable, even for mid range companies.With the huge US corporate scandals of 2002 and ongoing (Adelphia, Enron, WorldCom...), Kotler provides topical advice on social responsibility of a corporation, and of the importance of marketing ethics."
2,Not really what i expected,"I purchased this tea/coffee maker to take with me to the office. The tea and coffee choices at the office are horrible and I thought this would be the perfect choice.The first couple of uses were fine, but as the plastic edges of the seal seemed to be used it got looser and pieces of loose tea would seep through.I would clean it right after my tea or coffee use but it still held on to the smells of whatever I made. I could never make tea after I made coffee after that or the tea tasted of stale coffee.In theory the cup is something that would be great to use, but it just felt cheap after a few uses."
5,really good little coffee maker,"I got this because my roommate for the summer didn't have a coffee maker. I didn't want to buy one, & thought this would be handy for making fresh refills at work or wherever. I was right. I used it all summer twice a day & no problem. It's best if you can coarse grind your coffee, but even the drip was not too bad if you pressed slowly & left room at the top. When I made a fresh one in the morning I poured half & half in the opening after I pressed. When I made the second cup at work, I put powdered creamer in with the coffee grounds. No problem either way. I didn't ever put a picture in. I think it's handy for it to be clear so I can see the grounds get pressed down & can go slow enough."
2,Great concept - Poor execution,"I've owned this mug for a couple of years and used it primarily for camping. Dan from Rochester got it right with his commentary, so I'll add just a few points.The concept is ideal for camping and reduces the effort to make really good coffee. However, the bad points regarding the plunger not going down far enough; leaking lid; etc. are all right on. Also, the cup is double-wall plastic for insulation. The inside sleeve on mine cracked when I poured boiling hot water in it!I would certainly purchase a similar item again, though not this one. Bodum just needs to increase the quality. I would pay twice the price for higher quality.Overall...not recommended."
2,"Grandma always said ""you get what you pay for""",Bought a bunch as gifts.. Many arrived broken and most friends said they lasted a month. Not a well made product.. Not great shipping either! No protective packing inside box at all!! Overall disappointed.
2,Great while it lasted...,"For 5 months I thoroughly enjoyed this mug, making 2-3 batches of coffee a day, and the occasional tea. But, the other day, the inner wall cracked (I assume accumulated stress of rapid expansion from pouring in boiling water.) Slowly warming the mug, say, in a hot water bath, may avoid this problem but seems to entirely counteract the point of having a convenient travel press...Also, it seems the plastic expands just enough to make it difficult for the threading on the lid to catch. I had a few mishaps spraying boiling water over myself when I forgot to double check the lid.I will next try a steel travel press."
2,Disappointing,"I love the concept & got it for my birthday. The press function works pretty well, but in the end I think it's better to make even a small amount of coffee in a bigger press. The bigger issue is that it leaks pretty badly. Don't know if it claims to be leakproof, but it's a farce if it does. Also, when mine arrived, it was partially broken. And though it claims to be dishwasher safe, condensation builds up inside of the insulation if you do go with the dishwasher. Overall, it's a product I can't recommend, as much as I wish I could."
5,Excellent product and really a great price,"I have been searching for this product all over the web and almost broke down to buy a pricey one from REI that cost 3 times as much as this one. The press really keeps grinds out really well and it is very easy to clean. This is a great time saver in the mornings. I just pour the hot water over my ground coffee beans and head out the door. Enviromentally friendly because there are no coffee filters, coffee pots, etc. to buy or clean. It truly makes mornings simple. I plan to buy more to give out as gifts."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought one of these at my local Starbucks (same brand, same mug). It is the biggest piece of garbage. I am a big tea drinker. Even the large leaf teas sneak through the sides of the plunger. The rubber ring around the plunger gives too easily. I thought what a great idea, I can brew right in my mug rather than through my tea filer and transfer it to a travel mug. No go. Not worth the aggravation.I couldn't imagine how many coarsely ground coffee grinds I would have in my mug when I have a ton of large tea leaves.I am surprised, since I have other Bodum products that are actually very good.Do yourself a favor, save your money."
3,Eh,"I got it for tea. And it doesn't keep the tea leaves down on the other hand, all the water trapped bellow the net doesn't spill.... so it's fine enough to keep water down, but still lets tea leaves through? I'd love a physics person to explain it to me.PROS: Super insulated nice spout, and can use without the cover feels like a glass."
1,Doesn't filter coffee grounds well at all,I bought this expecting it to work as well as other Bodum products and boy was I disappointed. It really doesn't filter the coffee grounds well at all and my coffee ended up with a ton of grounds in it. I am very very disappointed in this product.
2,Not good at all,"Given the reputation of the Bodum press, I am extremely dissapointed in this product. The press has a weak rubber gasket that does not seal well. You will definately get a big swig of grounds if you chug the last bit...quite unpleasant. I also have the Big Sky Bistro press (bought at REI for about $20). It is a FAR SUPERIOR product.Starbucks is currently carrying this model on the shelf for about $11."
1,"terrible french press, but hey, it's plastic","This is definitely the worst french press I've ever used. There are no handles, and the plastic gets too hot to hold, so you have to awkwardly pour by the top. The normal un-screwing of the top can also unscrew the bottom part of the plunger, which is then very hard to get out. For reasons I can't explain, the same coffee in the same sized press tastes significantly worse from this press when compared to my normal glass Bodum press. But the worst part is that plenty of grinds manage to squeeze around the edges of the plunger and end up in your coffee, no matter how careful you are.Basically the only good thing about this press is that it is made from plastic and is very durable. You can just toss it in your bag (or bring it camping) and not have to worry about it. Mine was a returned item, so I got it for $5, which is about how much this thing is worth. Every other press I've ever used works better, but at least this won't break."
4,Not a replacement for a french press,"Great for on the go use, but not a replacement for a french press. There are some pretty big grinds that end up in the coffee, and the rubber around the mesh seems to be deteriorating even though I do not use it that frequently.Pros:-Well insulated-Nice mouthpiece-Cover that snaps shut to keep it from spilling-Clear design is coolCons:-The rubber o-ring around the mesh filter is a bit low-quality-Doesn't always catch all of the grinds-Coffee is staining the cup a bit"
2,Bodem Travel Coffee Press,"I was a bit disappointed with the travel cup. I use a French coffee press at home and am used to strong, grain-free coffee. The travel cup does not provide that. Yes, it is convenient and I can easily take it with me; but the coffee contains grains regardless of how the press is positioned or the quantity of coffee grains placed in it."
2,french press to-go cup,"the cup was quite a bit scratched on the outside and i paid too much for it. You can buy the same thing at starbucks for $12.99!! so, bad buy here in amazon."
2,Double-wall is the only good point of this mug,"I got this mug at Target because I drink a lot of loose-leaf tea, I mostly was drawn to it for its double-walled construction.The seal for the 'plunger' strainer is not tight enough, and only the chunkiest/largest leaves will stay at the bottomThe plunger doesn't go all the way down.. so what am I supposed to do... put 2"" of tea leaves in there? Don't try green or white tea since they are so sensitive to heat and grow bitter the longer they steep.. you have no way to get them out once the steeping time has passed.The lid... oh yeah. The lid leaks, don't think about holding it upside down or even tilting it to the side with the cap closed.To sum it up: DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS. I'm really disappointed in Bodum, I have some of their mugs/tea pots.. but this is a sophomoric effort at best."
1,:(,"Pros:It holds liquid when sitting on tabletop.Cons:-The plunger does not work well to keep coffee grounds, or tea from floating up into your drink.-There is no seal or lock to keep the plunger fully depressed-- liquid might not leak from the drinking spout, but it will spill everywhere out of the plunger's hole.-Does not keep liquids hot very long.Don't waste money on this product."
4,Great coffee wherever you go!,"I bought this travel French press so I could stop buying bad coffee at work and instead make the delicious, bold coffee that I love. I grind the beans at home, put them in the bottom of the mug, and just add hot water at work. My coffee stays hot for a good long, while. The only problem is that the suction or the screen is not as good as in my glass French press. I do often end up with some grounds in my mouth. Overall, I am very pleased."
3,Ehhh...it's okay,"The biggest problem I have with this product is that the plunger doesn't fit snugly enough to the sides of the cup, which means there's a fair amount of coffee grounds still swirling around. However, the double-walled cup is awesome in keeping the drink hot for quite awhile."
3,Mediocre - lots of grounds in my coffee,"I found the Bodum 16-ounce coffee press to be tolerable, but not as good as other coffee presses. The flimsy plastic seal around the strainer often allows coffee grounds to get past. I tried various brewing techniques but I couldn't get consistently good results. I switched back to my glass-and-metal coffee press.I expected to get two mugs of coffee from the 16-ounce press, but I only got one and a half mugs, due to the ""dead space"" below the plunger. I was also irritated that they delivered a coffee press with the Bodum logo ""give up bad coffee for good"". I ordered a plain one because I don't like advertising!"
2,Ehhh (gallic shrug),"I am a long time cyclist, but there was really nothing of interest to me. I even read the book twice to see if I'd missed something. It didn't help. Oddly enough, I bought it because it was recommended by a friend. So, ehh."
4,Interesting and ahead of it's time,"I discovered this title in a public library back in 1995 and took it home, discovering what to me was a whole new musical experience. Whether played for background or foreground listening, Artificial Intelligence is both mentally stimulating and numbing at the same time, creating a quite unique musical atmosphere. Definitely recommended for first-time electronica listeners. Good title to get your toes wet before diving into other electronica."
2,Where's the beef?,"I wasn't very impressed with this book. There was lots of general common sense statements that don't need to be said. The author glosses over installing MySQL from source. The majority of the book deals with version 3.2. If you know nothing about databases and MySQL is your first, you might get a little out of this book. If you have some experience with databases, you will get little from this book. If you are a DBA you will get nothing from this book."
4,Kid loved it,"My 6 year old loves this toy. She made all 3 bears at one time. My husband helped her. They are well made and close up in the back with a zipper and special tool, so they do not come undone unless you want to open them and re-stuff them."
4,good toy for a little girl,"I believe Santa should bring one thing the child really really really wants no matter what the mother thinks of it. I read many bad reviews for this and was pleasantly surprised, although I didn't let my 6 year old daughter play with it until I could get to it. The zippers worked fine, the crank is still working, even though my 9yo son helped with the next two bears. I rate it fine for a plastic toy, and although there's not much educational value, I wasn't expecting it to have educational value! That's why Santa brings educational toys too!"
3,nothing exciting,This toy is o.k. My kids became bored after doing it a couple of times and now it sits.
2,zippers wouldnt open,she got it for xmas day very excited it looks very nice...3 bears included and I still cant get the zippers to open and have a very disapointed child
1,Cheap Plastic Junk,"Hmmm... What marketing genius came up with this one? Inferior, generic bears whose ""skins"" are filled via a ludicrously redundant Chinese-manufactured piece of plastic that might as well be placed directly in a landfill instead of bothering to put it in a box simply to skip the middle-man. It is the antithesis of an ""educational toy."""
2,Snoozeville,"You would think it would be tough to make anal sex boring. But this collection manages to pull it off. The stories are mostly sophomoric and the eroticism nowhere near as hot as it should be. Yeah, there's talk of rimming and such, but for the true fan of the derriere and all the excitement it holds, this book just doesn't do it justice."
2,Not at all like the old Horlicks,"I grew up in a city in Wisconsin where Horlicks had a facility. We could get Horlicks Malk powder in glass jars and it was WONDERFUL! Pure malt flavor you could put in milk, or add to just about anything! Horlicks sprinkled on chocolate ice cream was a real treat. This tastes nothing like that. I don't even know how to describe the taste - but malt would not be one of the words I would use!"
5,Pleasently Surprised,"Horlicks Original Malt Beverage Mix England, 800-Gram Packages (Pack of 2)The delivery was much, much quicker than I thought arriving possibley Febuary 15th so wonderful because onlyhad one spoonful left in my old one. This time I went bigger and better getting the 800 gram x 2 wonderful nightime drinkbefore bed or any other time actually calming, soothing, just perfect. Being from England this is thedrink I grew up with but only in recent years here in USA has it been easier to get .THANKS AMAZON"
2,interesting,it was not as strong for baking as the product from other companies. I was disappointed having read of its historically traditional origins.Everyone's expectations in flavor varies widely.
5,High Energy Techno at it's best!,"Psykosonik's brand of high-speed, high-energy techno is a force to be reckoned with. Songs like ""Acid Hammer,"" ""Welcome to my Mind,"" and ""Teknojihad"" are examples of what all techno bands should aspire to be. Like their music, their lyrics also hold a certain mesmerizing power."
5,Ahead of its time,"Psykosonik was, and is, definately ahead of their time. Every time I play this album, it always generates comments which draw comparisons to recently published ""electronica."" Very intelligent, danceable beats. Great lyrics with plenty of Cyberculture references. Best of all, they are from Minneapolis."
4,ONE OF THE BETTER DANCE CDS,"Psykosonik is an intersting combination of 2 unlimited, Republica, and a bit of Depeche Mode (just a little bit). It is good dance music but it is not particularly memorable. For great techno, get Jouney to the Infinite by Juno Reactor."
2,Ho-hum . .,"I bought this after hearing a dandy remixed version of ""Silicon Jesus"" on Wax Trax' ""Black Box"" compilation. I have to say, they did take the best track for the compilation, and there isn't very much else noteworthy to choose from.""Welcome to My Mind,"" ""Silicon Jesus,"" ""I Am God,"" and ""Shock On The Wire"" are the only tracks resembling actual songs here, and even those tend to blend together. It's energetic enough, does have a bit of an edge and wouldn't be bad to dance to, but as listening music it needs an infusion of ideas.If you prefer your techno to at be at least a little experimental, cast your gaze elsewhere."
1,Well its not to good.,I bought the game by activision called x-kaliber 2097 wich had the soundtrack made by psykosonik and i thought it rocked but after seeing some of the names of these songs my attitude has severly changed.
3,RW suede bomber jacket,"i liked the jacket but the color is not as rich as it looked online, but it does fit really nice and i get a lot of compliments on it"
2,stay away of this one.,"I love Intel motherboards, but this form factor is an entire problem. Read carefuly the word ""for BTX"" I found this motherboard and I thought I was going to build an inexpensive computer. Terribly wrong. First BTX cases are expensive (if you find one). Second, the processor and fan needs to be compatible and this is difficult considering how old it is. Third DDR400 memory is practically obsolete, you can find it, but it is more difficult today (2008) than two or three years ago when this motherboard was designed. Read before clicking or you will buy an absolutely useless piece of equipment. You better go for an ATX motherboard capable of DDR2 and Dual Core. Believe me , you are not going to save money with these old motherboards."
1,lousy,I liked the albums 'Tiger of the Raj' and 'Feet in the Soil' and had hopes. But it's uninspired and boring. How did it get all these stars?
3,"WELL CRAFTED, BUT UNEXCITING","The brief description on Amazon initially likened Titan Force to Jag Panzer. That may be because it's the same vocalist, Harry Conklin, in both bands. Harry left Jag Panzer for a while to form Titan Force before rejoining his original band, and recorded two Titan Force albums, of which ""Winner/Loser"" is the second. Although the songcraft, musicianship and production are all of high quality, the material seems uninspired and seems to lack the spark of energy that all rock music needs. I had the opportunity to see him perform this material live at Union Station in Colorado Springs a couple of months ago (his hometown), before going over to perfom in Germany. Live, this music is better than the recording, but unfortunately, Titan Force never gave me the adrenaline rush and chills that good heavy metal is supposed to provide to its listeners."
3,ITS OK,"I only got this Movie because bizz bone is in it, and it was the stupids movie i have ever seen in my life, Bizzy bone is the only good actor in it..DONT GET THIS DVD."
5,Reformed,I thought the movie was good. It gave me a great pleasure to see a young man that was caught up in a bad situation because of bad choices turn himself around and do something good for the family of a man he accidently murdered. Dre became redeemed and turned himself in to the law to confess his wrong. I think that the movie gives an excellent insight on what could happen if one confesses to what was done wrong and changes it to do what is right.
5,A quality film in every way,"When I first rented Jacked Up, I thought it would be the stereotypical hood movie. I was wrong. The acting by all of the cast is superb, the plot twists are VERY unusual and make this movie like no other you have seen. It's surreal. You never know where this movie is going untill the end. It is one of the most amazing movies ever made. Ronreaco Lee and Bizzy are perfect adversaries. The moral lessons in this movie were right on target for today's society. This is easily one of the best movies ever made."
5,great product and service,The music is beautiful. Very calming and exciting. This music captures Ireland and the celtic mystery. Perfect service!! very happy!!
5,Great coffee at a great price,"I've just received my 150 ESE Pods and I couldn't be happier. They produce great espresso with my Francis Francis! I still like to drink Illy once in while, I believe it produces a slightly better espresso, but it is almost three times the price of these pods. I'd recommend to buy these for your daily coffee and to buy the Illy and other finer brands for the weekends!"
2,Loosely packed ese pod produces inconsistent results,I own an Illy x6 and it came with a sampler of illy ese pods. When those ran out I researched online and ordered these pods. First of all the pod is not tightly packed and has a looseness which makes the fit in the holder improper. As a result sometimes the illy machine keeps on going and overflows the normal quantity which an espresso cup would hold.Secondly the flavor body and aroma are diffuse and not good for espresso. If you are making a cappuccino you will likely not taste much difference. I do not recommend Lavazza for espresso on an illy machine.
4,Good little pods!,"ESE pods make great espresso in our Krups pump espresso maker. Smoother, more flavorful espresso than the Espressione Classic Espresso Coffee Pods. The Lavazza Gran Crema Pods seem a little smaller than others, so we use the smallest filter holder. Also recommended: PodMerchant Espresso Pod Super Sampler."
5,Great Value!,"I used to buy pods from another vendor but they have since gone out of business. I bought these and they are very good. Good creme, great taste and come in a large box.I will be buying these again as it appears to be the best value and flavor around."
5,really good price and really good coffee.,"I purchased 150 pods for approximately $52 which is a really fair price. I will order again for sure. The coffee is rich and makes a good crema. I had only seen Lavazza but hadn't, to my knowledge, had it. I was not disappointed. If you're looking to try a new pods without making a huge investment, try these."
2,Too weak!,"This ""Espresso"" coffee is too weak. Tastes like regular American coffee. This is not the taste you are looking for when you buy espresso. I use it with my Delonghi espresso machine, foam is good but taste is bad.I will try another brand in the future."
3,Lavazza Espresso Pods,"The quality is excellent. It worked well in my machine. My problem is with the taste. It is very light and sweet. My lattes tasted like sweetened milk. If you don't like much coffee taste, these are the way to go. I returned mine."
2,Not fresh tasting. Bitter.,"I expected better from Lavazza having been introduced to it in Rome last year. In perspective, I usually grind my espresso beans (Brazil Sweet Blue is my favorite) immediately before brewing and I always buy beans that have been roasted no more than 1 week ago. This obviously skew my taste toward fresh product and these pods are definitely not that. Convenient, though."
2,Loosey goosey.,"Easy serve espresso pods, or ESE pods are supposed to be a consistent size, weight and tamp. But as a machine manufacturer I can tell you first hand that the coffee brewers intentionally modify the ESE spec to make their pods more likely to work well in their machine. ( and not so well in a competitor's) You see, in Italy, the coffee biz is like the cell biz here. Buy a contract for two years of monthly pods and we will throw a machine in for free. They don't want you using that machine with OPP (other people's pods). So they take a perfectly good standard and tweak it so it is no longer a standard. In the case of these pods, they are way too loosely packed to work in any of my pod only machines. Water flows so fast it barely changes colors. Oh well, I've only got 149 left. Ughhh."
1,No value,"Lavazza coffee is great - no problem with that, but these pods are an absolute waste of $. I thought the pods would offer some convenience when in a rush to make espresso in the morning when heading out to work. Wrong move. They work poorly - I tried them in three different high quality machines, all with the same results. Poor, uneven flow with not enough substance to give a smooth shot with good creme. Frustrated, I decided to just open up the pods and put the good stuff in a can for proper use... that's when I discovered just how big a rip-off these are. Buying Lavazza in the can is about $7.00 for an 8.8 oz. can on average - I bought 150 pods for about $55 and when I emptied out about half of these into a can I got just that - 1 can. $27.50 per can. Hmmm... that means I just paid $20+ for their packaging. Stupid me. Convenience be damned, I'll just buy canned coffee and work for my cup in the morning."
1,Poorly Made,"The story line was great, I never heard of the the Black Sailors of the USS Mason. Wonderful piece of history. But, the movie was poorly made, the screenwriting lacked realness, although Ossie gave a stellar performance, the movie didn't get to the soul of these sailors. Everything looked faked, a little CGI would have spruced it up a bit."
3,Proud,"Thought the movie was just a ittle bit low key. My brother served on the USS Mason, and his experiences were more electrifying than the movie."
1,SLOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This had to be the MOST boring, slow, movie I have ever watched! Would have rather watched ..paint dry!!!!!!! Actually went to sleep during the first 30 min.! Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Keep in mind...,"... that this was their first CD, which was put out on an independant on a $600 budget. OK? Sure it's not the same as TTSR! (not even the same genre) but it's still interesting to take a look back on the early days of pm5k. I also like the bass groove it has to it... not what I usually listen to but I really like playing bass so it is fun to learn some new genres. Keep an open mind!"
2,I'll cut them some slack,"Theres 1 reason I bought this CD, to own every Powerman 5000 CD. I'll cut right to the chase, this CD isint good. I like one song, the first one. I'll cut them some slack though, it was there first album. Dont get me wrong, I love powerman 5000, im just not a fan of this CD."
1,(insert title here),"this cd was not what i expected. i didnt know when i got this a few years ago that PM5K was a crappy rap-core band when they got started. gave it a shot, still think it sucks. i treid to sell it but no place would buy it, thats how bad it is. i was not dissappointed when my dog pissed on it."
1,CAUTION,"If you order this corbel, what you get will be a smaller, cheaper version and will not have routered edges."
2,Stripped Adjustment,"You can't beat the low cost of this headlight assy, which even includes the bulb. Unfortunately mine failed to adjust left to right due to a stripped gearbox. What really bugged me is that there is no information from the manufacturer so you can't call anyone for potential repair or replacement info. Amazon does provide a return option."
5,Installing was a piece of cake,Followed the advice of other reviewers and made sure that we saved all of the bolts/screws from the old assembly (should be a Golden Rule and always done automatically!) So nice to be able to see again:) Went through all of the rains of Hurricane Sandy and no leakage - so far - so good!
2,be careful,I had to return the item because in less than a month the inside reflector was coming off and it had water inside the light assembly.
4,Looks Great!,Had no problems getting this to mount right in place. My only problem is the other side is faded since this one looks great. For the price I may go ahead and get the other side so they match.
4,buy these,"great replacement lights, i shopped around, great buy for the price, came with new bulbs as well. from a mechanic point of view good deal"
2,Disposible!!!!,"Yes, the 1st time I put this insert in I was amazed.....too bad the 2nd time I tried to wear it I got 1/2 way through dinner and ""pop!"" the fastner, which is not shown that holds the 2 sides together for enhanced clevage pulled apart.My breasts looked deformed!My husband had to whisper for me to go to the bathroom and correct myself!!!!I tried to replace it and purchased another one--same thing--2nd use and it popped!Would not recommend but for 1 use! If you are looking for regular wear BEWARE!!"
1,Not Happy,They were not what I excepted at all. I was not pleased with these purchase. They didnt add any size or enhancement. I wont suggest these to anyone.
3,No support- very thin- great for nipple coverage,"I was going to return them but to tell the truth I never end up returning half the things I should. I decided I would use these instead of nipple sheilds. But I bought them to use under my strappless dress at a wedding but they kept showing because they are kinda tall (covers alot of the breast) If I was to ever get these from the store and got to see them first, I wouldnt of got them. If I wanted them to be used as a nipple sheild I woulda gotten a size smaller then I am."
4,Quick fix!,These inserts do the job when you want to wear a nice strapless dress and you're looking for that extra lift and cleavage.
4,Good product,"The sticky backing actually sticks! I have used these a multitude of times now, and still do not have to worry about them sliding around or falling away."
4,been great help,I am using them while I await breast augmentation surgety and they have been great. I look fuller so that after the procedure it won't be so obviously since Im doing a conservative increase. The only con is that they have an adhesive that is sticky and causes breast area to have slight odor once removed.
4,Vintage Clapton Vinyl,"I did not know this even existed when we found a tattered, scratched copy in a friends collection. So I went hunting for another and there are not a lot of them around. Pretty rare. Hey, it's vinyl so either you remember why we heralded the coming digital age, are nostalgic for the old days or are so young you can't remember the difference. Quality of sound is in the ears of the listener. This collection includes just about everything from the Derek and the Dominoes days which included Duane Allman and a sampling of other stuff including Delaney and Bonnie et al. If you're collecting old vinyl then this is a good bet. Be careful, however, because one seller's idea of ""collectible"" or ""very good"" may not be the same as yours."
2,eltron rotary shaver,"convenient size and design but essentially a cheap knockoff of a great Norelco travel shaver, no longer made. I have purchased two of these shavers, both worked great for about 6 months but the switch on both broke making the unit inoperable. If you are looking for reasonable good quality, this is not the item to buy."
4,"VERY helpful book and easy to read! However,","it is very rudimentary. I would like more emphasis on what's needed beyond insisting on respect. If the parents don't model respect for others and themselves, the child won't have any idea what it looks like.I have used the methods in this book successfully, but slightly modified for my 5 year old daughter so that she won't feel broadsided by consequences before she knows what's expected of her. I tell her first when she's nearing a boundary, and she's eager to learn the rules.This book DOES give concrete advice about what to do when it feels as if there's nothing you can do. I recommended it to any thoughtful parent who feels guilty about having to set limits."
5,"Short, simple, specific and easy-to-read.",Practical ideas for solving a common problem. Works especially well with pre-teens. Worth a read. I'd also recommend: Kid Cooperation (How to Stop Yelling Nagging and Pleading) by Elizabeth Pantley
4,Very Helpful,"This book has been very helpful to me both with my children at home and with my students in the classroom. It has an excellent section on the effects of the media on behaviors of children. One thing that it did not emphasize enough, though, is that parents and teachers must earn respect from children--they are not automatically entitled to respect simply by being in a teaching position or by giving birth to a child. This program will not work for any teacher or parent who is rude, critical, sarcastic, hostile and/or disrespectful to children."
1,not for me,"I didn't like this book. It's about giving zero tolerance to children's rudeness. The authors are convinced that there way is right. It is authoritarian style parenting. It's supposed to be about logical consequences but the consequences are not logical just punishing. They don't recommend, they tell you what you must do. They say that not taking your child to a concert where people are relying on him to perform is how to deal with rudeness and teach him/her how to be respectful of other people!!! Parent's need to see the bigger picture and deal with the situation which includes the child's rudeness and not focus solely on that."
4,How Much Guilt is Needed to Destroy a Good Marriage?,This is a tragic novel dealing with the aftermath of an accident that leaves a womanparalyzed. How much does it take to destroy a good marriage?The husband inadvertently turns his wife into a quadraplegic by making messingaround with a boat that he really can't operate. His guilt and her bitterness are thebaggage that is ever present in their marriage.This book is depressing and tragic but very well-written.
2,Dissapointing indeed,"I mistakenly purchased this book at a friend's recommendation. However, I only LATER found out I had gotten the TITLE wrong!But having bought the book, I proceeded to read it. Talk about a dissapointment! There is enough guilt and depression in life without another story that offers no ""hope"" or reconcilliation in broken relationships. You can watch soap operas and get the same result! If you want a challenging and uplifting book, try the one that I was originally SUPPOSE to read! ""A Severe Mercy"" by Sheldon Vanauken. Now THAT book makes you think about what is TRULY important in life! I won't be the same person after reading it!"
3,Not Comprehensive Enough,"This book was OK, but it was pretty basic. More information was definately needed-especially to spice up parts on the company financial section. Overall, it offers a pretty simple read, with some ""lingo"" being explained. This is a great book though for people just getting into small cap investing."
3,The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes,"This book, though dated, contains a lot of good information on the movement of sand. This provides a good beginning for someone interested in this subject. there is a newer book on the same subject that provides the results of more recent experiments and analyses of sand movement."
4,It's a Really Interesting Book!,It's sort of like a mystery. It's four kids who go to camp and their camp director has a lot of hair so they are going to figure out if he is a werewolf or not! It's a really good book.
1,encourages weight-based discrimination,"I bought six books from this series and noticed that they may encourage discrimination, or bullying, of overweight children.From Werewolves Don't Go to Summer Camp""Mr Jenkins reached out and pinched Liza's plump arm. 'And it looks like you need some exercise' he added.""From Leprechauns Don't Play Basketball""As soon as his teacher turned away he pinched Liza's chubby arm.""In the other 4 titles, the authors leave Liza alone and instead call other children fat throughout the books. There is at least one mention of a child being fat in every one of the six I purchased."
4,Werewolves dont go to summer camp,"This book is so exciting you will laugh through the whole book. It is about this man who is a camp director, but the kids think he is a werewolf because he is so hairy. One day night the camp director was grilling hamburgers and the kids ate one. As soon as the kid bit in, red blood started coming out. So they went to go tell the camp director. He said ""What is wrong with, it's good.""This book was telling me that what you think is not always right. Just because a person looks like that you always have to know the inside of them. Everybody should read this book it is teaching a lesson. So that is what I think about this book. READ IT!!!"
1,What A Boring Book,"The book I read is called Were Wolves Don't Go To Summer Camp by Debbie Dadley and Marcia Thorton Jones. Were wolves don't go to summer camp is the worst book I have ever read in my life. It is so boring. All the book really says is -there is Mr.Jenkins wearing his same lone wolf T-shirt, his same ripped up pants, and his two medal dog tags. It just keeps repeating that over and over. It probably says it at least 25 times. If you pick up this book you are making a huge mistake. All this book does is waist your time and bore you. As a matter of fact I couldn't think of a worse book than this. On a rating from 1-10 I would give this book a 0, and I highly recommend that you choose a different book than this one."
4,Great CD,A great CD to put on and let your mind wander. The musicians a very talented. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good music.
3,Fun but leaves you wanting more,"A fun introduction to numbers and their myriad uses. It is really just an overview of concepts, applications and puzzles concerning numbers. It left me wanting much more but not knowing where to go. Still it was a fun read."
5,A former customer of Jeff Bale...,"If Jeff Bale is featured in this book, I applaud the author for highlighting Mr. Bale's work.We hired Jeff to create a backyard experience featuring a stone firepit which is fabulous.He also crafted a beautiful pergola to showcase a large whisteria plantthat had grown into a heaping mound. The pillars were set in wood and nicely designed.The base is lined with a narrow stone path on the ground intorducing the arbor.This stone outline that travels the width of the entire framed arbor.It was also designed with one step lifting on to a flat bed gardenand highlights two sections of white impatiens to showcase our pool.A couple of years after Jeff architected our new landscape design,we had a scout from Better Homes and Garden ask if theycould feature our yard in their magazine.Jeff's work is timeless and incredibly creative!"
5,Daring to Engage,"The breadth of Barbara Kingsolver's work continues to amaze me. Some of the stories in this book were just ok, but many of them blew me away with how powerful they were. This book is about relationships and the struggle to overcome the ongoing dialogue going on in our head and daring to reach out and risk everything and authentically engage."
2,A bit boring,"I finished this book because I started it. It as one started to get interested in a heater, the story ende. Not enough plt either. Was happy when I finished o I coud read one thing better (and usually I live Kingsolver!)."
3,Stories of Families'struggles,"This book has many stories involving everyday people with everyday problems. Many people in those stories either have love for nature,or have a difficult time with their families. I liked it to a certain point because it seemed like the stories were all the same and had all the same point."
5,Each story says something worth remembering,"Lovers whose relationship nearly founders when a new environment changes both partners in ways neither expects. A woman working in a ""man's job"" (mining) who suffers the consequences of a strike in ways no man possibly could. A seemingly pleasant neighbor who abuses an elderly lady's trust, but doesn't see his own actions in that light. In each of these 12 short stories, Barbara Kingsolver draws her characters clearly and says something worth remembering about life, love, and human nature. Not every writer can handle this format and the novel equally well, but Kingsolver's touch is as deft here as in her much longer works. Especially good reading for those nights when you don't want (or can't afford) to be kept up by a book you can't put down!"
1,Don't buy these!,"Quality very poor, no better than drugstore brands. Made in China.The enamels fell off everywhere already when I opened the box! Tried to band to an ~45 degree angle the pin lose it's elasticity and became useless. The tips are not well enameled, it hurts to touch the scalp!!!Shipped very very slow, and the seller ignores customers' emails forever!!!Don't buy these!!!"
1,Do NOT buy this game,"Worst video game purchase I've made in five years. Endless cut scenes, repetitive and unsatisfying gameplay, pointless ""special abilities"" and other useless crap, jerky graphics, stupidly complex controls and a completely non-functioning pov camera angle. The Wachowski Bros worked on this? Bullsnot. They loaned their name and cashed a check. Avoid this ripoff like the plague unless you are a twelve year old fanboy with no life."
1,Did not work,I ordered this game for my son. When we received the game it was not working. We tried it in a couple of Playstaion 2 systems and it was still no good. I need to return this game.
3,Balanced Both Ways,"I first played this game as a kid. I still have fond memories of the game. However, the games graphics are nothing impressive. The Wachowski brothers (who personally worked on this game) focused on gameplay and how you could feel like you were right there in the matrix. They did an amazing job at this, but they must have put graphics as an extremely low priority as they didn't make any good impact on the game, or the review.Also, the game has extra segments that weren't included in the movie. I loved these. Its great how they tried to add to the movies. However gameplay got repetitive after a while.To sum it up, if you don't mind bad to average graphics then you'll love this game as the gameplay dilemma can easily be overcome."
1,very shocking,"it was really nice at first but if ur an ameture skater, then dont even bother buying this board. I snaped both of my decks within 2 weeks. the first deck i did a nose slide at a skatepark, and it snapped. the second board i snapped today doing a regular kickflip. Although it is good for beginning skateboarders, i was really shocked in the poor quality mongoose put in its skateboards if i could rate any lower, it would be in the negative stars."
2,"Great for beginners, Not so great for amateurs","This is a really good beginners skateboard! I learned how to ollie on it and i also learned a kickflip on this board. But after a while i realized that the board wears down quickly, especialy the bushings. the deck snaps when you try more advanced tricks and i suggest getting nicer bearings if you plan to keep this board for a whilePros: Good trucks, wheels, great for starting outcons:bad deck quality, bearings, spacers, trucks are a lot narrower than board"
1,Both decks badly warped!!,Wheels don't lie flush with the ground due to warp. bearings popped their protective shield within an hour. Looked like it had been returned once as well.STAY AWAY!!
2,Not good for small frame/large cup size combo,"I have a very small frame and wear a 32D. I have a number of underwire Wacoal bras with foam cups that work very well for my size, but this bra is painful to wear. When I first tried it on, I thought I would like it. By the end of the day, I was regretting the purchase. The wires are sized for a much larger framed person than would be able to wear a 32, so the wires dig up into the flesh under my armpits. The bra is very pretty and the band size is consistent with my other Wacoal 32D bras. The disproportionate length of the wires makes the bra too uncomfortable to wear. I may try to return it, but I don't think I will be able to now that I have worn it."
5,My favorite Bras!,"Love, Love, Love this bra. I was first introduced to Wacoal bras at a high-end department store but could only afford to buy one. I loved the fit and quality so much, I had to purchase more. This bra fits perfectly, is practical and comfortable while still looking pretty with the lace and the price is unbeatable! highly recommend this bra and especially Wacoal in general."
5,Wonderful book,"Shades of Memnon is a spellbinding, exciting, intriguing,mesmerising first book in a tale of epic proportions. It has all of the elements peculiar to the sword and sorcery genre: a gallant hero, nubile beauties, an evil wizard and benevolent fairies. The author, however, maximizes these elements through superlative storytelling that submerges the reader in a world he captures in stunning detail. The hero is no cardboard cutout with stock muscles and a sword, but a figure whose full humanity is conveyed even as he undergoes a transition from an ordinary youth to a warrior of superhuman strength and endurance. This book is a thrill ride of an adventure from beginning to end."
5,Shades of Memnon,"This is an excellent book/series. I could not put this book down. It is 'action packed',from a spiritual and physical perspective. (A large percent of this book seems to be fact rather than fiction)."
5,progresso white clam sauce,"This product is excellent. Just boil some spagetti and microwave the clam sauce in a glass covered container and you have dinner in 15 minutesBe sure to cover the clam sauce in the microwave, or it explodes on you and makes a mess.Love the product"
3,Good product Small can.,"Wal-mart in my area stopped selling this product, when I found it on the net I stocked up but the can is much smaller than what I was used to. As a result the price was much higher than what I expected. I use it with shelled raw shrimp, extra garlic, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese and a bit of fresh Basil from the garden. Served over thin linguine and garnished with lemon and lime slices. Variations include white wine, lemon and lime juice and sour cream added,also angle hair pasta or thin spegetti works well. This makes a very quick elegant meal in just a few minutes. The sauce can be made before the pasta cooks. Be creative, Progresso's White Clam Sauce is a good base for many dishes. Shrimp and clams is an unusual combination but very good if you like both."
5,a great little book on the subject,"Many people know about the rock tombs of the Valley of the Kings, yet little know that these tombs were the end product of a development which had been ongoing since at least the Old Kingdom. There are tombs where the dead were buried and tomb-chapels, sometimes placed far apart. This book particularly describes the relationship between Deir el-Medina (the workmen's village) and the New Kingdom rock tombs. It is a refreshing book, recommended for all interested scholars."
3,It's Pretty Much Off Tha Hook,"Some of the songs are kicking it, Like I got a man by positive k! Keep on playn that song!"
3,Well Made,"Being plus-sized and pregnant, I thought that this babydoll style would work well for me. I purchased it as a special something to put in my husbands stocking this Christmas. I don't like to wear it for two reasons.The First being that I don't FEEL sexy in this. The point of lingerie is to feel sexy and have a sexy attitude. The panties were cut quite small, so as that I can't even see them under my belly without use of a mirror.My second reason is that the lace is very itchy. It does seem to be fairly well made, however. Great for its price.I gave this item 3 stars because my husband does like it. It is well made, and the service and shipping were good. However, it makes me feel like a whale wearing lace."
2,Low quality,I should have listened to the other reviews but I didn't low quality should be 99 cents. Not happy with the BabyDoll I am a size 11-13 and a 38D top was too tiny and panties were as well def not plus sized I was worried it would be too big I was wrong!!!
3,book review,I was hoping to find out about growing cynthiana grapes-this was not the book. This is an interesting book of one man's experience with wine in general and his unending awe of the cynthiana grape.
4,Always get compliments...Great looking Birk...,Wore them all summer and good reminder to get pedicure on time. Wear them around the house now (Dec). They attract many compliments. Good shipping and packaging.
4,Birkinstock sandal,"Great bargain! Bought in bargain department. although a soft bed would have been "" broken in"" sooner, I am happy with the choice."
4,Nothing like good TEAMWORK,"I have to say, I didn't know what to expect when I bought this album, but his collaborators listed by the track names on the back of the CD were very recognizable names, so I bought it...THANK GOD I DIDI found out recently that Mijk Van Dijk is one of Germany's premiere DJ's and musical artists, and among his many accomplishments, he has played and is playing this year (2000) at Berlin's world famous Love Parade in July. His album of self-created tracks (this is not a mix album, but rather his own tracks one at a time) is a blend of funky techno-house tracks that are at all times good groovy electronica. Highly recommended for techno fans that like thicker, non-minimalist sounds and/or house fans that like techno-inspired house music."
5,Covers scientific side effects from early to modern times,"Science has always had its dark side, always having a cost to the development of life-saving technologies and solutions to human problems. In The Name Of Science covers scientific side effects from early to modern times, covering everything from Medieval disease treatment to modern gene therapy. Ethics and social issues are considered in light of these revelations about discovery, experimentation, and science's side effects."
4,Crumb!,"I think it is useful to have seen the documentary ""Crumb"", to enjoy his work. He is an amazingly confessional artist who has turned his own obsessions and fantasies into a an amazing career. It doesn't get any better than that."
3,Crumb is fun and sick,"Crumb, as I got to know through the fantastic documentary of his life, is one messed up dude. His book, a collection of his relationship cartoons, is often quite funny and a little sick. It was a bit much to read in one sitting, but his strongest critic is himself and he does have some good insights into human nature. He is an odd dude, but it was worth a read."
1,Cracked during sintall,I didn't expect this to be of super quality but the cheap plastic cracked while I was screwing it in.
2,Too Much Spoken Word,This CD does not have very much music on it. There's a lot of American Indian spoken word. Not good for meditating at all.
3,Good product w/ its faults,"This product works extremely well; if it is working that is. There are no problems with the earbud part, but as most reviewers have said before me, the microphone is what causes most problems. Earhugger claims that the headset works with most soundblaster compatible sound cards, but they fail to mention that the microphone only works in Mono mode which means that most new sound cards won't be able to use it since they work in Stereo mode. The remedy is to simply buy an adapter that converts the plug from mono to stereo, and everything will work fine. I bought my adapter at Radio Shack for $, and it was pretty easy to find. Overall, a good product, but poor support."
2,Not that good...,"You may see a lot of people saying this headset is comfortable, and true enough, it is. It's the mic that has its troubles. Very weak signal, it barely picks up your voice. The earbuds are good, and I would rather take off the mic, and use it as earphones, than scream just so it would pick up my voice."
4,Great product!,"This is the most comfortable headset I have used. Some other headsets are very irritating after wearing for an extended time, not with this headset. Good sound quality as well for a little earbud."
1,Wishing I had stayed loyal to Koss...,"I purchased the EarHugger Com7000 which is supposed to be a combined headset with boom microphone. Either the microphone arrived broken or it generates a signal that is so weak that it won't register on my computer. In any case, it has proven to be a complete waste of money. I am using it with a Sound Blaster Live! card (pretty standard) on a microphone jack that works fine with an inexpensive Radio Shack microphone."
5,"Even as Lymond becomes more difficult, he is fascinating...","I am a big fan of the Lymond series by Dorothy Dunnett, though following her character Francis Crawford of Lymond through his many complex journeys is anything but predictable. Lymond's character becomes almost difficult to enjoy at times, but ever more fascinating as the reader watches Lymond make his life choices and then reap the consequences; some of them quite terrible. In this installment, his allegiance to Ivan of Russia gives Crawford extraordinary power and leadership, but makes him a hard man, even harder than he has been in previous books."
2,"Great idea, but very sloppy","I bought this when I was first learning about the fiancee visa process, but have been disappointed by it since then. It is a comprehensive guide to a complicated process, but it is not as well-organized as it should be. Also, some of the information is flat-out incorrect. For the price, the AIN Inc. staff really needs to do more checking and updating. However, for those who are not newsgroup and on-line form inclined, it is probably better than trying to learn about the K-1 over the phone or at the library."
3,What happens next...,"It's a coming out book. Thats just it, a coming out book. I thought there was more but it kept me hanging... ""So what happens next!"" The build up of the story was great giving all sides of the main character and the other people influencing, but at times it becomes repetitive and it became anti climactic in the end. Good thing there is the sequel, I just hope it doesnt finishes on the same note as this one."
2,"Topo maps yes, but hard to use and outdated.","This is a useful volume for back roads and trails, but I was very disapointed with the ""topo maps for the entire state"".First, while they are topo maps, there is little altitude information on the actual contours- you can only determine altitude by finding a peak or opther point with a stated altitude, and count the contours to your point of interest.Second, these topo maps have NO lat/long information. In todays world, where many folks have GPS units in their car, RV, or backpacks, this makes no sense at all. This is a serious failing and why I feel the book is outdated."
1,Maps Old and Outdated,Do not buy these maps unless you just like to collect old maps. The publishing date on the map I got was 1990. That means these maps were made before my wife was born!! This company should not be trusted and should really be removed from Amazon as they are not a trustworthy company.
3,fun but not for hot weather,"this toy was fun to use with a mother and daughter team, but for use in hot weather in hawaii the flowers stuck together"
2,Not the Best Ball,Balls lost their stiffness after 2 weeks of use with a ball machine. The other brand of balls purchased are still somewhat stiff and have a much better and even bounce.
1,Ugh.... these are terrible!,"Maybe I got a bad batch, but these were nearly flat right out of the bucket. After a few uses they became heavy and limp. They might give you the best bang for the buck, but you get what you pay for.spend a little more and buy Wilson US Open balls or Dunlop Grand Prix balls. These are premium match balls, but they stand up well to time and torture.My roommate has been playing for over 20 years, myself only about two years and we've gone through virtually every brand of balls. Avoid Gamma balls.Buy Gamma overgrip though!"
1,bad balls,"These balls are horrible, they don't bounce like regular balls, worse yet once they come up from the ground it does not come up straight, it goes to the sides most of the time."
4,Great price!,"I only use these balls for the bottom of a walker so this review might not be very helpful. They are great for that, but I don't know about ""tennis""."
4,Its a bucket of balls,"There isn't much to write about these balls, they are average quality, the bucket is nice to have and it was a good value. Nothing outstanding or poor quality to write about, due to the ""lightning deal"" I'm giving this 4 stars instead of if I paid more then I would have given it 3."
2,Bad Balls not worth the cheaper price,I purchased 2 buckets for my tennis ball machine. They are no longer firm after 2 hours of use. Other brands used in the same machine are still firm. Price differential does not support better return for the cost of these balls.
1,-50% on Cyber Monday?,"I see this as a Cyber Monday deal and is show's the original price was $19.99 and Cyber Monday price is $29.99? What's up with that? From the looks of the other reviews, looks like its not even worth $19.99!"
2,cute but not as shown,"The bracelet shows as white, but came in yellow. One of the charms is different too. It's a cute bracelet, but the description should advise the difference."
4,Early Beamer Sounds Great,"An enjoyable album of Keola's early solo talent. The vocals aren't as polished as on recent recordings, but you can hear what a great musician he was even in 1972. A few of the tunes are so lovely they were also recorded on later albums: ""The Beauty of Mauna Kea"" , ""Pupu Hinuhinu""."
5,At last! A working Time Management method,"If you are reading this review you probably are very serious about applying Time Management techniques to your work and personal life. Maybe you have already tried several methods, but found that they are not completely satisfactory. Perhaps you even doubt that the complete, well-rounded Time Management method exists at all. Such method does exist, and is described in this book.Other Time Management books are ok in some points, but often incomplete or lacking depth. In this book you will learn a complete, well defined, Time Management system that really makes your life easier. The first day that I was at the office and said to myself ""I have nothing else to do today"" I realized how this world had changed my life!"
5,great time management,If you follow the steps in this book you inbox will be cleaner and your tasks will be managed. It truly reduced stress as long as you stick with it. I have shared this book with several co-workers.
5,Best and most practical book on managing your workflow,"I've read many many books and attended way too many classes on ""time management"" only to wonder what I was doing wrong when I couldn't sustain writer's magic method. That was until I found Total Workday Control. Michael Linenberger has finally developed a practical, real-world approach to managing the workday. It's clear that he gets how today's world in the office works."
5,An absolute MUST HAVE!,"This book is an absolute MUST, and I truly believe should be required reading for both college students and those entering the business world. Michael's simple, common-sense techniques go far beyond being organized and effective at work, but I believe fall into the category of `life skills'. While his first version was outstanding, this book goes well beyond those strategies. I most strongly recommend this book for both those who missed his first book, as well as those who read it."
5,Love this book,I'm in the military and change jobs all the time. The task and email management system he pushes is really great truly great.I have purchased this book 4 times over the past 5 years. One for a friend and the rest because I am dependent on the task management system the author advocates and the movers keep losing the darn thing. I finally bought it for my Kindle!
4,Very Helpful & Insightful,"Allows you to take a step back and start rating what is important to you, and helps you prioritize what needs done when, so you have time to spare and use for other things."
4,Interesting and Helpful Concept,"Not only do I love the book, but I bought copies for some of the managers in the companies that I manage, so they could use the same concept. If you get frustrated with feeling like you aren't getting your tasks done on time, this is the book for you. The idea is instead of using a fictional due date that you'd like to get something done, you plan on when you would like to start it. Breaking your tasks into what you want to get done today, what need to be done within a week and what is farther out. After starting this process I can honestly say that I am more productive... and after those pesky interuptions I don't stare at my desk for a half hour trying to get my arms around what I need to do. I just go to my Outlook To Do section and everything is right there! Well worth the money and the best thing is you can get up and running after reading just the first 4 chapters... and chapter 3 is about how to configure your computer. Easy read, easy to maintain!!! LOVE IT!"
5,Fantastic Book! One week in and already far less stress!,"I've practiced David Allen's system for about a year now, but still couldn't get the ""techy"" end of it working smoothly. After only a week on Michael's system, my stress level is low, I'm leaving the office at the end of the day with my Daily Task list empty, and my inbox flutters around 5-6 items (previously getting my inbox under 100 was an accomplishment). Michael walks you step-by-step through the implementation of the system. My only words of advice: If you're going to do it, commit 100% -- do not ease up or the inherent trust you have in the system will collapse."
3,Outlook mastery,"This book helps teach you some great tips on how to use Outlook and it's task area more effectively. I learned some great tips on the system. Overall, It is a bit complicated and honestly just easier to keep a task list on paper (I carry a small folio with mine...) Enjoyed the book though - it's a scan read, not a line by line read."
4,A good update to the original,I found this update version easier to used than the original. I use the ClearContext plug-in for Outlook.
5,Very Helpful,I've used more than one planner system and several different software tools and I find this approach to be the most helpful and most effective. Michael combines his unique way of using Outlook with the time management principles taught by people like David Allen and Stephen Covey to provide an effective approach to time management and personal effectiveness.
3,Screen shot quality is very poor in Kindle edition,"This is probably a great book and I'm anxious to get my paper copy from Amazon. Beware, in the Kindle version the Outlook screen shots are very poor quality and not readable; the text is fine. If you want this in the Kindle version wait until the publisher responds to Amazon with an improved version. Otherwise, order the paperback as I did."
3,Great methods but sometimes painful read,"This book has some great information and recommended methods that were useful to me as someone who did not previously file emails and use tasks efficiently. However, the book is massive in comparison to its substance, and I agree with another reviewer the book could have been much more effective (and efficient!) in just 50 pages or less. A great deal of material was presented over and over again in multiple chapters and having to reread or skip that plus the information for other Outlook versions that didn't apply to me (Microsoft 2003/2007/2010/2011 and Mac versions are all included in this book) was sometimes painful."
5,I'm a best practices convert!,"This book has completely changed my outlook use, for the best! My inbox is no longer an infinite scrolling list of emails that I think I've read, but I'm not sure ... I'm no longer afraid to delete an old email, and I'm confident that my tasks aren't slipping through the cracks. The book is easy to follow, using step-by-step instructions, but the author never sounds patronizing nor does he ""dumb it down"""
4,Helpful!,"I am about two-thirds of the way implementing the full system outlined in this book, but am starting to see real improvement. I am able to track tasks, follow up with tasks and focus on the priority for each day, which helps me leave work feeling I have addressed the 'must dos' rather than being unsure of what I should be working on. I was even able to get my email inbox down to 12 emails on Friday! I look forward to working the system more thoroughly to be even more productive.I researched and downloaded many different task management systems and was excited to see a book focused on Outlook, as that is what I use at work. I can keep a copy of everything on my Palm and then sync it to my Mac at home. I'm thrilled to use just one system for all my computers, at work and home. This is the first task management system that is simple enough to use and sophisticated enough to be effective that has really worked for me."
3,A little overpriced,Item was just as described. I thought the price was a little high but I needed it and could not find it at the local home improvement stores.
2,Math Book With No Example-Problems or Sample-Illustrations,"I thought the book did a poor job of explaining cost comparisons and comparing equations (p27-29) to a new student looking at slope intercept for the first time. Well let me rephrase that. The book makes no attempt to explain this or other concepts with examples that I am used to seeing in other math books. Obviously, this is a supplementary text to a classroom lecture, but what if my kid was sick that day and the instructor isn't around? Then that leaves me, the parent, searching the Internet for answers since the book doesn't provide them.I also went to the publishers web site which was of no help."
4,Creation-'Complete Collection 2:Biff Bang Pow'(Retroactive),"Another lesser known short lived British psychedelic band that existed only from 1966-68.Tracks that make this compilation CD worth your time are ""Biff Bang Pow""(disc has two versions),""Painter Man""(disc has three different versions),Dylan's cover of ""Like A Rolling Stone"",""Midway Down"" and The Leave's ""Hey Joe"".Line-up:Kenny Pickett(R.I.P.)-vocals,Eddie Phillips&Ron Wood-guitars,Rob Gardner-bass and Jack Jones-drums.Might appeal to fans of Smoke,Small Faces,The Action,Pretty Things,Q 65,early Kinks and Five Day Week Straw People."
2,Good songs in a bland pop format,"Amadou & Mariam have done plenty of great recordings but alas this isn't one of them. What's worse is, I suspect that the shortcomings on SOU NI TILE aren't even their fault. The arrangements here don't suit their music; their songs are best delivered in a spare guitar-and-voice style. I can do without the synthesizers, horn sections and background choruses. Check out their earlier material to get to the true essence of this duo."
2,A simple spin off the same information.,Nothing very vitally different other then adding the power of the flame to Reiki.
2,disappointment a fire,"I brought the book mainly to start working with the fire element in my healing with Reiki, crystals, and visualization. It really seemed to be scattered in its concept and in a big way, too easy. I had an attunement in this medium as well and liked my Usui Reiki attunements much more.Ms. AMber"
2,When Your Book Title Is a Lie...,"When Your ""Lover..."" Is a Liar should be titled ""When Your MAN Is a Liar..."" The author is a women's advocate who only mentions men as liars and women as victims. She should have known better than to use a deceptive title given the nature of the book but probably didn't want to limit sales. Shame on her for lying and deceiving her readers.Besides the obvious hypocrisy the issue is that when men escape from abusive, sociopathic women and then buy this book they're traumatized by feminist ""men can do no right; women can do no wrong"" dogma. The author, given her background, knows this; she just isn't willing to lose sales to prevent it. Maybe she'll insert herself as a case study into the next edition.The reason I didn't give this book one star is a lot of the information is really good. Had it presented in a gender-neutral way -- as the title strongly implies it is -- this would have been a solid five-star book."
4,Bought This,"I bought this book for someone I don't even know. On a whim. I never gave it to her. I read it, just because I had it and I read everything.If you have someone in your life who has deceived you, it's a good, healing, understand-yourself book."
5,Wonderful book for help with betrayal,"This book is truly a godsend to anyone dealing with the emotional upheaval of betrayal, whether it's infidelity or any other kinds of betrayal. It gives believable scenarios and concrete examples of what you should do in order to free yourself from the burden of dealing with a habitual liar. As to the gentleman who complained about sexism, the author clearly states at the very beginning that the book is written for women. I hope no one is put off my his ridiculous comments -- this book is a jewel!"
4,Excellent book,"Sometimes we know we are being lied to, but as the saying goes, we can't see the forest for the trees. We want so desparately to save our relationships that we make excuses and keep our heads buried in the sand. This book will open your eyes (if you are ready to have your eyes opened). I wish we women weren't so gullible and eager to swallow the B.S. that our men feed us. This book is a must read if you are trying to come to terms with the deception that lies below the surface your relationship."
1,yoga practionaer,"The book is a big disappointment - it is a collection of fragmented statements and not necessarily articulates Egyptian yoga philosophy and practices that lead to samadhi and enlightenment. I do not understand why every page provides comparison with Indian God/godde3sses and Yoga practices. Author mentions that he is not trying to prove that Egyptian Yoga predates any other practices. In spite of that, the author, continues to compare Egyptian Yoga with other on every page, hence the focus on the subject is lost. Also suggest that they need better editorial review and republish for readability."
4,Great book,"Great read even though it contains a few grammatical errors, but the content is well wriitten."
1,Item was returned-still waiting refund,"This item was ordered for a person in a correctional institution in Milton, Florida. Clinemac1 was the seller but because the seller is not a store but someone who lives in an apartment and sent the book with the apartment number as part of the return address,it was rejected by the prison after the 7 day return policy had expired and returned to me. I thought I was ordering the book from a store. Nevertheless, the book was received by the seller over a week ago and I have heard nothing. That will be my last purchase from Amazon. I don't want to make that mistake again.Judy Thompsongoldenopportunities@netzero.net(904) 568-8231"
5,"Cheesy, but effective","Ok, once you get past the cheesiness of the instructor, and the horrid clothes they are all wearing, these exercises are great! I can tell a difference in my body in only 4-5 hours of doing the video. Something I was extremely skeptical about, but after doing it myself and seeing results, I'll watch that cheesy lady as much as I need to! (Once you get to know how to do the exercises without her explanations, you can just mute it and use the video for the counters provided.) I like the fact that it is broken up into two manageable segments, and if you want a longer workout, do both. But as a mom that works part time, I just couldn't always find time to do the 1 hour video. The deep muscle exercises are great and you'll feel it the next day. I don't do this nearly as often as I should, but I love the quick results when I do!"
5,By a writer of considerable promise and ability,"Ghosts of Fire by Maureen Morah Smith is the suspenseful story of arson, and a man accused of a horrific crime. Zealously persecuted by a mad dog prosecutor, Robert Calloway is trapped on all sides and only his daughter Rachel can struggle to save him, even as she risks losing her heart to a new love, the cynical, justice-driven Nick Hunter. Meanwhile, a malefic stranger in the darkness has further evil plans in store. A haunting, suspenseful story, Ghosts Of Fire is confidently recommended reading and documents Mauren Morah Smith as a writer of considerable promise and ability."
3,Good if you are ready,This product was recommended to me by a friend who did experience past life regression and found it a gratifying experience. I am not so good at achieving a meditative state and failed altogether. The tape itself seemed fine and I hope to have it work for me in due course.
4,Very helpful diagrams and directions.,This has lots of wonderful ideas to help decorate your home the way you want it to be. It has lots of diagrams and helpful directions.
3,Too short for the size,"Amazon should state the length which I feel is too short for a 1/2"" dowel, Probably worth your time to buy a hardwood dowel and make your own custom lengths....And save $$$"
1,"Be careful, they are shorter than the picture !","This is more a negative commentary on Amazon's web page. It is partially my fault for not digging deeper, but the length of the dowels is not listed and the picture is very deceptive. By looking at the picture, assuming the dowel is a 1/2 inch diameter, one would expect the dowel to be at least 3"" long. It turns out they are just under a 1 1/2 inches long.They do not look like the picture !!I could try to return them and Amazon is usually very good about that, but it is not worth my time. In this case ""brick and mortar"" would have won."
4,Crimson Garden Comforter,Great quality comforter - picture indicates a beige background - expect more of a golden color. WE LOVE IT!! Big and fluffy - great value - saw it at Macy's for $450.00!!
5,Folk rock meets very Hip Pop,"The songs these two have written talk about my life, your life, life in America. I've seen them perform in Nashville a few times and have never been disappointed!! They are just as witty, thought-provoking and fun as their music is. Don't miss them!!!!"
1,It's not Part 2,"This is really stupid. I have the japanese version of SC 5 Part 2 - Same art cover, except this one is direct port of dreamcast version which released three years ago. They only changed minor things like music, few more stages."
4,Help me Ulala!,"Up Down Left Right - Cho Cho Cho.This game is just as fun as I remember it - and now my kids are improving their eye/hand coordination with great funky techno beats. They even dance to the music - and on rainy winter days, this is a must have for kids age 12 and under. Help me Ulala! Momma can't get enough."
3,Where it all began...,"Originally titled ""What About Me"", ""THERE GOES MY EVERYTHING"" is Anne Murray's first album, originally released in 1968 on Canada's tiny Arc label.The folk arrangements bring the acoustic guitar to the foreground, and Murray's confident vocals show that she was already fully developed as a singer.""There Goes My Everything"" ventures into folk-rock territory, but most of the music, which includes songs by Tom Paxton and Joni Mitchell, is in the tradition of the Canadian folk scene associated with Gordon Lightfoot and Ian & Sylvia.Murray's mature performances make her debut nearly as appealing as her better-known major-label recordings.(Pickwick was the first of many labels to reissued her Arc recordings for the American market.)"
3,Great price; no comfort,"This worked for my father, but not as well as we had hoped. The picture is misleading. There is no toilet ""seat"" on the actual commode. The lid is down in the picture. Once the lid is lifted, the seat (which is the bucket) has all these edges that my father said was painful and uncomfortable to sit on. At that point, however, we had no choice but to keep it. It worked as a short-term solution (as we needed it only for a for a limited time), but for long-term use, consumers should search for a more comfortable option."
5,Fantastic Fatback,"Marvellous, beautiful, fantastic!!!Fatback is one of the best funk names of the 80's."
3,Non sterile packaging,"This is something I keep in my jump bag and hope to never have to use. I was a little surprised that they were not in sterile packaging, but I guess it is not that important to have airways be sterile. If you need to use one then they probably are in bad shape already. The airways come in the expected sizes and look like they would do the trick. A simple tool to help keep the airway open, it is hard to mess this product up."
4,Does the job,"Pros:* Multiple Sizes.* Inexpensive.Cons:* All sizes are the same color so it takes a little longer to choose the correct one.* Not really made to be used multiple times. This is a disposable Item.Comments:I have not had the opportunity to use these in real life yet. They work ok on a training manequin but they are not super sturdily built so there is the potential for breakage with multiple uses. This is not a real detractor because, in real life, these would only be used one time before being discarded unless you are operating in a 3rd world country or a survivalist scenario where medical supplies are not readily replaced. For those situations, purchase some OPA's that are better constructed and can be sterilized for reuse. Or, you can just buy a bunch of these to have spares."
1,Puleaze!,"Why, oh why do great bands insist on recording what was originally meant to be played loud and proud, music, un-plugged? These are excellent bands and I still shell out my hard earned dollars to see them live. This smacks of the old genre killing MTV days. A very disappointing collaboration from among the musically great ones."
5,So excited these are available on Amazon!,"We had this whole collection when we were kids and our parents sold them in a garage sale to our great disappointment. We've thought about how much we enjoyed these books as kids and wished we still had our copies. Just found them here and I'm giving them to my siblings for Christmas. So excited! The paperbacks are good quality - they seem to be ""hardier"" than I remember them being back in the day. Covers are thick shiny cardstock and not paper thin. Colors are vibrant and clear."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The annual contest to award the best druid title is on again. Getafix of course is going, and Asterix decides to go along to watch out for him. A good thing, too, as the Goths capture Getafix, after seeing how useful his magic potion is.This involves Asterix and Obelix doing a lot of the disguise thing and sowing dissent and confusion in many a land."
4,ASTERIX AND THE GOTHS,Yet another wonderfull asterix book for you all to read they are amazing books and i strongly reccomend them to all ages.This book was great a really good story line...very witty and amusing
3,skydiver,i recieved this toy and it is fun. the parachute works well and as with other action man toys it is very durable and nothing ripped or broke. i guess it was kinda educational because it showed you how a parachute worked. i had two problems with it. 1-the little strap things were cheesey i would have liked a parachute bag and it took forever to fold it up and put it in there 2-he dropped too fast. either he needed to be lighter or the parachute needed to be bigger.
2,LEG BROKE OFF IN 2 DAYS,"THIS TOY WAS GREAT FOR THE FIRST 5 FLIGHTS BUT THEN FELL APART, HAD A LEG BREAK OFF THEN AN ARM IN LESS THAN AN HOUR, IF IT WAS MORE DURABLE WOULD BE GREAT FUN."
4,request for information,"I haven't received this book yet, and would be grateful if you could help me find out what happened to my order!!"
4,Very Practical,"I thought that this book contained an informative behind the scenes look at the orthopedic world. Although I believe that many are not out to simply get you in surgery, I'm sure there are a good portion that are and this book will give you cues on how to spot a happy cutting surgeon. This book will also awaken you to the fact that the doctor is merely a human being, sometimes making educated guesses into your condition.I love the author's approach and direct writing style. This book gives some information about virtually any knee problem that can arise. Most likely it will affirm you to wait, try some exercises and see how it feels. It will also give you ideas on questions to ask the doctor, as well as give you a thorough understanding of the anatomy of the knee (as of 2002)."
4,Good Time Traditional Rock and Roll,"This is a great album of beautifully lyrical, well-crafted songs. The mixture of male and female vocals works to perfection and the stripped down folk-rock playing is first rate. This is a fantastic album (the lyrics really are fantastic -- listen to 'Georgia' or 'South of Home'). Anybody looking for a more intellectual Hootie and/or brilliant female vocals, look no further. This is a great stuff! ."
2,Repeat - inflated price,"I found the volume 5 had much of the same information found in the Volume 2 that I had previously purchased. The price was ten times as high as Vol. 2, but I learned nothing new. I've since returned the materials and am continuing my search for an item showing rarity of older expansion sets."
5,Fire Someone,"Lacking the kitsch that can spoil music, this disc is great fun. However, the producers/engineers must have thought it would be cool to make it sound like it's coming through an AM radio. It's not."
5,Bourbon on the Rocks,"If Jerry Lee Lewis and Keith Richards had a two-headed love child, this is what he'd sound like.The real deal."
1,Buyer Beware,"I give this one star not because I dislike the album. In fact it is amazing and I encourage all my friends to buy it. However, the album you are looking at above is the TVT version and is now out of print. Metropolis Records is re-releasing this album on March 6th with an additional bonus track. You can find the pre-order by doing a search for Nihil.Get this album only if you are a completest. Otherwise get the new version like I am."
1,"No Thanks, I'll stick to Skinny Puppy","I tried my best to like this album, honestly I did, but it never stuck with me. There are a few songs that have some great instrumentation but I couldn't stand the vocals OR I love the vocals but couldn't stand the music. I'm not going to admit to having an objective opinion when it comes to KMFDM as this is the first thing I ever purchased from them and was really disappointed. So you might like it, you might not. It's not my cup of tea and I can't say much about it. I found it bland and unoriginal, just a bunch of noises lumped together mingling with horrible vocal treatments. Skinny Puppy is better..ahem.."
4,Doin' it again and again and again ...,"This release shows a bit of a turn in KMFDM's sound, one that has persisted on the group's latter two efforts as well. The industrio/metal/funk group essentially ups the production, making the songs thick and multi-layered, like it never has before. Lyrical genious it ain't, and musical innovators they will never be, but a truly enjoyable feast it is. KMFDM don't inhabit a complex world of duality or etheral musings, (you won't find any NIN-help-me-i'm-so-miserable rants on this album) and they make no bones about it. KMFDM is a punk band at best, and just a bunch of punks at worst. If you like massive beats intertwined with metal riffing, crooning female vocals and aggressive male shouting and grumbling of degradation at its finest, than dig in. Welcome to the world of KMFDM, where the black and white only greys when trying to make sense of their album covers, which are great by the way."
4,My initiation to industrial,This cd is great it hooked me onto the industrial genre.But xtort is theirs best cds.
3,Some good songs,"This is the third KMFDM album I have bought. I also own Adios and the symbols album. Overall, I'm a bit disappointed with Nihil. Disobedience and Brute are very good, and there are a few other tracks that are good, but the rest is quite mediocre. My favourite album is still the symbols one. If you prefer songs that sound more like music than noise, you will probably like the symbols album more than Nihil. Two of the songs from Nihil (Juke Joint Jezebel and Brute) also appear on Retro-a KMFDM compilation album.Sonic quality on this album is a little higher than one might expect for this type of music. Nevertheless, soundstaging is limited, and the overall sound is rather lacking in depth. I guess not too many people listen to this type of music on high end audio equipment."
3,It still dissappoints me,"I purchised this album the year it was released. I had owned many KMFDM releases already and arrogantly thought I knew what to expect from a Kmfdm album. Kmfdm is my favorite industrial band so dont take what I'm about to say the wrong way. I hadn't listened to more than ten minutes when a thought popped into my head. ""What the h**l is this? "" I consider myself very open minded but something about this album rubbed me the wrong way. Trust, Revolution, Disobediance,and Search&Destroy were the only tracks I could stand for months after I bought it. Its been five years and I still can't listen to the whole album all the way through. For those who recommend this as the first of KMFDM's albums to buy I have to disagree. Make up your own minds. Sorry Sascha, Esch, and the whole gang. I just didn't like this one."
3,maybe if they never put their feet in their mouths...,"i just can't get into this band no matter how i try. i love industrial, but KMFDM never did much for me. their music does certainly have its interesting moments, but their lyrics are downright abysmal. i know they have a sense of humor and most fans love that. however, i just can't take them seriously, even when it seems required. their message is overdone and any attempts they make at shock value are simply childish. perhaps if they (or perhaps i should say their new incarnation) made an instrumental album, it would be decent."
3,Buy it for Ultra,"Ultra is the reason to buy this one, despite many of the other songs having acclaim."
5,THE BEST INDUSTRIAL ALBUM EVER MADE!,"Just buy this album regardless your taste in music, be it industrial, metal, punk, whatever. This is my favourite album of all time, my desert island disk, everything. Ultra is the best song they have ever done and my favourite track of all time too. Just watch it being played on Street Fighter 2 (the animated movie), when Chun lei battles Vega. It's totally phenomenal, the atmosphere, everything. The track Juke Joint Jezebel gave them a big name too, as it was featured in the Mortal Kombat movie and being a tremendous track too. All the other 8 tracks on this album are killer too, you just can't go wrong with this album anyway shape or form. Do yourself a favour and buy it, you won't regret it if you have any taste.A masterpiece."

5,10 speed cassette by shimao,Hard to screw this one up. It does what it should. Never been let down by a Shimano bike product.
3,"""Collectors"" Beware","The remastered RVG edition of Miles Davis' ""Collectors Items"" offers new liner notes and improved sound, but little else. Three songs (plus an alternate take of ""The Serpent's Tooth"") from 1953 with Charlie Parker and Sonny Rollins, and three more from 1956 with just Sonny, but unfortunately all of them are on Sonny'sThe Complete Prestige Recordingswhich I already own. I knew there was a reason why I hadn't bought this previously :-("
2,Boring,"This book was boring. There's nothing like reading stories about other people's first years teaching in predictable situations and predictable insights on ""what you should be taking away"" from the story. Out of the stories, maybe 1-2 werre actually touching and inspiring."
2,waste of money,"If you own pro tools and you own the manuel, this book is a waste of your time and money. You can purchase the ProTools Manuel for the same price from Digidesign, and get more info."
1,Producing in the Home Studio with Pro Tools,"Don't waste your time or money. This book will not show you how to use Pro Tools. Most of the book is dedicated to music business related stuff. If you want general information on how to become a record producer this book is for you. If you want to learn how to use the software program, this book is not for you."
4,lots of good information,"this book reads more like a manual and covers a lot of information. However, for a beginner it is worth the price because you will come away with some critical and time saving information"
2,3rd Addition Needed for Berklee Course,"I purchased this book thinking it was the one I needed for my Berklee Class, but realized it was the outdated edition only after it arrived and my classes had begun. This is the second edition, the third edition is available directly from Berklee."
2,"Use the Pro Tools Reference guide, not this book","This book gives you a general overview only. In most situations I had to refer to the Pro Tools reference guide to get a detailed explanation in order to do what needed to be done. Yes, the reference guide is 650 pg plus. But you can easily browse through bookmarks to find the topic you are looking for.I guess, if you have no idea what you are doing, and don't know what to look for in the reference guide in the first place, this book could direct you there when needed.I have also taken some on line Berklee Music classes with this author, but that is a completely different structure. Great class if you can afford it."
1,Bad dog !!,"...The reason I bought the book was because the manual provided with Pro Tools is a reference manual and I was in search of a ""how to"" guide with useful examples and real-world applications. And I'm still looking! This book simply mimicks much of what is convered in Digidesign's supplied reference manual and adds little additional content except for an odd emphasis on the producer and engineer's role in the preproduction and production process. And frankly I bought the book as a Pro Tools primer, not as a generalization of the production and engineering process---there are books far better than this which are dedicated to those topics. Additionally, the ""bonus CD"" included with the book is the equivalent of a ""bonus"" copy of AOL --- nothing more than a copy of Digidesign's ""Pro Tools FREE"", available as you would expect FOR FREE from their web site. As in music, books are subjective so you may glean far more than I from this book. Just buy at your own risk (or buy mine used...)."
3,Just sorta OK...,"If you want an in-depth, ""how-to-use ProTools"" manual, this book doesn't cut it. There is very little in-depth examination of any one topic, and more emphasis on providing a little bit about a lot of stuff. Also, there's waaay too much content about ""the audio business,"" case in point is Chapter 10, The Producer's Role in Production. Personally, I don't think it's time well spent to be looking in a book for tips on creating your own mixing/production style...If you're new to ProTools (and recording in general) and in need of an overview of the program and its capabilities, buy this book. If you're looking for a technical reference handbook, read the ProTools manual."
1,Not what I expected,"I agree with other reviews. Too much info. on production, types of mics to use, where to place instruments, etc. All I wanted to know was how to use Pro Tools. This book didn't do it. It gives some pretty basic info. on ProTools. I was looking more for a ""How To"" book that would explain how to do a session from start to finish. If it walked you through doing a track, how to patch sub-tracks, more in-depth of editing tracks, ""bouncing"" to CD, what to do, what not to do... it just was not what I expected. Maybe I'll write my own book on this since I've run into other user's who are just as frustrated with trying to learn this software."
2,ron from Va.,Hole size is too large for most flush mount receptacles. Should have said diameter size in the discription. Might find a use one day.
5,Another great soundtrack from Martin Scorsese,"Martin Scorsese's latest film, ""Bringing out the Dead"" has all the elements of his style of film. Which also includes an absolutely wonderful soundtrack. It opens up with Van Morrison's 9 1/2 minute ""T.B. Sheets"" which hauntingly plays throughout the film. Most of the reamainder of the album is an unusual yet fascinating mix which has a wide range from The Clash to Martha Reeves and the Vandelles. The oddest track on the cd is ""Bell Boy"" from the Who which might sound strange to those who haven't heard the ""Quadrophinia"" album. Yet it's a great CD and a great movie. Scorsese has done it again!"
4,Great Soundtrack,"A great Scorcese soundtrack. Yes, the entirety of the music in the film was better, but this is a great collection that goes together nicely."
2,Where's Elmer?,"In promoting his film, Bringing Out the Dead, Martin Scorsese made a big deal out of having Hollywood soundtrack giant Elmer Bernstein on hand to do the original score. Elmer's name is on the credits crawl, his music is certainly in the film, so why is he not featured on this skimpy, 12-cue CD? If the actual film had contained only these MTV hand-me-downs, it would have passed as a Michael Mann movie, not a Scorsese masterpiece. Are we going to see a separate CD of Elmer's music a la Wild Wild West?"
1,they left out the best,"why did they exclude the best song in the movie? ""These are Days"" Natalie Merchant........I hate it when they leave out songs that were in the movie when they put out the soundtrack."
1,Bringing out the dead is quite dead,Im sorry but the cds got to go. Hey man. I use to like Van Morrison and all btu hes got to go girlfriend. The cd was okilly dokilly but I thought it was a bit schmemish myself. If you want a good cd then I suggest acid rock. Party on dude.
1,Bad misprint,"A word of forewarning for this review: I don't know if my results are typical. I ordered this book for a college project on video game rhetoric. I was reading through the book, only gleaning occasional useful information. Finally, I struck a gold mine in Ch 10, which very explicitly focuses on how simulations can persuade. I finished the end of the chapter, thrilled to continue on to the next two chapters, which from the titles looked to be just as useful. Unfortunately, THEY WEREN'T THERE! The next page after 234 is page 139. Again. Over forty pages of the book are duplicated. If that isn't enough, when it finally gets back to the right page, it picks up on page 267. So not only was I ripped off for thirty pages of the book, they just so happened to be the chapters I needed. Just my luck. I want my money back. More importantly, I WANT TO READ THOSE DANG CHAPTERS!"
3,It works,Purchase this product for my Nokia 6126 cell phone. The fit is very snug.Difficult to put the phone into it at first. The cover sometime interferes with the power cable when I plug it into the phone. You have to push it aside or remove the top part of the cover to insure you get a good connection to power the cell phone. But it does work. It protect the phone and clips onto my belt.
3,"""So So"" Case.....","Gave this a try based on the Amazon picture alone. Thinner than I expected. Fit is ""OK"". Just not as sturdy as the OEM unit I was used to. The nice thing is at least it gives me a slim profile and DOES have clear plastic to protect the OUTER screen on my Nokia 6126."
5,X-F Rocks,This album shows the different styles that Sascha incorporates into his music. It also show how he collaborates with other musicians and uses their imput. The album starts with more dancelike vibes and then crushes you with Angst-like tracks near the end. Worship Me and Finger on the Trigger are comparable to A Drug Against War. While Conquer Your World is like later KMFDM efforts such as Power and Megalomaniac. Definitely a must for any KMFDM or TKK fan.
2,Not terribly impressive.,"I ordered the Tribeca 2 GB flash drive to supplement a 1 GB flash drive, used primarily for photo back up. Because of its thickness, I had to remove my other USB devices from the over/under USB ports on the front of my machine. The rubber casing is a bit too long and the drive does not stay connected all that well. While copying over the pics, the data became completely scrambled. I ran a check disk against it, and found some bad sectors, which had caused the problem."
1,Handle with care,"it says rugged but after carrying it in my bag for 3 months it fell apart. I didn't have performance issues like mentioned above, until of course it fell apart and became unusable. I'm currently trying to locate the manufacturer's contact info so I can submit a waranty claim."
1,Not even 5 months,This product was a Christmas gift and now it doesn't even work. It's only April! 4 months of operation.... I don't recommend this product
4,Magic Quilted Mandalas,This book presents an interesting twist on quilting (pun most definitely intended since each of the quilts seems to undulate with a life of its own). The directions are clear and the pictures wonderful. I would suggest this as an alternative for any quilter who is bored with triangles and squares.
2,Could this order take longer?,"This order was made with the rest of the Volumes that come along with this book; yet this hasn't arrived. The other books came earlier than expected, but this book has being delayed. This book is not for me; is for my Fiancée, she adores this books. If it was up to me I wouldn't care when this books arrive. But my Fiancée cannot finish reading the rest of the volumes because she need the third one."
5,A Practitioners Bible,The author does an excellent job at explaining technically challenging concepts clearly and consisely along with easy to replicate examples. Book is ideally for all practioners producing / selling /consulting on financial products. The author should be congratulated for such a superb effort
2,Spiderman,"My son LOVEs bug and go this from Santa last year, I didn't like that the lid doesn't stay on well and can fall off easily not recommended to use in the house for this reason. Also if bugs get left in it they can climb under the decorative scene and hard to remove if they die it really makes it stink and can not be taken apart at all to be cleaned. Would like to see a better cap and something you can move around to clean out once in a while."
4,"It's ""MU"" with a different cover and title","See reviews of ""M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull"" for more in-depth reviews of this CD. It's a very good collection of Tull classics from their 1969 second LP through the major chart success of WarChild in 1974, including several staples of what is now called ""Classic Rock""--and a couple of durable Top 20 hits in ""Living in the Past"" and ""Bungle in the Jungle."" This came out in the middle of Tull's long 70s heyday, but before 1977's Songs from the Wood LP put Tull back on the commercial map as an excellent folk-rock outfit (emphasis on the rock). Highly recommended in any form, under any title."
3,OAAAAAAAAA - evil laugh!,the book is alright. a few classic monsters are there. it seems with all these step by step books you can follow them up until the last panel wear it actually looks like a monster! practice practice practice
2,Not for kids...,"This book is only so-so as a drawing book, whether for beginners or more advanced artists. The pictures are weird, and not aesthetically pleasing, even for monsters. However, this is definitely not a book for kids. The pictures are frightening enough to give kids nightmares. Think horror. Not a very useful book."
5,The scorpio society is asome,I coundn't put the book down after I started reading it. The idea of a hidden colt in a privite school is such a cool idea for a storie. Carol Ellis did a great job writing this. It was so good I finshed it in one day. I think everyone should read this book even if they don't like reading.
3,Nice cookbook,"While this is a nice little cookbook, I've only tried maybe one or two recipes. It just didn't inspire me. I'm sure I'll get it out again, but it wasn't one that I keep going back to, like I do with many others."
2,not for me,I have to say that if you have all of the attachments this book is great but I don't so it is not for me. Besides there are no pictures showing what the items should look like.
2,Did not like the recipes...,"While there are many different recipes in this cookbook that give inspiration to using your mixer, most recipes were something my family would never eat, or they required ingredients I would not easily have in my pantry. Only a few photos of a few recipes. Will make maybe two recipes in this book, if that."
3,Needs more pictures,"I was disappointed that the book had so few pictures. I'd much rather see what I'm about to cook or bake, but that's just me. It's full of good information, but not formatted the way I lime."
2,A very big disappointment,I wish I had paid more attention to the reviewers who expressed disappointment in the book because of the number of recipes that required attachments. I was excited about my Kitchenaid purchase and I was looking for a cookbook that would provide recipes that would help me use the mixer. I don't have the attachments and don't think I will be purchasing them so I feel that I wasted my money on at least half the book. I may change my mind after I try some of the recipes but I am not impressed by the recipes I've read so far. Not worth the money I spent.
4,Good Overview Of All Components Offered:,"Like many have said, this is the best info on all the accessories available and how to use them. I was going to buy the grinder attachment but after reading all the reviews decided not to. This was due to the complaints of ""greyish"" stuff in the meat. Really ??? Fix the damn problem and offer a new perfected product !!! So, I have not ventured further into doing my own grinding of meat/sausage, etc. Disapointing, to say the least. Otherwise a lot of intrest in a lot of other things going on. Probably would buy for someone that I knew recieving a new stand mixer. I spent a lot of time reviewing the accessories in the comment section in Amazons website. Buyer Beware...But so nice to have an honest opinion stated. Like many recipes online, review the comments and see if it is worth the venture. Please enjoy your new stand mixer. It is worth it !"
5,Great Cookbook!,This is an awesome cookbook. Lots of great recipes. My kids have had a blast with it!
5,Must Have,"I'm sure someone who is a ""real"" chef would be disappointed with this, but for someone who just loves to cook and wants to get full use out of their mixer (like me) will be thrilled! I can't wait to try out every single recipe. I don't think there was one that didn't look great to me."
5,The Mixer Bible. The only book you'll need for your KitchenAid Mixer!,"I rec'd this book and tried the ""Rosemary Focaccia with Tomatoes and Fresh Mozzarella"" recipe. The recipe turned out perfect and it taste awesome! We ended up making another one the next day and another perfect one. This book has great recipes. Can't wait to try other recipes in this book."
5,mixer bible,"This mixer bible was the second part of the anniversary present. I've looked through this and the recipes look yummy! We're excited to use it as I really like the ""side notes"" on the pages. Those will help alot in substituting and measuring."
4,bible,this is a good book I've learned a lot from it good recipes I tried a lot of the and there pretty good worth the money spent.
3,A comprehensive compendium,While this book has a lot of recipes I found none of them particularly inspiring. Nevertheless its a good start if you don't already have a mixer cookbook.
3,half crap-- half great,well the foods are a waste unless you own every attachment on the planet and love fancy cooking.Now on the other hand I couldn't be more thrilled with the second half on cakes and cookies. Great recipes and I have used 3 already and have not had the cookbook long at all.Worth buying for second half.
5,Thorough - good recipes for all attachments,"I am quite pleased with this recipe book. Was actually thinking I would not keep it as I also got the 'Kitchenaid Best-Loved Recipes' (which is also very good) ..., but found there were enough recipes I would like to use in addition to the other book (soups especially) that I kept it. It gives many ideas and suggestions for use of the various Kitchenaid attachments - a great resource."
3,Not what I expected,"Not just titled the bible, many people consider it to be the bible of mixers. Unfortunately, I disagree. I'm not sure what I was expecting- I guess I was looking for new uses for my mixer along with a great set of recipes. There's about 4 pages of tips for using your mixer.Instead most are regular recipes that look for some way to use the mixer- usually when it makes no sense. Take the soups for example. Sorry, I'm not going to use my mixer as a strainer. How about using the mixer to mash your potatoes? No thanks. I've got cheap, easy, and effective hand tools to take care of those tasks.It's not a total loss. The sausage, bread, and dessert sections are great. That's a PRACTICAL use for my mixer. All in all, this is primarily a recipe book with little to do with your stand mixer. The bible, it is not"
2,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to receiving this book and have to say i was very disappointed. I bought a new kitchen aid mixer and anticipated this being a great companion for it - i was wrong. There are NO pictures of any recipes and its a very basic, boring book with info you could find almost anyplace else."
1,"WHAT, NO PICTURES?!","Very disappointing book, as it has no photos of the finished recipes. Just a bunch of grey words that does not make for a good cookbook. I work in book publishing and know that photography - especially food photography - is way more expensive than having an author simply crank out a bunch more words.The result is an uninspiring cookbook with over 300 recipes that are hard to read, and likely to be skipped over, entirely."
2,Just so so,"I'm really disappointed, not to many recipes that I would try. Only one cheesecake recipe :-("
2,Boring - no photos. Decent recipes.,Basic recipes which are ok. Not a single photo makes the book boring. Definately NOT a must have.
4,Why volume in metrics?,"I haven't tried any of the recipes in this book yet, but there seems to be a good mix of everyday vs. gourmet.What bothers me is that on the right-hand side of each recipe are the volume amounts listed in metric. What good is that? Why are the weights not listed where appropriate? Anyone with a modern measuring cup can look on one side or the other for the cup or the ml measurement. What were they thinking? It looks like they were trying to impress someone. Well, it doesn't impress me but rather annoys me."
2,"good cookbook, bad service","I ordered this the same time as the mixer and the mixer was there in 2 days and the cookbook, months later!!! Very frustrating!!"
5,awesome,"This is amazing, and so creative! I love it!A great novelty! and also teaches you something!I showed all of my friends"
5,Just the thing for your therapist friends,"Great gift for your friends who are mental health professionals - much better than the Freud action figure! Every time I look again at this book, I see different funny details, e.g., barbed dental floss, the plane oxygen mask that dispenses goldfish crackers.With Valentine's Day coming up, the Pop-up Book of Sex would be a good choice for one's significant other.The Pop-up Book of Sex;The Pop-Up Kama Sutra: Six Paper-Engineered Variations"
5,The Ultimate Coffee Table Book,"The pop-ups are wild! Incredible detail! These are NOT the same simple pop-ups that we had as children. They are really works of art! The dentist drill actually spins and comes right out at you. And, it's a blast to see all of the different phobias and read the funny, but technical psychological definations."
4,impressive conversation-piece,"fun to show to guests, not fun to have in the house. funny and creative, but a short read."
2,Great Concept but Poor Execution,Purchased this for my mother in-law who collects pop-up books. This book features pretty poor pop-ups and and overall lack of creativity.
3,Underimpressed,"Sure it gives a few phobias. But the almost cliche phobias we are already well aware of. I was hoping for the little known phobias. The really different phobias. This instead gave me snakes, elevators, and public speaking. Underimpressed I sent it back. I'll wait around for a better one..."
5,The most clever and funny book I've read in a very long time,"Beautifully illustrated and written with razor sharp wit, the Pop-Up Book of Phobias is so funny that you'll develop a fear of reaching the end of the book. It's great fun to turn each page and watch several differant phobias come to life right before your eyes. This book will make a great gift,it's probably the most enjoyable coffee table book ever."
5,Welcome to my world,"A must for any neurotic out there.I can visit any of my worst fears at anytime.Oh joy-to have a coffee table book to enjoy, while breathing into a brown paper bag during panic attacks! A magnificant comfort.I've ordered more-but the pack rat in me-well they will be hard to give up. I say one in each room!(what about the phobia of thinking your sweaters on inside out)? hope there are more to come. Thank you"
5,Entertaining gift!,I received this as a gift several years ago and recently purchased it for a friend. I love the inticate pop-ups and the silly write-ups for each malady. :)
1,Broke,"It did not work from the minute that we received it and it cost more to send it back than it was worth, so I just got ripped off."
2,"Review of Intelligent Tennis, by Skip Singleton","This book reads like the first half of a tennis instruction manual. The author describes basic principles for improving your tennis game, but none of the details of grips, tactics, and other practical guidance. Some chapters read more like philosophy than nuts and bolts instruction. Illustrations are few and not particularly helpful. The most useful pages provide an opponent analysis form and a match critique sheet. By itself, this book would not be a sufficient basis for self-help in tennis. Overall rating: two stars."
1,Jay Jay the Jet Plane--Jay Jay's First Flight,Terrible. This is an early one so it is not animated like the ones you're used to--it is just still shots of air plane models that don't move or talk. It's very bad and I thought at first I had bought a bootleg or something. Stick to the new ones.
4,Great quick album,"It's mostly solid from first song to last and it clocks in at time length, 45mins, that doesn't allow you to get tired of it too soon. It's got a few skip-able tracks but overall if I pop this one on, i'm less likely to go back and change it like i do most stuff."
3,Not Nic's best; still better than most!,"BOTTOM LINE:Nic's music is good for cruising at nite or a backdrop to a nice get-together at the crib. This CD is nowhere near the amazing magic of 'Connected', but you can never go wrong with Nicolay! Still enjoyable, still soulful, and it's always a good thing to support (and pay for) GOOD MUSIC!"
4,Smooth Beats,nicolay is an awesome producer and beat makerif u truly are a hip hop junkie u neeeeed to own this album
3,Little Boy Blue come blow your horn,"We originally bought this for a costume. (Little boy blue) My son was excited to get this horn. This horn makes music, but only came with directions to play one song. (the buttons are color coded)If your child likes to make his/her own music--go for it!I would have liked to see a booklet of some common nursery rhyme tunes, so some songs could be learned.Simply just a noise maker for us."
1,broke the first day,I bought two of these for my kids. They desperately wanted them. What a disappointment. They broke almost immediately. They are the flimsiest plastic junk. I wasn't expecting a lot for the price but I expected them not to fall apart in five minutes with proper usage.
2,Not worth the price.,Packaging was horrible and item arrived damaged. Flimsy construction to begin with. Not worth the money at all.
1,If u r lucky play music otherwise place it in showcase,"I bought this toy for my 5 years old son as he wished to have one after watching cartoon, he was very happy once we received the packet.He felt hard to blow to get sound coming out, I tried to help him to teach, but I too became literally tired as the buttons doesn't function well to pass air to give music. One of the button is not working & almost it is a dead one.He hardly played with that for 30 minutes, then it went to toy dump in our home.Appearance is quite good, plastic seems to be good, but not sure about the life of steel finish/coating as we used lesser than 30 minutes.I guess it is a luck to get one which is working properly, but it disappoints children exception which I don't like with this type of product.If you get good one,it is your luck otherwise it is a good showcase toy.This toy has good educational value so I need to give 5 star.I called Amazon and explained the problem, their service was quite good and they refunded me."
5,Love the trumpet!,My four year old son received this children's trumpet for Christmas. He loves to make music and to have parades. This trumpet is the perfect addition to his musical instrument collection. It is easy for him to play and has held up well even though it travels everywhere we go! We are very happy with this purchase.
3,Just what he wanted,"My 3 year old is very IN to music, and really wanted a trumpet for Christmas, just like his Dad's. This one is cool because it does look like a real trumpet. It plays by blowing air though, not by buzzing. And it took my son a little while to get the blowing technique down for some reason. And you have to be pressing one of the keys while you blow for any sound to come out. So he can't just make a bunch of constant noise like I expected him to be able to do. But he seems to really like it so I can't complain."
3,Harmonica trumpet,"This ""trumpet"" sounds more like a harmonica than a trumpet. Does require a valve to be pressed for it to make any sound and can play only four notes alone or all at once. Our daughter loves playing it around the house and it not too annoying."
2,Tutorial in Self-Indulgence,"The only thing more tuneless, repetitive and grating than the Gillan-Blackmore screech/guitar ""duet"" is a...shudder...Jon Lord organ solo. Mommy, make it stop! BTW, doesn't Ritchie do a Renaissance Faire thing now? Blackmore's Night? Ha ha ha - Puppet Show and Spinal Tap!!!"
3,The music is GREAT but................,"Actually I would love to give this CD 4.5 stars for the music alone but I can't get past the fact that in between each song the radio show announcer makes a comment about what was just played as well as introducing the next tune. This occurs on both the first and second CD. I would unreservedly give this CD 4.5 stars if there was only music on this CD. The only reason I wouldn't give the music 5 stars is because, as the band is improvising during the set, it seems that at times they are trying to find the sweet spot without actually lolling around in it. But for the most part they ARE in the stratosphere. I owned the original LP release that had no commentary in between the songs. They should have kept it that way as the announcers comments are insipid and detract from the music. He even chastizes Ian Gillan for introducing one of their own songs, reminding Ian that he is not the shows host. That just ain't Rock N' Roll my Babies."
2,not what i expected,Information was great but I wanted full instruction so I could practice daily. He just gives the basic movements. I would have like a daily routine that I could practice daily.
2,disappointed,I purchased Beginning Tau Chi and it was not what I expected. He only demonstrated the moves but there was not a workout section. If you are looking for a good workout don't buy this one.
3,Complexity Theory and Psychology,"Helene Shulman has done some amazing work in Jungian psychology, especially with regards to Complexity theory. This book is an amazing integration of ritual, shamanism, and meditation in many cultures. A complicated understanding of mental illness and the healing process are the focus of this book. Shulman constantly remindes the readear that because individual is both rational and irrational the process of psychotherapy can be aided by using cross-cultural techniques. The most facinating chapeter are the connections the author makes to the mathematical idea of complexity and psychology. If this idea is interesting perhaps Warren Ashby's ""A Comprehensive History of Western Ethics"" would also be a book to read.adejulio@stumail.sjcsf.edu"
1,it should get a negative rating,This is the worst networking book I have ever read. There is nothing worthwhile in the book. In fact the authors best advice is to go and take the Novell certified courses. If I had the time to do that I wouldn't have bought the book!
5,1st Campout,"I was lucky enough to attend the 1st Camper/Cracker Campout. I had been a fan prior but this weekend made me an addict. i have since seen 28 Cracker and 22 Camper shows.The DVD gives you a taste of what it was. As much as i can appreciate the focus of others (all of which were good, Cracker and Camper Van were the focal points. Deservedly so.The DVD does a nice job splicing together video from various tapings and brought back many memories and highlights. It is well worth buying. And if i may suggest go to Archive.org and download the audio of the show to enjoy it to its fullest.Also, do buy the disk. you will find yourself going back to it often and enjoying it everytime.Cracker at Rockpalast is also well worth owning.peace,Ignatzzz"
4,Floating away..,"This compilation in my opinion is the best of the 5 ""Tranquility"" cd's that were put out by the now defunct Silent Label. And I am not alone. Many radio stations that carry the series usually play selection from this the fourth of the series. I am sure you will enjoy it."
1,There are better books,"This book was a required purchase four our A&P classes. I found too many errors, but most disturbing was the brevity with which the book treated many subjects. Our classes always had to supplement this book with other author's works. Not that I expect one book to cover everything, but the brevity was glaring on many subjects."
3,AMT GA,"Brand new book at a great price, and fast shipping. Transaction went very smooth and well, overall i was very satisfied with the purchase."
3,Works well...when it works,"The vacuum worked well....until it just stopped working. I had only used it 5 times when this happened. I contacted Wagan to get a replacement and they handled it pretty quickly, but I had to ship it to them, which is about half the actual price of the vacuum itself. They have not offered to pay for the shipping."
3,"cute, but food gets caught in the corners","Cute dishes and a good size, but because the inside of the bowl isn't sloped, food gets caught in the corners. If they were sloped, I'd give them 5 stars."
3,Cute dish - ceramic finish cleans up nicely.,"This was one of our very first cat dishes for our 3 felines. It is very cute, and good quality and we still have it, but we have moved on to raised pet dishes - much more comfy for the cat to eat/drink from. Good price though!"
5,VERY NICE,These were bought for our new kitten and they are very nice..and should last for many years..very nice quality item
5,Nice,I ordered two of these and they are very-well made and very cute. I wanted something that is safe for the microwave as I heat the canned food a little bit and these are perfect. Fast delivery!
3,Edmond,"Nicely detailed, but not really meant to be played with. The handles for theshield are flimsy and break off easily. The tab and hole where you place the sheath for the sword is hard to do and not for little hands. It doesn't stay on well either."
5,Important early language study,Early Rus is a difficult area to find good English language studies. This work fills a need for better understanding of language development in the Slavic lands. The books covers a lot of language and time period ground. This cross roads has a number of languages represented and some interesting cultural aspects to consider.One of the more interesting aspects is the small collection of images of these earliest texts. The oldest piece is actually a Hebrew text from Kiev with notations found in the Cairo Genizah collection. The most interesting are the two birch bark letters. One on a dispute over a slave and the other an official apology letter.The section on magic in writing as also quite interesting.
2,Recycled and Mediocre Album,"This album is nothing but mediocre: the production and the artists. The beats try to come off sounding like an impersonation of Dr. Dre's early west coast funk. This is album was sent to me and I am glad that I did not purchase it. Save your money or if you're just a hard core west coast funk fan, this album will leave you wanting A LOT more. Average at best."
1,"A breathlessly silly book, but some good photographs","Many of the underwater photographs are interesting, and some make a great impression, but the text of this book is of the lowest order -- silly, gabbling, breathless, not at all as if by an informed and serious writer. No stars for the author. Nor for the editors and publishers who went for trash when they should have aimed for gold."
5,Mysterious World Recommended Book,"Alexandria: The Sunken City is an top-quality photographic essay of Jean-Yves Empereur's 1995 underwater expedition off the coast of Alexandria, Egypt. There, Empereur and crew found a gold mine of archaeological artifacts, including massive stone sculptures, pillars covered with Egyptian hieroglyphics, and even numerous sphinxes. This now-submerged part of ancient Egyptian history is considered to be one of the greatest archaeological finds of the twentieth century, and Alexandria: The Sunken City covers the subject well in a simply written, lavishly illustrated coffee-table-sized book that is a must have for anyone interested in underwater archaeology, Egyptology, the ancient history of the Mediterranean, and related disciplines."
3,Treasured Friends,"A pretty book, full of gorgeous paintings of children, and sweet poems and remembrances about the subject of friendship. Perfect as a gift to someone who loves beauty, children, and their friends. Would look sweet on a table or shelf. Stirs up fond thoughts of good friends."
2,For diehardcore completists only!,"Been there, done that! All this CD is is a reissue of ""Decade"", the first greatest hits collection from 1989. They have the exact same tracks. If you're more a--l-retentive about getting imports than me, be my guest and buy this. Otherwise, there's the singles box coimng in June with some tracks never officially released on CD, and even better, the classic line-up's reunion (I know it's not the original, they too have had what I call Destiny's Child Syndrome!) later this year."
4,Good introductory book,"I purchased this book because I was looking for material to prepare the PMP certification exam. The book is easy to read and the concepts and key terms are clean and well explained. However, from my point of view, is too shallow to be fully ""effective"". I've been managing software projects for the last 6 years and, after reading the book, I felt that it didn't cover all my expectations, for example, treatment of Critical Chain Project Management is little more than a quote of its existence.Anyway, if you are looking for an introductory book on PM I think is a pretty good book, but remember, to gain more in depth knowledge on particular subject matters you'll have to look at the references."
3,Good material but not enough coverage,This book covers the fundamentals of project management but lacks details. It also lacks simplicity and consistency. The Critical path example discussed on p. 132 to 134 is confounding (especially the part explaining the difference between free and total slack). Better and more lucid examples demonstrating the various topics covered in this book would have made this book a 'standard' must-have.
4,Standard-setting textbook on project management,"This is a substantial, substantive overview of project management. Students could use Robert Wysocki's book as the text for a survey course about various professional approaches to project management. It even includes problems, chapter-by-chapter ""learning objectives"" and case studies. However, professionals will find solid, useful content, as well. Wysocki brings a lot to the table: voluminous information, insights from his decades of experience and clear personal judgments about the various methods he covers. getAbstract recommends this authoritative text to project management practitioners, trainees and students."
5,Good book,It's a good book on project management. I wish it was more in line with the standards from PMI. Also covers some advanced topics such as portfolio management but not in much detail.
4,Good Book,"A good book it covers all phases of Traditional, Adaptive and Extreme project management. It has few chapters on Project services organization. It has very limited information in two areas namely Quality Management and Risk Management."
2,it is not good,The title is very attractive. however the content is more common. maybe it is good for beginner. most of content is focus on Traditional. nothing or very little useful information on Adaptive and etreme. if you want to learn how to deal with the adaptive and extreme project. just buy another one
3,Don't Like it,"In the fist chapter alone it tries to define several terms and fails miserably. Later the book redefines the terms it defined earlier in the book. For example it first defines a resource as ""assets, such as people, equipment, physical facilities, or invintory that have limited availibilities . . . "" (Pg 9).In the next section it simply states ""Resources are any consumables used on the project."" (Pg 9).Define a term once and use it consistantly.A lot of the terms it defines are long winded, and could be shorter. It almsot seems like the author was simply attempting to fill pages."
4,"Legends of Country Music:Classic Hits of the 50's,60's&70's",If you like country music from this era it is a good sample. Many top ten hits.
2,country ledgens,"its only so so for classic hits of classic hits. I would have liked to see more real stars of the 50, and 60,s."
2,BAD sound,Good phone but bad sound (when you make a greeting message interlaced with music) I had to return the unit E.S.
3,Just OK,"I experience a good deal of static while using the telephone. Plus, even with the volume all the way up, I miss parts of the message unless the person leaving the message talks loudly enough so the machine records all of it."
3,It's Okay....,"I was a Shakira fan about a year before she came out with Laundry Service. This is an AWESOME CD and Shakira has tons of talent. However, the reason I gave it a 3 was that she repeats some of the same songs she sings in English in Spanish...that is kinda annoying b/c it's 4 or 5 tracks less...overall it's an exceptional piece of work! Go Shakira!"
4,"Britney, Christina, et al, eat your hearts out...","This is a heck of a debut English CD for Spanish-language sensation Shakira. A sparkplug of a performer, Shakira has some electrifying tracks here. You've already heard ""Whenever, Wherever"" -- the most pop-sensitive single, also sung in Spanish. But there are lots of other little gems here, too.The first four songs alone are IMHO, sure-fire hits --1. Objection (Tango)2. Underneath Your Clothes3. Whenever, Wherever4. RulesShakira shows the most guts when she pokes fun at her small breasts, on more than one track. She isn't the world's best singer, but her voice is pleasant enough, and her spirit shines through.Enjoy!"
3,Too Ambitious For Her Own Good,"It's sometimes hard to categorize when listening to Shakira's English debut LAUNDRY SERVICE. It seems that she wants to be all things to all people--Celine('Underneath Your Clothes'), Alanis(too many to name), and your average dance diva--insert your choice here-('Ready For The Good Times'), while vocally sounding throughout as though she's channeling Jewel with slightly bigger lungs. Which makes for a more than slightly mixed bag of tunes. Granted, 'Whenever, Wherever' is easily the best thing to come from a Latino crossover artist since Ricky Martin's now-ubiquitous 'Livin La Vida Loca', and she brings the requisiste passion to tunes like the previously mentioned 'Underneath..' and '..Times'. But the schizo feel of it all might leave one's head spinning, and maybe not for the better. The talent is obviously here, but consistency is unfortunately not."
3,Shakira is NOT Alanis,"People compare Shakira to irreverent Alanis because they can't see an unique artist when they hear one. Shakira is one of a kind and her music and voice far surpass that of Alanis, the one-hit wonder.Her new album is fine work but it lacks the strength of her previous records. It is the result of producers, translators, and writers who know nothing of Latin music and love to pretend they do. Her voice is overwhelmed by too-strong beats and is unnecesarily computer-manipulated; her poetry translated to english, turned into merely, in her own words, ""the language of advertising"", and not the absolute truth it really is.For those that want to hear the real Shakira, check out Shakira Unplugged. You will not be dissapointed."
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM,"I don't care what language she speaks, Shakira is one of the most talented singer-songwriters in the world. Her album is much more refreshing that the new wave of POP that is filling the radio stations. It's unique and hip and she moves better than any female artist in the industry. My favorites are #8, #9, #3, and #1."
2,"Shakira, what did you do?","Shakira's first album (PIES DESCALZOS) was really great: feel with emotion, honest, genuine and without any fear of failure... which made it succesful. She now seems to have sold out to the most popular pop styles going on at the moment, forcing her voice excessively and manipulating her latin roots to attract the main commercial market: the USA. Her singing does not sound good in English and she sometimes appears to be a Jewel or an Alanis Morissette wannabe."
1,Yuck!!,"Yuck! this is the worst CD ever!Take my advice and don't waste your money on this garbage!They shouldn't even be classifying this as MUSIC!She's trying to be a singer? what a joke! Everyone knows thatin order to be a singer, you gotta be able to sing...and I mean really sing and have a real voice like Mariah Careyfor example! Shakira, sadly can't sing at all, and it's quitefunny to me that she is trying to. hahaha! This girl needs toleave the singing to the real singers who possess real talent!"
3,English Please,"I do like this album, i think all the songs are pretty good and they all have their own unique sound different to the others. But the one thing that annoys me about the album is that 4 of the 13 song are in spanish and not being a spanish speaker i'm really not going to sing along to those songs or listen to them regardless of how good the music is. Basically that means there are only 9 songs on the album to listen to really. I do recommend this album especially if you were a Shakira fan before ""WHENEVER,WHEREVER"", which is the best song on this album i think. Overall it's a good album which introduces the western world to Shakira's blend of pop/rock music."
2,huh?,Who let her write this drivel? She's about as comfortable singing in English as Christina Aguliera is singing in Spanish. Proof positive that a woman with a tight stomach and blonde hair can do anything.
2,Naturally Spanish is beautiful and English is ugly,Shakira was in over her head. She may have had such a tough time turning pretty Spanish into pretty English that this cd lacks the idomatic elements of language and sound that makes English Pop-Rock-soul music the most popular music in the world.Since English uses consonant clusters it is not posible to produce the beautiful sounds that a vowel based language like Spanish permits. Native English speakers and singers use the harsh grinding sounds of consonants to produce rude rock and crude pop. Sonic perfection is not the goal!Sakira will only get better once she understand that noise is what drives English popular music.
3,Sorry Shakira....,"Shakira's first two (well three if you count MTV Unplugged) albums were superb. I could find no faults what so ever with them and I'd totally recommend them. Sadly, ""Laundry Service"", Shakira's first English album, doesn't quite live up to her previous album's potentials.She's gone from being compared to Alanis Morrisette and other ""good"" singers to being compared with the likes of Britney Spears (now that is worrying).She clearly can't express herself properly in English and it ends up in a big pile of lame songs. Put a side the 4 Spanish songs and the two singles (""Whenever Wherever"" and ""Underneath Your Clothes""), there is nothing very interesting on this album.My advise to Shakira would be to dump the English (and the blonde hair!) and go back to her roots!ALBUM PRICE: 1/5- It won't play on your PCSONG QUALITY: 3/5- 6 Good songsALBUM LENGTH: 3/5- Average lengthTOTAL: 3/5"
3,How sad.,This album would have been fantastic had Shakira stuck to singing in Spanish. The result of her English album sounded forced and trite. She sounds like Britney Spears for crying out loud. The few Spanish songs on the album are the only things that make it worthwhile. Only a true diehard Shakira fan would forgive her for this. :(
2,I love Shakira...BUT.....,"I'll have to agree with Orlando29(reviewer)...this in fact is Shakira's worst album. It's great that she decided to cross over to English...but the music just isn't the same. The lyrics cannot be literally translated. The emotion and passion is completely GONE. The entire album sounds like any generic female artist (you have to admit, some artists are just a bite off other artists). Her voice doesn't sound as beautiful and unique in English as it does in Spanish. Even if you don't speak or understand Spanish, you'd be able to see the difference. The album cover isn't too original either. Guess I'll just have to wait for another Spanish album."
1,not so into this...,"ok i dont mean anything bad about shakira... i mean its just an opinion about her music im not here to criticize her or talk bad about her. but just like some1 before me said, its really true that her music sounds better in spanish... in all kinda ways... im not even into this kinda genre of music, but i just had to put my review here after seeing a video of hers now on tv (poem)... ive heard her album 'laundry service' too, and honestly it wasnt that nice (for me)......."
2,What a shame...,"Shakira has done the worst thing she could ever do. Sing in English! Throughout ""Laundry Service"", it's clear that Shakira doesn't have a clue what shes singing about, therefore it's pretty emotionless as well as totally boring. The best songs by far are both the English and Spanish versions of the hit ""Whenever Wherever"". All the other tracks are bland and of poor quality. Shakira's older albums (in Spanish) were incredible, such a shame she had to turn ""commercialised""."
1,Copy prevention damages computers,"This disc (it's not a true CD, according to Phillips) includes a copy prevention mechanism which may actually damage your PC, Mac, PS2, XBox, or standalone DVD player. Do not buy this disc if you want to play it on any of these devices."
2,laundry service (servicio de lavanderia),"primero antes que nada....I LOVE SHAKIRA......however this album is the worst i ever heard from someone so talented. shakira got lost in the air. shakira cambios los poemas por letra debiles & mediocres....the only good songs in the album are the one in spanish and the translation of ""ojos asi"" which is already a hit en espanol. this album is too pop......less rock and not a touch of power.......i was looking for songs with the caliber of ""inevitable, moscas en la casa & tu"" if you really want to listen shakira at her best....LISTEN TO ""DONDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES"" and will be able to hear the difference. despite of the fact, i still love shakira and the best of her is yet to come....of course ""en espanol"".......meanwhile i still listen to ""donde estan los ladrones""...until a real good album of shakira comes out."
5,A HILLARIOUS ALBUM BY SHAKIRA !,A superb compilation of songs in English performed by Shakira with her terrific voice under the supervision of Gloria Estefan.But the album is more rock infused rather than being latin and one can immediately realise that the use of least possible synth use as he harks it.Plus she wrote many pieces herself resulting in astoundingly good lyrics although she learned English not as her mother tongue.I bought ``Laundry Service'' on a pal's recommendation and now rue the time I missed as discovering such a great voice lately.Se has a very bright prospect of success should she keeps up the good work!
4,Shake it Shakira,"She is hot and this cd proves it....with her ability to pour out her soul in English and Spanish, backed by some good beats, these tracks are worth getting into...."
3,her 15 minutes are NOW,"Based on the usual reactionary word of mouth when an artist attempts a major pop crossover, I though I'd hate this. After one listen, I actually DID hate it. Fortunately, I suspected that my aversion was due to being exposed to something totally unexpected, so I kept listening. Final verdict: This is glitzy and crass but also surprisingly well-crafted both lyrically and musically. (I hear echoes of everyone from Lene Lovich and Cher to the B-52s.)The clincher, though, is Shakira's voice, which floats like a butterfly from octave to octave, and her winsomely flat enunciation of English vowels and consonants. Though she dresses like Charo's illegitimate niece, her lyrics are heartfelt, humble, even tough-minded--teenage girls can, and will, find much worse to model themselves after. Get it while you can...Predicted next career move: Vegas--or Hollywood, wherever the plane lands first."
2,Que paso?,"What happened to Shakira? The reason why so many of us enjoyed her music was because of her originality in Spanish (despite the Alanis-isms). Pies descalsos and Ladones were great and she looked great. Laundry service is a disappointment and I suppose a compromise to launch into the main stream (too bad for us). Just to sum it up, my 15-year old stepson loves the album and doesn't understand a word of Spanish - it just gets lumped in with Britney and all the other whatevers! Esperando el proximo! Haydee"
3,She should stick to spanish,The spanish songs as usual were brilliant. I am not sure about the ones in english. I regret it buying it since most of the songs are in english......and not very good
5,THE LATINS ATTACK!!!,"Well, I love Shakira's voice, her music and her lyrics. I think this new CD is gonna be a success, I like too much her first single ""Wherever, whenever"" maybe she's gonna fill the hole that Alanis Morrisette left behind....I hope you enjoy it as me, and if you listen careful, you'll find a big influence (or copy?) of Bangels ""Eternal Flame"" in her song ""Underneath your clothes"". Thanx."
1,WHY???,"Con este album shakira se volvió más comercial. Esto es triste, por que su música era lo único rescatable de la porquería que inunda la música latina. Los Estefan defecaron sobre este album.El comercialismo mata la creatividad, aquí es donde le digo ""descanse en paz"". La única rola rescatable de esto es Suerte.English translation:With this album shakira went more commercial. This is sad, because her music was the only that could be rescued from the filth that fills latin music. The Estefans made a mess of this album. I think commerciality kills creativity, and here is when I say ""rest in peace"". The only good song in here is Suerte."
1,Won't play on PC or Mac,Be warned. If you want to play this CD on a PC or a Macintosh. It won't work. This CD has been copy protected. It might also not play in some DVD Players and car CD players.
2,I couldn't understand a word,"I am a hardcore Shakira fan, she is the greatest singer ever,but I was so very dissapointed when she sang ""Whatever/Whenever on TRL, I could not understand a word that woman sang, it was so sad, because she sounds really good on the album and yet live it was a nigthmare.I am sorry to all my Shakira fans BUT lets face it LIVE is what really counts. So lets hope she does great , and keep praying that THALIA does NOT sing in english AGAIN) hehehe. and hope there s anoher spanish album ahead. :<"
2,This is not the Shakira we know,"To market herself to an American audience, Shakira has sacrificed a lot of things. I don't see the merit of selling to the Anglo world if you're going to wear such a mask and in the process deteriorate your music to the point of not being recognizable. With the artist she was before, she already had more than enough. Shakira's real gift can be heard in Pies Descalzos and ¿Dónde están los ladrones? ""Suerte"" is the only good tune in this album. This album freezes her natural gift and turns it into pre-fabricated radio material. I hope Shakira goes back to making music soon. Also, what's with the look? Her black hair was so beautiful as was her simpler way of dressing. I guess she is aiming at an American audience that can't look past the flesh."
2,"Lovely lady, lovely music, but much much better in spanish","Although Shakira's english is perfect, the music loses somethingin english (like watching a foreign-language DVD with a english voice-overs). I'd go for her earlier albums, songs like ""ojos asi"" in english don't cut it. Her earlier albums are highly recommended."
4,"Cool, my favorite singer, what about you?","Hey, this is my favorite singer. She has everything, the look, and lovely face, the sexy body and a beautiful voice. It amazed me that she was not born in the U.S. I listen to her CD almost every day.A good buy. I gave 4 stars because 3 songs were in Spanish which I have absolutely no knowledge of."
2,"Don't give up, oh ye of shakey hips!","I give this cd two stars because there are only two tracks of merit. Underneath Your Clothes and Whenever, Wherever are fresh, funky and fun. The rest of the cd is a total sucky letdown. However, those two tracks are very different, which means there's hope for Shakira that she may yet have a few surprises in store for fans. That is an as yet unproven mathematic probability, but a probability none the less. Besides, with Gloria Estefan holding your hand, how can you fail?"
3,dry cleaning!,shakira's music on this cd is not as powerful and emotional as her previous works. i found some of the songs on this cd to be a lacking of the voice i enjoy so much. her voice is one of a kind and i find that i loose my self in it in her music. but not so much in this cd.
2,Disappointing,"Shakira's English debut is rather disappointing. I love her Spanish albums, but this one is definitely missing the qualities that made me a real fan of her music. Her incredible voice is really restrained on this album (with a couple of exceptions.) Shakira is at her best when her voice is the central focus, not a bunch of overproduced noise. Also, her lyrics are poor at best and made be actually laugh a couple of times. I realize that English is not her native language, but come on - she needs to do a little better. I am not even going to start on the blonde look. Let me just say that I really miss the Shakira from ""Donde estan los ladrones?"" I haven't given up on her by any means, but I really hope that her next album sounds a lot more like her previous work."
3,Un Prisionero del Pasado,"As many other Latin artists eager to gain new fans in new territories, Shakira has produced her first album of (mostly) English songs, which (unfortunately) for someone already accustomed to hearing her in Spanish sound...different.Somehow her melancholic lyrics and defiant voice I got used to (love!) in her Spanish songs become less convincing and beautiful. But I do understand the enourmous potential of English speaking markets so I'm expecting Laundry Service to do fairly well against Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and the like minded. I hope she'll continue writing songs in Spanish since that's where you discover the uniqueness of her music. ""Que me Quedes Tu"" and ""Suerte"" are well written and composed songs...I like them a lot. I give Laundry Service 3 stars as value for money."
2,CROSSOVER DIASTER,"SHAKIRA is quite simply an explosive performer.Her beautifullooks,earthy vocals,and sensual dancing present both exoticand tropical possibilties,which comes to the likening to thefan.Too bad,Shakira's first English album,""Laundry Service"" hasto be so watered down.The first single,""Whenever Wherever""(co-written by Gloria Estefan) is second-rate Shakira.It's faux-Middle eastern vibeand Shakira's incoherent yodeling may have limited ""TRL"" fanshappy but real fans of Shakira's true work know better.The rest of ""Laundry Service"" is pretty much crossover hell.Full of cheesy filler and worthless ballads.It's sad to seesuch a first rate Latin-speaking artist like Shakira singsuch bad material but it just goes to show you that 'crossover'success doesn't always mean quality music."
3,She was better singing in spanish,"When Shakira appeared on the musical scene with her album ""Pies descalzos"" I bacame a big fan of her. Her lyrics and music were amazing. Donde están los ladrones was another supreme cd. So I expected an excellent English work. Now, that I've listened Laundry Service I'm really dissapointed. Where is the old Shakira? I think she've really sacrified her essence to be a smash hit in the States. Also I used to love her personality, so naive. Now she wants to be and look like a sex symbol, an unbeliavable mix of Alanis, Britney and Madonna..."
5,No Alanis here,"Shakira's style is very unique, passionate, and gets you moving. Please stop referring to her as an Alanis clone - she has been around a LOT longer than Alanis Morisette. She's an original."
5,Fantastic Album!!!,"Shakira is my favourite singer. She is so cool. My favourite song on this album is Objection, which is a song about being put down by a man with a Tango twist. I also like Underneath Your Clothes, a slow moving love song, and Whenever Wherever, a fast paced dance track. My favourite album at the moment!"
2,A mixed bag,"I was expecting something really great and original after hearing the hype about Shakira. She is a middling singer at best and has only one good song on this album. Most of the songs are simple retreads of better music. She should have spent more time in the studio and with a singing coach. But the album has good production values and good studio musicians. Too bad the material is so weak. This album will be forgotten in 5-7 years but ""Whenever, Wherever"" will probably be played on the radio for many, many years to come."

1,What a waste,"Often, it seems that artist work hard to create one hit song, then after doing so, they blow off the rest of the album seemingly coming up with and recording the rest of the songs over night; Shakira is no different. She obviusly knew that ""Whatever Whenever"" would be such a hit song that it would cause her fans to buy the entire album."
2,Could have been better,"I bought `Donde Estan Las Ladrones?` on a whim a few months ago and was struck by the power of this Columbian chanteuse's voice. I never took Spanish in high school, but this CD made me want to sign up immediately for classes. I waited anxiously for the release of `Laundry Service`, to hear what her amazing voice would sound like. Unfortunately, Shakira's voice is nowhere to be found on her English language debut. The only times you get a real sense of her gifts as a singer are on the four Spanish language tracks (particularly `Suerte`, the Spanish version of `Whenever, Wherever`). I was especially disappointed with the English `Ojos Asi` - the words did not flow as well into the Arabic stanzas. Overall, the production quality is pretty weak. You can barely hear her voice at times over the percussion and bass beats. A real shame. Let's hope any subsequent English releases are better, because Shakira deserves much better than this effort."
3,if you like madonna you'll like this,whenever wherever sounds like a throwback to la isla bonita and the girl can really move and tries different styles of world music and pop music on this record.
3,Laundry Service,"I like Shakira and all but i was VERY disappointed by this cd. Half of the songs are in Spanish, wasn't this supposed to be a cross-over cd? i feel like i wasted my money listening to songs i can't understand. There are a couple of quality songs on here: Fool, Underneath Your Clothes, Eyes Like Yours."
4,An often underrated charmer and writer,"Shakira sings and writes her heart out and gives so much too her hybrid latin-rock-pop music that its easy to see how well she can be celebrated by those that appreciate her innocent yet disciplined approach to rock and dance music. Shakira puts real energy into her music and stands away from the likes of those she is compared too most often (Paulina Rubio, Thalia) and much rather sounds like ""Avril Lavigne"" then her same compared latin pop artists for the more ""rock"" music she writes.Both catchy and danceable songs make up this album and as her previous 2 stuido efforts doesn't lack in diversity as well as ballads and an almost ""house"" sounding song ""ready for the good times""Shakira is a bright and entertaining artist. I look forward to more developed and matured music from her."
4,Here to stay (woman full of grace),This album is the worst made by Shakira. It is great but the past ones were better. I particularly recommend you to download this songs of her first albums:- Inevitable- Ciega sordomuda- Estoy aquí (unplugged)- Pies descalzos- Tu- No creo- Moscas en la casa- Ojos así (unplugged)Those are the greatest songs from Shakira's previous works.Please tell me if you liked those songs: ...
4,Why is this CD called laundry service anyway?,"ok, so she's naked in the photo, so does that mean ALL her clothes are at the laundry service? she can't keep any clothes behind? now how often does this happen? what if she has a concert that night? and is that tatoo real? why not the ""actual"" name of the laundry service? with maybe a phone number and locations? THAT would be a REAL tribute to a laundry service! as of now, the tatoo is mearly a show of solidarity with all laundry services in general. but why laundry services? I can find no lyrics about clean clothes ANYWHERE on the CD! because of that I am docking the CD one star!"
5,Absolutely GREAT!,"Shakira's Laundry Service is absolutely amazing! Excellent! Her first English album has a perfect blend of Latin Rhytms, Rock and also some Eastern inlfuences also. All of the songs are excellent, especially Tango, Rules, Whenever Wherever, Fool... If you'like any of Shakira's older material, then this is a MUST for you, and I also recommend it to everyone who likes just a little of this type of music!"
2,"AGHH!! why, Shakira, WHY?","I think she screw herself with this album. she was GREAT singing in spanish. Now, she made the stupid crossover. She didn't need to do that! And the english version of Ojos así (Eyes like yours) it's horrible. it loses every sense in the song. (...)"
1,Hope she gets millions for selling Pepsi -she'll need it,5 stars for her ability to shake her can.5 stars for being a hottie.1 star for her highly irritating voice and her calculated commercialism.
2,¿Dónde está Shakira?,"¿Qué se hizo Shakira?Estas canciones no son tan buenas. Algo le falta a la música, a las letras. ¿Dónde está Shakira? ¿Dónde está su música? Puede hacerse la gran estrella ahora cantando en inglish, pero la han cambiado o se ha cambiado. Estos no son los días de antaño, cuando Shakira cantaba con una energía que te llegaba al centro del corazón, los días de ¿Dónde estás corazón? o Ciega sordomuda.Que regrese la cantante.Su voz es más bella, más fuerte y más sincera en castellano. Y el sonido de su musica es mejor cuando no la controlan los verdes.¿Dónde está la música?Si me pongo de desnudota tocándome el busto o doy entrevistas hablando de que si soy virgen o no me compran el disco hoy en día. Vaya payasada.Lo que quiero es música. Los videos no sirven para nada. ¿Que se ha hecho la gente tan estúpuida que ya ni puede imaginarse una canción por sí sola?"
1,"Commercial music, that is all.","This CD presents only commercial music. Do not look for something else. If you want to get bored, buy it.If you like Shakira, watch her videos. But you are wasting your time if you look for good music.Her accent in English is bad (part of the lyrics can not be understood).What she calls Tango, it is an offense to the Argentinian music style. If that is a tango, Piazzolla and Gardel were devoted to Colombian music..."
5,ole!,"Don't know about you but I like the spanish version of her big hit, whereever, whenever better-this CD is a must buy for ""Siempre"" and ""Objection-Tango"", ""Poem to a Horse"" is a cool song as well. Shakira is HOT, her videos (especially those on MTV-S) are the bomb!"
4,Great album,"My first thought is ""Wow"". Along comes another skinny blond singer and I am thinking, so what? Turns out this is a great album. Shakira is so very talented. ""Underneath Your Clothes"" is so far up in my head that I find myself singing it constantly. I think this is just #1 in a long line of English albums by Shakira that will go very far."
5,Shakira is hot!,"Shakira is hot! Her music is great, her voice is unique, her moves and dancing are incredible and she is so beautiful it is crazy."
5,Shakira's Best,"In my opinion, this is Shakira's best cd to date!!..in fact, this is my second purchase of this cd..I wore the last one out from playing it so much."
3,Shakira Laundry Service,I purchased this album after hearing her at the inauguration ball. Ihad not heard any tracks before and although I enjoyed the album wasdisappointed that her singing didn't show the power she has currently.Will try some of her more recent albums
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I had heard of Shakira many times living in the Los Angeles area. How could I not, right? I had seen her face on the MTV Movie awards and on many signs around this fine city. However when I bought a cd or two I liked what I heard in Spanish.I feel bad for her, believing what someone told her about changing everything in order to make it in the American market. It's more sad that she gave up her roots in order to appeal to the masses.My admission: I bought this cd only for the Suerte, the Spanish version of Whenever, Wherever which is by far a more beautiful song in Spanish. And my cd player play the MTV Unplugged instead."
4,Shakira rocks!!,"I have not been a Shakira fan for very long, but the first time I heard ""Whenever, Wherever"" on the car radio I almost drove off the road. I have never heard anything like it. The instant I heard it I knew I had to get this CD. There is such passion and animation in her music! The fast songs in particular are excellent. I have listened to all of them and they are quite good as well. (...)"
3,Good English Debut,"Some previous reviewer mentionned Celine Dion, and this album is reminiscent of Celine's first attempt in English as well. Having proven herself remarkably in her native Spanish, this is a pretty solid English debut album from a world class songstress and artist. Nice mix of ballads, pop and rythmic rock, as one should now come to expect from Shakira. However, when one compares her latin songs to the English versions, the translations seem to lose a little bit of their soul, of that latin edge and charisma that makes them so wonderful. You can feel where she is most at ease, where the emotions come out naturally and where she seems to hesitate. This being said, I still remain a big fan and you can make up your own mind by comparing ""Laundry"" to ""Ladrones""."
2,I just got this,"I just picked up this cd and have heard her music before in Spanish. It's much better that way and seems to flow easier than in this album. If you haven't heard her music before, I would not recommend this cd. If you like Shakira, though, and want to pick up something worth listening to from her. Get ""Donde estan los Ladrones.""This cd does have one song I liked on the disk ... in Spanish (Suerte). The English counterpart wasn't as pleasing. Overall, if you like her in Spanish, don't get this unless you just want to hear a few good songs."
5,There you go Shakira!,"Amazing cd, I went to lots of stores trying to buy it and it was sold out, so your best bet is amazon.com. I am amazed by her lyrics and her style, no other latin singer can write, dance and perform like Shakira. I really like ""Whenever, Wherever"", ""Ready For The Good Times"" and ""Que Me Quedes Tu"". The entire cd is worth it. You go girl!"
5,Shakira is unique!,"Shakira's new album is wonderful. First of all, she has a beautiful and amazing voice. Second: she is a excellent writter and the most important thing: She fells music. If you want a good album buy her new one: Laundry Service!"
1,Known to crash your Mac...,"...and no, it's not that Macs have specifically attuned musical tastes that make them crash because of the music, per se. However, this CD (among others) has a form of copy protection which (a) make this disc NOT a CD, technically or legally, and (b) will prevent you from listening to this disc in your portable digital music player (on either Mac or PC computers). Search on the Apple support site for tech doc #106882 for additional details."
1,Please stick to the bumpin salsa music,"This gal should not do ballads. Her voice could shatter glass. Sorry, but Underneath Your Clothes (which in itself is a lame title) is terrible."
5,Great CD,One of the best CD's I've purchased since buying CDs!!!!! Can't miss with this one - something for everyone.
1,Shakira in Spanish is A LOT better,"OK first off I really like all her Spanish stuff and was really excited when I heard she was making a CD in English. I loved the first single and was eager to buy it-- but then I heard it.In lots of the songs she doesn't seem to show emotion like any other singer would. I'm not critizing her, but I'm not too sure if she exactly understands what she's saying. She sings at the same speed as if the songs were in Spanish which has shorter words and is easy to speak fast and understand. (I've been taking Spanish for 5 years now). What I mean by ""no emotion"" is that if you don't know what you're singing it's hard to sing it like you do and not sound [bad].So if you like the sound and don't mind if it's in another language (even though on this album it's hard to tell it's English) get ?Donde Estan Los Londrados? It's the best Spanish album out there."
1,Not as good as I thought it would be,If you like Shakira's spanish albums (a lot) be prepared for a big change. I love her spanish work so I bought this with out even listening to it. Mistake... and I can't return it because I opened it. I suggest listening to it before you buy it.
3,Not that bad...,"While this CD isn't half-bad, I still believe that Shakira just sounds better in Spanish. This isn't a diss on her English skills but I believe that singers just sound better in their native language. I would recommend to pick up one of her CDs with songs in Spanish (or even her album that has her Greatest Hits in Spanish) instead of this CD."
4,Shakira,"Decent cd. Other than her main hits there are really only 1 or 2 other songs that may be popular. The cd has a rock edge, but is still a little poppy, however this cd is very different than anything I have ever heard. I like it, but I am sure it is not her best work."
3,True to Form,"I'm pleased that Shakira didn't change her style for this album. She rocks in true Shakira form. Every other Latin artist I am aware of generally abandons Latin musical stylings when singing for a crossover audience, which negates my purpose for listening. However, I wouldn't give Shakira total credit for making an English crossover album since approximately 1/3 of the album is sung in Spanish. Why? English-language singers generally don't include ANY Spanish songs on their albums. (Nor, to my knowledge, do they dye their hair black.) However, my biggest complaint about this album is that Shakira's attractive voice is buried in the mix, especially on the English songs. I can't understand very much at all of what she is singing about. What a shame. What is the purpose of making a crossover album if you feel the need to downplay the distinction. Hopefully, her voice will ring loud and clear the next time around."
3,pop she is not,"Ok, so i admit that laundry service is not Shakira's best album. i like it ok but in comparison to the standard she set with Donde estan los ladrones in '98, this latest album definitaly falls short. However, i want to set one thing straight. Shakira is NOT POP! pop princesses JLo and Britney have never even touched an instrument, let alone written their own lyrics. Shakira might not always triumph in the music world, but she is ALWAYS an original. so go ahead and buy this disk if you want-Objection, Poem to a Horse, Eyes Like Yours, and Fool are all good songs. But if you want the best of a truly great artist, buy Donde estan los Ladrones."
4,Shakira is the real deal!,"Many latin singing stars come along in music these days but there is only one that I feel is great, and that is shakira! Shehas worked hard for many years to get where she is at and her album laundary service is a great album. Whenever wherever, tango(objection) and underneath your clothes were all hits on the radio but there is a few other good songs on this album too.It's the perfect album to put on when in a good mood or feel like dancing! I would recommend it to anyone that is consideringbuying it."
4,The colombian sensation SHAKIRA,"I think that this cd is very very great...in my country ECUADOR shakira is a famous singer since 1995, her fist single debut in Latinoamérica was ""Donde estás corazón"" from the albun ""Pies descalzos"", it was #1 in Ecuador, after she backed in 1998 with ""Ciega, sordomuda"",""Inevitable"" and the best song of this album ""Ojos así""......the new album of the colombian sensation is nice...the best of shakira is that writes and produces the lyrics and music of all the album and that's is important....but I think that can pronunce better her english with the next album....The best song of this album is ""Suerte/Whenever wherever"" because in this song she introduces the Andes's rhythm and she doesn't forget her culture....is for all that that it song was #1 in all Europe, Latin américa, Australia, and Asia.....Great CD...."
2,Is this more then a single,"There are two good songs on this. The two popular ones of course. The rest i did not like at all. If you're only looking for those two get the CD. If you're looking for that and more dont bother. I know she can do better, but she decided to only do two good songs and the rest aren't worth the skimpy shirts she wears."
3,"Laughable lyrics, but it's got a good beat......","As a lyricist, Ms. Shakira makes a great pop singer.....but the production is well done and the tracks are memorable. This cd will probaly collect dust on my shelf after I grow tired of it, but for right now....it's not a bad time passer. Not a classic, but perhaps the first in many English language hit cds for Shakira."
2,Selling out to American listeners.,"Comparing this album to, say, Shakira's MTV Unplugged is like comparing The Beatles to the The Monkees. Laundry Sevice is a pitiful excuse of music from someone who was showing such huge potential and promise of a real singer/songwriter. I would never have believed that we would witness Shakira marketed on her blond hair and belly button rather than her talent. Oh well, my kids will sing her songs with the likes of the boy bands and the countless other talentless pop stars of commercialmania now. Too bad really. Her other CD's were great. Thanks Gloria & Emilio for nothing."
5,This is a masterpeice!!!!!,"this cd is fantastic.This cd really shows of shakiras vocals,and her songwriting.On the track ""underneath your clothes "" shakira writes about how much she loves someone and describes them as "" a song written by the hands of god"".If you see this cd in a store this is a must-have .Whenever, wherever makes you want to get up and dance!!! it made me dance, for sure .The lyrics make so much sense to me, unlike some other music today.To sum up in two words : GET IT!!!!!!"
4,Good but not Great,"I am a huge Shakira fan, and really love quite a few songs on this album. Great first english album, great spanish songs. I just feel like she can't express her beautiful voice as well in english as she can in spanish. The lyrics in spanish are more soulful than their english counterparts. I still highly recommend this album, but would recommend Pies Descalsos to those new to Shakira. Those songs will definetly get you hooked even if you don't understand the words."
5,"I'll Play this CD ""Whenever Wherever!""","This CD is a must buy! I have been a fan of Shakira since her previous album, ""Donde Estan Los Ladrones,"" this CD is a must have for all people who love good music. She is not the next Madonna or Britney Spears, she is original. Her Columbian accent is strong but beautiful in most songs, and the rhythm is very moving. Such songs as ""Te Dejo Madrid,"" and ""Eyes Like Yours"" (which is a remake of 'Ojos Asi' from her last album) makes the CD worth buying as does ""Whenever Wherever"" her first english single. I have this Cd in my car, and it is a great album for on the road."
4,Shakira's amazing,"Ok, so the album lacks the direction it needs to establish a firm audience, but when every song is THIS GOOD, anyone who appriciates good, solid music should buy this cd. I don't know if a better song has been released than ""Whenever, Wherever"" last year. Other standouts include the rock numbers ""Fool"", and ""Te Dejo Madrid"", One of the nicest love songs I've heard in a while is ""The One"", and for a fun, latin meets rock number, check out Objection (Tango). Shakira's vocals and amazing songwriting skills are the only constant elements of the disc. It's quite the mish mash of sound, but even if you find it confusing, every song is strong, and worth a listen."
3,A bit disapointed but still worth it,"Yes I was a bit disapointed when i listened to her new cd. Maybe I was expecting too much of it. The truth is I did not find the Shakira I used to know, except for her spanish songs. I think she lost her originality and what used to make her so special and unique (starting with the fact that she bleached her hair).Her songs are good, but they sound old. What I mean is that I could recognize old songs that used to play on the radio some years ago. One reviewer already said that one song sounds like one of the Bangles and I totally agree with her. The first one reminded me a lot of Ricky Martin too.I still recomend you to buy this CD, but please if you really want to know this incredible artist and see what she is capable of, go buy her previous albums. Especially ""Donde estan los ladrones"" and the MTV unplugged."
4,More than just laundry service...,"This is my first Shakira album, but when I heard ""Suerte"" on Galavision, I wanted her new album so finally I bought it last night and I have listened to it at least 10 times already. Shakira is definitely unique. Her style is a cross between Alanis Morisette, some latino, and country and occasional dance. Tracks like ""Underneath Your Clothes"", ""Wherever, Whenever"", ""The One"", and ""Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)"" are the highlights of her album. Some of the others are a little repetitive but these are the hits of the album. I am disappointed that I don't hear her on the radio much because I know a lot more people would like her if they got the chance to hear her. So I recommend this to anyone who qualifies for the Shakira style."
5,amazing,(...) i think this cd is amazing and i'd highly recommend it. the sounds are new and refreshing compared to the other trash that is currently on the radio. it's encouraging to know that there are still true artists out there who can write their own lyrics and music.
2,Shakira is OK..............,"I'm not a Shakira fan, but I feel that her cross over album is ok. The only thing that bothers me a bit is her not so clear lyrics. Her songs don't make any sense what so ever. I heard that she writes her songs in a form of a poem and they supposed to have a hidden message, but I feel since english is her second language, she doesn't make so much sense. Her lyrics in english lose whatever meaning they have. I don't think Shakira has a longivity in her cross over to the english market, I feel that she would make another english album but it will be poor in sales. People will forget Shakira, she's all about ... shaking."
2,No Pepper In This Salsa,"We waited so long for a new CD from Shakira to come out and we get this uninspired collection. If this were Mexican food I'd send it back and get some Thai! My expectation was a powerful, breakthrough CD. Instead it's a string of so-so songs that don't seem to have any real drive. Who knows, the American public will probably love it. I heard her in an interview where she said that when she had dark hair people compared her with Alanis and now that she has blonde hair people compare her with Britany. Maybe she should shaveher head and be the (...) singer songwriter that we have all come to love."
2,Colombian Alanis,"If you like Alanis you will definitely like Shakira (Shakira was doing this way before Alanis came out).If you dislike Shakira's little shrieks and choral vowel prolongations then stay away. Sometimes she just loses the tone and is only rescued by the dance beats backing her vocals. Give her some points for the few rap verses - some originality involved.Take away Shakira's voice, and you have some great beats, good melody and great dancing material.Hopefully, she may get continue with songs like Ojos Asi (English version in this album). She is best when original and when not pretending she has the vocal quality of a Cristina Aguilera."
2,could it have been any worst? She should stick to spanish,"This cd has been in it's case sincethe day i bought it. And it'shorrible for me to say this but it's not my favorite. I have gone from admiring her talents and music to just not being sure of what to think. I think i was serioudly one of hr biggest fans when she released her cd pies descalzos to dondeestan los ladrones. Sh is a true inpiration. The writes and produces her own songs. But she shouldn't do it in english. I think the only good song on the cd is the last song, which is in spanish. Her voice in english needs practice. I am just speaking what i think. She will always be my favorite singer. But to me this new path she's taking is just not the right one. I'm sorry if i offened fans or even shakira. I will continue to listen to her spanish cds forever."
1,torture,"i found maybe one borderline decent song.Yeah, it would be a borderline decent song if sung by someone else...It is so unpleasant, and lacks range,power, and intensity...And I don't care if Shakira writes her own music.It's not like it's good music.All the songs sound exactly the same and there is no variety.The production sounds cheap, and everything sounds terribly rushed.I don't know how anyone can like her music or that voice!!"
1,Grossly inferior to Donde Estan los Ladrones,"The English songs on this CD are just plain mediocre compared to the brilliant, original and exciting Spanish songs on Donde Estan los Ladrones. Shakira ""succeeds"" (if you want to call it that) in making herself sound like just another American female pop singer, and her lyrics in English are decidedly on the mundane side. The wonderful voice heard on Ladrones is here buried by the raucous instrumentation. If you loved the full, rich Latin sound of Ladrones, then you are in for a severe disappointment here."
2,Wrong Language,"Normally, this CD would deserve 3 stars, except it is based on Shakira's last Spanish language CD, which is worth 5 stars. Buy it, ""Donde Estan Los Ladrones?"", instead."
4,Good Belly Dance Music,"I'm a belly dance student and my aunt is a belly dance teacher of 30 years experience and she states that this CD is an awesome belly dance CD for beginners. Donde estan los ladrones is an awesome CD also, but if you're looking for some good stuff, you've gotta buy this CD, no questions asked."
5,New fan of Shakira,"I don't know who is Shakira last week.I buy this CD this week.I really love this music, it's incredible.I go to the music store for buy the other CDs of Shakira.beautiful song....i recommand this CD"
3,Not great in English,"I love Shakira,but her music sounds much better in spanish.This CD wasn't doing much for her voice and the songs aren't that great either,especially Eyes like yours(Ojos Asi).This song sounds much,much better in spanish.I would recommend you buy one of her spanish albums than this CD."
2,not the rock-n-roll Shakira that we know and love...........,"DONDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES is one of my all-time favorite albums; great songs you can sing and dance to, you don't need to speak spanish to enjoy, great guitar riffs and gritty vocals.Here, her first english album (which I waited a LONG time for) was one hell of a disappointment.Here she has taken on a totally new persona; she is no longer rock, she is pop. Instead of great rock you can dance to she is doing an Latin inpersontion of Brittney Spears (okay, she pulls it off quite well, but what about us? her fans who hate Brittney and the sex-kitten pop that has saturated the entire music scene and just like rock?) and left the guitars and the gritty lyrics behind.Quite frankly, I was hoping for more songs like ""Ciega, Sordomuda"" and ""Inventible"", songs of passion and longing, disappointment and rock; songs you can turn all the way up in your car and scream at the top of your lungs! Didn't happen this time, maybe next time."
3,Don't waste your money.,"First off, I am a big fan of pop and latin music as well. However, this album did not meet the expectations I had for it. I bought it as soon as it came out because I loved her first single ""Whenever, wherever"", but there were only two other songs on here worth listening to. The girl can sing but the songs on this album did not represent that at all. Better luck next time."
3,all right,"I only liked one song on this cd and that was #3 Whenever, Wherever. A lot of the songs are in spanish and I didn't like the other songs that she sang in English. Just buy the single for Whenever, Wherever. I found an import at Amazon.com its ASIN is B00005V8Z1 so just copy and paste it on the search box and it'll bring up the single."
1,What the heck happened to her!,Before she was just a normal talented dedicated musician . ...P>I am sorry but Shaki needs to get a life and ... the only thing left for me to say is THIS CD IS GARBAGE AND IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE SONG ...BR>DON'T BUY IT!
1,"Shakira, get your clothes and leave!","I am not saying anything but... ""Shakira, get thee to the laundry and wash, not only your clothes, but your act."" Your other two albums were smash hits, but this one is your biggest flaw. Whoever would sing to a horse? Get a life, Shakira!"
1,IF I COULD ONLY UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE SINGS??,Her English is really bad. I dont know why she did a crossover. All she is known for is for her BELLY DANCE MOVES. THE REST IS DULL STUFF. Her voice is AWFUL. She does not put feeling into the songs. NO WONDER SHE FAILED WITH THIS ALBUM. DONT BUY THIS. IT IS NOT WORTH IT.
1,Another Poor Latin Product,"Listening to this album will take you to the land of constant repetition, with only 3 minutes per song as a proof of how mainstream can Shakira be only to acomplish the music label and regular fans.Colombia's poorest pseudrock star comes again with a simple cd full of musical inconsistencies such this 13 tracks, most of all in english (9), in a way to overcome her personal style and to explore the american market. Of course she coudn't make neither.Shakira's Laundry Service is completely a Brainwash Service, the entire album is like a child book to learn how to read, with mediocre lyrics only to prove her lack of inspiration. Only the good job of Ted Jensen's Sterling Sound in New York could save, in sound, the bad music."
1,ewww...,"Ewww... she has the worst voice ever!I nearly almost hurled after hearing her song ""whenever, where ever."" One day I was in a clothing store and they had ""whenever, where ever"" playing in the store, and I immediately rushed out of store because I could not stand Shakira's voice. So I went outside to get some fresh air. and I puked a little bit in a bush outside. Oh thank God I got out of there before I would've thrown up all over the floor while in the store listening to Shakira.Just remembering that day makes me wanna puke all over again."
5,-,"Though many people say that her voice sounds better in Spanish than English, I think she sounds almost Irish in her song, 'Whenever, Wherever.' It has that shaky sense to it, similar to Clannad."
3,She just misses the point,"Shakira's songs are pretty catchy and have good sounds, but i have to say her song writing is pretty [weak]. ""to buy more thongs, to write more happy songs"" it doesn't get much more [weak] than that. But pretty good for her first cross-over album"
5,Laundry Duty,"Debuting on the mainstream pop scene with the disjointed pop gem ""Whenever, Wherever"". The song's proclaimations of small and humble breasts and agile legs became a radio staple. It's definitely the most standout of the album, but there are plenty of other great tracks contained within, including the emotional ""Underneath Your Clothes"" and the supremely catchy ""Objection (Tango)"", both singles that have also been released. She makes an amusing lyricist, and her voice is definitely left of center, making her all the more interesting in the pop world. Great tracks like ""Poem To A Horse"" and ""Eyes Like Yours"" could easily follow the past singles to the upper reaches of chart sucess. Definitely a good English language debut for the small and humble one."
2,This book is way overpriced,"I can't believe the nerve of the publisher charging what they do for material written by grad students. To add insult to injury, they didn't even bother re-setting the typography or images. Tables are disconnected from the text and the graphics are horrible.I had to buy this book for an entrepreneurship class. Do not buy this book as a reference for Finance or Entrepreneurship. It is a bound collection of student papers. The graphics are horrible, usually badly enlarged clip art or newspaper-quality pictures. It is very difficult to find any information in the book (like relevant cases) because there is no index and the table of contents is after 12 pages of advertisment and boasting by the ""author"".If your professor requires this book, well, I'm sorry. If you're looking for a reference book, you'd be better off picking one at random."
3,"Pretty sketchy, and the descriptions aren't all that accurat","I picked this up as an avid central illinois day hiker. I'd done probably a dozen of the hikes listed, and was amazed to see just how different an impression that the author had had compared to mine. I found many descriptions just simply inaccurate or misleading, and laughed out loud at some of the trails that she had marked as 4-5 boot's difficult (I found them to be very easy trails, and I'm not some superman).The book consists of several sets of maps, the 'how to get there' maps are pretty good, but the trail maps are practically worthless. Don't rely on them to find your way around.Several of the 'hikes' are very urbanized, including walking through cities. Not my idea of a hike, but I guess they count. All in all, I was moderately disapointed in this book. The plusses are there are some good ideas for hikes listed that you might not have found all in one spot, but the usefulness pretty much ends at getting you to the park."
3,Cute,Outfit is cute but the fuzzy stuff around the collar comes off a little bit in the beginning when you first get it. My daughter has had it on her stuffed animal for awhile now and I don't see it coming off much anymore.
3,Truly Underwhelming,"This volume of Powers has three different stories going on. First is the death of Olympia, a famed superhero found dead mysteriously in a ratty apartment. Next is a one-shot issue featuring the acclaimed writer Warren Ellis as himself in ride-along with Detective Walker. Last, there's a story about a washed up superhero called the Shark caught in a binding circumstance.Overall, it's pretty disappointing in the sense that none of the stories amounts to anything particularly compelling or climactic. The story with Olympia is unsatisfying and the mystery of how and why he died isn't really answered. The Warren Ellis issue is interesting enough, but ends with an all-too-convenient cliff hanger that's a little frustrating. The last plot with the Shark ends up being the most enjoyable, as it features a short-and-sweet story with nice source material at the end."
5,Conceivably the best electronic listening album ever release,"The Black Dog seems to catch on a variety of feelings, some more powerful than the average Joe could understand. Extremely majestic, disturbing and soothing at the same time, and down right beautiful! Bytes, Spanners, and the rest of the music they've writen is some of the best we could choose to hear"
5,fnaar fnaar.,"heh, the first review of this is dated to 1999.only 7 years after it came out........if you weren't in UK between 92-94, listening to electronica, im truly sorry. you missed some absolute amazing drug enhancing musical times. AFX, FSOL, autechre, black dog, 808....wonderfull times. and this is a classic."
4,Great Album,Love this album.LOts of great rhythms. Sit back pour a nice drink and relax or get up and groove - something for everyone
4,One of the better radios out there,"I got a pair of these radios for 125 bucks, which is hands down the best deal anywhere, local stores and internet included. These radios have the standard, 14 channels, 38 subcodes, but they also have a scrambling option which isn't foolproof, but keeps most people away. This radio has many options, you can turn all the beeps on, (talk confirmation tone, button press beeps) or all of them off or any combination, the lcd display is well lit, despite what is said at Cobra's website from the dirt and road review. The retractable antennea makes this unit extremely portable, when it's down, the radio is little bigger than a pager. All in all, the best radio out there save two or three VERY HIGH PRICED MODELS, (microtalk3, kenwood, cherokee, each at least 100 a peice.) So, go with these radios if you want a compact, clear radio with more than the basic features."
5,Great radio for the price,"After playing around with other brands and several trips to the discount stores, I've settled on the Micro-Talk 2. Car to car on the freeway, I get about 3/4 mile range (pretty good for 500mW). I get about a mile from the car to the house. Compared to a 4Watt hand held CB, this kicks butt."
3,;not what was expected,"my granddaughter was not real impress with it she was hoping it would be like the first movie, but it was okay"
1,Not worth it,"This should have been a half hour Christmas special.Why did they hang onto it till February for release? And priced like a full length, I feel cheated.BTW, what mother dragon goes off with Hiccup and leaves her eggs behind."
1,Another assault on Christmas,"It looks like Christmas....wreaths, snow, even a decorated tree. But it's NOT. It's snogllesomething....as it states. Another assault on the Christian Holiday."
2,Not Really a Training Book,"I was looking for a trick training book and bought this one. Not much about real training. It is just one view of how someone did it with their horse(s). The stories are a little far fetched and so is the training. I wish it had more substance and not just a ""this is what I did and it worked"" mentality. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to trick train their horses. It may cause more problems than bring fun to your training."
3,Methods are too advanced,"For example, one of the tools she recommends is the halter with chain over the nose for more ""persuasive"" effect. Unless you know already how to use this halter, don't start here. This type of halter can seriously hurt a horse unless used properly."
5,Big Screen Free Cell,It takes a few minutes to get used to the screen. Reading the instructions really helps!! Once you get the hang of it it's great. My husband plays this every day. It's great to cart along to a dental or doctor's appointment - makes that time in the waiting room seem short!
1,Big Disappointment,"No one in our family--including our 25-year-old gamer son--could figure out how to use this thing! A huge disappointment. If it were possible to give ""no stars"" I would!"
2,"So good, addiction is possible","I just can't put this game down. I learned it on the computer so I was familiar with it but this is so portable. Only one thing that is missing, is the undo button. That would make it perfect."
4,Expensive,I have had 2 Radica solitaire games in the past. I have had a $15.00 hand held game and the more expensive one that cost approximately $45.00. I ordered 2 last year through Amazon and sent the cheaper one to my daughter. There is absolutely no difference between the two. Lesson learned!
4,Beats Solitaire,"We gave this as Father's Day gifts to our sons and sons-in-law. They like the fact that it is possible to win this game. Radica's Solitaire drove them crazy because it was so hard to win. Free Cell, on the other hand, with a little ingenuity, can be won frequently. They like the fact that the game notifies you when you have reached an impasse. Additional pluses are the lighted background when in a dark room, and the fact that once you have reached a winning configuration, the remaining cards are stacked automatically for you. The game needs batteries, which are not included."
5,Freecell game,I have used one like this for 5 years. I keep it in the car and only use it when I take my husband to the Dr. or when he's in the hospital. It is a fun toy. Highly recommended. I bought this one for my friend that is going on a trip and is also a city bus rider in Tacoma. She'll use it a lot.
1,It's a short life,Bought this for my wife who wore out her previous Hand-Held Free Cell game.This new one lasted less than a week when it malfunctioned to the point ofbeing useless.
1,Display is no good,"The display on this is absolutely horrible. You know how each number window must be able to display any card or letter in the deck. But the numbers/letters that are NOT being display at the time, are almost as dark as the number that IS being displayed. So each number or J,Q,K,A looks like jumbled mess. It's very hard to decipher what is showing. And the back light does nothing to help either. I would not recommend this at all. It's a waste of money."
3,No more shuffling,Nice hand-held version of this electronic game. The only complaint from the receiver of the gift was at you can't see all 52 cards on the screen... you have to scroll... which make the game harder to play that the PC or standard card version of the game.
4,Hand held game,I purchased a previous one that wasn't quite what I needed. The toy is for an older lady who loves playing the game and I needed a big screen for her to be able to see it better. This one is perfect!
4,Freecell Handheld Game,"I needed a hand-held game to play in situations where I couldn't sleep and didn't want to deplete the battery on my phone. I'd had a surgery and did a lot of sitting around, recovering. I purchased this as an adult recreation, not a kid's toy. It is fun for me."
1,Not much fun,"I really wanted to enjoy this but it's not like the game on my computer (as stated in the description) the card piles are all the same and worse, there is no undo button which for those of us just learning the game, is essential. Once you move a card, that is it, no mistakes allowed. Perhaps this game is only for those who really know the game and somehow can make this thing work and have fun. I found only frustration."
3,ARE YOU KIDDING? THIS IS 129.99 AND THE OTHER 229.00 WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE???,"MY MOMS PLAYS THIS BUT I HAVE NEVER PAID THIS MUCH EVER FOR ONE, I THINK THE MOST WAS $12.95! $129.99 OR $229.00 ARE YOU CRAZY? I JUST DON'T GET IT."
3,CRAZY OLD EYES,I wore out my first one and since i don't see too well any more I decided to get the big screen. it's okay except my numbers are soo faint. i expected them to be much darker. Batteries brand new. Anybody else???
5,Replacement for an extended-use game,"I purchased this as a replacement for the same exact game that my wife has played OFTEN for many years. Hers was becoming worn, but functioned pretty well. I found the game through the manufacturer's website and ordered it through Amazon. She is VERY pleased with the new game; it's just like the old one. Glad that some good items are still around and available."
4,Very useful reference,"This is a very useful source for duties of NCO's, military organization, the articles of war, and so on as they ideally were at the end of the Civil War. Reading this, one immediately sees that some of the organization, efficiency and filling out of many forms probably never really happened in the field. Still, it's useful in telling the researcher how people thought things should be. If used with caution, it's probably fairly accurate for Southern armies as well."
5,Handy book,"This reprint of the 1865 Customs of Service is a great tool for researchers, re-enactors, or anyone who is interested in the way things were in the mid-1800 Army. Printed from the 2nd edition, it includes plenty of topics of interest."
1,Out of date immigration forms,"An opportunity lost. The kits sold by American Immigration Network include many out of date forms that can ruin one's visa application at step one. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and given the incompetence found that affects something so potentially life-changing, I would advise readers to search Amazon for alternatives rather than purchasing this time."
2,Uf!!!!,Jane Eyre parece la madre de Mr. Rochester y se supone que es una chiquilla.La elección de los actores fué pésima.
1,Review of Wood Windsor Chair,"I just recieved these chairs and they are extremely uncomfortable. The top of the chair lands squarely at the center of your back and presses on your spine. Look for a chair that has a wider top that molds more to your back, the way a chair should be made. Stay away from this chair."
5,winsome wood does it again,"We purchased new chairs to match our kitchen table because the old ones were so wobbly and would shift back and forth. These are very sturdy, matched perfectly, and we haven't had any wobbling issues. Have purchased 3 different furniture items from this company and have been very pleased with their quality! John 3:16 ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."""
2,"Small, nice looking, but one arrived broken","These are particularly nice looking, and very compact in size. Not the most comfy chairs for larger-sized folks, but functional. I was happy to have small chairs to go in a small room and I liked their looks. But one out of two was broken -- either before arrival or within the first hour of use. One leg had broken off, just below where it was attached to the seat. The break enabled me to see that the chair legs are not solid wood. Two of these chairs for this price are a great deal, but one for this price is far too expensive for this quality."
1,Horrible & Dangerous,"These are terrible chairs. Customers should have to own a product for a minimum of three months before writing a review. These chairs should last longer than that and they won't. Two of the six chairs in our set have broken with a person sitting in them. No one in our family has weight issues. I am online now to purchase replacements for the chairs.We purchased the pedestal table with the chairs as a set. It is nice and has held up well. My daugher has a friend with the same table set. This family had to place the set in their basement, out of use due to the chairs. I have a larger bruise on my hip and leg that was caused by one of the chairs breaking when I was sitting in it.DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR!"
5,Good solid comfortable chairs.,"These chairs arrived completely assembled and in excellent condition. Solid, well built and very comfortable. The design fits the back well. Very sturdy construction. Highly recommended."
3,Winsome Wood Windsor Chairs,These chairs were exactly what we were looking for. We already had a set of four and two of them broke. and we wanted to replace them.
4,Winsome Wood Assemb;led chairs,"I like the chairs so much that I ordered 2 more. They did come all assembled and delivered right to the door in one big box. They are sturdy and black as they stated.I am very please with Amazon.com and the no shipping costs, the product and quick delivery"
2,Safety Concern,"We've had these chairs for about 3.5 months. They looked great, came fully assembled, and are satisfactorily comfortable to sit in. The only problem is that the leg of one of the chairs just broke off at the base where it is attached to the seat. There's no way to fix it. I've been the person primarily sitting in this chair, and I'm relatively thin, so I would have to say that this chair receives a 2 star because it is not sturdy or durable."
1,These chairs are pure junk,"I bought 8 of these chairs and was thrilled when they arrived. They looked good...but I have found they are not so good. Half of them had to be thrown away because they broke... and the other ones are well on their way. If you are looking for chairs that just sit and look pretty...these chairs are for you....I contacted the company through an email and they have yet to reply..it has been several weeks....so my warning is: Buyer beware....the price is cheap and so is the quality of the chairs!Amazon is my ""go to"" website...I love their products..I have always been satisfied....this is a first...and hopefully the last purchase I make that will prompt me to make a negative review."
1,INFERIOR QUALITY,"I READ THE REVIEWS ON THESE CHAIRS AND THEY WERE MOSTLY POSITIVE. THE PRICE WAS REALLY REASONABLE BUT THE QUALITY OF THE CHAIRS IS NOT. I WOULD HAVE GLADLY PAID MORE TO HAVE THEM ALREADY ASSEMBLED (THEY WERE NOT)AS I THOUGHT THEY WERE ACCORDING TO THE DESCRIPTION. LOTS OF NICKS, SCRATCHES, PINHOLES, AND THE WORST OF ALL IS THEY DON'T SIT FLAT. NOTHING WORSE THAN A ROCKING CHAIR BECAUSE OF UNEVEN LEGS. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS INITIALLY REALLY GREAT OFFERING ME ANOTHER CHAIR. WHEN IT CAME IT WAS THE SAME AS THE OTHER ONE IF NOT WORSE. NOW I HAVE 2 CHAIRS THAT ROCK (AT LEAST 3/8-1/2"" OFF THE FLOOR ON ONE OF THE BACK LEGS). WHEN I TOLD THEM THIS THEY SAID I SHOULD TRY TO MAKE ONE GOOD CHAIR OUT OF THE TWO DEFECTIVE ONES THEY SENT.....END OF STORY. CRAP SHOOT ON GETTING ONE THAT ALL THE PARTS FIT RIGHT. THE HOLES DIDN'T LINE UP ON ONE OF THE CHAIRS....SEAT BOTTOM TO THE LEGS. DISAPPOINTING."
2,mixed,"Price is good..came in good shape, but not so sure great for every day use. Ordered two sets and they seem wobbly..and I have glued one back together already..and no one is big in my home really. Low use actually. Guess you get what you pay for."
5,black windsor chairs set of two,We ordered 2 sets. Both sets arrived without scratches or damage. Looks great with our table which also has turned legs. Finish on the chairs is a matte black not a shiny gloss which is what we wanted. Feel comfortable too!
5,Set of 2 Chairs.... Fantastic product,These chairs were really inexpensive and very sturdy. I went to the local furniture store and they were charging 3 times the amount! These chairs are really sturdy and are attractive.
4,winsome wood winsor chair,"I bought those for my rental home online. I havn't seen them yet but our friends assembled them for us. They say they are sturdy and are identical to the chair that broke. I have saved a fortune as my management company would have tried to source them on our behalf, and assemble them"
5,Winsome chairs,"I used these chairs to decorate an adjunct office for our part-time faculty members at Westchester Community College, Valhalla, NY. I inserted bright red cushions to give them just the right ""pop"". Now everyone wants me to decorate their office. One full-time member told me she had been in her office for 20 years and it never looked as good! Thank you for such a good product!"
4,Great creative gift for all ages,My grandsons loved making sand art designs in bottles. THis is a great creative arts and craft experience. Highly recommended.
3,Don Sickler,This is a nice record. nothing earth shattering just good playing by some journeyman musicians ....Track 1 has 3 horns I'm not sure if it's an overdub or they brought someone in for one cut
4,silver dolphin,We are fans of dolphin and this pin seemed to fit well with our overall support of dolphin conservation. The pin is pretty and of good quality. It was a good buy.
3,"Hypnotic,subliminal suggestions,mind-over-matter","A hypontic, subliminal suggestion video that really works! I watched it twice a day for two weeks and I couldn't keep away from the gym! It reinforced your attitude to work harder and longer. Helped me through sticking points and progress on weight,reps,and sets. Helped me focus!"
4,if you just want chilli get the 1st ed,"Before you buy make sure you get the correct version. Whilst the 2nd version is ok, it goes too far beyond chili, I mean you have typed CHILI into the search engine and looked up this particular book right? The 2nd edition has too many supplementary things when all you need as a side for chili is rice, chopped onions/tomatoes and a nice cold drink.I really enjoy this book as it is simple and whilst slow, a great winter warmer. And everything tastes nicer the next day so keep that in moind when making a big batch! i have the 1st ed which only has the chili recipes and nothing else, its a nice small softcover book which takes up not much room and gives me chili and nothing else. Great book."
4,Logitech mm 50 portable iPod speakers,We bought these speakers so we could listen to music in our stateroom. The quality of sound is good for the speaker size. The only problem we have found is that the battery runs down quickly. Make sure you bring the AC cord for re-charging!
3,Has some problems,"I have had two of these, and they both seem to have the same problems. They work great with a dockable iPod, but do not work well on battery power when plugged into a laptop or other non-docking device, like an iPod shuffle. Even with a full charge, they shut off after about 30 minutes when plugged into my laptop. Subsequent pushing of the ""on"" button allows for 2-5 minutes of playing time. I can push the on button repeatedly to make it play for 2-5 minutes many more times, so it's obviously not a dead battery issue. There seems to be a problem with the on/off switch. This problem does not occur when the unit is plugged into an outlet.Another related issue is that it sometimes randomly turns on, which can drain the battery.Having said that, it works great on battery power with my 4G clickwheel ipod, as long as I don't have the volume up too high. And it appears to be the only portable speaker system with a rechargeable battery."
5,Logitech a winner!,"I ordered the Logitech speakers for my husband's birthday. I researched several different brands and was impressed by what I read about this particular brand and the price. Sure enough, my husband and our whole family love it and use it every day to play music in the house! The sound is very clear and can be heard in other rooms of the house. It is the perfect size- doesn't take up much space and can easily be transported. I highly recommend this product!"
5,Excellent product,"So far, we have been very happy with our Logitech iPod speakers!!! Great compact size and sound is excellent quality! Very reasonable price too."
3,Needs a bit more power,This is a nice little system that gives some clarity but it lacks some power. It would be a really great product if the speakers were able to give a little more volume especially in an open air setting
5,My IPOD Rocks,"Terrific portable speakers that defy sound and size logic. Get these above all other PORTABLE IPOD speakers. Travel case is a big plus, as is the sound expansion feature."
4,Nice speakers,"Good sound, easy to use. Only criticism is that if you want to have a permanent set up for use both with PC and with IPOD...you have to unplug the speakers from the PC for the IPOD sound to work. Other than that...I would recommend."
3,Died on me after 1.5 years,Pros: Great sound quality and can play very loudly when plugged inCons: Battery life gets shorter and shorter the more you use itUNIT DIED ON ME COMPLETELY AFTER 1.5 YEARS
4,Best of the true portables,"Having a Bose Sound Dock stationary unit, I wanted a portable unit to use on the patio, at the park, etc. My critera were a reasonable bass level and a rechargable battery unit. I didn't expect Bose sound quality from a portable unit. I researched carefully, even buying then returning the I-Fusion speakers (nice setup but no bass at all). Apple and Altec Lansing M7 have excellent sound, but are too heavy and use D cell batteries which are inconvenient, heavy and expensive. The Logitec mm50 has a fairly good bass, is rechargeable, and highly portable. Unless you want to use a plug-in cord only, this is the best portable available at any price at this time."
3,"Small system - small sound, but it's ok",This system is compact and will travel well --- particularly with its built-in rechargeable battery. This product is a good value for people seeking a convenient and highly portable system. Those seeking a rich listening experience are advised to compare with other systems.
4,"For a small room, this is amazing.","I have another, larger device but needed something for a small office. This product filled the bill. The sound quality is amazing from such a small device, especially at the lower volume I needed in this situation. And it takes up very little room on my desk. I'm a a happy iPod user with this thing. One month later, I did have a little scare when it stopped working, but a little homework clued me into a reset button on the bottom. With a paperclip, I performed successful ""surgery.""I bought another product for use in a bigger room Altec Lansing IM7,Altec Lansing inMotion iM7 Portable Audio System for 3G, 4G iPod Photos and iPod MinisI'd recommend it too. It will blow you away and was reviewed as having Bose sound quality at 100 bucks less."
2,Faulty speakers,When it works - it's fine.1. Can't keep it charged2. Can't get a 12voly charger for it.
3,Decent for the price...,"I grabbed this item on 'deals' sale at Amazon. For the price, the sound is pretty decent, though I find actually sounds better when heard from in a different room than where the speakers are located, go figure!Two complaints that keep me from rating it higher:1) My nano fits over the plug of course, but none of the adaptors fit it to hold it steady in place, so it sort of floats in the dock, and pressing any of the nano buttons rocks the iPod backwards. When I checked the specs before purchasing, I thought it indicated the nano was a fit ...2) trouble with the remote:a: The 'skip to next' button instead creates a stutter through the current song, and the only way to skip to the next song is to do so from the player itself.b: Also, power vs. play seem to get confused.I will contact Logitech and see if a replacement remote can be sent."
3,Small packages have their place,"It's small, lightweight, easily toteable. Sounds good, but no bass. Well, some, maybe...but don't expect more than you paid for. I'm happy with these speakers."
4,Great Speakers!,"These are realy good speakers by Logitech. The sound is too good and nice and crisp for almost all kind of songs.It runs off the battery too, so doesnt have to be plugged in into an outlet all the time.Very portable, can take it to any party.Also has an audio line in, so you can also play music from other devices.The surround sound button really works great!Just did not give it a full 5 stars, coz the bass tends to fart at full voume"
3,Logitech mm50 Portable Speaker System,unit itself works fine but remote doesn't work even after installing new battery. no manual was included. i've been trying to contact seller for help.
5,3G nano,"I love this system! It works like a champ with my 3G Nano - it came with an adapter that fits it perfectly. The sound quality is wonderful and it's very portable! I keep it at work, just the right size on my desk!"
2,nice sound but BAD BATTERY LIFE,"I originally gave this product a 5 star review because the sound was great, plus the size and travel case made it really convenient. Unfortunately, after using it for a few weeks now, I've discovered that the battery life is terrible. I find myself having to recharge it every few days even though I don't use it often!"
4,Great Value,"I bought these speakers refurbished to get a low price, and I'm very satisfied with the sound they produce -- super clean, decent bass for such a small unit, and plenty of volume. The biggest surprise is the built-in, recharagble battery, which allows you to uplug the unit and take it wherever -- with no loss of sound quality. The remote is nice touch as well. Overall, a terrific value at the $75 refurbished price I paid; my only complaint -- no owner's manual, which I had to download from the Logitech site. Still, for half the regular retail price, that was a small hassle."
1,remote broken,"sounded good, but remote was broken, so i returned it. i do have a set of their computer speakers which are excellent"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"PURCHASED THIS UNIT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND, FOR THE MONEY IT SOUNDED THE GREATEST. AFTER OWNING IT FOR 3 WEEKS THE BATTERY QUIT CHARGING AND WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE ANYMORE. SO NOW WE NEED TO SEND IT BACK TO LOGITECH TO GET A REPLACEMENT...SO AFTER SPENDING AROUND 150.00 FOR THIS WE NEED TO DISH OUT EXTRA MONEY TO SPEND TO GET THIS RETURNED. I WOULD RECOMMEND GOING WITH A DIFFERENT PRODUCT. THIS IS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHES....THOUGH IS SOUNDS GREAT"
1,Not happy,"My sister-in-law has these speakers and they work great. She bought me a set for Christmas and they cannot hold a charge at all. I just found this out, so now I will only get a partial refund. NOT HAPPY!"
2,IRAQvsHOME,This product was absolutely horrible. I buy this because it had a good rating but when I recieved my item it was dirty had missing pieces and was just a very bad product. Overall I am very upset with it.
4,The product is cheaper.... Do I get a refund?,I was disappointed to find out that this product is cheaper now then when I purchased it. I purchased this unit for $115.00 I see it selling now for $99.00. Is there any chance of o refund or credit towards my next Amazon purchase? Thanks for taking my review. Sincerely Derrick Chai
2,"Great Sound, Lousy Battery","While the product sounds great for the small package, and is quite portable, the battery life is worse than awful. I bought this to use at tailgating for football games, and was happy, until the battery only lasted three hours. I took it back, tried another one, and the same thing happened.If battery life is not important to you, the speakers definitely sound good for their size, but if you're looking for something with a reasonable battery life, this isn't it."
2,Great until it suddenly stopped working...,"I thought I found the perfect product. The sound is great, it's extremely portable and easy to use with a Nano, old iPod, and my iPod touch. However, it just stopped working one day and it never came back to life. I must say I really loved this device when it worked and I am still tempted to buy the newer version, but I'm still hesitant."
1,Bad Battery/Recharge,Worked fine on power supply. Never worked using battery after several attempts to charge it. This model may have been on the shelf too long and the Lithium Ion battery became too low to charge. Returned for refund.
4,good sound,"very good sound, but lacks deep base and high volume as expected from a small unit. Little distortion at extremes. good clarity and wide imaging. portability is great with rechargeable battery. works seemlessly with ipod."
4,Ipod Speakers,I bought this for my wife to use with her IPOD. It works fine. The Speakers have plenty of volume and it is a clear sound. The remote isn't all that impressive. It has a max range of about 12 ft. We have to turn the IPOD on by hand and then the remote can be used to skip or play songs and adjust volume. This is a minor annoyance.
5,Great sound for a small package,"For a small package, this unit has very good sound, a good remote. It is also handy to use with the battery power option."
5,Great Value - Clean Sound,"For this price, this is a great system. You won't get that full spectrum Bose sound, but the sound is clean. Highs are not tinny, and the bass isn't making that dirty rattling sound in the speakers. Better than expected."
4,Good Speaker System,"The system itself is very compact and looks great. It was quite easy to set up-- you simply select the right fitting for your iPod and plug it in.The speakers sound excellent, especially considering the size of the system (and the low price). The included remote is a nice extra, although it can be pretty unresponsive. Overall, I can recommend these speakers, especially at the low price point. I'm not sure I would have been so satisfied had I paid the original price of $149, but at this new low price, you can't really go wrong."
2,Not up to my expectations...,These speakers don't sound all that great for the price. I will return them for something else.
2,"Lots of promise, but doesn't deliver much","I was really excited about these speakers, despite the fact that its battery is built in (I always prefer standard batteries to utilize my own rechargeables - what happens when the battery unit in this goes bad?)But once I received it, I immediately was disappointed. There simply isn't enough volume to fill out even a small room. With so little sound, the quality is almost irrelevant and the usefulness goes to nil. I am very disappointed."
5,Excellent design and quality,"I'm not often impressed by product design, but Logitech nailed this one. It's perfectly sized (the width allows it to fit in a laptop bag), elegantly designed, AND the sound is outstanding. Add to this a great price, cool carrying case, remote, adapter sets for different size iPods, and a permanent rechargeable battery (with a 10 hour battery life on one charge), and you get the best in class. 10 for 10!"
3,Elegant design but not for audiophiles,"It is beautifully designed; very easy to move around or take with you when you travel. However, the sound quality is not great. I'm not unhappy with my purchase. However, I now realize, I should have checked out other brands before falling for this one's elegant design. I might want to do the same."
2,Disappointing sound quality,"I bought the product based on a review, and listening to it briefly in a noisy consumer electronics store. But the sound quality was so poor that I sold it on Ebay. I don't think you can get good sound quality in this price range.The product did not come from Amazon itself; Amazon acted as the liaison. The retailer has a terrible return policy, which is why I sold it on Ebay"
4,Not IPhone 4 Compatible,"Had several ipods over the years and these speakers work great with any of them. For anyone wondering if they work with the iphone 4 (verizon), they don't play or charge."
3,A great little device that died before its time,"This would be a 5 star review, but alas, our mm50 died today. In the middle of a song, the music stopped. The little blue light turned to a flashing red, and the blue could not be retrieved. We've had it for over two years, but until recently it was used almost exclusively for travel, which has been infrequent. After our ATHENA died, we brought this out to the family room and it's been used several hours daily for several months. Guess one of its integrated circuits fried, taking the mother board with it. Anyway, while still alive, this little speaker system was great. Traveled well, great sound, especially with the boost in use. I might even buy another one...."
4,Great Portable Speakers,"Was looking for multi-use speakers, and these are generally excellent. Fine for music, even in the car, even with road noise, although when listening to recorded books using the battery, the volume seems to drop off fairly quickly so road noise becomes more of a problem. I may be expecting them to do more than they were designed for, but I really dislike the FM transmitter route because of (even intermittant) static & the need for station relocation on trips. Around the house, plugged in or using the battery, the speakers are fantastic.The case is a nice feature--would have given it 5 stars too if it had a handle, and space to carry the iPod itself.The remote is also a nice feature, and works well when pointed directly at front of speakers & from distance of less than 20 feet. Would buy again."
1,It died with light use,Sad to say the Logitech 970173-0403 mm50 Portable Speakers for iPod just died out of warranty. This was a gift for my sister. She was very careful with this and neverabused it. Too bad they can't make them any better that is.
2,"Great sound, battery won't hold charge less than 1 year old","The MM50 has nice crisp sound, is attractive and light weight, comes with a nice custom fit carry case. I bought this for trips to play music on the road in the occasional motel room and for listening to music by battery power around the house. It's less than 1 year old and the battery has not held more than a 40minute charge for the last 6 months. Would have returned it but have been ill. Now I feel stuck and can not recommend this seemingly fine little unit as it only plays if plugged into the house power which is inconvenient. I like Logitech as a brand and am quite disappointed with this MM50."
4,Good combination of small size and sound,"As long as you don't expect ultra low bass, this is a great little, portable, iPod speaker system. Generally has good sound, but if the bass gets low enough the speakers will distort, even at lower volumes, but for guitar driven music it'll fill a room with sound with no problems.The carrying case is nice, but they really should have made space for taking the charger in it. For day trips it's not a big deal, but longer than that you're going to need to recharge and that means keeping track of the charger since it doesn't fit in the case. The remote is a nice touch, but you are fairly limited in what you can do - skip songs and volume are pretty much it.The best thing about this system is the size. It is very small and takes up very little space, and yet still sounds decent. If size and portability are big concerns, yet you still want reasonably loud and decent sounding music, this is a good choice."
4,pretty good,"I was very impressed with the portability of this item.. comes with a case and rechargable battery. I'm not sure that the battery life is 10 hours as promised, but nevertheless, it's great to have a rechargable battery. The sound is pretty good... it doesn't get as loud as i would like...but still worth it. It plays better than my other system even though the other is louder with better bass. Get another system to park at home."
3,Missing some logic,"the price was right, but the speakers have some design needs...very quick to run out of battery...can't increase volume much but if you do, you get speaker buzz in the bass range...metalic sounding in general...non intuitive use, just rather pedestrian attempt."
1,This Logitech item is a disaster,"This thing is a waste of money. The battery barely lasts, the sound reminds me of the tape recorder I had in the 80's when I was a kid and stereo sound was still a novelty. Save your money for something else!"
3,Smile!,"As is the case with most people, the Windsors are cuter when they're under the age of 5. Unlike most people, they can afford the best photographers in the world. This is not a profound book, just a pleasant book of pretty baby pictures--fun to look at."
2,Crab didn't pay attention to food,"Well I purchased this for our hermit crab as a treat, but all it ended up being was a decoration for the cage. The crab has no interest in these treats, but perhaps crabs have different appetites from one another."
5,Wonderful,"I love the smell of this Parfum Spray. My mother used to wear it and she gave me some as a gift years many years ago and I have loved it ever since. Wonderful and light not too powerful , just right. This is my very favorite. I highly recommend it you will love it."
3,"Good try, but not totally successful","I found that many of the wheat-free recipes didn't bake up with much 'oomph' in my bread machine. They were dense, hard, and sometimes overcooked on the outside/raw in the middle. When I tried to bake the doughs in regular pans in the oven, I often misjudged the correct baking temperature.There are better bread machine books out there, and many Internet sites contain spelt, rice and other non-wheat bread recipes."
2,Works On Stains but Odor Persists,"I used about 1/4th of a 32-ounce bottle on a urine stain approximately 3 inches in diameter in my carpet. Although it did a great job of removing the yellow stain, the odor persists after three applications and much scrubbing and blotting. Urine Off does a better job of removing odor but sometimes leaves a brownish-yellowish stain; Eco-88 removes both stains and odors but it is quite expensive. I would recommend Get Serious as a stain remover only."
2,Discolors carpeting.,"It discolors carpeting, making it completely worthless to me. Does a good enough job on odor removal (but so do many other products). It does not deter animals from revisiting and remarking the site."
4,Classic late-'70s Brazilian pop/jazz MPB,"This disc reissues two classic albums by Nana Caymmi (the daughter of samba composer Dorival Caymmi). The two albums are ""Nana Caymmi,"" from 1979, and ""Mudanca Dos Ventos,"" from 1980... Students of the '70s MPB scene will definitely want to check these out. [2006 joesixpack at slipcue dot com]"
1,Not worth your money.,"Not actually a 24 hour face. Cheap quality. Ok if you don't want a watch that lasts 5 years minimum. Nylon strap wears out within 6 months, watch battery did not last a year where I've had comparably priced watches last two or three at least. Dropped the worthless thing on the side of the road in Iraq."
1,"Great Looking, but very cheaply made watch.","So I should've known that I'd get what I paid for. Upon the first day of wearing this watch, the second hand stopped moving within the first two hours, the cheap plastic face cracked. The packaging the watch comes in is worth more. And to boot, the face is really small, and I have big wrists so all in all it was a bad purchase."
2,Light and Trite,"I expected a bit more than this book delivered, but not by much. It was humorous in a pretty weak way. Overall, not particularly good SF and the humor was so-so. Very 1940's slapstick space opera (or should that be operetta). It's a more or less entertaining light read if you want something that won't strain your brain in the slightest. If not, don't bother with this one."
2,Diplomats to the rescue! At least these are amatuers.,"As a long time fan of Dickson's Dorsai books, as well as his Drogon Knight books. I picked up this book for a nice light yarn. As such I wasn't disapointed, but Gordon is only rehashing the works of other good authors and suffers because of it. If you want a good book that doesn't challenge, you get this; if you want a book that pushes you into new thoughts about how to make the world better, try some of Gordon's other books."
4,Increible review,"Jamás vi semejante despliegue de energía para hacer una reseña de un libro alegadamente innecesario. Entonces de la reseña ni hablamos, aunque, bien pensado, sigue así que algún día te ganarás el gift certificate aunque sólo sea por contribuciones al peso.Queda claro que este libro es sólo para personas con sentido del humor."
5,Surprising and enlightening,"Wilhelm Reich's work on orgone energy is original, startling and written so the average reader can still follow and enjoy it."
1,A Beginner's Book - Not An Advanced Book,"This book is mis-labeled. On the back cover, the book is rated from beginner to advanced. This book is only for a *beginner*. The book totally stops once you are passed the gui config programs. Towards the back of the book in the server sections, important details are left out. Some chapters are a cut, paste, edit. Unfortunately, the edits took out important details. The ""Red Hat Linux 9 Bible"" is more authoritative than this book."
1,Didn't work for me...,"I returned if after using it twice. For single serving protein drinks, I couldn't even get it to blend the powder well or crush the ice cubes. Maybe it works better for larger quantities. The ""dispenser"" was a joke; it took forever. On top of it all, it was a pain to clean. I returned it and picked up the Bella Cucina Rocket blender which is designed for one serving. Works MUCH better and is a breeze to clean."
3,"Blends well, but hard to clean and put back together","This blender really does blend well, it crushes ice and frozen fruits well and makes nice thick smoothies. It has a nice stir stick to help mix the ingredients as it blends. When I purchased the blender I liked the thought of the dispenser. However, it is a big pain to clean and put back together! The dispenser alone has 5 parts that have to align exactly to reassemble. If not put together perfectly then the dispenser doesn't work and you get a big mess. It's okay for a cheap smoothie maker, but next time I would upgrade."
1,Broke the first time I used it,"It took a while for me to figure the interlocking mechanism, but after reading the aplique I figured it out.The very first time I used it the top part suck in the base and it would not come apart. After getting it freed from the base, I saw the the 'hold-down' tabs were broken and in pieces in the base.It is not eligible for exchange - refund only."
1,Doesn't cut it over the long run,"I bought this blender a year ago this month. I use it only on the weekends to make iced drinks in hot weather. It worked great for the first couple of months, then it started smelling electrical after about 30 seconds of ice crushing. I would crush ice for about 30 seconds then let it rest, and return to ice crushing. Last weekend is started smoking. It is still running (barely) but it is on its last leg. I would not recommend this product for ice crushing drinks. It is a great mixer, but can't handle the ice over the long run."
4,Powerhouse,This is a great little machine. I use mine often during the warm weather months. It has power to spare and the measuring lines for either 2 or 4 servings make for perfect drinks. One slight flaw that is rather annoying-it's very easy to get the spout cap screwed on crooked and then it leaks all over the place. Always make sure first that it's not leaking. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Excellent New Talent,"To be successful in the music business, one must have good original material, talent, and luck. Alice's song writing is excellent, and she has loads of talent. Alice's songs have real feeling. I found the entire CD to be excellent and am looking forward to her next CD."
5,she's the best,That's my cousin! I would love her music even if she wasn't.I listen to her music all the time.
3,somewhat disappointing,"While I enjoy the album slightly, I find it unsatisfying. Here are afew reasons. 1)Peacock's voice is not at all superb. 2)The songsmostly get by on washed-up, tried and true formulas which lack originality. 3)Pop elements pervade the album and tend to have a negative effect. This contributes to the confused sound, a mix of genres including country, roots rock, and perhaps folk. 4)The lyrics aren't that great.Despite these criticisms, the musicianship is fine, good even. And most of the time the sound is tolerable. Standout tracks include My Love I Will, Get Your Own, and I Do.I suggest the superb Lucinda Williams if you are looking for great country-pop-rock music."
2,She sounds like Jewel.,"If this is to be considered ""alternative country"" music, i'll eat my ten gallon hat off of my ten inch belt buckle. Ok, so i only heard one song, but she sounds a lot more like psuedo-alty white female love song music than anything alternative, or country."
3,MYSTICAL EXTRAVAGANZA,"""OUT ON THE WILEY WINDY MOORS...."" The stunning first entrance of kate's fantastically unique voice on the best track on the album ""WUTHERING HEIGHTS"" A great debut"
2,Like needles pricking the eardrums,"Listening to this album is a real disappointing experience for me.I hear a lot of songwriting talent here, and many of the songs have beautiful melodies. The instrumentation is always tasteful and well done also.So what's wrong? Simply, I just cannot withstand Kate's voice. I tried...I can't. The song ""Wuthering Heights"" is a perfect example. Great songwriting. Wonderful melody. But she sings it like a mouse on helium. It needs to be at least an octave and a half lower, and sung by someone that doesn't have the annoyingly shrill qualities of Kate Bush's voice.In the end, this one factor completely kills my enjoyment of this record. I still have it in my collection -- but it is an example of a time I took a chance on a new artist and came up short."
5,The Best Record of All Times,"I was 12 yers old when I first heard the music from The Kick Inside. It was one of my favorites. Since then I have had many favorites, but usually only for short time. Now I am over forty and The Kick Inside is still one of my favorites. This is absolutly the best record of all times."
5,The Original Sissel Album,"This was her debut album, actually released in 1986 when she was just starting her career as a teenager. This immediately because very popular in Norway, and any visitor to Norway who wanted ""ekte"" (real) Norwegian songs/culture and folktunes.Her style has since matured some, but her voice was still as beautiful then, and I still think this is one of my most favorite Sissel albums."
4,"Not a literary masterpiece, but a great read nonetheless","This book is the perfect companion piece to James Ellroy's American Tabloid. While Tabloid is a fictional account of the events leading up to the Kennedy assasination told from the FBI/CIA point of view, Double Cross is (supposedly) the story told from the Mob's point of view. But there are some pretty interesting similarities in the details. Also a great portrait of a man who really knew how to get things done. The manipulations, intimidations and political gameplaying are all the more interesting because they happened in the flesh, not in some fiction writer's head."
1,Very Stanky,"This book reads like it was written by 14 year olds stroking their own egos. DOUBLE CROSS is hardly about Sam Giancana and more about Chuck Giancana. I guess if you're into Chuck it's a great book, but most of are not. I'm sad I wasted the green on this thing. Capisce?"
1,"A poorly written book, about a vastly overestimated gangster","This is yet another in the long line of mob books, that makes the laughable claim that the ""Mafia"" was responsible for the deaths of John Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. Every serious historian has long ago concluded that the Mafia NEVER had anywhere near the power it would have taken to assassinate the President of the United States or a powerful senator like Bobby Kennedy. Sam Giancanna was a two bit, cowardly hoodlum, who hated the power of the ""Irish"" Kennedy brothers, and therefore began telling tall tales about engineering thier deaths.This book, written by Sam Giancanna's brother, is just another biased re-telling of the lies spread by his ego-centric brother. This book is not to be taken seriously, and neither was the idiotic Sam Giancanna."
5,Double Cross,"The book is a great expose on the Mob and it's influence in American life and politics. I'f recommend it,it's a great and easy read."
5,Famous Quote in book.,"I tried to find this quote in the book with the ""search this book"" option and when it came up, you could not find the page number of the quote as it would not pull up. So here it is if anyone is looking for the reference to one of the most famous quotes from Double Cross: In the book ""DOUBLE CROSS"" - written by Sam & Chuck Giancana (Warner Books -1992) - on Pages 356 & 357, the Giancanas state:""Most of those who were involved in the 1963 assassination of President JohnF. Kennedy have been murdered. Some have committed ""suicide"" or spent theirfinal days in prison, while others still linger behind bars.""There are some men, however, if we are to believe Mooney's (Sam Giancana's)tales of Mafia-CIA counterintelligence activities, who've prospered andremained free. Amassing incredible power from careers deeply rooted in theCIA,these men have reached America's loftiest positions of authority, from whichthey continue to influence world events."""
4,"Know the truth, and it shall make you mad.","Historically correct and fast-paced, this book goes a long way toward answering nagging questions about events occurring in our lifetime which ""just didn't seem right"" at the time. The Warren Commission report, Bay of Pigs debacle's explanation and other events ""covered"" by the press (covered up?) are seen in new light. A tour through American politics and business from their darker side."
5,Authentic book on Mafia history,"Great Biography about Sam Giancana written by his brother Chuck. Chuck goes into geat detail about Sams life and how him being tortured by his father ultimately gave Sam the capability to commit violence/murder and not have any remorse or emotions toward his victims.Other reviewers have picked holes a few bits of info here an there in the book. Fact is Giancana worked with the CIA, had affairs with hollywood starlets, his ex-girlfriend acted as a gobetween JFK and Sam, was killed/silenced before he was scheduled to go in front of a congressional committee to disclose what he knew of JFK's murder by either the mob on payment from the govt or from CIA assasins.Great book. Very entertaining. I recommend this book as well as Last Testament of Lucky Luciano, and Breakshot by Kenny Gallo."
2,"Fascinating, but literature?","I'd like to emphasize the large difference in the two parts of this book. The first part is extremely detailed, so detailed that a lot of the conversation must be made up to fit a general recollection of the incidents. The second part is the alleged involvement in the Kennedy murders. Only prior knowledge of these theories gives any credibility to the claim. However Giancana's story fits quite well with Oliver Stones movie. Although the subject and historical aspects are very interesting the literary value is limited. SO 2 stars."
1,Pure Fantasy,"I was hoping for a realistic look into the Chicago mob, but instead got a bunch of hogwash about how Mooney controlled everything in the world. I'm surprised Chuck didn't claim that the sun revolved around his brother, that would have about as much credibility as most of the other BS in this book. I'm about 2/3 of the way through and I'm only going to finish it because I want to make sure he really dies in the end."
5,excellent and as described...quick deliver,fantastic...free shipping.....excellent product....will be my choice from down on. The colors are correct and excellent... went to a cookspecialty shop and they had high prices with the wrong size and nasty color combos..... these are the best.
5,Classy Feet,"This is a beautiful, elegant shoe, well made, and comfortable! Although is has a low heel, it is very dressy and makes you feel like you are wearing high heels!!! This is my first pair of Martinez Valero, but not my last!!!!!!!! A very happy cutomer."
4,Great phone for the price,"I was pretty suprised at how well this phone worked. I was basically looking for a cheap speaker phone, as I was planning on putting it on mute, listening in on meetings, and picking up the reciever if I had to say something. The sound quality ended up being so good, I use it without the mute. The sound quality both for me and the recieving party is better than the one at my office. The one caviat is that the speaker and mike operate off the power that comes through the phone line. Because of this, if my wife picks up the other line, the sound in both directions becomes very faint. The manual says that this is the case, and says that if you have several phones, this can happen as well. I have 5 phones on the line, and as long as they're all hung up, everything works great."
1,really want to love this phone ... but i can't,"this phone has all the makings of a great device. very good button layout, all the functionality one should need, a pleasant feel in the hand, an attractive package. BUT IT SUCKS!the sound is nearly unusable. on the handset, people tell me i sound really quiet. on the speakerphone, they can barely hear me. on the headset, they can't hear me at all. additionally, the speakphone output fades away when there's even a little bit of ambient noise in the room -- this is a common problem with home office phones but it's exceptionally bad on this model.i've tried returning this phone and getting a new one a couple times but to the same result. i contacted AT&T to see if they could help but they gave me the cold shoulder. it's no use -- this phone is awful.i really want to like this phone but it can't. i'm only holding on to it until i can find a good, corded, two-line phone that works. any suggestions?"
3,Missing a couple key features,"This is a good, but not great phone. It's missing a couple key features found on other phones that could have made it much better: 1) a call timer within the display and 2) date and time of day display (rather than caller ID info from the last call) when the phone isn't in use. Other than that, things are pretty good with perfectly acceptable call clarity on the handset, pleasant ring tones with an incredible range of ringer volume choices, and a slew of features typically found on a multi-line phone.My phone did experience hit-or-miss number dial pad keys that started needing to be pressed really hard, so I disassembled the phone and used rubbing alcohol to clean the contact points on the printed circuit board, as well as clean the round black dots that make contact with the circuit board when the number buttons are pressed. It wasn't hard to put the phone back together, and after I did the work the dial numbers worked like new again."
5,This play will one day be a classic!,"I had the honor of being a part of a production of this play. I found the woman in the scene called ""The Defencless Creature"" most enjoyable. She had heart and soul. And was very funny. She was your typical crazy loud nut case. But she stole the show. I was amazed at how funny she was. And the actress who portrayed her was brilliant!"
4,Be forewarned,"This is an excellent facsimile edition of the original publishing in the 19th century. Be forewarned, though, that the publishers have made an error (which may exiat in the original edition from which this facsimile is taken, I don't know). Page 372 of this edition is numbered in sequence, but is a repeat of an earlier page. Thus, when you are reading of Sir Joseph's adventures in Batavia in November 1770, you are reprised with a page dated May 1770. Infurtiatingly, you then miss the appropriate page and miss, sadly, the death of Tupia.With that caveat, This is an excellent resource, in some ways better than Captain Cook's Journals (though I feel blasphemous in saying that), and as fien a recreational read as you will find in many a year. It also surprises me how much science they actually knew in the late 18th century."
4,Nice addition to memorabilia collection,The 3-D logo was a nice addition to my memorabilia collection. It added some 'neutrality' to the give-away items and autographed balls and photos. It is very well made and prominent.
1,Image doesn't match what I received,"The image of this item depicts a Tiger leaping through the D; however the item I received contained no tiger, just the D. It was a gift, so the recipient doesn't know that it should have looked different, however I do and I'm not pleased with the bait and switch used by the seller. I won't do business with ""The Memory Company"" again."
3,Spinning her wheels?,"Don't get me wrong, I've loved her stuff since Fairground Attraction and think this cd is enjoyable. But the album isn't as special as some of her others.If you like Eddi's style, try and check out Mark Nevin's ""Insensitive Songwriter""(he's her old FA partner and writer of some of her best solo songs, too). It's a brilliant collection of songs, recorded with the man himself on guitars and Roy Dodds and Roger Beaujolais(both from FA). Eddi would be well-served to cover his ""You Don't Have to Make Me Laugh"" on her next outing...."
4,Eddi still rulz!,"Yet another great work by Eddi. Her voice is angelic as usual and her continued work with boo hewerdine proves that this is a match made in heaven. My wife and I fell in love to the sweet sounds of Eddi's voice and look foward to many more offerings by her. If your a rabid eddi fan like I am, this cd is a must add to your collection. Thank you Eddi for you wonderful voice, and sharing it with the rest of the world."
3,Classical Kids Collection,This collection was as presented but the video is a bit long for kids and I had to break it into smaller viewing times. I wouldn't buy the others in the collection though as the video doesn't really match with the CD and the book.
2,Not as shown in picture,"I've been searching for curved bobby pins. When I saw the picture of these Flamingo bobby pins, they looked curved to me. I ordered a whole box for 10.00 and 5.00 shipping. When I rec'd them, they're just plain old straight bobby pins. Although I could return them at my expense, it's not worth it 'cause it will cost me another $5 for shipping. The company should take these back at their expense!"
2,Completely misleading,"Even though the product image available showed a silver bobby pin, the product label said ""brown."" Now, I have some phenomenal old pins with perfect grip that are shaped exactly like the silver colored pin in the photo, which is why I took a leap of faith and ordered, hoping the product would be just like the photo but brown colored. Unfortunately, the pins are neither silver nor brown--instead they are a bronze blonde color that would work better on my fair haired roommate. Furthermore, the silver bobby pin shown in the product photo has a curvature to it which these bobby pins lack. They do have reasonably good grip, although not as great as I was hoping. The only bonus was that shipping was very speedy, which was nice given the 6 dollar fee for standard."
2,Too much emphasis on formal vocabulary,"In general, this dictionary lists the Hindi word used in formal contexts, where words of Sanskrit origin are more common, and doesn't list the words that are used in informal contexts, where people tend to use words of Perso-Arabic origin. For example, for the word ""question,"" the dictionary lists ""prashna"" when most speakers would say ""savaal."" If you use the words listed in this dictionary, people will tell you (as they told me) that you sound as though you're a character from ""Mahaabhaarat,"" the ancient Indian epic."
3,Mr. Doctor,"This CD contains some strong tracks, but very few. It's strayin' far from the Lynch Hung sound of EVIL, which I was looking for therein."
3,"Just get ""Retro""","For the dedicated KMFDM fan, this CD is a must -- if nothing else, ""Piggybank"" is worth it. However, if you're just looking for some industrial music and you're not a hardcore fan, just pick up ""Retro"". The best songs from this album can be found there."
3,A botched album,"This CD has some of the greatest KMFDM songs ever, but it also has some of the worst. Greatest songs: Naive, Die Now/Live Later (Borg Again mix), Piggybank, Achtung, Friede, and Disgust. Then there's the worst: Go To Hell, Virus-Pestilence, Godlike-Doglike, and Leibesleid. Find the original Naive if you can, this one is lame."
2,Don't buy this phone!,"I bought this Southwestern Bell caller ID phone solely because I wanted something inexpensive and small for my desk. What a mistake! Every time I get a call, I have to lift the entire unit close to my face to see the caller ID. Sometimes when I pick up the handset to make a call, I don't get a dial tone until I click on the cut-off button.It looks nice, but feels cheap. Even for the slight cost, this phone is not worth the money. Although it stores a sizeable list of incoming calls, erasing the list takes a fair amount of time if you've built up more than a few calls.Buy yourself a more expensive phone. This one isn't worth the effort of ordering."
2,Not recommended,"Pro: Cheap ... it works ... so far.Con: Sound quality is bad, noisy, and low (turning ithigher amplifies everything: noise, echos, etc).When you talk into the mouth piece youhear your own voice in the ear piece. So ifyou and the other end speak at the same time,you can hardly hear them (lot of ""sorry what?"").None of my existing phones does this.This thing is cheap, feels cheap, Smells cheap(bad plastic smell). LCD is not backlight, and ishard to read. Batteries Not included (3AA).*Sigh* hopefully someday China will make better products."
1,Not Good,"I purchased three of these phones when I added caller ID to my service. I was disappointed when I started to notice a clicking/humming sound on all three phones. I moved phones aroundto no avail. My 1 Radio Shack and GE phone were fine. I took the phones to a friends house, plugged them in and got the same problem. I contacted the manufaturer, who of course, told me they had no complaints? Additionally, the caller ID box is too small and angled in the wrong place. You need to mount the phone about 7 feet up in order to see the screen. The only thing I liked about it was the back-lit dial and event though it had alot of humming/clicking the volume was good. I returned all 3 phones, which I purchased at 3 different locations over a 2 week period. All the lot numbers were different, so I don't suspect it was a batch problem. Back to the drawing board on this one SW!!! Now I have to find a phone that works better. The AT&T 240 is suppose to be a better buy, we shall see :)"
2,"Take mine, please","I bought two phones, this one and the ATT 240. The only thing good about this phone is it works; however, the sound is bad, and the caller ID hard to read. The ATT 240 works much better, period."
2,Would not recommend it.,"Iwall mounted it (had a hard time winding the ""hard wired"" cord). In that position it is impossible to read Caller ID. That feature (?) is useless. Ring & sound OK. I think I am going to look for a better phone and move this one to the basement or garage"
1,dont waste your time.,"if your looking for something cheap then i guess go with this, but there will be a hassel. its impossible to put on the wall, and after awhile, you can barley read whose calling you. after a few months i gave up on it and threw it away. not worth the cheap price. go with something more expensive."
2,Invest in a magnifying glass!,"I have had the freedom phone trimline fm2552 for over a year now and i still have to turn it a certain angle towards the lighting in my home to see my incoming calls on the caller-id. By the time i figure out who has called, they have hung-up! Other than that feature, it works alright."
2,Fair Phone for the price,My main complaint is there is NO call waiting caller id (If I would have known that I wouldn't have purchased it)... Just the standard caller id is included with this slim white phone. The lcd display is alittle small so you need to squint to see whos calling you. Good little phone to have next to the computer though.
1,SW Bell wall phone,"I purchased this phone to replace an exact (I thought) same one that I have had for years and that had a problem with the buttons. This phone is NOT the same as the older one. The Caller-Id display is hard to read, the ring sound and volume is difficult to hear from another room, and the phone just seems to be inferior to my previous phone."
4,A solid album from Mr. Afinque,"This album is lead vocally by Junior Toledo, which to me, is greatly underrated. ""Arrepentidos Pecadores"" is a great song that will make you reflect on your own life in a way. ""Soy Rumbero"" is a funky song with Justo Betancourt-ish lyrics. ""Todo y Nada"" and Larimas y Tristeza"" are two boleros of which I'm not a big fan of. ""Ajiaco Caliente"" is a instrument wise a funky one to say the least. The best track for me is ""Juventud Siglo 20"" which is an anti-drug campaign that combines great, meaningful lyrics with awesome hard-hitting music, topped off with Toledo's voice. The only thing that prevents from giving this a 5 star rating is the 2 boleros."
2,I was decieved- Not what I expected,Electro-Soma Bi2 --It's not what I expected. The tunes are very similar among themselves. Too simple and monotonous for what I really like to listen..
4,S.T.Rand's Dictionary,"A good reference for going from English to Mi'kmaq, but unfortunately Rand never got around to publishing the Mi'kmaq-to-English version. As a new student of the Mi'kmaq language, this would have been very useful! However, this is probably about the best in the world for researching the Mi'kmaq language."
4,Excellent Packaging Job,The bulbs were exactly as presented online; they work well in my kitchen. The packaging was excellent. Each bulb was in the OEM carton and over-wrapped with bubble wrap. Not one of the ten bulbs was damaged in any way.
3,MBT sandals,"The price and service/delivery were excellent. However, I have been told by my fitness expert that there are MBT knock-offs and I may have received a pair."
4,Interesting shoe,"This is my first MBT shoe purchase. This sandal is comfortable, adjustable, and well-made. I bought an MBT because of back problems. I am not sure if the shoe is helping or not."
4,Robust sandals,Only shoe in their line I can wear because of long toes.......very comfy and supportive.
2,disappointed,This was my first pair of MBTs. I was very disappointed. They are not comfortable and are very clunky and awkward to walk in. I really expected more from the brand name MBT. Now I understand the big reduction in price.
5,Ugly but comfy!,"These are some of the ugliest shoes ever(not as bad as the full shoe style), but wow are they comfortable! This is my second day using them while strolling the baby around our neighborhood and my legs are already feeling the benefits. I won't be wearing them around town, but they're great for a workout!"
4,Comfortable sandal,It's a medical comfortable sandal. I received this item in perfect condition. Thanks for the seller he was helpfull and cooperative in handling and dealing with the freight to solve my problem. It satisfied my need.
1,Casio tv,"The tv itself cannot pick up any local stations because it analog,All broadcasts are in digital,The seller should have known that.So any else who wants to purchase one of these read my review,It belongs in the garbage,Do not buy one of these if you see one,"
5,Absolutely amazing,"If you love Christmas music you'll recognize a lot of these songs, even if you don't speak Swedish. Her voice is absolutely amazing, almost angelic in its purity. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Renactment of Klondike Gold Rush,"I've watched this review, and it is the best authentic reanactment of the Klondike struggle for Gold that I will ever see! I lived almost 30 years in the Yukon, and this show was FANTASTIC! It really depicts how terribly hard it was for the gold seekers...this was real challenge for the cast of 12 people who were chosen for these episodes...I don't think any of them would do it again, no matter how much money they were paid..."
4,Schulberg should be more famous,"WMSR is enjoying a nice revival at the moment, and it's time for this superior work to come into the sun as well.What's most arresting about Schulberg is his ability to infuse formulaic subject matter with pathos and humanity. He wears his politics on his sleave, but his characters don't suffer much because of it. In an era when partisan opinion is treated as graceless error, it's exciting to read someone who gives a damn about the sorry state of the world.Schulberg handles American vernacular speach well, but falters with his Argentine characters. Still, a rapid, crisp and entertaining book"
3,Explores both a physically brutal sport and brutal people,"If you are interested in boxing and like your tales full of insight into the darker nature of man, then go for this book. The characters are not complex, they might even be called cartoonish, but its a classic tale of how a man, a PR flack, loses his moral compass. Its written in the same style of a Hammett novel but the author's not quite as a much a master of the style. Nonetheless, a good period piece and boxing novel."
5,Just Buy It,"If you are a widower, just buy the book. Even though it appears to be overpriced (they could sell it for a lot less than the $47 I paid), it still is worth every cent. The insights into the 20 men featured in the book were extemely helpful to me in understanding my own grief. To much of what I had seen prior was aimed at a widow instead of at a man.I strongly suspect after reading this book you will feel it was helpful in finding your way down your personal path folowing the loss of a spouse. It is not a fun path to be on, but this book should help you recognize some of the issues you may face."
2,Ambitious and fresh with an offensively lazy conclusion,"I wanted to enjoy this novel as a whole and although I was captivated in the beginning, I was severely disappointed with the last quarter or so. There were some incredibly complex characters along the protagonist's expedition and then the two additional characters that are inserted near the end are never fully developed and failed to elicit any kind of interest. In addition, there were numerous grammatical errors towards the end of the book and I'm not referring to the very distracting ""drawl"" of the female character."
4,A REMARKABLE WORLD ALL ITS OWN,"This is a book I've been hearing about for some time, and I'm so glad I at last got around to reading it. To say it's a major work of speculative fiction doesn't begin to get to what this amazing work achieves. Some of the action / thriller aspects of William Gibson's writing is here--combined with the humor and absurdism of Vonnegut, but the result is something unique and unto itself. I only give this book 4 stars out of 5 because I think it's ambitions are so very high. I totally recommend this for anyone with an adventurous mind."
3,Back cover copy,"Nicola had never met Jason Wilde, but she hated him for the way he had hurt and deceived her sister, and was determined to be revenged on him.So she worked out a plan that seemed fool-proof. She took a job with the oil company for which Jason worked and managed to get out to Abrahm, the remote post in the middle of the North African desert where he was supervising. Miles from civilization and the company of women, he should, she reasoned, be an easy target. She was not exactly unattractive, and it should not be difficult to make him fall for her -- and then walk out on him in just the same way as he had walked out on her sister.But things did not quite work out in the way Nicola had expected, and fate turned the tables on her neatly and drastically."
5,My Dog Loves his Wee-Wee Pads,The Wee-Wee pads just fit the holder we have. We can use the pads anywhere the dog goes.I recommend these pads for anyone that owns a dog.
3,size is misleading,"I bought these because the package states that they are larger than the regular sized pads. This is not true. They are the same size and not ""adult"" size. Very misleading!"
3,wee pads,The pads are ok but could do with being a bit thicker. Adult dogs do big wee's! other than this they are not bad but wee does spill onto the floor as pad can't hold it all. If there are thicker ones I'd like to know.
1,Stay way,These are way too expensive and are terrible. I have a small dog and the pads leak onto my wood floors constantly.
5,Diabetic pup,My Bichon Lucky has diabetes. He gets insulin twice a day. One of his symptoms is excess urination. I have purchased Pee pads from many sources but consider the pads from Amazon the best value. UPS delivers very promptly. I have purchased them several times and the price and service is superior to all other vendors.
3,"Great for puppies, could be better","I have a 15 lb pug and she uses the pad 2-3 times a day (winter). Although this fits my schedule, comparing it to the Petco brand pads, it's much thinner in the absorbtion department. As soon as the liquid lands, it spreads out and that takes up about 1/3 of the pad. Since my dog will not pee on the same spot again, the pad has about a 3 time useage. The Petco brand is more thicker and the liquid will not spread out so far therefore you have a 4-5 time usage. Once you break down the amount of pads you use a day vs the cost, the Petco brand comes out cheaper in the long run. That's why this only gets a 3 star from me."
5,Good buy,"After comparison shopping wanting to get the best price without buying pads that didn't hold up to the moisture, I decided to go with these. Great price for a good product!"
2,Thin and not very absorbant,"I was disappointed in these pads, as they are thin and do not absorb very well. I find that the pad needs changing more frequently than others I've used. After using these up, I will look for another brand that works better."
2,These pads shred,I bought these pads to line the whelping box of a litter of 3 week old golden retriever puppies. They easily shred from their trimmed but still sharp nails. The Arm and Hammer brand at Target are about the same price and do not shred.
1,New design not good,"I've been buying these pads for 10 years and have always spent the extra money because they were better quality. Unfortunately their new quilting design causes the liquid to spread more and so we go through pads much faster. The liquid also ends up on the floor much more often. After being a loyal customer and recommending these to everyone I know with a dog, I am going to take my $1000 a year that I spend on these pads elsewhere."
2,Mom of 2 maniac yorkie pups,"For some strange reason, my two yorkie pups hate this style. As soon as I put it down in the holder they turn the pad into confetti! The same company also makes ""pee pee"" pads and they have more of a quilted surface. I can use that style with out my two ripping it to shreds. I'm hoping they will grow out of it and will try this style again on them later since I bought 100."
5,Works great!,"We have two little Chihuahua and a Yorkie where they spent most of the time in door. Getting them trained on WeeWee pads has worked out very well. The pad provides good absorbant, nothing passes through. We usually get away with changing just 1 pad per day. Overall great product. Easy to clean up, just throw it away. Will be ordering again."
5,Rug saver,My fifteen year old poodle can no longer hold her urine and these pads have been a life saver. I keep a pad on small throw rug by the front door and she uses them whenever. Saves alot of clean-up and odor. Highly recommend.
1,disappointed,"I would like to continue to order however, these pads are the OLD version of wee wee pads. I have gotten the current pads which are quilted and much better absorbtion. I will continue to order from Amazon if I can get the newest pad,and it is the same price. If you can direct me to an outlet that sells the newest pads it would be apprectiated."
2,They leak and are nor worth the money,"I was so disappointed whe I received them. My puppy usd the fist one and it ran all over the floor and on to the carpet. There is no aborbance what so ever uless they are inthe midde of the pad. When you teach them how to do that please advice. I will never purchase this producy again,"
2,Product Reformulation VERY DISAPPOINTING,"It seems that Four Paws has a new product formulation which I was looking forward to since recent shipments on the old formulation were often almost like seconds -- the batting/absorbency was inferior to the same product purchased for years. So, now there is a quilting or quilt-like formulation which is supposed to be better for absorbency. WRONG. I found now that the smell of urine is present after one use (which it never was before) and there is seepage since I have found several times the underneath (plastic) is wet with urine. I shall seek a new product; shame on Four Paws."
4,Good Quality Basic 2 Line Phone,"The AT&T 272 provides excellent quality, clear sound in an easy to use package. The phone appears to be well built and durable and it provides all the functionality needed for a basic phone. It works well with two lines and using the conference call feature is straight forward. The lighted buttons are a useful feature, especially in the bedroom where you might use the phone in the dark. The only real problem with the phone is that the ""line in use"" lights which are designed to indicate if an extension anywhere in the house is off hook sometimes do not work and you may find yourself picking up the phone while someone else is on the line. I would recommend this phone to anyone, especially at its price. The quality of this phone is far higher than most selling at its price point."
2,accidentally hang up on people,"when chatting on the phone, my cheek pushed the button on the handset accidentally hanging up on the person."
5,Liquid smooth techno soul from Detroit,This is aural sex. Electronica 90s style. Pure electro heaven. Why is America ignoring such talent?
4,Good monitor,Overal good quality monitor for the price.The only complain is that can not be checked/adjusted if video cable is not connected.
4,Great price; good monitor,"My son will be using his computer for home schooling classes soon, so I wanted an lcd monitor to replace his crt. This is a good monitor.I'll have to admit, I think my video card is holding it back. I have a video card that was good a few years ago. I tried switching to a great video card someone passed along to me not knowing whether it was faulty. It WAS faulty, but would work for a few minutes. Those minutes I could get higher resolution than the other guy reported, and 32 bit color. Even then though, the picture wasn't quite as crisp as the hp lcd I have on my computer.So back with my original card at 1024 x 7?? I get 16 bit color. I do need to update the video card...But even without the upgrade, and not being quite as sharp, at the price I am satisfied with my purchase."
5,Does the job and good value,"I used this montor for my 27 month old's PC. It's nice that it has built in speakers and the picture quality is better than I expected. We'll see how it handles the spreading of peanut butter over the screen at some future date I'm sure. But for now the monitor is good looking, presents a good picture and seems sturdy enough for my kid."
2,Wanted to like it!,"I always used to enjoy Keaton's movies, but lately he hasn't made anything worth a watch. This one is okay, but it just couldn't hold my interest it seemed. I really wanted to like it but it just drug on and on. I commend them on not needing explosions and all that crap to make a movie, but still Keaton couldn't capture the charm he had with his earlier films, which is what broke it for me."
5,Texas QLD 4385,"That song is the best ever, the guitars are the best...GO LEE YOU ROCK MY WORLD TOTALLY! LIKE YOU'RE NOT GOOD LOOKING, YOU'RE THE HOTTEST GUY IN OZ..KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK MANLUV ME"
5,Tennis anyone?,I bought them in order for my puppy and I to play fetch. He loves them and I will buy more in the future.
1,this album is crap!!!!!,"I don't know what happened from the album suffer system to this one...But these guys changed for the worst in a extreme way..This album was absolute waste of money..Not even one song caught my attention...They went from having a real original sound to a sound that bores the crap out of me and makes me want to plug my ears and sell this crap album...Which is what I did....DON""T BUY THIS CRAP...Check out Suffer system if you want a good album...."
3,Not what I've come to expect from this band.,"With their recent break up and reforming, Monster Voodoo Machine seems to have lost something (besides a couple of members). Their music has lost much of it's originality that came from having many members with varied musical backgrounds, and inexplicably (for a Canadian), the lead singer appears to have picked up a southern accent somewhere along the way. Being that ""Suffersystem"" is one of my all-time favorite albums, I had high expectations for this cd, which it did not live up to. They still are, however, a great band, and there are several good songs on this album, and the album is, as a whole, still quite listenable."
2,weak,"first off, i love this band. but i don't care for this cd. it is overall weaker than any of their other cds (except for defense mechanism which was a remix single that also sucked.) almost sold out. it's recycled alternative dribble. there are maybe 2 or 3 good songs on the cd...and they are just mediocre. it's just not the same as their old stuff. buy state voodoo/state control or suffer system. then write the band a letter and tell them to revert to playing hardcore."
2,Same Stuff w/a New Age Twist,"It's not much Fun, it's certainly not Revolutionary, and there's one heck of a lot of Sweat involved. If all you have to do with your day is exercise and ""find yourself"", this one's for you. The author thinks that fitness consists of simply finding something we like to do and then dropping everything to go do it.If you work for a living, have a family, cook, clean, can't afford or don't have time for the gym, mountain climbing, martial arts training or a spiritual retreat to find your ""Center"", look for another exercise guru.The author's suggested exercises from regular push-ups to good 'ol high school knee-busting ""burpees"" are not only old hat wrapped up in New Age personality testing and ""centering"" talk, but they're the kinds of exercises injuries are made of.I was disappointed. The book costs too much money to spend on very little real help."
1,Save your money,"I bought this thinking ""alright Porn Star and Death Metal"" well I should have just went with the gut and saved my money. Both of these ""Metals Darkside"" DVD are a sorry attempt of Jasmine St Claire to interview some legends of death metal. She spends most of her time inturpting the artist and and trying to smell their arm pits. and its advertised as uncensored videos which is not true there is still blur over the girls naughty parts. The only half way intresting interview is with the Black Dahlia Murder and that is only because those boys are funny as hell. I dont recommend this to even the most diehard fans of Death Metal. I took one for the team now learn from my mistakes. I have both if anyone wants them for free."
3,I do enjoy these books but...,"I have grown very fond of this series of books & have been waiting to read Kill's story with anticipation. On Kill & Marty's story alone I would have given it 5 stars. It is very funny in parts, which had me in stitches. I'm glad to see Marty standing up to Kil. Telling him no in her own way.The down part for me has nothing to do with Kill & Marty, but his nieces predicament. At the end of this book we have Dari who is 14 years old being sent away to live with her future sacred mate & his parents because she has caused him embarrasement. She cannot see her family only if her future sacred mate allows it. She has to live with him for 11 years before he can claim her. The scene with her parents after being told of her punishment was heart-breaking. I cannot believe Zor agreed to Gio's petition to have Dari removed from her parents home & into his custody. What kind of man does that to his own brother? With brothers like that who needs enemies."
2,You're kidding me right?,I don't know...it was just a tad unbelievable that a person who was interested in feminist rights and stayed with a warrior tribe of women would lose her complete mind and accept all of the sharing going on at the Conjugial Ceremonies. ...
2,Please enough with the Groovy...,"The strong female protaganist is actually a displaced hippy fresh from a 1960's bra burning rally. Unfortunatly, a metiorite catapults her into another dimension with huge men set on public sex.The book warns it should be read with Book 2...maybe Black should admit none of her books can stand alone. Details and reasons are lacking about what draws the two protaganists together or even what a soul mate is to this overgrown species of males.Secondary characters pop in and out of the book, no doubt awaiting their own novels with little or no explaination.The main character has one line she uses in every situation...Groovy.This book isn't groovy enough to own."
4,Trek Mi Q'an,"I must say all books -are good, for me the first two are even better than this one, but of course Jaid had written it well.It's the story about Marty- from earth and Kill, who is weary interesting character to me and weary scary and needed to be loved.So, Kill finds Marty and is attached to her presence in the battle, and want to keep her for him and so he puts her into a harem, so not nice at all, but a lot of fun.The story is full mix of feelings to his Sacred Mate. Kil wants her more than everything but makes a lot of mistakes.But in the end, story is weary good written, had a lot of nice erotic scenes and lot of surprises.I also like the scene about delivering the first baby!For me the first book ""The Empress' New Clothes"" was the best ewer!"
2,Never trust a Leo?,"This books pretty cool if your into the 'zodiac' stuff, like taurus and leo and etc.. but since I'm not this book was kind of corny. It had to much of this,"" Never trust a Leo"" stuff and bla bla bla in it. BUT, nevertheless.. if you are into that stuff then this is your book"
5,Fly Wheels Skate Launcher,It is a very good toy it is very durable and if you treat it right it will be in good shape for a long time!
3,"Good Book, but not Great","Having eagerly awaited another novel by the talented David Leddick, I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I loved his previous effort, My Worst Date. The casual stream of thought narrative continues in this novel, but I had a hard time believing the narrator was female. Regardless, the storyline moves along at a good pace with interesting characterizations. I will still buy his next novel, but hope he identifies more honestly with the narrator."
3,A Fun Read,"This is a book written in the first person about a woman, by a male author, and the protagonist is every man's idea of the perfect woman: beautiful, gorgeous figure, doesn't care if her boyfriend is a porn star who does it with men or women, financially independent, obedient, huge sex drive, and doesn't give a fig about her child (Hey, the boyfriend comes first in all aspects of her life.) In other words, this is a fairy tale for men.The book was first published in London, so the American characters have more typically British names like Edwina and Bertrand and wear ""knickers, but this comes off as more charming than distracting.If you'd like a nice distraction from the murder mysteries or diet books so many of us seem to be reading these days, I recommend this as fun, escapist reading."
1,The White Album,"This CD requires infinite patience to get through. What's unfortunate about it is it sounds like Leo won some studio time in a raffle drawing and didn't know how to spend it. Why not an endless tape loop of the sounds of Rice Krispies loosing their crisp, sped up to 78 rpm and fed into an 18 track processor, backwards? Awesome! Don't get me wrong, ""Shake the Sheets"" and the brilliant ""Tyranny of Distance"" certainly make up for this self indulgent stoner noise. But this is a tremendous skip even for the die hards."
1,Piece of Junk,"I ordered two of these saws. They are made in China. Both are difficult to open (the lock release button aligns poorly). In addition, one fell apart during the first 10 minutes of use will all the parts falling in the dirt. I was able to reassemble, but will have to glue the screw & nut together because if fully tightened you can't open or close the saw. Also the handle is too large (and I wear large mens gloves)! Don't buy anything from Bond line."
1,Terrible!,Powerplugs is not easy to use! This one only works on older versions. If you have 2010 powerpoint you can't use it. Plus any other powerplugs you might buy are not user friendly!
5,The Ultimate One-volume Christian Reference Work,"As is not surprising, considering the publishing source, the ""Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church"" is the foremost single-volume reference work of its kind. Indispensible for clergy, seminarians, and academics, this book is valuable and accessible for the layman as well. Regardless of whether you are Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant; regardless of whether you are liberal, conservative, progressive or revisionist; if you take any serious interest in the whys and wherefores of Christianity -- you need this book on your shelf.This volume is non-denominational and non-polemic. It does not seek to convince, but rather to inform. And it accomplishes its task with impressive thoroughness. Even if you already have an earlier edition, strongly consider this purchase."
5,Excellent reference,"I am a Postulant to the Deaconate in the Episcopal (Anglican) Church. As a student, this resource is without equal. Excellent information with Bibliographic information included in each citation. Excellent overall resource for anyone engaged in formal study of the Christian Church."
5,The Merck Manual of the Christian Church,"Having become thoroughly familiar with the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church in Seminary years ago, I purchased a copy of the most recent edition to use as a reference while studying Eamon Duffy's, ""The Stripping of the Altars:"" An excellent, revised history of Catholic England, beginning in 1400, and the several ruptures it received to its Catholicism during the Reformation period extending from 1530 to 1580. The Oxford Dictionary was indespensible in Seminary and is so once again. It seems especially useful for research in the major, historic Christian Churches of the West, i.e. the Roman Catholic, and the Anglican Communion."
3,The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church,"I was disappointed that it does not have a list of names, persons and places with how to pronunce them."
3,Not what I expected.,"I was looking for a testimony of how God led them to their ministry and the unfolding of it. Instead (for something like $7) it is a book with large print: a few short messages and mostly scriptures. Nothing wrong with a book of scriptures, but if the title is: THE MAKING OF A MINISTRY, then the content should reveal how the ministry was made."
3,Not what we were expecting,"The patterns are not detailed enough to duplicate. Great for ideas, if you are able to create your own patterns."
1,There she goes again...,"Picture it...sick dog on a lot of medication and I leave home for an 8 hour day at the office. No matter what I do, she smells and knows the spot. And this hard wood flooring. You ask did it work? GET SERIOUS!!! It didn't. I may not smell or see it. But she must because any sick moment, that's where she goes."
4,Not your average lit mag,"Conduit is a swanky publication out of Minneapolis that has made itself into a respectable national literary journal. Unlike many other lit mags, Conduit does not restrict itself to fiction and poetry, but instead weaves together the ideas of each issue through interviews with musicians, researchers, linguists, etc.,(see the issue with the interview of Rachel P Maines, author of _The Technology of Orgasm_...), visual arts nicely replicated right in this little gallery of a magazine, in addition to poems and stories. And the journal itself is a feat of graphic design. William D. Waltz is senior editor and each issue begins with his ruminations, an essay worth reading on its own. Conduit has established itself as a true conduit of ideas, as they say, ""for minds on fire."""
2,Nothing special if you've read other sports psych books,"I read this after reading ""The Inner Game of Tennis"", ""The best tennis of your life"", and some Vic Braden books. I only finished it because I bought it and wanted to be sure I didn't miss anything. If you've read any of the previous books / writers you'll be bored so its best to avoid the purchase.On the other hand if you have never come across any of the above books / authors and have never read any tennis psychology books then it might be of use. I do think ""The Inner Game of Tennis"" is a better read though."
2,Just another generic self help book,After reading `Winning Ugly' this book was very disappointing. Writing is boring and repetitive. It feels like the author only wanted to point out his importance by constantly emphasizing it. His idea would fit on several pages and really didn't need the entire book.
5,"""Ride"" is the reason I bought this CD","On occasion I spin discs as a DJ and the song ""Ride"" is always in my mix, kind of spooky then dramatic, swelling keyboards and vocals. Not as danceable as some of their other stuff, but it sets a mood that is intelligent, sophisticated and dignified.- DJ Joey Daytonawww.joeydaytona.com"
5,"Simply Superb ""Electronica""...","Almost could be ambient record, especially with standout instrumentals such as Maurautius, Object Orient, Imagine and Vacuous. But with PGP, Ride, Eye of the Mind... Ahh, forget listing titles, the whole album is simply fantastic. PGP and the brilliant instrumental Chromagnum are standouts, but it's like trying to find a skater in the NHL, you're not going to lose. Be warned though, this album is infinitely more mellow than their first, which was more of a ""rave"" album. Also has alternate cover art (vastly superior) that can be used with a little creative re-folding of the liner."
