4,Very good quality for the price,"I ordered 6 boxes (36 glasses) of these for an upcoming party last year (at the then excellent price of $39.99/set). As an owner of Reidel stemware, I found these glasses, though of somewhat lesser quality, to have an excellent shape, feel, balance and ring. They hold a generous serving of wine, and the shape enhances the bouquet of the winenicely. They also double as nice white wine glasses in a pinch. I prefer thin rim stemware, and these fit the bill beautifully for the price. They are also sturdy enough for cleaning in the dishwasher. Overall, a good value at $40."
3,Glasses are 5 Stars but Shipping is 1 Star,"The people in the shipping department need to learn how to ship fragile items. The box containing the glasses only had bubble wrap around 2 sides of the box. The glasses themselves are wrapped in one piece of tissue. Riedel wraps their glasses in foam wrap.My first shipment had one broken glass.My second shipment had one broken glass.Since broken glasses seem to be a common problem, Amazon should send replacement glasses rather than have customer send entire set of broken and unbroken glasses for refund or replacement.Customer service was great but this system is wasteful and inefficient. Besides there must be a lot of unrbroken glasses that have already been returned."
4,The show's over.,"Great deal was running with 6 burgs when you bought 6 bords. They got rid of that deal. Too bad if you didn't already buy them. They're a pretty good deal at 6 for $$$, they were a great deal at 12 for $$$. Nice glasses, almost as nice as my Reidels. It's worth having one or the other if you don't already have quality stemware."
2,Spiegelau May not ship for weeks/months,This deal has been running since September and I know people who have been told they may not get glasses until April of next year. Mine's been pushed back from early Oct. to mid Nov. I'm hanging on since I don't have an immediate need for the glasses but I still like a bargain.Some people now are reporting that their orders are being cancelled because the items are unavailable. Not true because these glasses can be bought almost anywhere. I guess it's easy to discount something you don't intend to sell.Glasses showed up with one broken. The packaging they use for glassware is completely inadequate. There is padding on all sides BUT the bottom.This review applied only to the buy 6 and get 6 more free. The current [price] for 6 glasses can be beat at many places.
3,broken glasses,"I ordered about 8 different sets of these glasses for Christmas presents and 90 percent of the orders arrived with a glass or two broken and then it is that receiver of the gifts responsiblity to return them all to get credit and a restocking fee and then wait for the next broken set to arrive. I have ordered 4 sets for myself and received 3 different broken glasses. So they are not great for a successful gift giving project, but are the very best for wine drinking."
2,"The glasses were ok ... but our package only had 5 glasses, not 6","The glasses were ok, but not great, for Bordeaux and other red wines. Additionally, only 5 glasses arrived in our box (which was intended to be a set of 6). Merchant refused to respond to requests to send the 6th glass--or provide a pro-rata refund for the missing glass--so we sent all 5 of them back. Oh well."
5,The Best for Less,"Why spend more on ""that other manufacture's"" glasses. These glasses are equal or better in quality to the Riedel machine blown glasses at about half the price. I love a good glass of wine, and now good wine glasses. I discovered Spiegelau approx. one year ago. They were recommended by the Sommelier at the Biltmore Estates Winery as the best value in quality stemware. Do yourself a favor, and pour a ""big"" Cab or Cab blend into one of these glasses and taste the wine like it was meant to be tasted. My other Spiegelau glasses (a different line) were very good, these are great. If you don't beleave me, ask people in the wine industry. That's what I did."
4,Excellent stemware but beware of the shipping method,"I ordered a combination package of 6 Bordeaux and 6 Burgundy Spiegelau wine glasses. Although all 6 Burgundy glasses arrived safely, only 3 of the Bordeaux glasses arrived in tact. I must admit I am surprised that not all of the glasses are broken when you consider how Amazon shipped these. They arrived in the original mfgr's box with nothing more than tissue paper wrapped around the glasses. No packing material was used. I'd still recommend the purchase although it's not clear to me how long it will take before I have all 12 glasses to enjoy."
3,"Broken glass, broken heart!",I ordered the 6 Burgandy glasses with the Bordeux bonus-Great Christmas gift. Unfortunatly the original box was placed in a larger box with bubble wrap around the sides and top-not the bottom. I received one broken glass in each box!
5,Memoirs of a Dutch Mudsill,"This book will be of great interest to any Civil War historian looking to experience the duration of the war through the eyes of a fighting man. I have read hundreds of original and transcribed letters and diaries from soldiers that participated in the Civil War. This is, by far, the best written and complete transcription of a collection of memoirs that I have found. Because my great-great grandfather fought in the same unit as John Henry Otto, the story told within this book holds a very special meaning to me. I am blessed to be able to know my grandfather's story by hearing it through the writings and recollections of John Henry Otto. I am forever grateful to the editors for this magnificent undertaking. It will be treasured by my family for generations."
1,Don't bother unless....,"Don't bother getting this unless you already own everything else! It's good to see everyone's setup, but SeeMoreBuds doesn't show you much. This movie is more for an entertaining view, than to be an informative guide from which to learn. SeeMoreBuds does NOT show you details regarding PH, PPM, nutrient usage, equipment requirements, etc... If you seek knowledge, learn from a pro:High Times Growers Series: Jorge Cervantes' Ultimate Grow DVD"
2,NOT WORTH IT!,I dunno if the other reviews on here are astroturfing or what but this video sucks! It has some pretty pictures but doesn't tell you how to set anything up. It just provides a few general tips that you could find on any online forum in a couple minutes. Save your money.
4,Pay attention to the video,"I think it's funny how people say that the video doesn't give a detailed breakdown of his crops. You are either blind or stupid. He tells you what he's doing and how he set it up. He tells you the PH, PPM,watts per square foot and so on. You may have seen the video, but you obviously weren't watching. Take notes."
2,sweet silliness,"i picked up this book during finals, just to have something light to read. this type of book isn't my usual pick and although it did have some cute moments, at the end i felt it was a giant waste of time. it's a book if you just want to pass time without really caring what you read, but it is definitely not the type of book you come away from having learned something or having made you think ""outside the box."""
4,"An interesting read, but not too realistic","This book is very entertaining to look through, and if you happen to be crossing paths with any of the places it visits it can be useful. But few people have the time to actually do what this book describes--travel a good part of the country on (what at least used to be) one of America's two-lane roads.If you're planning a trip that overlaps one of this book's covered routes, then it's worth the money. But if your trip is primarily to get from point A to point B, try, for example, Let's Go USA."
3,OK minor reference,The USA is just too big to encompass in one book. Most things covered in this book can be found by searching the internet. Good reference.
4,SOME COMMENTS ON BOOK ROAD TRIP USA,This is a good book that can help any traveler in USA to plan a many trips in many routes across the country. I highly
2,SLOW DOWN and smell the coffee!,"Road Trip - USA returns you a time when America was much, much slower paced. I purchased this book because I am interested in motorcycling some of these roads in the near future. Preferable, U.S.-50. A well written book that touches on the main points of interest across, and up and down America.I am looking forward to traveling some of these roads."
5,Remembrance: it gave me peace and joy,"I might not have had the opportunity to buy this CD so soon after its release had not my son recommended it to me. He had known the composer when she lived in Germany and knew that I love American Musicals. I was emotionally entranced by the variety of the selections, and by the artistry of the performers. Victoria Grof most certainly deserves to take her place among those who have graced the Broadway stages. I look forward to other releases by Miss Grof and her two gifted young singers, Priscilla Mathis and Dwight Braswell, certainly names to watch for in the future."
4,with the owl and the pussycat ...,"Surrealism arrived in America in 1932, hardly a minute too late. According to Tashjian, it fled from Europe in the midst of the Depression and the rise of Nazism and Fascism.During the war the amazing efforts of Varian Fry's Emergency Rescue Committee enabled a number of the principle figures to slip away from the Nazi net.Tashjian's story accounts for the amazing transformation of American fine art and popular culture under the influence of these European emigres, ending with the beginning of McCarthyism, under which regime most of them, being left-of-centre, rowed back to Europe. Perhaps Dali remained and reigned supreme.The hardcover book has plenty of photographs, unfortunately all in black and white, and a slightly whacky presentation that makes it a fun read. It's academically researched with extensive endnotes and extremely informative. Highly recommended and now available in paperback."
5,Terrific reading,My oldest daughter loves this book. The entire series by Esther Averill is terrific!
4,A must-read,"This is a rare work of art in the modern American church: it's honest. It's a must-read for anyone entering the ministry and who seeks to live in true holiness. Holiness doesn't present itself as holy. It just is holy. It doesn't draw attention to itself. This work shows us the shame of trying to live an image of holiness instead of being holy. How to deal with our superficial faith. It's a work about God saying 'no' instead of being a short order cook always supplying us with what we consider to be the best of everything. Obviously, it's sobering. It's also enjoyable and hardly as critical or mean as this review sounds. Although there's alot of music industry info, the plot itself is compelling and the ending is rewarding and packs quite a twist! Happy reading, all."
4,in Christ name?,"This book takes a hard look at the music industry flying under the Christian flag. It shows a young man's struggle to keep his Christianity as he slowly watches it slide between his fingers, as everybody around him tells him it's ""o.k."" I enjoyed this book throughly, espcially from the marketing standpoint. It's very authentic and real to the struggles in trying to keep your trueself while everything around you is fabricated. A good read for anyone who questions where their spiritual gifts lie and how they should use them. I felt like I lost a good friend when I finished this book."
1,Dissatisfied !!!!!!,"If you want to pay more for shipping charges,....than the product your purchasing is worth ???? than shop at Adorama Camera....I ordered a Camera Case for my Kodak V-1000 Camera $16.99 plus $7.99 Shipping charges ...........I than looked at similar Case's at Walmart , and found one for $6.99.....Go figure......... NO THANK YOU !!! I was suckered once, Never Again !!!"
1,disappointed,"I purchased this Cd from mscene44, James Butteri, when I played the CD, the music did not sound original. I tried to mail it back for my refund and this James Butteri refused to accept my postal package.I guess I am stuck with this CD, and I am unable to get my refund back from this guy. Beware buying from this guy. You will be disappointed and you will lose your money."
2,lacks luster,"Hemingway would have been better served by including more narratives than the ramblings of his characters. He seems to believe that it is important to capture what they actually said since they are real characters and not imaginary, but how realistic is that? Obviously, he couldn't write while hunting so undoubtedly he paraphrased their conversations when he was able to write - possibly days or weeks later. So if he's going to paraphrase then he should polish up the dialogue. And, perhaps exclude much of the pointless dribble. Some of which might not have been pointless if he had done a better job of developing the characters.I do not recommend this book. Instead, I would rather point a potential reader of African safari stories to the works of Peter Capstick."
4,A Romp Thru Imperial Africa,"Hemingway takes a trek through an Africa still largely ruled by ""burdoned"" white men. He tries to explain why assaulting the native creatures of the dark continent is acceptable (he ate what he killed after all!) But the most intriguing parts of ""Green Hills"" were not stalking wildlife through tall grass. Rather, Hemingway's most poignant recollections lie in describing the interpersonal relations, the ups and downs, between American and European hunters.Throughout the entire quest for game, Papa stresses that time is limited by an impending rainy season as well as available funds. He goes on then to remark that hunters are not the only people whose life plans are upset by capitalism. He points out that artists and writers also fall victim to a world whose interpersonal works ravage most of us."
2,Sadly dated but hunters will love it,"Hemingway is, of course, a great writer; therefore, in choosing to read this non-fiction account of his sojourns in Africa, I was expecting real insights into the country. I found myself sickened by his delight in killing the wild animals. Anyone who has been there and prefers 'shooting' from behind the camera will be as repulsed as I was. I realize that I am guilty of ""presentism"", viewing something from the lens of the present rather than of those from the time period in which it was written. Even so, I was expecting insights such as a great journalist such as Ryszard Kapusckinski provides. I found it very difficult to finish. Rather than Hemingway, I suggest The Shadow of the Sun by Kapusckinski."
3,Blah,"Written in descriptive prose of the African countryside, this book is simply a month of safari hunting in Africa, with little drama and no real end."
3,For hunters only,"I am a huge fan of Hemingway. For whom the bell tolls is among my favorite books ever. But this one just didn't come close to Hemingway's greatest books. The green hills of Africa is a book about hunting. A team of hunters go to Africa to hunt kudu. And we follow in the teams tracks as they search for prey. It manages to capture the reader's interest, but unless you are a hunter yourself, it will not be a great book. There is not enough going on. But the book isn't bad, it's a good book. Just not one worthy of Hemingway. If your're a huge fan of him, read it, but if your're not don't! Read for whom the bell tolls instead, if you haven't already."
1,Read Ruark Instead,"Like trying to pull teeth with tweezers. The only reason I finished this book is because I paid money for it. Had I been on this safari I would have used them all for lion bait. Boring people way out of their element. If you want an entertaining account of a real safari, read ""Horn Of The Hunter"" by Robert Ruark. This book is a real snooze fest, avoid it."
3,Hemingway's writing,I found this writing less interesting than Rossevelt or Rourk work purchased at the same time. Perhaps the critics opinions are not always the best way to judge a work.
5,Hemingway lets it all hang out,"This is the first Hemingway I read and it remains the best. People who think Hemingway only writes in short sentences haven't read ""Green Hills of Africa."" He uses the longest sentences he can use and there isn't a paragraph in the whole book that isn't magical. After this I read ""For Whom the Bell Tolls,"" a big disappointment, the prose bored me half to death, except for one absolutely brilliant section: the brutal execution of the village fascists by the village commies, as told in flashback by 'the mujer of Pablo.' Then I tried ""the Sun Also Rises"" which put me to sleep; couldn't finish it, eventhough a third grader could read it. So skip those two ""classics"" and read ""Green Hills,"" if you want great prose and then start on ""African Stories"" by Doris Lessing if you don't mind being blown away."
3,Easy Read,"Hemingway's terse but descriptive style is intriguing and provocative as usual, but something is here. The book appears to be nothing more than a journal, and in this case looks are not decieving. This is merely an account of a hunting binge in Africa that captivates the reader but leaves him with virtually nothing to take away. It wouldn't be nearly as successful if it didnt tote the name of America's literature leviathan. All in all, its a quick, easy, fun read."
4,Surprisingly good,"I am a big Hemingway fan, but I did not expect much from this book. After all, Hemingway himself described it as an ""experiment"". However, the Green Hills of Africa turned out to be a surprisingly good read. Hemingway's description of the landscape, the people and the whole safari is excellent. He could, however made the description of the hunting itself a bit more exciting. His account of the hidden jealousies within the safari is especially interesting, and the passage(just a long sentence actually)about the Gulf Stream is simply amazing. I highly recommend this book."
3,A unique look at African big game hunting in the 1930's,"In this detailed account of Hemingway's first African safari, one gains a strong sense of the emotions of big game hunting, as well as a familiarity with the practical details that made it such a challenge. The narrative features the same precise, yet economical descriptions that characterize his works of fiction. The dialog, however, often appears rather contrived, with the appearance of trying to create an image that may not be the unvarnished truth. Elspeth Huxley's mystery novel Murder on Safari provides similar, detailed information in a form that I, not a hunter, found more readable."
1,Drunkards despoil Africa.,"It is hard to believe that he who wrote FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS wrote this. I am not an animal rights advocate but one cannot help but root for the animals as Ernest and his cronies blast away at them with high powered rifles. If only that buffalo could have backtracked on them.... And the racist, sexist, and even agist musings are disgusting. Drunkards stagger across Africa killing animals, cutting the heads and horns off, and leaving them to rot . Revolting."
1,"Nice idea, but...",No complaints with odering and shipping...but the product itself was poorly produced. Quality of recording is as bad as it gets.
4,it is fun to play a dog,one thing you might have trouble with is the dog catcher but other then that is that you get to play as a dog
5,One of the funnest games to play!,"If you totally love dogs and video games, this is your dream game! Be a dog in the game. Play as Jake. Dig, play with a cute rubber ball, shake cats, chase chickens, bark all you want!, run from the dog catcher,swim and so much more! Dog's life is so worth your money!"
2,Could be longer,Bought game for grandson because he saw demo in store. I should have rented the game before I bought it for him. He enjoyed the game 100%. He defeated the game to the end by day 3. He loves games and has a natural knack for playing them. I forgot to look and see if it had enough memory to be worth the buy. Boys like farting and stinky things and he commented to me that I would not like that part but it made him laugh often.
5,Doggone Fun,"I think this game will be a hit i love dogs so im getting it as soon as it comes out!! i'v done ALOT of research on the game so i know tons about it( i even got cheats!!) when i found out that it wasnt coming out 'till Aug. 24 i was fourious all my reasearch would get runied( i have 4 dogs who eat everything and 2 brothers who destroy everything!)but at amazon i can by it now and get it when its in stock i get to play within a few days!!!!! yahoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and its only 20 bucks so i can get it quick.i love the fact that there is free roaming so you can pretty much do what ever you want, the only game that i have that is like that is kingdom hearts and theres still alot of places off-limits. I CANT WAIT 'TILL IT COMES OUT!!!!"
1,Don't Buy This!,"Although it seems fun, it really is a very boring game. Besides the awful graphics, the pooping and peeing? Really, is that necessary? In the game, the whole point is to find all of the scents(BORING!)and collect all the bones(YAWN)it really has no point to it at all. For the 20.00 I spent my birthday money on this for, it is definitely not worth it. Oh, and about the teen rating, it is for crude humor, and it was a very good reason to put that rating on. Some of the things on here are VERY inappropriate! Don't buy this for your kids!"
3,Dog's life,"Dog's Life is a game for animal lovers, no doubt. the gaphics are so-so and the humour is cringy, but apart from that it's a pretty good game. the teen rating is totally wrong, and this game is great 4 kids, apart from the cringy jokes.The dog is cute enough (not as cute as my dog) but the people look like torn out pieces of cardboard of a cornflake box. easy gameplay (took me a day 2 complete) and is chalenging for younger gamers i suppose. I think the teen rating is only because of the dog can pee and poo and fart (eww gross)overall though a cute, decent game suitable for under 13 year olds I'd say."
4,Great!!!!,"This game is the best game I have ever had! Don't worry about the Teen rating. Its very fun. The only problem is, you can't pick what dog you can be. When the game starts, you just end up controling that Jake dog. The other thing that I'm annoyed at, is that my 6 year old sister wants to play badly. Why can't this game be for 2 players so that I can verse my sister at mini games?! Howerver, the game is still is very fun."
3,dog,this was fun for a bit untill you have to battle dogs its stupid how you baddle dogs you should race insted of doing a memory mach game.
2,Heavy weight?,"I was mislead by the advertisement. The shorts are skin thin and don't have pockets in them. Quality it is ok for what they really are ... pijama shorts.Maybe it is my problem 'cause I am not a native English language speaker, maybe not."
3,RUSSELL ATHLETIC Heavy Weight Plaited Jersey Short,"Very nice shorts, excellent for working out. However, they wore off too quickly!"
5,Very good - Just what the doctor ordered,"I am an accountant and work on the road with my laptop most of the time. But data entry without a numeric keypad has been a real drag. The Kensington keypad design is awesome because it kills two birds with one stone. It combines its original purpose as a numeric keypad for notebook computers with an external calculator. Also, given that my notebook only has two USB ports, two extra USB ports on the keypad is a godsend. The only complaint (albeit a very minor one) is that the keypad goes to sleep after a short while which is a minor annoyance. And you do have to remember to toggle it back to keypad entry after you use it as a calculator. I highly recommend this product."
2,This thing falls asleep quicker than my grandpa in a recliner,"The other Kensington 10-Key I owned worked great, this model is always in sleep mode. It works great, but I have to remember to wake it up everytime I want to use it, and I use it every 3 minutes or less, I'm an accountant.However I do recommend the Kensington 19-Key External Pocket Keypad and Calculator (33059)Kensington 19-Key External Pocket Keypad and Calculator (33059)it works great!"
3,Works... but a little disappointing.,"The product works OK; however, it does have a few minor annoying flaws. I have to turn the unit on to get it to work with my iMac. The keys are smallish and it doesn't feel robust. I would recommend this to a heavy number-cruncher who wants to use it with a laptop on the go. My purpose for buying was because the tiny Mac keyboard had no numeric keypad... plus it doesn't have enough USB ports."
1,Warning for number crunchers! Don't be fooled!,"Warning! This is not a standard size keypad! I am a CPA that uses calculators and keypads by touch, without looking at each keystroke. This keypad has been reduced from ""normal"" size. It requires you to squeeze your fingers together and shift your hand position for keystrokes by different fingers. Unless you have a very small hand and small fingers, expect a lot of keystroke errors and slow entry. For years I have used a Targus PAUK001 keypad that looks almost identical to the Kensington photo. The Targus model was full sized but is no longer available. The picture fooled me into buying the Kensington.Thank goodness for easy returns with Amazon. However, it would have been nice to avoid the hassle althogether with a better description and specifications (size measurements) of the keypad."
4,LCD Panel Only In Calculator Mode,"It works well for most people.I actually ordered several of these for the LCD panel to use as a sort of PIN pad. However, I ended up returning all that I ordered, because the LCD panel only works in calculator mode. Most people probably don't need more than that; but if you do, don't buy this one. I couldn't find this information on the item description here or at the manufacturer's web site; however, a call to the manufacturer confirmed this."
2,not user friendly,No instructions and this device is not user friendly at all. would not recommend due to no instructions and when you call the response is poor
2,"Great Idea, but...","I was excited to find a Keypad/Calculator that could help me with my laptop, being as my number keys are all above the letters. It was a bit cumbersome switching back and forth, though. Secondly, if you network into an office, via the internet, don't expect this to work. I do numbers all day long and when I needed the keypad to work the most, it would not respond via network. I wish I had bought the single product, with no calculator feature. The cheaper keypad works perfectly networking into a home office!"
5,Best One Yet,"I have used the cordless version of this keypad for two years. When I moved offices and was closer to someone else that was also using a wireless keypad, our signals would get mixed up and all sorts of mayhem took place in the office. Cursors went everywhere, random numbers appearing, invalid entries in accounting fields... you name it. This version is even better because it doubles as a USB pass through. Love it.I have used other corded keypads as well, and they usually have larger buttons. You would think that larger buttons would mean less errors, but I have found the opposite to be true. These smaller buttons are just the right size."
3,Good Keypad but not great.,Its a good number keypad but not great. Some keys functions are not understandable. Manual is not there to explain the special keys. Also when in NUM LOCK Mode the LCD screen does not show the pressed number keys or does not echo the pressed keys on the LCD screen. This is important because when we are pressing the number keys our eyes are on the keypad and not on the computer screen so its should show what number sequence we have typed.Over all it works but the special key functions are poorly designed or its functionality is not designed properly.I will give it a 3 - STAR or a bit less RATING. But I could not find any other Laptop Keypad better than this either so far. Being a Multifunction key pad is certainly a good feature.
2,A difficult read,"This book was a difficult read. It was like wanting to stare at a car accident...No matter how depressing this was and how I disliked Jon more and more I had to finish reading it, though at times was tempted to just give up.The writting is chaotic and Jon is so un-likable there was nothing in this book that I could feel for...."
3,The most depressing book ive ever read,This movie really shows the downside of drugs.....its such a shame that a man as good looking as he was fell so far and could not keep himself clean....this book is so depressing and there is nothing at all uplifting about it......its a great book for someone to read that needs a jolt back to reality and off of drugs......this shows just what its like to be an addict
2,Depressing,"I read the book from cover to cover. It's really a depressing book. I always had the hots for this man. I think he was a talent and very good looking man. I've been depress this past year. My lover didn't want me, He used me. I was used by my friends. I had no one to turn too. I have to take care of my sick mother. But I know Drugs is not the answer. When I was growing up I was treated like dog doo. I had nothing! I was offer many times drugs when I was young, But I had my self respect not touching them. My grandfather had a say, The differents between an animal and a human is, A human has a brainto think first!"
1,A tale of depravation and sickness!!,"I am not sure just how I managed to wade through this sorry account of the worst of the human experiences. I can't understand just why anyone would chronicle these events, or make any positive comments about such a complete failure of a poor human being.. This person sunk to every kind of perversion and should only be looked at as an example of almost every depraved activity. Save your money! It really soesn't deserve even one star."
4,Exactly what I needed,It is exactly what I needed - had collages printed from snapfish.com which are 11x14 so they fit perfectly in this book.
4,"Oh, that song",This movie starts with such a classic song. The movie is one of my more favorite John Wayne movies. Classic stuff.
3,Typical John Wayne,John Wayne had a knack for making movies that were just fun to watch. This is one of them.
2,Disappointed,"I bought the DVD based on all the positive reviews, and I think prospective buyers should be warned that not everyone finds this a 5-star movie. My husband and I, who love old movies, hated it. My teenagers just found it completely uninteresting. It was apparently made about the time Alaska became a state, although it deals with an earlier time period, and the movie has not aged well. The story was uninteresting, the direction was uneven, the comedy (mostly bar fights) felt forced and awkward. Stewart Granger did not seem to know what he was doing or why his character was there. Fabian's acting was unmemorable and we felt Capucine was miscast. We got bored and spent half the movie pointing out to each other how little the sandy beaches and desert terrain looked anything like Alaska (it was obviously shot in southern California). I gave it two stars because I was able to sit through the entire thing, but I spent most of it asking myself ""why? Why am I wasting my time like this?"""
5,Big Duke Fan,I am a big fan of John Wayne westerns. This is a fun movie to watch with the family. Found it here at a great price. Package arrived on time and in great condition. Thanks
4,Makes me laugh...,"This was a great movie. While not my favorite John Wayne movie, it is still a good one! I always laugh at the scenes where his character is getting jealous about his friend being with Angel. Nobody does it like John Wayne. Love the song too!"
5,"Wayne at his best, a fun movie.","Great male/female dialogue,funny. Beautiful scenery. Timeless story. One of Wayne's best."
4,"Gold, Humor, and the Duke - what could be better","North to Alaska is not a typical John Wayne Western - it is actually more of a comedy than anything else. The main theme of North to Alaska is the Gold Rush, but it focuses more on the love story between the Duke and leading actress than anything else. As much I as enjoy action in John Wayne movies, I really appreciated the humor in this film. It has several entertaining bar fight scenes, and other scenes which break into general mayhem.If you are looking for a film which is just plain fun to watch - this is one of them."
3,East o' the Sun West o' the Moon,"I believe that this is the only retelling of ""East of the Sun West of the Moon"" that there is on film. It is done very well for most of it, but part of the lure of the fairy tale is that the White Bear cannot tell anything to his love. Her curiosity about him leads to his being taken and her journey is one of penance. She along has to figure out what to do, with the help of the West Wind and others. The movie makes everything too plain and tidy. Ah well, the acting isn't bad and the Polar Bear, from Jim Henson's Creature Shop is pretty neat."
4,Delightful,I stumbled on this movie while switching channels one Sunday evening. I love a good fairy tale and this fit the bill. I thought the costume design and set were beautifully done and the story was told well. It was a delightful movie and I enjoyed it a great deal. I'm thinking this is a show that I might have to get my niece for Christmas.
5,Great quality.,This movie is of really good quality. The storyline is great and easy to follow along with. A must reccomend.
2,Not So Good,I have to say that despite the movie cover this is quite a low budget movie. As a result it is filled with cheesy acting and horrible scenery and costumes. It is based on Norweigen folklore and the basic story is similar to that of the Beauty and the Beast tales we all know. I love the storyline but cannot stand to watch the movie. This is the type of film where you can fast forward though it and still understand what it is about. I would not recommend this movie to anyone over the age of six. I apologize if this review offends anyone who loved the movie as a child but I see this film as a complete waste of time and money.
4,An old Norse fairy tale remade,"We first found this video in the video section of our local library. My entire family enjoyed it. It is based on an old Norse legend entitled ""East o' the Sun, West o' the Moon."" I was told the story by my Norwegian aunt when I was a child and have a bound copy of it that I read to my two children on a regular basis. The video isn't quite true to the tale but what adaptation is? It does a more than creditable job of telling the story. It has all the things that make a fairy tale great--a beautiful princess, a handsome prince under a terrible curse, an evil witch. The soundtrack is a little choppy but the photography is quite lovely and very well done for an obscure little Scandinavian film. My, at the time five years old, daughter found the story easy to follow and adored it. I found it to be a wholesome enjoyable treat fit for viewing by the entire family."
4,A little gem,"This movie is captivating from its frosty beginnings to its very happy ending. It is Beauty and the Beast movie. The Beauty is the youngest daughter of the snowy Winterland. She is down to earth one, as all female heros are. Against the wishes of her father and the community she falls in love with a Polar Bear who is a charmed Summerland Prince and goes with him to his homeland, becomes his bride and bears three children. But, lurking in the background is the wicked witch who wants the prince for herself. The Prince's mother is also in the background keeping an eye on the grandchildren and the young couple. The cinematography and costuming are beautiful, really rounding out the storyline. The one negative is the wolves . They are actually Huskies. But children won't know the difference and they won't care."
3,Different sort of movie,"This is a fairy tale of the king of the summer land who's been changed into a polar bear and must be rescued by the youngest princess of the winter land. It's not a usual Hollywood production, which can be seen by the acting, script, and credits. While it is likely too scarey for preschoolers and too slow-moving for older children, once you've watched this movie for awhile, its melancholy tone seems to put a spell on you and you can't stop watching it.It's a fairy tale in the classic sense, by which I mean the narrator could be reading from a version written by the Brothers Grimm or Anderson, judging from the style and non-sanitized content.It's clean. I don't recall any profanity or immodesty. (I don't consider the brief glimpse of the princess breastfeeding her child to be inappropriate.)"
5,Good Family Movie,This is an excellent family movie; it's pure fantasy. The story is well done; and is sure to be a favorite.
2,Not exactly the best,"It was kinda boring ,but there were a FEW scenes that were actually interesting."
1,"Expectations were low, but wow -- really bottom of the barrel","We rented this movie with expectations for a low budget film, but even those expectations were shattered within the first five minutes by the absolutely poor quality. Once the prince got transformed and went ""Raaar"", we couldn't keep watching. Maybe production was started with good intentions, and the plotline has potential as far as we could tell from the back cover, but if I could give this no stars I would."
3,Intriguing and sensual,"Flesh's new book concerns Stephen, a man who may or may not be dying of AIDS, who is mourning the loss of his lover Robert who died 3 years ago. Stephen is visited by a group of cultists, where he experiences a sort of awakening. The end of the world is coming and he is not prepared. Stephen then begins an inner journey in the world where he finds God's true nature as well as his own. Flesh's style is potent and beautiful, and I found the book quite mesmerizing, and yet certain sections seemed to need more fleshing out. As perfectly as I could visualize this story as a movie, I never entirely connected to Stephen as a person."
4,A 20th century Cosi,There are lots of little things wrong with this production. But the main thing is that it works - and it works powerfully. This is not a happy Cosi - at the end the principles are still falling apart. And when you think of it well they should be. Their lives have been terribly shaken by love which is in truth the most powerful force there is.By updating the time to present day America the sexuality implicit in the story is brought to the fore. Sellars also plays with the story - not just at the end when who goes with whom is still up in the air - but in Act 1 when the turks attempt to pair with their former loves. Then in Act 2 when the women pick their men - the opposite of their loves - the men are taken off guard and wounded. Thus starts the downward plunge of this Cosi into pain. The singing-acting is great. This is not the ideal Mozart singing. But if you want a Cosi that makes you think and feel this is it.
2,Car Go Cards: Fabulously Foolproof On-the-Road Activities for Kids,"I purchased these cards for a family trip over spring break, and while I like the packaging and format, I found the cards a disapointment. The games were not detailed enough- too vauge."
2,"my rating refers to the DVD, not the actual film","The first film ever made in cinemascope deserves much much more than the shoddy treament it's been given here. Regardless of what you think of the movie, and it has dated in places, the technical achievement needs to be admired, and that simply cannot happen with this release. Though there is an attempt to enhance the brightness, contrast and vivid color, the image is not crisp, and is nowhere near clean. In places there are snow storms of dust and scratches. The film is clearly warped in places and no attempt has been made to rectify the pitch changes in the soundtrack. Together with few extras and a cheap looking cover this is the sort of miserly release I'd expect from Paramount, not Fox.This films deserves the full restoration treatment."
4,Inspiring,"It's a good movie and inspiring in its message, because the message of the cross is true. Seeing the way the Christians stood up for their faith is certainly thought-provoking. There is a little romance in the story, which is nice. There was one thing in the beginning that wasn't good (women skantily clothed), but most of it was very good. We have watched it a lot of times; once with a Bible study group, which enjoyed it. Even if you aren't a Christian, the story is interesting and will probably keep your attention. I have read the book, and I like the movie better!"
5,The Robe DVD,"We remember this movie, ""The Robe"", and we enjoyed it this time around just as much. Would recommend this movie"
2,wont hold up over time.,"You pretty much have to be a Christian to enjoy this movie. Its more a propaganda piece than a historical drama. All the allusions to the greatness of Christ gets to be chore and a bore. This large scale production lacks much artistic and historic sensibilities (still see it in today's movies) as well. Outcome: cheese.If you wish to watch something Roman oriented avoid this. And if it Christian/biblical theme you want there are plenty of other movies that are better out there.The highlights of the film are the direction, the acting is adequate and the writing is well, insulting if you know anything about ancient Rome. In 40 years this movie wont be remembered like ""Quo Vadis"" will."
1,"Beautiful restoration, tedious movie","The restoration is beautiful. The images are clear, the color breathtaking. The sound track is solid with some dimensionality though the bass is weak. However the movie itself does not hold up -- it is ponderous, tedious and lacks in dramatic tension. Some of the acting seems very wooden."
1,"if you've read the book, don't buy the movie","My son and I finished reading the book, The Robe, and thought the movie would be interesting to watch. It was a tremendous disappointment - the story vastly diverges from the book, with some very strange additions and deletions. The book is such a good story, but the movie's plot is poorly constructed, the characters poorly developed and often not in keeping with the original character. It really makes me wonder why the movie makers chose to make something so poor, when the book was so good. And certainly DON'T buy the second movie, Demetrius, the Gladiator. The fine slave, Demetrius, is not recognizable at all in this arrogant, pleasure-loving, fighting machine and the ending is really weird. Together, the 2 movies were definitely a waste of our money."
5,Stands out among the plethora of biblical movies,"This is the film that has the distinction of being the very first to be presented in Cinemascope. There were a plethora of biblical films made during the fifties and sixties; this one turned out to be one of the better ones. Just like the others, this film is chock-full of corny overacting by its top stars, but most of the time, you can get away with it in a biblical film. Victor Mature, fresh from his lead in Cecile B. DeMille's ""Samson and Delilah"", is presented in a supporting role as Demetrius the Greek Slave. A sequel to ""The Robe"", titled ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"", came along a few years later and started just where ""The Robe"" ended. Mature participates in that film in a much more prominent role."
1,What is this?,"Is this really The Robe? This movie strays so far from the novel that I would barely be able to guess it was based upon it if it weren't for using some of the same character names. THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY!!!From the very first scene, the movie had strayed from the story. I watched 45 minutes of the 135 minutes and couldn't bear to see anymore. THE WHOLE STORY HAS BEEN ALTERED OR REMOVED!!!The movie might be okay for someone who hasn't read the book, but the acting isn't that great either.I would really like to see a modern filming of The Robe that at least attempts to follow the novel."
1,The Robe,Not one of the best Biblical pictures that I have seen thus far. Not really much of a decent storyline. The acting was not up to par and could have had better dramtics than was shown in the movie. However what can you expect with a picture after seeing dramatic special effects these days.
1,The Robe,This product arrived faulty and I have not been able to contact Amazon to make a complaint. I will not buy from Amazon again until this matter has been addressed satisfactorily.I cannot review what cannot be watched due to glitches in the DVD.\
2,Movie good! New restored transfer no!,Not worth double dipping if you have the old dvd.This new transfer has a lot of blurry color scenes.Stick with the old copy at least the movie doesn't change in color.
2,Interesting concept - poor presentation,"I cannot be the only baby boomer who enjoys this film annually - more because of nostalgia than presentation. The concept - the effect of Jesus on the least expected! - is quite intriguing. However, the script is uneven, the acting below par, and the connections between one event and another very contrived. The annoying 1950s-60s staple of a ""faceless"" Jesus is more trying every year! For believing Christians, there is little here in the way of ""inspiration"" - despite one moving segment involving the apostle Peter (admitting to his weakness and denials) and a young woman who was cured by Jesus, not of her enduring physical illness, but of an attitude that crippled her the more. Though the Robe's odd attributes seem more the Roman's subconscious outcry (or something!), it smacks of making Jesus rather a spiteful magician. Still, it is an enjoyable afternoon of viewing."
4,"One of the Great ""Bad Biblical Epics""","20th Century Fox pulled out all the stops for their first Cinemascope picture and you can certainly see every penny on the screen. It is, however, far from Richard Burton's best performance as he frequently wallows in more than a little scenery chewing, especially at those moments of great religious revelation. The better performances are in the secondary characters such as Michael Rennie as Peter (who underplays the role very nicely) and Jay Robinson as Caligula (who overplays his part with all the gusto it deserves).This is neither great film-making nor great religion, but there are moments that raise it to the pinnacle of the ""so bad it's good"" genre and for that, it's worth watching."
2,A pretentious dud.,"Good actors were wasted in an extraordinarily unconvincing story. The sight of Richard Burton dueling like Errol Flynn in ""Robin Hood"" was absurd."
4,A Classic Film - excellent reproduction.,"This Classic Film depicting the impact of what early Christianity had on certain people, and especially certain Roman leaders of the time. The ROBE was the Robe/Garment worn by Jesus on his way to Crucifixion. Richard Burton and Jean Simmons lead a dramatic cast - this is a 1953-54 film that will remain a great classic, and its DVD reproduction is very well copied."
3,Poor Transfer Quality,The first movie filmed in Cinemascope deserves better treatment than this transfer to DVD. The source material is full of defects either from age or FOX just pulled any old copy off the shelf. Colors look washed and many black specks appear on screen. Picture is soo poor looks like a public domain copy of the movie. Shame on you FOX for not treating the film and subject matter with reverence.Story deserves better treatment too. Fictional account of man finding Jesus is actually a very good story. Richard Burton at age 28!
3,Great Film but disappointing picture quality for a DVD,"I believe this movie will always stand as one of the great old time Hollywood epics and Biblical classic. However, to my disappointment, the actual picture quality usually expected from a restored DVD presentation is not very good. The picture is very grainy with many white spots from dirt and scratches. I would expect this from an old VHS version but not from a DVD restoration. Yet the film itself is great one so if not having a perfectly clean and crisp presentation doesn't bother you, this is a must have. If not, I would wait until Fox decides to do a better job in the transfer process."
4,Classic,If you are into classic movies like I am then this one is a must. You just don't see movies like this anymore. A good family movie too.
5,The Robe,"We had not seen The Robe for a long time and ordered a DVD so we could watch it. It came in good condition and we were quite moved by it. There were some actors in it who have been gone for a long time, but they were superb in this movie."
5,The Robe CD,"Love the movie, arrived fast, very good shipper, satisfied with the way it was sent and how quickly it got here."
5,Classic,"The book is much better, of course, but the old movie sets and the legendary actors in this film are amazing. The quality was very good and the costumes are beautifully made. If you always wondered what happened to Jesus' robe after they crucified Him, see this film."
2,Compared to the Book it really lacks...,Well after reading the Book this movie only possibly followed the ending. its really sad too because the book is so fabulous. My teenager and I both read the Robe...and we both were totally engrossed in the book. Rented the movie and we were so disgusted! The only people who could really watch it were my daughters who did not read the book. So I guess if you want to be entertained and you can get past the biblical inaccuracy of the way they portray Peter. (I mean who doesnt know the recordings in the Gospels of his denial??) then you may like it. Id say though if you really want a good story get the book!
2,very disapointed,"first of all if i had watched this when i first purchased i would have returned it due to the terrible quality of the Blu-ray both in picture and sound. I had the same problem with another Blue-ray i purcased at the same time. I have seen this picture a few times but it never was like in this blu-ray. seems like a LOT of parts were cut out, so much left out. i think within the first 15min. jesus is already on the cross. this does not seem like it is the original version. very dissapointed in it and i will not keep it"
3,"better than average biblical epic, but far from heavenly","the religious epic -- a close cousin to the more action-oriented sword and sandal epic -- was a strange trend in cinema. Ponderous movies performed by actors who felt obliged to stare off meaningfully into the distance...and yet audiences ate them up. Heck, Richard Burton even got an Oscar nomination for this typical if slightly above average entry. No expense was spared (you don't want to nickle and dime Jesus, do you?) and the lavishness shows on this fine Blu Ray edition complete with an appreciation by Martin Scorsese, audio commentary, making-of features, a newsreel and more. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
4,The Robe,"VHS Tape was ok, it had been used more than I thought it would have been according to the seller but I was still satisfied with my purchase."
5,A very powerful and moving film!,I highly recommend this film. It is very moving and a beautiful film. I would give it ten stars if I could.
5,Best picture ever,"I've always loved this film and have had every version of it in Beta tape, VHS, Laser Disc, DVD and now BLU-RAY. I was expecting a little better picture but was blown away by it's richness. It took me back to the first time I saw this movie as a child of 9 sitting in the front row of the JUMBO theater in Philadelphia (1954) I believe, and the screen exploding in front of me for my first experience of glorious Cinemascope.BEAUTIFUL!"
5,Gift,I bought this and a few more movies for my mother who loved these old movies! Her vhs copies are worn out so it was time for a upgrade!
3,A Very Dramatic Movie,"The story was excellent, the sets and color great, nice clear picture quality.It has a great all star cast. But I was not prepared for the dramatic level of acting that was performed in those days. It was almost painful to watch the movie to the end. If you like that old school theatrical acting, you'll like this movie. I'm 51 and I remember the movies from my youth, but when you view them again after this many years you realize how much the style of acting and realm of directing has changed."
5,Inspiring!,"This movie brings back memories of when I was younger. This is one of my most favorite movies, any time of the year!"
3,Worth watching,I orderd this and a few others as gifts. The DVD works great. Love the story. Would recommend this to anyone.
5,Great book for the beginner and the experienced hunter.,This book is a question and answer book. The entire book is full questions about the whitetail deer. Leonard usually has data to support his answers to the questions in his book. He also gives other people credit when he uses an answer that he learned from their studies. This is a great book for either beginners or experienced hunters. I have been hunting for 14 years and I learned a lot of things from this book.
4,Kinnick The player from Nebraska who played for Iowa,This is a unique biography about the football player who won the Heisman Trophy from the Univeristy of Iowa. It also covers his family heritage and lots of little family stories.I wish the book would have had more info on the games (won/loss) record of his teams and possilbly more stories from his team players.....Good reading for a sports nut......
4,Minus one star for Amazon not stating risk of bad eggs!,"Really, this is still an awesome deal, and it was no surprise that there was a small catch. You should just know about it before you buy. You are sure to get one or more broken glasses in the delivery and I got one in three boxes so far. I do not know if this is a packaging failure or that they are known by Amazon to contain broken glasses before shipping. There were also two glasses with serious imperfections from poor quality control issues. But still at $2.50 a glass i am not complaining too much, just doing a service by printing my experiences. They are very good glasses overall if not broken or defective!"
5,"Great Glasses, Great Deal","I got the Burgundy set with the 'freebie' Bordeaux set and couldn't be happier. Both sets arrived without a scratch on them. I ordered the Chardonnay set about a year ago and those also arrived in perfect condition.The price:quality ratio of Spiegelau glasses is better than Riedel, even without the amazing discounts at Amazon.As far as dishwashing goes, they seem strong enough to withstand the gentle cycle. However, my old dishwasher has etched some of my everyday drinking glasses so I wouldn't dare put my treasured wine glasses in it. They're very easy to hand wash with very hot water, which is better anyway since soap leaves residual odors that can interfere with the wine."
1,Don't do it!!!!,I ordered this product and when it arrived there were only 5 glasses in the set. One was missing. Amazon.com did absolutely nothing for me.
1,Too good to be true?,"Ordered the ""Buy one get one"" offer on 10/24. Received a notice that the shipment would be delayed on 11/10. Then was told that my order has been canceled, as the items were no longer available. Then, low and behold: the glasses, price, and ""Buy one, get one"" offer is still being displayed! False advertising? You decide..."
5,Solid exploration of critical issues,This volume explores the U.S. reactions to the 9/11 attacks in a careful series of essays by experts in a number of fields. I'm planning to assign it to my civics class as a means of showing my students the many issues we need to confront as a nation if we are going to maintain the democratic values that the terrorists attacked while protecting ourselves from future attacks. It raises critical questions and explores difficult issues concisely. A job well done.
4,Joey,"Well being young and unexperienced I found this book very helpful, it really opened my eyes to a new way of looking at things. I liked the way most of the information seemed to be first hand, rather than just many assumptions."
2,Electric Drill Bit Sharpener broken on Arrival ...,The unit was broken when it arrived. I think it works but I'm not sure. Two of the plastic feet at the bottom of the unit were pushed into the lower part of the unit... Bummer...
2,Don't waste your money on this toy!,This musical bear doesn't do anything interesting. There is absolutely no surprise!
1,Save your $$$$,My daughter received this as a gift for her 1st birthday. She did enjoy the music as most do at her age however as stated in an earlier review the toy is not suitable for young children. My daughter could not operate it on her own at all and even I had trouble with it several times. Unfortunatley I eventually just threw it away instead of passing it on to a friend or good will as I do with most other toys. Not recommended.
4,Pizza On The Go!,"I love Jack Links, they are a wonderful high protein snack and are very portable. This particular flavor is awesome, if you bite the pepperoni and cheese at the same time it tastes just like pizza!"
2,Disappointment-out Northeast of Aline.,"I was hoping for a revelation about the state home for orphans. I was surprised that no more was there. I knew Glen Ewing well, for he was my teacher in HS. I was very disappointed to read the language that I seldom if ever heard when I was a child and I am 8 years or so younger than Rex. I, too, grew up in this area of Ok. Also the slams given to the Church of the Nazarene were horrible. I have been in the Nazarene church since the day I was born and the Round Grove church since 1949 and have NEVER seen holy rollers, nor people talking in tongues(Pentacostals) that really belonged to that faith. NOR are they people that do not believe in Drs.!! We have many born again Christians who are also Doctors."
5,Golden Threads of History,"Out East of Aline is one of those essential works that forms the threads of the greater tapestry of our true history. Written with a true voice, it is a poignant personal glimpse through the eyes of a youth, adopted into a loving and hard-working, yet rigid, family. The 1930s some alive in Wilson's memoir when he speaks of the simple things that made life exciting and, sometimes, disappointing. This is superb social history written and edited with deft professional hands. This book is one of a series published by the Uncommon Biffalo Press. All the books in the series are beautifully written, well-edited, and typographically pleasing. This books will be enjoyed by everyone from those interested in adoption to those interested in life during the 1930s, to those who know of the importance of local history in the history of our country. Read it. It's a page-turner you won't ant to put down."
2,Not Really Relaxing...,"I really enjoyed some of Kathy Freston's other CDs and thought I would feel the same about this one, but I have to say it is not of the same quality.She talks really fast and in a very monotone voice which is not at all condusive to meditation. Maybe the producers thought the fast pace would sound more motivational, but it's just annoying.There is good material here (which is why I rated 2 stars) but the delivery is very poor."
4,Cute,The movie was very heartfelt and touching. The funniest parts were the men and how they felt about everything. It is definitely a movie for women though it is definitely something women can relate too and understand.
2,movie,This movie was very slow and I fell asleep. I found that it did not hold my interest and was not very entertaining.
4,Good Friday Night Movie!,"I actually really liked this movie. It was exactly as expected, cute & funny. Yes, it was a bit predictable..let's be honest here, most chick flicks are. I don't think there were too many characters, because the plot isn't confusing or complicated in any way. So yes, it's a typical girly movie but it has the elements that make it just that & that's why it's so enjoyable. Sometimes you don't want to watch a movie you really have to think in, so this one is nice to pile up on the couch after a long week and just enjoy the moment."
2,Not what I expected!,"I had high hopes that this movie would be funny and quite entertaining...boy was I wrong! There were brief moments that I may have chuckled and there were moments of excitement when ""Joe Manganiello"" occasionally would appear throughout the movie, but overall very disappointed."
3,Funny and cute movie,Glad i did not go to the Movies to see it. It's more of a Made for TV movie. The characters are a bit over top and unrealistic making it funny. It was a good way to kill 2 hours on a rainy cold night.
1,Expired,Movie rental time expired before I could watch movie. I must not have been keeping good track of time or it expired in error.
3,Only generaly funny,"I thought this movie would be more funny than it was based off of the trailer. It was still a good watch, but glad I waited for the video/dvd. Decent overall, but the characters were predictable."
4,Very enjoyable. Lopez did well.,"This is a cute movie, and I thought Jennifer Lopez was especially likeable. She was the most interesting character. The group of Dads was hilarious. Nice, light-hearted comedy."
3,It was okay,"It was a good movie, but would recommend watching when you have the energy, otherwise you may find yourself falling asleep!"
2,Pretty boring.,Seemed to have dragged on forever. Some interesting and humorous pays but mostly trying to stay awake throughou t it.
2,Good actors...bad movie,"The movie had some funny moments but overall it was boring and predictable. If you saw the previews, you already saw the only good parts of the movie."
3,Eeehh...,"Cliche', but that was the point I guess. Sad commentary on todays parenting. The Adoption angle was cool. Chris Rocks kid being neglected and abused, as comic relief was kinda disturbing. Self absorbed people being self absorbed. Just not very entertaining. Could have not seen it and I would not have missed anything."
3,Not what I hoped for.,"I wasn't impressed but it was an ok movie I guess. I was hoping for more heart I think. I am a sucker for movies dealing with pregnancy, babies etc so I guess I thought this would be right up my alley. Nope, not really."
3,Cute & predictable,"So cute, and some very funny parts. They did try and approach some heavier topics but it was ultimately predictable. Still a fun way to spend the afternoon on a rainy day."
2,so lame,"only a couple funny lines, if you like chickflicks its just like every other one they are just spitting out of hollywood. mediocre storyline, not worth seeing again. the blond british chick is the best character in the whole movie"
3,"ok, the dad's were the funniest part","I thought the movie overall was ok, but not one I would watch again. Probably funny for mom and dads to be."
3,Funny Movie... Good for home rental,"What to Expect When You're Expecting is a good movie for a date night or girls night when you're looking for a laugh. I would not have seen it in the theater, but paying a few bucks to see it at home is worth it."
2,My time would have been better spent......,It had a few slow spots and some over the top bad acting . My time would have been better spent watching the weather channel.
4,Cute,"Cute movie, what you would expect from the title. Fun chick flick for a Friday night with a bottle of wine."
3,Meh.,"This was an OK movie...pretty predictable and not really as funny as I was hoping. I had a promotional credit and was home alone for the night, so I thought something 'chick flick-y' might have been worthwhile. I'd heard mixed reviews and I guess I should have considered them a bit more. This is, of course, very predictable for most of the characters....and that's kind of what you would expect. The problem for me was the lack of depth to the characters. A few felt a bit relatable but you don't see as much attention paid to them. This just wasn't as funny as I had hoped, and it's not really dramatic or meaningful enough to fit into another category."
3,BLAH--A Waste of Great Talent,"My husband's daughter was expecting when I watched this movie, so I was ready to be open-minded and enjoy the film. Maybe I was too hard on the movie, because I don't have kids myself and can't relate, I don't know. To me, it seemed like a waste of great talent. I have watched these fine actresses in other movies I enjoyed much more."
2,Not so great,"This is an okay movie and has a few laughs but nothing to write home about. If you're bored with nothing else to watch then go for it but, otherwise, I wouldn't waste my money renting it."
2,IT'S REALLY NOT THAT FUNNY OR WELL MADE.....,"My wife suggested this movie since we are expecting in February 2013. We were both disappointed with the plot and the overall production of the film. There were a few funny moments, but they certainly do not warrant the purchase of this movie. If you are even considering watching it, wait until it comes to Prime."
3,Cute but kind of boring,It was fun to see some big name stars. Definately a chick flick but U already knew that. It was predictable but I enjoyed it on a rainy evening.
4,like,"Good movie, a little slow but of rthe most part a good movie to watch. I don't know if I would pay to watch it, just wait for it on netflix"
2,predictable,With the exception of a few funny moments the best parts of this movie could be seen in the films trailers.
3,what to expect when you're expecting,Good stars. Humor was good. It is better than a LOT of movies lately. At least it wasn't excessive language.
4,The Movie,"The movie was good...the quality of the streaming was horrible...so buy dont stream...I thought it would be more of a comedy, yes it had funny parts but all in all it was serious...I liked it"
1,What to expect when your expecting,Very slow & boring movie. Had some funny moments but not much. Very disappointed I wasted money buying it. Good actors in it but that's about it.
3,Not what I expected,"I chose this movie because i thought that it would be funny. While it had some funny moments, it was more mushy than humorous. Don't get me wrong I love mushy. That's just not what I was expecting. The movie touched on several issues that can and do happen during pregnancy. Some happy. Some sad. It was an OK movie"
3,Totally predictable but fun anyway,"Totally predictable but well paced, multiple stories twisted together well. An easy watch for most. . No foul langauge or sex scenes."
2,Terrible acting,"There were some funny moments, but they were all captured in the preview. Don't waste your time with this movie."
3,Not what I expected,Though this movie had some moments that really resonated it was not what I was expecting. The focus is less on the pregnancies and more on the couples relationships.
2,Didnt like it,I was expecting a better movie. First time in years thay i stopped watching a movie 5 mins before the ending.
3,struggling humor,I just felt like this movie was struggling to get most of their humor. There were a couple of ha moments but for the most part I guess I just expected more.
3,not to bad,this was not a bad movie. some funny parts but i wont be watching again any time soon. for a fun pregnancy movie i would watch baby mama instead.
1,Movie,Waste of time and money. Cameron Diaz needs to find better scripts and an acting coach!I won't rent another of her movies again.
3,Ok movie,Kinda fun but if you really have kids then you know this movie is a little bs. It is like 40 percent funny
2,Nothing new.,"Nothing new. predictable story, unimpressive script, dont waste money on this. If it comes up in prime, watch it to kill time"
2,It is what it is,"This movie is exactly what I expected it to be (hahahaha). It was a cheesy take on the ""process."" Mildly entertaining and I think my wife liked it."
1,Worthless,"I think that Jennifer Lopez ruins every movie she's in with her terrible acting. It never gets any better. Trust me, don't waste your time."
1,video viewer sucks,PLEASE FIX THE VIDEO PLAYER AMAZON....SHITTY PAUSES AND NOT PLAYING CORRECTLY...HAVE A HIGH VIDEO CARD BUT DOESNT SEEM LIKE IT BECAUSE THE PLAYER REALLY SUCKS.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not impressed,I ordered this thinking I was being clever being one of the first in the UK to have the blu ray of this film when it arrived I was so happy I wanted to see it while it was in the cinema put couldn't has I was 8 months pregnant and cinema not the most comfortableist place... I put it in my blu ray player and it told me I couldn't watch it due to the region it was an American copy and couldn't be played over here. Now I think if that's the case it should have said somewhere that that copy couldn't be watched in the UK. Really not impressed
2,slow and poor acting. not entertaining or funny,I love chick flicks but this one was just poorly made. Its not well written. not that clever. not that funny. suprising for such an all start cast.
2,What to Expect when your're expecting,"The movie wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be, but it was enjoyable, some parts where better then others. I guess with such a strong cast I expected the movie to be outstanding, and it was like too many other movies that have been made on same topic. I think also I love Jennifer Lopez, but I think this is her third movie about her having a baby, I don't think she should have done it, I totally enjoy her, but she just shouldn't have done another movie like this."
3,Ok - Not what I was Expecting,"The movie was fine. Nothing amazing or drop down funny. The plot was similar to other movies that have been done previously, but over all not bad."
3,extremely predictable with few funny bits,I guess it is nothing more or less than what you would expect from such a title. Some parts are relatable but mostly mundane and blah. ok for for dvd rental
2,Bad,The few funny parts of this movie were in the previews. Nothing else in this movie was worth watching. I was expecting more from the actress's in it.
4,cute,"This was a cute movie. I liked the portrayal of both mothers-to-be and the fathers-to-be. Some parts were cheesy, but overall it was good."
2,not really funny or entertaining.,I wouldn't bother renting it. it wasn't funny or entertaining. I actually stopped the movie then forced myself to watch the rest since I paid for it.
3,What to Expect When You're Expecting,The movie was funny at times. Not the continuous laugh I thought it would be. There were many parts that truly reflect what pregnancy is really about.
4,Funny movie,I caught bits and pieces of this movie while I was traveling but wasn't able to view it completely because I had to check out of the hotel. As soon as I got home I rented it and viewed it with my wife. We both enjoyed the movie and thought that it was very funny.
2,Classic American movie making. Never an actor's stretch.,Why do we produce non fulfilling film work here in the states? No real romance or real action or drama to come away with after spending two hours bored out of your mind. Cameron Diaz and Jennifer need to grow up now. Same stuff just a different movie. Let's try for an American version of Downton Abbey and maybe we might all learn something.
2,A poor chick flick,My wife made me watch this horrible movie. Was poorly acted and a complete bore. I dont understand why anyone would want to watch this type of movie.
1,aweful,They show all the funny stuff in the previews.Don't waste your money. It said Gods name in vain and I turned it off. Almost every movie has it now. I am a Christian and its terrible to see a movie waste on language. It was towards the end but not a comedy at all.
4,Funny,"Funny, ""chick flick"". I watched this movie and laughed quite a bit. Some of the characters are totally unrealistic but that is what makes it so funny."
3,Pretty funny,This movie was pretty funny. It had a lot of great comedy actors in it and there were several hilarious moments to be remembered.
2,Boring,There are too many story lines going on in this movie. I found it boring and annoying to watch. I hoped the superstar cast meant it was going to be good but I was very wrong! There were moments of comedy that kept md from rating this a meager 1 star but not enough to keep me interested.
4,Comedy for couples,This was a funny movie to watch with your spouse. It wasn't too cheesy for my husband to watch with me- only alone was he not able to bring himself to watch it through.
4,Not as bad as I thought it would be,"There are some days you just want to watch a chick-flick and this movie is perfect for that. It's mindless and silly, so as long as you know that is what you are gonna watch, it is good."
4,"Great, funny, touching",Great chick flick with awesome actors; there were tons of hilarious parts as well as a few scenes that were really sweet and sentimental. Would definitely watch this movie again.
1,Don't waste your time...,"This might be the single worst movie I've ever seen. Admittedly, this isn't my kind of movie anyway...but I thought that there would at least be a few laughs. I smiled once, don't waste your money...or worse, your time."
1,They never even bothered to write or create a plot,"I didn't expect much but I think this is the new low for Hollywood. There was one reason I can't call the movie boring: I was on the edge of my seat to find out if this complete drifting between different scenes and characters without any point or entertaining value was real and when it would turn into an actual movie. It never did. They didn't even bother to connect the ""stories"" together, and when they did, it was just stunningly stupid, two characters happened to be related and in the same building.I have nothing against pregancy, with children of my own, and finding birth a miracle and all that but showing various women growing throughout their pregancy and then delivering the baby is not a story. You actually have to add something to it to make it one. I seriously hope this is the bottom of the hole for Hollywood and they can't go any lower."
2,Wow,The cast was great and I got out of it what I thought I would. Nothing bad to say really. Had some good laughs but some of it was predictable.
2,So so,"Left it after about 30 minutes....blah! I was actually timing myself watching it, and wondering if I could make it to the end. Nope, got out. Just so, so."
3,boring,not much to say on this It wasn't a true look on expecting babies. Not enough research done to enjoyWhat To Expect When You're Expecting [DVD + Digital Copy]Cameron DiazIt's okay
2,Meh! Mostly lame.,It wasn't nearly as funny as I'd hoped. The only believable pregnant one was Elizabeth Banks. The dads were the funniest part of the movie and that's not saying much. JLo and Cameron were lame & lacked any chemistry or depth. Meh. Skip it unless its free and you're totally bored.
3,Not very memorable.,"We watched it, we laughed and enjoyed it, but honestly, I can remember very little about this movie now that some time has passed. I do get tired of seeing Cameron Diaz always showing that her ""older"" body is still in good shape. I'm glad for her, but it gets a little tiresome. I did like all of the characters in this movie. Even the one I thought I wouldn't."
3,Good Movie,Enjoyed the movie. Not my favorite Jennifer Lopez movie. Funny in a lot of scenes....good rental movie. Enjoyed Chris Rock
2,what you expect,Diaz is like Aniston ..plays same role over and over again-getting bored Typical storyline a few laughable moments played out story lines.
4,Cute,I love this movie. Watched it twice. It will be one of those movies I watch again and again and not get tired of it.
3,Meh...Men aren't that bad,Kinda weird movie not sure what to the take away was but the people in it were good for some things.
4,Really good!!,I really liked this movie and so did my best friend (who is 37 weeks pregnant!) I loved how they really portrayed the labor scenes! I get so tired of seeing movies with women going into labor and looking so great...when in real life you look like...well the way Cameron Diaz looked in this movie!! They all did a great job. The only thing I didn't like was Rosie and Marco. Their characters seemed kind of pointless and kind of just thrown in there (also their acting wasn't the greatest either). This movie was so funny and heartwarming...but Rosie and Marco's story didn't seem to fit. But overall...GREAT MOVIE!
1,All the funny parts in the commercial,"Never again. I really didn't like it at all, it looked funny on the commercial but its not. I shouldve known. Plus the values in the movie are horrible."
2,"Predictable, slow, meh","I wasn't expecting Academy Award level entertainment or anything, but this one was a disappointment. Just not really funny or even cute enough to call it a good rom com. And it seemed long - maybe due to lack of many laughs. The Dad's group was the cutest part. Wanted to like it more, but just didn't."
4,Better than I thought it would be!,I bought my wife the book 7 years ago. It was good seeing a theatrical version of the book come to life! Chris Rock was funny!!
2,All the good stuff was in the previews,Everything funny and cute was already in the previews the rest was boring and this is coming from someone who loved romantic comedies. Too bad !
3,What to expect,Thought the movie was rather slow. I really expected more humor. Considering the stars in this movie it should have been better.
3,Very Sweet Movie,I haven't finished watching a movie in a long time but I finished watching this one and loved it. It's funny and entertaining with some drama. A must see for thirty-somethings but a definite chick flick. One couple plans on adopting a baby and that's super cool.
3,Worth renting but not buying,"This show came out while my wife and I were expecting, so I probably enjoyed it a little more than I would have otherwise. It has some laugh-out-loud moments that I remember even a few months after watching it, which is generally an indication of a movie worth watching. I won't buy it, though."
4,What to Expect When You're Expecting this DVD,"Witty, star filled comedy. Some of the jokes leave you wanting a bit more(or less) but overall it is definitely a good watch. A bit more drama than a lot of romantic comedies, but it kind of helps balance it."
4,Cute mid day movie while doing toes,"I had high hopes for this movie. For a 'chick flick' while doing toes, it's not bad. I had hoped for a bit more comedic relief, but much was pre-canned humor and allot of per-concieved societal norms placed upon characters.Cute enough to watch...would not purchase it to watch again. Would watch it if it came on as part of my free Prime Amazon Instant Video or pay t.v. service."
3,Okay to rent,"The movie did have funny moments but in general was not that funny even though it is advertised as a comedy. It does discuss some aspects of pregnancy that people who have never had a kid might like to know about and reminds those of us who have what it was really like (since you try to remember only the good). The story line with Jennifer Lopez (the main storyline) is not believable in my opinion and it's movies like this that steer women in the wrong direction with men. Just remember it's a movie, this is not real life."
4,Good Movie,"Actually, a better movie than I even expected. We both enjoyed it. Lots of different but good stories in this movie."
4,Sweet funny chic flick,"Pretty great movie for the gals, I laughed and cried. Personally it was my kind of movie. Lots of emotion as well as a lot of different life experiences."
2,Boring,"All the funny clips are in the trailer. And the rest is kind of boring. I wouldn't recommend it. Also, has nothing to do with the book (but I figured as much beforehand)."
3,What I expected...,"The movie was ok. It has some funny moments. While I like the majority of the actors in this movie, it just didn't seem to flow. The movie to choose when there are no other choices."
3,Meh. Pretty much what you expect.,"It has a few cute moments, but for the most part, the film is very blah. I am glad I watched it, but if I never saw it again, that would be okay with me."
2,They should have adopted,Poor dialogue predictable jokes. Given the cast I would have expected a much better show but they can only say what is written for them. I only watched it because nothing else was on.
4,A bubble-gum movie that is fun while it last,What to Expect when you are Expecting is inspired by the pregnancy advice book for women although it is a completely fictional story. It has a series of different women and tells their interrelated stories as they approach motherhood. Cameron Diaz does her usual lovable air-head routine and J.Lo is rushing around getting flustered. And her husband the uber-hot Rodrigo Santoro has his own little sub-plot with a group of other young fathers as they take their kids to the park. Don't start to watch this movie expecting high drama or an oscar contender. It's just a nice women's comedy that is fun and leaves you feeling happy.
3,What to expect when you are expecting,"The movie was entertaining but it was very predictable. If you don't have anything to do on a rainy Saturday or Sunday afternoon, this would be a good pick. Just not worth paying full theatre prices."
4,pretty Funny,"In my opinion, anybody that was involved in a pregnancy will really like this movie.It is a great comedy, with all characters doing a great job."
2,just ok...,"This movie is just ok. I rented this movie after reading the book ""What to expect when you are expecting"", which is well written. This movie is a comedy & about 4 couples having a baby or adopting a baby. Nothing extraordinary. I can't give it more than 3 stars. I was disappointed by the movie."
2,Did not hold my attention,The movie starts slow and did not hold my attention. If you must see this movie go to Redbox. Its worth a 1.00 if that much... boring!
2,Ehh,"This really is not Diez's best movie. The whole thing was just poorly put together..there is too many stories going on at once, and in some movies that works, but in this one it just doesn't. With all the different couples and events that are going on the plot is taking away from many of the cute couples that could have had better stories. My opinion- cut a few of the couples and the movie might have actually been good."
2,Marginally entertaining,"Predictable and reinforces my dislike for JLo and Diaz as actresses. Dennis Quaid, Brooklyn Decker, Elizabeth Banks, and the british girl are funny in it. Sad to see what's become of Chris Rock."
3,Funny but trys to relate to everyone,"This is a good movie. Rent worthy. Things are too busy. Your are spending to much of your time trying to relate to every mini story. They try to tie it all together but done very roughly. Should have picked 2 maybe 3 storys and developed them more. If you have gone threw pregnacy, the expecting process, or ARE going threw the expecting process a few things really jump out at you as funny."
5,Very entertaining!,Loved the movie - a wide range of couples was covered and the acting was great. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw so-so ratings on IMDB but I'm glad we decided to rent this. Get the popcorn ready and be prepared to laugh!
3,it was cute,i was one of those time waster movie that accomplished its goal. i thought i could have been better but what can i say
4,Good,This was pretty funny- I'd say you get just about what the commercials show- maybe not quite as funny as I thought it would be.
2,Disappointed,"I thought this was going to be a really good movie & that I would think it was so funny. I was disappointed by it though. All the funny scenes in the movie I had already watched in the trailers for it. Maybe it's funnier to someone who is actually pregnant or has been pregnant but to me, it just wasn't good."
3,Okay movie,"This movie was just okay. There were some good funny parts but overall just okay. Elizabeth Banks character was the funniest, love her."
3,not good really,Not the best 3 stars is plenty. Very chick flicky .... overly much wit it on dat I b sayin
4,Funny but not Hilarious!,Was a good movie and I enjoyed watching it but it wasn't as funny as I had expected. I wouldn't buy it but definitely rent it and see it once!
3,Decent Movie,"Not a guy flick, but funny enough. You'll enjoy a few laughs relating to pregnancy and the jokes they use."
3,Alright,This movie was alright. I was expecting it to be more of a comedy. I think they tried to portray a comic view of life with a new kid but I found the concepts to be out of touch.
1,"Good, no captions",This movie was fine but I can't believe there are no captions on these movies. I guess no movies from Amazon have captioned. So my daughter who is deaf can not enjoy this service! I hope Amazon changes this soon
1,Seriously?!,"Ridiculous and not in a ""Bridesmaids"" way. The only decent arc is the one with the adoption (Jennifer Lopez). The rest are either typical stereotypes of pregnant women or so far-fetched they don't even make for a good story. The miscarriage story is awfully done too. Don't waste your time or money."
1,bad choice.,"i expected more humor. it was stupid, shallow and quite frankly, boring. Heard good things about it from others but was disappointed."
1,Terrible movie!,Plot never comes together. They were trying too hard to hit all the stereotypes and missed every single one. Strongly recommend that you don't waste your time or money.
1,Blah,"I wish I had my two hours back. This movie is very stupid. With the cast that it had, I was hoping for more."
1,Not that great...but what you'd expect.,"Okay movie, but just ""okay"" at best. What a waste of Chris Rock. Could have been done a lot better. Would not recommend unless there is nothing else on worth watching."
1,Waste of Money and Time,I had trouble viewing the movie at first and should have just gotten my money back when I called for help. I didn't even finish watching the movie. Too many storylines and was very juvenile. Just a plain terrible movie.
4,Entertaining,The movie was enjoyable. I had never used my Kindle to watch movies. It was a good thing and I will do it more often.
4,Funny,Any new or expecting mom must see this. Will make you laugh and you will definaly relate to all thats happening..lol
3,Not all that great,"Wife said it would have me laughing because she had already seen it, but I think I laughed once and she never did."
5,Hilarious.,So funny! I loved everything about this movie! I definitely recommend renting this movie! Great for girls night with a bottle of wine!
3,Not a comedy.,"I rented this because I thought it was a light comedy, it is more of a drama with some jokes in it...."
3,Funny,"I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't as funny as the previews and trailers had made it out to be."
2,Boring,"With the star power listed on this movie you would expect a lot more, a letdown especially in the comedic department. This was a really slow moving uneventful movie; save your money watch this one on Netflix."
3,Here is the Back of the Book Blurb,"The year is 1883. In a south Romanian village, three men and a girl were gathered in an old crypt. They watched fascinated as a wooden stake was driven into a long dead corpse. With an inhuman cry, Count Dracula departed this world. But the strange, unwinking eyes of a black cat watched their efforts derisively.In the year 1938, a young policeman on special duties was clubbed and trown into the dark waters of New York's vicious dockland. Miraculously he lived, but was condemned forever to a wheelchair. His twisted thoughts turned to the occult. This man's name was Damien Harmon. A man for a terrible purpose....To bring the Master to life again, and to unleash his terror on unsuspecting twentieth American. Could the Professor turn his back on the call? This is the first in a spine chilling series about THE RETURN OF DRACULA."

5,The King Of All Disaster Movies!,"I remember seeing this movie in January of 1973 at the Crestline Movie Theater which since has closed, with my Mom & my sister when I was 10 years old & even after 38 years it still holds up! I have the remakes but none of them are as good as the first one. This is one of my all-time favourite disaster movies of all time along with the ""Towering Inferno Special Edtion"" DVD which I also own & highly recommend for anyone! Death & despair are everywhere as a group of 9 survivors make their way throughout the bowels of the capsized SS Poseidon which was on her final voyage across the Atlantic Ocean in determined faith for freedom. 3 of the 9 are lost to death but the 6 remaining still with that strong sense of faith still continue to push themselves forward. This is TRIUMPH & STRENGH OF THE HUMAN SPRIT at its finest. A great addtion for any DVD libray! I highly reommend it!The Towering Inferno (Special Edition)"
5,Lots of FUn,I remember when this movie was released in 1972! I was 5 years old. When it came on TV a few years later I was mad because I had to go to bed because it was a schoold night! Well about 3 years after that I got to see the whole movie. I loved it. Yes the acting is a little over the top. Some of the F/X is not so hot. However what this version has is STARS. The remake sadly has bland & boring people/charectors. This movie has the infamous Shelley Winters scene. Calling this a camp-classic would be wrong! Its a classic. Skip the remake and see this!
5,"""to get out we have to go down""","this still is the best of the disaster movies to come out in the 70's and is still a very fine action movie today. gene hackman leads the cast as they are caught by a tidal wave on new years eve and capsized by it. now up is down,down is up,and the only chance to live means climbing to the bottom of the boat where there is a chance to survive. after that the movie moves so fast you won't have time to care about the holes in the plot or the things that don't make sense. turn off the brain and just lrt this one roll(no pun ment)"
3,Movies,I have always enjoyed this movie and now I have immediate access. I recommend this movie to everyone that enjoys diaster MOvies.
3,"Very exciting when it first came out, but hasn't aged well!","The special effects for this film, awesome in 1970, now seem pretty tame by comparison. As for the story line --- I've never liked it when a film TRIES to make me like a character I don't like, and that's exactly how I felt about Gene Hackman's character. I thought he was obnoxious throughout the movie, and his heroic ending didn't change my opinion!"
3,"All in all, a fun movie","A fun movie to watch, though I'd put others ahead of this one. I thought the special effects were terrific - even 30 years later, they still look very convincing. The movie tries a little too hard to push the human drama aspect, and the bickering between the preacher and the cop gets really annoying after a while...There were a few other things I didn't quite get...did they really need the fire hose to get up to the galley?? Most of them seemed fine just holding the railing and walking...also, like others have said, the thing between captain and the ship's owner wasn't all that well handled...At the end of the day I would recommend Towering Inferno over this movie - its escapes and stunts are way way more exciting and original, its characters more likeable as well. That said, Poseidon Adventure is a movie that will not fail to get your pulse racing."
5,this is the best movie ever,the posidon adventure is the best movie better than titanic or the towering infeno my video is widesreen i wish it wasint well i Just boght the dvd have a nice day.
1,"Taut, Compelling, Gripping -- NOT","One of the most colossal wastes of top name acting talent ever witnessed on film. Even the actors' making the most of various scenes cannot keep boredom from setting in and not releasing its grip until the end. Amazon and Irwin Allen have some other highly worthwhile suspense/action films that will keep your eyes on the screen quite nicely. Pursue them, rather than settling for this fiasco."
4,"what happened to featurette 7,8 and 9. I'll tell you.","Why was 6 afraid of 7? because 7 8 9!!! your mystery featurettes 7 8 and 9 are under the Conversations with Ronald Neame. and they are just that , he talks about the filming explaining how the ship turning over was filmed!!Yeah, WE WAS ROBBED!!! where is the filming of the behind the scenes of the turning of the ship!!! Its NOWHERE on this extra special release!!! Yet, I know it exists because back when this film was released, channel 11 here in Indiana supposedly showed the actual special effects behind the scenes special. A friend who knew I was into the movie told me they showed the set and how they tipped it. So where is this segment? My guess is that it is on the version that is available overseas that was released in 2003? You have to have a region free dvd player to play that one.What a bummer! Everything else on the extra disc is cool but c'mon, stupid studio, that scene makes the movie and I want to see the magic behind that."
2,Sinking and Stinking,"This was among the first of the `All-Star' disaster movies of the 70's, and which were so well-spoofed in `Airplane!'. The plot involves a tidal wave that manages to flip over a large cruise ship, and the all-star cast (at least in 1972), which includes Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Pamela Sue Martin, Stella Stevens, and Red Buttons. With the exception of Hackman (is this how you follow The French Connection ?), the rest of the cast was better suited to the Love Boat, and not this boat. The dialogue is inanely silly, and Hackman, playing a cussing, derriere-grabbing reverend, just screams through most of this. It may have some larger cultural significance, but The Poseidon Adventure simply sinks."
1,This is an edition with very poor presentation,I was really upset at the low level of presentation of this edition. I intended to give it as a gift but I couldn't give something looking that cheap.
1,"Bad Acting, Bad Dialogue and Too Much Yelling","I really wanted to like this movie and after seeing the positive reviews, thought I would. However, I was sadly disappointed. Besides the bad acting, questionable dialogue and irritating amount of scenes which consist of people yelling at each other, there were so few likable characters that by the end I hardly cared whether they made it or not. The upside-down ship was the most intriguing character in the whole film."
3,...would never be shot today (....but never say never),"There are two reasons to watch a film like ""The Poseidon Adventure"". The first is to notice what great actors can do with abominable material. The second reason is to explore and understand the 1970s disaster film genre in detail.Stirling Silliphant's impossibly unbelievable screenplay is only eclipsed by 1978's ""The Swarm"" - a film that seemed like high art to me in 1978, and seems like a multimillion dollar practical joke 24 years later.""The Poseidon Adventure"" was a difficult, incredibly expensive shoot (cuts were cornered in writing and continutity, however). Many of the crew and performers must have stories about the shoot - can't we hear those in a commentary track?"
5,Amazing Blu Ray Movie,We have just recently converted to a Blu ray player will not go back to DVD. This movie is a must with the special effects even though it was made in the 60's.
4,My Fave Disaster Flick,"The Poseidon Adventure is probably my favorite disaster flick of all time. I saw it for the first time when I was a kid and thought it was the greatest movie.The special effects are definitely dated now, but to me the ship capsizing from the tidal wave is still cool.I can't say much for the DVD version unfortunately. All you get is the movie and no extras. But let's hope there will be a new release of the DVD with more extras in the future. NBC television has a remake of the movie on this month, and a huge theatrical remake is scheduled to be out next year. So there seems to be a new fascination with this film and story.I've always thought The Poseidon Adventure was the best out of the disaster genre. I am glad to see this film and story getting some of the respect it deserves."
5,OH MY GOD!!! Lookout hard left !!!,This is the ORIGINAL disaster movie that started them all. An all-star cast which takes you on an roller-coaster of emotion. A enormous wall of water turns a glamour-rama hotel on the sea UPSIDE down. Tippity topity special effects throw you into a mega storyline that that won't let you go. A full figured Shelly Winters climbing up the fallen Christmas tree is worth it alone.Filmed from parts of the Queen Mary which you can visit in Long Beach Cali. A few years ago some friends and I went to a 30 year reunion for the Poseidon Adventure on the Queen Mary . Many of the stars were in attendance. This movie still packs a good punch years later. A for sure must see for any disaster fan when all the effects were real and not computer generated. There has got to be a morning after. Oscar loved this one and so do I.
4,All-star cast runs around sinking ship!,"There wouldn't be much here without an an all-star cast and great special effects. But those two things can never be underrated. Gene Hackman stars as a priest who leads a small group of survivors to safety on board the Poseiden after it tips over. The screanplay is quite lame, but over the top performances by Hackman, Shelly Winters, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowell, and Jack Albertson help keep things lively and powerful. And who can resist the guilty pleasure of trying to guess who will live and who will die? Disaster movies are generally not that good, but this is an exception. It's fun and dramatic, and won't hurt anyone who watches it."
4,The women make the flick,"What would have been a merely tolerable motion picture is made very viewable by the presence of three of the hottest babes working in 1972. Pamela Sue's slender and beautiful persona draws every male viewer's eyes to her when she's on screen. Carol Lynley is also terrific to look at, especially when she lip-synchs the theme song. And Stella Stevens's mature figure was far too appealing to be wasted on the likes of Borgnine. Forget about the disaster. Concentrate on the dames."

4,poseidon still turns heads,"Hands down this is the apex of 70s disaster films.The script is a little weak in parts, and some opening scenes are cheesy,but one quickly forgets this as the story progresses. Ive read people dissing the fashions and special effects, but as far as 70s films go these are not bad.The scene when the ship turns turtle is still impressive,and one considers there was no cgi,ilm or anything,its even more so. Finally, for all you nitpickers, the fashions are not THAT bad.Ive seen stars strut down the red carpet at 2002 awards show wearing gowns almost like those worn by female extras in this film!Finally,I get annoyed at people blaming the 70s for Stella Stevens wearing a pink tuxedo shirt...If something like this happened in real life,wearing a sausage skin gown would hamper any climbing activites,so what to do,have your husband give you his shirt of course! Makes sense to me."
4,Great!,"Bought this for our son in law's birthday, it arrived faster than expected & he's thoroughly enjoying it & would recommend!"
2,"Love the Movie, Hate the DVD","This is my all-time fave disaster movie, powered by an exceptional cast, solid writing and direction, and fantastic special effects. The DVD version, however, does not do this classic justice. The mono sound is lame, and the pretentious letterbox format shrinks the visuals and ruins the ""floating"" effect completely. The extras are also quite boring {if not pointless}. Fox needs to re-release this in full-screen format with stereo sound and a ""making of"" documentary tacked on. Audio commentary by the surviving cast members is also mandatory. Fox really blew it with this one."
4,Hell upside down,"The first of the (many) disaster movies of the 1970's. Luxury liner en route from New York to Athens is capsized by monster tidal wave, leaving small group of survivors to try to escape through upended hull. The first twenty minutes where we meet the characters is pretty awful, but all that falls away as disaster strikes and we get involved with the characters' plight. Great special effects with some of the interior scenes filmed aboard the Queen Mary. Great cast includes Gene Hackman as determined preacher leading the group, and Shelly Winters who's a burden until she has her moment of heroism. Ernest Borgnine is very effective as Hackman's antagonist, a loud and abrasive detective lieutenant. Leslie Nielsen appears as the hapless captain. Followed by a sequel in 1979."
3,"Although dated, I liked it","Even though this movie seems dated in technique, I thought the filmmakers - Ronald Neame (director) , Wendell Mayes (screenwriter) and Paul Gallico ( novel) did an excellent job.It was great to see a younger Gene Hackman , Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons and Shelley Winters.The FX worked and I was interested all the way through.And John WIlliams did the music!"
4,One of My All Time Fav's,"Hackman, Borgnine, McDowall, Winters, Buttons, need I say more? Quite a few of the worlds great actors are in this movie and it shows.If you've read as far as this review, you know the plot by now.Sure the dialogue is cheezy and the special effects are a bit dated, but hey this film is over 30 years old! It's still one of the two best disaster films (Towering Inferno being the other) ever made.I've loved it since I first saw it as a 10 year old kid at the drive-in w/my family. I agree with others who wish there was more to the DVD pack (maybe a documentary on making it?) and even some stereo sound but it's still a fun film to watch and a great trip down memory lane for me."
4,One of the Greatest Disaster Movies,"The first of the disaster movie cycle (""Airport"" came first, but ""Poseidon"" set the mold), this one keeps you at the edge of your seat. Based on Paul Gallico's bestseller, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" pits regular people against the forces of nature when a tidal wave capsizes a luxury liner on New Year's Eve. The all-star cast is great from Gene Hackman's fiery minister to Stalla Stevens bitchy beauty. The real stand-out in Shelley Winters(nominated Best Suppporting Actress)as a loving grandmother who is forced to test her strength and her courage to escape the watery tomb. The plot does occasionally drag and the characters are far-fetched, but for pure Hollywood escapism this Oscar-winner is one of the best."
3,Five stars? Give me a break...,"Why is it that everybody keeps saying how this movie is so cheesy, the acting isn't so great and the screenplay is laughable, yet they give it five stars? That's just ridiculous. This is a fun, mindless disaster flick, nothing more, nothing less.State of the art, circa a long time ago.THREE, not five stars (sad, but true: this is getting the same rating as the Godfather Trilogy on Amazon! That is pathetic!) IMHO: Watch this on TNT, no need to buy."
3,"Ah, so that's why Captain Nemo was in love with the sea","Reviewer Edgratto's feverish imaginings surrounding the priest and Pamela Sue Martin may well have been gratified had the producers stuck to the original book. Bizarrely, characters would pair off and have sex in various corners during their quest to reach the bowels of the ship. Pamela Sue Martin...Caroly Lynley....Stela Stevens.....Chalk one major missed opportunity. Especially in widescreen. The mere thought of hotpants kept Gene Hackman alive underwater ten minutes after the average man would of exhaled. Remember that the next time you get on an ocean liner.Cheese complainants also got off lightly. In the book the priest makes a purely existential gesture of such overblown preposterousness that ten pounds of Stilton would seem digestible in comparison."
4,great for the price,"Bought it, liked it, ok for the price but i wouldn't recommend buying from sam ash the guitar was ok but the packaging was horrid and poorly put together. On a different note the guitar doesn't stay in tune too long and i was expecting more because it was a washburn but the price tag says it all the WI15 is a lot better for $40 more so just put two more twenties in the bank."
1,Terribly Weak Magnets,"Hate it. Want to return it. I was looking for a product like this to hang kitchen oven mitts on my metal baker's rack. These hooks will not even hold up a calendar on the front of my refrigerator. They definitely would not hold anything as heavy as a coffee cup, either. I'm disappointed that the seller's discription pointedly omits any info about how much weight the items could hold. Makes me wonder why. I hope potential customers get to read this."
1,Horrible,Very weak magnets. Would not hold up a small key chain with only 2 keys.Can't imagine what they would be useful for.
2,Cheap,"These were strong enough to barely hold up a bathroom hand towel but when they fell, they'd break. Bummed about the magnet strength and how shoddily it was constructed."
2,Recommend paying more for stronger magnets,"These hooks are not as strong of magnets as I expected. I read the reviews and thought, despite some of the bad reviews, these should still work fine for my grill accessories. I was wrong. First of all the hooks are small and my grill accessories won't fit on the hooks. Second after making string to hang my accessories on the hooks, the hooks would fall to the ground because the magnets are weak. If looking for some hooks to hold an extra house key, these will work great. Anything over half a pound will likely drag these hooks down to the floor."
2,weak magnets,These are not what I hoped they would be. I wanted to stick them on the side of my safe to hang soft gun cases....not a chance. They are pretty cheesy. Magnets do not even protrude past the chrome case so the magnet itself does not even touch the surface you try to stick it to. Lame. I trimmed the case down on one to see if actual magnet contact would increase the holding power.....nope. These might be OK for a small keychain or a potholder but that's about it.
4,Suitable for light-weight items,"With metal cabinets in the kitchen, I wanted magnetic hooks on which to hang my measuring spoons. One hook for 1/4 teaspoons, one hook for 1/2 teaspoons, etc. These hooks are a suitable size for this. I have 3 to 4 measuring spoons on each hook and they work fine, however, the magnets are not strong enough to hold a plastic 1/4 cup measuring cup nor a small potholder, so consider the weight of what you are hanging before you buy."
3,Decent for light weight work,"They hold oven mits for me, but I have to be careful to keep them from falling off. Next time I'm going neodymium."
5,Finally,"Been looking all over for these, seems like a year long process. They work great and are at a fantastic price point."
2,Not all that,"Cheap and great reviews, was hoping this would be my big break into hanging kinda heavy stuff on kinda strong magnets with hooks attached. First up, put the magnet hook on a flat iron surface and tried to hang a pair of headphones off (heavy duty studio headphones)... it worked... but just barely! If I apply too much pressure when hanging the headphones -- forget it! Lay them down like I'm putting a kitten to sleep and they stay on the hook. So that's just barely OK to start. The connection between the hook and magnet is shoddy: check this -- the magnet falls on the floor once and snaps like the hook was just kind of jammed into the hole. It ain't going back in. One hook magnet down.This is not the magnet hook you're looking for. There have to be way better options out there for stronger, more durable magnet hooks at comparable or slightly higher prices."
5,"Good product, good price","Simple product... magnet holds tight to the side of a file cabinet,Would be stronger with a supermagnet, holds everything I wanted it to..."
1,doesn't hold,"I bought these based on other reviews that they are pretty strong and functional. I find this to be false. My keys (only 4 keys and no heavy keyring) stay on but the magnet is so weak that every time I lift my keys off, the whole hook comes off as well. Several times now I found the hook in my pocket or picked it up off the floor. This is a very weak magnet and I don't recommend it for the annoyance factor of having it come off every time I take thinks off the hook."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought these to hold up a standard/full size calendar for the side of my fridge. Not even all 4 are holding it up. I know it was only a few dollars, but Very disappointed. Not sure why the other ""reviewers"" gave this 4-5 stars."
1,Very weak holding strength!,"These are no good for holding almost anything! Can't put anything but the lightest item on them. Would not buy again, or recommend.Useless!"
3,"Decent, not perfect.","These magnets are strong and the hooks are useful. One of my hooks broke off within the first week though, but hey, at least the magnets haven't failed yet!"
3,Caveat Emptor - Missing Magnets,"Out of two sets ordered, I only received seven working hooks. One of the hooks was missing its magnetic base! I'm not sure how wide-spread this problem is... considering the price, I imagine there is not much QC/QA at the assembly line. Let's just say the promise of 4 working hooks doesn't always hold up :("
3,Hmmm...Gonna save the Packaging on this one,"I put these magnets on my fridge, but as soon as I put one potholder on the hook, it fell off the fridge. I tried again and it seemed ok. I am contemplating sending them back, they do not seem to be working as they should. I always remember these hook magnets, when I was a kid, on my moms fridge. They were strong, would hold just about anything! I'm kinda on the fence about these!"
3,Scratched my refrigerator,"I didn't expect these magnets to be strong, and they're not. The surprising thing is that they scratched my stainless steel - look refrigerator. The metal on the back of the hooks extends just beyond the depth of the magnet, and is not as smooth as it could or should be. I placed one on my refrigerator, and then a couple of minutes later, my daughter walked by and slid the hook along the fridge surface. A noticeable scratch was left in its wake. On the bright side, I then purchased some small, strong disc magnets. I glued them onto the back of these hook magnets and solved two problems at once -- the metal no longer reaches the fridge, so it doesn't scratch it, AND the magnets are much stronger. (I just spent more for my little project than I thought I would.)"
3,Worked Great for Awhile..,I was content with these in the beginning but after a few months they lost some of their magnetization and would just fall off the fridge as soon as I would hang the [not very heavy] set of keys on them. Next time I would get the neodynium magnets.
3,Speedo sandals,"These sandals appear to be made well; however, they're almost a size larger than my usual shoe size. Also, they leave black scuff marks when I wear them indoors on my tile floors. They're fine for wearing around the yard as getting them wet won't hurt them. I would recommend buying a size smaller than normal."
5,Shure Master,"First of all this case is oval, not round. I think amazon messed up the picture between the PA628 case, and the EA625 case. this case fits the SE Models and is the same amazing quality from Shure."
5,great album,"I purchased this CD because of a song I heard over a radio station and I have not been able to stop playing this album, the songs remind me of my childhood days, and its a pleasure listening to them. This is a good buy."
5,Children Will Feel Alot Of Respect And Confidence,"My wife and I are early childhood school teachers. I teach first grade, and she teaches kindergarten. This week, we both got the opportunity to play this CD for our classes. As usual, Bobby Susser delights and educates the children with his fantastic songs that are easy to learn, and different, but always interesting arrangements. His own style with each song gets right to the heart of every child. The messages are thoroughly understood, and the music is thoroughly enjoyed. The suggested activities are wonderful. This album for children is exceptional, and was handled with ""Respect And Confidence."" We are going to get an additional copy for our three year old daughter."
4,Consider the origins of world-wide systemization?,"If you've ever considered the origins of the way and why of the systemization in this world, take a look at what is written in this book. Whether you are a believer or not, be prepared to be confronted with spiritual realities in our everyday lives. This book is especially helpful if you desire to make a break from hierarchialsim and systemization in your day to day experience."
4,Good observation of Middle Eastern past and present.,This is a general book about Middle Eastern history. It does not provide much detail or description of the numerous events that have shaped the region but it does offer many brilliant observations that give the reader a better insight and understanding of the development of Middle Eastern cultures.This book should be supplemented by a more concise account of historic events in order for the reader to better comprehend the evolution of the region. In conclusion I found the book very interesting and insightful and I enjoyed it very much.
5,Great Foundation,This is an excellent overview of the Middle East. A great place to start understanding the current situation.
3,A book that tries to do too much.,"Dr. Lewis is capable of wonderful writing, e.g. the introduction to this book. He impresses me as learned and objective, and is selective in his details. Yet I was somewhat disappointed. Lewis needed to be more selective not just in detail, but in what he was trying to accomplish. While there is some fascinating material, there isn't enough. Personally, I was hoping for more of a book about issues, rather than about subjects: such issues as why the Middle East fell so far behind the West, why the woman's role is so circumscribed, etc. Lewis address these, but rather briefly and not very effectively."
2,A Brief Review of a Boring Book,"Like many of you, I had heard good things about this book, but it turned out to be a disappointing slog. How this or that caliph raised taxes and other equally scintillating topics get hundreds of pages of stuffy prose. The Crusades, the fall of Constantinople, Timur and anything else exciting are lucky to get a few paragraphs. The author's feelings about Islam are also a bit over the top: he describes various aspects of this religion as ""pristine"" at least four times that I counted. The history of Islam in the middle east (especially the tedious bureaucratic details) is the real topic of this book."
4,Very Easy to read,"""The Middle East"" by Bernard Lewis. published by Scribner. He isthe formost expert on matters relating to the Middle East and it isnt as detailed as some of his other more subject specific but is very informative about the culture and how history has shaped the Arab people and vice versa. It deals with differentthemes instead of just straight time periods. It goes into some surface detail like commerce, war, religion, colonialism. I have a specialty in the Middle East and this book was used at the Master's level at the American University in Cairo, Egypt as an introduction though I dont feel that I personally would use it as a teaching tool. Otherwise the book is a good read but be attentive when reading."
4,"Good, but a little biased","I'm an agronomist and I like to read books.I read this book here in Brazil.This book is good and has many usefull chapters.Even the author being a jew, this book is pro-islamic.This book is a little biased.In a page, this book claims, that Italy also entered to decadency as Islam.Obvious nonsense.Italy scientific life is, better than in islamic world.Only during WWII, daily life in Italy became worse than in many parts of islamic world.The author never tells nothing ""politically incorrect"", against islam.The islamic slavery against white europeans and even more, against black africans hadn't almost no place, in this book."
2,What's the agenda??,"Prof. Lewis is obviously a smart man, but for someone who is recognized as an ""expert"" in the Middle East I find his books very biased. To me he comes across as being a bit condescending to the people who live in the Middle East and an apologist for many of the policies from the west that are somewhat responsible for creating this ongoing discord. Not enough emphasis is given to the 20th century history. If you want an excellent book on this area I recommend, ""A History of the Modern Middle East"", by William Cleveland. I have lived in the Middle East for many years and Cleveland's book is by far the the best written and most objective I have ever read. It's good to read different viewpoints so there is a lot to be learned from Prof. Lewis's books, but you won't get the whole picture if he is your primary source of information."
1,Boring!,"The first two thirds of the book are unreadable. After every few pages, I would ask myself: ""what have I been reading? Did, I get anything out of this? The book lacks any focus, connection, and sequence for my mind to hang on to. Granted, the last third of the book reads much better. But, it is not worth the pain of the first two thirds.If you are eager to understand Islam in a world context, and understand current events worldwide, I strongly recommend Samuel Hungtington's ""Clashed Civilizations."" ..."
1,Outdated Thesis,"Bernard Lewis' arguments are somewhat overtaken by history now, despite his contributions to the field."
4,A Good Introduction to a Complex History,"I cannot agree with the statements of some that this is ""dull"" or ""booring"". I am not aware that a serious reader expects non-fiction, history books to be exciting! I think that says more about the reader than the author and this book.Professor Lewis has done and excellent job of providing an introduction to the history of this area and setting out a foundational explanation of the genesis of problems that exist today. I found the organization difficult to stay with at times but I am more accustomed to a linear historical format.One does not have to be a serious student of history to appreciate what this book offers. I would recommend this book highly, especially for an understanding on a very basic level, of why the U.S. has no business invading the area."
3,An average study of the Middle East,"Having finished this book I cannot recommend this book as worth the reader's time to read cover to cover. The author's decision to not tell his history in chronological fashion makes it difficult to chart the development and flow of Middle Eastern history. Even worse, his prose is dull and lacking insight, making the book a slow read.The best use of this book is to find it in a library and look at its table of contents and decide if any of the chapters would interest you or add to your own research. Each is topical in nature. Read the chapters which interest you and ignore the rest, there are better treatise on Middle Eastern history worth reading cover to cover."
4,Good work,"The Middle East, authored by Bernard Lewis, is a welcomoe addition to any library. It is clear, succinct and lucid. The typeface and paper compensate for any drawbacks the book may have.John Gooch"
2,Not what I expected,Not at all what I expected. I wanted more action and/or suspense but didn't get any from this flick.
4,STYLISH SUSPENSE,"I will never know why Teresa Russell did not become one of the most visible actresses in Hollywood after this movie -- she is wickedly spectacular in this stylish bit of suspense. And Debra Winger plays the good guy with just enough ambivalence to give the movie a real tingling quality. It features a suspense/murder plot that essentially involves a serial killer, and is shot in some spectacular locations. As the women get closer, the heat turns up -- and the wrap-up is satisfying, neat and clever."
5,Classic,Another great movie that didn't seem to get the play it deserved. I love the mystery of the whole thing. Watch it.
1,reprints with different names,"I do love these authors and was so glad to find a new book. But. . . it is a collection of two books I already have put into one volume with a new name. Not quite the nice reading time I was looking forward to. I won't be the only one to buy it without knowing this so look for used ""like new"" to be available quickly. This is The Ship Who Searched and Partnership simply put in one volume. If you want these two books it is a good deal - if not . . ."
1,Repackaging old books,"I was so excited for a new Anne McCaffrey, and it's not new at all. If you already own these pretty old stories, don't bother with this book -- it's nothing new."
1,It's a TRICK,"This is not a new book, instead it is a combination of two old books. I bought it and then realized the flaw. I almost thought of keeping it, but Baen Publisher has produced such a low quality product (thin pages, etc) that it would not hold up very well. AMAZON, get it together and give it a proper description."
3,Reprint of older books,"The brain ship books are superb writing and if you don't have the older books, it is well worth getting. But the description is deceptive in that it does not tell you that this is a compilation of three books reprinted together under a different cover. Therefore, I am returning the book."
4,Anne McCaffrey,"I have been a fan a long time. Have all Anne's books in HB. Am now getting them for my Kindle. These two stories are not her best in the Ship series, but still a good read"
3,Great concept/Lousy Lock,"Can be tricky to set combo. The lock is difficult to engage and disengage when you first get it. In setting it, I think I had to apply so much pressure, I accidentally pushed it to a different number.I was able to figure out which one was wrong( assuming it was only one of ht numbers that was off, I just systematically tried every remaining combo).Should be handy for the beach and tying up the stroller in places where I just want a deterrent from the easy grab. Clearly, if someone really wants your stuff, they can cut this thin cable, but a passerby can't just snatch and go.Light weight and portable.Good Luck and take care when setting the combo.customer service not so friendly. He siad I could mail it bcak to the company ( at my cost of course) and they would send a new one, but only after he spent most of the call pointing out the thing things I must have donewrong to make it happen.oh well, at least it works now."
1,don't waste your money,"This lock does not even deserve one star. First, I could not get the cable into the lock. I had to stick a screw driver into the hole to get it the right size. Then once I got this fixed, it stopped retracting. I have not used this lock one time and as far as I'm concerned it is junkck."
5,"Well written, hugely informative","David Gutierrez' book is one of the most informative, thorough books available on the Chicano experince in the US Southwest. This book is not just for activists or chicano studies scholars. If you have ever wondered why immigration policy exists in its present form, or why racial tensions still persist within the southwest, read this book. It is very densly packed with valuable infomation and excellent sources, and it presents such information in a fairly unbiased manner. This is an impressive work of research that should be in the library of every house in America."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,I just received this today and I love it. It does exactly what I need it to do. The blades are extremely sharp and the thin slicing setting is wafer thin. I bought this to make homemade potato chips and it gives the perfect cut for a potato chip. As time goes on I will be sure to edit this review if I have any issues.
4,Very happy with my decision to purchase this item!,"There are so many high priced slicers on the market. I looked at all of the reviews, and this one got the best ratings. After using the product I am very happy that I selected this one. Its easy to use, its stores and dries in its own case. And most importantly it slices great and gives me lots of options.The only issue is that I believe the description says that you can wash it in the dishwasher, but in the directions it says you can't.Overall I recommend this product over the other ones featured."
4,Slicer,"This makes perfect slices each time. It is easy to clean up too. Sharp blades never snag. I can make thick slices, thin slices or julienne."
3,Good slicer but a little flimsy.,"I paid $39.95 on Amazon for this slicer and while it slices great I really expected something less flimsy at that price. The plastic is very thin on this unit. Yes it slices great but what a cheap piece of ... well you know. The best thing this product has going for it is that all other Mandolins are so expensive.I bought this slicer to do one thing, slice potatoes very thin for a layered potato dish I make frequently that requires 1/8 inch thin slices and takes forever to do with a knife. This slicer allows me to slice the potatoes in 1/10 the time. But if this unit was built a little sturdier I would feel better about it. But it does slice great."
3,You get what you pay for,"Slicer worked great, to a point. Once the blade gets dull, thats it. The seller provided excellent service, but after having it for a few weeks I'm wishing that I had spent the extra cash and bought a better product. The height of the slicing angle in relation to the surface that your slicing on is simply not a good design. Basically you can slice 1/3 of a potato before you either have to move the slicer to another location or remove the sliced product that accumulates beneath it."
1,Not for me,It was difficult to pick the tips of my fingers from out of the fries. However the fries we're delicious.
1,Flimsy and very poor instructions,"The storage area for the two blades is so tight that the tip of the blades are scratching the plastic every time you put it in the holder, how long can that last before it destroys the blades? The insructions are only about 30 per cent in English, the parts you really need are in German. It slices 95 percent of the piece, then. You have to dig out the rest between razor sharp blades. I cannot believe this thing got so many good reviews. I am sending it back"
3,very dangerous to use,I've had my v-slicer for 30 years now and have almost sliced off a finger more than once. Dont even think about using this without the holder. To many unprotected razor sharp blades. Very dangerous piece of equipment! Other than that I found it very limited in the variety of cuts. I would like to make waffle fries but cannot with this. Also the slice blade is either too thin or too thick. The other blade hasnt been much use to me either. It has been sitting in the garage and not sure how to dispose of this. Im an experience home cook and make most everything from scratch. I've been looking for a different mandoline for some time and have not pulled the trigger as of yet.
3,it was actually pretty good,"one of my gripes is clean up, it's not really easy.... I also just think that it's a little bit too much of a pain to take it out to slice just one tomato, I would rather just use a knife. However if you are going to be doing a whole dinner with it, it really does make slicing a lot easier"
2,Not worth the stars,"I bought this item for my wife soley by looking at the high ratings and great reviews from the others who bought this item. My wife was dissapointed in the product. Although care was used, she almost sliced her hand. The blades did not give us the diversity of cuts that we wanted. Overall, it is cheap for a good reason"
4,Very nice for the price,"I was a little skeptical at 1st about a plastic body slicer. But since I've been using it, this mandoline has performed flawlessly."
5,The Swissmar Borner V-Slicer is Awesome,"My last mandoline went back to the store when it couldn't slice through the skin of a tomato. Well let me tell ya, you won't have that problem with this beauty. I love this thing. Of course you can tell by all these great reviews that this is an awesome product. I love the sharpness, the cutting plates slide in and out easily, the hand protector works great (make sure you use it if you value your skin) and I like the way the gentle pressure of the palm of you hand when holding the protector is enough to advance the food item at the perfect rate. I also like the way you can rinse it off and slip the whole thing wet into the holder and it drip-dries right in there. I just let it dry on the counter and then store it standing up in my cupboard. I wouldn't change a thing on it."
5,Works good,"Bought this after shopping for a reasonably priced yet functional mandoline for quite some time. Product had lots of good reviews so I went for it, and am not disappointed. Slices stuff really well. Simple but effective design. Easy to clean. Watch those fingers, this guy is sharp. Will probably buy another as a wedding present for some friends."
4,Swissmar Borner Mandoline,"Easy to use and clean up. I had some difficulty slicing yams on the mandoline only because the handle prongs did not penetrate the yam deep enough. Of course, it could be the yam's fault! Anyway, other veggies/fruits sliced and diced nicely and fast. Be careful...the blades are sharp."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this mandoline. However, it does a horrible job with slicing mushrooms. I have yet to try slicing anything else because I'm so discouraged..."
3,Gift,"This was purchased as a gift for someone who requested it. I haven't tried it personally, but I will update my review when that changes."
1,Easy to use...,"Light weight not particularly rugged but very good at slicing most anything you can imagine. Will slice partly frozen steak, or ripe tomatoes thin as paper. Great addition to your kitchen!"
3,Have not used it yet,"I purchased this slicer 2 weeks ago. I have not had time to use it yet, BUT it is not white it is a tan color. I do not like the color because it looks dirty to me. My preference is white appliances in the kitchen, however, i heard this is a good slicer so i will live with the color because it is not an appliance i will keep out on the counter."
1,Bad Experience Here,"I have not had the experience of so many others here. The item is not easy to set up, one must be careful of the blades surrounding the borders of the slicer inserts. Not easy to clean, made mush of the tomatoes, and potatoes.Sorry, my experience rates this one star."
2,Makes a good White Elephant gift?,"After reading a ton of reviews all over the place, I finally settled on this as my choice for inexpensive mandolin slicing. I should have passed.As far as I can tell, the only things I think it would be good for are hard vegetables without a lot of juice. My first (and second, and third) attempts to dice an onion with this were abysmal failures-- and extremely messy ones at that, too! I have since gone back to hand-cutting larger pieces, then throwing the bits into the food processor. (I love the taste of onions, but not the texture. I cook them down very, very soft.)Using it to slice carrots and parsnips was a little easier, and less of a mess, but still more work than I think my food processor would have been.Having been used very little, it is now resting in its box with all manuals, waiting to be gifted to a friend or family member. Maybe s/he will get more out of it than I did."
4,Have used it once so far and liked it.,Used it once and liked it. I hope it continues to work as expected. It did fine on the eggplant.
2,Wasted food and stained too easily,Like others before me I had the same problem with the mandoline staining after my first use trying to julienne carrots. Also it would not completely julienne the carrots leaving at least a quarter carrot every time. I specifically bought this as a foray into Asian cooking but it's just not that efficient so back it goes.
5,Best thing to own!,This is a replacement for one I own for 16 years. this is one of my kitchen gadgets I cannot be without. Makes perfect slices. Great for dicing too. the perfect thing for preparing salad. Gonna get one for my summer home too!
3,pros and a big con,"Yes, this slicer is very sharp... and I would have loved to give it a spin, but I had the hardest time releasing it from the safety clip, that I pulled it too hard, and it came flying out of the ""safety"" container, slicing the pad of my thumb off to the bone... how ironic for a safety feature. :T It's been 4 years since that incident, and my thumb has still not healed all the way, and I have long since given my slicer away. The mere sight of it gives me the willies. But, if you're looking for a sharp mandolin, I would say this is probably the sharpest out there. Good luck.. be safe everyone.. buy a kevlar glove."
2,Does not work very well.,I bought this based on reviews I read but was disappointed. It does not slice an onion very well. The thickness of the slices was uneven and it snagged when slicing. It definitely does not work for tomatoes. I spent more time trying to use this than if I had sliced the vegetables by hand. It was also a pain to clean. I would not recommend this slicer.
5,Outstanding Kitchen Tool,"This is a real gem. Perfect tool, easy to use and easy to clean. Very versatile and something you will reach for again and again. Who needs a mandoline?"
5,Swissar Borner V-1001 Slice Plus Mandoline,This met and exceeded all my expectations I would recommend it to all who like to cook and those who want to save time cooking.
3,Didn't live up to my expectations but does the job.,The piece that you use to put on top of the item you are slicing is useless so you have to be very careful not to slice your finger off. I think I will being the gloves that protect you from getting sliced. I haven't figured out how to make it make super thin slices for stuff like ginger. It's made out of plastic. I kind of wish I spent a little more time shopping online before settling on this. It's actually more convenient for me to cut my produce with a knife then having to clean this thing and worry about cutting my hand while using it. Other than that... it does what it says it will.
3,Where are the accessories?,"This mandoline works great, not really worth it for small batches, tricky for the cleaning part and rather flimsy on the storage side, but the most important question is:Where do we get the accessories from? Not at Amazon in the US, not anywhere in the US, barely Amazon in Germany, and only on the German site which does not translate into English!The 3.5 mm insert is great for many things but still too large for thin julienne (e.g. carrots salad), and the other 7mm insert is also great for many other things but still too thin for thicker julienne (e.g. real french fries). We need an importer and amazon US seller for the 1.6 mm and 10mm inserts, and other useful and popular accessories."
5,Great timesaver,"I purchased this for a friend as a gift, since I already have one myself and love it. It's a great timesaver and easy to clean. Just be careful - the blades are extremely sharp."
5,I'm a convert,"Purchased to replace a really old Zyliss mandoline, this simpler, smaller unit does the job. It's quite sturdy and the guard is useful, so I use it. Easier to clean and store, I think it was a real value."
4,SHARP!,"MY HUSBAND, WHO I PURCHASED IT FOR, WAS BUMMED IT WASN'T ALL STAINLESS STEEL. BUT THE CUT OF THE BLADE WAS IMPRESSIVE! A GOOD BUY ESPECIALLY FOR AS MUCH AS WE USE IT. ONLY THING IS THE BLADES AWKWARDLY HOUSE IN THE UNIT & IT'S ABIT WIERD PUTTING THEM IN PLACE FOR STORAGE."
3,Great for slicing - julienne? not so much,Slices white/red/spanish onions & tomatoes well. Julienne for bell/sweet peppers? Nope. NOTHING I tried to juilenne worked (maybe potatoes would?) but I wanted Chinese.Bummer.
5,luv it luv it,i cant say how happy i am with my first mandoline sliceri studied a lot of reviews and this one is everything it claims to beuse the safty holder and you will have no leftovers to cut by handclean up is a snapthe carrier is great and provides safe storage for the rest of the family
3,Nice Slicer but be careful,"I loved my v-slicer when I had it. I would use it all the time to cut up onions, make chips, etc. It worked beautifully. Unfortunately, one time I needed to use it, and I couldn't find the safety holder. Seeing professional chefs use mandolines all the time without a holder, I decided to try it. Everything was going great, until I felt a sharp brief pain. I sliced off a bit of the padding on my middle finger! There was blood everywhere! A quick trip to the ER took care of everything, although I still carry around the scar. Needless to say, I learned my lesson. No slicing without the safety holder!On a more dismal note, after about two years of constant use, food became harder to cut on the slicer. More muscle had to be used to get even simple things like tomatoes sliced. I finally had to toss it. That's a shame because I really liked it. Hence the three stars."
5,Swissmar Madoline,I bought others and they didn't compare. this is the simplist and the best. The v blade is better than the straight.
5,Excellent Slicer!! Use With Extreme Caution.,"You will not be disappointed in the quality and performance of this machine.However, you must be cautious of the very sharp blades, while slicing, and also when handling the slicer.I work with single edge razor blades on a daily bases to remove window decals. I have not yet been cut.I was amazed to find that the ""V"" slicer blades are sharper.I actually cut myself while removing the slicer from the package. Apparently my finger touched one of the small julienne blades and I did not realize it until the bleeding started.The slicer works very well..... but you must re-learn the meaning of ""sharp""."
5,Only Wonderful Things to Say!,"This is my first mandoline so I read all of the reviews prior to purchase. Thanks to everyone who takes the time to write reviews because I couldn't be happier with the Swissmar Borner V-Slicer Plus! It works effortlessly and slices perfectly with little waste. I love how it fits together in it's own self-made ""box"". It comes with its own hand guide so you don't need to purchase that separately (as it suggests). I also watched a demo on youtube (type in swissmar borner v-slicer plus) that is helpful. Love it!"
5,very sharp,excellent mandoline. be careful though because my wife cut her finger on it already. i told her to always use the food holder and now she knows why. keep away from kids.
5,Busy-Mommy,"This is one of those ""must haves"" for anyone who is serious about cooking and cooking healthy. This tool allows you to use fresh fruits and vegitables in a variety of applications without much fuss or labor intensive chopping, dicing, and slicing. It's great for a busy mom like myself who will find herself in a matter of weeks the mother of three children all under the age of three. My two oldest girls love to eat their vegetables and I am convinced it is because I take the extra few minutes to incorporate fresh veggies into their meals. The V-slicer helps me do just that."
4,Be careful,The product works very well.In reading through the comments I can see I am not the only one to end up in the emergency room by being careless with this device.Be very careful the blades are sharp.
5,The Borner V-slicer is better than a food processor,"I purchased a Borner V-slicer from an infomercial more than twenty years ago, the blades are still as sharp as when I first purchased the unit. I get uniform slices and dices each and every time I use the produduct. I use it almost daily, it makes food prep a breeze. It really is better than a large space consuming food processor."
5,Useful Kitchen Tool,"I haven't had a chance to use the mandoline much yet, but am very pleased with its performance so far. It did an execellent job of thin-slicing lemons for lemon pie with minimal effort. The item is well constructed and thoughtfully designed."
5,Great quality,Great quality! I am very satisfied. I adviced all my friends to get one too. I use it often and really love it.
1,Flimsy,I was replacing old Mandoline and this did not fulfill that. I returned this item. Blade was dull and hard to use with dull blade. I tried cutting a vegetable and not only was it difficult but it stained the surface of the Mandoline. This one not for me.
4,Mandoline,"Works pretty good. Easy to clean. A bunch of parts to keep track of so if you're cramped for storage this may not be appropriate for your kitchen.There seems to be no way to sharpen the blade so I won't be putting it in the dishwasher and when it gets dull, I guess I'll be throwing it away. Scary sharp now though."
3,Results not quite as good as expected,"After reading all the positive reviews here, I purchased one of these hoping to reduce the amount of time I was spending chopping and slicing things for meals. However it wasn't quite as useful to me as I had hoped it might be.It's an all right slicer, but I had trouble getting even slices out of it. It tends to tear out the back edge of whatever I'm slicing. It's not a huge deal, but the slices were not very 'pretty'. I also felt the safety food holder didn't hold very much at a time. I ended up cutting a cucumber in 6 pieces and having to reload the holder several times to slice it all. All in all, it wasn't any faster than a knife for me and had less attractive results.On the up side, cleanup is fairly easy. I just sprayed mine off with the faucet sprayer. The safety storage box is also fairly easy to use, and it's nice they include it since the parts ARE so sharp. I'm probably just going to get a salad shooter instead of this item though."
2,Not a good purchase,"I found the instructions and the mandoline itself difficult to use. My son and his wife (both scientists) found it difficult to figure out as well. It was very flimsy as well, and didn't work. I returned it."
3,Good,"This thing has a lot of german words on it. It's german engineering, too much and complicated. At the end of the day it works fine. I wonder if it has any competitors. The blades are super strong! Stay away from them when washing. I had to have my boyfriend show me how it works because it was complicated to me initially. I use it. It works. I would look for something better though."
2,not a fan,"I had never used one of these before and was impressed with the reviews on Amazon, so this was the mandoline I picked. The price seemed right, and the reviews were decent. But when I actually used it, I realized it's not a very good Mandoline. I don't like that it's got no legs to elevate it like so many other models have. This is a dangerous tool, and without the legs it just feels a lot more dangerous. It also has no real option to adjust the thickness of the cuts. Other mandolin's have a dial for adjusting the width. This only gives you two thickness options, thin and thick. Also, there is no blade for crinkle/waffle cut, and you can't add one either. Some of these facts are in the description, but it's not until I got the product that I realized how important the options are. I was pretty disappointed with this, and will probably very rarely use it. I definitely recommend forking out some more money and getting something that's more versatile."
4,nice slicer,This slicer is nice and sharp. I wish the thicknesses were more adjustable but it gets the job done well.
2,Not too happy,"I used my slicer for the first time and am very disappointed. I tried making thin sweet potato slices and the slicer just didn't do the job. If a raw potato is too much for the blades, then I don't think this was worth it. This model came so highly rated that I'm very surprised and let down. My hope is that I somehow used it wrong. If any of the happy reviewers can advise me, I welcome their comments."
4,Gets the job done,"I nearly sliced the tip of my finger off the first time we used this product and spent several hours in the emergency room. I'm an experienced Boy Scout Leader, have a garage full of dangerous power tools, and should have known better. USE THE HOLDER IT COMES WITH!We have owned ours since around 1996 (paid about $20) it has had many trips through the dishwasher, on the top rack, without any noticeable deterioration of the plastic or metal. We made potato chips for a party the other day and it worked fine, making consistent transparent slices with very little waste.Storing the unit and its inserts are a problem. The holder is clunky and the parts fall out. I bought a plastic pencil/paint brush box drilled a bunch of holes in it for ventilation and we store it in that.Gets the job done, is durable, and is a good enough value that I can't justify buying a more expensive mandoline until this one breaks or wears out."
2,useful for someone - not me!,"This thing was difficult to deal with - getting the blades and cutter out of the holder is tricky every time. I found that it did not make cutting easier or more uniform - just more time consuming. I tried using it when I was doing a canning project and it just didn't help me much. I gave it to a friend who has carpal tunnel syndrome -- I think that it will help her a lot more since she can't hold a knife.If you can hold a knife, don't bother with this thing."
4,v-slicer does the job.,"The swissmar borner v-slicer plus does an awesome job. The only complaint I have is that the vegetables that need to be sliced or julianned must be on the small side, the holder will not contain a large onion or potato or tomato. Everything else is as advertised. It is very sharp and will easily slice your finger or anything else in its way."
5,AWESOME!!,"Couldn't expect anything less from Germany. Right out of the box started using it and it cut so easily (on everything) that I was checking to see if anything was even being cut. The blades are seriously sharp and anyone who complains about that obviously does not know what they are buying (surprised knives do not come with a ""warning sharp blade"" warning). Did nick myself after barely touching the blade but that was my own fault and I will not blame it on a sharp blade like the trend seems to be for those who were just clumsy with their own thumb like myself. Would recommend it many times over.It really does not look like much and even using it, it does not look that great. Looks can be very deceiving though."
2,Not that great for me,"I have tried to use this a few times and have never quite figured out why so many people love it. The safety handle thing is difficult to use with most vegetables and wastes at least some of each one. If the vegetable is not very solid it usually disintegrates long before I can get it sliced. The printed information with the slicer claims the holder can be hung on the wall but for the life of me I can't figure out how that works because blades go in the back and the saftey handle goes on the front. For those reasons, I cannot recommend this product to others."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"Just got this product..pretty good so far. I wish it had a stand, as you have to hold on to it. Also, I find it is very messy and took me a while to clean the blades, product and cutting board as things seem to go all over the place. Also, I like to julienne vegetables, zuchinni, carrots etc and there is lots of waste due to the holder not working well with these kinds of vegetables. It does work well for a while, but towards the end, the zuchinni sticks and will not work anymore which leads to waste. Most of the zuchinni did julienne very nice, just wish they had multiple type of holders."
4,Mandoline,"This mandoline is of German manufacturing. I thought that meant quality. However, it looks disappointly cheap.It cannot be cleaned in the automatic dishwasher.I used it to slice beets, pickles, and peppers for canning. It worked very well for the slices I needed.Despite the abuse I put this mandoline through, it performed very well."
4,First slicer,"I took a few tries to get used to this and haven't tried anything but the slicing blade yet, but it made great thin slices for homemade potatoe chips. There are dozens of warnings about using the protective grip to avoid slicing your finger off and I didn't take any chances. So far, no complaints here."
2,Waste of money,I bought the V-slicer after reading all the great reviews and was totally dissapointed. My $5 slicer from the discount store did a much better job. I bought it mostly to cut french fries. If you plan to use it with softer vegetables try it. But I wouldn't reccomend it for slicing potatoes or carrots!
2,flimsy,The plastic is flimsy and stains readily. It does a very poor job of slicing ripe tomatoes.Does an OK job of slicing firm veggies.
4,not sure yet!,"I've only used this tool once and yes, it's very sharp. I cut myself just getting the parts out to use. But I kept on and sliced onions and carrots. The main blade could be a little sharper. It's fine until the last bit of vegie, then jams up a bit. Also doesn't handle smaller pieces well as the part that holds the vegie to protect your hand is pretty wide. Guess I can't expect it to do everything, but I wasn't thrilled my first time out. I'll continue to work with it - maybe I just need more experience."
4,Great tool,"This cuts everything so quickly and very sharp. The problem is storage. It stands up but we cannot mount it to the wall with the carrier it comes with so i leave it on the counter standing up. To remve the mandoline out of the holder, theres a latch before you pull it out and a little bit difficult to remove."
5,Poor cook's mandoline,"The V-slicer is very sharp and easy to clean. It works well with everything from tomatoes to potatoes. It doesn't have all the settings and options of a full-fledged mandoline, but it does what you probably want done most: Thin and thick slices and julliene and french fry cuts. Good deal for the money."
5,Love It!,"We love this thing! It is used so much, especially in the summer, it hangs on the wall near the sink. I had an OXO mandolin I gave to my daughter-in-law; it worked, but was so hard to clean as the attachments are stored inside the mandolin and they got dirty too. The storage container for this one is excellent. You only have to clean what you use. It's very sharp, the holder works better than I expected, and I keep a Kevlar glove coated with rubber to use for other items.Simpler is better and good engineering is better yet. You can tell that there was some real thought to the user in this design."
4,Great Slicer for the Budget-Conscious!,"My husband and I have wanted a mandoline slicer for years, but just couldn't justify the expense. We wanted a good one, but most of the good ones are incredibly expensive for the average user. After researching and reading reviews, we chose this one, and we're very pleased. It slices thin enough to make potato chips that are even better than the bagged kind, and makes slicing veggies for salads or stir fries quick and easy. The blades are extremely sharp, but the safey guard protects your fingers. My only complaint is that there are only 2 choices for thickness, rather than a dial or knob to adjust to the exact thickness you want. But to me, that feature wasn't worth an extra hundred bucks or so."
2,It never felt safe... and now I know it's not.,"We used ours weekly since we bought it a few months ago to slice potatoes. I always felt it was unsafe as the hand guard does not slot into the base in any way and so slips around a lot. I refused to use the thing, preferring a knife, but my husband loved it.Until last week, when he took off the end of his finger. Completely. His hand on the hand guard slipped as it tends to do with this machine, and ended up with a trip to the ER and blood ALL over the kitchen.I think I'll be sticking with a knife in future."
4,A good value,"I have wanted a mondoline slicer for quite some time as I cook a lot of vegetables. But I was always frightened away by reviews from people who had cut themselves and/or suffered some sort of slicing injury. True, this slicer is VERY sharp. But if you follow the directions, always use the safety features and use your brain, this slicer will be a welcome kitchen addition. The only thing I have had a little trouble with is creating thick slices of sweet potato -- but with a little practice even those became easy to make. Unit is easy to clean -- but again -- be careful! I would never let children use this slicer. Best part about this item is the quality delivered for the price."
5,Deedeedinah,"I bought this slicer at a garage sale over 20 years ago for $5. The person getting rid of it couldn't have been a foody . Who knows when they bought it or how long they used it. It was the best $5 I ever spent. I use it constantly and on many different foods, even cold meats and ripe tomatoes. It's still as sharp as ever. I will say I don't normally use all the attachments only because it's so quick why bother to stop and change it out. The deep palm holder keeps food firmly in place. I love this thing. Mine has a holder for everything, locking the blade safely away and it stays out on my counter. It certainly beats the price of the expensive metal ones (which my daughter has and it doesn't work as well). I LOVE THIS SLICER. And now that I found it again, I will buy my daughter one."
4,Good value,"I decided against ordering another OXO mandoline because that design makes long items like zucchini get stuck. This one does not have the same plastic ""v"" underneath, so it's not a problem. The best part of this unit is that everything stores neatly and safely away. The blade is very sharp, so that is a good thing! Unlike the OXO however, you can't select from range of thicknesses for slicing; just thin and thicker. I think this will work fine for me however. The quality of the plastic seems a bit cheesy as compared to the OXO."
3,Maybe....,"I'm still practicing. Have talked myself out of giving up several times. It is very sharp, but so far have not found it especially easy to use. Hopefully, I'll get it mastered soon or it will go to the back of the cupboard."
5,The next 25 years,"I bought my first one about 25 years ago and it has been my go to gadget. It began wearing out about 6 months ago so without thinking twice I begaan the search for a replacement. You can imagine the number of new products on the market in the past 25 years, but I only wanted the Borner V slicer. It never needs sharpening, I love the safty feature when you store it away. And in 25 Years I only cut myself once and it was my fault for not having used the safty handle. Lesson learned. Hope you enjoy yours as much as I have enjoyed mine."
5,Borner V-1001 Love it!,"I have to say I wasn't sure I would use this very much but have found it is so easy to clean and change blades I use it all the time. I watched the videos on u-tube which really helped me understand how to dice onions, so fast and easy I can hardly believe it. I think I have used it every day since it arrived. Love thin sliced onions on my turkey burgers and it 2 seconds it's done, perfect. Thicker slices for liver and onions. I've been on a diet so slicing and dicing for salads if super fast. Wish I had ordered this long ago. Do be careful the blades are like razors but the guard works perfect. I really love this slicer."
4,Awesome slicer,Best slicer I've ever bought. Makes cooking so much easier and more enjoyable. A must buy for any cooking enthusiast. Beware!....blades are super sharp.
2,"This really is a DANGEROUS tool, and missing a part","I managed to slice my finger on it the 2nd time using it.(I consider myself very coordinated and not accident prone by the way) It's not easy to clean either since the blades are so sharp. So, I'd guess one would need to settle on some veggie stains. They say all you need to do is rinse of water and store in it's safety box, but just a rinse doesn't get things off. If you soak it in sudsy sink.. you might cut yourself going into the bubble blind to fetch the pieces to clean.Also mine shipped with two 7mm julienne pieces. i was missing the 3.5mm piece. The sole reason I bought this was to make zucchinni noodles. It made great thick 7mm noodles but the process to obtain these noodles was risky."
3,Works but it's a bit cheesy (pun intended),"It does what it's supposed to do... slice. However, the quality leaves a bit to be desired. On the other hand, this is not the most expensive mandoline. If you're looking for a cheap solution, this is it."
2,Works as advertised but BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!,"Yes this item slices like a hot knife through soft butter but will do the same with your finger.I was in the ER for 3 hours last night as the Doc. reattached the tip of my index finger. I admit I thought I could do a couple of test slices of a potato but, even sliced long way the slicer got my finger. DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT A SINGLE SLICE WITHOUT THE HOLDER.... Also the directions are confusing and it will take you 10 minutes to figure out how to use the V-Slicer although I'm certain once you get the hang of it you'll be quicker.Please be careful even with the holder, as the former demo fellow said, he even lost a finger tip after years of demos because his hand was wet and he slipped.One more thing the ER Doc. said I wouldn't believe the number of patients he had with the same injury from the same device.........."
5,"Works great, lasts forever","I've had mine for over 10 years, and it works as well as the day it was new. I can still dice 10 cups of onions in 3 minutes, slice tomatoes, or julliene carrots faster and better than you would believe. Then rinse it in cold water, store it in its holder, and you're done.Probably the single best kitchen gadget I've ever bought, along with my Gerber knives (which you can't buy anymore)."
5,The only one of its kind,"This is the third Borner V slicer that I have owned. I went through two of them in 7 years as a prep cook in a resturant, and they performed better than any other slicer on the market, and I tried several of them before I discovered the Borner. Now, at home I have got the latest model and it is a beauty-everything I could desire in a slicer."
5,Super efficient slicer,"A great little tool, solidly constructed, works just as advertised, makes very short work of slicing and dicing. The blades are scalpel sharp, so follow the directions and warnings to the letter: always use the food holder, rinse off the parts to clean, and place in the holder to dry. It would be easy to hurt yourself badly if you don't treat this instrument with great respect.That being said, I find myself using the slicer very often. It does a much better job than a knife, and the work goes much, much faster. Saves a great deal of time in the kitchen."
5,like any great instrument--it makes you look good!,"my borner was passed to me after my fathers death. there were noinstructions except ""be Careful"" from mom. after figuring out theprocess (w/o shedding blood or losing body parts) i found it was useful everyday and i can't imagine not having one. i did try a lessexpensive one and it went back in the box to retire into the darkness of the garage. its poor blades were such risk and the store wouldn't take it back as used we can't even sell it at a yard sale it's so nasty. i highly recommend Borner and mine is going strong after 12+ years."
5,Slices and dices everything but my fingers!,"The Swissmar Borner V-Slicer Plus is a great slicer. It does everything it's supposed to do and doesn't do what my last one did, which is take hunks out of my careless fingers. The safety features alone make it worth twice the price."
5,Works great!!,The v-slicer works great. French fries are thin and delicious. Tomatoes are sliced very thin. You could never do that with a knife. Cuts prep time by more than half!! This item is a must have for everyday cooking.
2,disappointed,"I was introduced to a mandoline in a cooking class and loved it! I looked on Amazon to find one for myself - after reading the reviews in my price range, I ordered this one...I'm disappointed. The food to be sliced does not slide smoothly over the blades, it often gets stuck at the bottom. The cap is designed to safely hold the food while slicing, but it is difficult to push the food down while trying to glide it back and forth over the blade - bad ergonomics? Finally - heed the warning about ALWAYS using the food-holder cap! My own fault - I tried to shortcut and the cut on the top of my finger was so deep - the finger tip is still numb! Dumb!"
2,Plastic wears easily,"I found that the rubbing of the vegetable holder against the plastic rims of the base as you slice is enough to wear the plastic of the holder and I ended up with crumbs of plastic in the food. This really surprised me. Of course the blades could cut the plastic if you turn the vegetable holder the wrong way and the holder comes into contact with the blades but this wasn't the blades, it was just the plastic rails that are the edges of top of the base. I don't see how you avoid having the vegetable holder rub along the edges of the base as you finish slicing a particular piece of vegetable."
3,Good durable item,"Does the job its supposed to. Nothing to rave about, but has a good blade set. Its been two years and still going strong"
2,Hard-to-use slicer,"This one takes practice and I never got the hang of it. Made a few desperately poor slices. Some too thick. Some too thin. I'm a Ph.D., but putting my valuable spare time into learning a kitchen gadget was out of the question. I sent it back."
1,TOO DANGEROUS for beginner cooks,"I read many of the rave reviews, but this was one Amazon purchase I have regretted. This is a precision German kitchen tool (extremely sharp!), no doubt about that. But in my opinion, it's inappropriate for casual home use. First, there is a cumbersomeness to it when taking it in and out of its protective container - I thought I would accidentally cut myself so many times. The plastic pieces are meant to be easy to remove and put together, but they get jammed together, but leaving them out for convenience would mean danger. The pain of having to be this extra careful prohibits casual use (i.e., not worth using for slicing potatoes for only 4 people). I also did not want my four year old to be watching me use it, lest she try it on her own when I am not around (you know children). I have decided to give it away today. To be fair, it's a great product for a caterer or a small start up restaurant."
2,Disappointed,I bought this product as a result of the raving reviews. However I was disappointed since the product is fiddly to use. It is difficult to wash if what you are slicing gets caught in the blades. The blades are very sharp.
4,Love it!,"Given all the warnings in reviews about how sharp this thing is, I was actually afraid to take it out of the box!Once I got over that, it was great fun. Beautifully sliced radishes and cucumbers, matchstick carrots... so far raw beets have been the only thing that didn't really cooperate with the slicer (parboiled they were okay). I look forward to many happy times with this slicer. It would be nice if the holder somehow attached to the rest of it for storage, but that's a minor detail."
3,Instructions in English Would Have Helped A Lot,"This product came with instructions in every language except for English. I'm pretty sure I figured it out, but I am also pretty sure I'm missing some functionality simply because I didn't have full instructions."
3,"4 good songs, plus others...","I loved ""Valotte"" and ""Help Yourself"" the most as far as Julian's works go. This LP didn't grab me the way those others did. However, I must note that the song ""Crucified"" is dedicated to an old friend of mine, Kevin Gilbert, who past away a few years back in Los Angeles. Kevin Gilbert was a brilliant young man (who studied my solo music), responsible for discovering Sheryl Crow, and co-writing her first hit song. He and Julian were, apparently, good friends and hung out together. If there is one shining moment on the album, it's this tribute to a talented but nearly unknown young man from Northern California, forever 29 years old. Thanks for the tribute to Kevin, Julian. I was hoping to meet you at Kevin's funeral in Glendale."
2,Cheesy,"This is not a very good album. Julian has an amazing voice and the quality of the instrumentals is great, but the quality of songwriting on this album leaves much to be desired.If you're looking for muzak, this album is the way to go, but do not expect any sort of contemplative, reflective, or simply interesting lyrics from this effort."
2,Dull,"Having been a fan of Julian Lennon for his first four albums, I expected more of the same, obscure, sound-good tunes for Photograph Smile. How disappointed I was to discover that not a single song was memorable after listening to it."
2,Overall I Was Surprised...,"I had seen his many performances on late night shows (with both ""Day After Day"" and ""I Don't Want To Know""), I thought these songs were reasonably good (I emphasize good), but not heartstopping great. My friend lets me listen to the whole thing, and I feel there's some good stuff on there a bit, but a big chunk is shallow. One song that annoyed me the most was ""How Many Times"" (I can't explain, you have to hear it for yourself). I don't know why the album rubbed off on me like it did. I guess it was just the little (big) things. The overproduction can be a bit nerve-wracking, and I feel his voice can come off as ""comet-clean"", like no emotion. I say that as a Beatles fan. But some songs are quite good, but ""some songs"" doesn't make an album. Plus my friend has bad taste in music (besides the Beatles, of course), so I should have known better."
1,Oh lord!,"Come on. Let's take a breath and have a moment to reflect on talent. This album is nothing but soft-rock/easy-listening smaltz. Predictible rhymes, accompaniments we've heard thousands of times, and all the easy grace of a Disney movie theme sampler. I wouldn't worry about Julian's influences from his father. He borrows enough from everybody else who borrowed from his father that the trajectory of familial influence hardly matters. Bad."
4,"Julian Lennon Back on Top with ""Photograph Smile""","Julian, we hardly knew ya. Just when we thought we would be deprived of Julian Lennon's sardonic brand of pop music, he returns to the world stage with the tour de force ""Photograph Smile."" My wife actually picked this up in England for me when it was released in Europe last year, and only now do many of my American friends know what I have been raving about. Two obvious questions to answer: ""Does he sound like his Dad?"" (Yes.) ""Is the album good?"" (Yes.) Julian can't help his genetics, and comparisons to his Dad at the this stage of the game are boring. He is an artist in his own right. Get over it! From ""Day After Day"" to ""Crucified"" this album does not disappoint. Though perhaps not as haunting as ""Valotte,"" ""Photograph"" is the work of a less self-conscious Julian Lennon, who has matured into a fantastic artist. Welcome Back, Jules!"
5,A very emotional and sensitive experience.,"I have been a devoted fan to Julian since the release of Valotte back in the early 80's. In this album I feel Julian is expressing his inner feelings about events that have happened in his life. I feel very connected to this recording somehow. I felt emotionally overwhelmed after listening, intently, for the very first time. Thanks so much Julian. Your music touches my life in a very special way."
5,beautiful music,"I never in my mind relate Julian and John Lennon, I think of them as two separate musicians. Whether I like or dislike Julian is regardless of what I think of John.The music on this CD is spectacular from start to finish. I should say that it is an extremely gentle album, with the vast majority of the tracks being soft ballads. 'Walls' springs to mind as a beautiful piano ballad, which is haunting to say the least. 'Faithful' is a duet and it is probably the most catchy song here. I love this one, particuarly the duets and the girl's voice singing is extremely pure and sexy.'Good to be lonely' is also acoustic driven and contains some excellent lyrics.Even though I haven't mentioned most of the tracks, they are all wonderful. It should also be pointed out that all those who love this should try and get the b-side 'don't let me down', which is another piano ballad, as fantastic as anyting on the album."
4,Julian finally finds his voice,"Although this album is over produced in some places, the music and the message really come through. Julian sounds wonderful, the lyrics are often thoughtful and well constructed, and it seems that he has finally found *his* voice and stepped from the shadow of his famous father. This album continues to grow on me the more I listen to it, I especially love ""And She Cried"", ""Crucified"" and ""Photograph Smile""... keep up the great work Jules!"
5,LOVE IT!!,This is the best music I have heard in a long time. Honestly sounds like John Lennon reborn. Even the style of music is the same. Good luck Julian!
5,I really did appreciate this book for many reasons.,"I really did appreciate this book for many reasons. First of all, there were not too long descriptions of places or things. In general, descriptive passages were few and short. Second, it is a realistic novel; it is not a far-fetched novel. Third, there was a good suspense. I did not guess who was the killer until they found it out. It is an unpredictable novel."
4,I Don't Want to Go to Bed,"This book was a easy reading and totally enjoyable. All young readers having a bad time going to bed should read this book. This book is also really great for babysitters to read to thier children, whom they put kids to bed and which this is a really great bed time story book. I personally like this book because of it's beautiful pictures and kids get a kick out of this book."
3,"Fine product, but dimensions are totally wrong!","This product works as described, but the description states (copied directly from Amazon) ""15.2 x 1.5 x 4 inches"". The item I received is 9"" x 6"" x 0.5"". This doesn't really matter to me, but Amazon should describe the item correctly."
2,Psychology rules???,"A very nut on a personal level, a big fat dad character is being depicted as a saviour of a local detective squad for his intellectual abilities and degree in psychology.Well, sometimes good to watch a time to pass by."
4,Looks indestructable...,"Mine turned up in black as well, and had a small plastic shell over the fixed lower mount instead of the clever looking pivot on the display. Even so, cheap for what you get. I suspended a 24"" Sony Vaio all-in-one, no problems. I'd estimate the Vaio is about 25 pounds, far heavier than a 24"" LCD monitor would be."
4,well worth the money,"I'm using this arm with a 23"" Samsung monitor.Connects easily to the desk with 2 wing boltsConnects easily to the monitor & has all the necessary adjustments.( tilt, L & R twist but hight is fixed )The hight adjustment is fixed & requires you to remove 2 boltsat the base of the arm to adjust hight.This is not a problem ... just set your hight & tighten the bolts atbase of the arm ... great value"
3,An alright product but...,"The product I received is black with allen-wrench tighteners and screws with covers. Sure, the monitor pivots all the way around, but you cannot raise and lower the monitor that much and you have to chose a fixed position. I chose this for the price alone, as all other monitor arms are a bit more expensive. if you are looking for full customization, look elsewhere. This is alright if you are just looking for a monitor arm to get the monitor off your desk. I use it for my 12WX cintiq."
3,"This item is black, not white","As the title states, this item is black instead of white. We had really hoped it would be white, but we had sneaking suspicions after seeing the customer images. Now for the other bad news: this mount does not freely adjust vertically; bolts must first be removed, the arm repositioned and the bolts reinserted. I guess you cant really expect much for this price. Otherwise the product feels well made and there is a cable feed through the center of the arm so thats a plus. We will try the mount for what we had intended, but may be returning it anyways because of the color."
2,misleading product description.,"Wanted a mount for our monitor so we could raise it up out of the way while desk was being used for other things. this mount does raise the monitor , but is not easily adjusted without removing a few bolts. It is even limited to four positions, only achievable by totally removing the arm and with a fair amount of difficulty, re-inserting the mount bolts in the base, while holding the monitor with one hand. Also the arm is a little ugly when viewed from the front, with a big bolt clearly visible.I know it was only thirty bucks, but the info should have a better description of how the mechanism adjusts."
2,Ballet Concert .06,I thought that the entire DVD would be concernedwith ballet which was the reason I had purchasedthis item for my granddaughter who is taking ballet.Title was misleading
2,I don't get it,"I bought this movie because of the excellent later Coen movies, and because of the good reviews here.After having seen it, I don't get why it is so praised. It may be a case of the best qualities of the film having been used many times later in other films, and so seeming old hat now. I don't know. I just know that I simply did not find anything interesting about this film at all. The actors were competent, but not remarkable. The dialogue uninteresting. The plot ditto. The pictures primitive often. For instance the start scene was inside a car that was supposed to be driving in the rain, but it did not look at all like it was moving at all."
3,Ghoulish film noir,"The story deals with a seedy bar-owner who suspects that his wife is cheating on him. He employs a private detective to track her movements, then kill her, but the gumshoe thinks better of it, and decides to betray his employer. The scripting and directorial debut of the brothers Ethan and Joel Coen (script by Ethan and Joel, direction by Joel) remains an intriguing art-house thriller, reprising such nutcrackers as ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", and full of the signature touches that went on to make the Coen brothers famous. A chilling sense of amorality, plenty of irreverent humour and cleverly orchestrated and truly macabre encounters make this a memorable and absorbing picture. The story partakes more of the sinister, the unpredictable the truly ghoulish, and it could easily cross the frontiers of the thriller and pass itself off as horror. A very good film indeed."
4,Good.,"I am a huge Coen fan, but I put this one off for a while, because the 80s are so unappealing to me. But it proved that I really can't go wrong with a Coen movie...even if the 80s soundtrack is not to my taste."
3,A stylish film noir...,"The basic fact (a Texan bar-owner is betrayed by the private detective he hires to murder his faithless wife and her lover) is transformed by an imaginatively tortuous script into a clever, almost farcical study of humans forever misinterpreting each other's actions...While the audience understands what is happening, the characters, their perceptions distorted by suspicion, fear and jealousy, strike in the dark and destroy friends, enemies and themselves... Murder, too, is a dirty, protracted business - one character is even buried alive - just as, in the Coens' irredeemably seedy Texas, the corrupt private eye (marvelously played by M. Emmett Walsh) sweats continuously..."
5,Buy it. Watch it. Enjoy. Repeat as necessary. Begin NOW.,"The praise that's been heaped on this auspicious debut film from Joel and Ethan Coen is deserved. Intricate, tight plotting and exceptional performances contribute to a completely engrossing, thrilling movie. The self-conscious visual flourishes (homages to Hitchcock and Welles abound) only add to the fun. Great to see this movie finally get a respectful DVD treatment."
4,A beautiful debut.,"The first and one of the best coen movies, Blood Simple is a movie with so many twists and turns. The first time I saw it, I didn't notice everything that really happens. After seeing it a few times, I can see every little detail that the coen brothers beautiful hide in this amazing movie. A very creative and over-looked movie, Blood Simple is among my favorites. It takes a lot for me to give a movie five stars, so I gave it four."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A cleverly-plotted neo-noir, Blood Simple is hampered by the fact that only Emmett Walsh shows any charisma--the lead couple is so wooden that the audience is hard-pressed to care a hoot about them; it's not a bad movie, but it's not very special either."
2,"a simple story, a bit gruesome","I didn't really enjoy this movie. The story is of a love triangle that leads to a contract killing that goes bad. There are twists and turns to the story, but they are the only things that keep the story going and they didn't really seem that fascinating to me. The answers to the questions that arise are answered fairly quickly so there's not much tension or mystery built up. There's some gore. There's a pretty good joke near the end. It's a chance to see Frances McDormand, who I think is a really good actress, in an early role."
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"I've heard about this movie for a very long time. I've always wanted to see it. But now that I have, I want my time back. The characters are frustrating to the point where they all needed a good smack on the back of the head. M. Emmett Walsh's acting was the one high point. Even if the script isn't clear about his motives, Walsh shows what a great actor he really is. I can't say the same for anyone else in the movie. I know the film makers were trying to be funny (burying someone in a plowed farm field is supposed to be humorous.) But the pacing is so slow, it's painful. The trailer quotes Alfred Hitchcock's line about it taking a long time to kill someone. But he was talking about the suspense, not about the stupidity of the crime. This movie is a perfect example of ""Stupid people are more irritating than evil people."""
1,Deliberately Obtuse Nonsense,"I don't know what kind of twisted brains would think this movie is great, ""one of the Coen brothers best"", but it is a sick movie with no redeeming message and no sympathetic characters. One feels obliged to watch it to conclusion because one hopes to find some kind of logic or some insight into what motivates the characters. The actors are wooden and often mumble, if they speak at all. There is nothing memborable, nothing to make you want to watch it again. Instead one feels it was a total waste of time to watch this degenerate crap. Fortunately I did not buy it but saw it on TV. I would not recommend anyone buy this DVD."
1,Big waste of time,"The Coens went on to make some great films, but this is a real dog. Boring, slow, and it just doesn't make sense. Reading another review, I see that this is a director's cut and much of the film is missing. That might explain why the film is so disjointed. Many questions - few answers. Why does the PI decide to kill Marty instead of the intended victims - he has the money either way? Where did the fake murder photo come from? How does Abby appear in the next room when she locked herself in the bathroom? Why did I actually watch the entire movie?A complete, unedited version of the film might reveal a more satisfying experience but I doubt if it would help the pacing. I love many of the Coens later films, but this should definitely be skipped."
3,"Tex revus da movie, not da disc!","Gosh I thought this was great when I first saw it! Still okay I guess, but the patented Cohen Brothers ultra-violence and all their pretentious stylistic touches look a lot tireder now - maybe 'cause they've been copied so many times?"
5,Blood Simple is a Terrifying Film,"I first saw this movie working overnight in a group home. All alone with the lights off, I was terrified. Something about burying people alive terrifies me. The movie shows two very young and inexperienced directors making a horror movie with few special effects and instead paying some great actors. It is scary and wonderful. I saw it in the theaters once and that was great too. A terrific little scary movie with the right combination of suspense, blood and eeriness to make it a classic."
3,Directors' Cut Disappoints,"I couldn't wait to see this, one of my favorite movies, on DVD, but the Directors' Cut turns what was a tightly wound, gritty story into something that meanders a bit and loses its punch as a result. I give the original version 5 stars, but the DVD is a great letdown. With movies like Blood Simple, less is more. What a big mistake to tamper with this masterpiece!"
5,The most enjoyable audio commentary ever,"First, there's the movie -- our introduction to the Coens' bent sensibility. But on this DVD, there's another sly pleasure: an audio commentary by ""Kenneth Loring"" of ""Forever Young Films."" It's a satire of all the *other* audio commentaries out there, devolving into a kaleidoscopic rant of epic proportions -- and all the while, BLOOD SIMPLE is happily playing out on the screen. Kudos to the Coens, to the unbilled audio performer, and to whomever had the idea in the first place. This commentary is worth the price alone -- and you get a great movie too!"
5,The Coens 1st movie,"The Coen Brothers first movie fills like a good, really good, USA film. It has great direction and acting from everyone. A few high tension parts, a few what the hell parts, and a few parts that make you squrim are lavished though out this movie.Don't miss for lover of mistery/sespence/thriller movies and a must have for Coen fans."
5,"Interesting, but unusual movie","Blood Simple was an unusual film in plot, but certainly worth the time. Keep an eye on the Detective ... his character is not emphasised in the beginning but he is central in the overall makeup of the movie."
1,"DVD? No,DZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZD","Why oh why re-release this movie and put out a lame duck DVD? Wow, subtitles! What a bonus! Thanks Universal! Y'know the fact that it boasts sound should be considered an extra too. Or even better, there is actually a Movie on the disc! Oh the choices! Fans should be paid to put this cheap afterthought of a product in our collections. Everyone wants to know why I only have Horror or Sci Fi in my collection? Boring, tepid, rip off DVDs of classic flicks like this are the answer! When ""BS"" was re-released I was psyched because I thought a well-packed DVD was on its way. Boy was I wrong. I know it may seem beneath the Coen Bros. to do a commentary track or an interview but they have to wake up and, at least, insist on a more insightful release. Shame, on them, for letting this just shuffle out like all their other movies. Funny, ""Blood Simple"" gets a dud DVD and ""Mummy Returns"" gets the royal treatment. Why??"
5,But not the Commentary,"Yes, this is a great film. Very off-beat, both visually and story-wise. However, I found the 'tonge in cheek' commentary to be STUPID. I guess I missed something. Maybe if you know it is tonge-in-cheek and only listen to the first few minutes of it, then it is ok. I was looking for insite into the making of the film, the dialog, how scenes were shot, who was up for the different parts, etc. You know, the usual commentary. Oh, well. Other than that, I enjoyed the film and have added it to my Coen Brother's library!"
4,An auspicious start,"Ok, the movie is great. The Coen Brothers are polarizing -- people love them or hate them. I happen to be in the former category. Those that don't care for them complain that they are cold, mannered and contemptuous. Well, yeah, so?The brothers's style consists of a meticulous, extremely self-aware craftmenship coupled with merry, snotty ironic narrative distancing. It is unique, literate, and droll. In Blood Simple, their debut, their style is already in place, and mature.Of particular mention is the DVD commentary -- it is by a dull, pompous, ill-informed--and entirely ficticious--film historian, who discusses myriad film tricks and techniques, while remaining blissfully clueless as to the plot or themes of the movie. If you are a fan of DVD commentaries, check this one out--it is savage, on target, and hilarious."
4,"GREAT FILM, BUT WHERE IS THE THEATRICAL VERSION?","I have never seen the theatrical cut of this film, but I have heard much about it. While I really enjoyed this version, I feel I'm missing something, by not seeing the theatrical version. The 4 star rating is for the DVD release not the film which is 5 stars!The film regardless of which version you see is truly mesmerizing. Every time I figured out what was going to happen, they would throw in a surprise!.....something that rarely happens to me. I really don't know how to describe this film, so I'll tell you this,..... it's got infidelity,... murder,.... robbery,.... ""blood"" and it's not ""simple"" by a long shot!"
4,"Blood Simple (1985) ""The Director's Cut""","Unusually for such an exercise it is some three minutes shorter than the original theatrical release. The Coens shortened the film by tightening the editing, shortening some shots and removing others altogether. In addition, they resolved longstanding rights issues with the music: the original theatrical version of the film made prominent use of The Four Tops' ""_It's the Same Old Song_"", but this had to be replaced with Neil Diamond's ""I'm a Believer"" (made famous by The Monkees' cover) for the US home video edition (though not for international video versions). The ""directors' cut"" reinstated the Four Tops track, as the Coens had always intended."
5,a superb gay saga...,"once i picked this book up, i couldn't stop until i had finished it! absolutely fantastic! it was very interesting to see behind the scene of pre and post war america stretching from the 30ties to the 90ties in one go!"
4,A good musical... A mediocre sequal.,"Next to Stanley Kubrick, Richard O'brien is my favorite person. However, RHPS brought something to me nothing else could-- self expressionism. Shock Treatment is great viewed as a musical but there's no way it could fill RHPS's shoes. The characters aren't as good, the songs aren't as memorable, and the point isn't half as strong."
3,you need a bit of.. ooh.. shock treatment!,"as a ""sequel"" to the RHPS (and since its not the easiest film to come across in a store)i expected a lot more from this movie. i mean i have seen rocky live a countless amount of times and its still great to watch even now but i dont think i could sit through this one near that many times. it was somewhat interresting but really, there were only a couple of really catchy songs and the whole thing was really missing alot of the fun and entertainment i would have expected from Richard O'Brien. if your a big RHPS fan chances are you will not find this to be a great movie but i suppose if you have no expectations of it being a ""sequel"" to rocky then it would be a bit more entertaining."
2,I Was So Disappointed.,"This is a classic example of what happens when you set out to make a cult film.Mere words cannot describe the awesome wretchedness of the plot and script of this film.The only reason to give it as many as 2 stars is that some of the songs -- specifically the title song, ""Looking for Trade"" and ""Little Black Dress"" are fun."
1,What in the name?,"Was this supposed to be a movie? This has to be one of the most tasteless, most horrible 'thing' I have had the displeasure to view. I can't believe I wasted a part of my precious life viewing such nonsense. this movie definitely has my vote for mankind's most horrible movie. Kudos to the director for such a profound lack of vision."
1,disapointing,the rocky horor show had some of the greatest music I have ever herd in my life and this made me ashamed I know the rocky horor show. I do not want to beilive that is related to the cult classic.It was so horible I JUST MADE IT THREW THE FIRST 30 MINS.It was dum never rent shock treatment it was one of the worst films i ever saw.
5,DVD,I have not seen this film but i am a fan of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and despretly want to see this film but it is very hard to find.[...]
4,How to Watch Shock Treatment.,"This film is not as good as the original, but it still is a good movie for die hard fans. But you have to know how to watch it. The biggest confusion for me when I first watched it was the fact that the entire movie takes place on a TV set. But then I realized that Denton is a TV station. Marriage Maze is a marriage cpunseler, Dentonvale is the local hospital, Happy Homes it the place to live in the town, The morning shows are the newspapers and reporters, and Faith Factory is the local church. But like any of these, when you associate them with TV, they all become so fake. Good movie and excellent representation on reality."
4,Get Commited!,"If you are a fan of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, or any cult movie, for that matter, this movie's worth a look. Cliff DeYoung and Jessica Harper star as Brad and Janet Majors (the hapless couple from RHPS), now unhappily married. They are contestants on the game show Marriage Maze, a sort of Newlyweds Game for people on the verge of divorce, hosted by Bert Schnick, a blind, abrasive German (Barry Humphries, in a hilarious pre-Dame Edna role). Brad ends up on Dentonvale, a reality TV show run by Doctors Cosmo and Nation McKinly (RHPS veterans Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn). As Brad is drugged and dragged off into the care of Nurse Ansalong (RHPS veteran Nell Campbell), Janet finds herself flung headfirst into the heart of the local TV studio,quickly becoming a local celebrity. And past that, you'll have to see the movie to find out what happens."
4,The irony is...,"...that one of the only way I've been able to get friends to watch this movie was to say it's a follow up to ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" which ultimately does ""Shock Treatment"" a disservice, as it has little to do with RHPS and is in a completely different style.Where RHPS was an affectionate parody of celuloid horror and seventies excess, ""Shock Treatment"" is a ruthlessly enjoyable stab at 80s commercialism and the trend of life iteself becoming entertainment (and this was nearly 20 years before the whole ""reality show"" wave.)The music is perfect new-wave and the cast does a superb job. Jessica Harper's Janet is sultry and has a stunningly deep, smoky voice. Nell Campbell is underused, but a delight when she is onscreen, and Patricia Quinn and Richard O'Brien seem to be having a great time!Watch it with an open mind, you may just enjoy it."
3,We'll all put Denton on the map,"The first time I watched this, I didn't think much of it. The second time I started getting into it a bit more and after the third I couldn't stop watching it. The real strength of this movie comes from the songs, and its a shame the storyline doesn't compliment this. Otherwise it would have been an easy 5 stars. I recommend this video if you are a fan of musicals, but dont expect it to be anything like 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'."
3,RIK with a silent P,"This movie IS difficult to watch, and it DOES have a charm that takes a while to warm up to - but for all you YOUNG ONES fans out there, RIK MAYALL sings and dances his black little heart out in the ensemble! His screen time is skimpy, but he's in the background all over the place all the way through."
2,"GREAT SONGS, BAD MOVIE","While Jessica Harper is just terrific, and the songs are actually quite good, the biggest problem with ""Shock Treatment"" is how incredibly...dull....it is. The film lumbers along with no focus really except Brad and Janet's crumbling marriage and how the head honcho of the tv station lusts after Janet. Sadly, the film is just a big yawn."
2,An almost decent sequel,This movie would be a good film if you didn't no it was a sequel to or had never seen Rocky Horror. It has its moments and a few catchy tunes but pales in comparison to its predecessor.
1,OUCH!!!,"Dear God, what a travesty!! I was shocked and appalled when I sat down with this film. I expected a less-than-great sequel, as most are, but this was just beyond.The returning cast (Richard O'Brian, Patricia Quinn, and Little Nell Campbell) were great, but they were the only returning members of the original Rocky Horror cast. And I hate to say this, but Richard O'Brian ran out of good songs with Rocky. This film just made me cringe over and over.Any Rocky Horror fan who plans to sit down with this one should expect disappointment and disgust."
1,O'Brien fails to recapture the magic of RHPS,"Richard O'Brien had a smash hit and cult movie classic in The Rocky Horror Picture Show. In Shock Treatment, he tries to recapture the magic and fails miserably. Lacking the total submission to camp that made RHPS great, this movie falls flat."
1,WORT SEQUAL EVER,"This movie was extreamly painful to watch. It never makes any sense at all, there are none stop songs(none of wich are any good at best, disturbingly painful at worst). Life is short, use it wisely, avoid this movie! P.S. If this film does grow on you it's like a cancer."
5,Shockingly fun!,"This movie is fun from the start to the finish. Way ahead of it's time. RealWorld, RoadRules, BigBrother, Survivor, all the reality shows owe their thanks to this film."
5,NOT a Rocky Horror Picture Show part II!,"This movie is great! The music is awsome,no doubt about it.Still to call it a Rocky Horror part II is in my opinion wrong.Shock Treatement doesn't have anything that refurs to R.H.S except using the names Brat and Janet and has Little Nell, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn and charles Grey in it using different names. So no Riff~Raff,Magenta,Columbia as we know them from R.H.S.Still I find it a very good movie and numbers like ""Little Black Dress"", ""Shock Treatment"" and ""Denton"" got me jumping around like the timewarp has done so many times.Do not expect a Rocky Horror Picture Show part II."
4,"""Alimony is just another word for...""","Don't expect another Rocky. This is a movie for anyone who has ever been subjected to sit before a live audiance at a television taping! The warm-up person at a taping revs you up to laugh at anything, and applaud at anything, no matter how stupid. This movie is just like sitting at any TV taping! Put a small candy bar under your seat and applaud and laugh as you were the audience. Do this, and this movie is more fun than a trip to Hollywood! (If only you could get Greg O'Roark to host this video in your livingroom!)"
4,Confusingly funny but a dissapointing follow-up to RHPS.,Brad and Janet were magically better singers in this one as compared to RHPS but not as magical on the screen. There was more thought in the lyrics of the songs but maybe too much thought in the overall plot. It was very overdone but funny in a cheesy way.
5,Shock Treatment finally released on DVD in the USA,"Overseas may have gotten it first, but another website states that the USA version features 1) Trailers 2) 5.1 audio 3) Making Of 4) Music Retrospective 5) Widescreen and my favorite of all: 6) Commentary Yay! This makes me haaaapppppyyyy!!!!"
4,"OK Well Then, Hmmmmm","OK so this is often considered a sequel to Rocky Horror. Well It has two characters with the same names, but a sequel, not really. Although not quite as enjoyable as Rocky Horror, it is enjoyable in it's own rights. The tunes are catchy, the story strange, the actors even stranger, and that's what makes this movie what it is, fun.Oh, and Little Nel as the nurses aide in this one, man she is hot....Shock On!!!"
3,Collection rarities,"Even die hard Rocky Horror fans will cringe at this movie. This film is like the seriously embarrasing black sheep sister in the Rocky Horror family. However, unlike Rocky Horror that you can enjoy multiple viewings of, this is worth only a one or 2 time look. If all the original cast were in it, and maybe a bit darker of atmosphere, it may have had a chance. God Bless Richard O'Brien's 70's rock #'s in the original masterpiece. This is more his 80's excurtion in comedy. You'll need shock treatment after watching this! However, I like weirdness, and there is some remedial value on that level. I own it as a Rocky fanatic, only for completing the collection."
4,"You need a bit of - uh, Shock Treatment...","... just in case you're a Transylvanian and haven't seen this movie! It's as much fun as Rocky Horror and there are of course quite some parallels between the characters (Cosmo+Nation Mc Kinley = Riff Raff and Magenta) and it's just fun! You'll either love it or hate it - but as a typical Transylvanian, you'll rather love it!"
1,Simply horrible,"One shouldn't compare this with RHPS because they definitely are worlds apart. This movie definitely falls flat with no redeeming qualities. It is aptly titled though, since anyone thoroughly enjoying this movie would definitely be in need of 'shock treatment'."
2,Una estafa ...,Esta pelicula no tiene nada que ver con la extraordinaria Rocky Horror Picture Show. Buenos actores y buena musica pero una trama estupida y aburrida. Si van a comprar esta pelicula solo porque es la continuacion de una pelicula de culto les recomiendo que mejor ahorren su dinero.
1,A very poor movie,"Sorry to say that this movie is nowhere near the caliber of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which it tries so hard to be, but just isn't. I expected a lot, but somehow, ended up extremely dissapointed. This movie failed to capture my attention no matter how hard I tried. I think that I would have had more fun watching paint dry on a wall than having to see this movie again."
2,"Being a Rocky Horror Fan, had to see it but......","Great wardrobe and acting and set, but the storyline and songs are garbage, garbage, garbage (except the little black dress song is a good one)..... it's an old movie, but what went wrong? If you are on a tight budget or can't tolerate a movie that's not pretty good, don't get this one...It's plot has really nothing to do with the Rocky Horror Picture, but many of the character's names are taken from the Rocky Horror Picture show's towns people.Some people say the movie grows on you each time you watch it, I'm sure that's because the wardrobe and set take you in and the plot may make more sense maybe after watching it over and over, I would go nuts if I had to watch it over and over, the plot is dumb...and doesn't hold water...if there is even a plot."
1,Is 0 stars possible?,"Is there a point to this movie? Or even a plot? This has to be the worst movie of all time. Well, at least my copy of shock treatment can be used as a standby tape to record episodes of my favorite soaps while I'm at work. ST deserves no stars at all!"
4,Classic of it's Time,"This book explains an easy history lesson along with somthing you'll want to read. Even though I history, it still teaches you alot. - Me"
3,nice mystery,"As much as I enjoyed this movie and the acting I have severalpoints:1) the wedding and funeral church musicalthough beautiful dates to 14th century not 12th?2) the costumes seem closer to a later period as wellThis period is the early Norman 12th or 13th century, beforemuch of the clothing technology of the middle east had reached Englandand Europe. Trumpet sleeves in women dresses,and pointed toe men shoeswith men in short tunics and hose is what the web suggests,with common folk mush less embellished.Well, the result was a good representation of at least later England.The plot of an arranged marriage for wealth seems to bemuch what one would expect, but courtly love too was a laterinvention of the epic poems sung by troubadours.The murders are for wealth and for revenge, butwell thought out."
4,nothing new but it was amusing...,The movie is nothing new and it is very predictable. It's about a girl's fatal attraction to a teacher. I enjoyed Rose McGowen's preformance and did get a chuckle about the bug spray smell in the attic. My only complaint is that it would have been nice to see what exactly she did to her friend.
4,Devil in the Flesh,"Talk about the student having an obsession on a teacher! This girl is crazy from the get. I liked this movie, but I usually like thrillers. This is one to keep in your DVD collection if you like thriller/suspense type movies. I'm glad I bought it."
2,B-Movie Material,"While Rose's acting was okay, the rest of the cast was suspect. Maybe just my copy but the special effect sounds were terrible also. None of them mimicked what you're seeing on the screen. This is best proved when the police motorcycle crashes....and the one-on-one basketball scene will crack you up with all the overly choreographed cheering.....c'mon people! But then again, what should be expected from a typical B-movie.So unless you have some time to kill and no more than a buck to spend, don't bother."
2,Devil in the trash!!!,"OMG this movie is awful! I love B thrillers and horror, but this one was just beyond terrible. I love Rose, but even she couldn't save this movie. The clothes she wore and the awful one-liners she had to say, yuck! If you are a fan a Rose and feel like you have to see this, rent before you buy, you'll thank me later!"
5,EXCELLENT THRILLER!,LOVED ALEX MCARTHUR'S PERFORMANCE - ONE OF THE BEST ACTORS OF THE 90'S. KEEP UP WITH THE GOOD WORK ALEX!
1,Rose is a good actress but this movie was not for her.,I bought the movie on accout Rose was on the cover. I got home and watched and in the end I was disappointed and in tears. This movie is not for people under eighteen cause of some of the stuff she does
3,A Great Drama/Thriller,"This movie was very entertaining. It involves a seemingly normal teenage girl who's personality suddenly takes an evil, violent turn into murder and insanity. Her strict and abusive grandmother and menacing classmates just make it worse for her. She becomes obsessed with her writing teacher and tries to win him over from his wife. But her jealousy just makes her more evil and psychotic. I found the scene where she destroys her grandmother's holy statues and bibles offensive since I am Catholic. That was un-called for, I don't care how powerful the movie was supposed to be, that was a sick thing to have in a movie. The scene where she murders her grandmother's dog was sick too. However, the rest of the movie was great."
2,Quite a typical movie.,"I've seen this movie twice. While I don't find it to be that good, it's still got an interesting moment or two to it. It reminds me of The Crush with Alicia Silverstone to a degree. The lady that plays the disturbed girl's grandmother did a good job in her role. When all has been said and done though, this movie isn't original or groundbreaking. Devil in the Flesh isn't completely poor, but it isn't very satisfying either (only mildly entertaining). Watch it if there's nothing else on."
3,T&A Flick 100%!,"While this movie sucked, I really enjoyed the view of the women in it, if you know what I mean! The plot and everything seemed good, but it just didn't seem original (cuz it's not!). My advisory is.... turn the volume off and enjoy the lucious views of the women."
4,I love Rose Mcgowan!,"This movie could best be described as being in the middle of a really bad movie and a really good movie. I think the difference is all in the film quality and lack of character development. There are no hollywood recipes for success here which makes it all the better.This is not the type of movie that most people would pay attention to, but if you apreciate bmovies and the like, you will apreciate this one. It's like a well made bmovie, yea, thats it."
5,Awesome,The book by R. Bryce was beautifully written. I personally recommend it for anyone with a desire to learn the true nature behind the rise and fall of the empire known as Enron.
1,The Foward by Molly Ivans should be a clue,"The fact that an alleged business book has a forward by Molly Ivans lets you know that this book will be more political and slanted than others. I could care less about politics which is why I found this book so dissapointing. Despite the fact that Enron thrived under the Clinton era, Bryce seems obsessed with slamming Bush. So instead of information on the actual causes of the Enron debacle we have endless Bush bashing which for even non Bush fans (like myself) ruins the whole reason for reading this book. Unless you like Political satire, stay clear of this disaster of a book."
5,On Fire!,All of the dancers are fabulous and the title is appropriate. I think all of the dancers are exceptionally talented but I'm always partial to Jillina because I was inspired to try bellydancing because of her. But I love the styles of Ansuya and Rania as well who are both so different from Jillina. Truly entertaining.
4,A great summary of the sounds of Techno!,"I've listened to this CD numerous times and i love it. Each song has a different type of techno, but each one has the basic tunes of techno. I like all the songs, and commend all of the artists. It has a lot of good artists and if you like techno you'll love this."
2,I just didn't love it.,"I ordered this because I heard good things about using clay on your hair but this just didn't do much for my fine, thin hair."
1,"Suspense - NO, horror - NO, Boring - DEFINATLY!!","This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I kept watching it hoping, thinking that the scares were only a scene away, they never came. If you could die from boredom, I would be. Save yourself the pain of death-by-boredom, and pass this one up."
2,SOMEWHERE THERE'S A PLOT,"Writer/director Ian Merrick's DEMON WITHIN is full of such gaping plot holes and inconsistent motivations that it ends up being nothing more than a mishmash of derivative horror cliches. Jeff Fahey, usually a sturdy presence in films, is outrageously awful in the role of Matthew Dobie, who has obviously been both a priest and a stage actor of ""great"" renown? Katie Wright as our heroine, Sarah, seems to be psychic as she manages to create busts of the murder victims. And somewhere out of the clear blue sky, her professor (Patrick Bauchau) decides she's the target of an Incubus..and his enlightenment comes from a crossword puzzle. Where did he even consider this? The one good thing is the musical score, which combines techno pop with choral vocals reminiscent of THE OMEN. But, that's it....this is coherent, ultimately boring and an ending that comes as a total downer."
5,Everyday Set,Keep it ready for those everyday words to look up. Computer is faster but to have a set of books in your hand to look up and use is still the best. Can read other words and information while you are there. Every child should have one on her/his desk for quick and easy references for their writing. Everyone should have a set. Not enough building of words in our lives today.
3,Thesaurus is useless!,"I bought this to get an all in one for college use. The tesauraus isn't even a thesaurus but more of a bad dictionary. You look up a word and all it tells you is a quick definition and to see: something. Well you go to that other word, get a quick definition and you have to see: something else. I was looking for- look up a word and here are my options of other words instead of my word. That is what a thesaurus is supposed to be. That is my biggest issue with this set. The dictionary is pretty good but I would have prefered it in a hard cover. Kind of kicking myself for not getting it bigger, more the size of a kids text book over a romance novel. Kind of thought they would be bigger actually. Vocabulary builder is kind of neat. All and all the price is decent but I would not recommend this set. Spend a little more money and get better ones and a REAL thesaurus!!! That bugged me. I need a thesaurus, I use my phone instead."
4,Great Set of books!,"I bought this set of books to help me write my own books. They are a great tool that I use almost everyday. These books are a great help in using different words to describe nouns, and to spice up a sentence. The vocabulary builder is great. It has groups of words that are similar in meaning or root words. It has learning quizes after every section. It is very helpful. I am very proud of my increased vocabulary thanks to this. It is a worthy purchase, I am glad that I bought this collection of books. They are easy to use, and are small enough to fit on a bookshelf with ease. The print is small so crack out your glasses if you need them. Other than that I have no issues with these books."
3,Merriam-Webster Language Reference Set,"Truly, for an old set of eyes, this Merriam-Webster set does not have acceptable print. I kept them but they are not for old eyes."
5,Great desk set,I love this set! It is small yet attractive on the desk and the vocabulary building book is fun when you have a few minutes to spare
5,Must have dictionary set!,I ordered this box set because I'm a language enthusiast (apart from being a teacher and a student) and it was totally worth it!Love the packaging and the colour combination as well!It is perfect as a present or to have at home when needed!AWESOME!
5,Merrriam-Webster's Everyday Language Reference Set,I brought htis item for my daughter for College. She is finding this very useful especially the Thesaurus when rying to find words to help with projects that needs certain letters in the words. The same is with the Dictionary if we don't find it their we use the Thesaurus. The whole set was more than we expected. Thanks
5,Excellent service and product!,"I ordered this for my grandaughter, who has very little space in her dorm room for her books. This smaller set was perfect."
4,Handy and useful,I bought this for my friend who are preparing the GRE test. The three books together can really help to the vocabulary and writing.
3,River of Gold CD,Purchased the CD to have a tranquil sound while I was cooking in the kitchen I was somewhat disappointed. I liked only one song.
5,Wine Saver,I have used this item in the past and need to order replacements only because in my house we all drink diferent types of wine and this saves us from having to dispose of left over old wine.I love this product.The wine tastes as good as the 1st time I open it weeks later!It was recieved days after ordered!
2,Not the best Wayne movie,"This is about the poorest directed movie John Wayne ever acted in. There are long moments without any background music, or background noise, which makes the actors seems like the are acting in a movie set, not performing real life like. During serious events in the movie, one or two of the characters will be laughing. We felt like the movie was just an avenue for the good looking women in the movie to be introduced to movie goers. Over all, this is not a very entertaining movie. It is nothing like Rio Bravo, or El Dorado. Nothing like them. I will not watch this movie a second time, and would not recommend it."
5,Gift for the Ol' man,My stepfather was very happy with this film of John Wayne's he's been wanting this one for along time and now he finally has it on dvd.
5,The Duke goes to the dentist in Wolf river....,"This is a great western that is different enough from Rio Bravo and Eldorado to make it worthwhile for John Wayne fans--especially on blu-ray....the sonic spread on the 5.1 mix is very narrow, but the picture is pretty darn good....the story is decent, with great scenery and John Wayne....and Jack Elam....fantastic...."
4,Rio Lobo purchased through Amazon,The movie Rio Lobo was purchased through Amazon. It arrived in excellent shape and in a very timely manner. I would recommend this purchase to others that are interested.
1,Sad ending for Director Hawks,"OK, I didn't know when viewing that the leading ladies were not actresses. I assumed they were girl friends of somebody putting up the money. Any high school drama teacher could have done a better job with the actors -- I refuse to believe Hawks was on the set at any time the scenes we saw were shot."
4,Hawk's last western.,"Not quite as good as Rio Bravo and El Dorado, Hawk's last western is still quality material and recommendable because of story-line and the presence of Wayne and Elam. Jorge Rivero and Christopher Mitchum make very weak sidekicks but the girls are a delight to watch! Although slightly disappointing compared to Rio Bravo and El Dorado still worth buying. 3 and a half star!"
5,Rio Lobo,As a fan of John Wayne it is exelent and it only leaves a couple of titles that a couple of titles that i want to complete the serries
3,Hawks' Cinematic Farewell,"Though partially cut from the same cloth as ""Rio Bravo"" and ""El Dorado,"" Howard Hawks' ""Rio Lobo"" (1970) remains a solid Western and a fitting end to the veteran director's career. With a ""comfortable"" John Wayne back in the saddle, the film is highlighted by impressive action sequences and splendid comic relief from Jack Elam. Apart from Jorge Rivero (who establishes a nice rapport with the Duke), the younger actors are a bit weak - and it's a shame that Robert Mitchum was unable to co-star with Wayne as originally planned. ""Rio Lobo"" may not represent Hawks' best work, but it's a lot of fun."
5,Love John Wayne,Trying collect all of John Wayne movies ... didn't have this one and it is great. Love the Duke in any movie..
1,Just Awful!,"The opening sequence in RIO LOBO -- the hi-jacking of a Union train during the Civil War -- is a very well done set-piece. However, from there on, this film becomes an embarrassment. It is truly awful! Poorly written, acted, directed. George Plimpton, who had a bit role in it, had the best comment: I didn't have the faintest idea what it was about. That's because it wasn't about anything, George."
1,Started off promising....,"This one starts off great w/ a train robbery but then flickers out light a used candle. The Duke was paired with co-stars who seemed to know nothing about the dialect or mannerisms of the old west. Their acting styles made them great candidates for guest spots on ""The Love Boat"" or ""Charlies Angels"". The two girls were quite the hotties but out of place in this flix. Im wondering who the target audience was. All in all, worth seeing once for the train robbery but don't even think of buying this one."
2,Rio Lobo,"This is probably the worst movie John Wayne made, although Christopher Mitchum went on to a funny roll in Big Jake."
3,Three Stars,"Quite a confused story: one minute we are in London, the next minute we are on the moon. However, one believes these segues will not bother children. One also believes that Hughes is the master at knowing what a child's imagination will engage with.Hughes makes liberal use of vampire mythology - Ffangs the vampire wants to be a human being - without adverting to its basis in damnation and corrupt sexuality. Perhaps children would want to know about these adult aspects of the mythology notwithstanding Hughes cavalier or emancipated attitude."
2,THIER WORST,THIS CD IS NOT ALL THAT GREAT. I REALLY DONT LIKE THE SOUL. USALLY THEIR SONGS ARE NICE AND UPLIFING. THIS CD IS NOT THAT. I THINK THAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER AND THEY HAVE DONE BETTER. SO IF I WAS YOU DONT BUY IT IT IS NOT REALLY ALL THAT GREAT PEACE AND GOD BLESS YOU
2,Way Overpriced,This all plastic regulator doesn't hold a candle to the brass one it's replacing.Foolish of me to think it would give a leak tight seal without the use of plumber's tape.
4,works but there is a hole in it,seems to be deliberately placed there.. don't know if its a pressure relief hole or what since there are no instructions or anything on the package.
3,Parts,I have this one as a backup. I have not used it yet. I keep it stored in the RV for future use.
5,I think you can open the door if you really want to. I did.,"This is the last of the 3 cd's I have by K Freston, and I think the most interesting. It's all about creating abundance in your life, not just wealth but any kind, and it really opens up a lot of doors. Or more truthfully, shows you how to open them for yourself. I've always had a hard time actually accepting living well with a clear conscience, and this guided meditation showed me why I felt that way and how to open that block up. It doesn't give 'answers' per se, but brings you to your own. Things Have gotten better for me, steadily, since I began this, and I think a lot of it has to do with my new ways of thinking. I'd definately recommend this cd, along with the Daly Dose, and the Relationship cd. I couldn't be more pleased.S.J."
3,Valuable but rigid,"Helpful information about the concept of mantram. Interesting explanations, though some are contradicted by other sources. Methodology is rigid. Rigidity aside, a valuable read."
4,Not quite as nice as it used to be,"This perfume was discontinued a few years ago, but I have still faithfully been ordering it from Amazon. Unfortunately this time I could definitely tell that the product is older; the color is not quite right and the scent doesn't last as long.That being said, I still love this perfume and wish RL would start producing it again!"
5,great movie,this is a wonderful movie that he whole family can enjoy. owning a conure myself i found it especially amusing. this movie will make you laugh and in the next minute make u tear up. an overall great movie
5,More than just a kids movie!,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time... and I am an adult with no kids! The movie is about so much more than a funny parrot... its really about the journey of life and all of Paulie's experiences along the way including heartbreak, betrayal, and pure joy! To quote Ivy from the movie... ""Maybe we shouldn't ask ourselves when we will get there... but what do we want to see along the way!"" True fun and laughter included!"
4,A wonderful surprise,"I saw this movie on a lark and loved it. It has great cameos: what other movie has Buddy Hacket, Gene Roweland and Cheech. I was totally surprised to find myself crying at the end. If you find yourself aching to fill that hole in your life, you could join the Peace Corps or you could watch Paulie and get on with your life. What? You don't think that will help you? Then purchase Paulie and watch it over and over again until it has changed you for the better and then go out into the world and act on that change. Consider it."
5,It's Paulie!,I saw this movie years ago with my son and thought it was such a cute story then & still do.
2,UNABLE TO REVIEW THIS ITEM-DESIGNED FOR AREA 2-EUROPE ONLY,I am not able to review this properly due to the fact that this version of the DVD is designed for viewing in area 2-which I believe is Europe only-I notified the company that I purchased this from and have not heard a word from them yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Decent family fare,"While ""Paulie"" can be endearing and has moments of enchantment, it follows a formula so old that it's more than a bit frayed around the edges. A little girl is separated from a beloved pet. The pet has many adventures trying to find the little girl. He is finally caught by a team of scientists, who the formula dictates nust be insensitive and mad. A sensitive employee with a low paying job saves Paulie. The inevitable happy ending follows.Of interest to me is that the director, John Roberts, has just one other film to his credit. This is the marvelous family film, ""The War of the Buttons"" [1994].Paulie looks very realistic, except when he flies. When he does this, it looks like he's being moved around on a string.There is a plot twist at the end, which adults will already have figured out, but which will surprise children."
1,Not a happy customer,"I ordered this movie for a Christmas gift and was not happy to find out that I was sold a DVD that doesn't work in the U.S. Why someone would sell me a DVD that is clearly being used in the U.S. when their product does not work in the U.S. I do not know. On top of that, I contacted the seller and they have yet to contact me back. I am not happy with this service."
1,TO BAD THERE ISNT A 0,BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THIS DESERVES. THIS MOVIE IS TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DEPRESSING!
5,For everyone,"It's one of those kiddie story that everybody likes. Like Bugs Bunny or a xmas special... I can watch it over and over, it's still amusing. A story in the real and old fashion way... probably like your grand'ma told you when you were a kid!"
5,paulie come back home!!!!,all i have to say is that this is a great movie but sometimes emotional after seeing the scene where he learns to fly twice i still cry buy this movie go paulie!!!!
5,Paulie,"Paulie is a family friendly film. It is a film of hope, love and wisdom. A love story of a little girland the parrot Paulie that changed her life. Beautifulwould recommend it highly. Have viewed it 10 times so far. Each time I learn another lesson and am soinspired. Tony Shalob (Monk) is awesome in his portrayal of a Russian immigrant. Recommend it highly."
3,"Something's Burnin'...and missin""","I am enjoying the music, first heard on eight track in 1970. The quality is good and the haunting refrains of Rogers and Camacho bring tears and produce goosebumps...but, the album is woefully incomplete materially with the absence of the plaintiff ballad, ""Mama's Waiting""...a hand's down, slam dunk, piling-on FIVE if the album only contained this song."
1,Not a very helpful guide book,"I found this book to be unwieldy and not very well organized. Hundreds of colleges are described in detail, but many are not. Part of the book looks to be printed on recycled paper, and part is on whiter paper. I got better information going online to colleges I was interested in than I got from this book. Save your money!"
2,Poor Quality,"The mouse works fine. The keypad is pretty much crap. The rubber anti-skid things on the bottom came off the first time I used it and the plus and minus keys no longer work. I haven't even tried all of the keypads functions yet to see if they work, as I've only had it about 2 weeks. I'm returning it.I do like however, that both the mouse and keypad have an auto off feature after a short period of not being used."
3,"Keypad works good, mouse is junk","The mouse that came with my kit was a piece of junk. It walked all over the place when not in use. This was not only very annoying, but it caused the keypad not to work. The other annoying thing is that the mouse has to be constantly turned back on / reset. If you dont use it for 3 minutes or so, it shuts off. Once I threw away the mouse, the keypad works great. The mouse gets 1 star and the keypad gets 4 stars. If it was bluetooth, then it would get 5 stars."
2,Jumpy mouse and too small keypad,"I have used other wireless keypads and mice before, but these are not up to the quality and usability of prior purchases. The keypad is smaller than a normal keypad and the key placement of the primary function keys is unusual for someone who normally can 10-key by touch. For some reason the mouse is really ""jumpy"". when I plug it in it jumps all around the page, but will eventually settle down after it gets ""tapped"" a few times. All in all, I think I got what I paid for as this was much cheaper than others."
4,Good product,The Kensington Wireless Notebook Keypad and Mouse combo is an excellent product. The keypad has extensive calculator functions and both are excellent for anyone who has a laptop. The only disappointment was that the mouse is a bit small (about half the size of a regular mouse) - it would be well-suited for the hands of a child but is a bit clumsy in the hands of an adult. It's great that both products have an off feature which allows for extending the battery life. I highly recommend this product.
2,Not what I expected...,"I expected to see a comedy, but I got a musical instead. And it wasn't even an amusing musical either. It did have good acting performances all around, but the story was very predictable (used to be impossible for a Coen movie!!). Also disappointing was the plot - it was supposed to be about 3 escaped convicts on a quest for buried treasure, but that couldn't have been farther from what really went on (didn't want to put any spoilers there).I give it 3 out of 10, for the acting alone."
3,Oh Brother!,Having seen clips of this film I had to rent it as soon as it came out on DVD. Sadly I was disappointed. The acting was great - I didn't know George Clooney could look so unattractive(!) - but the storyline was thin and slow moving. My greatest memory of the film was the song 'I'm a Man of Constant Sorrow' - both performances (although lip-synched) are gems and about the funniest parts of the whole film.
2,"Homer?...Homer Simpson, maybe...","I liked all the actors, but sorry, the premise didn't work...No way did they evoke the right mood and the combination of classical language and crackers was laughable, not enjoyable...Oh well..."
3,Where is Nicholas Cage When You Need Him?,"I wanted so much to love this film, like I love the bulk of the C-Brothers' films. But I have to be honest, after the first half hour or so, I no longer accepted George Clooney in that lead role. He is not edgey enough for dark humor, oddball humor, satire, farce, and general off-center weirdness. Admit it, you were envisioning Nicholas Cage in that role, too, weren't you?"
2,"Personally, I really didn't like this movie.","Maybe I don't like it because I was forced to see it. Then again, I rented out of free will and I still hated it. One of my friends fell asleep during the movie because it was so boring. The best parts were the parts with the Soggy Bottom Boys and the credits. Now that you have my opinion I hope you might just think a little more about buying this movie, unless you really, really like it. Remember: rent before you buy, unless you saw it in theaters. Also, just because you're friends like it dosn't mean you'll like it."
2,There thou art!,"I was majorly disappointed in this movie. I had rented it because lots of folks touted the bluegrass aspect, which I did enjoy and therefore gave it 2 stars. But, after George Clooney (Dan Tyminski) sang at the radio station the movie just went down hill. When the scene with the cows getting run over arrived I almost decided to turn it off, but my teenaged nephew asked to watch a bit more. However, things just got more disappointing after that and we ended up turning it off before it finished. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Why suffer through the movie when you can just listen to the CD?"
2,haha... wait... i'm lost....,"If you are planning to have a nice night, with a good movie, I don't think you should pick 'O Brother Where Art Thou'. Its pretty funny, but there was really no plot. In one scene the 3 fugitives see these ladies who start singing and seducing them. In my teenage perspective, I don't want to see some old dudes being seduced by beautiful women. (George Clooney is hot though) I was laughing a lot of the time, but I did not understand this at all. Every couple of minutes I was like, where did this dude come from? My mom and I were in tears we were laughing so hard after the movie was over, cuz we didn't get it AT ALL. Especially the whole flood thing... if you just want a laugh without the annoyance of actual substance, then this is the movie for you!"
3,NOT THEIR BEST FILM,"The destination for this road-film is too sketchy to provide much structure, and the three traveling protagonists are too shallow for drama but too flat for silly humor of the Dumb and Dumber variety. The Coen brothers (never known for subtlety) overdo the film's Southern Gothic elements, diminishing its effectiveness. By trying to make almost everyone in Mississippi look like sideshow freaks, the film provides no foils for its strange protagonists. The film explicitly acknowledged its debt to the Odyssey, but the various allusions to the epic poem serve no other purpose than to let the viewer smugly congratulate himself for recognizing them. It's not a boring or bad film, and the music is excellent, but this is not a must-see Coen brothers film."
1,[Crud],The only good thing about this entire movie is the song by the Soggy Bottom Boys called Sorrow..Don't rent it...dont' watch it at a friends house
1,Fargo - this isn't,Another reviewer mentioned that he was lost in the first 20 minutes. I wasn't lost but I kept asking myself -- O Brother why did I waste my money on this?Sure the characters were witty at times and the plot definitely abstract -- but does that make a good overall movie. Not in my opinion.
1,Possibly my worst movie of all times,"OH what a shame! This cannot be from the same brothers who did Fargo, the Big Lebowski and Arizona! THIS IS SIMPLY BAD CINEMAThe actors recite their lines as automats while poorly faking a southern accent from God knows where, the alleged storyline as a parallel with the Odyssey is simply ludicrous, and the miserable old Hollywood cliches about the South and Southerners are all there (idiots, dirty, KKK lovers, blindly religious, etc. - the KKK ""ballet"" [I am not kidding, they actually ... dance!] is particularly idiotic).Two things get this movie one miserable star: the sometimes stunning scenery and the music.Bottom line: get a good or better scenery somewhere else, and buy the soundtrack, you'll save money and you'll learn about good traditional southern music."
1,Disappointed,"I guess I just don't ""get it."" After all the hype, I found the plot tedious and was waiting for it to actually go somewhere. I was so disinterested, I quit watching it before it was over. Fortunately for me, I had rented it instead of buying a theater ticket or buying the DVD."
2,This Movie is O.K,No the people who hate this movie are not stupid we just all do not like the same things.... O Brother Where art thou is an average film with a average soundtrack nothing too special. I was suprised with the rave reviews that this movie was getting I truly did not see the magic at all. My advice is this O brother stuff is not for everybody. If you like Old 1930's style america then O brother is probably is for you and good for you if you like it. The same is for the soundtrack I do not really care for the music but since I am 19 years old maybe that is only normal. O brother is O.K but not a memorable hit....
2,oh coen where art thou?,"All the hype, all the love, all the critics - Come on. This movie was one thing, and one thing only. Boring. Maybe it was because it was after a long day at work when I watched this, but I couldn't really get into it - it had some wry humor, but overall, I never laughed out loud even once. It was like watching 2 hours of a Days of Our Lives dream sequence - there was no beginning or end, just blah.I prefer Homer's Odyssey. Please Coens, keep to your own stuff."
2,booorrrrring,"I love movies. I'm the person who comes out of the movie that's left everyone else gagging and says ""what? I kind of enjoyed it."" This bored me."
2,"Big Dissapointment, Did not Laugh out loud once.","I really like The Cohen brothers movies but I did not laugh out loud once during this movie.One of their least impressive works.I really wanted to like this movie but I was not inspired at all. One of those movies you neither love nor hate,which I hate! Get The Big Lebowski instead.Now that is a funny movie!"
3,'Dumb & Dumber' Meets 'Song of the South',"I must say I did smile throughout the entire showing of ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" I am not certain if the smile was amusement, amazement, animosity, or just plain disbelief that I bought the movie, and would now own it forever, rather than simply renting it, at which point I would be able to return it to the rental place, having seen it once, which I must say is enough.The music is TERRIFIC!! The scenery is beautiful. The story has great potential. Clooney is not, perhaps, cut out for a film career, though he sure does look great. I suggest you RENT this movie. That way you can tell your friends, ""Oh ya, I saw that...the music was great, huh."", and yet you will not be burdened, my friend, with the ownership of a film such as this.KAYCEYGIRL RENTAL ONLY!!"
5,So much fun!,"One of my all time favorites! George Clooney at his best. If you are looking for a good giggle, check this gem out!"
5,Love it love it love it!,"We purchased this movie as a replacement for one we bought when the movie first came out. Somebody ""borrowed"" our copy and didn't return it. (When will my husband learn not to lend stuff?????) We love this movie, watch it at least a couple of times a year (and we very seldom watch a movie more than once!)--love the music, the humor, George Clooney in the oddest (for him) and most fun role he has ever played, and his two sidekicks are hoots! All the characters are unique and essential to the story--all played by excellent actors. Every time we watch it we see something new. Also, if you want a movie or a book, Amazon.com is the best! They have always had what I was looking for in stock, at better prices than I can buy it locally, and it gets to me very quickly, even if I don't pay extra to have it shipped extra fast. When I really want something, I go to Amazon.com."
5,Superb entertainment,"This movie is such great fun to watch! Don't take it seriously and have fun and it will become one of your favorite 10 movies of all time. The reviewer that is concerned about the cows getting shot; well PLEASE read the credits, ""No animals were harmed..."" Same goes for the shot that looks like a cow gets hit by Baby Face Nelson's car. These were computer generated effects, people!! And the poor reviewer that made the ""Green Acres"" comment, well, sir, you simply don't get it! Great fun to watch and fascinating to listen to, great ""Old Timey"" music and the soundtrack is STILL in the top ten on the country music charts. Don't miss this movie!"
4,Very good entertainment,"Don't expect the Odyssey, but expect a very clever movie. Lot's of fun and you'll enjoy seeing it over and over. The entire cast is incredible, and the songs linger in your mind for days afterward. I bought the CD as well as the DVD, just to be able to listen to it in my car.My wife enjoyed it as much as I did, which really surprised me. She was doubtful, at first, but barely into the film she was hooked. She enjoyed the bluegrass music too, and she has never cared for that type of sound before.Although it's not THE Odyssey, it is AN odyssey, a winding story-adventure. I was surprised that George Clooney could pull it off. Some of the lip-synching was off, with the voice not matching the character. All in all, we found it a very good movie, and still watch it from time to time."
3,strangely fascinating,This movie follows in the footsteps of Raising Arizona and Fargo. Cult following comes to mind when I think of it. Either you will love it or hate it. There are so many one-liners that can be hung on to that it requires rewatching the movie to capture and save them. George Clooney shows his diversity once again. Hope you like bluegrass!
4,Relax!,"While seeing this movie, a feeling of relaxation came onto me. We see three men escaping from prison (time setting somewhere around 1920) and start looking for their fortune. This brilliant movie (Joel and Ethan Coen, director and writer brothers, made Blood Simple and other great movies) does not explain much to the viewer, but gives you time to enjoy the adventures of these simple minded guys. And that's where Relax! comes in - there's no need to hurry to the plot because there isn't one. After half an hour I started to suspect that this is the truth, no plot? And shortly after that I realized: no problem because it's just a lot of fun. It is a crazy story, with crazy guys. Beautifully shot, nice performances and great props. There are some people in the movie that have to be as crazy as they appear on screen - I couldn't believe my eyes sometimes.Have some time off and laugh your socks off with O Brother!"
5,Twisted Humor - The Perfect Coen Brother's Movie,There isn't much to say about O Brother Where Art Thou. It was crazy and absolutely hilarious. Clooney was very funny and the Coen Brothers did a phenomenal job with its production. I've never laughed this hard at twisted humor like this. Its one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!!!!!!
3,I'm a Closet Fan,I refused to see this at the theater because I thought it would degrate Southerns. Once I saw it at a friend's house I changed my mind. It's one of those movies that you notice something new each time. Now I enjoy it by myself because I don't want to admit to my boyfriend that I was wrong!
5,"Part of Americana, authentic and enjoyable!","One of the best movies I have seen in a LONG time. Hysterical, a must see. One that you HAVE to buy for the simple pleasure of seeing it again. The more you see it the better it gets. The music is good too!"
3,"I loved the theatrical release, but...","... whoever produced the DVD fixed somethin' that weren't broke by deleting the Welch/Krauss rendition of ""I'll fly away"", that hair-raisin' duet with full bluegrass backup that got everybody all a-lather. They dubbed in some generic back-porch ensemble instead, and my ears near fell off from surprise.The pinch-hit group do just okay, and I'm not slamming their artistry, but their music was not what I'd expected or paid for. At least Ms. Welch's acting cameo stayed in.I wish they'd checked the copyright wonks and IP lawyers at the door when they did the DVD. This edition is okay but just beware that it's NOT what you saw or heard in the theater, and IMO is a misleading and inferior product. A pity that opened DVDs are generally non-returnable."
5,This is a Technical Review.,"I first tried to play this DVD on my computer. Unfortunately, the computer's DVD player wouldn't accept it & told me to ""Lower"" the Dvd Resolution. I then tried it on my DVD player/VCR in my lounge. Needless to say that it played & I really enjoyed the DVD. Incidentally, I live in Manurewa Auckland New Zealand.I found the sound track on an on-line music site; loved the music so much that I hunted for & purchased the DVD. It was out of distribution in New Zealand so I had to go ""off-shore"".I found it to be a grass roots DVD & not everybody would appreciate the music showcased in the film. ie: It is aimed at an audience that likes the Southern States culture & music of the 1930s.This Reviewer enjoys the type of music showcased in the movie, so gave it a five(5) Star rating."
4,"An oddball, but good!","If you want to see something out of the ordinary, something which will take your mind off of the atrocities of today, watch this movie.George Clooney proved that he is not just a pretty face. He can act and act well. Even his country accent is on the mark.He reflects a boyish wonder throughout the whole movie. Yet, you know that he is in charge all the time.John Goodman has a colorful part in this movie, too. He is a bible salesman who is anything but christian. He plays his part very well. He was a good choice.Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou is a wonderful movie. It keeps you watching and wondering what these three fools will do next.The music is very good, too. Especially, the song that Clooney's character becomes famous for. I really like that song and it's not my kind of music.Watch this movie. It won't be a waste of time! You will have a BONAFIDE good time."
3,"Had it's moments, but not momentous.","The music was fantastic. The cinematography well deserved the nomination it received. However, Clooney's character was borderline grating. Solid scenes nestled between stretches of mediocre ones that soured the grapes. This averaged to an overall rating of 3. The movie had classic potential but fell off the wagon. Director Joel Coen has greater successes ahead."
5,Good Movie!,"Hi, I'm 11 yrs old, and I watchedthis movie with my parents and believe it ornot, I loved it!! My parents really liked it too!!I recommend this movie, its funny and has greatmusic!"
2,Disappointment,I am a fan of previous Coen brother films. Thought I would enjoy this one - wrong. Had to stop the film half way (which I rarely do) because it was too drawn-out and boring.
3,Good fim but generally over-rated by the press & Hollywood,"This film is a ""Coenized"" version of Homer's Odyssey which takes place in the American south. It is a movie about a man's journey back home and along the way Ulysees (Everett) played by George Clooney encounters sirens and a cyclops.The structure of the film isn't as cogent as their previous films however it is very well crafted in terms of cinamatography and especially the music.A slightly above average film and not as good as you might expect it to be -- unless Hillbilly music is your thing."
1,Stupid movie,If you want to insult your intelligence buy and watch this stupid movie. I found no value in this movie
1,Wrong format,"DVD was for European DVD players. Why would any one sent this format to an American address? Why, Why Why?"
3,O Brother,I ordered this thinking it was DVD I did not take time to notice this. I did get it fast it was in great shape. Although I do not have a VHS anymore I will keep it and let other watch it.
4,all-around fun,"in general, this is an all-around fun movie to watch, with a fantastic plot, and great acting and music. in fact, the music essentialy makes this movie, so i suggest you find yourself the cd as well.."
3,O Brother on Bluray,"Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, but the Bluray gets jerky near the end of the movie. None of my other Blurays do this. I would really like to exchange it.Otherwise, delivery was prompt and it came in good shape!"
4,"Blue-ray O Brother, Where Art Thou?",It was puchased as a Christmas present for my Father who throughly enjoyed it! Are there any simular related films available? Thanxs
4,A Modern Telling of the Odyssey,"The Coen Brothers bring us a unique and humorous retelling of the Odyssey in O Brother Where Art Thou ? Instead of the mythologized characters made famous in the Odyssey the monsters are human most notably the one eyed bible salesmen played by John Goodman acting as a human Cyclopes and the unscrupulous man who tried to steal Ulysses family from him. In order to regain his family, Ulysses must battle both the human monsters of the modern world and the monsters contained in nature still exist between floods and intense rains. Throughout the journey home, the escaped group of convicts encounter obstacles that nod toward the historical roots of The Odyssey from the previously mentioned Cyclopes to the Sirens...a group of very attractive women who hypnotize one of the prisoners leaving him without clothes. Overall an engaging, entertaining, and comedic adaptation of a literary classic."
4,Good Movie/ Good Music,I liked the movie. It was entertaining. The movie was delivered quickly and there was not damage.
5,amazing movie!,I 100% reccomend this movie to anyone and everyone. It was funny with a great plot and amazing music! i had to buy the soundtrack on the way home from the theater!
4,An chaming on the road film filled with Great Music.,"Three 1920`s Convict Escapes (George Clooney, John Turturro & Tim Blake Nelson) from Jail steadfast on obtain to the Loot stashed departed by one of them. As this is at his home soon to be flooded by a new barricade, accelenate is of the substance. They find themselves fast-talking thier route out of one compress after another, and along the path not only contain be alert of riverside sirens but even get to make a elegant cheerful country tune.Directed by Joel Coen. Written by Ethan and Joel Coen. This is a well made film, very entertaining at best. Clooney, Turturro and Nelson delivers Terrific Comic Performances. DVD`s has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an Superb DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound). DVD is full of nice Extras expect Commentary from the Filmmakers or Crew and Deleted Scenes. This is an Instant Classic. Great Fun. Super 35. Grade:A-."
5,A rare cinematic odyssey,"You don't necessarily need to enjoy bluegrass, but it sure don't hurt because some of the finest bluegrass in the world is probably heard in this video. Norman Blake does a terrific rendition of ""You Are My Sunshine,"" and you'll find a real ""old timey"" sound coming from The Whites, The Cox Family, Allison Krauss, and other Newgrass artists. The movie is charming, gutsy, and hugely entertaining. George Clooney-- who happens to look remarkably like Clark Gable in this movie-- shows his talent for the comedic in his role as Ulysses Everett McGill, the smooth talker in the trio of escapees fleeing a chain gang in 1920s Mississippi. Adventures, escapades, and political predicaments follow hot on their recently-freed heels, and all of it is accompanied with unforgettable music. Buy the soundtrack if, for nothing else, the ""Soggy Bottom Boys'"" rendition of 'Man of Constant Sorrow.' O Brother is a treasure."
2,obrother where art thou,"The picture is quite clear but the sound is faint. Even at the maximum volume setting of 50, it is hard to hear for me."
1,DVD DOESN'T WORK IN THE USA,"This is a great movie, but if you read the small print you will see that this DVD is for Region Two.It will work fine on your DVD player if you live in Japan or Egypt but not if you live in the USA.Well there goes more money down the drain."
2,It was really nothing that good,O Brother Where Art Thou is one of those movies where alot like it and alot of people hate it. I am one who really did not like the movie. The plot did not pick up and little action occured and the parts got confusing. The scenery was really nice looking though but it was too long and boring and being in a room with 12 other people while this was on nobody laughed once. It just one those movies where it's music is really bad and the movie is bad too and it gets so many rave reviews and you just do not understand why.
2,Get a grip people,"Are you mad? I sat and watched this long, slow drawn out movie and started getting itchy pants. Nothing happens for what seems like hours. The dialogue is sometimes fast (Clooney), but always irritating. The story just goes on and on and on. I appreciate the references to literary classics, but this just doesn't do anything to add to the actual interest of the film. Miss it. Or if you do see it, write a review here, I would be interested to see if everyone else has been 'fooled' by the artistic content - it is a boring film. Period."
1,Major disappointment!,I tried hard to get through this movie. I found it lacking in humor. Frankly I found it lacking in everything. This the worst movie I have bought on DVD. It would not even make a good Frisbee.
1,Animal cruelty glorified,"Yes, I realize it is just a movie, but I don't find amimal cruelty funny. That is the scary thing about dark humor though - it makes it acceptable to laugh at such things. I should have known when I found out the people responsible for this mess had made Fargo (murder, ha ha). I tried to give this movie a chance because the soundtrack was done by people I liked but it was too disturbing and totally unentertaining for me, sorry."
3,"Music great, movie falls short","I absolutely loved the ""old timey music"", and I plan to go and buy some ""Old Timey"" CD's. However, the picture was disjointed, and I will have to admit that I never read Homer's Odyssey, so my review of the movie itself could be flawed, but that's how I saw it.I don't ever feel that George Clooney is ever believeable in anything he has done, from ER to this. He appears to be acting the part instead of being ""in"" the part, and being believable in his role."
3,Not exactly sophisticated,"I must say I'm a little surprised at how much others liked this film. It gave me a giggle but I can't say it really gave me any belly-laughs. George Clooney is George Clooney, a bit arrogant and self opinionated, not to say selfish to drag out of the prison two other crooks who had the misfortune to be chained to him although they only had a few weeks to do before being free with the temptation of sharing a 1.2$million booty which didn't really exist. Entertaining but not engrossing."
3,Beautiful but boring,"The costumes, the hair, the background, the settings...all fabulous! The colors were lush and warm, and completely appropriate to the story. But the story was slow and the characters frustrating. There was so little depth to any of the characters, that you didn't really care what happened to them next. This movie does showcase yet another facet of George Clooney's acting talents and if you're a George Clooney fan, you'll probably enjoy this one more because of it. The best part of the movie, however, was by far the singing! Soundtrack is full of wonderful, rich, sing-able songs. Rent the movie, buy the soundtrack."
3,"Oh, writers, where art thou?","This movie is a good example of why Hollywood needs to give screenwriters more respect. The actors are good, and each scene in isolation is well-done and funny. But the story is only hinted at, and the characters come off as cardboard stereotypes. Just a little more attention to the storytelling craft would have made this a magnificent movie.The movie is enjoyable to watch, as long as you do not have high expectations. Despite its flaws, I give the movie three stars because the scenes are enjoyable to watch."
2,"Worthwhile music, movie falls flat.","I think it's odd that the movie announces at the beginning that it's based on Homer's Odyssey, as the storyline barely follows in the theme of The Odyssey at all. The music is awesome and I reccomend the soundtrack, but honestly the movie didn't do it for me. Weak plot, annoying characters, lame ending. I just wasn't impressed at all."
4,Good Deal,Product came in condition described but I thought it took a little longer than I had expected to receive it. No major complaints.
5,Loved it!,"Being from the South, I was not in the least bit offended by the actions and speech in this movie. Actually, I would almost swear that I recognized some of the characters as being people here in town! Even though some people in other areas of the country may view the ""slang"" ""countrified"" speech as ignorance -- and maybe some of it is -- the movie characters portrayed in a hilarious fashion a way of life many years ago, and captured very well the naivete and unique speech of the South. Ignorant -- no. Simple -- yes. The music is also outstanding."
4,Not for everyone,"Very odd and funny, but be warned there is a lot of stuff said that isn't for delicate ears"
3,"Not what I was expecting, but still OK","I've been a Coen brothers fan for a while now, but this was a film I wasn't quite expecting from them. Overall, the movie was enjoyable. Homer's Odessey is a hard text to tackle, and I think they did it with their own flare. Most of the movie was good, I loved the Soggy Bottom Boys! If you are looking for the type of comedy that you are used to seeing from the Coen brothers, it won't be found here. The is not the Big Lebowski set in the south during the Depression."
4,One of the best 2 movies so far for 2001,"I rented this movie because I had seen an interesting preview on another DVD. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was! I love subtle humor but this is the best. I found myself laughing unexpectedly throughout the movie. When I watched selected scenes again, I laughed even harder! The facial expressions, dancing and spellings are priceless. I'm going to watch it again with my 15 year old sone. Definately a sleeper and definately a MUST BUY for your collection!"
5,R-U-N-N-O-F-T and see this movie!!,"Ok, I admit it, I only went to see this movie because I knew George Clooney was in it. Just seeing the very ""dapper"" Mr. Clooney on the big screen would have been enough reason for me to spend the money for a ticket. (He resembles the very handsome, Clark Gable in this movie) However, I loved the movie for oh so many more reasons. The music is simply amazing. In fact, I went out and bought the soundtrack (as soon as I left the theater) for my Dad for a Father's Day gift. This movie is hilarious too. Every actor in it does a fabulous job. The scenery, the history of it all, the urge I felt to run out & buy pomade & hairnets . . . anyway, this movie was great. You will not be disappointed."
4,Great,A must see. a tour de force. Audiences world wide must see this film. Some other hacks review line. Fin
3,Fun,"Fun Movie, great song, george clooney at his funniest, Holly Hunter over the top, Not much else to say about it"
4,Amazing,"I am 15 years old but I think that this movie thought me alot, it was very well written and the actors played there parts so well I felt that I was there. I believe that this movie taught me alot on religion( the devil) and on life in general . If anything I would recommend this movie to many people especially to my age groupe because it makes you think about different things that most of us don`t talk about . Whatch this movie once and you will like it so much you will alomost know the lines bu heart !!"
5,Beautiful filmmaking,"George Clooney continues to make a name for himself as a brillian leading man in this beautifully and lovingly filmed ""remake"" of the Odyssey. John Goodman is used to good effect (as usual) by the Coen brothers, and John Turturro and all the other supporting characters are just as funny, and probably a little bit more subtle, than you're used to seeing from a comedy these days.There are laughs throughout, and beautiful scenes. It's a nice juxtaposition of comedy and gorgeous filmmaking."
5,It's funny!,The old ones are the good ones! True in this case!Have watched it four times and we laugh our tailsoff each time. It's a great movie!
3,Very Likeable Movie,"This was an extremely likeable movie. It's not one of my all-time favorites, but it's a movie I'd enjoy watching again. Although there was really nothing extraordinary about the movie, it was very nicely done in many ways. The music was quite good (and I don't generally listen to blue grass or ""old timey"" kind of music). The characters were engaging. The atmosphere created was perfect for what I'd imagine the south was like during the time period portrayed in the movie. There was plenty of beautiful scenery. The movie was pretty much flawless, and although it may not be a great movie it is about as likeable as they come! (BTW, according to dictionary.com, likeable can also be spelled likable.)"
5,A definate SOUTHERN classic!...,"I loved the movie. Despite what other bad comments others have made about the film, I believe its a sure classic. I would really suggest that you make this a part of you DVD collection. Along with the great movie, one of the extras includes the music video of ""Man of Constant Sorrow."" Its great! I have two words for these reviewers picking this movie apart....CHILL OUT!... Just enjoy the movie for what it is, a light hearted, deep south comedy!If your a TRUE southerner, and enjoy shows like ""The Andy Griffith Show"" with southern humor, this is a must have!! Its one of those movies you'll watch over and over again!"
5,great comedy,"One of my favorite movies, it is a great comedy to watch. The actors are at their best in this one."
5,O BROTHER IS GREAT!,"I was pretty reluctant to watch ""O Brother"" in the first place, after being recommended to it from a friend. After i saw the movie however, i was SOOO satisifed. I absolutely LOVED this movie and i would recommend it to anyone. George Clooney is great as Everett and his comrads Pete and Delmar become instantly lovable by viewers of all ages. Not only is the movie funny, but it pulls of Homer's Odyssey like i never thought possilbe! This is truly a great film."
4,Brother it art here!,"While this movie is definitely not for the kids, it's a great movie. Never a dull moment! George Clooney at his unexpected best. You won't regret spending two hours to watch this flick. Got a hairnet?"
2,Dissapointing,"This just goes to show that I should never listen to hype and reviews on movies. This movie isn't even in the same league as one of their previous movies ""Fargo"", which I continue to watch and never get tired of. I found this movie boring, difficult to follow, and annoying. I guess I must have missed it's ""Deep meaning"" somewhere. Personally - I would have been dissapointed in the rental cost of this despite the fact that I actually purchased it."
5,blu ray dvd,received dvd in quick time - well wrapped and works good - excellent service to Australia - i buy all my dvd's from Amazon - never had a problem
1,"Boring, plotless, boringest!","""O Brother Where Art Thou or Adapted Classic Literature with Uninteresting Rednecks.""I gave it a shot for 45 minutes when it was on HBO. I got thoroughly bored and uninterested. Sorry, nothing more to say, as I remember nothing but the twiddling of my thumbs and looking at my watch."
1,Wont Play In our DVD Player,"This DVD will not play in our Sony HD Blue Ray Player.It will play on ONE of our computers nicely but the other one hasto be reconfigured to a different ""zone"" to play it.If you live in the US this product is not configured to play onyour equipment at all or without time consuming and frustrating adjustments.Maybe it was in the product description that this was a foreign disk andneeded special equipment but we did not see that."
2,"Just 'Oh, Brother!'","This movie appears to be a random mix of themes and genres. It's partly a narrative about Depression era life in the South, partly country-western musical, partly surreal fantasy, partly comedy, partly picaresque adventure, partly indictment of the Klu Klux Klan, partly Dickensian character study - well, the list could go on and on. The result is a scarecrow, a straw man covered in everybody's cast off clothes - out there flapping goofily in the field.No, I don't understand the point or praise of this one. If you like your movies to be even remotely logical or representative of real life, I don't think you will like it either."
2,to sum it all up,"When you find a movie like brother where art thou you excpect a twisted comedy thats fiction. Well it is fiction and it is certainly twisted.Oh brother where art thou is an absolutely terrible movie. If your gonna get a comedy about the early 1900's with actors that dont fit the plot your takin a huge risk. And if you took the risk on this movie, well all i have to say is sorry because it doesn't have any dialogue nor nutin. But what makes you hate the movie the most is just that it isnt funny at all. They try to make you laugh even smile but THIS MOVIE JUST stinks...Sorry I had to dis this movie so much its just that watching it on a plan without being allowed to turn it off really gets on your nerves."
5,The blu-ray color's a bit off!,"A note to interested shoppers - be aware that the color correction on the blu-ray is a bit different from previous versions of the film. There's a lot more ""green"" in the movie than previously. Check out the dvdbeaver review to see some pictures of this. This is one of my favorite movies and I'm sure it'll still be enjoyable and beautiful, but I wanted to share this info."
4,"Funny, silly, inane...","but extremely entertaining. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are hilarious. In reality, every role was played to the hilt and well-done."
5,True Classic Wish they make a Director's Version,"This film will be a classic, and will not go away in years. They should make a director's cut, but I think because the DVD is still selling very well the owners of this movie will not."
5,O Brother where art thou,one of the best movies ever! we truly enjoy it and watch it often and laugh just as hard each time we see it!
5,The film I watched and chuckled with!,The Big Rock Candy Mountain had me chuckling and the tear jerking moments involving the darker scenes brought choked tears to my eyes. I think the best this movie can offer is laughs and lighthearted atmosphere to enjoy! This movie is worth renting watching and buying! I believe this film had some depth and charm that is overlooked!
3,not the coen's best movie,"O Brother where art thou is a decent movie but I was expecting something more. It was their first movie since big lemboski so my expectations where pretty high for o brother where art thou. However, watching the movie made me realize that this movie is not as good as the other coen brother's movies which I wish it were."
3,Great Movie,The movie was weird and George Clooney seemed so different in this movie. It made me laugh though certain parts of the film left me confused.
1,When does it get Funny?,I love comedies. When someone told me this was the funniest movie they ever saw I had to see it. I'd rather get a root canal before watching it again.You want a comedy? TryRocketmanorDumb and Dumber
2,Didn't do it for me,"I was amazed the good reviews this movie received, because I found it embarrassingly cheesey and contrived. Maybe that was supposed to be part of the charm, who knows...The movie felt like in a lot of scenes, they were trying to be quirky and offbeat just for the sake of being quirky and offbeat, and it just ended up not being very entertaining for me. George Clooney felt like he was acting...only the always excellent John Turturro was believable for me. The music was effective and really crucial to setting the mood of each scene. ..in fact, that may have been the most entertaining part of the whole movie. I think I chuckled maybe once or twice thruout the whole movie and really lost interest in it part way through. Can't recommend it, but judge for yourselves."
2,???? was this?,"I really wanted to like this movie, but.....I thought it was meaningless and boring. Maybe that was the attraction...movies like this allow people to feel smart! I felt like the Coens were testing my ""coolness"" factor!The peripheral characters were there for what reason? To take up time? Must have been, because they had absolutely no impact or relationship to the action of the movie. Their presence was totally random.I thought that the entire film made fun of the South and Southerners (and no, I am not one). And what was the point of the cow being hit by a car? That was cruel and thoughtless. Did they think it was funny?The sepia cinematography was gorgeous. That is the best thing I can say about this movie.-----------------------------------------------------------------"
2,"O Brother, Where Art Thou!","I can not believe you ranked this a 4 or so. Not only did it lack focus, It was not even that funny or creative. Too stupid to be good. Sorry but I don't agree this was a good movie!"
4,Good movie,"I say this as someone who doesn't like George Clooney movies. He always seems to play the same guy and I don't like that guy.This movie, on the other hand, shows why he's considered a great actor. I've only recently seen it and I had to get the dvd.It's darn funny and the music is pretty good too."
5,Surprising performance,"The plot had an old fashioned, downhome feel with a somewhat modern (or perhaps timeless) theme. The hyjinx was enjoyable, and the singing was a fun surprise!"
4,Not your usual movie,Strange twists and interesting characters make this movie a riot. Made for a good escape from my usual viewing. Will recommend to others.
4,"Not Homer, but good stories","This movie is said to be loosely based on Homer's ""Odyssey"". I guess ""loosely"" is a key word here; you won't find much Homeric imagery in this movie.But one thing that does seem to be adapted from Homer is the style of the story, which is not so much a single plot as a succession of adventures loosely strung together. Here the Cohen brothers did a good job of constructing a series of adventures that are worth the telling, and are up to their usual standards of presentation.I found the prominent use of bluegrass music throughout the movie a little hit-and-miss. It helped set the tone of the movie, but was somewhat distracting."
4,O' Brother,"O Brother, Where Art Thou? An all time favorite, I laugh out loud every time I watch this movie. Some people don't get it, one either loves it or doesn't. Great movie to have around whenever you want to ""keep on the sunnyside""D"
5,Best Picture of the Year,"The Coen Brothers,the brains behind such wondeful movies such as Raising Arizona,The Big Lebowski,and Fargo,have brought unto us O Brother Where Art Thou?.I have seen Gladiator,Erin Brokivich,Almost Famous,Chocolat,The Patriot,and Traffic.None of them match up to this movie,not even Traffic.The cast,especially George Clooney,uses the funny and in depth dialogue to bring us much needed humor in this year of non-funny movies(with the exception of What Women Want).The onlything better than the movie is the soundtrack.The Coen Brothers use very special music in their movies(like the Spanish version of Hotel of California in The Big Lebowski),once again,they succeed in this task.With the Coens bringing back Goodman and Hunter,O Brother Where Art Thou? is definately this years Best Picture."
5,my favorite,"This is my favorite movie of all time. I never much liked George Clooney until I saw this film and realized how wildly funny he can be. His compulsive haircare and the fit he pitches over FOP vs. Dapper Dan just kill me! The acting is great by all though, and the characters are truly priceless! I am tempted to describe all my favorite bits from the movie here, but it would just be way too much writing. In my opinion, the best humor in this film is subdued, but it is also extremely clever and biting. I also appreciate the loose connections with actual events and people from the period: Tommy (Robert) Johnson at the crossroads, George (Baby Face) Nelson, TVA projects, etc. It probably helps if you don't hate old-time music and bluegrass, but being steeped in it myself I really couldn't say. For me, purchasing this movie was worthwhile, because I never get tired of watching it. I hope you'll like it too."
5,Is five stars all I can give it? Add 5 more to that,"What can I say. The title of this here review says it all really.But you'll have to watch it twice to fully understand it. There are some parts that you need to pay close attention to. You need to get thesoundtrack for it as well. There's some really good 'old time religious' music on there. as well as ""I am a man of constant sorrow"". Which, by the way, I am listening to now."
5,Not Just a 'Go Here and Do This' Book,"This book not only gives you the answers that you've been struggling for, but it also tells you why the answer is what it is as we follow the author in an interesting and easy to read story. I found myself on several occasions saying, ""Oh yeah. I noticed that too, but I never knew what it meant."" Even reading about the many answers I was able to solve on my own was enjoyable."
5,For Britney fans!,"My daughter received this for her Birthday and fell in love with her. Her song is great, not to loud and the words were clear. She has a great outfit and extras."
1,"U, for UNREAL...........","Ok, so here we go. I ordered this doll. I'm all excited and everything and when I open the package, I'm in shock. The picture you all see there is deceiving. It really looks like Britney Spears there, but no, when you get it, it's a total dissapointment, and looks nothing like the real Britney Spears. If you want a good laugh, surely get this doll, but if you are looking for something serious, get another doll. A total thumbs down for this thing."
2,Annoying,"There can be no mistaking the fact that this is a bad film. But this is not the reason why I dislike it.I dislike this film because there are so many excellent Clive Cussler books that deserve being turned into big movies, and because of the sheer awfulness of this film, Cussler has turned down all offers for deals on the other books in his Dirk Pitt series. So there will be no more Dirk Pitt films, all thanks to this pile of rubbish."
1,"In a word, don't.","Any resemblance between this film and Clive Cussler's novel is purely accidental. If you want a prime example of how ""Hollywood"" can butcher a film adaptation of a book, here it is. The sequence of events doesn't come anywhere close to the book, and the ending is so different you will wonder if the screenwriter bothered to read it first.There is one plus; John Barry's score is powerful and majestic. But don't buy this video to hear it. Go for the cd.Instead of buying this video, take your 10 bucks and set fire to it. You will probably find it more entertaining."
3,Raising the Titanic - This IS Fiction,"Seriously, this is one of my favorite movies! Granted it's got a hackneyed script and having a nuclear submarine head off the Russians (we were still in the ""Cold War"" remember?) was a bit far fetched, but what makes it a favorite is:Richard Jordan - Always a treat to watch act, no matter if he is playing Harley on the Equalizer or General Armistead in Gettysburg.Sir Alec Guiness and Jason Robards for the same reasons.The best part - the first 15 minutes when you have the excellent John Williams score interspersed with photos of the actual Titanic before it's maiden voyage. Not even James Horner, with Cameron's Titanic comes close. It brings back the feeling of the era and the pathos of man thinking that humans could design a ""ship that God, himself, couldn't sink"".This is definitely worth a watch even if you find you don't like it. It's a couple of hours well spent."
2,dissapointed,I was dissapointed that the movie left out so much great stuff that the book has to offer. I truly feel that Cussler was robbed of the finer and major points of his work. I also didn't like thier choice of actors for characters like Admiral Sandecker or Dirk Pitt. I hope in the new movie they plan onmaking McCaunahey decides to take the role if not Harrison Ford or someone like that.
4,Great movie,Since I am a major Clive Clusser fan and Titanic buff this was a perfect movie for me. I've read every one of Dirk Pitt's adventures and this is the only one able to make it to film. I wish Clive could make agreements to get others produced.
4,Raize the Titanic,"I wont say the movie was in real good condition but I think I got my money's worth out of it. At the very end of the movie, The movie was really warped. It depicted a scene where a guy found the gold he was looking for but it was burried with a man in a graveyard. Thats when the movie started getting warped. Glitching and stoping clicking the same scene second over 40 and even 50 times and making a horrible screaching sound when there should have been music playing in the movie so it wasnt in the best of care. It was slightly dammaged product but I did get my money's worth because I got to watch most of the movie and this movie is also a collectors item so I cant complain too much."
5,One of My FAVORITE Guilty Pleasure movies!,"People, When does a movie HAVE TO BE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE to be entertaining? IT IS A MOVIE - and a great movie at that! It is a movie based on a FICTIONAL book! I watch this movie at least once a month because it is extremely entertaining and yes, there are parts (I think thanks to the score) that I get chills! It is well filmed, dramatic and GREATLY ACTED!!!!!!! I do not watch movies for historical accuracy - UNLESS I AM WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY - I watch movies to be entertained . . . and this movies does that! I only wish a Region 1 DVD with JUST THIS MOVIE would come out, as my VHS TAPE (YES, FUNCTIONING VHS!) is starting to wear from so many viewings!"
3,good premise,"ive read the book and seen the movie and i can say this, read the book today, see the movie on a rainy and boring saturday afternoon.The best parts of this film are a great premise, good f/x, and a terrific cameo by the great Alec Guiness. The worst parts are mediocore acting, several dull spots, and the fact that this film has been outdated since the Titanic was discovered(not in 1 piece) in 1985. But like i said, just put it on when there nothing else on."
2,"It cost a lot, it was a flop!","This film cost a hell of a lot to make (deja vu!) however it did not receive the 11 oscars the other more recent film received. It is okay, more like a cross between a James Bond plot/Cold War novel. However in my opinion it just shows the greed of the US and USSR in grave robbing the majestic liner."
2,"forget all the other complaints, this is just really boring","Sure people talk about the problems with this movie and sure some people love it, but all that aside, the movie is quite boring. Not one thrill to be had,not one!!!!!"
2,"Sink it, please","Erm. Producer Lew Grade was responsible for a string of terrible, 'all-star' films in the 1970s - 'The Cassandra Crossing' being another one - and of this he said that it would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic. A fortune was spent on it, something like $40 million dollars at a time when that was huge, and the end result is a film which, although not as bad as legend has it, is nonetheless terribly dated and stilted.In its favour, the effects are quite good, there's a superb score by John Barry, and the image of the Titanic sailing into New York harbour half a century late is poignant. But against it... there isn't any memorable dialogue, the acting is completely blank (a film which wastes Jason Robards is a bad film indeed), and it just goes on and on and on. And on. It's not bad enough to be camp and not good enough to be entertaining, although it passes the time if you don't care what you're watching."
1,Did not receive,I never received the movie and made contact with the seller and I am awaiting my refund. It was lost in the mail.
1,Beware Plastic Hose Connection That Break.,Installed one of these in my girlfriends jeep and less than a week later I got a call from her that the jeep was broken. The bottom hose had broken off right at the radiator. The radiator I pulled out was made of metal.
4,Can't beat it!,"The solder station works well. This is an unbelievable value for the money! Of course, it obviously is not built as ""pretty"" as some as the more expensive units but who cares.. the vacuum pump works well, it heats fast and maintains tempurature well. My only gripe with the station is the solder iron stand.. that sucks. It should be much heavier and have a spring type guide to help insert the hot iron. Other than that, make the purchace.. you won't be sorry!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I have been using Hakko for 17 years and have been overall impressed with everything except the price...I thought I could get somthing for less money.The Aoyue is at best average for hobby soldering,,,it is NOT hot enough for miltilayered or double sided PC boards.The Hakko 808 portable desolder performs better for desolder.I will be looking elseware."
2,Desolder Tips Won't Tin,"Can't get the desolder tips to tin (solder should melt onto tip, not bead and fall off) so it does not have a good thermal connection to the joint being desoldered. Not good..."
5,tupac is the best ever,Ok well Tupac Shakur is the best rapper that ever liver and no one will ever top him. It is a same what happened to him he was very talented and i wish he was still here. I have ever cd he ever maede and he is mostly all i listen to.. I think all the books writen about him are good as long as they say the good points about him to and how sweet lhe was.Tupac Amuru Shakur R.I.P.
4,"Nice buy, have been wearing the same since highschool",I played waterpolo in highschool and recently decided to start swimming again at my gym. Just as I remembered comfortable and not that it's important but it sucks everything in in the right places! Just be sure to rinse it out really well after going in chlorinated pools they start to get thin if you don't rinse them out well.
4,good suite,"Wife likes it. Says it fits well and is a thicker suite, which she likes. Reversible is good so she can change colors depending on her mood. Overall, a good suite."
2,"Ok, reference book",This was purchase to assist me with planning a sweet16 party. Didnt really have too many ideas that I could use!
4,A GREAT PARTY BOOK!,This book had a lot of neat ideas and and game suggestions for different holidays and gatherings. A must have if you are out of holiday ideas!
4,Use with Terry Dunn's video,"You cannot learn Tai Chi from a book, but this book is a good supplement. It contains body positions with emphasis on hands and stepping diagrams for the Ching style. If you cannot get to a teacher, use it with Terry Dunn's video of the Yang Short Form. It is an exact match."
3,Obnoxious and Self-Indulgent,"Sellars' idea to set the opera in Trump Tower is intriguing, and it does bring the class conflict at the heart of the opera into relief; we see how this story isn't really all that dated. But Sellars never knows when to stop; everything is exaggerated to a ridiculous extent - why does the Count, in his vengance aria, have to flop around the stage like a landed fish? Why does Cherubino have to sing ""Non So Piu"" while dry-humping the pillows on the couch? Instead of saying ""look at what Mozart and DaPonte have to say to us"" Sellars seems to be saying ""look at what a clever director I am!"""
5,Best smoker/grill/bbq for the price.,"I have had this smoker for about 8 years. It is amazing as far as the results you get from it. I have done almost everything you can with it. Smoked salmon, bacon, pulled pork, brisket... all flawless as long as you watch your work. I read that it is ""thin""... I don't see this. I have moved a few times since I got it and need help every time. It is HEAVY. I have refinished it twice and it looks new again. I don't particularly like the bamboo shelves it comes with, but a few years later I replaced them with maple. Even at the current price I would say it is a high value product. If I had to, I would definitely buy it again."
3,1st smokker,"this is agood entry level smoker, it's cheap and my results have been very good. I can't wait to get a better one though."
4,You know what you're getting,"As a grad. student in Tennessee I didn't have the funds to purchase a great smoker, but for under $200 it does the job. I do tons of ribs, and after about five batches I'm constistantly churning out quality pork ribs. I don't really mind the thin metal, that is easiely compensated for, my biggest complaint is that the door isn't tight enough, which makes heating the other side of the grill area harder. But for under $200 I don't expect creme de la creme, I expect something that works, and it does work."
3,Too Cool,"The only problem with this type of smoker is controlling the heat. As hot air naturally rises,you will find that the heat is much greater near the fire box and then travels upward accross the top of the grill and out the vent. Requires much repositioning of the meat."
1,Long Time User - WORST of the bunch,"Have been using smokers for over 15 years and last one - by another competitor - was looking well worn but still functional. Decided to surprise my husband and buy this one...surprise was on me. Out of the box this seemed to have a few nice features especially for the price...$199. It included larger wheels and a stainless vegetable rack which was nice. During first ignition the paint and finish began to peel in HUGE chunks so the plain metal is showing in giant gaps. Finish on competitor brand looks better after all these years than first use with this one! VERY displeased. Finish was ultra thin, peeling and cracking everywhere with first use...fire was NOT that high either. Will be returning for refund but save your money and go with something else. JUNK."
3,Don't buy propane!!!!,My husband owns this smoker. He has just gotten into real authentic BBQ. He has done a lot of research regarding this smoker and has made all the appropriate modifications. He uses the Minion method of fire building and has no problems controlling the heat. This is a good beginners model to start learning about real BBQ. His results with this smoker have been awesome and he would recommend this smoker for anyone who wants to do real BBQ and isn't afraid to do some work to the smoker.
5,Char Broil Silver Smoker,"Delivery time was short and product arrived without damage. Assembly was fairly simple with excellent directions. I have two other smokers, one small Smokey Joe and Bradley electric digital smoker, which I really love. I purchased this larger smoker for more smoking space and to get more intense smoke flavor. After seasoning unit, I smoked 4 full slabs of pork loin ribs, a 14 lb. turkey, a 6 lb. whole chicken, and 8 large chicken breasts. All turned our really great with exception of 1 rib that was too close to the smoke chamber. I didn't follow directions..it was my fault. I was very pleased with this purchase and look forward to new smoking adventures."
2,"Good Cooker, Poor Constructtion",This is a good cooker but begins to deteriorate after the first cooking. Materials are not heavy enough to keep from rusting out. After two and 1/2 yrs. my firebox rusted off and collapsed with a fire in it. Not good. the metal on both the firebox and cooking barrel were completely deteriorated so I couldn't re-attach the firebox. Needs heavier gauge metal.
5,"An excellent look at a vital,part of US political evolution",Dr Kuehne takes on an important aspect of the political thought of the time and how that influence is important in US political development into the modern era.
5,Master of plot,"As always Hammond Innes is a master of plot, place, and suspense. This is quite a good book."
5,I fall in love to both the author and the island,"What island ""is"" this? How can I get to the very outer Hebrides? The novel was so filled with passion and love to the place, and it was very exiting too.First and foremost- the story made me love this wild and green and lonely place. I have a strong feeling that Hammond Innes describes a place he knows. Can someone tell me more about this? It would be great..."
3,"Target - Gene Hackman, Matt Dillon","Overall a good film with just enough action and intrigue to keep you interested. Good points: gives those of us who fought in the ""Cold War"" a look back at the days of the Berlin Wall, East Germany, and the cat and mouse games where no one could be trusted. Bad points: the ending seems disjointed, rushed, and leaves more questions than answers."
3,Fun Movie,A little corny and sometimes silly but it's always good to see Gene Hackman in anything. Not too many surprises.
4,GOOD MOVIE!,"I saw this movie back in 80s.I was teenager .Is good action spy movie but %99 I watched and bought this movie, Because of ""matt Dillon"". He was one of my crushes back in 80s :), I bought this DVD because of him. I guess not to buy, But worth a rental for most of u!"
3,Good for competition,"Like all BJJ, the techniques covered here are great for competition but pretty useless in self defense. Still, a worthwhile read."
4,Zen and the Art of Playing Beethoven Softly,"Artur Schnabel, to me, is one of those legendary music figures from days gone by who I have been afraid to listen to for fear that less than acceptable recorded sound would diminish my ability to appreciate the music. On this collection, my fears was mostly alleviated: the sound is acceptable in all but the fastest passages. In those passages, I found the music to sound cluttered and indistinct. On the quieter passages of the late sonatas and the Diabelli Variations, the music is heavenly. Anyone who thinks that Beethoven is merely loud, anguished playing is in for a real education here. I can see why Schnabel felt that this was Beethoven the way he was meant to be played."
2,"Too Hot, Too Cold","Quite disappointing. To start, the 2 CD's in this collection are labeled white on gold with microscopic characters so you cannot read under normal circumstances. But actually there is nothing to read because other than the pianist name and copy rights, the discs are not labeled (you can label them after listening). But these are the minor problems. I guess I have a problem with Schnabel: he makes everything extreme; piano is too quiet, forte is too loud, fast is to fast, slow is too slow. It is so ""Hot or Cold"" I could get the flu. You would think that sonata No 21 is fool proof, but when Schnabel plays it, the first movement goes so fast, it turns into a blur of sounds. The second movement so slow, you get bored. Then the 33 variations... I could not master the discipline to finish them more than once. If you were after sonatas No. 30 and 32, I would opt for Brendel's recording anyhow. Brendel's 1995 recording (Philips) is as close as you could ever get to absolute perfection!"
2,slow and boring,I stopped reading it. It never engaged my interest. The story line seemed non-existant. I would not buy another of her stories based on this one.
3,fragile!,"Both my Macaw and cockatiel picked and licked on the Manu perch to start with. Now they just use it as a perch.One perch broke (cracked in shipping?) and left a dangerous metal rod exposed.We removed the entire thing and placed the broken piece on the ground for the birds to pick at. They enjoy picking at the holes in the Manu, so they must be getting some mineral benefit...maybe they were low on ""this mineral"" and after their initial fill of mineral, now they only want/need a little of it in their diets, as with any new food item, except fresh spinach, bananas, grapes and almonds...thier favorites!"
2,light squeeling when coming to a complete stop,Not happy with the noise from these pads. They work fine just annoying when applying brakes lightly when coming to a complete stop.
5,Great Young Adult novel set in Wales,We really enjoyed reading this as a family and would be interested in more paperbacks by Nancy Bond. The story and characters are engaging and feel real.
5,A magical Book,String in the harp kept me wanting to read more book s like thus one. One of the best NEwbery books there is. the setting is in Wales. Two kids find something that takes them oon a journey that they will remember for a life time.
3,The Harp Strikes a Chord....,"When Jennifer Morgan agrees to spend the winter holiday with her family in Wales, she could never have known what the visit would turn into...an extended stay, an ancient harp key, a bard from the 6th century, a museum curator, a bird watcher, a wolf and a family of sheep farmers all come together to create an exciting, albeit sometimes difficult, tale of family, strength and honor. Ms. Bond's book is well written; however, some of the Welsh names and mythologies can be difficult to follow."
2,Well i didn't love this book but it was ok,Well i didn't love this book but it was ok. The book wasn't very exciting and it was not very suspensfull. I read this book a long time ago so i didn't really look for books that i thought i would like it was long and i needed a long book. I probably would not recamend this to someone like me but feel free to take a risk!
2,Couldn't get into it,"Although many people I know enjoyed this book, I simply could not get in to it. It's somewhat hard to follow because the author hops from character to character. One paragraph the reader is with one person, the next theyare with a different one, and the two seen to have nothing to do with each other. I thought that what was going on in the story was good, but that the way it was written was confusing."
1,picture is deceptive,"Be aware that, although the picture of the item shows a box of guards, you are paying for only ONE tree guard. Consequently the price seems excessive. I returned the item without using it, but the design seems appropriate and sturdy for its purpose."
3,Tree Guards,The product OK but seems to only work on young trees not mature trees. I had to send the product back because of this.
1,Extremely over priced,Do not buy this. It is extremely over priced. A tin can cut lengthwise will work as well. I assumed there would be several in the box for the price. There is only one. The price would be fair if there were 10 in the box but to pay this much for only one is far too much.
5,The King of Coolers,"Great product!!Keeps the cold in for days. Also has compartments for storing other things ontop. Has separator for storing ice on one side or the other (Basically you dont have to spread the ice in the entire cooler, you can have it all together in one corner). Has standard drainage on bottom for release of water.These last forever, I purchased mine because a friend has had one for over 10 years.Sergio V."
4,coleman 150 quart cooler,"Item shipped as stated and all was as described other than the handles are now a heavy duty plastic handle, but they still attach with a rope. This is a nice cooler that holds ice well especially with the latching lids. The dividers and meat tray are nice as well."
5,HUGE!!!,"Going camping for a long weekend with a family of 5? This cooler is perfect for you! It was for me. Keeps the ice for at least 4 days(not all of it, but there is quite a bit left). And when your not using it, its a pefect size for storing your sleeping bags. The only drawback is the clasps don't lock good enough. They pop open with little effort."
4,Amazing (just like the book),"I read the book Magician and loved every page of it. I was just browsing for a new rpg, but couldnt find an interesting one. That was before I found this amazing game. Take on the roll of Pug, an interesting young boy who has a talent for magic but doesnt know how to use it until he is made a slave on the alien planet Kelewan. He is then sought out for his magic abilities and made into a Great One (the tsurani's magicians.) It is all very interesting and fun to play so dont waste money or time on food and clothes just wrap yourself in a blanket and play this game!"
4,Good biographical piece,"While not the most exciting of works, this memoirish book gives great insight into Priestley's views of his life and profession. For someone so prolific and famous in his own time, Priestley has now lost much visibility compared to his peers in the post-World War Two period -- and this helps remind the reader of the heights he achieved in his heyday. Of note, this rare work can be found in a dusty library in eastern Zambia if one truly needs a copy."
2,Brahms and Pollini Mix like Oil and Water...,"Don't get me wrong, Pollini is and always will be one of my favorite pianists; it's just that his temperament is diametrically opposed to that of Brahms. Brahms is warm, lush, and emotional while Pollini is dry, precise, and clinical. This style never suits Brahms well, and this CD quickly pales in comparison to such mature interpretations as Arrau's or Rubinstein's. For example, the entrance of the piano in the first movement is characterized by a passionate and willful longing; Pollini simply gives us a boring, metronomical account devoid of depth or substance. In my opinion, he should stick to Beethoven and composers of the 20th century (listen to his recordings of Beethoven's late Sonatas and Stravinsky's Petrouchka) because it is disappointing to hear such a masterful pianist miss the point so completely. If you purchase this CD, I can assure you that you will be musically unsatisfied."
1,Extremely Let Down,"Couldn't play the DVD once I received it. It was a British made DVD and it won't play on my Sony DVD player, I guess the copying devices used to write the film is the wrong format. It would have been nice if the company would have disclosed that before I purchased it! I will be attempting to get my money back or at least credit back! Too bad to, I really like this movie and was looking forward to seeing it again and it's a hard one to find! I wish Amazon had a disclosure when films were going to be shipped or sold from out of the country, it's very hard as a consumer to know where the items you are purchasing are coming from. I'll try to investigate better next time!"
4,A Man Called Horse,"Brought back a lot of memories! Though not competely accurate regarding the traditions and practices (Hollywood... what are ya gonna do?), it gives a little insight into the life of the American Indian and their collision with American expansion."
5,A Man Called Horse,"Good historical, western. I enjoy the insight into some of the American Indian beleifs."
4,A Man Called Horse,A Man Called HorseThis movie was in like new condition and played well. the shipping time was great. I saw this movie in the theater a long time ago and now I have it in my DVD collection. Its a great movie played by one of my all time favorite actors Richard Harris. A great movie
4,Enjoyed the flick,"As a movie buff and especially liking outdoorsy-type films, I had a good time watching this fictional flick. I liked the film for the wild west adventure. Knowing it was FICTION, I did not watch it to be educated, but rather to be entertained. If one expects a more factual presentation regarding any movie of fiction, they should turn to other sources such as the library, not Hollywood. I thought Richard Harris did an excellent job portraying the man of his scripted role, and he helped me escape from reality as I became absorbed into his fight for survival."
2,"If you're into factual Indian Culture, stay away.","This is another wreck of Indian ways and culture told by Hollywood story tellers, who had no idea what an Indian really was. If you look at the fact that Sioux Indians were in the North West, then why did his companion, who spoke French, was the way of Indians in the lower East of America.Besides that, why did Harris's character, who after living with the Indians for so long, never bothered to even learn their language. At one point, he is teaching his new wife english...how sad. But, that's Hollywood, and this is an exploitation Hollywood-style, of the true and authentic Indian Cultures.Terrible acting, sound and editing, stay away from this one. You'll be glad you did."
2,A MAN CALLED BLOAT,"This is a silly tale to come out of the so called 'enlightened 70's' when the white man was viewed with evil suspicion. It deals with a man from England who goes on to become a savior to a band of poor and starving Sioux Indians in the 1840's when they accept him as part of the tribe. Poignantly sadistic and offensive to the actual Sioux ritual of the Sun dance, it merely accommodates the new role of Harris as a Christ-like benefactor while objectifying the Indians as a tribe of incoherent savages. Once again, the view point is told by an outsider who functions solely to play the role of 'savior'. One scene is especially tedious and tritely when a tribe of Shawnee attack the Sioux encampment and Harris gathers all the Sioux and leads them like an 1800's era gun ensemble to fight off the attacking horsemen! ""First row fire, second row hold!""... It's no wonder why white people never fully understood Native American culture."
1,A Man Called Horse,"A one dimensional portrayal of the Sioux. The movie is told as seen by an outsider or ""captive"" point of view. The Sioux in this movie are shown to be ignorant, dirty savages - indicative of the norm of public thought leading up to the time the movie was made. The ""indians"" in this movie do a lot of yelling and whooping, pointing at objects with spears, and jumping around in front of bon fires. The ""indians"" much resembled the neanderthals in ""Clan of the Cave Bear"". This film would make a great study for college courses. It shows much of the ignorant one-sided misconceptions about Native Americans held by early America up to the late 1970's."
4,I love the way this comforter feel!,This comforter is so soft and warm up quick when you get into bed. The only draw back is that its a little small. I just wish there was another 2 inches on each side just so it lays better when you make the bed. Other then that I am totally happy with my purchase.
2,worst buy ever,"This is one of the worst down comforter I have ever seen. It looks good when you buy it. But when i started using it it was nothing that I expected from a down comforter. It surface becomes cold and remains cold. That may because of the polyster. I had to take the fleece shawl between comforter and me. Also the down has started coming out within one week. So when ever I sleep with sweater on, next day morning my sweater is all white with down. I thought it must be from the factory so i washed as per the instructions and still it is the same. The stiching is of really poor quality and down keeps coming out. Its a cheap product with cheap quality. If you need a good down comforter buy a good one from famous outlets."
2,Disappointed in stuffing,This comforter has little to no batting or stuffing in it. We were very disappointed but did not want to waste the time in returning it to you.
1,Plastic not brass,"I received this promptly, but it was plastic, not brass, always read reviews before makimg a selection. Picture at webpage is brass."
1,Laughable,"This CD is a joke, from its pretentious misspelling of the title to the comparisons to Beach Boys/Moody Blues. If there are any good reviews here, they are likely from the artist's friends or maybe even written himself.There is nothing redeeming about this CD. It sounds like a recording made in someone's basement, and while that might lend a certain charm in other situations, in this case it's unbearable to listen to. Please save your money. To call it ""amateurish"" would be an understatement."
2,Some Strange Titles...,"I didn't see a listing of the songs included in this book, so I bought it on blind faith. Some strange, obscure titles by well known artists are included while their more popular songs were omitted-why, I don't know. If you want a variety of fairly tame tab, this book may be for you. As a part time working musician, I don't find this publication very useful. John Denver, but only one Led Zep tune? C'mon, Hal Leonard...."
3,Not Exactly What Dr. Baker Hoped For,I took linear algebra from Dr. Baker when this book was first published. When I took the course I found the book more difficult to read than other math textbooks. Some of the examples are difficult for the student to follow without further explanation. I agree that the book can easily be read in one semester because it is quite short; however I feel that in some cases its brevity hurts more than it helps. On a more positive note I have found the book to be a very useful reference for refreshing my linear algebra skills and definitions. It is easy to thumb through and find the information you need. As a side note the binding of the first printing was extremely poor and most of my classmate's books started falling apart within a few months. Dr. Baker said he was working with Rinton Press to fix this problem but I don't know if it has been resolved yet.
3,A dummies guide to Banking,"I am really surprised by all the glowing reviews. I have to think that they are students, friends and colleagues, because honestly this has little to do with gold or economics and a lot to do with banking and bookkeepping and a I really think that bookkeepers, tellers and such should and would benefit from this very simple and approachable book. By the end, when Bernstein finally hits Gold most knowledgeable people who know something about economics, learnt elsewhere I may add, you can see that he is running out of a lot of steam and the book veers into more Keynesian politics than anything else. But the first 2/3rds of the book are solid banking principles and on that basis I would recommend it."
5,andrew bird is fantastic,"though the mysterious production of eggs is my favorite, andrew bird never fails to impress or please. if youre looking for mellow, but also moving, go for it! you wont be dissapointed!"
4,melodies for solitary moments,"I like to listen to this album when I'm washing the dishes. This is good music to have around when sitting on the back porch. Sometimes, I'll play it when I'm boiling eggs for salad or when I'm lying in the front hall after a long day at work.I'm a huge fan of Bird and his Bowl of Fire. Loved the first two records. The third one, ""The Swimming Hour,"" felt like a shift away from the old fiddle-and-dagger-and-dancehall stuff, a necessary experiment -- and I did dig bits and pieces but most of it shook me off.""Weather Systems"" isn't a return to the old style, and he's put away the Bowl, but it's a firm step in another interesting direction; a better direction, I think. But it still has the same excellent strings, same incredible harmonies, and more chipper, twisted lyrics. It's more contemplative and sometimes I wish Bird would jump back up on the table and dance, but he's still given me a soundtrack for the next couple of months."
5,Amazing,"My first experience with Andrew Bird was Spring 2000 in London. I was stoked to go see Buddy Guy perform and knew nothing of the opening band. That band was Andrew Bird's Bowl of Fire and I was totally transfixed the instant they started to play. I was amazed that three guys (one of the band was out sick) could play so many instruments and do so much musically. As soon as I got back to the States I purchased their first album.When Andrew Bird went solo I was worried that the music would suffer and I was disappointed in Weather Systems the first time I heard it. It was actually a let-down after The Swimming Hour, which grabbed me the first time I heard it. This album is much more subdued than his prior works so it takes a clear mind to really hear it. After listening to Weather Systems more I am in love with it. It is not so somber as it first seems, and the simple beauty of Don't Be Scared lifts my spirit every time I hear it. This, along with all of his prior albums, is one to own."
4,whistling?,"I love stumbling upon artists who cannot be pigeon-holed into one genre. The songs on this album are crafted. Layers of simple melodies, plucked violin, and whistling. This is a gem of an album."
1,Alert,"This book seris is not like other books created by Nancy Rue. This book is labled for readers 9-12 years old.However, the content is Not approprite for the age group suggested. Nine year olds have no business or mind set to deal with the subject of suicide. I am deeply disappointed with Nancy Rue for thinking she is reaching this age group by taking on content that is robbing our daughters of innocence. Shame on you."
5,toddlers favorite toy,"Ok so let me start by saying I bought this as a ""back up sammy"" Sammy is my daughters teddy bear and he does EVERYTHING with her. Well sammy got left at target one night and so I had to look for a replacement(just in case) I guess this is a TY bear names Teddy or old face. I dont know. What I do know is that he is durable but if you wash him he loses that silky softness. When i opened the box the bear was so pretty and soft I knew right away he wouldnt pass for ""sammy"". Way to pretty. But he is durable. He has been ran over, smushed, in the pool, in the toilet. He and adventure child are always up to something. This bear came in the mail super fast which was good for us to know. (even though sammy made it home) She wouldnt have to be without long. And new he is a very beautiful bear. And if your little one needs a special bud i recommend any TY. Because 1 they are usper good besties and 2 you know you can find them again on amazon!"
4,Auctioneer's Lot,Good read but not as funny as his second book. It gave you a good insight of an auctioneer's job.
3,It'll do but I wouldn't recommend it.,"This is our first stroller since our 9 month old grew out of his carseat/universal carrier. Until recently I've been pretty happy with it. It's got a lot of good features: large basket, safety bar with tray for baby, cup holder for adult, full recline, adjustable handlebar, lightweight and rather easy to steer, fold and carry. However, the thing that initially bothered me is trully a PROBLEM! The straps are poorly designed. They don't tighten enough for my son and he's not a small baby. The other day, he was in the upright position and someone dropped something in front of us. I didn't see it and stopped short when we hit it. My son flew forward, the seat pulled with him(!!!) and his face hit the tray. I had the straps as tight as they would go. The seat SHOULD NOT move with him. I got this stroller because for the money I could spend it seemed the best. It has some great features, but it's not worth the risk to my son. I'll be looking for something else."
2,Seat back will not lock in place = unsafe,"I purchased the Combi Savona hoping it would be my all-in-one stroller - light weight for travel, small to fit in my trunk, universal for use with any car seat, and fully reclining, so it can be used from newborn to 40lbs. The Combi is all these things. HOWEVER, the flimsy back of the stroller cannot be locked into position and the padding is attached with velcro. Even when strapped in snuggly using the 5-point harness (and several frustrating adjustment straps), my 22lb 6 month old can pull himself forward by the snack tray, pulling the cushion and the seat back forward. This causes my son to slide around in the seat. The Combi is unsafe as a stand-alone stroller. And, Combi will not return my calls for a refund (poor customer service)."
5,Great stroller!,"I had bought the Savvy Soho by Combi and loved it, but my son looked very squashed in it. I ordered this stroller and have been very, very happy with it. It is light and folds very compact. It is very easy to steer, and rides very smoothly.there is also a large basket thats holds plenty of items. I highly reccomend this stroller!"
1,Kindle version flawed,"Do not buy the kindle version of this book. It says it is Deborah Tannen's Conversational Style, but it is really Carol Meyer's Discovering Eve."
1,Terribly condescending.,"This book was written for foreign students looking to apply to study in the US, both at undergraduate and graduate level, at a low-intermediate ESL level. It fails to achieve its purpose, simply because it is too ambitious a task for 140 pages. The book is full of exercises and copies of official documents, but it is very confusing because it only touches the surface of many different topics. Also, because it tries to breach the language gap for an EFL student, it deals with complicated issues in an offhandish way, when this is exactly the kind of support these students need. Many students who want to study in the US have a higher level of English anyway, and this book doesn't help."
4,Beauty is ugliness,"A bewitching and hypnotic novel from Jean Genet, the first draf of which was written when he was in prison. Like most of his works, Our Lady of the Flowers has a fragmented plot. It's centered around a murderer, a pimp, and a queen, in a netherworld in which murder is highly erotic and alluring and evil is regarded as sensuous and good. This novels pummels the readers with beautiful and vile imagery, a story within a story that breaks the fourth wall as we follow Jean Genet (who tells us himself the story is only written for masturbatory purposes) in prison, dreaming of luxury and secret worlds. I preferred ""The Thief's Journal"" over this one, but definitely worth picking up."
3,Difficult,"I knew I was in trouble whern I read Sartre's intro.I only read part of the book and found it hard going and beyond me. For full enjpyment, I think one would need to be guided through this novel by someone who understands it."
4,"lush, imperfect, subversive classic","Genet's classic is full of lush, flowery, dreamlike prose and images, and genuinely subversive and anti-social themes. The plot is decidedly non-linear, with many scenes dissolving, more the product of a drug induced dream."
2,Confusing tale of a gay man behind bars....I think,"I figure to be the lone voice of dissent with this novel, which I found confusing and ultimately uninteresting. Genet's novel, written while in prison, jumps back and forth among the many characters, often following tangent upon tangent. I kept losing track of who was who, which one is supposed to be Genet (because I had the distinct impression that this novel might be autobiographical), sorting out the names and sequences of events, and trying to find a storyline that would last long enough to hold my interest. Genet would start on a good story and then all of a sudden jump in another reflection from that, never satisfactorily returning or finishing the original story.It's very sexual and delves into the world of transvestism, but ultimately left me more confused than ever about what Genet was trying to say."
4,More of you need to read this one!,I don't care if you hate homosexuals or if you don't believe in crime- this book is about so much more than that. The style is light and flows beautifully even after the translation.
5,One of the greatest books of all time,Ive just read this book and its definitly one of the best books ive ever read.
3,Nothing stellar,"I was a little disappointed in this product. I bought it for my husband who has diabetes but who loves dark chocolate. It tasted bland to both of us. For the price I was expecting a bit of a ""gourmet"" taste, a chocolate with a smooth, creamy melt. This chocolate tasted a bit gritty and was neither smooth nor creamy.What I did like was that the vendor enclosed a chemical pack with the shipment that kept the chocolate cool enough despite the summer heat. This chemical pack prevented the chocolate from arriving in a brown, mushy package."
3,Just ok,"Not very chocolaty. I wouldn't order them again. If I was hard up, I'd eat one if someone gave it to me."
2,not so great...,the bars are quite small but also if you eat a ful one there is just too much moltitol and you will need to head quickly to the bathroom.
3,Good snack,"In trying to eat a low-carb diet, I have tried all of this brand's chocolate bars. Of those offered the dark chocolate are definitely the best. The maltitol flavoring is certainly not as good as a normal chocolate bar, but considering it's low carb value it's not bad. The dark chocolate is naturally less sweet, and I am guessing that means it gets less of the artificial sweetener in this bar. Either way, if you like dark chocolate and need to avoid the sugar, this is a passable bar which tastes OK. I was much less enthusiastic about the other flavors (almond and coconut)."
2,Maltitol is not what I need,"I don't have to lose weight. However, I am fighting chronic candidiasis and I have to stay away from sugar, all refined carbs and dairy products. When I found these chocolate bars,(which taste great to me!) I wrongly believed I had finally found the chocolates that wouldn't feed my Candida. I was wrong because Maltitol does feed Candida. I found out that XYLITOL is the **only** sweetener that does not feed the yeast. Fortunately, I managed to find delicious dark chocolate bars sweetened with Xylitol on the Internet and I am going to stick to those. Being that Xylitol is so healthy, why isn't it used on more products? Unfortunately, many of us already know the answer. :("
1,Soylent Dick Says:,"One reviewer writes: ""This is the original story the way it is supposed to be seen...""I'm sorry, but the Rex Harrison is NOT the original story. The original story is to be found in Hugh Lofting book, which, despite it's racism, is a charming story.The Rex Harrison movie ruins the story. Read any movie review guide, and they give it what it deserves."
2,Doctor Do Little,"""Doctor Dolittle"" was,amazingly,a nominee for Best Picture in 1967. Rex Harrison was a talented actor in his own right,spot-on as the professor in ""My Fair Lady"" opposite a luminous Audrey Hepburn,and equally great as Julius Caesar in the campfest ""Cleopatra"" with Liz Taylor. ""Doctor Dolittle"" shows the good professor out of place with the animals.""Doctor Dolittle"" is an interminable musical. Harrison is cast as the good doctor who can ""talk to the animals"" (he really does talk,in his talk-singing style) He's in search of a giant pink snail. Some of the special effects are truly psychedelic. Unfortunately, the soundtrack is forgettable and the musical plods through its paces. Doctor Dolittle does little. Not much happens. You're better off with Lassie, National Velvet, and even Flipper."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A film whose troubled production history has filled several books, Doctor Doolittle is every bit as cringe-inducing and laughable as you may have heard; when you reach the scene where Rex Harrison croons a love song to a seal dressed as a woman, I hope you're laughing as hard as I was."
1,Ridiculous- dont bother,I bought this product a few weeks ago and it will only work on american DVD players which would have been nice to know before i spent $40 having it sent to Australia. first time buying off amazon sure as hell wont be making that mistake again!
1,not happy,I have recieved the dvd and couldnt play it as it was on a usa tracking system so it cannt be played in great britain i think it would be worth mentioning this when selling these kind of products. I also didnt receive a return mailing address or i would have returned it
4,Great for all ages!,"The story is sweet, the music excellent, and performances by Rex Harrison, Anthony Newly and Samatha Edger were all believable. Although many may feel that this is a ""child's movie"", my husband and I enjoyed it and we're in our 60's!"
3,"Charming, but Dated","The story of the animal doctor who can talk with animals is charming, but dated. Few of the songs are memorable. Anthony Newly's performance is wonderful. However, Rex Harrison seems bloated and unmotivated. The special effects are fun for the time in which the film was made. A wonderful movie for young children."
4,Doctor Dolittle is a classic!,I was so glad that we were able to purchase this early version of the story of Doctor Dolittle. Rex Harrison is marvelous in the role. The story line is quaint. Costuming is wonderful. My 6-year old daughter enjoyed it as much as I remembered loving it!
5,Enchanting movie,"If you liked Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady, you will love him in this fabulous movie about the famed Dr. Doolittle who talks to all the animals. Anthony Newley is in great singing voice as well as an accomplished actor. Samantha Eggar is beautiful and engaging as the ""stowaway"" who goes with them on the search for the ""Great Sea Snail""."
5,It's Still Great!,"After searching many different places, I finally found the original ""Dr. Dolittle"" here at Amazon. I was very pleased with the quick service and the DVD arrived in perfect shape. The quality of the movie was superb and my grandchildren and I all loved watching it."
5,I love this film,"I really do. It's simple, easy to watch, and younger kids seem to love it. It's just an entertaining film without over-the-top, in your face effects. Best for kids or adults in a mellow mood I would think. It works for me."
5,Typically British. What a movie.,"My daughter in USA - I live in UK - wanted something ""English"" for the children in the way of a DVD, and this was perfect. It is a little old, but the storyline never fails to delight even the older members of the family. Now a big favourite in their collection."
4,good family fun,"""Doctor Dolittle"" was Twentieth Century-Fox's follow-up to""The Sound Of Music"",and although it isn't in the same league as that Oscar-winning Julie Andrews classic,this delightfulfamily film is certainly much better than it's been given credit for.The lavish production is beautiful,the songs arewonderful(I especially like ""Fabulous Places"" and ""Something In Your Smile""),and the cast is appealing.Rex Harrison gives one of his most delightful performances,and he is well supported by Samantha Eggar,Anthony Newley,and young William Dix.The film is too long at two and a half hours plus intermission,but directorRichard Fleischer and screenwriter/songwriter Leslie Bricusse keep it moving along smoothly and swiftly,with a nice sense of humor and a light touch.""Doctor Dolitlle"" is a much better film than the Fox/Andrews/Wise ""Music"" follow-up ""Star!"".It provides an evening of good fun for the entire family."
5,Great family movie!!,"In our family we do movies together so we can teach lessons as they arise. Our boys love musicals, so after we read the book Dr. Doolittle naturally the boys wanted to see the movie. I recommend this movie to families who are ready to snuggle down with some popcorn and be entertained."
5,A fun movie,It was a very warm and comfortable to watch a lot of laughs along the way we loved the movie.
4,Ashe Oshun!,This is a very small but interesting booklet on the Orisha Oshun. Its a good read on her even though its a samll booklet it does contain useful information on this river goddess of love and beauty. It has a few nice stories about her and spells as well in it. Its a nice but short introduction to Oshun the lovely lady of beauty.
1,organic but awful,"I bought this for my husband to take in his lunch, he loves split pea soup. He said this is the worst soup he's ever had, it was just awful. Not recommended at all."
3,Adopted,"I was in a Bible-based thrift store, scrounging around cardboard boxes, half filled with the usual tattered edged, tossed out trashed LPs, and came across this wonderous gem. I liked the look, I liked the price at 50 cents. I took it home like a grinning first date.And OH! how exciting it was! The breathlessness precious understated gasp of ""Anatomy of Love"" and the sweet sanctuary of harmony!Later, I searched for any info on Shellyan Orphan...know now betterbut..the sweetest kiss was the eyes closed wondering..."
3,"Interesting, but weak, early effort by SO","This is for music fans who have the other SO discs and must complete their collection. Otherwise, it's easily forgettable -- with only a few tracks which showcase the range and depth that ultimately make SO so wonderful on their later efforts. (Trivia: Last track contains reference to Shelley.)"
4,WOW!,"This is a great movie. I've watched it so many times. Two people who will never see each other in human form. A lady Hawk at day, a woman at night. Her handler, a wolf at night, but a man by day. Never to see each other again. Well not that dramatic, but still. This is the perfect movie, and I'd recomend it to anyone. Very magical..."
5,Don't Miss The Horse,"Other reviews have pointed out the perfect characterizations of the hero and heroine, the evil Bishop, the bumbling cowardly priest, but for goodness sake don't miss the hero's horse. This horse is the real thing! Bred in the middle ages to carry the knight with all his armor, this magnificent animal really is what he appears to be: the medieval equivalent of the Tiger Tank. Watch him strike down evil, and carry the hero to victory. After the first 10 minutes you will forget the anachronistic boy's behaviour and become submerged in the best movie fairytale since The Wizard of Oz."
4,Please See This Movie!!!! Its Breathtaking!!!!,"I saw this movie with my class and I have to say it was very magical.The movie showed how two people would give almost anything to be together, and thats something you rarely see in movies these days.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to watch movies filled with romance,action,and drama. Please rent this movie and if you like it buy it!!!!"
4,A fine and glorious adventure!,"Ladyhawke is a fine love story set against spectacular scenery. There's plenty of action and excitement, and magnificent horses. The battle scene in the cathedral is a classic, a great climax to a great movie. Broderick's running conversations with God are entertaining, and the supporting characters add texture to the tale. The movie's only fault is its length, though it's still worth the watch.P.S. A bit of movie trivia for horse buffs: Navarre's awesome mount is a Friesian horse. Friesians are a Dutch breed renowned for their high-stepping gaits which make them popular as carriage horses, usually driven in pairs or fours. They are always black, and therefore are often desired to draw a hearse in funeral processions."
5,Intrigueing,i only knew this movie exsisted because my parents had the VHS version. Its actually a great movie the cinematography is beautiful the sound track is kinda off it has some techno and in a movie like this it was a bit weird but honestly a good movie .
4,Perfect modern myth with music that had nothing to do with the film,"This film was the wonderful story of a classically well-done myth, right down to basing the climax on an eclipse. There was the flaw that the moon shown the evening before the eclipse was the wrong lunar phase, and then there was the music! This romantic, mystical story with cinematography reflecting this mood, had peculiarly loud ""fight scene"" music that blasted forth destroying the overall feel. Ah well, it probably worked for 13 year old boys who watched to lust over Michelle Pfeiffer."
3,misimformed,"In the amazon ad Ladyhawke VHS was not listed, it said Ladyhawke disc, I assumed it was the DVD but it was VHS, the seller had it listed as VHS and I didn't notice it listed as VHS with the receipt. Other words I was satisfied with everything else."
2,Passable fantasy adventure; worst movie score ever?,"As medieval fantasy adventure goes, Ladyhawke is passable. The conceit of the lady being a hawk by day and her sweetiepie a wolf by night is clever. And it's decently executed here by director Donner, and stars Broderick, Hauer, Pfeiffer and McKern. But the music score? Who, even in the 80s, thought that something like this was a good idea for a medieval story? This awful score would barely do justice to a Starsky & Hutch or Magnum PI--where it actually might kind of properly belong. My wife and I watched the film recently and were practically rolling on the floor with laughter as this 80s musical kitsch filled our living room coincidentally with scenes from a medieval fantasy. It absolutely ruins the film."
4,Good show,Love watching Matthew Broderick as a young pick-pocket. He was very good as that character. The story line is good. I enjoyed it a lot.
5,Blu ray the way it should be,"I'll start by saying that Ladyhawke is one of my all-time favorite romances. I finally took a chance and spent the @$40 to upgrade the rather mediocre dvd to blu-ray. Rarely have I been happier with a blu-ray purchase! The enhancement to my enjoyment of the movie is amazing! I'm no techie, but I am very visual, and practically purred over the improvement. It was like discovering the movie all over again. If you are hesitating, I can say that my purchase through David Ho (boyoyo) went smoothly. It took a bit of time to get here from Hong Kong, but nothing unreasonable. And the disk was unopened and in perfect condition. In fact, I used to have to fix the language setting on my dvd, but no such issues here. Wonderful!!!!"
3,Disappointing,"Ladyhawke is an elegant fantasy that features good production values, a decent cast, and appealing characters. Its weakness, however, is mostly due to the score. Other S&S movies, namely ""Conan the Barabarian"" and ""Excalibur"" were redeemed by masterful scores. The music in this one is annoying and down right awful. The special effects are acceptable when they arrive, but there's little action, and most of the fight scenes are mild and rather uninvolving. With an absense of the above, this movie really shoots itself in the foot with its overlength. It goes on forever, making you not only eager for the lovers to reunite, but for the film to end. I'm being generous by giving it three stars."
3,"Look, Don't Listen","Most reviewers have noticed the same thing: this film has great charm, but a terrible music track nearly sinks it. This is why DVDs were invented. If Ridley Scott could release the DVD of ""Legend"" with the original Jerry Goldsmith score, then Richard Donner can scrape up some better music for one of his best-loved films. It certainly deserves a second chance at being a masterpiece."
4,I loved this movie!!!!!!!! :),"I love this movie!!!!!!! :) the DVD version is good because the night scenes in the video version of the movie, you really can't see what's happinging in the ngiht, and the dialogue is kind of hard to hear in the video version , but the DVD version has the subtitles to look at. This movie is a total tearjerker...I gave this movie a 4 out of 5 because the music in the movie was kind of annoying..but overall if you can get over the music and watch the movie..you will love it!! :)"
3,Good Movie Bad Music,Very good movie the only complaint is get good music like holy stuff like Conan The Barbarian used not this Jazy stuff. And a little better story line.
4,Ladyhawke,Good DVD; It is rather hard to find. I gave it as a gift and the person I got it for has enjoyed it.
5,The Mouse has Left the House.,"I love a fairy tale that has all the components: good guys, bad guys, a great love story and a young Matthew Broderick. Also there is a ruined castle and a marvelous black horse that dances rather than walks or trots.But the hawk is spectacular as it soars above the water dipping its' talons as it flies and accompanied by beautiful background music.Actors are all outstanding including Michelle Pfeiffer, Rutger Hauer,Leo McKern and John Wood. But, Broderick is a real winner as the ""mouse."" He is a thief who talks to God and becomes drawn in to the tragic love story. But like all good fairy tales, there is a happy ending.This is a 1985, flick but if you enjoy a very sweet story with a lot of action, this is a must see!"
3,Worth a look - not much else,"Ladyhawke is worth a look if you like and sword and shield type movies. Its even worth owning if you find it in the discount bin. However, it's by no means a great film. You have to wonder what this movie could have been had it been made in a different era... perhaps pre-Excalibur (1981). As it is the movie suffers from several problems - the least of which is one of the worse mis-matched soundtracks ever... even die-hard fans agree that the synth heavy ""disco-fantasy"" music is just silly.The best part about Ladyhawke is it's unpretentiousness. It is a very straightforward fantasy movie that in no way insults the viewer's intelligence - unlike many other films of this genre."
2,This Lady deserves better treatment,"Though the film itself is still an enjoyable adventure (as other reviewers have already stated), the DVD treatment of it is decidedly lacking. The only viewing choices are ""fullscreen"" which means (at least on my flatscreen TV) the sides of the picture are cut off and the image stretched to fit the TV from top to bottom; or, on the flip side of the disc, the so-called ""letterbox"" version, where the film is presented in its original ratio, but in an absurdly small rectangle in the middle of the screen.You'd think if the studio was going to go to the expense of transferring a film to disc, they'd take at least a little more care with it. As it is, this version's not even worth paying Amazon's discounted price for; buy it used. Or, better, just rent it."
2,Very Average,"While the idea behind this movie has great potential its actual execution was rather blase. The soundtrack takes away from the story instead of enhancing it, the acting is not that great, and the script is kind of silly. Its entertaining in its own way but definitely not something I'd watch more than once."
4,Wonderful story,I only recently saw this movie. I wish I would have seen it when it first came out. The acting was a bit choppy (especially accents). Even though I have been greatly impressed by their later works. The wonderful story more than made up for the films weakness. I would advise this movie for anyone. END
2,"Why, Alan Parsons? Whyyy?","This movie has excellent acting and a great plot. It also has the absolute worst score I've ever heard, by far. I tried to ignore it, but it would not be ignored. The Alan Parsons soundtrack completely ruined the movie."
2,"Good movie, horrible DVD!","The movie itself is pretty good. More of a ""chick-flick"" than I'd like, but it still has a compelling storyline, and will be loved by romantics. Good acting too. The soundtrack, however, leaves a lot to be desired. Very dated and tired.However, the biggest problem by far is the DVD menu, which is terrible to the point of being almost unusable. When playing this on a brand new Samsung upscaling DVD player it defaulted to English subtitles, and wouldn't yield the disc menu. Turning those subtitles off proved extremely difficult, as the DVD constantly got locked up. At one point I had to unplug the player just to get it to respond. After 10 minutes of messing about and three more freezes the subtitles finally went away.I know it's not my DVD player, as I've watched other discs with no problems. So be warned, this DVD is not well structured, and might freak out newer players, regardless of their quality."
2,Poor quality DVD,"Fine movie, but I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD. I already owned the VHS version of this movie and it was one of my kids' favorites. I bought the DVD to take advantage of the better sound and to get the widescreen format. Unfortunately, the quality of the print or the equipment used for the DVD transfer was awful. During the climactic scene where the lovers confront the bishop, there is visible dirt that shows up as a dark mark on the bishop's vestments. When I tried to clean my TV screen, I discovered the ""dirt"" was part of the DVD. Although the kids don't seem to mind, it drives me crazy."
3,likeable movie - horrendous music score,"I remember absolutely loving Ladyhawke when I first saw it in my teens. I caught it on cable the othe rnight however and realised that it hasn't really aged that well... Whereas the storytelling is not remarkable it is nevertheless an enjoyable film if you're a bit of a romanticist. The cast is well put together although Mouse may occasionally come across as too much of a cynical and fast talking 90's teen for my liking. Pfeiffer and Hauer gel well and the supporting cast do what is expected of them.Unfortunately this flick also features the worst music score I can think of and it is difficult to actually watch the movie without constantly getting annoyed by the soundtrack. In fact, when I think about is this atrociousness may be a reason in itself to watch the movie!"
5,wonderful,What a great romance. I watched it when I was younger and I think I enjoy it even more now. It was such a moving story that your heart just goes out to the characters.
3,"serviceable, but not great","Watchable film, certainly; but:1. Make sure you're not getting the fullscreen version, as I inadvertently did.2. Movie horribly dated by crude 80's-style music. Alas!3. Matthew Broderick is loveable but should not have been in this, if you think about it for a second. His role called for someone who was more wiry and less innocent-faced."
3,Epic fantasy,"Fantasy fans- ENJOY! The music is horrible... I rate the movie 3 stars due to the story alone. The effect, sound and vision is standard and a bit dated."
1,Wrong region?,"I bought this DVD and it won't play stating it is the ""Wrong Region"". What in the world does this mean. I recceived nothing for my money"
1,zaratim,"This started out as maybe something, but at the first sword-fight I lost interest; the music gave it away as just another piece of crap with a superhero with superhero stunts and superhero lines and superhero imagination required to believe it."
1,A big disappointment,"I remembered watching this movie as a child, and had high hopes that it would be an enjoyable medieval adventure. I was severely disappointed.The soundtrack was truly terrible. At the most inappropriate moments throughout the movie one would be beset by a cacophony of pounding 80s electronica. So distracting and overwhelming was it that it was easy to lose tract of the movie.The movie itself was appalling. The characters were flat and unbelievable, and good actors did not manage to carry poor dialogue. Oh dear."
5,great movie,It was very easy to buy. Plus it was easy to watch. The entire family loved it! Great movie. thank you!
2,Should state the language it's in,"I guess when you order online and it comes from Italy, one should not assume the language is in English. Very disapointed. This was a christmas present for my daughter. Maybe my next purchase for her will be an Italian/English dictionary."
4,Seems Alright.,"Someone I live with loves this movie. I thought it seemed alright. We didn't watch it to the end, though."
4,"Good Historical Fiction, Nice Visuals","As a medieval reenactor and sometime historian, I am always looking for more ""costume drama"" on video or DVD. ""Ladyhawke"" is a long-time favorite of mine. The fantasy storyline is at times a trifle overdone, but otherwise a good film. The costuming, fight choreography, cinematography ... all excellent. Worth a rental if nothing else."
5,great movie,I love this movie. This is one of the best love stories ever made on film. Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer have good chemistry at the end. I also enjoyed the performances of Leo McKern and Matthew Broderick.
4,A classic for every fantasy fan,"I've been a lifetime lover of fantasy movies, and when a friend asked me if I'd seen Ladyhawke (to which I had to reply no), I immediately went out and rented it. After one viewing, I have bought it. It's that good! The characters, from the delightful but mischievous Mouse to the dark, hateful Bishop, are well developed and really draw you into their story. A bit of a Romeo and Juliet story with a twist, if you enjoy fantasy movies or romance, you will want to see this one!"
5,A Cult Classic,"Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfieffer in a fairytale of lust, deceit, and endless love despite a heartless curse. I loved it when it first was released and it is a classic fairytale, always worth the rewind"
4,"Good, though not as good as I remember.","Ladyhawke, a classic and one of my all time favorites, was quite a disappointment after seeing it again recently. A young thief escapes from the dungeons of a city only to be saved from the clutches of the city guard by a mysterious warrior accompanied by a hawk. At night, however, he finds himself in the company of a beautiful lady and a mysterious wolf... The story, coincidently, unfolds in Aquila (where the earthquake recently struck) during the Middle Ages.In short, this is not the movie I remember from my childhood. Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeifer, and Matthew Broderick brought back memories, though it might have been better to avoid viewing the film again and instead holding on to those cherished childhood memories.The music is simply awful, the acting is horrid, and the dialogues are terrible (a B-movie by all standards), though the story is very good and it makes up, to a certain extent, for the film's setbacks. 3.5 Stars"
4,Soylent Dick Says: Good story; good fantasy,"Had never heard of this movie until I rented it two days ago. I thought it had a really good story, something which is often lacking in movies these days. The fantasy and romance aspects were, I thought, well done. In the end, the curse is undone, the bad guy gets his dues, and the lovers are reunited!I thought the acting of the male lead (Rutger Hauer) was a little understated. But then, it was SO refreshing to see a movie like this that wasn't full of arguing, yelling, and stupid, overdone special effects.The only irritating aspect is the character of Phillipe. Early in the movie, he talks too much, far more than a man on the run would. But his character improves as the story goes on.Good entertainment, especially if you like medieval-style fantasy."
4,CasSaver,"I loved this movie and when I received it, it was in great condition. Thank you for being so promte in delivering it."
1,Far Over-Priced!!!,"Fifty bucks for a no-frills, plain old DVD of Ladyhawke? I've always liked this movie, but GET REAL!!! Absolutely ridiculous. Some of the vendors on Amazon are completely delusional."
4,Love it,"This movie came out when I was 4, and as long as I can remember, I would always sit and watch it with my dad. I just bought this DVD and watched for the first time in years. I had forgotten just how much I enjoyed it. I'm so glad that I finally bought it so that I can enjoy it for many more years."
2,Yikes - ick,Wow the music is so mismatched that I couldn't get past the first 20 minutes or so. This is an older movie and the lack of technical quality definitely makes it look dated. Add to that the painfully weak dialog and acting (by some characters) and you have a potentially wasted two or so hours. Not my cup of tea.
5,it sent my heart aflutter,What more could you want? Magic? Broderick? Eighties hair and music that is clearly inconsistent with the medieval backdrop. Love it.
5,A timeless Hit!,"Our family never gets tired of watching this classic love story, it's got it all. We love this movie!"
5,Great movie,"I stumbled across this movie a while back on VHS, and have been trying to find it on DVD as my other copy was fried from overuse. Yes, it's an older film, but in the way of a medieval romance film, it's very good. Lots of twists and turns, the actors are very good, and the work with the animals is great as well. I knew Matthey Broderick from Ferris Beuler's Day Off, and this younger actor is great to see! If you're up for a good 80's action romance set with knights and a romantic curse, this would be the movie!"
4,Wonderful! But what a horrible soundtrack...,"I love this movie very much. I liked the film's storybook feel, and the theme of starcrossed lovers. The story is very charming. Isabeau is lovely- apprently vulnerable, but actually strong. Navarre is truly your knight in shining armor...and the thief and the monk are quite funny and enjoyable to watch. What makes viewing this movie painful is the terrible, unfortunate soundtrack. What were they thinking?? It sounds like it's straight out of one of those little Casio machines they used to sell at airports in the 80s. Even the music on some of those cheesy local furniture store ads that are broadcast on cable sound better! They should re-release this movie with a new soundtrack- as another reviewer said- something Celtic maybe- anything, but this! The four stars are for the movie- it would have been five, but for the soundtrack."
5,I saw it in the theater...,"when I was in high school. And I STILL love this movie. I don't get why everyone is critical of the soundtrack. IT WAS THE 80S!! Of course it's cheesy!Other than that, I fell in love with Rutger Hauer then, and still love him today. (Sigh) The setting, the romance, the passion and the laughs are as good today as they were to a high school junior then.S"
4,DXF,"The details are good, but the conversion from the Author's Mac-Based PowerCADD to AutoCAD are not that great. It assigns polylines to most every object with a global thickness. I found the DXF easier to work with. The user will have to explode the detail into the more primative objects in order to customize the detail. Finally, the software allows you to review the detail before pulling it up in your CAD software, however, it doesn't work UNLESS you move the details to the root drive. For example: I installed under the default directory C:\Program Files\Architectural Details. I matched the path in the detail program to where they were located on my drive and it did not work. The only way I could get it to work was by moving the DETAILS folder to the root drive- C:\Details. Once I did this and changed the path, it called up the details in the CADD program fine."
4,cute case,"This bag is the perfect size for my DMC-fx07. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it looks different than what the picture shows on here. Mine has a rectangular silver plate with"" Panasonic"" written on it instead of the oval one with ""Lumix"" written on it. Sure hope they sent me the right one. Box says they did. Anyone else have the same problem?"
4,Landmarks in Gay Musical History,"This is an interesting overview of gay-themed musicals from 1975-1995. Selections from '95's the Gay Nineties Musical(Billy Barnes beautifully sings and plays an energetic opening) and In The Blood, '94's The Ballad Of Little Mikey, '93's All That He Was and Aids! The Musical!(""Our 1st Christmas"" and ""I Don't Recall"" are standouts), '84's In Gay Company(Beverly Bremers shines in ""Ought To Be Married"" and ""Sondheim""), '81's Sparkles, '77's Joseph McCarthy Is Alive And Well And Living In Dade County(Amanda McBroom stands out in ""Poetry"") and Gulp!, and '75's Boy Meets Boy. The majority of selections are well written and performed. Some fine lost gems are included on the cd. This is a must for collectors."
5,great,my coworker wanted this movie so i was trying to help my coworker find this movie. it made him very happy thanx!!
4,"Rugged, if not a very believable tale.","Old stone-face doesn't get any stonier than this. He plays a trapper named Johnson (Canadian Rockies?, circa 1920s) who happens across a dog, half dead after a vicious dog fight, and takes it home and nurses it. The sleeze-ball owner, who sold the dog to Johnson, now has second thoughts and leads a posse to kill the trapper and retrieve his dog. After this goes awry, they enlist the aid of the local constable (Lee Marvin as a Mountie?) and the chase is on. Although the basic plot is too hard to swallow, the film has much to like, including some beautiful, rugged scenery and an outstanding performance from Lee Marvin. Between 1 and 10, ""Death Hunt"" gets a marginal 7."
4,Huh?,"My only question about this movie is: What in the world was the reasoning behind the casting of Angie Dickinson? Her appearance is not just extraneous, as was mentioned in a previous review, it was totally unecessary! The only reason had to be because she needed a job. Otherwise, this is a very good movie. Charles Bronson plays his usual strong character, which I always enjoy and Lee Marvin plays Millen with determination & humor. Glad to see it on DVD."
1,Defective. Had to return it :(,"The disc was defective, but not the seller's fault. It was ""new"", so the manufacturer was to blame. I am disappointed, but willing to give the seller another chance if the opportunity arises."
3,A good matinee flick...,"Seeing Marvin and Bronson together is great.What makes this film, and all of Bronson's post Death Wish films, is if you convince yourself this is actually Paul Kersey time travelling back to find peace of mind and he STILL won't get cut a break!! It makes sense when he comes back in Death Wish 3 & 5 and begins shooting everything that moves...the world is this man's enemy."
4,Don't mess with Bronson's dog!,"Bronson's back! This time his role is similar to the one he had in Chato's Land; A guy pursued by an angry mob wanting him dead, dead, Dead! Naturally, because he's Bronson, they don't have the easiest time trying to get him. These guys should have never shot his newfound dog friend, coz after that, all hell breaks loose. The plot is nothing new, it's been done many times before(usually with more style), but this one is exceptional because of the cast. Aside from Chuck, you have tough guy Lee Marvin, Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers who's always a joy), would-be Luke Skywalker-Andrew Davis, the ""dude"" talking cop from Death Wish 3, and the scary ""Buffalo Woman."" And to answer some of your questions, Peter Hunt(the director) was the editor of practically every James Bond film, and the director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. He passed away recently."
5,Great,"Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin remind us what real men, integrity, honor and heroes are supposed to be about.Great film LOOSELY based upon actual events."
3,not what I expected,This picture was a dissappointment to me. I expected something more and was not satisfied with the quality of the picture.
4,Great for a little kid movement class,I teach physical education at a preschool and this is the best CD I've found!
2,"Nice design, but cheap fabric and stitching","The design of the shirt looked nice online ... but for more than 30 bucks, it was a rip-off. The fabric is cheap and thin, the button threads are weak and look like they'll give out at any moment, and the logo on the back of the shirt is painted on as opposed to embroidery (this last bit really bugged me). All-in-all, this shirt makes for an interesting photograph ... but for a bowling shirt? Come on. It isn't built to take the stress of an evening out bowling with the gals."
3,Way big!,"Very cute but way, way big!! I hoped, since it is pink and says "" sister strikers"" on the back, that I was ordering a woman's small. What I got was very large for a men's small! It is a men's medium or perhaps even large. I think my husband could wear it. The image on the back is very cute, even though it is not stitched. The quality is good."
5,Great Portable Dictionary,"This dictionary is a wonderful combination of durability and utility. It fits perfectly into your back pocket and can take a lot of abuse. It's not the dictionary to choose as the only one that you have when studying a language - it's not extensive enough. But as something to travel with, a Langenscheidt Universal Dictionary is ALWAYS my first choice! (I have several different languages that have all gotten quite a bit of use.) The only drawbacks that I can think of for people looking for a reference when traveling (but have no training in the target language) is that this is not a ""phrase book"" and it is not very strong on ""restaurant words"" (spices, types of preparation, etc.) that you encounter on menus. But if you want an overall resource, and already have a basic knowledge of a language, this is a superb dictionary!"
1,Big lump of gunk...Recovery SA Powder,"The product (Recovery SA Powder) was supposed to be powder consistency. When I opened it, it was all stuck together in one big lump. I tried using a spoon to loosen some of the powder, and mixed it with some peanut butter. The dog wouldn't go near it. Then I tried to scrape more from the lump, but was unsuccessful. By the time I got around to showing it to my husband, who noticed that the moisture packet had burst (hence the lump), it was too late to get my money back (my fault, I know). The point is, I almost poisoned my dog (who was smart enough not to go near it). I was not happy with this product at all. Unfortunately, this experience made me not want to try another bottle. Hopefully the company will switch to a hard moisture packet so that this will never happen to anyone else. So, needless to say, I have no idea how effective or ineffective it is."
4,Election intrigue in France's deep south,"A superb step-by-step account of how to win the hearts and minds of the voters in a small country town. An atmosphere of brooding menace pervades the book as a ""creeping Jesus"" of a priest is brought in to swing the forthcoming election in favour of the government party. The short chapters make the book highly readable and wind up the tension marvellously. The one person who sees through the priest is powerless to act as his house and his whole life are gradually taken over - until the final cataclysmic scene when .... but I won't spoil it all by telling you what happens. A merciless and meticulous portrayal of the intrigues in a small French provincial town that deserves to be much better known than it is, this early work forms a pair with the following volume (number five) in the Rougon-Macquart saga ""La Faute De L'Abbé Mouret/The Sin Of Father Mouret"". The subject matter may not be attractive, but Zola has made it compelling reading."
4,.,"Lots of political intrigue, but the novel is also interesting, because here Rougons and Macquarts are cross-bred. As one can recall from the first novel ""La Fortune des Rougons/the Career of Rougons"", Pierre Rougon was never particularly fond of his twohalf-siblings, nonetheless, his daughter marries the son of his half-sister. Both die after loosing their sanity. It is a neurological disease that clearly was passed down to them from their grandmother. It sets Martha Rougon apart from her three brothers, two of whom were very practical. In general, all the neurological diseases are much more traceable among Macquarts than Rougons."
2,Not even close,"I have an SP600 that needed a new clutch, ordered this so-called kit! Expecting friction plates and clutch plates in the kit is too much.All that you get is clutch plates in this ""kit"". Had to order friction plates ""additional 40.00"" when this is advertised and priced at whole kit pricing, don't do it."
1,Many inaccuracies,This book is interesting but there are many incorrect descriptions and photo identifications. Does not contain many details. NOT recommended if you want accurate information.
3,tough film,"Although a bit dated, this film is a good detective flic. A bit hard at times but life is not full of roses either. Both Frank Sinatra and Lee Remick peform very well. The plot evolves around the detective, his values and his personal life. One should note that the transfer no the dvd is not the best possible as there are few problems with the sound and picture quality.All in all a decent film which could be described also as neo-noir."
5,the detective,as the tough cynical detective frank sinatra shines. he solves the case and watches as the guilty man is put to death. later his world is shaken to its core as he uncovers evidence that shows he was wrong and has sent an innocent man to his death. can he now base his life and his rising career on a lie? the answer is as shocking as the question. a must see movie.
5,dvd the detective,This was not my first viewing of the film. I loved it or would not have paid $25.00 to own it.
1,"it sucked big, fat, hairy, weiners.",if u liked u r gayif your not down with that i only have one word for ya...SOCKO
1,Its not all bad..............just not that good.,"Well I got this CD and I thought it was going to be the actual songs but I later found out that the songs were poorly done and it sounded like absalutly no effort went into it.If you want this album I warn you that you can buy WWF the music vol.2,3,4,5,Full Metal the Album,and the WCW Mayhem and get a whole bunch more songs and great quality sound"
2,"not really THAT bad, but ultimately falls short.","Yeah, most of the songs are not quite as good as the originals (especially Val and Gangrel--those ones pretty much suck). However, there are a few good ones like Goldust, Austin, and Mankind (despite some really strange voiceovers)...Unfortunately, for the makers of the CD, those ones (among others) are available on official WWF records. There are a couple songs that were previously unreleased by anyone, such as NWO, Goldberg, Al Snow, Lex Luger, and the WWF Ric Flair theme. This version of Al's song sucks, Flair's is OK, and Lex's and NWO are pretty good actually. Goldberg's is perfect...I have a sneaking suspicion that they snagged the Goldberg theme off some public domain source--it's practically indentical to the one you hear on WCW broadcasts. This CD may be worth it if you really want some songs of WCW stars, and this disc would be a great buy if they focused on WCW songs. However, if you want WWF themes, then go with the official CD's..."
1,Rip-off Artists,All the songtracks on this disc are cheap knockoffs. It's very misleading when it comes to the title. Stay away at all cost. I give this crud a 0 out of 10.
1,Could it get any worse?,"If anyone thinks that just because this thing is a wrestling CD makes it good, then they deserve to be tied to the Undertaker's symbol. This is the worst piece of trash I have even had the displeasure of wasting twelve bucks on. I will say this...it makes a great coaster or frisbee!"
1,This is not worth one penny.,These arent even the real themes. If your looking for Al Snows theme or WCW themes you'll have better luck taping them off of the internet from wrestling sites. WCW plans on releasing a cd in the future so just wait for that one. YOu'll be wasting your money on this cd...unless of course you dont mind music that isnt even close to the real ones.
1,True Wrestling Fans WILL Know The Difference,This is the worst imitation of wrestling theme songs I have ever heard!Get WWF the music Volume 3 if you want to hear real themes. The only songs that sound right are Goldberg's and Lex Luger. This is a good CD for begining wrestling fans.
4,I like wwf and it has wwf but wcw takes 1 star away from it,"This is a great cd but the wwf'3rd cd is alot more worth it. This one dosn't have all the awsome wrestling hits,it has WCW trash,but I do like the wwf in it."
3,"An ok CD for wrestling fans, but not great.","I saw this and thought they were the real themes but once I got it home, I only had to hear the first 2 seconds of the nWo theme (Track 1) and I knew I was greatly mistaken. The Mankind theme is annoying because they used the same talking style as in WWF Vol. 2. The theme that sounds most exact is probably Flair's theme. Otherwise it's an ok CD"
3,You're better off buying WWF The Music Volume 3,The two best songs are #1 and #3 but if you wanna hear something original I would recommend this to any wrestling fan!!!
2,I'm Slammin' This In The Trash,"I was expecting this to be offical music, but it is just some recreations by an amature band. You'd be better off purchasing WWF The Music Volume 3!"
2,Knowledge for Knowledge's Sake,"Detailed and well researched, Christopher Hitchens unveils a small pamphlet on the life and work of George Orwell, but he rarely explains the significance of Orwell's politics as they relate to the contemporary world. Hitchens is a fine journalist and he compiles some interesting information on Orwell's experiences in Spain, India, and elsewhere, but he rarely provides in-depth political/literary analysis of the man, preferring instead to subject the reader to mildly interesting anecdotes involving various luminaries in the literary/political world. Why Orwell Matters is a minor work, it may interest curious readers who've read 1984 and Animal Farm and would like to know more, but it's far from a serious study."
3,Okay book but too deep for average reader.,Hitchens is famous for quoting and referencing throughout his writings but way too covoluted and academic for curious readers. Hopefully the have cliff notes for this book.
3,Orwell Would Object,"Hitchens has contributed a lot of valuable works to society and he's certainly got the right idea here - in defending Orwell from unjustified attack. He sings his praises but he uses a voice far too obscure for all but a select group to understand. Orwell was a true socialist - his work was given to the people and in so doing, he helped to make our world a better, less corrupt, place. Hitchens is trying to do the same, I think, but he's reached a level in his own thinking that is over the heads of most people and he needs to come back down - not dumb it down, just remember the simplicity that Orwell weaved his terrific tales and essays with. It's the only way to get through... and matter."
1,Good Title,"Hitchens longa, vita breva. If your really want to know why Orwell matters, just read Orwell's essay ""Politics and the English Language."" Then try to watch most TV Newspeak without upchucking.Orwell remains his own best defense. My commendations to Mr. Hitchens for his good taste and excellent title."
3,Hitchens on Orwell,"Although far from a magesterial work of biography, of which it has no pretensions, ""Why Orwell Matters"" provides a highly readable background to Orwell's life and works. The structure of the book falls somewhere between a political treatise and a memoir of how Orwell has influenced Hitchen's own political views.Hitchens does well when situating Orwell into the political debates of the day, but routinely dips into petty score-settling whereupon the book strays into insider gossip of the mid-Twentieth Century left intellectual scene.On the whole, an easy read that does serve to illuminate the thinking behind Burmese Days and 1984 - well worth it."
4,The truth about the truth,"In this book Hitchens demonstrates to us the continuing relevance of a person who always kept an open mind and stayed true to principles. Throughout his career Orwell kept free of the ideological blindness that justifies so many sins by that one condemns in some but justifies in others in the name of serving a 'higher truth'. While clearly of the left he never blindly accepted its many sins in the name of some abstract greater good, or ultimate triumph. This book reminds us all of the necessity to keep an open eye and mind regardless of what our views are, or who we see as our natural allies."
3,Short but abstruse,"Hitchens can make most things interesting and readable, which is why I chose to read this book at all. However, I found this book to be a bit more esoteric than I would have wanted. It seems to have been written more for the true disciples of Orwell (or Hitchens), whom Hitchens clearly regards highly."
5,Why Orwell Matters!,Christopher Hitchens in elegant form describes to us the life of Orwell and why Orwell still matters in contemporary form. Truly a beautiful exposé that highlights to the reader the lasting influence and importance of George Orwell.
3,Horace and Morris Join the Chorus,This was a great Because it shows that avery one is good at something. Becuase Horace can sing high notes and Morris can sing low notes. But there friend Dolores just sings notes that no one had ever heard before. So he gets cut from the chorus because and just cant sing at all. so he writes a letter to teachers. Saying he loves to sing. Then the teacher reades it and its a peom so he lets Dolores sing it in the concert.
3,The Singing Trio,"Horace and Morris are two talented singers. Dolores decides to for the three of them to join the school chorus. Now, the only problem is, is that Dolores can't really sing that well. Horace sings the high notes, Morris sings the low notes, and Dolores just sings off key.After trying out in front of Moustro Provolone, Horace and Morris make the ""team"", but Dolores gets cut. Dolores starts feeling sad for herself, but pulls through and thinks up a way to get into the chorus. After writing a letter to Moustro Provolone, he realizes her true talent, and invites her to help him."
4,"Horace, Morris, and Dolores in a Chorus Cause Such Tzurris","A nice rhymed lesson that there is a place for everyone in a chorus, after the cheesy Moustro gets convinced. Horace and Morris sing well, Boris and Chloris listen fine, but Dolores, well Dolores is another story."
3,Good quality product,"Arrived on time in good condition. Product quality is good. For a small turntable like this, the price is too high though. Seemed like they took advantage of the situation people generally buy this product in."
4,months,"I've heard the whole album, top notch.Stephens production skills are always on point. I ordered this cd months ago whats the deal?"
3,My favorite Spider,"Being a huge Ziggy Stardust fan, found myself very intrigued by Mick Ronson's solo offerings,which I must admit had gone unheard by me since the original release.I've seen it lately going for ridiculous prices,as I believe it had been out of print until just very recently (at least domestically).Boy, am I glad I was patient and didnt fork over a fortune for it! The previous reviewer is spot-on in regards to these being decent enough songs,if not exactly destined for many repeat listens.One can hear the faint ghost of the Spiders of Mars wafting thru several of these tracks,and for that im happy to have finally picked this up for my collection. So I guess what im saying is that this is mostly for the completists,though I suspect the 70's Glam Rock obsessives (are their any of those left?!?)will find this of interest as well."
3,USB Keyboard - strange layout of some keys,"Nice feeling keyboard...a good tactile feel. However, the ins,del,home,end, and the arrow keys are all kinda mushed together in a strange way. Also on the 10-digit pad on the right, the 0 key is 1/2 size. It feels kinda odd at first but you *do* get used to it. I still have an occasional typo or have to look for the del key. Alas."
1,Took too long,"Received an e-mail stating Advil would be shipped in 2 days, received it about 3 weeks later.Also the price I paid was more then the price quoted when ordering. Have order Advil many times, this is the first time I had a problem."
4,A great book that was hard to put down...,"""Danegeld"" was a book that was pretty much unputdownable for me. The pacing was perfect and the story line was interesting, but at times a bit unnerving. There was a lot violence in this story and a part of me had trouble embracing the hero, Karn. The book opens to Karn and his Viking friends attacking a village. Some of the things that he not only participated in, but turned a blind eye to, put a bad taste in my mouth. However, there is a definite change in him as the story progresses and you can see him looking back on his past behavior with regret. In the end, I wanted him to have his beloved Britta. I was happy when they overcame their numerous obstacles to be together.All in all, this could have been a 5 star read, but I knocked off a star for some of my personal feelings towards Karn and the sometimes lengthly separtions of the central characters."
4,What a story!,"I bought this book as it was recommended by a romance novel critique. I wasn't disappointed. This is a moving story that I will keep and re-read for a very long time. Those wanting to loose themselves in a well woven love story with the beliefs, superstitions and fear of the 'dark ages', this is the book for you."
5,I suggest ya poot on a tie! :),"This is one of the few DVDs out there (especially a comedy DVD) that has all of the extras a DVD should have.There is an option to listen to director Mel Brooks talk about the movie while you're watching it (the movie volume during this is near silent while he's talking). I suggest you watch the movie twice: once to concentrate on the movie and another time to concentrate on Mel's comments.There are also several bloopers and deleted scenes. You should watch the deleted scenes first because most of the bloopers are from the deleted scenes.The DVD also includes both theatrical and TV commercial trailers.AND, there are several dozen behind-the-scenes photos from different parts of the movie.Don't speak English? Then how did you get this far? (ba dum bum) :) Actually, the DVD also translates in Spanish and French.For those looking for easter eggs, I haven't found any yet either.If you love to laugh, this is a must have dvd.Enjoy!"
4,Young Frankenstein,"Great movie, now on DVD, the people in this classic BW film from 1974 was overlooked by the critics and is a super funny film. Brooks and his team of writers were at their top and really delivered the belly laughs. If you have no sense of humor, I now you are out there, stay away. This is for people that like to laugh together and understand the characters of science fiction genre.GOOD DAY"
3,Can't stay awake,I've never seen this film from start to finish. I've fallen asleep each time. Need coffee!
3,OK MOVIE,"I gave it three stars for the plot because it was a good movie. But I didn't find it very amusing. I laughed a few times, but it just wasn't my idea of a Mel Brooks comedy. Especially since I read the reviews here before I purchased it and really expected something along the quality of 'Blazing Saddles' or 'History of The World'.But, in defense of the movie, I believe that had I been a fan of horror movies, I would have loved it. I'm into comedies and westerns - no scary movies in my collection.I can only imaging how funny I would have found it had I been a Frankenstein fan."
3,Whole Grain,"If you're a fan of classic horror, this is a good one to have. In an apparent attempt to replicate the technique of the original Universal horrors, this film is INCREDIBLY grainy. I saw the film first run on a big screen and I don't remember it being THIS grainy. It's like the whole thing is infested by billions of swarming gnats. I'm all for the director's intent, but geez. Also, this being Mel Brooks, the humor is (of course) quite ham fisted."
2,Bad Disc,"5-Stars to this movie. My very favorite Comedy. 5-Stars to Amazon.com's Customer Service. Their return policy is the best. Now to my problem with this Blu-Ray release. It will not play on my Panasonic BR player. It will get to the Main menu, but when I click Play, it will just set there and go no farther. I even tried going through Scene selection and it still will not go no farther after clicking on any scene selected. I returned it for a replacement and received another one. Same problem. I returned for refund and plan on buying it later after this batch of defective Blu-Rays are used up. I have my player updated with the lastest drivers and have not experienced this problem with any of the others in my extensive collection of Blu-Rays."
5,love this movie,i thought that this movie was funny when i frist saw it when i was about 18 teen and it still is love it
5,"""Abby Normal"".."" you put an Ab Normal Brain into my monster""","Young Frankstein is a classic spoof. Mel brooks and Gene Wilder takes a horror classic and turns into a witty and sharp comedy. strring some of the great comedians..Widler,Kahn..not to mention a great cameo by gene hackman. This is a must for just a laugh and just to see a great comedians and a great comic director."
4,"Y.F. and Holy Grail dbl. feature Cinedome Orange, CA '75","I could handle Gene Wilder's obnoxious loud voice in this one, it works. Chocolate Wonka Wonka is the other. Marty Felman is The Best! what a freak! and English too whatever that means. FAV PART... the line - Dr.F: Are you trying to make me look like a fool? from the stage show. Teri Garr is HOT! Go to a T.G. website or imdb NOW!"
5,My Favorite Movie,"First of all, this is my all time favorite movie. It may shock readers of this review to know that I am only 17 years old. The movie was shipped to me quickly and without any flaws. The quality of the HD is well worth the price for those that enjoy this movie or any other Mel Brooks film. The movie is funny, and the bonus features on the disk are a real bonus."
5,Young Frankenstein,I really likes this movie from just seeing it on tv and now that I have it I am just so satisfied with it. I would recomend it to anyone who has seen Willy wonka and the chocolate factory becasue Gene Wilder is amazing in this film. Anyone who wants a comedy and a classic this is your movie!!! Young Frankenstein!
5,Great Comedy,This movie will keep you in stitches. A laugh per minute. Great stars and a very funny storyline. If you love to laugh this dvd will not let you down.
5,Always a Favorite,"This movie is such a classic spoof on horror flicks! Assembling Leachman, Kahn, Wilder and Feldman had to be brilliant. Each brings their own outrageous twist to their characters. Love it!!!!"
5,AN OLD ONE BUT A GOOD ONE,"EXCELLENT! very clear, sound perfect, very enjoyable after having seen it manyyears ago. Glad to add it to our collection. accurate mailing dates as well."
4,A Classic,This movie is a classic. I bought it for my daughter to see. The movie is done in black and white photography which enhances its effect. It is a spoof on the old Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein movies and I love it. Many of the scenes make me laugh. It also has a great cast and spectacular staging. This DVD is a comedy classic for one's collection; it is a keeper.
4,Young Frankenstein,The video was in perfect condition and they were quick to deliver it. I would order from them again.
5,Young Frankenstein,RENTED THIS MOVIE ALMOST EVERY YEAR SINCE IT CAME OUT. DECIDED I WANTED TO FINALLY OWN IT. THIS ISONE OF MEL BROOKS BEST !
5,One of my favorites,"This is one of the best movies ever made. Mel Brooks does it again.If you like Mel, you willl love this one."
5,Young Frankenstein,I love this movie and I now have it on DVD. I love Halloween and truly enjoy having movies to watch during the month of October in preperation for Halloween.
5,One of the finest comedies ever made,"The other reviews have summarized this film's qualities quite well, so I won't repeat them. Instead, I'll simply say that this is, bar none, my favorite comedy ever. I've watched it so many times that I know the entire script by heart, and I still laugh every time I see it. I recommend this film unconditionally. It is sheer brilliance. Buy it. Enough said."
5,Hysterical!,"This is one of the funniest movies of all time. Gene Wilder, Teri Garr, Peter Boyle, and more. You can't go wrong. A classic to watch on Halloween for a satirical view of the old Halloween classics. Definitely recommend!"
5,This is one of the funniest hoor movies ever made.,"This is a real classic, and it stands on its own, although it pairs up nicely with Bride of Frankenstein on a stormy night."
4,Fun movie,"It's a fun movie to see. The grandson of Dr. Frankenstein inherits thecastle of his famous relative and goes to live there. He ends up doingthe same work as the grandfather. This young Dr Frankenstein is also a scientist. Although the movie is a comedy, the young Dr Frankenstein hasa dry humor and is not silly. He is assisted by a hunchback who is prettysilly though. He is also assisted by a good looking young lady. A lot ofthe jokes have sexy overtones. The monster is not a bad guy really. Itis a good comedy. If you looking for an entertaining movie this is a goodchoice."
5,Mel Brooks Did It Again!,"Even though Gene Wilder wrote the script Mel Brooks had to be convince to do the movie. The lines are classic and you are hammered with one joke on top of the other. This is Marty Feldman's best role which steals away your attention of the story several times. The chemistry of the actors is so like situation comedy but strong. The ending has you smiling and giggling on your way out of your seat when you go to eject the DVD or tape from your matchine. If you like this you will love ""Blazing Saddles"" also by Mel Brooks."
2,"Okay, Mel Brooks fans, bring on your ""no"" votes for my review!!","I rented this movie after not seeing it since it first came out. Guess I would have been in high school at the time and I remember liking it a lot more then than I did this time around. Not surprising, either. The humor is mostly pretty juvenile and predictable. There are, indeed, some funny bits in it (e.g., the horse whinnying every time they say the name of Cloris Leachman's character, Marty Feldman as Igor), but the sex jokes are pretty lame and trite, and the rest of the humor rarely made me laugh, just the occasional smile. Though it may have been ground-breaking in its day, it just hasn't aged well."
3,Maybe you have to see it more than once,"I bought the DVD on the strength of the reviews and maybe my expectations were too high, but I didn't find this film consistently hilarious on first viewing. It's actually kind of an odd mix of serious story-telling and spoof. I will watch it again, though, as I suspect it's one of those films that grow on you."
3,One of Mel Brooks' best,"As far as Mel Brooks films goes, this is one of his best, maybe only surpassed by ""Blazing Saddles"". Unfortunately, Mr. Brooks lost his touch over the years and his movies showed it, getting worse and worse with each release. His older movies tend to be his best.Gene Wilder plays Dr. Friedrich von Frankenstein, grandson of the infamous Victor Frankenstein. Friedrich, now living in the U.S., travels to his now-deceased grandfather's European castle. It is there where he feels trapped by his grandfather's legacy and possibly his own destiny to continue his monstrous work. From then on, it's pure comedy."
3,"Great movie, graininess is a major problem.","This movie is of course, a venerable classic and is most certainly my personal favorite. I have to agree with the other reviewers commenting on the excessive graininess of the movie and it is really unacceptable. If you would like a comparison of a blu-ray black and white, watchThe Longest Day [Blu-ray] in blu-ray. The graininess almost looks like a surface graininess; almost like it is an ""overlay"" (for lack of a better word) on the film. Some shots are very clear however, which leads me to believe the source material is capable of producing a very clear and crisp version; maybe someday. Aside from the extras, I'm not sure this offers anything more than the standard version, especially if you have DVD player that will up-convert.I am rather surprised it passed muster before being released but go figure. And don't forget, ""Put the candle back!""."
5,"Voodshtops, voodshtops!","I just can't think of a funnier movie. There is some slapstick, but it is the wit that carries this one. Kenneth Mars is the true unsung hero here. I break out laughing everytime i watch the town meeting scene in which we are introduced to him. Peter Boyle is hilarious without having to say a word though out most of the movie, check out his eye movements."
3,"""This DVD needs a new Special Edition""","I've had this DVD for about 5 years, and I have to say that it needs a ""NEW"" Special Edition. (1) It needs a anamorphic tranfer, watching it on my widescreen TV does not do this movie justice. (2) It needs new audio, a mono soundtrack is good if you're watching using your TV speakers. Give it a Dolby/DTS 5.1 this film deserves it. (3) ""Making Sense of... "" is great, but what about the FOX Channel special that aired for it's 25th Anniversary that would be a great addition. (4) The deleted scenes are in 4:3. Did Mel shoot them that way, I don't think so. Present them the way they were shot in 16:9. (5) The trailers should be in widescreen (some are, and some are'nt). Bottom line ""Young Frankenstein"" needs a ""NEW"" Special Edition, come on FOX you release that same crap over and over, do we really need another DVD release on ID4- I think NOT.BrianPhiladelphia, PA"
4,Homage to Horror,"This is probably Mel Brook's finest work, though some might vote for Blazing Saddles or the Producers. Not me, though. I'll take this one. In a tribute to the old horror movies of yore, Brooks puts together the perfect cast to carry it out. Gene Wilder as Dr. Frankenstein (pronounced FRONKENSTEEN), Marty Feldman as Igor (pronounced EYEGORE), Teri Garr as the lab assistant Inga, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, and my personal favorite from the movie Madeline Khan. Her scene with Marty Feldman standing at the doorway of the castle and the one where she saunters into the bedroom looking like Elsa Lanchester are both absolute total screams. The great thing about the cast is the fact that they all are in total flow with the movie and with each other. The DVD has many extra features which makes it miles ahead of the VHS tape."
5,BRILLIANT,"Mel Brook's ""Young Frankenstein"" is inspired in every respect, from casting, to scripts, sets, actors, direction, etc; it is timeless in every sense of the word. The material is as funny now as it was then with Wilder and Feldman dishing out some of the funniest dialogue ever penned. Madeline Cahn as Elizabeth is a triumph as is Cloris Leachman's Frau Bluecher. Not a weak link in the cast or in the entire film. Shot in glorious black and white using the actual laboratory set James Whale used in the original ""Frankenstein."" I never tire of this film and goodness knows I've seen it countless times. Teri Garr, Peter Boyle and Gene Hackman are each absolutely wonderful in their respective roles. Not to be missed. In the event that you're only familiar with the more recent Mel Brooks movies (sadly enough, all dreadful) and wondering why he is considered a legend in the film industry, watch ""Young Frankenstein"" and you'll understand just exactly why he is deserving of that title."
5,Still Laughing After All These Years!,"I can honestly say that i've seen this film at least 100X and it never gets old. Wanted this film in my collection and finally got it with the added bonus of the OUTTAKES. They just don't make films like this anymore. I love when it is evident that the actors are having just as much fun making the film as I did watching it. Wilder, Kahn, Boyle, Feldman et al were great. Worth having in your film library as one of the all time great comedies."
5,Still Cracking me up!,"This movie is 36 years old but Mel Brooks' shamelessly absurd sense of humor holds up very well. Most of the bits and gags are readily understood, but I have never quite ""gotten"" the connection between the mention of Frau Blucher's name and the reaction of the horses. This is absolutely one of the funniest pictures ever made!"
5,168 Reviewers Can't Be Wrong,"This film has been lauded ad nauseum. If your still not convinced it is worth the purchase, well, get it anyways. And that goes for those of you who already have seen it 12,000 times. Do you need to buy it? No. But you really should, because one night you will sitting there, and wish you had it. So get it. Word."
3,Lukewarm,"This will be short and to the point - I was not overwhelmed by this movie. I saw it live in the movie theatre and now own it on DVD, but frankly, despite the rave reviews by so many other critics, I simply do not find this movie ""hilarious"".It is well acted, (terrific cast!) well-directed, and the sets are fantastic, but the jokes are so tongue-in-cheek and so laid-back that they failed to move me to laughter. I did smile a few times, but over all, I was not overwhelmed by this 1970's comedy.Sorry I disagree with the majority, but as far as comedies go, this gets just 3 of 5 stars from me.Jim Koenig"
4,"A ""Must Have"" Classic","I've loved this movie since the first time that I saw it. Gene Wilder has always been one of my favorite actors. My favorite scene in the movie is when Gene and the ""Monster"" dance to Putting on the Ritz. This movie always makes me laugh and feel better about the world. This was a movie that I had to get for my collection of classics."
5,"Yes, this really was the funniest movie ever!","Wow! I absolutely loved this movie. It spoofed just about every other Frankenstein movie that I have seen. Marty Feldman as Igor was my personal favorite. He was perfect for the witty lab assistant who has a hump that changes sides. Gene Wilder was also a very fresh, yet believable, Frankenstein and has been able to carry on the great tradition of Frankenstein and of spoofs. I watched this movie primarily for the humor, but now I also have a much greater appreciation for the Frankenstein movies as well. This is definetly a movie for all of the Frakenstein junkies, but also for people who love to laugh. Lots."
5,THIS IS ONE AWESOME FILM!,THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST DVD I HAVE. EXTRA BLOOPERS A COMMENTARY. THIS IS WHY I BOUGHT DVD.
5,An Almost Perfect Movie,"Hilarious performances by every cast member and a great screenplay. This is one of the funniest Mel Brooks films ever, exceeded in my opinion only by The Producers. Gene Wilder considers Young Frankenstein his best role ever."
5,One of the best comedies made,"This is one of my son's (adult) favorite movies. He and his wife are always quoting lines from it and I bought it as a birthday present. Like Rhett Butlers ""Scarlett I don't give a damn"" there are so many lines in this that are repeated over and over amid lots and lots of laughter. Definitely worth adding to video collection.Young Frankenstein (Special Edition)"
2,What the Heck !?!?!?!?!?!?,I usually love Mel Brooks movies and I'm a huge fan of Get Smart from TV - I even have the box set :) But this movie sucked! I wasn't even born when it was made and it felt like all the jokes were so cliched when I watched it. Now there could be 2 reasons for that - Number 1 is that this film was so influential that every other movie copied it so I had already heard the jokes a million times before or Number 2 - The jokes actually were cliched. Either way I didn't really enjoy this like I wanted to. I'm still keeping it though - although if I run out of room in my new DVD holder this is going in the trash first thing.
1,Does't work,"The first 50 mins. of this DVD worked fine, then it gets stuck and won't play any further. Great if you like watching 3/4 of a movie."
2,Funniest Movie Of All Time?!!!!!!,"I bought this movie after reading reveiws on ebay and also reading reveiws elsewhere claming it was one of the funniest movies ever. I was very disapointed with this movie, Laughs where very scarce. Itmay be funny to Frankenstein fans, but being born it the 80's, I have never seen a classic frankenstein movie. I have seen Abbott and Costello Meets Frankenstein, and Carry on Screaming, both of wich I found to be far more humerous than this movie. If you are a huge Frankenstein Fan or a Mell Brooks Fan you may like this movie, but anyone else I would recomend that you try before you buy (rent)."
2,mundane comedy,"i don't usually disagree with the general concensus of reviewers, but this time it's personally unavoidable. i viewed this film for the first time this past weekend after purchasing it. i considered it to be very mundane for comedy. the contradiction in terms is intentional. i may have been amused to the extent of laughing twice throughout the entire film. if this is any example of Mel Brook's greatest comical acheivement then his brand of humor is assinine at best. this one would have have played better as a dramatic remake of the original. sorry Mel, you're just not funny.as for the the DVD, it has enough extras to satisfy fans of this supposed comic film director/producer."
3,Blu-Ray DVD Is Not Color Version,I think this is a really good comedy movie. I've been waiting a while now to find a color version. I was disappointed to recieve a B&W version even though the product description says it's color. The extra features are a hoot though.
1,Undisputed king of overrated.,"Maybe I can't appreciate this in its historical context. Maybe it just hasn't aged well. Here's an example of a ""gag"" from this film ""Were wolf? There wolf!"" If you think that's funny, you'll love this. It wasn't painfully bad, but I sat through the entire movie and didn't feel the slightest urge to smile let alone laugh. Nope. Just watched it and dutifully noted the lame attempts at word play. I know I'm in the minority here, but hey- that's my opinion."
3,Young Frankenstein,Friend ordered movie. Not my t ype but he liked it. Thanks for coming thru for him again. You find the hardest one ever.
5,Put Zee Candle Back,"Hands down, one of the best movies ever made. Every scene is great. Every character is perfect. I consider every actor and actress in this flick some of the best comedians ever. Mel Brooks is truly a gifted man when it comes to great ideas for spoofs. I can't imagine ANYONE not having seen this masterpiece, but if for some reason you haven't, see it TODAY!"
3,Funny yet old humor,For the time this was made this was a spoof of a good movie. The jokes could have been better but still a good watch.
4,Young Frankenstein,"A first-rate production in all respects except for one drawback scene where the master and the monster put on a semi-revoiting song and dance act. Otherwise, the humor was tops."
3,"Delightful work, better executed in 1953 on EMI","This Ozawa recording is fine if it's all you can get and don't know the work, which is a real gem, a must for anyone who appreciates Poulenc's blend of the bittersweet and the boulevard. It's useful also for the sound quality, which reveals the details of the score. But for Parisian style, for idiom - and incidentally for diction, pace the Australian reviewer - the 1953 recording under André Cluytens, with the supremely chic Denise Duval perfect in the title role, can't be beaten - if you can find it..."
5,good cd,"por fin puedo tener este cd tenia solo los dos y me faltaba este para mi colecion hoy por din lo pude ocmprar en amazon y por buen precio menos de 5 dolares comprar en amazon es lo mejor q me puede pasar,,,"
3,learn the zone system,"Ansel Adams was a master of photography but not the most exciting storyteller , in my opinion.This book is one that you should read as part of a complete education in photography, but there are some long sections in it. The parts of the book explaining Adams' zone system are very worthwhile and great stuff. Much of the rest of the book is only interesting if you are shooting film (not digital), as it deals specifically with darkroom processing.Read about the zone system here or somewhere else, but learn it. If you are a film photog, read this whole book. For digital shooters, you might want to read only the sections of interest."
5,I think i've got what I wanted.,"I bought this book for the photos inside. They seem to be well printed, adjusted as closely as possible to the right greyscales. Good. I need time to study it."
5,Lear From the Master,Ansel Adams is arguably the finest technician in the history of photography. This book covers the art and science of creating the perfect negative - the vital ingredient in making a perfect print. This book does not disappoint. Ansel's genious lives through this and other books he helped write. This book is a valuable asset to any photographic library.
5,Ansel Adams' The Negative is the Best,"Not much to say. You want to know everything about the Zone System or exposure, this is IT."
5,Excellent knowledge and informative,excellent information on understanding photography. Touch on zone system and exposure.
1,Junk,"POS! This plastic piece of junk is poorly made, and without even basic features, it has a small tinny sound and no output from the turntable. Frankly I'm surprised they still stock this stinker."
5,Top quality.,"Sticking with Sony CD-R's & DVD+R's for now on. Seller offers a quality product that arrives fast. Was very disappointed wtih the quality of 2 spools of Memorex CD-Rs which I had purchased from OTHER brick-and-mortar stores in my area. (More than 1/2 of their discs wouldn't read or burn, & Memorex ignored my email on the matter.) This seller offers a product you can trust. I haven't had any problems burning onto the discs; and they play everywhere--in my car, stereo, laptop, even on my sister's finicky eMac. I don't think you'll be disappointed with this vendor's Sony brand discs."
5,none others come close,"Sony is the best. None other kinds come close to the quality and dependability of the Sony cd-R audio cd's. Sony data cd's are equally as good, and better than those others usually seen on store shelves. I have burned about 500 Sony audio cd's and every one is supurb. I sampled others but now buy only Sony. When found in stores, (rarely), the price is usually much much higher than on Amazon."
1,error in picture,The product is Sony MUSIC CDs but the picture shows Sony AUDIO CDs. They are two different things and are not interchangeable.
4,Belongs on DVD,"I love this move, Tommy lee Jones is great in this movie. This is a movie that must come out for DVD in the near future. In the 80's it was HBO biggest movie."
5,THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE!!!!,THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. IT HAS SUPERB ACTING. THIS IS A MUST OWN FOR ALL MOVIE GOERS.
1,A real disappointment compared to previous issues,"While the feature articles are in now color, there are not as many of them - a loss. The catalog section omits guns that were introduced during last winter's cycle of trade shows, etc. (e.g. Ruger KP345, Ruger Mk III)."
4,Satisfied,I received the book within the time indicated for delivery and it's in very good condition.
4,excellent,"I would have preferred a more rugged leather. This a soft leather, but perfect for what I wanted. Excellent product."
5,If Talent Were All,"I only recently heard Patti Shaffner for the first time singing live at the Miller Beach Cafe. It is such a thrill to hear a voice like Patti's live. I felt like I was discovering a vocalist of star quality. If I was a recording company executive, I'd sign her on the spot. This album by Patti and a backup band of superb musicians, is as fine a taste of this talent as I would hope to hear. This is a great, sophisticated jazz album, an intimate concert of standards and Patti's own original and beguiling songs. I'm only sorry she hasn't recorded another full program of songs since this one. I want to hear more from this jazz stylist! I want to share her and her musicians with everyone. Believe me, if talent were all it took to be a household name, Patti would be that kind of star."
5,One of my favorites,"This movie is about courage, heart, fight, that most Americans (*if any) just don't have. An icon of the military for student soldiers is taken hostage by the students after it is closed but elite students take it a step further. When they are confronted with force they start to loose moral after various demeaning events happen. It's a sad movie. Even with everything crashing down they still remain structured and under control until towards the end. If this movie was about dope or gangs it would be a classic in America but unfortunatly only a few of us can enjoy it for what it's worth."
4,A must -see for young leaders!,Taps is a powerful reminder of how youthful passions can lead to disastrous results if misguided or led out of context. Very good acting by Tim Hutton and George C. Scott. Also a glimse of young Tom Cruise.
5,Perfect Condition,Everything was as expected. Arrived as expected and played as expected. I don't know what more that I can say.
4,Review of Taps,"The movie was good and the characters were excellent however, the movie ended on a sad note which was why I rated the movie this way."
4,Taps is worth watching.,"If you are a military buff, or a fan of Tom Cruise, Sean Penn, or George C. Scott, then this is the movie for you. Very interesting plot, (honor, duty, country) patriotic, some action, but seems to drag along at times. Great movie to watch if you have nothing to do."
2,TAPS - WORKS AGAINST ITSELF,"The movie TAPS works against itself.It portrays the kids as villians, yet also as heroes.Do you cheer for these kids, boo them, or what?If you want the kids to be heroic, make them heroes. If you want the kids to be villianous, make them villians.You cannot have it both way."
3,Wrong color!,"The shears are great, I bought them as an intended replacement for my Cuisinart kitchen shears.Be warned though, these are not even close to black - they are a light gray. I had to return the item for this reason."
4,Works on a Mac with Jaguar,"I just received my mouse from Amazon, with amazingly fast free shipping. Plugged it into my IOGear KVM switch, rebooted and everything is working great. The KVM switch is connected to both a Mac and a Dell WinXP system. The thumb button does not work on the Mac as expected. Love the way the mouse fits my hand. A two buttom mouse with scroll wheel is great with OSX. Hey Apple, its time to give up the one button mouse!"
5,Stylish,"Great mouse, looks good with my IBM T30. One promblem: mouseware software that comes with the product is not updated to Windows XP. I had to go to MicroInnovations web page to get updated drivers because IBM support did not even list the product."
3,Side button not ver Flexible,"This mouse is comfrtable and works well. The blue light in the scrollwheel is nice too. But the side button can not be assigned the proper hotkeys to to do a ""back"". The proper hotkeys are [alt][left arrow]. While the ""Page Back"" setting works just fine for Internet Explorer, it will not work for Windows Explorer or other products where [alt][left arrow] translates to ""back"".I don't know if this a shortcoming of the hardware, or of the bundled MouseSuite software, but it is really annoying."
5,People need to learn that optical mice work differently,"Just got this mouse for my Mom and she loves it. She has a lot of write and hand paint but still needs to use a mouse. The ergonomic shape was just what the doctor ordered for her. The performance is great as well. I bought her a mouse pad that is optimized for optical mice and she couldn't be happier.What a lot of people in reviews for optical mice don't understand is that optical technology is different than the wheel ball they're used to. You cannot always use your old mouse pad with an optical mouse, because the optical sensor may have a hard time reading the surface of your old mouse pad. Get a Ratzpad or other mousepad with repeating geometric shapes to maximize performance of your optical mouse."
4,button on side of mouse,"I agree with all of the positive reviews posted with one addition. One reviewer said that the button on the side of his mouse did not work (with a Mac) but that he didn't mind because he felt he would never use the button anyway. Let me tell you that I felt the same way about that button when I installed my mouse and in fact after I first installed the mouse I was accidentally clicking that side button all of the time - with frustrating results. However, once I became accustomed to the convenience of using that button as a back button - I can barely imagine living without it. I use that button ALL THE TIME, when surfing the web and also when navigating directories in Windows Explorer. Now whenever I use a mouse that doesn't have that extra side button, I find myself squeezing the side of the lesser mouse trying to find that button - much the same way as I often ""rub"" the spot between the two top buttons of an old fashioned mouse that doesn't have a scroll wheel."
5,A Beauty in the World of Mice.,"I bought this mouse for cheap, at $19.97 from a retail store. My initial thought was, ""Why so cheap? There has to be something wrong with it."" I was wrong. This is a beautifully crafted mouse, both visually and functionally. Works great. Although it only scans at 1500 frames, while other newer mice scan at 6000 frames, you can't tell the difference. Its just numbers. I play games as well as use it for Design and Multimedia creation. And it works fine. The blue scroll-light, as well as the perfect color of the body, sold me right away. I was willing to take the chance at such a good price.Evidently, there was no ""chance"" to be taken, because it works wonderfully! Why IBM discontinued production of the mouse, we will never know. IBM should have had Logitech and Microsoft running for cover! If you have a silver-, black- or grey-colored case and/or keybooard, buy this mouse now!! Note: Works best with a mousepad due to surface-consistency."
2,Having Problems with V1.72M install (XP driver SW),"I have read all the reviews and hope that when I succeed in installing the driver software my experience will be a positive one.I run XP on a Sony Vaio and when I went to install v1.72M of the driver software (downloaded from the Micro Innovations web site) I got the message that the software had not passed windows Logo testing and MS warned me to go no further. In view of the guy on this site who warned about crashing mice, I have gone no further. Mouse now in box, sour expression on face, and I am getting better on the touchpad."
1,Terrible Drivers : Buy this mouse if you want to waste money,"Both this and a similar optical USB wheel mouse that IBM sells are great for smacking against the floor and not much else. I smashed mine yesterday because I was so sick of having to plug it into my USB card 50 times before the computer would recognize the damn thing EVERY TIME I TURNED ON MY COMPUTER. At first, I thought maybe there was something wrong with my computer (Compaq Presario 2100z), but my friend bought a fricking IBM USB mouse for his Dell laptop and had the exact same problem. Only buy this mouse if find some masochistic pleasure in plugging and unplugging things millions of times and you want to expose your USB card to way more wear than it's made for."
3,Troubling,"This book is fascinating, yet troubling. I attribute what troubles me to the obvious bias of the author, and yet -- it certainly made me think. Not so much as to how much of what the author says is true (and the rest of what he speculates); but how I feel about such speculation seeing the light of day. At the same time, I am not an advocate of censorship in any way. Perhaps these thoughts need to be available in order to make us aware of how people can make the erroneous connections about the gay movement that they do. I think a book like this does more harm than good. Homosexuality does not equal man/boy love. This author would suggest that it does."
5,Childhood memories,"The song ""Insaf ki dagar pe"" reminds me of my childhood, since we have grown up listening to and singing along with this song. It really made me emotional!"
5,INDIA'S INDEPENDENCE!,August 15th is fast approaching and this album is great for celebrating India's independence. Both Shormona and Rajasree Mukherjee sing beautifully. The album evokes a sense of nostalgia for India especially for those people living abroad. I highly recommend getting this CD.
2,Not too Good,"Too much of a sweet flavor, wish I had gotten the peppered jerky. I hate this and so do most of the people at work."
4,"This ""Brides"" CD is ""on the one...""!","Just found out that this live CD was available... It's fantastic, hearing the Brides of Funkenstein again, after all this time! ""Ride On"", ""Together"", and ""Disco to Go"" are standouts. Get this CD!"
1,"5 stars for the film, 1 star for the Blu-ray","The recent Lions Gate release is terrible. Bare bones, muddy transfer, and missing subtitles that were present on the original Artisan DVD - subtitles which are essential to the story, I might add. I was appalled. I'm sending it back this week. I cannot wait for Criterion to give us a proper release of this classic film. I would encourage all fans of the film to stay away from this Lions Gate release."
5,"If you don't play another DVD this year, play The Piano","If the story and the music aren't enough to entertain you, and they should be, the photography of the landscape will. Outstanding movie, and the academy award the little girl won for it was well deserved."
5,Truly gripping,"Holly is absolutely wonderful in this story of love, sex and power. She is headstrong and knows what she wants...her piano, her music. She pays a price. I recommend this movie!"
1,A bad dream.....,"First of all,I saw this movie recently again (albeit, grudgingly) and still did not like the subject of the film, but I do have to say that the acting was excellent and I give Jane Campion credit for presenting this story on screen in a unique and stylized way. That said, all bets are off from that point on.I don't understand how Holly Hunter's character could adore such a man who is using a piano (the only thing she initially loves and adores) to bribe her for sex. What exactly is the attraction? I guess in that time and environment that is the ONLY man that treats her better than her husband. It's nice to know that times have progressed.The story is very sadistic and not the least bit romantic as was attested to by some of my female friends. AND, the setting in the New Zealand rainforest is dreary, gray, sticky and just unpleasant.Not likely to view this movie a third time, ever!"
2,"Beautifully made, but feminist drivel","I enjoyed Campion's effective imagery, which was often striking, and the performances, but the central theme of this film - A Woman Finding Her Voice In The Male Dominated Society - is nothing but Oprah-style feminist psychobabble.Enjoy the imagery, but take the message with a grain of salt."
1,Highly Overrated At Best.,"This movie made me nauseous. It was career death for Holly Hunter. Has anyone seen her lately? She seemed truly embarrassed after this movie came out. She can be a terrific actress as she was in 'Raising Arizona', but why she starred in this piece of trash, I will never know. Don't bother seeing this one. It is on my list of the ten worst movies ever."
2,"2 1/2 hours of wondering ""What's the point?""","Beautiful, pretentious movie featuring characters you can't relate to in any way. Why should we care about them? They're cartoons borne of a melodramatic imagination.Full frontal nudity of Harvey Keitel proves that not everything that is disturbing is art."
5,"Very Close To A Porn, But Great Filmaking","The Movie Is Great, The Acting Is Great But This Movie Could Be Almost Called A Porn. Its Explicit, Lusty All Of The Above. All iN All It's Not For People Who Thinks Censorship Is A Good Idea. But If You Need A Good Heartfelt Story...This Is It."
1,A gorgeous film that should never have been made--avoid!,"Jane Campion's film, although lushly beautiful and with stellar performances from all the main characters, particularly Neill and Hunter, left me sickened and angry. Hunter's character begins as a fiercely independent and unconventional woman; throughout the movie she is degraded and brutalized in attempts to make her 'normal', and exploited shamelessly by her aspiring lover Keitel. Also, be warned, there are scenes of graphic violence."
5,This is an excellent movie.,"The Piano is a profound, intelligent, and stunning film. It is a must-see for devoted musicians or anyone with a passion for life. The score by Michael Nyman helps make The Piano sound as good as it looks. Outstanding performances by a precocious Anna Paquin and an intriguing Holly Hunter. This is the kind of movie that will leave you pensive, emotional, and inspired. One of my favorites. END"
5,Worth Watching For Anyone With A Heart,Watched Movie years ago and couldn't get it out of my mind. Had to find it and buy it!
2,Sloppily done...,"The stars and the title of this review refers to the technical side of the DVD, and NOT of the movie itself (you can read about it in other reviews here). If you want to buy this DVD, note that the DVD is very poorly organized: There is no subtitle whatsoever, and the close-caption is extremely crudely made; there's only one audio track (English); there's no in-movie control, and if you go back to the root menu for some reasons, when resumed, the movie will switch to the other viewing angle (from widescreen to fullscreen, or via versa) by itself! Best to rent it, and buy the soundtrack instead."
2,Music the only good thing here!,"The movie was unbearably pretensious and put me to sleep after half an hour. Why any woman could choose sleazy Harvey Keitel over Sam Neill makes this movie wholly unbelievable, as well as Keitel's portrayal of a Maori! Very silly movie and would probably be featured on a new future edition of MST2K in 50 years. This movie's only saving grace is the wonderful soundtrack which is a good buy, but this video is a total waste of time, unless you need a bedtime lullaby."
2,Snoozefest!,"I heard all these great things about this movie so I rented it. I was bored till about a few minutes from the end, thats where all the action is. This Drama is not a winning one in my book. Pass on it."
2,bad,"If you like contrived, pretentious, artsy sophomoric junk, then you'll like this. I didn't. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is Anna Paquin is great."
1,Artsy softcore,"Having a contrived scripted, some lovely footage of coastal New Zealand, and impressive performance or two, does not negate the fact that this movie is little more than glorified ""artsy"" softcore. Having Harvey Kietel walk around naked (uggh!) may seem like an argument against such a theory, but the film's intellectual superior attitude proves it in the long haul."
2,A Major Disappointment,"This movie chronicles a somewhat trite story, surrounding an adulturous relationship. It does, however have a few redeeming qualities, such as the beautiful music and very beautiful scenery, for the setting. Unfortunately, I don't feel inclined to recommend the purchase of this DVD, since it lacks substance..."
1,"Could've been, Would've been, Should've been.....","The Piano was a film with good intentions gone wrong. Even at the height of the movie's plot, there was a certain mood that was lacking. There was the absence of any real depth. The sad thing is that you could feel them trying. The idea itself is beautiful. Heartbreakingly so. Yet somehow, through actions and words, the movie loses the grip on the strings that are secured to the heart. It was disappointing altogether, with an ending that matched the rest of the movie perfectly, it was lacking."
1,A real stinker,"Could easily be the most overrated video of all time. A hateful, cynical mess. The only redeeming quality was the outstanding cinematography."
2,"Great movie, poor DVD transfer","This is an excellent, haunting film, but unfortunately the DVD transfer is poor; there is a lot of black in the movie, and just about all of it exhibits MPEG artifacts to a distracting extent."
2,Totally overrated,"When this film was released, all the guys I knew kept mentioning how wonderful it was. So I went to see it, but was unimpressed. When I mentioned this, most of them admitted they hadn't really enjoyed it either, but that they always told women they thought it was great, because ""women love that movie."" Well, this one didn't.I should mention that I did love Jane Campion's ""An Angel at My Table"". And it's clear that a lot of effort went into making ""The Piano"". It's too bad, since the results aren't enlightening or uplifting. In fact, there doesn't seem to be much of a point; it's just sort of gratuitously sordid. (The ""Keitel-without-pants"" scenes don't help. That's a little more of him than I needed to see.)Check it out if you're curious, but don't feel bad if you don't like it. Despite the hype, you're not the only one."
2,A depressing movie,"The beginning of the movie is touching and poetic--piano is the way for Ada to express her feelings. But the poetic feeling is ruined in the end for Ada's passion for piano seems lessoned or replaced by the earthly love. As a musician, I wouldn't know how to survive if I couldn't play the instrument as I wish any more. The writer for the movie intentionally made the story horrifying and brutal to the point of irritation. But Ada's daughtor, who possesses a special personality and living in her own mystical world, leaves me an unforgetable impression."
2,Boring :-(,"Well, I'm really a lover for really good movies and when I heard of The Piano being played on german TV I watched it. (In germany it is rated for the age 12 and above) But I really think that this movie is BORING! Where's the laughter or the fun?(or even the great feelings)The only great thing on this movie was Anna Paquin She's a really good actress and I hope to see her again in this good mood."
5,a question,"I have seen this film many times, and love it more with each viewing. I have a question, though, for those of you who have seen it on DVD: does the DVD include alternet endings? I am looking for the extended under-water scene at the end which seems to have been cut from the American VHS release."
5,The Finger,"Let's just say that when he cuts off her finger, the combination of the cinematography, the score, and the overall visual and emotional effect, is just the most beautiful, haunting, and mesmerizing scene I have ever seen (as is the rest of the film)."
4,a very intense creation that plays with your mood,The movie as a whole is very profoundly crafted. It creates a mood and stays on your mind much after the movie is over! A must see for those interested in getting a lasting experience!
4,Very good and very unusual,"I've always had a crush on Harvey and I do like a man who's not afraid to show off his best feature! I also liked Holly Hunter she is such a good actress. And Anna played the lying little brat to perfection. It was very different, a kind of art house mainstream movie. Try it you'll like it."
1,"Well, that was a waste of time....!","I guess I'll have to join the ranks of the ""great unwashed"" who just don't appreciate films like this. I read where Ada was suppose to be so complex-not speaking and playing the piano well makes a person complex? I didn't think she even gave her new husband a chance (plus, what husband (even nowadays) is going to haul a piano up a jungle mountainside...they're a pain to move from one room to another!). All in all, I found this movie to be annoying. I liked Anna Paquin-she was very good, but one little girl doesn't a great movie make!"
3,Not a Good Movie,"To me, this film was not very good. It didn't pass any feelings through me like most good movies. I would say that the story for this movie is sick and kind of stupid, and some of the actors (not to mention any names) did not do a good job playing in it. The movie did entertain me enough, though, to sit through the whole thing. I totally fell in love with the music. To me, just hearing the music in it was worth the long watch."
1,'The Piano' - it's overrated and sado-masochistic,"Forgive me for saying so, but 'The Piano' is nothing but a disgusting movie. It's just unbelievable that so many hold it in such a high regard. I can only see it as a perfect lesson for a sado-masochistic wannabe? I saw it once many years ago and I will never do it again."
1,Chop! Chop!,"(What do Holly Hunter and Burt Reynolds have in common?)Just another flick about a gal who falls for an abuser, this time with the gimicks of a waterlogged piano and exotic New Zealand Maori.The tribe had it right, though, ignore these two losers and stick with the trees."
1,I smell a recall...,"I feel this is a great masterpiece of a film which is mistakenly missing the subtitles, so if you can't interpret the main character's sign language or if you don't speak the tongue of the New Zealand natives then you're going to have a problem with this Lion's Gate release. A few other reviews posted here are calling the blu-ray release inferior due to picture quality issues which I don't understand one bit. Sure, there are some low-lit scenes which appear grainy but that is simply the nature of celluloid. Even the master print will show that.Point is, I wish I could return this copy in exchange for a corrected version. Is someone at Lion's Gate Studio listening...or do they even care to fix the problem? I'm going to try returning my copy for a refund."
2,Disappointing Debut On Blu-ray,"So far, this Australian Blu-ray is the only way to get Jane Campion's lovely film in high definition.The upside is that it looks better than the non-anamorphic region 1 dvd from Artisan.The downside is that it's a 1080i transfer AND sourced from a PAL master so it suffers from 4% speed-up which is very noticeable in Holly Hunter's voice and ruins the gorgeous Michael Nyman score that I know by heart.It is also worth nothing that even though the disc is coded for Region A, B, and C that it does not play in my US-based Playstation 3. I could only get it to play in my multi-region Sherwood Blu-ray player.So, if you're looking for a US-friendly solution to see ""The Piano"" in HD, this isn't it."
2,lion's gate blu ray,"Like the previous blu ray from AU a few years ago, this one too omits the essential subtitles from Ada's sign language to her daughter about her relationship and the Maori's dialogue. It makes no sense that they missed these important parts of the film.Unlike other criticisms, though, I think the print is actually very good. Some of it is grainy, but this was filmed with many dark scenes and in the jungle, and I don't recall it being much different in the movie theater. The color is great and the sound is great."
5,Brilliant,"I love The Piano. The story is excellent and intriguing and the actors bring out the characters beautifully. Holly Hunter, who won an Oscar for this role, does very well in a role that requires no lines. She acts with her face and with her body and the her silence transcends the normal realm of communication. Harvey Keitel, whom I understand is usually the uber macho-man, struck the perfect balance between his macho masculinity and the true depths of George Baines. I'm very disappointed he didn't win the Oscar for this role because I think he does a wonderful job in this film. Jane Campion's directing is beautiful and the whole film reflects that."
2,Disappointing,"I loved Holly Hunter in ""Saving Grace"", so I went searching for movies in which she starred. This slow-moving, depressing movie is one I wish could un-see. Save your money and buy the ""Saving Grace"" collection."
2,Artistic no,I rented this movie thinking it would be very good and interesting to a point but I found the nudity and explict sex sceens disguisting. The sex sceens and nudity I found pointless for this film. I understand it was part of the story but it could have been less more to a PG-13 rating. Harvey Kitel's frontal nudity sceen was horrible and gross. (...)
1,The Depths,"This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, female director or not. It features a mute who cannot figure out how to deal with an arranged marriage mate who is insensitive to her needs and another tattooed man who lusts for her, though quietly. She chooses the latter after the former does violence upon her hand -- with which she played the piano.This film shows what humanity is capable of sinking to, and then perhaps rising from slightly. But who cares!Some reviews say it is beautiful. It is not! People in period dress slipping around in the mud of some jungle. Inconsistant jungle cum hilltop jumps make the whole muddy thing seem low budget, and low concept. Try another film by a different director."
1,A dumb film about a dumb woman,"The heroine of this film has to be high on the list of most irritating characters I have ever encountered. She doesn't speak, though it is never explained why, my own guess is that she just likes driving everyone crazy. She allows herself to be married off to a man in New Zealand who she evidnetly doesn't like, again we are never told why. Her husband won't let her take her beloved piano into their home, why on earth not? Playing the piano was an essential female accomplishment in those days, every middle-class household had a piano. What kind of a woman uses her own daughter as a go-between between herself and her lover? Apart from being a thoroughly immoral thing to do, it is also extremely stupid. Everyone knows no child can keep a secret. I think her husband shows reamrkable forebearance in only cutting her finger off, personally I think he'd have done better to cut her head off."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Watched this for the first time a few weeks ago as I am a huge Sam Neill fan. I couldn't believe how abhorrent this movie was. Even the next day I asked myself several times why the heck I just didn't turn the terrible thing off. The characters are static and dull. There is way too much naked Harvey Keitel and Anna Paquin is just as mind numbing to watch as a child as she is today, if not more so. Do not watch this piece of garbage, its a waste of time. I wish I had the 2 1/2 hours of my life back....and I am still wondering how it managed Academy Award status."
2,Who wants to see Harvey's p _n_ s?,"If your answer is yes, then the Piano is your movie. Too bad we only have stars to choose from, I would have definitely given this one two spheres if I could have. It's not a bad movie if you like to watch a mute and see a man who should not be revealing himself reveal himself. I leave it to you, but be warned curiosity killed the cat and damn near took me.Be Careful.Archibald Lasalles"
5,"Is There A Writen Version, Book?",I loved the movie. And would Love to find out who wrote it and if the book has or will be published. If anyone has any info it would be greatly appreciated.
