3,Careful on mounting surface thickness.,"Got this for relatives for baby gift. Well built and sturdy, but thickness of their breakfast bar leads to using the build in screw adjusters to crank the arms down flat - bending the frame but not damaging it so far. More than ~2 inches thickness and you really have to crank on the thing - I'm guessing it will eventually fail catastrophically - obviously not good when the kid is in it. Seat does hold onto mess like yoghurt, but is easily washable. I consider this type of seat for picnics and occasional type use - prefer hard materials for everyday for ease of cleanup."
3,easy hook on chair,I loved this chair untill a 6 year old I babysit broke it. he was able to pull off one of the knobs on the arm off making it to unstable for my baby to sit it. other than it being broken I really liked this seat for my daughter and would get it again.
1,Not a good investment,"I bought this chair after much consideration and research. Even though many - or it seemed like most - of the reviews were very favorable, I found the chair flawed for the following reasons:1. Security Risk: The straps do not tighten enough to keep a restless child secure in the seat. My daughter got out of it easily simply by standing up. Had we taken our eyes off her for even a second, she might have fallen onto the floor.2. Mess Factor: There is a huge gap - four inches or so - between the seat and the table, allowing food to fall onto the floor very easily.This seat is however the only one on the market that fits tables with a wide skirt - which is partly why I bought it. So if you must have one that fits a table with a wide skirt, this might be your only choice. You would have to watch your child very, very carefully.I am returning the seat."
2,Good luck finding a table this will work on,"You're going to need a table with absolutely no protrusions on the bottom to get this to attach to a table. Our dining room table didn't work. The table in a condo in Hawaii didn't work.It's heavy.It's awkward to assemble (which you need to do each time you take it out if its carrying case).But it is well constructed, and if it works on your table and you don't plan to travel with it, I think it's a decent chair."
5,Great chair. Love It!!!,We have the hippo one. It has been used on and off for 5 yrs with 2 children. And it still looks brand new. I just leave it on the kitchen table and only move it to clean it. Over time i have learned to clean it. Most of the time just wipe it down...but when it ready for a good cleaning....don't go though all the trouble of taking the cover off the frame....it can take awhile. I just rinse the chair in the sink: frame and all. Hang it out side for a few hours and its dry. Great sturdy chair. It is meant to last. I never used it for travel but i think it would be great too. It is not too bulky.
2,Difficult to clean,"It is easy to put together and attach to the table. It is sturdy and relatively light/portable.But I have 2 complaints: 1. the front and side of the chair is fabric, so it gets dirty very fast and cannot be wiped. If these parts were vinyl-like material, it would be much easier. 2. The back of the chair could have more padding."
5,Good space saving highchair!,"I bought this for my son although he is now 2 1/2 to keep him contained while trying to get him to eat dinner :) Well he ended up figuring out how to undo the straps just like everything else we have! This isnt the highchairs fault so I still give it 5 stars. Its very sturdy, hooks onto the table perfectly. My son is 30 lbs and hasnt damaged it at all b/c of his weight. My daughter who is a baby will also sit in it from time to time but she uses a different highchair at the moment b/c of the seat recline. We love both of our highchairs (also have the fisher price rainforest deluxe) so this one will be kept at grandma and grandpa's house soon since my son has already outgrown this! Its great for grandparents as they can put it away easily once baby is no longer around and wont have a large highchair taking up space in their house. We are very happy with our purchase :)"
1,Horrible Mess,"This chair is impossible to keep clean. It says to spot clean, which is impossible, so I went ahead and washed it on my gentle cycle which was fine, except you have to take the whole thing apart and it just gets filthy the very next time you use it. I was embarrassed to even let people see it in my house. As others mentioned, there is also a gap between the chair and the table where everything falls on the floor. It also won't fit on an island. I am selling this and looking for another, easier option."
5,Looooooove it!,"I've had this chair for about a week so far, and I have no complaints. I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers that it is difficult to clean. I think it is a breeze to wipe down. It is sturdy and securely fits to the table. It was easy to assemble (took about 5 minutes or less) and even easier to attach to the table. We have a table skirt and it fits just fine. The only thing that the consumer should know is that if your table has a center leaf that folds down and stores under the table the chair won't attach unless the leaf is up and your table is at full size because the leaf gets in the way of the bottom supports."
2,Breaks easily,"We loved the idea of this chair... Easy to transport, doesn't take up floor space. But after using it just two months it stopped latching properly to the table for no reason. It no longer tightens properly so it isn't safe for my child anymore. I am dissapointed."
2,Doesn't fit,"I ordered this because of the good reviews, but it doesn't work for us. First it took almost 2 weeks to arrive, which has nothing to do with the product but was especially frustrating since I'm now returning it. It doesn't fit our island or dining room table. The arms are really long, requiring a pretty deep space. It's also much more cumbersome than expected. I thought we'd just fold it up and take it out to dinner with us, but it doesn't collapse very small. We didn't use it to actually feed the baby since it didn't work in our kitchen, but I could tell the space between the counter and the baby was too wide and we would end up with more food on the floor than anywhere else.It does seem like a solid design, so if it works in your kitchen then it's probably a good purchase."
2,harness problem,"we loved this until our daughter started standing up in it. wish it had a 5-point safety harness-with the straps going over the shoulders, but doesn't. No matter how tight you make the straps, the kiddo will come out of it. we are looking into the Rigalo one."
4,"Very good, could be better",Very strong and reliable seat. It's been used on different tables with all sizes of skirts and there's always a safe grip. The main problem is the lack of a carrying bag and the not so compact size em it's closed and not dissasembled.I sure recommed it.
3,Too hard to clean,"This chair is a great idea... in theory. However, it's way too complicated to clean (you have to take it apart and machine wash the fabric part), and it gets filthy after about 2 uses. This means you'd need to wash it approximately every day! I'm not a germ-o-phobe, but for anyone who is, you will definitely not like it! Contrary to the description, this fabric is not easy to just wipe clean!My other complaint is that it definitely doesn't work with all tables. We have a fairly standard kitchen table, and it almost didn't work for us. We can only hook it onto the ends of our table, not the sides, due to supports under the table that are too large to get the chair around.What would make it better: If the seat were truly made of some easy-to-wipe-clean fabric OR if Chicco made a good cover for it that could be removed and wiped clean. Having to take it apart constantly to wash it is definitely not acceptable. Please, Chicco, make a cover!"
4,Great for Travel not for Everyday,"We love this Chicco Caddy high chair. It stays in my trunk always and thanks to it's lay flat ability it doesn't prevent me from loading things onto of it. Admittedly sometimes getting the little buttons to rotate the arms into the flat position is a little trying, but with it's irregular use for our family it's not a show stopper. It latches onto tables easily and more importantly only takes a few seconds to set up and take down. We prefer to bring this high chair into restaurants because we know where it's been and the state of cleanliness. Speaking of cleaning I saw some parents have problems with this feature. We haven't had any issue it's easily to flip inside out and shake out crumbs and when more resisting food gets on it fits in the kitchen sink to be scrubbed out and then latches to the kitchen table to dry. I would recommend this to any mom or mom to be."
2,"great for outings, not at home",Did not fit on either of our two dining tables at home. Needs a large flat area under the table for the bars to fit. Measure first before purchasing!
5,Wonderful!,"Saw this product reviewed on YouTube and got one for my then 8 month old. We were having trouble with her standing up in high chairs, but not with this one! She has room to kick and seems much happier being a part of everything. We get so many complements and are always recommending it! Was a wonderful buy worth every penny!!!"
4,Just what a small dinning area needs,"Many years ago we had a similar product for our boys which we loved. I liked it a little better than this one because our children weren't able to climb out of it. We purchased this for our grand daughter and it's really great when she wants to be fed, however, when she wants to get out she can easily do so. This could be dangerous if you turned your back for a minute. She is only 9 months old and it doesn't seem to matter how tight we make the straps. So for feeding it's great, but not as secure as an ordinary high chair or even the one that we had purchased in the past."
3,"Not amazing, but still convenient","It works well and is easy to put on the table most of the time.Not so great at restaurants (in the case of all high chairs being taken) because if the table is small, there may be a tipping situation. Or a child who realizes he can rock the whole table...no fun either.My biggest complaint is how easily the thing unfolds and clicks into place when I DON'T want it to. It lives in the trunk of my SUV and if I move it the tiniest bit, it opens and locks open. So I have to go fumbling for the little buttons to collapse it again unless I want it taking up space.Wish Chicco could've either added some velcro on somewhere to prevent it from flipping open unexpectedly, or maybe had a carrying case you could buy with it (for an additional $10-15, I would sign on for it not opening and driving me nuts at least once a week).On the bright side, it's wonderfully convenient and light and fits with almost any table out there."
2,Not my favorite product,"I thought the idea of this was great...a portable high chair that would fit on nearly any table in restaurants, at the in-laws....Well, the first time we used it at the in-laws, the leg wouldn't release from under the table...we thought we were going to have to saw the table apart to get the chair out from under it! We returned that particular unit, and the replacement one still has a leg that is sticky.The other issue with this chair is that if a restaurant table is lighter, your baby will tip the table. Also, tables with any wood underneath such as a leaf or an extension will not permit this chair.If you are looking for something portable, I would purchase one of those space-saving high chairs and cart that to other people's houses. It is easier and more reliable.We rarely use this Chicco product. We end up toting the space-saving high chair instead"
2,Wish it were machine washable,"The fabric gets filthy with each feeding and requires a lot of scrubbing. It would be great if you could easily remove it (it's not very easy) and throw it in the washing machine (hand wash only). We're switching to a plastic seat with removable tray that can be wiped down more easily.Other than that, it's sturdy, and functions well for us. It also folds flat and fits in a large suit case for our cross-country visits."
4,Great alternative to a highchair,"We bought this having seen another couple with their baby using it at a restaurant and figured we would leave it in our car for the same purpose. But once we tested our 6 month old daughter in it attached to our kitchen island at home we realized we don't want a regular high-chair and might get another one for eating out. This is much less bulky than a normal high-chair and I am happy to have one less brightly colored plastic thing in our grown-up area! It's attached at the corner end of our island so that I can sit almost opposite her in one of our bar stools to feed her. When she can feed herself at our regular mealtimes, we'll move the chair to our dining table so she can interact with us. The only downside is that it shows dirt (dried food) more than a wood or plastic chair that can be wiped down. The fabric needs more of a scrubbing or to be thrown in the laundry to really get all the food off."
1,Child sits too far from counter,"I bought this chair so that my daughter could sit at the island counter with her two older brothers. The counter has a 12"" overhang from the base of the island and when the chair is installed, there is about a 3"" gap between the chair and the counter. It makes feeding the dog even easier for our daughter but is not what I consider a feature. Other options appear to have a more compact design to attach the chair so I'm going to buy a second. Maybe I can sell the one I have on ebay so I get a little back- at least I had a coupon when I bought it."
4,Great Purchase,I don't have much time as my little boy is a calling but I did want to take a moment to write how wonderful this item has been for us. The Chico chair is now apart of our daily routine and our little boy feels comfortable and safe in it. Thank you for a great product.
3,OK Chair,We really liked this chair but a few problems arose. 1st - it was difficult to take off the pad to wash. 2cnd - one side suddenly didnt tighten enough to really fit to the table. We don't use it anymore because I don't feel its secure. I like the design for the most part and we did use it alot.
3,Should it be this time consuming to clean?,"It hooks onto the counter just fine - it works! However, I like my things to be tidy and spotless after each meal. This is a nightmare to clean after each meal. Sure it washes in the washer just fine but the food gets stuck on the velcro and in all the cracks, on the straps, etc. It is not easy to clean and forget about the extra padding that comes with it...now you're looking at double clean up. It is a pain!!!"
4,Works great but hard to clean,"The price is great for this and we absolutely love it. The only thing is it is hard to clean, the cover does not come apart from the chair. Other than that its great!"
1,Disappointed,"Disappointing product from Chicco. The supports are difficult to secure, canvas does not wipe clean, requiring disassembly and washing after every use, and the safety buckle was incredibly hard to open. I returned this item."
5,Perfect for camping and home use,"I love this little chair for seating my toddler at the table. It keeps her in place, it doesn't take up a lot of room, and it packs down nice and small for hauling to the campgrounds with us. I haven't run into a situation yet where I couldn't find a way to make it work ... with some picnic tables you just have to be a little inventive. It washes up great too! Well worth the money spent on it."
1,"Too hard to clean, wouldn't recommend","We have a small place and 9 mo twins to boot, so space is at a premium. We were so excited to get these, thinking they'd save space and bring the babies right to us at the table. We started using them at 7 mo, and only 2 months later, we've replaced them with old fashioned high chairs. The problem is that they are IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP CLEAN. They get coated with food at every feeding- the babies spit their food, touch the chairs with food-coated hands and even chew on the sides of the chair. We'd try to wipe them down after every meal, but the porous material traps the food and you have to hand wash them constantly. You'd think you could get the material on and off easily, but you have to disassemble the whole thing to get the fabric off and it takes time. I wish we never got these, wasted time and money, and lots of frustration."
5,Amazing Remedy for Herpes Zoster in the Mouth!,"I have an auto immune disorder which includes constant outbreaks of Herpes Zoster in my mouth, (chicken pox virus). I was just about at my wits end when I found this mouthwash and toothpaste! It is really working to rid my poor mouth of the sores! Hurray!"
2,It was selling for $9.99 in Circuit City,"It was selling for $9.99 in Circuit City. But passed it up, prefer to rent first."
3,whatever,"i personally liked it, i dont care what these other folks say. im not them. who cares if its not a blockbuster, its entertainment to me, just like dogfights are to others, just with less actual cruelty."
3,This movie could of been one of the best!!,"Wow, this movie was just WOW!! IF only they had a budget and a better camera looks like it was shot on a Hi8 camcorder. Grainy and the lighting just sucked. Plot twist and just crazy insane things that would probably happen in real life captured to film. I could so see that some pervert out there would rape a zombie. He got his due though!! Not for the light hearted or squimish.. Very gruesome but for the gore enthusiast its a must watch."
2,I've seen worse,This wasn't that great. Poor lighting was it's biggest problem. But I have seen worse movies. For the dollar something plus shipping I'm not gonna complain too much. The best part of the movie in my opinion was the music. The main character was cool and reminds me of someone I'd probably hang out and drink beer with.
2,its pretty bad,"its actually pretty bad,its just way to boring,thiers really nothing specail about the movie whats so ever,only thing good about the movie was the trailer i saw on the internet,which was done very good,but the movie is just straight bad!only thing that looks good was the make-up job looks very good!i give it 2 stars for good gore,but the movie just aint worth the time"
2,not so good,The people stand around and talk. This could have been good but the script is very bad. And i'd be damned if the zombies are everywhere well hey lets crawl under this house and see whats going on.... sheeeesh the music was pretty good and if they had spoke how people speak.
1,Absolute Garbage...,Ok... So lets make and EXTREMELY crappy zombie movie with grandpa'sold movie camera and put a really cool picture on the DVD cover so it looks intriguing! Good lord folks...This is BAD! Quite rarely do I take a gamble and buy a movie that I have not heard about beforehand....and im POSITIVE It will never happen again. Even the 3.99 price tag on this DVD is far too costly as I am sure that I could find a decent drink coaster for cheaper.Anyone who likes this movie is either involved in its production or in a coma.
3,I'M HUNGRY !,"Romero's ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"" Fulci's ""ZOMBIE 2"" & Bob Clark's ""CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS"" are proof that money has little to do with cooking up a classic zombie film! William Victor Schotten's ""DEAD LIFE"" just prooves the point even further as it is obvious this film was made with alot less money than any of the classics i named above & still seems to have that destine for cult status quality to it. This is a perfect example of doing so much with so little! There are a few zombie firsts & you will see what i mean when you watch it & the end is great! Any real true zombie fan will likey!"
2,fuzzy wuzzy,"Okay I admit, they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends. Heres my problem, they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera, most of the scenes were blurry, every now and again the focus was clear, I mean c'mon, when I was fourteen I made a short stop motion animation film using an old Bell and Howell super 8 cam and even then I paid attention to the focusing.Okay enough of that, now for the pros of the film. The make-up fx were good and there is one scene that will make most MEN wince, the outdoor and some indoor settings had a NOTLD feel. Overall I recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds, at least you can say you saw it. Rent if you can, if not, buy used."
1,Ouch,"Let me start by saying that I love indipendent features and support them fully.A movie like this threatens my support.The actors ( I use that term loosly ) are just dreadful and don`t have any emotion. The "" dreadful sex scene "" is only dreadful in the fact that they wasted good film to shoot it. The SFX are passable and the story is just a retread. Do not waste your time with this.I have to seriously question the reviewer that speaks so fondly for his love of zombie features. It reads exactly like the review that is quoted on the case.If you want to see how good indipendent features can be purchase Van Bebbers The Manson Family or the upcoming Actress Apocolpse."
1,Wow this one is bad,"I wanted to give this one a chance. And I like to see a young director and cast try to make something special without a lot of cash, but this just looks poor. The makeup for the zombies isn't too bad, until bad camera work shows the end of the makeup about an inch before the hair on the back of their heads. Looks really bad considering the makeup is a blue color, then you see white skin then hair. Thats just for beginners, the camera used for this film was a good idea(grainy 70's look), but please come up with better actors and record the sound better. You can't hear it unless you crank the volume. The people who gave this a good review on the box, should be in jail. I do not recommend this one, unless your last name is Bin Laden. One more thing, there is frontal nudity in this movie and its not the good kind, its a guy."
2,"film stock is low quality, however the movie is better.","The film itself is a decent little no budget zombie flick made by first timers.It even has a really terrible scene of a man raping a zombie who then bites off his offending member aka shlong. I can't fault them on any of this, it's the quality of the film or digital picture with it's terrible quality, it has blotches on it and defects and is very soft focus. If it had been shot on anything other than a hand camera probably it would have been a three star NO BUDGETER. It is the film that's the problem not the movie. BUt it's hard to get by the hand camera lack of clarity but as a little zombie flick the film is decent. THe makeup is very good too."
1,Warning - Avoid !!,"One never likes to really criticize a creative work because it is difficult to create a song, or movie or other creative object.On the other hand it is easy to be a critic.BUT sometimes something is so bad you feel obligated to warn people away.This movie deserves such a warning.It looks like the kind of movies we used to make with our home 8mm film cameras in the 70s just for fun.Terrible film qualityBad lightingBad soundBad scriptBad actingIt is like a group of friends got together one day with no advance planning and said ""lets just improvise on the spot and make a movie today. We will make it up as we go along"".Horrible in all aspects."
1,"These are the worst quality envelopes I have ever purchased, avoid them.","I don't know how I ended up being sent complete junk. I even went to my previous orders to buy the exact same thing to make sure I got the same quality I have purchased in the past. The mailers I received were so thin I didn't expect my item to make it safely to the post office let alone across the country. The flap tore on one as I was putting an item in it (a small lightweight item). The seal is very thin as opposed to the nice wide seal I have seen on my previous orders. I don't know if the seller is trying to save money by sending an inferior item or what, but I will not be purchasing this item from the same seller again (Value Mailers). I was very disappointed and don't think the mailers are even worth using."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"I was sorta surprised when I received the poly mailers in the mail today. After looking them over (this is the first time I've bought this product) I was thoroughly disappointed. As another reviewer said, these are extremely thin (about as thick as a ziploc bag, with probably about the same protection)and are extremely flimsy. I generally use bubble mailers, and in comparison this product is CRAP. The only upside is that it ""seems"" (using that word very loosely) like they are waterproof...I guess I get what I pay for out of this product, having only spent about $10 for 100 mailers. I won't be buying these mailers again."
2,Poly Mailer Envelopes 9 x 12,I had a different expectation than what I received but I think my visual of this product was incorrect and I just will not purchase them again.
3,"They do the job, but are thin","These bags are MUCH thinner than the bags I used to receive from this seller...though it's the same ad. Im not sure the quality of other sellers bags. i bought from Amamax. They do tear fairly easily, so be sure to use extra tape and they should be fine."
2,Bags,BAGS ARE BELOW STANDARD. WHEN YOU ENTER LIGHT WEIGHT ITEM THEY FALL APART AT SEAMS. I WOULD NOT ORDER AGAIN.
5,"Great, A++++++","nice quality supplies, A++++++, will shop again!!!scale works perfectly.6*9 bags are a little too small, but i chose the size so no complain!"
1,Really BAD Envelopes,"I tried to mail a t-shirt to a friend in one of these bags. the bag ripped badly enough that an empty bag was delivered. also, writing directly on the bag doesn't work - it smears regardless of the type of pen/marker used. i now have 99 more useless envelopes!"
4,Good for mailing light and small stuff.,"I purchased these envelopes for the company envelopes events shipping. Everyone got the shipment safely with no damage. The material is ok and over the average although not the best, but it has good price. Might purchase it again when need it!"
2,Not the greatest quality ...,"I remember these being a better quality. They're a great price but the description is not very accurate. These are very difficult to use for shipping. The bags are stuck together inside so you have to work your hand into the bag to separate the sides before you can slip your item inside and the sides don't separate very easily so the bag looks all worked over by the time you have it ready to place your item inside.The sticky strip is great ... once it's sealed, it's not going to come unglued! But I've had a few bags tear just from when I was removing the strip from the adhesive. The bags are pretty thin! Though I would trust them with a light weight item for domestic shipping, I would not trust them if I had a heavy item to ship, nor would I use them for my international shipping. I don't know if they would withstand the wear very well."
3,Needs better quality control,"They need better quality control. Of the 100 envelope bags I ordered, I lost 6 due to the fact that the protective plastic strip covering the extremely strong adhesive was skewed so that several of the bags arrived permanently glued to one another."
5,Perfect!,"I love the family of these envelopes. They are so sturdy, flexible, light, convenient and pleasant to use, The adhesive is perfect! I very much enjoy using them, and all my packages look so stylish and professional!"
2,Rosle disappoints,"Handsome indeed. And feels great in the hand. However, I ended up returning this because the blade is serrated. Result is, of course, grooves in each slice of cheese. May not bother some people but, at that price, it's bothersome to me."
4,"good cheese plane, but a little pricey","the cheese plane works well, cuts nice thin even slices. takes pressure well. high quality construction. looks nice and modern. I throw it into the dishwasher with no issues. my biggest complain is really to do with the price... $30+ for this product is really pricy, when you consider the relative cost of say microplanes etc."
5,LOVE IT,this is such a pretty doll. she has such a pretty dress that sparkles so much. but one of the problems is her hair is not even so it looks kind of bad. but other wise this doll is worth the money. I play with my sister all the time. also for parents if you give your daughter this doll she will really want the prince.
2,Doesn't hold water,"The water does pump, but it doesn't go very far out. Not much fun for little boys who love big splashes. You have to pump really hard to get water to move and a lot of it runs right back out the bottom. It hasn't broken yet, but then again, they don't play with it much because it doesn't work very well. We were all disappointed."
1,Not great,"Not much to say except the pump does not work, alas. Not for me, age 34, and not for my son, age 4."
3,Good book when you don't want to think,Book was okay but pretty well knew the outcome before the first chapter. Good for a brainless read when you just want to escape and relax.
3,NOT TO BAD,"FRONT THE BACK COVER:Tom has loved jessica since high school. And sixteen years later he still does. But Jess sees Tom as her best friend- a chum. Tom is certain she'll never view him as anything else, and he's too afraid of possibly ruining their friendship to tell her how he really feels.As a successful chef in Manhattan, Jessica Stewart has reached her professional goals-but her biological clock is ticking. In need of a husband, Jessica decides an online dating service is the answer. Since Tom knows her better than anyone else does, she seeks his help in completing the questionnaire.Can Jessica learn to trust God - instead of the Internet - for love? Can Tom fulfill his promise to Jessica's father to protect her, even if she's determined to find love online?I didn't catch that this was a Inspirational Romance, something I never buy. Althought the writing was good, this is not the type of book I'll buy again."
3,Good price,"Was a good price, the book is in good shape, although has some pages written with pen ...price was better than college."
2,Not good!,"I'm not really happy with this books. It's just acceptable. In fact, the seller should delete all answer. There are too much hint or words in this book, and I'm not feel happy."
1,We never received this book,"I have not received this order yet. Please contact meI had to buy this book at MDC Bookstore. If you are asking why I did not contact you before, it was because I did not find how to do it. Please Now I need my money back. Thank you very much."
2,it took forever to get here.,it took almost a week to get here and it have a lot of hand writting i mean i know i bought a used book but it have a lot more than expected hand writting on it.
3,old book still can use,"Old book, no torn, no stain but it's crinkle at the last couple pages. still can use it."
2,Inconsistency,"This is made in China, not Germany. It is an exuberant amount to pay for a product that did not cost much to make."
5,Louis L'Amour,"Louis L'Amour, what else do you need to know. His western novels are all excellent. If you have not read L'Amour you are missing a lot of fun."
3,Passin' Through,"It was ok. Ill have to read it several more times and maybe it will improve. I have read almost ALL Louis L,Amour books. Most of them I have in hard Back first additions. This particular one is kind of slow in the middle, and really didnt end that well either."
5,Enjoyable read,Really enjoyed this read. Just Passin as he became known as experiences about all the problems he could have on the trail. Nothing seemed to go well for long and he was once again in a recovery state. Kept me interested and had a good ending.
2,Really?,"An entire book to say....Don't commit your life to training, but don't be lazy.Perform ""breakthrough"" (difficult) training seesions once or twice a week, the rest is filler.Sometimes less is more.That's it. Plenty of people think this book is revolutionary, but it did nothing for me."
2,"""Breakthrough""?","I agree with one of the previous reviewers who summed up the book -- the basic advice is to listen to your body, but other than that, it really doesn't offer that much. Worth reading if you're tired and plateauing (i.e., overtraining), but other than that, doesn't offer much."
1,"good idea, poor execution",The video quality is a bit grainy. The transformation effects seem to have been made with poor quality morphing software. The few transformation shots are short. The extra features are few. The ending is lame.
1,Porn....Plain and Simple,"Okay, I wanted to like this movie, but I admit it was very disappointing. While I have nothing against folks who want to watch pornographic films, I do have a problem with them masquerading as horror movies. Wolfhound is nothing more than soft core porn with some bondage thrown in to titillate the audience.As a fan of werewolf movies, I had hoped for more. When the couple found the set of chains and manacles in the neighbor's basement, I had to give this one up.Recommended? No."
1,Not worth the money,"This product was pricey for what you get. It is basically a Barbie type doll. The wings come off all the time because they are magnatized and when we received the product from the seller, both the little fairy and Bloom's wings did not light up. The seller said they did when they left the store. I have to go purchase special batteries in addition to the cost of the toy and repair it myself. I did not purchase the toy for its educational value, but I would not spend this kind of money again for this type of toy. Go get a Barbie Mariposa for $[...] at Target. Those wings stay on!"
5,Yet another great Schaum's outline book,"Much like the rest of the Outline series, this book is great. It covers pretty much all the important topics in pretty good detail. It starts off fairly gently but the problems (worked and otherwise) are good and challenging (for me at least). This book would be great companion to any undergraduate modern physics course."
2,"Now, I am sure i wouldn't buy this",It is a very basic reference and it don't explain nothing more. Her only you could find some sort of basic expresions but nothing more.
3,"Pretty Good, But Could Be Better","I am working through the book from beginning to end, so far I have found one mistake in a solved problem per chapter (the chapters are only a few pages long with roughly 10 to 12 questions for each section). I'm a big fan of Schaum's outlines, but this one seems to be lacking in good problems and careful editing. The answers are correct, they just have typos in the solved problems. I still like the book, but be ready to get frustrated once in a while when that isn't really a negative sign and you waste a bunch of time."
1,Made in CHINA,"I have not use the product.I give it a low rating only to increase awareness about this ""minor"" detail.Product is advertised as Made in Germany, yet on the product itself label says made in China. I can buy Made in China anywhere if I don't want to think about sweat shops and the workers there."
4,Best peeler I have ever bought,I am left handed and have a hard time buying kitchen utensils that work and I can hold comfortably. I have bought many peelers and this one is by the best one. Very sharp peels very quickly. I would have paid double. The only negative I would hae is you cannot really pick out yes of potatoes like other peelers.
5,amazing.,Archies final project was an amazing story.I would totaly recomend it to others.The plot was based on many teen's feelings or view of life.
2,"If Rated, This Would be NC-17.",CAUTION:This is NC-17 Equivalent. Uses the F-word continuously and has hard core porn in it. And all this was in the first 7 minutes - I stopped watching after that long.
2,"These ""chillers"" weren't released from the vault, they escaped!","BRAIN DAMAGE FILMS. Ever hear of 'em? I'm told this shoestring indie outfit used to be pretty good. Judging by this icky triple play, that assessment may be wildly exaggerated.So, do you want badly made gorefests? REALLY bad ones? I mean like: ""why am I watching this junk"" bad? If so, RAZOR's FEAR FILES is just what you've been looking for!Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll ratings.(2.3) Blood Sisters (2003) - Phoebe Dollar/Erica Howard/Kerry Liu(1.6) Evil Unleashed (2003) - Serena Morales/Heather Chase/Perrine Moore/Jelani Gibson(3.3) Bloody Tease (2004) - Steve Beaumont Jones/Dan Wells/Michael Sharp/Elma Madison"
3,Comment,Unfortunately the movie is in Chinese and without an English subtitle.So I cannot understand the story.
2,Does not fit,"I ordered this grille insert for my wife's 07 Equinox and it didn't COME CLOSE to fitting. The top piece was too tall and too narrow and the bottom piece had about 5 to 6 inches on each side that didn't cover the grille. Box said Putco 82150, exactly what I ordered, but it wasn't close to matching the description online. I gave this item 2 stars because the product was well cut and had a good mirror finish."
5,Works as fast as you do,"I use this flat whisk more than my regular one because it works quickly to fluff eggs, sauce, and other items. If you're making gravy in the skillet, this is the perfect tool. Rosle quality rocks."
4,Great for price,"The video quality is not that good since it keeps showing a line in middle of picture but from a distance you can hardly notice, I use it mostly for listening to music through my stereo."
2,I have sound. Hooray?,"So I plug in everything as it should be plugged in ... and I get sound. No video. That rather defeats the purpose of the cable, in my opinion. Maybe someone else will have better luck."
5,A forgotten gem,"I love Isaac Asimov, and when I saw this old book at a used book store I couldn't resist! It was interestingly written, with Isaac Asimov not being the narrator - and introducing himself as a character! There are footnotes that will crack you up (the banter between Isaac and the ""person"" that is the narrator in the book is wonderful) and, best of all, a really great, twisted whodunit. The ending came together beautifully and unexpectedly, all written by a great (fantastic?) writer! I would highly recommend it, as well as his ""Black Widower"" short stories - if you can find them."
4,A mystery by Asimov,"Sudden death at the publishing world's glittering annual convention. When the acclaimed protégé of writer Darius Just suddenly turns up dead at the annual convention of the American Booksellers Association, chaos and confusion sweep the autographing sessions, the buffet tables, the bars, and the famed hospitality suites. Darius is certain he can discover the murder. But only if the murderer doesn't find him first.."
5,Another great book for my collection,"This is a very good book for those who can read the KJV of the Holy Bible, but can't really understand it. It is written in plain English and has alot of the Hebrew words at the bottom for reference. The only issue I have with this product is the Apocrypha, I'm not real sure what that is, but with a little time and research I'm sure I will figure it out.I would also like to take the time to thank the seller for packaging the product so well and sending in out in a prompt timly manner. I received the product well within the time I was suppose to and when I got it; it was as described. It had some wear to it, but it was still in amazingly good shape and I intend to use it for years to come."
5,Easy to read. Enables a greater understanding of God's word!,Just loved it. Inexpensive and a pleasure to read and study.
5,Revised Standard Version Bible,"Great size, nicely bound with paper cover, readable print, includes concordance. Nice, sturdy addition to a study library."
4,NRSV review,"I don't know much about the Bible; so I cannot base my review upon content. However, the book was shipped in the time and condition in which I was promised"
1,This is a dumbed down version of a classic,We have an old Form Fitter that my daughter loves but many of the shapes are missing. So I decided to purhcase a new one on Amazon. What a huge dissapointment! The classic Form Fitter had 18 different geometric shapes: 3 different triangles; trapazoid; oval; ellispe; octago... to name a few. This new basic one has only 9. Boring!I can't understand why Playskool dumbed it down but I'm very dissapointed. Since I can't return it now (my daughter ripped the box) I will probably give it away to Goodwill. Our old one with only 10 pieces left is still better than the new one.
2,Fun for me and baby,"I love this toy, but I'm not sure about my 9 month old daughter. She is still learning how to use it and is more interested in chewing on the pieces. She does like to watch me dump the pieces out and put them back in. I like it because it's nice and simple and does not require batteries."
3,"Great concept, not the best sorter out there",This shape sorter is a super concept. The level of difficulty is a full step above the popular round red/blue sorter since there are more pieces and sides. The fact that the box top is not attached and cannot be replaced easily by my 2 1/2 year old requires that she always have assistance and cannot explore it over and over on her own. My recommendation is to stick with other sorters or to be willing to help your child patiently until they are older.
2,I got what I paid for..,I bought this for my son for [$] knowing that playskool was a pretty good brand..I was wrong about this toy. The top comes off even if you barely touch it..so my son just puts them in the big opening..that dosent teach much..I wouldnt purchase it for anyone and I will look for a new shape sorter for my son.
4,Blah!,"We got this toy for my 16 month old, hoping she would grow into it. Well I'd say she has a lot of growing to do. Even I have to concentrate to get the shapes right. The top keeps coming off or getting stuck inside. We do have fun playing together with the shapes and me giving her hints where to put the shapes. I'm sure there is a better shape sorter out there. I would expext better from playskool. The toy wasn't too expensive for a box with plastic shapes."
2,Too Flimsy!,"I was not impressed with the sorter box. It is very flimsy, and the top is always falling off. My child uses it as a basket instead of a sorter. Had to buy a different sorter."
3,An adequate shape sorter,I watched my daughter play with all of the different shape sorters and this was not one of her favorites. The shapes are difficult to get into the box. A far superior model is the Ambi one. It was by far the favorite at our local parenting center.
5,So much to learn in one box,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 14 months old. First he used to toss the pieces around and have fun piling them togather. Gradually he started to notice that these peices can fit in certain places (with a little help from me at the beginning) and then started to learn to match the shapes. I also used it to teach him colors and how to count the blocks while he is putting them in. Now he is 2 and a half years old, he can identify the shapes by name and color and can fit any piece in its place in no time. He still has a lot of fun playing with it. As for durability the box cover gets seperated very easily, but it can also be fitted back on fast."
4,Blue not yellow,"While we haven't taken this out of the box yet, it seems decent for the price. However, I was expecting a yellow block as pictured (for my little girl) and the one I received was blue. If you are picky about the color be careful."
4,Good Shape Sorter Toy,I like this sorter b/c it closes securily and my son knows how to open it easliy as well. He is still learning to put the right shapes in to the holes but overall a good toy.
5,Colorful shapes + textures + 6 sides = FUN LEARNING!,The features that caught my attention to this learning toy were the different shape blocks and textures that each block has. I like the fact that some of the shapes are similar to other shapes which presents more of a challenge for our child and also helps in learning to match textures as well. A favorite learning toy that doesn't require batteries!
2,there are cuter ones out there,"There are much cuter shape sorters available that also may be more fun. I always had to coax my kids to play with this, its not all that appealing, but I like the choice of nine shapes and it is a good way for a child to learn those shapes. A good feature is the lid snaps shut which means pieces dont get lost in the toy box. Little ones will need help opening it though."
2,WRong ITEM!!!,Do not order this toy. They will ship you the item that is NOT in the picture -- I wanted the shape box with the 18 different shapes. They sent me the cheesy cheap new one with only 10 or 12 shapes. cheap!I'm returning it right away.
3,Very Challenging Shape Sorter,"I bought this shape sorter for my 18 month old daughter because she had mastered the other one that we had. I thought she would enjoy more of a challenge. Since this shape sorter has so many sides and shapes, I thought she would enjoy it. Instead, she is just very frustrated. It's too hard for her and it makes her angry. I have to sit with her and rotate the block for her until she finds the right shape. I also have to open the lid for her to get the shapes out. This product is recommended for ages 18+ months, but I would recommend it for over 2 to avoid frustration. It is a great teaching toy, though and I find it to be very durable."
5,Very good sorter,My 9-month old loves to play with this. He can't put the shapes into the box yet but he is trying. Good quality construction.
5,Playskool shape sorter,"This is a very solid, durable toy, with educational potential that utilizes manual dexterity. The size is just about right for playing and storage. There are shapes on all six sides of the cube, which makes it more interesting than some similar toys."
3,For your above average shape sorter,"This is a great shape sorter with many different types of shapes. The shapes also have different colors and textures that coordinate with the side of the cube that the shape fits into. I would pay close attention to the age range on the toy, because it is not for very young babies, who might get frustrated at not being able to fit the shapes in the holes. I would say it's appropriate for 18 mos and up."
3,Rosle Silicone 10 inch spatula white,"This spatula is really nice, but difficult to handle when mixing thick ingredients. It cleans up well and doesn't stain, but if you plan to use to mix thick ingredients with a lot of flour a spatula with a more solid handle is better."
3,Feminist science fiction,"In a dystopian future where the Krischan church holds power over all of Britain, a young missionary begins to question the teachings of her church and her assumptions about people and society. I mostly enjoyed it, though sometimes it was heavy on what I call ""70's feminism."""
3,Yawn,Too much of this book is on the history of the United States Line and other ships. A few rare photos but the rest can be seen free on the web. Best book on the Big U is called SS UNITED STATES ISBN: 1-56311-824-6 It is like $35 or so. Pass this one and spend the extra $15-$20. On the plus side the book is informative and there are a few pictures never seen anywhere. My picture collection at the SS UNITED STATES Yahoo! Group is better and free ! Look in the pictures section and seek the James Varela collection.
2,Not much on the SS United States in here,"I completely agree with James Varela. The title is a complete misrepresentation. If they titled it ""Picture History of the SS United States & about 20 other U.S. ships"" it would have been fine, and I would not have bought the book. There's really not a lot here on the SS United States, and it was maddening to keep reading and reading about other ships before I finally reached the small section in the back on it. Imagine if the ""Picture History of the Normandie"" had a history of every other ship in the French Line and, at the back, a few pages & photos of the Normandie. That's pretty much what you're getting here."
4,Nice book,"I enjoy old cruise ship photos and stories and this book certainly has a lot of them. It is an easy read. I liked it, although I bopught it thinking it was only about the SS United States and that is a small part of it."
3,Lost History,This book is a pictorial history of US flagged passenger liners in addition to the SS United States. Unfortunately it lacks color pictures but still presents a vivid image of an age passed by. This is a good jumping off point for further study in this industry and how it was lost to us. Due to shortsightedness of many all of the fittings and furnishings of the SS United States were sold in an auction so they can never be fully reassembled. Beautiful yet sad.
3,MORE INTERIOR PICTURES PLEASE,"OVER HALF OF THE BOOK REPORTS THE HISTORY OF THE USLINE AND PREVIOUS SHIPS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE SS UNITED STATES' IMAGES ARE TOO FEW IN NUMBER"
4,Title is misleading,"This book is worth the money, but if you are wanting the ""History of the SS United States,"" you are going to be somewhat disappointed. A great deal of this book is devoted to other ships, some that belonged to United States Lines and some to affilitated lines. It has good sized, sharp pictures and a good deal of information- particularly about how United States lines put themselves out of business."
1,not too impressed,this toy is a little on the LOUD side. Our baby seems a little afraid of it. I don't recommend it.
4,Love to Hate,"My 4 month old son loved this toy, and still does at nine months. He loves to make the smile spin. The music has a very soothing effect on him in its repetitiveness. Unfortunately, there is no off switch, and unless placed totally flat upside down it will start to play by itself. Very annoying when your son has just gone to sleep in the same room."
2,"heard alot of hype about it, but my girls don't play with it","This seemed to be a much advertised, supposedly much sought after doll. I'd even heard a conversation between parents in a local store dismayed because the store was sold out of this doll shortly before Christmas. But Christmas morning, the doll was taken out of the packaging, and neither of my daughters (ages 5 and 8) have played with it since. It's still sitting on the table where it was placed after being removed from the packaging. Another much commercialized version of Barbie, but if the kids aren't going to play with it, what's the point?"
4,what i think of this product,"I really like Barbie rapunzel, because I have three daughters and they love her! My daughters all love them! She has so many accesories and my daughters love to collect them all and they love to play with all the different barbies and collect all the different barbie accesories."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"My 6 year old loves This doll but the glitter comes off,brush plays high anoying pitched music,and the hair is one big problem, It gets tangled or even scattered to the winds.This rapunzel barbie is not durable as well.My 11 year old son accidentaly pulled barbie's head and it broke I could'nt put it on. My 6 year old cried for 2hrs. She knew my son just did it on accident. I was so disapointed(ashamed) that I wasted 10 dollars on this junk!"
3,What my 4 yr old wanted for Christmas,Though my daughter can't stop talking about how happy she is that Santa brought her this doll for Christmas--I have to say I was disappointed. The gold glitter comes off of the dress all over the house. The hair piece looks kind of ratty and the hairbrush plays high pitched annoying music. What was Santa thinking?
3,Hair is a problem,My daughter received this doll for her birthday in October and the hair extension piece will not reattach after it is removed so now she looks like a regular barbie.
5,Beautiful Doll great for your little princess!!!,My Daughter got this doll and all that goes with it for her birthday. She loves it and loves the movie. It is a really beautiful doll!! Make sure you get the movie to go along with the dolls. The movie isn't painful at all for parents.
4,I Could've Bought Something Else,"this doll is pretty, with her long hair, and pink dress. But there's glitter on her dress, and it gets everywhere. Her crown is made to be stuck on her hair, and I thought that was inconvenient. There's a hole on top of her head that has her hair in it. There's a string on the back of the doll. If you pull it, then her hair gets short, and when you pull it, it gets longer. The hole is annoying. Whenever I play with it, I think that I could've chosen a better doll. I'm not saying that I don't like this doll. I'm saying that I could've chosen better."
3,I can't really rate this on the game,"I bought this becuase I was looking for a small aluminimum case for something completely unrelated, so I cannot rate the game. But this is NOT an aluminim case, it is a cardboard case covered with plastic and some aluminim hardware."
3,Cute,This Deluxe Librarian Action Figure is only for a Librarian who wants to get a good laugh. This is an outdated toy so the box was a little tattered but otherwise in okay condition. The seller packaged the toy well.
4,Librarian action figure,"As a former librarian and a retiree who is a couch potato, this gave a lot of laughs to friends who know me. Lots of fun."
3,Barbie Barbie Barbie,"My daughters love Barbie, so naturally when they saw the Barbie train, they had to have it This has to be one of the worst made toys that Mattel has put out. The sounds are terrible and it is far from what I expected!! But my girls love it cause its for Barbie Come on Mattel, you can do better!!!!!"
1,Barbie Travel Train,"I am very disappointed in the Barbie Travel Train I purchased for my twin daughters at Christmas.The item was highly overpriced, missing pieces, and far too fragile for 4 1/2 year olds to play with.I would not recommend this toy for little girls or boys."
4,Shadow of your smile Dear Heart,"The Songs are Beautifull, only as can be sung by Andy Williams himself.Must collector album for Andy Williams fans. al chauhan"
5,A Must Read,"I have never written a review on Amazon before, but the negative feedback this book is getting needs to be overcome. This book is a must read for any denominational worker. Paul Borden's leadership has resulted in the only denominational entity in this century that has ""turned around"" a majority of plateaued and declining churches. The uniqueness of this accomplishment makes this a must read. As a Ph.D. and church consultant for over twenty years, this book makes a significant contribution to the field of church growth. To get a better insight into how the denomination helped these churches, read the trilogy--this book, ""Direct Hit"" by Paul Borden and ""Winning on Purpose"" by John Kaiser."
4,The Church's mission,If you understand a Church to be a mission outpost and that most of the work of being a follower of Christ is outside of the Church walls -- this book is an excellent account how the American Baptist have turned around many of their Churches in the Western USA.
5,Cute Christmas DVD...good message,"I bought this for my 3yr. old granddaughter based on Amazon reviews. I personally think it is ok, but my granddaughter LOVES IT! We watch it over and over again and it fits the bill for her...which is most important..what she thinks, not Nana.Therefore I give it 5 stars!"
2,Good phone function with POOR battery,"I agree with the gentleman who had the comment on the poor battery performance. I had this phone about 10 days ago and I noticed this problem already. The camera has a poor quality as well. You can see strange shining from the high lighted part of the picture. The most serious problem would be the poor battery performance. I took a test on this cell phone since I got this cell phone new. It can only last about 3 days w/t any call or camera use, and the call time could only last less than a hour. After the a call, the phone will die very soon. which means you'll have to get the travel charger wherever you go. Its battery life is even worse than my old NOkia cellphone. I'm returning it."
4,Great basic phone,"I had this phone for 4 years and just gave it away for an upgrade, which turn out to be a mistake. The ringers are loud, very sturdy especially if you place a leather cover on it. It may not be a MP3 player with all the BELLS AND WHISTLES but the radio is a great feature that others ""wish they had"". I've owned nothing but Nokias and have never had any mechanical issues with their phones. If your looking for something basic (radio, phone, ringers, text and some internet) this is a very dependable phone, despite the small display/keypad."
1,DO NOT BUY,I had this phone for about three months and i hated it. first of all the camera was HORRIBLE. this is the worst camera phone i have ever had. the vision was also very slow and often quit on me. the battery was also HORRIBLE. i got about 3/5 of a day without charging it. the reception was the only good thing. i never had a droped call. but overall i would not advise this phone to anyone in any age group.
3,Hissssss & Camera is just name sake!,"Pros:Decent battery lifeYou can set profiles and each profile having a diffrent setting for ringer,screensaver etcYou can group your contacts as VIP,Family etc and have the phone ring only when it is a call from family ..Cons:There is always a constant hiss on the speaker.( i am comparing this to my sanyo)Squeaky noise- looks like something is going to fall off.. whenever you press a button you hear the sqeak!Camera is absolutely useless!.. Minimal resolutionSpeakerphone is not loud.I would want to use a speakerphone when i drive, This is not loud enough for the road noise. I can hardly hear anyone ( I live in NJ .. so you know that i would drive slow!)"
4,Nice Compact Full featured phone,"I like this phone, many features - camera, infra red to synch with my laptop, Nokia easy menus, pictures assigned to contacts."
1,"Lousy Battery,Dangerous dialing, bad programming","Sprint is great, but this phone is not. I bought it for my wife since it matched the UI on her old ATT nokia. She HATES this phone for three reasons:1. My wife needs to charge it every night, whether she has used it or not. Sprint says this is normal because it has a small battery.2. The buttons are impossible to use when you are driving since they flow together.3. When you go to unlock the phone the screen doesn't light upIf Nokia came out with a battery that lasted twice as long - even if the phone ended up bigger - we could deal with it. As it is I have been directed by ""she who must be obeyed"" to get her the new Treo when it ships, or any other sprint phone except this piece of junk."
1,EPA DHA Balanced,"Was asked to purchase for my step-Mom. A doctors news letter suggested its use for Alzheimer's, along with four other products."
1,Inadequate for even a beginner,"As a beginning Italian student, I find many more words missing than present in this little book. There are thirty thousand entries while several pocket dictionaries have more than twice that many. Avoid this book."
1,Look for another dictionary,That's all. Don't waste your money as I did.This is the only one of my many pocket-size dictionaries I am highly dissapointed in. I could not find about eight words out of ten.
4,Great POCKET dictionary!,"I have many Italian dictionaries and grammar books and this is by far my favourite for everyday Italian. I have spent the past two years living in Florence and I can say that as far as a dictionary to carry around with you, it is both compact and efficient. Many words are sacrificed for its compact size, but for carrying around and travelling it is very good. If a larger more detailed dictionary is what you are looking for, I would suggest the Oxford color edition, which contains over 50,000 words, verb charts, and irregular conjugations."
5,Hold Steady,"I love this album. I adore it. I burnt a hole in it. It is not Separation Sunday, but Killer Parties and Most People are DJs are still 2 of my favorite Hold Steady songs.Why, oh why, hasn't the license holder for Lifter Puller re-released those albums yet?"
3,Interesting but only one great song,I saw the video for the Hold Steady song the Swish and I thought it was the best thing I'd seen in quite a while. Then I picked up the disc and was somewhat dissapointed. It gets old fast and is pretty redundant. I listened to it a few times and will probably keep it in my collection just for the one song (Swish) but I wouldn't put it in my rotation.I would like and go see em live though if I had the chance
5,"Honestly, how can you give this <5 stars? It deserves 6.",Unbelievable little piece of Rock'n'Roll here. Just what rock music needed -- a little more rock'n'roll and a little less whining. This is a destined-to-be-classic album by the BEST ROCK & ROLL BAND IN AMERICA.
2,Not Very Good,"I found out about The Hold Steady from a blurb in G Q.They sounded like the type of band I like,so I bought this CD.Oh,my god,does this stuff suck.The songs are all overwrought cliches and while the musicianship is quite good,the lead talker,(no,he couldn't carry a tune in a bucket) is less than worthless.All I can say is that I won't waste any more of my money on this band."
1,Not Made in Germany but China,This product is not made in Germany as listing indicates. It clearly says on the handle that it is made in China! Rosle has moved manufacturing to China at a rapid pace but is not budging on high prices.
2,Not worth the money,"Purchased this, expecting better functionality. Sure it doesn't rust, but my $5 Wustoff pealer works much better."
2,Sign Language Cards for babies,I was dissapointed in these cards. Many of the signs they are promoting for babies are not ASL. It seems that if you wish to teach your babies sign language it should at least be an already established language. No reason to reinvent the wheel.
2,this is not a book,"Just to be clear. this is not a hardback book. It is a very small box of 25 cards with one sign on each side and a tiny pamphlet. Not what I was expecting at all. Oh well, the cards are OK. Would have liked bigger cleared pictures to share with baby. If I was expecting a tiny box of cards I would probably give it 3 stars. There are some useful signs in the collection. Personally I was disapointed. This should have cost $3.50, not $10."
1,Save your money,"As the mother of a four month old, I read everything I can get my hands on about anything baby-related, and have recently been fascinated by the idea of signing with my daughter. I've been planning to research and choose a book to learn more but on a whim saw this little kit and picked it up despite the inflated price, considering it's just a small box with a ""book"" and 25 cards. The book is a complete joke, don't be fooled by the description saying it's 16 pages. Minus the one line intro, at least six blank pages for ""notes"", etc. there ends up being about 3 pages about signing with your baby and let me tell you you can live without the information.The flashcard idea is a good one, but the words are limited. I'm not sure how they decided what words to include but there's not even one for ""cry"". The pictures are difficult to interpret as well. I think my money's better spent on a simple ASL dictionary."
1,I like Signing Time better,"The cards are not useful, limited vocabulary, and uninteresting both for baby and for me. I like the Signing Time books and DVDs a million times better, have learned more and had fun doing it."
5,"Great Grater, though not cheap",It is a solid product and holds really well in hand. It does take a few times use for you to get used to how to hold it.
3,good...but not much of a maxi-single,"Not sure why they didn't put ALL the mixes of both songs, considering there are a few left off from the import singles. There's really not much in the way of long remixes. Here you just get:1. Here I Go Impossible Again (single mix) (3:30)2. All This Time Still Falling Out of Love (3:31)3. Here I Go (nu-german compu-soul mix) (3:36)4. All This Time (Shanghai Surprise mix) (7:39)the compu-soul mix of Here I Go isn't anything unique, sounds like it could easily fit on a regular erasure album of synth pop upbeat dance tunes. The real gem is the Shanghai Surprise mix of All This Time, the longest mix on here, and a fast-paced euro nrg house track."
4,The Best Single from Nightbird,"This is the third (and probably last) single from the album ""Nightbird."" It pairs the two songs that recieved the most votes for best song on the album at the official Erasure site. Unfortunately, it doesn't contain all of the remixes that were released in England, but does include the best of the bunch--the Shanghi Surprise mix of ""All this time."" This is the real reason to get this CD."
5,The best CD single from this album,"Every mix is catchy and very satisfying -- no disappointments here. Since there are only two mixes per song, it's a great listen all the way through and each composition gets a worthy makeover. These songs are the catchiest on the album and should've been released as first singles. Why ""All This Time Still Falling Out of Love"" hasn't made it to the dance charts yet is a mystery. This is Erasure in its finest, 100% purest decadent and fun form."
3,Impossible Maxi Single,To complete my Erasure maxi single collection I had to get this one but had put it off and now I can see why. Unfortunatly this is not much of a maxi single at all. Its all single versions but the very last track. Its a good hi energy mix which I love of erasure but to spend near $8.00 for it is crazy. See about finding it for half that if you can.
5,Great tool for Dyslexics,My son is dyslexic and this is a great tool and book mark to have. I bought them and gave them out to his whole class...They all are using them now.
1,unnecessary,I was disappointed with these flimsy unsensational strips. I was envisioning something more sturdy - something I couldn't have made myself with a pair of scissors and some stiff paper. Definitely a waste of money. I should have given more thought to exactly what I was buying.
2,NOT SWEET!,I am used to using sucralose sweetener and this is not near as sweet. I had to use 7 packets to sweeten my coffeeand it had a strange taste that I didn't like.
1,worst sandal ever,"My 2 year old daughter has always worn Stride Rite shoes. They have always fit her well. This particular model is HORRIBLE! It digs into her skin and she screams no when I try to put them on her. I put some molefoam in them and that helped a little(she doesn't scream about them with the molefoam), but her feet still get blisters and indentations in her foot(just not as severe as without the molefoam). This sandal is a poor design. Why would stride rite have rubber on the inside of the strap over the foot that has a texturized rubber? That's what leaves an indentation in her foot."
5,Great shoes- cant get her out of them !!,My first pair of shoes I ordered was a size7- which I just measured my daughters feet- however when the shoes arrived they were too small.I think due to short back strap- her foot sits farther forward thus causing the need to have a larger size. After ordering a size 8- the shoe fits perfect and I can not get her out of the sandals. She literally wore them to bed. Great long velcro straps allows her to be able to take her own shoes off and on.
1,Hurts his poor little feet.,"My 18 month old son loves wearing his shoes, specifically his Stride Rite tennies. So I figured Stride Rite was the best for sandals. Just putting them on his feet for less than a minute, he was yelling ""Off! Off!"" I tried five different times to get him to wear them - just aruond the room. Each time with the same expression. I returned them. They must have been rubbing his little feet wrong. I guess I need to try them on in the stores so I know that they dont rub."
2,Very hard to read. A collection of recipes from earlier times.,These aren't recipes in the usual sense. You have to pick the quantities and ingredients out of a paragraph with the recipe's title on top.
1,Absolutely laughable conspiracy theories,"The very first book written on the case to include conspiracy theories! Wow!Not only was Manson (a third grade dropout) a masterful orator, drug guru, and spiritual demon worshiper, but was so out of this world he thought the Beatles were talking to him while he tripped on LSD!Strangely, nobody else in California dropping acid tabs like candy ever heard any secret messages, but, that was because Manson was conjuring demons and starting race wars!In reality this book falls into the trash bin of history as perhaps the most dishonest, confused, muddled work ever to be created around a criminal trial."
3,Informative,"Found that the copyright was older than I thought, so I don't know if there are newer, updated books on sprouting. It was interesting reading, and informative."
2,Put my finger where?,Nothing new is offered here and many of his listed target points are ineffective. Kirby's reputation has apparently given him delusions of adequacy.
5,Top resource in my library,"Let's face it, nerve techniques and pinch holds don't work in real life fight for survival. But, if your against a wall with no hope for survival, this books has moves that give you a chance. You have nothing to lose. Put together with the standard Jiu Jistsu moves, it will complete your knowledge of Jiu Jistsu."
5,Outstanding work on neglected aspect of jujutsu,"As he did in his ""Beginner"" and ""Intermediate"" jujutsu books, George Kirby has written a lucid work that strikes an excellent balance between fighting theory and practical application. Very highly recommended."
4,This Robot is Huge!,"If you thought that the Gen 1 Metroplex was big, wait till you see this one. He is already big in work mode but in battle mode he is HUGE! and his battle axe Sparkrinder is a weapon like no other. The drillbit minicon adds as a cool claw weapon. This robot stands 13'' in battle mode your kids will love this Giant planets leader. Don't pay more than $34.99 for it, there are plenty of it at the stores."
5,Roesle Whisk - Excellent !!!,"Very pleased with this Rosle whisk as I have been with all of the dozen or more products I have of theirs. With the exception of the manual can opener which I have had trouble with and no longer use, the quality of construction, balance, look and feel are consistently outstanding. About half of my items go back to when they were made in Germany rather then in China as they are now. I can state that I have noted no reduction in the quality of the product. They are very pricey but if one is patient on Amazon all have eventually gone on sale for nice savings. I simply put then in my cart, saved for later. I check the cart regularly and when an item has a good discount it is moved into the active cart and purchased."
4,Great Whisker,"Love the Rosle design and quality i Tn all of their kitchen tools, This is no exception. It is the right size and weight to make using it a great cooking expeinece."
1,Made in China???,"I can't believe after buying Rosle tools for years that the whisk I just got yeasterday is not made in Germany but China. On the label on the whisk it says China and yet in the review it says twice ""Made in Germany"". Is anything by Rosle made in Germany anymore?"
5,Essential Outdoor Reading,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in preservation and those who simply love nature writing. I read this book before reading ""The Wild Muir"". In comparison, this one is obviously a more thorough overview of Muir's life. Reading this book first makes ""Wild Muir"" more enjoyable....kinda like reading a novel before watching a movie based on it."
2,Awful smell and feel,For anyone considering buying this... it smells like rubber and its sticky! ick! I'm returning it because it isn't smooth and I would not put it anywhere near my genitals! Also the drawstring is very long and pointless. Oh and it's solid blue.. not this translucent blue like in the picture!
4,Great doo wop music!,What can I say? I love this cd! I can listen to it no matter what mood Im in and I love the arrangements the group used. Their vocals are superb and great harmonizing!
4,Very good ocular physiology text,I am working on a model of eye fatigue and this text has all the nit picky histological details I was looking for.
2,There are better out there,"I don't like this spatula at all. The rubber end is too small and rigid to be useful. The handle may be useful if you like to hang your utensils, but it's not comfortable to hold for long periods or if you have to use a lot of force. I got rid of mine. There are much better ones out there."
4,One of the best lesser-known bands,"The Teddy Powell Orchestra was an amazing outfit - it played middle-of-the-road swing, but with terrific drive and panache.George T. Simon when writing his band reviews in the 1940s often raved about the Powell band's performances. These recordings are pretty typical of its repertoire, verging from killer-diller numbers to Tin-Pan alley vocals of the period. Powell managed to always keep on the side of good taste, and in some cases, produced recordings of the highest musical quality. Just listen to ""Tapestry in Blue""....."
1,Boring...,"This was one of the most boring regencies I have read in a while. The story is told from Lila's point of view. Many members of a family gather in hope of gaining an inheritance. Lisa fancies herself in love with the gorgeous Alastair. Eventually, she sees him as shallow, etc, and falls for the dark, brooding Earl. There is 0 chemistry, boring dialogue and a silly mystery in this story. Also, the ending was too weird with Alastair. Especially in the light that Ms. Hazard now has a story about Alastair. Readers of this book would be hard pressed to see him in a romanctic light, considering the end."
4,Regency Romance or perhaps a who-dunn-it,"This book by Barbara Hazard is a little different, it definitely evolves there are elements of a gothic novel at the start, it seems then to move into a who-dunn-it, complete with twists and red herrings and finishes as a traditional Regency Romance. Written in the first person, I was a little surprised by one character mentioning a chance of frostbite in Scotland by the sea but not bad overall. More a 3 and a half stars than a 4."
4,"Worhty topic, well-written and applicable","Being a nerd of a new parent, I have read through many tomes and this one gets it about right. Written thoughtfully, there is applicable guidance here and good food for thought. Look forward to reading the other book.Some of the topics can seem common-sense but it serves as a good study reminder when parenting throws curveballs. Also, this is written in intelligent adult language and doesn't dumb-down the useful psychological discussion."
2,Case Study after Case Study,"Oy! If I have to read one more 'great save' case by these authors/psychologists, I will pull out my hair. This book was one case study after another outlining in great detail what their patients said and did and how wonderfully the authors managed to break through in each case, solving all problems for the troubled family, leaving them all happy and saved as the doctors ride gloriously into the sunset. Ugh! I wanted more substance, more ""this is what you need to do"". There was plenty of good advice in this book, but usually it came in the first sentence or at the end of a case study. By the end of the book, I was skipping all the case studies and just searching around for the moral of the story and looking for their not bad advice. I think if the authors had simply printed out their observations and suggestions in outline form, the book would be much more helpful and most importantly, shorter."
1,Very little to do w/ resilience,"I was really disappointed with this book. In general it's about building up children's self-esteem, but doesn't focus on helping children develop resilience with daily disappointments or problems (bullies, not making a soccer goal, etc.) Self esteem is very different from resilience. Instead, I'd recommend two books: Blessings of the Skinned Knee and Mindset. Blessings is based on practical/current applications from the Torah; I am not Jewish and still found this book to be very helpful/wonderful. The books don't have chapters on ""resilience"", but the overall info from both has been very helpful in that area."
2,Might be good if I actually read it.,"Bought this and barely cracked it open. A better choice, which I think consolidates the best of this book with others, is ""Loving Without Spoiling""."
5,A wonderful book for parents.,"I think that this book is fabulous. The advice is definately top rate. They have examples from their practice to show how their theories work and how they could be helpful for you. I highly recommend this book. I checked this out at the library and then bought a copy, because I know I will be refering to this book again and again."
1,fat caliper for fat people,This Caliper is for FAT people. This will not work well if you are an athlete or wish to watch the way your body fluxuates. If your are Truly FAT and plan to loose 40 lbs. than this may work for you. The instructions that accompany this device arn't all that helpfull and if your already thin and wnat a precise mesurment DONT waist the money on this devise.
3,Mediocre tool for assessing body fat,"Assessing your body fat is an accurate method of determining your level of fitness and health.This caliper is small and convenient. However, there are pitfalls. As you squeeze your skin fold, there is some variability from one measurement to the next due to its light construction. It is not durable over time with repetetive use and I question its validity beyond a 1 year time interval. Mine broke a little over 15 months at the 'hinge' opposite to the slide rule.ConclusionIt is a portable, small tool for assessing your body composition but its durability over time is questionable (as is its accuracy). Use of the tool has a learning curve for accurate assessment."
4,Farley's last bang of non-stop laughter!,"Almost Heroes is a crack-up comedy starring the late SNL castmember Chris Farley (Tommy Boy), Friends star Matthew Perry, Eugene Levy (American Pie), and Kevin Dunn (Stir Of Echoes).This light-hearted funfest set in 18th century America follows a group of explorers led by Leslie Edwards, played by Perry, who is attempting to discover the west before Lewis and Clark get there. Along for the journey is an obese and short tempered Bartholomew Hunt, played hysterically by Farley, a gorgeous Native princess Shaquinna, played by Lisa Barbuscia, her nasty French hubby Guy Fontenot, played by Levy, and a group of imbeciles.Almost Heroes was Chris Farley's last bang of non-stop laughter; he died only five months before the movie's theatrical release.RecommendedB"
4,it's good fun,It's good fun and one of Matthew Perry's better movies. He can really fill in a cinema movie - if it's the right kind of thing. He also looks healthier here than in e.g. Serving Sara.
1,Don't bother,"No plot, Matthew Perry plays a flake, Farley has funny moments, but not enough to warrant finishing movie. Didn't come near being funny."
3,almost heros,"OK movie. Some funny parts, some vulgar parts, but I guess that's normal for Chris Farley."
4,Gets better the more you watch it!,"I saw this movie in the theatres and I was disappointed. But then I rented it and got all the little jokes that I missed and by the third viewing, I really liked this movie. I'm a big Farley fan and I would rank this movie right under Tommy Boy as one of his best films he's done. The supporting cast is also very funny. There are so many good laughs in this film. Anyone who looks at my woman, I KILL HIM! The horse sh*t story. Revenge is sweet sir! Do you realize your maiden is made of straw? When they take turns looking through the binocular. This movie definately grows on you. It's definately got some laughs that are definately worth your while if you are a Farly or goofy comedy fan. I hope they make this onto DVD someday! If you like Joe Dirt, Dirty Work, or Tommy Boy, you'll like this movie. If not, try it 2 more times."
5,Almost Heroes,"I just loved this movie. It is too bad that this was one of Farley's last movies though. I enjoyed the scene after Farley's told them about the sadistic animals of the wild. Then one of the crewmen spotted an animal on the bank and they all went crazy and started shooting at it with their guns and a boat cannon. Farley told them it was only a squirrel then one of the crewman yelled, ""He's got something in his hands!"" And they all went crazy again shooting at it. I would recommend this movie to anyone and especially those Chris Farley fans."
1,MY GRADE: D plus to C minus,"Where's the humor? Oh, right. They forgot about that part even though they had Chris Farley and Matthew Perry starring. I could only survive ten minutes before I chucked that DVD into the air and blew it away with a howitzer. WHEN WATCHED: November 2011 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus."
3,A little funny,Silly and only a little funny movie for guys rather then girls (in terms of sense of humor).
1,Farley's last laugh .......,"Watch this if you can get it for free or very cheap! It has a few laughs, a few chuckles, and many sad moments. I know this is a better movie than I could make - which is why nobody is paying me to make movies! Don't watch unless you're a Chris Farley fan ..."
2,A SAD ENDING TO CHRIS FARLEY'S FILM CAREER! 1 1/2 STARS!,"I never got to see this film which is Farley's last film and now that I have, I wish I never did. Chris Farley who was a very funny man never reached his potential in films, even those who are not a fan of his ""in your face"" humor would have to admit to finding at least one thing he did hysterical. 'Tommy Boy' is by far his crowning achievement on film and probably the only film starring Farley worth owning. This film shows Chris bloated and worn out from years of excess and is kind of hard to watch. It's a sad way to cap off a career that gave so many people joy. This is purely for the Farley diehard fans only. I just couldn't bring myself to give this 1 star!"
2,Sad that this was Chris Farley's last film,"Not enough funny material, if it weren't for Chris this film wouldn't have been made I presume.All his other films were definitely better. You are missed CHRIS!"
1,almost funny,"okay, this needs to be done...it does not matter that this was chris farley's last movie. i am a big chris farley fan, but that doesn't mean that ALL of his movies will be funny. this movie is absolutely horrible. some of the ""dumb comedies"" grow on the viewer after 2 or 3 times, but this one will disappoint every time - i promise. you would think that this is a simple equation: chris farley, who's funny + matthew perry, who's funny = a funny movie. don't waste your time. no wait, in fact, watch it, then bash it here. let's bring down this very inaccurate 4 star rating."
2,Generally bad movie,"Despite positive reviews, this film turned out to be fairly bad and not that funny."
3,Not Bad!,This movie had it's moments. I was about the only good movie that tub of lard Farley ever made!
1,I hate to give this BILGE 1 Star!,"I saw this one on television recently, and if there was ever a ""no star rating"" this would get it (At least from me) Period comedies seldom work,(HISTORY OF THE WORLD, etc) especially when there are absolute no talents like Chris Farley and Perry. (Supposedly this was Farley's last film, he should have quit a LONG time ago)It is NOT funny or even mildly amusing, just a load of overdone juvenile humor and labored slapstick. Trying to turn the Lewis and Clark expedition into a joke was a major waste of time and money, which is what YOU will experience if you buy this tripe."
5,Farley and Perry are a smash and funny together,This movie is funny from the begin to the end. There is something going on every corner. You never know what Chris Farley is going to next like how he was on SNL. They could not have picked a better co star for Farley's sidekick which is Mathew Perry. He follows Farley's lead on every part of the movie. Perry really shows his dry humor on this movie and does it well but of course it is Farley who carries the movie along. You do not get board while watching the movie so set back and be ready to laugh all the way though. Btw each character has his own funny parts in the movie so it is the whole crew that will make you laugh and enjoy the movie.
5,It was a hillarios Movie,"I think ""Almost Heroes"" was a great movie. I could not stop luaghing and Chris Farley was a great actor!! If you have any sence of humor you will like it too. I definately think you should see it it will not be a waste of anything, time or money!!!!"
3,Charleston Ghosts,This is an interesting book about the ghosts of historic old Charleston and is a good read.
5,An exceptional book of history and paranormal,I first read this book as a child and when my paperback copy was destroyed I purchased a new hard cover copy. I still pick this book up on occasion for a wonderful trip back in time and into a touch of the spirit world.
4,small and light,"It works great but getting the cut started is different from a ""regular"" opener and can take a bit of getting used to."
5,Works Great!,"I bought this can opener after tossing out another cheap supermarket can opener. We saw that it was recommended by America's Test Kitchen as the best. My wife and I have been very pleased. Works effortlessly. Cleanly removes the lid with no food mess, no strain whatsoever. I would highly recommend it. The only time it may not be the perfect match is if you open canned tuna and use the cut lid to compress the tuna when draining. The lids when removed don't fit into the can. That hasn't been an issue for us. Great can opener!"
1,Throwing money away,"After a year it not longer works. When you pay $30 plus for a can opener, you expect it to last longer. I would not recommend it at ALL!!!!!"
1,Breaks quickly. Not covered by warranty if purchased through Amazon.,"Insamuch as I first liked this can opener, I absolutely do not recommend it because it stopped working after 2 years of light usage. There are many other reviews with the same issue - within first 2.5 years this can opener stops working. There is a lifetime manufacturer warranty in the USA for this product if purchased through their authorized dealer. Call 800-321-2226 and tell them you have a defective can opener. If their manager approves replacement, they will ask for you to mail yours to them for the exchange on a brand new one. Don't rely on this warranty though if you buy this item on Amazon, Amazon is not an authorized dealer with them."
2,"Rarely opened cans on single try, handle cracked off","While I thought this was a great idea, the actual experience of using one was not, at least with me. When it worked, it was as great as others rave about, it was great to have the lid re-usable. However that was often not the case. One has to have it level and angled just so; and if the can was dented, forget about it. Usually had to do two passes to get it opened, and stopped using it on condensed milk cans.Tried to use it over the holidays and the handle snapped in half.Sorry, simply not worth the money or effort. Too bad, it was a nice-looking gadget too."
2,The one time German engineering failed me,"I received this can opener as a gift and loved it until I tried to open a small can of tomato paste. Since then, my can opener shreds cans and leaves metal shavings all over the outside of the can. I have hurt myself on them several times. Sometimes the can opener works great, most of the time I have poor results and cannot even break the seal of a can of soup!"
5,I love this can opener,"This works way better than any other manual can opener I've used. It doesn't leave sharp edges and I haven't had any problems with it. Before purchasing this one, every can opener I bought didn't work right. It's nice to have one that works well (even if it was a little expensive)."
3,Roslie can opener,"Very hard to get used to, because its difficult to seat the opener correctly on the can to begin the process. Its overpriced. It does open cans leaving smooth edges. It is made well, with durable materials but is not user friendly. My wife just gave up because of the difficulties. I would not buy it again, and would like to send it back."
5,I don't understand German but......,After receiving my can opener I realized all the directions were written in German! Well after some trial and error I finally figured it out. Now that I have used it I really love it. It opens cans so neatly-no lids can fall into the can- and works so smoothly. It is very European in design and style-a nice edition to a cook's kitchen. I am glad that I have finally found a can opener that will last as well as be comfotable to use.
5,A lovely piece of equipment,"It's takes a couple of cans to get the hang of it, but then you'll wonder how you ever opened cans without it. Read the included instructions and follow the pictures til you figure it out.We've had other ""safety"" can openers that have been difficult to use and often necessitated going around the can several times. Not so with the Rosle. Go around once, and the lid is freed from the can.It's expensive, but well worth it. A joy to use and very easy to clean, should you splash something on it."
1,"High price, low quality. Buy a Kuhn-Rikon.","Effective until it failed after 18 months of occasional use. No longer grips the can edge. No response from the company. $30 piece of junk. Save your receipt. You will need to make warranty claims. Not durable. Poor design. This opener grabs the can parallel to the can side. The Kuhn-Rikon opener is a much better choice: much less expensive, grabs the can perpendicular to the side, giving a tighter grip on the edge, better leverage."
1,Doesn't last long - Buyers beware,I purchased this product due to the reputation Rosle has and due to they warranty the product for life. Yet when the product failed I cannot seem to figure out how to get it replaced. The gears have stripped out making it impossible to use. My wife cut her hand really bad trying to open a can with it after it failed but she was determined to open the can but this didn't happen. I had to run her to the emergency room and on the way home we stopped and purchased a can open because who knows how long it will take to get Rosle to replace it. I have written emails to the company with no replies yet. As fast as this oriduct failed I believe Rosle will have to either have to correct their design or send me a new can opener annualy on a scheduled basis. When the product works it works well but the product quality is poor if the gears strip out in a years time.
4,Great at first but now not so great?,"Yes this was great at doing it's task but roughly 2 yrs. later it has problems opening cans. Some can's it still works on and some it won't anymore. It's a gamble each time I need to use it. So I have my good old flip handle that cost me $3 at walmart to back me up and it does. Well when I got this opener I was under the impression that it would also last a lifetime or at least many years? But to my disappointment it failed. For the price it should last a lifetime. I have contacted the company and is waiting a reply to my issue, and to see what they will do for me?***UPDATE***They contacted me back via email and explain that their products have a LIFETIME WARRANTY with them, and gave me the address to ship it back. So know waiting for a new one...."
5,Quality at a Price,"I'm admittedly a bit wacky when it comes to manual can openers. I havea view that says that one day we may need to survive on canned goods, and I want to be sure we can easily and reliably open the cans. Hence this purchase, which some may see as extravagant, is really about peace of mind, just as much as the goodness of day-to-day, non-emergency use.This is a device that is not entirely intuitive. If you found one at a yard sale you might not figure out that it is a can opener. You alsowouldn't know to place the unit on the can, then turn the crank a half crank counter clockwise (to grab the can), and then turn clockwise (to open the can.)There you have it, my thesis on can openers. Do I graduate now?"
4,Interesting product,"Can opener works well, operates smoothly, but is not intuitive. We've also had problems with getting a fine metal shaving that needs to be picked out of the food."
2,"Loved it, it broke","This was great for almost two years. At almost $40 for a can opener, I don't expect it to break. It did -- no longer opens cans. I think a can with an extra wide lip caused the can opener to spread out somehow -- normal cans now can't be opened, the opener won't grip them tight enough.Buy another one? At $40, no chance."
4,"Great for pet food, lousy for olives","This can opener and I have a love hate relationship. I love it for pet food, as the lid can be put back on the can and the container can be put in the refridgerator. While for olives, the reseal lid makes it difficult to strain out the juice and leave the olives behind. You can do it by deforming the can but its a pain. On the other hand there are no sharp edges left after you open a can, so its safe for kids to use. The reason this works is that it cuts the side of the lid through the lip. Anyway I now have two can openers, this one and one of the old style."
2,Glad when it broke,"Bought this for a small fortune, it works as described by others. My trainer was thrilled with my upper body strength when I owned this opener. It took a lot of strength to work it, I carried on as it had been so expensive, but when it finally died after three years, I chucked it in relief and bought a Good Grips for a twentieth of the price. It works as well and I am going flabby. I'm getting the weights out!"
1,Rosle Can Opener,"I have never been able to attach the opener to a can; hence, I cannot open cans with it. Although it is useless, I have an an attractive tool hanging above my kitchen sink."
1,Made In CHINA,"I bought this can opener because the Amazon review said all Rosle products are made in Germany. I am willing to pay $33 (!) for a a product that is made employing people at fair wages, but not for one made in a country of slave wages and no environmental laws."
5,Am loving it again,"This can opener is a strike of genius. I had one for the past four years and the ease with which it opens any kind of can so smoothly that you can set it to your lips is nothing short of amazing. Unfortunately, after four years of daily use, the plastic handle became so brittle that it broke off. They should change the formula for whatever polymer their are using. But this is a minor complaints in the context of four years of pleasure."
1,Died Quickly,Rösle Can OpenerI purchased this can opener because I did not want sharp edges from opened cans around the kitchen or in the garbage. The Rosle can opener stopped opening cans after about seven months. My wife purchased a replacement from Target made by Chefmate for $9. It has performed superbly for two years. The Chefmate is also easier to operate ergonomically. Save money and frustation; don't buy this Rosle can opener.
3,Great design but...,"I love the design of this can opener - the look, the feel, and it worked like magic until one day it didn't work anymore. I guess it didn't work for all sizes of cans. I opened the regular sizes of cans and one day opened a big fruit cocktail can and ever since that time, it won't work with the regular size cans anymore. Now, I am buying a Kuhn Rikon Safety Lid Lifter Deluxe Can Opener, and hopefully this one won't fail on me."
2,Not worth the money in the long run.,"I've had this can opener for a few years now. Use it once or twice a week. Worked fantastic when it was new. About a month ago it stopped griping the can well. I cleaned it thinking that maybe that would help, but to no avail. Great concept, nicely executed, but longevity is not good."
2,Lasts only less than a year,"I cook from sctach most of the time, and don't use can product often. But mine stopped cutting and working correctly within less than a year. Very dissapointing!"
1,horrible can opener,"Because of the great reputation that Rosle has, I have purchased 4 of this can opener.However the first time I used it, it broke. The turning mechanism worn out immediately and the can was unable to turn. I went ahead and tried all 3 others and they all have similar problems. One of the blade wheel also retracted into the tool. Please adv how can a company, who strives on customer satisfaction, sells a product with such low quality??? I am very dissatisfied with this product and will never purchase again.For a $30+ can opener, my expectation is that it will last years!"
5,World's Best Can Opener,By far the best can opener on the market; nothing even comes close. Far superior to the Pampered Chef variety. Once the lid is removed it may be used to cover the can. There are absolutely no sharp edges which might generate a trip to the local ER. Beautifully simple!
1,Very Disappointed!,"The can opener worked well for the first 3 months, then it just stopped cutting the cans. And for the money that I spent on it, it should certainly last a lot longer."
1,Don't recommend this can opener,"I read about this can opener everywhere. Articles and reviews all said it was the best and you would never own another kind of can opener once you had one of these. Well-I bought one-+$30.00 for a can opener-yes, I feel stupid. It lasted almost one year before it completely failed. This is another hyped product that does not live up to claims. I feel the need to explain that I take care of all my 'stuff'. Thus, this can opener was not used for anything but the use for which it was meant. I might also add it probably got less use than a normal household because there are just two of us, one that does all the cooking. This product is a rip-off."
2,Little tricky to use but won't work now,"Had this unit for about 5 years. Overall, once you got figured out how to seat the opener on the can it worked very well and with little effort. It is trickier to lock it into place on some cans. Also, if a friend or neighbor is over helping prepare food and goes to use it - good luck unless they've used a similar type can opener. Now after about 5 years the unit has worn out and wont open any cans...however, that is longer than most can openers have lasted....then again, it's 2 to 3 times more $$ than the swing aways."
3,"looking good, works hard",The can opener does a really good job of opening a can. There are no sharp edges and the top of the can lifts off easily.One must have strong hands to turn the handle that advances the opener.It is quite a chore; an unforseen drawback.
5,A Superb Can Opener!,"Light weight and well balanced, this opener quickly aligns itself on the can accurately. You simply keep turning the handle until the resistance eases up. Back off the handle slightly and with a simple flip of the wrist, the lid comes off. Since it opens the can above the glue line, there are no sticky strands of glue. This one works much better than any I have used prior to now. A superb product, I highly recommend this one to anyone who ever needs to open a can."
1,Nickel? It rusts. It's not nickel. Nickel does not rust. Rubbish standard.,"This fan looks good, and at nearly $400, described as 'Nickel', it ought to be good quality. It's not. Little more than 12 months after fitting to outdoor lanai, with no direct rain, the surface plating is rusting off. Anyone who needs convincing can see our photos.What this product is, is cheap base metal with some kind of 'Nickel' (? maybe?) coating, which last a few months before lifting, to rust underneath.I have an option to return it at our full cost - it took 4 hours to install, and it will take the same to dismantle, so that's not viable. I'll probably have to replace it in a few months - that's cheaper and less time wasting. The replacement will not be this product again.DO NOT BUY THIS FAN IF YOU THINK IT WILL STAND UP TO OUTDOOR CONDITIONS: IT WON'T."
5,Exquisite Voice!!!,"What a set of pipes this woman has! Her voice is an absolute joy to listen to. She possesses every quality that great singers have -- perfect pitch and tone; power; beautiful phrasing and interpretation; and above all -- soul. It's an injustice that Trina hasn't achieved the level of musical fame that she so richly deserves. I purchased this CD after buying the Love Jones soundtrack and I fell in love with her version of Minnie Riperton's Inside My Love. ""Same Girl"" is an exceptional CD with several outstanding tracks including Dreaming Of One; Still The Same Girl; Losing My Mind; and Thinkin' Boutcha. Without a doubt though, the crown jewel is the track, Out/Gone -- 5 minutes and 45 seconds of musical perfection. I highly recommend this CD."
5,Beautiful Music,"I must admit this cd is very good and her voice is beautiful. I wish she would have gotten more airplay as this is real music. I've had this cd for awhile and have listened to it recently - the entire cd and how she is able to reach many with the power of her voice and it hits so close to home.She is a delight to your ears and there is music for every part of the relationship - joy, pain, transitioning (moving on and letting go), pure love.Great CD! Can't wait to hear more music from her soon."
4,THIS IS WHAT MUSIC SHOULD SOUND LIKE,"Trina Broussard isn't just another pretty face. She can really blow. I remember her from the ""Love Jones"" soundtrack, singing ""Inside My Love"", the Minnie Ripperton classic. I just want to know, ""What took her so long to get her own cd out?"" I especially like ""No Way Out."" Keep it coming!"
3,Not bad!,"I had only heard of Trina Broussard once before. She is good, I think that her talent was not pulled out by the music though. It's good stuff, but basic. I am a sucker for minor or intricate chords or even just a basic melody with a ""tight"" bridge or vamp. However, her voice is good and if I were to re-do the CD, I would keep some of the tracks!"
3,Product holds on a smooth surface,I purchased this as a Shower Grab Bar for a Handicap person. The item was only partially painted.. The seller made good my complaint.. The item works well on smooth surface. It has a 300 lb wt limit.. Great product for the money..
2,"loosened after aprox 1 mo., will not adhere","I purchased the bar for use in an area with little use (motorhome). After about a month of occasional use it was on the floor. I have cleaned it and the area and tried to re-adhere, it sticks but will only last approx 1 day before falling off again. I am very disappointed as it could be a potential safety issue."
5,Great product!,"This is a very well made and secure product, far superior than other brands. I've had it for a couple of months now and it is extremely secure, but I still check it regularly to be sure.I think the issue others have had is installation. The wall must be flat and dry and the tiles clean. Also, these are not made for small tiles- the instructions say a minimum tile size of 6x6 I believe, and the edges must be more than half an inch from the tile edge when installed. Grout lines will interfere with the suction."
1,DON'T BUY THESE DRIVE SUCTION CUP GRIP BARS,One month after the warrantee was up the lever on the suction cup broke. I paid $37.00 for one of these and the replacement part were going to be over $60.00. Go for the Safer-er Grip. Cost is half the price for a better product.
1,A waste of money...,"I'd say these grab bars suck, but they don't. They just fall off. They do not even deserve 1 star, but there is no option to give it nothing."
1,suction cup grab bar comments,"The item looked of good quality but would not adhere to the wall due to the 4"" tile surface. The grout lines were in the way of a solid connection. I did not realize this when buying the item and therefore had to return it."
1,Bent on first apple,"I bought the Rosle fruit corer; it was the largest one. When I got it, it stated on the tag: Pineapple. However, I went ahead and used it to core a Rome apple, and it bent.I don't know if the smaller version is heavier or not.Also, this corer has the tag which says ""Germany,"" but beside it in smaller print and a see-through tag is printed, ""made in China."""
3,NOT made in Germany!,"Amazon's product description says that ""All Rösle products are made in Germany"" and above that, under the item's summary, it reads, ""made in Germany."" This item and many other Rosle products are made in China. Disappointing that Rosle would use the Chinese workforce and charge us as if they are not. More disappointing that Amazon has yet another wrong product description and hasn't changed it after all this time.As to the corer's performance, it works fine. It did get stuck a few times in some pippin apples I did over Christmas (they can be a bit harder than some other apples) and some extra large Romes (not as hard). I mean stuck, as in, trying to take the corer back out. It went through them fine every time though."
5,Humanity remains supreme.,"How to Defend Humane Ideals is a powerful refutation of the amoral concept of nihilism, and shows that even if ethical objectivity is rejected, humane ideals are still supreme over anti-humane rationals, such as that of Nietzche. Flynn introduces the powerful tool of social-science to moral philosophy, and provides a thorough refutation of racism, even in the enlightened form of Jensen's thesis. A seminal work as well as an enjoyable read."
3,Nostalgia,My husband wanted this book. He really wanted colored pics and larger print; we are old. I think maybe a 'coffee table' book would be a good seller. Thank you.
1,Incorrect Book!!!!,This is the wrong book...I ordered the hard capy of Maxwell Street by Ira Berkow...and instead received a pictorial book of Maxwell Street....would appreciate some guidance as to rectifying this so that I can receive the proper ly designated book...Thank you Paul A Keeshin
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"The original content of this book would probably have fit in a few pages. Either the author has a vivid imagination or is simply on an ego trip. Women deserve more substance. The ""women"" presented here have little in common with most of us."
3,Too wordy,"The other goes on and on too much about the process of research and is very repetitive about how her discoveries were so different than the traditional orgasm-centric view of most researchers. Its gets old. I wanted to just hear the stories and I felt frustrated, unable to access the info I wanted and needed. I think the book would have been better with less of the author's narrative about sex research. Too be honest, I can't even finish the book. Maybe when I've adjusted my expectations I will enjoy it more."
4,Well Restored Set of Spaghetti Westerns,"The Sabata Trilogy Collection contains beautiful widescreen prints of each of the films with Italian dialog / subtitle options. While the Sabata films are certainly not the best Spaghetti westerns, they are entertaining and feature strong performances by Lee Van Cleef and Yul Brenner. Director Gianfranco Parolini (aka Frank Kramer) prefers a relaxed pace, so all three movies seem a little slow. He also like acrobats, which adds a ubique touch. This is a great set for the price."
5,When there's nothing on cable.....,"I got this for the times when I can't find anything to watch of cable TV - which, is all to often, I might add. There's just nothing like a good ol'fashion WESTERN - even though it's from Spain or Italy - to make TV worth while again. I recommend this set of movies HIGHLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Sabata Trilogy Review,"As is usually the case, the first dvd in the set was prettygood, but the others were kind of dry. The 2nd one with YulBryner instead of Lee Van Cleef was especially bad. He doesn'thave that ""spaghetti western"" charisma that Lee has."
2,Sabata Trilogy,"I've been wanting to own this set for some time now and I'm sad to say that I was not impressed at all. The DVD quality for all 3 films is good as far as the picture goes but the sound is mediocre. The first Sabata is OK. Adios Sabata may be a little better but The Return of Sabata was just lame. I like Lee Van Cleef so I guess I had high expectations. I didn't care for many of the same characters making repeated appearances as different people. I watched the 3rd installment last night and I was fighting to stay awake! If you can find it cheap, get it just to say you own it. Otherwise avoid."
3,A classic trilogy,This trilogy is a collector's item as far as Italian-made westerns are concerned. The characters are not consistent from film to film but the plots are intricate for westerns. Don't expect too much but have fun just the same.
2,disappointed,should have stopped with the first movie. sequels were a sad excuse for movies. very disappointing for a trilogy. almost like the writers could not come up with new ideas.
4,wonderful baby,"I just want to let you know the joy you have brought to my 2 1/2 year old daughters life with this baby. I can't leave home without it and we're going thorough a little problem because the last one is missing a foot and some stuffing. I havn't been able to find this doll anywhere so I am very thankful to see it here on the internet.Sincerely,Tammy wallace"
2,cute - would be cuter at 1/2 the price,"This is a very cute, soft little doll. I emphasize little - it is not very big. Be forewarned - even though it states that it ""giggles"" - it does not! It SQUEAKS - just like in dog toys. No way does it even remotely resemble a giggle - not by the farthest stretch of the imagination. Plus, it is almost impossible for a baby to squeeze it hard enough to make it squeak. It is a cute little doll for baby's 1st maybe, because it is just the right size for little hands, & it is VERY soft. I expected it to be a bit larger. I was disappointed enough that I returned the item as soon as I received it. I would have had a better opinion of it if it had cost maybe 1/2 of what it does(...)"
4,Great Doll for Baby,"My daughter was 1 year old when we bought her this doll. She loved it!! It's very soft and the head is not too hard. She sleeps with it every night. I've washed it once and it still looks pretty good, however, the neck no longer stays up. I still recommend it"
5,Briana's baby,"My daughter recieved her baby for Christmas when she was 6 months old and ever since then they were together forever. Just recently we lost baby my daughter will be 4 years old next month. I have a satin type baby but she doesnt like it, she wants the plaid fleece type. So if anyone out there who can help me find one I would be so grateful...."
5,A Friend for Life,I bought this doll for my daughter when she was 6 months old. She still has it and sleeps with every night. She is now 5 years old. It has held up through many washings. It has only faded slightly. It's a great friend for any age.
5,Great Read,"Very good book, great characters. Easy to read and love the story line.I have read the first three, and I hope he keeps writing."
5,"Yay, a New Author Discovery!","I downloaded the first ""Buryin' Barry"" book (Dangerous Undertaking) since it was free, then paid for the 2nd and 3rd books. Mark de Castrique is a new name to me, but his plots are nicely twisted and his characters nicely developed. I'm hoping he continues this series since I rather like Barry, the cop-turned-undertaker, and the overall tone of this series."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"The knives I received are NOT the knives that are pictured. Moreover, I bought these knives because they were given a good rating by Cook's Illustrated. However, the knives I received are not the CA4 knives reviewed by CI. And there's more! While the page states that the knives come in a ""Hanging Gift Box"", my knife set did NOT come with such a box. They came in a flimsy plastic tray housed in a thin, cardboard box. Clearly, this is not a ""gift box"" that is meant to be saved. So, I must conclude that this is a bait-and-switch tactic. Don't order these."
1,Handles are cracking at every rivet!,"In 2007 I bought 3 sets of these knives - a total of 12. They still are sharp and most of them look great. However, most of the handles have begun cracking at the rivet points. Some are cracked at every rivet and some are very close to coming apart. These knives have never been abused in any way; never been put in a dishwasher; and have always been hand-washed and dried. I've just contacted Cuisinart and am awaiting instructions to return the knives for replacement."
4,Makes a fun gift.,"While not exactly intellectually stimulating, this is a fun book, one that makes a great gift or stocking stuffer - which is why I purchased it.NOTE: The reviewer is the author of ""Never Be Late Again, 7 Cures for the Punctually Challenged."""
1,"All Titilation, No Substance",This alleged book simply purports to be intersesting but is uniformative while it tries to be humorous and self-efacing. It overflows with smug dialogue which seeks to be humorous.DON't BUY!!!!
3,HELP FUL BUT DISSAPPOINTED A LITTLE,"There was some interesting facts in this book, but the writers were trying to be funny and weren't. I'm glad I read it though. It's a quick read."
5,White Elephant,"I work with a group of individuals who share a superb sense of humor. Gave this book for our white elephant exchange at the holidays. There were quite a few laughs on the title and premise, but later my co-worker admitted how much fun the book was - my sediments exactly! Great coffee table (and better yet bathroom) book."
2,men have nipples because...,"I had high expectations for this book. They weren't met. The two authors had a great ideas but thye couldn't pull it together. It was average. They pick some question which frankly a whole bunch of us have often wondered but simply from embarrassment could never quite muster the guts to ask. But in most of the answers that they provide, they weren't filling or for the most part funny. ANd author (the tv writer/producer) is funny.The book had a few moments where their sens of humor peeks out and in those places, I would laugh and think is that really their hostess' name and did she kreally look and say those things?Cheers,"
3,Bathroom book/Conversation piece,"This book is chalked full of interesting answers to many funny questions, if you need a bathroom book or conversation peice for your coffee table, this is the book for you!"
4,They cover everything,This book really covers every weird freaky question you could ever have about science and your body. They don't waste time with long boring explanations either. They get right to the point. It can be pretty funny at times too. I think that their little conversations that they write between the writer and the doctor are stupid however. They should have just stuck to answering the questions.
1,Hire two editors and call me in the morning...,"This book is so poorly written that it would take an entire team of good editors to breathe life into it. I don't know how some people on this site actually find it an enjoyable read. Most of the answers provided are entirely unsatisfying, and there's actually something smarmy about the book's tone. Indeed, halfway through I wanted to find these guys to tell them to stop being so sickeningly full of themselves. They may be doctors, sure, but they can't write worth crap. As God is my witness, you're better off spending your money on a couple of Starbucks Venti Iced Mochas and just yakking to whomever is seated at the next table. Honestly."
2,What a massive disappointment,"This is the kind of book I love. Short and pithy tidbits of arcane and esoteric knowledge. Except I didn't.This book repeatedly brought to mind Woody Allen's disparaging line about a restaurant, ""The food stinks and the portions are small."" The content wasn't very good, and I can't say I wish there had been more, but wow, were there very few words on these very small pages, and even then, those words were just not very interesting. Smarmy, condescending, dull, irritating, and utterly pointless, the majority of this book left me plodding along in cold silence. Two guys who think very highly of themselves, enjoying the inside jokes and gleeful backslapping of smug teenagers laughing at fart jokes. Whoop-de-friggin-do."
3,A fine idea but not worth the purchase,"It seems to me that taking this out of the library seems appropriate for this book. If you want to use it for entertaining your friends you could buy it, but as a read it seemed a little childish and simple while not being so. They use scientific terminology which most people find a tad complicated, and a one to two paragraph explanation. IF you want to spend your money on this you can, but may I suggest Freakanomics instead, the research in that book is very concentrated and planned out. I will suggest this book for a six or seven year old who will find this more to his taste, an adult would probably not."
3,Men who talk like teenage boys,"I bought this book as a gag wedding luncheon gift for the groom. We were to give gag gifts that told him things about our daughter he may not know. One of her favorite questions is ""Why Do Men Have Nipples?"" The title gave everyone a good laugh. As far as the book, it came up short. It was quite informative but there were too many ""potty"" conversations between the author and doctor, and the use of a very offensive word in one part that had absolutely no reason to be there. All-in-all the book was informative. The questions and answers were informative and sometimes amusing. I would advise everyone not to read the dialogue between the doctor and the author as it in many instances is crude and seems to be more indicative of a conversation between teenage boys than from two professionals."
4,Buy this book and save us docs a little time,"The authors have done a great job writing this book. Being an ER physician myself , I encounter similar questions from patients all the time.'Simplicity' is the word for this book and is a great addition to anyone's collection.I highly recommend it."
5,Questions you asked as a kid.,"This book brings you back to the days when you were impervious to social scrutiny, and could ask these kinds of questions without thinking twice. Leyner answers all the questions you asked your parents as kid, but never got very good answers to. He mixes in a few things you hopefully did not ask as a child as well. An enlightening and very cute book."
1,Poor Value,"The promise of this book is enticing, unfortunately it does not deliver. I can keep my comments brief because I just read many of the 1-star reviews here and they all add up to what I was going to say."
1,Totally lame,"Was this really a best seller? It explains nothing, tries to be funny but doesn't do either. Probably one of the lamest books I ve read"
2,Awful and self serving,"It's a good thing I read this while on a plane. It was only slightly better than reading the product descriptions in the Sky Mall catalog... and just about as informative. The authors talk around many of the self-posed questions, never really providing an answer. The narratives are inane. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting Chaucer but I remember reading ""Why Do Clocks Run Clockwise?"" years ago. That book was funnier and more informative."
4,Funny and informative,"This book is both amusing and informative. A few of the questions weren't really fully answered to my satisfaction, but I did pick up quite a few fun facts. I found the chat intermissions a little annoying at first, but I soon grew used to them and relaxed into the humour break. This book is well worth reading and I will be looking up their other books at some point in the future."
4,Amusing but not very salacious,"I enjoyed this informative book. I think the cover is misleading-- a lot of the questions are not ones anybody would be shy about asking. I also found a lot of the IM transcripts boring and skipped them.This is really an educational book disguised as a bawdy book, which is fine with me!"
3,Good to pass time,"I got this as a gift, and I like it- BUT I would rather get an Uncle John's Bathroom reader. It has more interesting, off the beaten path info. More humor and more intertaining. A lot of this is just common sense...but they put it in a humorous way."
4,it's fun to read..,"This book doesn't take much effort to read. There are questions that the authors pose to each other that never actually get answered in the book, but I found the book a pleasure to read.[...]"
4,It is okay...,"I like the questions that they ask along with the answers, but then the authors get into these little rhetoric sessions and they chat about things that aren't pertinent to the book at all. I could do without those sections."
1,Not worth the cheap paper it's printed on.,"This collection of arcane facts is only occasionally interesting, usually obvious, and is fluffed out by an ongoing nonsensical dialogue between the two authors that is childish, silly, and puerile. In short, it's a waste of reading time."
3,Adults Only!,"As soon as I saw this book advertised, I had to have it. It is certainly funny & informative, but I have to say a little disappointing.I expected the book to be full of the standard Potty Jokes, no disappointment there. But it is also full of needless profanity. The play by play of masturbation was also a bit surprising. I have to wonder if all the questions were even answered, I had to sometimes dig hard into the jokes to find the answers.I had thought this would be a book my whole family could enjoy, but I will not be passing it on to my teenagers & they watch South Park!"
1,Disgusting bathroom humor,"I started reading this book since I have an interest in interesting facts, but I was so turned off from the sexual bathroom humor that I threw it away. Yes, in the trashcan. It isn't a book that I would even pass on to someone else. There are many other books of this genre that are worth reading. I would give this one a pass."
3,Good for cocktail chitchat.,This book contains some interesting medical information most people may not be familiar with. But most of them are not so fascinating. May be useful for conversation at a dull cocktail party.
3,A great little book,This is a great wee book to dip into for a laugh or even for knowledge on absolute trivia. I have placed a copy in the guest bathroom to amuse. Laughter on every page!
2,A Flop,"The fact that I bought this book shows that I had good intentions and good hopes. I was sorely disappointed. The authors try to make themselves swingers and hipsters and whatever. This was a total turnoff.Some of the information was both interesting and informative, but there was too much garbage."
2,Disappointing,"I got this book after seeing one of the authors on The Daily Show and I thought I'd give it a go. Boy was I disapointed. The authors fail to fully answer many of the questions and their attempts at humor made me cringe. They're like people at a party who keep trying to be funny all night and you just want to hit them and walk away. I give it two stars instead of one, because a few of the answers were interesting, but it was much more chore than pleasure to finish this thing."
3,Educational? Entertaining?,"I'm afraid I have to say this book is ultimately neither. I often found the humor to be somewhat ineffective or inappropriate, and the book could have stood to be more informative. I can't think of anyone to recommend this book to, since the comedic aspect was not adequate enough to label the book as highly entertaining, and it would not be good enough for the curious, since the ""answers"" to the questions were usually not enough to satisfy."
3,Cute - but unimpressive,"Overall - I was disappointed. The book was ok to read - but they spend most of their time focused on mediocre juvenile humor. This is so prevalent that it interferes with the interesting medical facts, which are quite limited anyway."
3,Doesn't live up to it's hype,"The book is funny and does teach readers some useless tidbits, but overall I wasn't impressed with the book. Questions I want to ask my doctor after three martinis would be alot more bizarre than the questions asked."
2,So much potential.. .But they blew it,"This book immediately caught my eye. Funny, educational, easy reading. It's exactly the sort of book I put next to the toilet.It turns out the book was somewhat funny, not very educational, and too easy of a read.It was very shallow. Its answers to most of the questions had virtually no depth or detail in explanation. More often than not I finished a question highly disappointed; wanting to know more. The authors barely skimmed the real answers, which is what I imagine people would buy the book for in the first place.The party commentary was almost entertaining and served as a fairly decent segue into the chapters. The IM narration, however, was total filler and went beyond useless. There are questions that the authors pose to each other that never actually get answered in the book.This book doesn't deliver. I was highly let down by it.If you're looking for a good book of ""off-beat"" questions, check out the Imponderables series by David Feldman."
5,funny! and interesting,"This is a really funny book, and a really interesting one. It provides the facts and answers to some of the most unique questions that are enjoyable. If you're looking for a light read, this is a great book. One of the best I've recently read."
1,RIPOFF - NOT WHAT IT CLAIMS TO BE,"Stupid, half-baked answers to interesting questions. The authors are more interested in being comedians than answering the many fascinations questions they pose. Their answers are often a pinch of science smothered by a pound of hokey bull. Some questions don't even get serious science answers, just the two authors goofing off. It's as if comic Jackie Mason were they editor. Apparently the authors don't realize all these questions have been given serious answers by a variety of popular authors, including David Feldman, Charles Panati, and Dr. Joe Schwarz, among others. These three authors, in their series of books, have covered the same ground with expertise first, humor second. Leyner and Goldberg seen to think they've discovered white bread...and hope for second careers in comedy."
4,Funny and informative - a two-hour read.,"This book is co-written by a doctor and a screenwriter who are both clearly frustrated comedians. They tackle about 100 questions that you are just dying to ask your doctor but never would, either because of embarrassment or just not wanting to waste their time. The result is an incredibly quick read that is frequently funny and often informative.That said, don't read this book looking for too much hard science, because you'll only find it in about every other answer they give, but you will learn about the truth or fallacy of a lot of old wives' tales and be able to dazzle your friends with your new-found trivial health knowledge.Recommended for anyone looking for a light read, having even a passing interest in medical/biological topics, or who just likes trivia and humor."
3,Doubly Disappointed,"I was disappointed by both the information and the humor in this book. The information because (a) they often posed a question and didn't answer it and (b) they often gave a superficial ""textbook medical"" answer without thinking about the psychological or cultural sides of the answer. The humor in the answers was often good but the extended ""transcripts"" of their IMs was very self-consciously of the ""aren't-we-clever"" type. Still, I'm sure I'll have a few fun cocktail party conversations as a result of reading it."
5,"Funny, Witty, and Informative","Leyner and Goldberg have done a great job with this text. Yes, doctors really do get asked these questions! Would be a good gift for those who ""have everything"". Nicely done, excellent book."
1,Women Don't Bloat or Retain Water...???,"I really expected to enjoy this book. I am a beauty and lifestyle journalist, but the authors lost me very early. I realize that as recently as 1990, medical schools were still saying that PMS and all of the symptoms are ""emotional trauma associated with the on-set of the menstral cycle,"" but I was disappointed to find this books was still behind the times.I just shut the book after the section on bloating being in ""our mind."" Please!!!Very disappointing, not a way to spend your money, try ""Your Body an Owners Guide."""
3,Why Do Men Have Nipples?,"I noticed that for some of the answersthey tend to ""talk around it"" andnot give the actual answer. They give digustingpotty comments that only a 6 year old boy wouldfind funny. Also, I didn't like that they putconversations from the two of them in the book,the book is supposed to be questions & answersand not pointless conversations.~Skurvy"
3,Lots of un interesting filler,"I loved the questions presented by the book and the interesting answers, but the ""IM"" messages filler seemed to be in the way of the meat of the book. The writers could have answered so many more questions. I enjoyed it, though."
4,Interesting,Although I didn't know them all I did know a few...very interesting great party talk items.
2,Boring and uncouth,"I was very disappointed with this book. ""Why Do Men Have Nipples?"" contains a bunch of random medical questions that most people probably don't know the answers to. However, only a handful of them were interesting to me, and I was also unimpressed by the overall quality of the writing. The authors tried to add humor to their descriptions of various medical symptoms and ailments, but they did so unsuccessfully. The book also contains random pages of dialogue between the two authors which is humorless, pointless, and in some cases extremely vulgar. I think this could have been a much more interesting book if the writers had focused on the quality of the content instead of the mediocre humor, which I found tasteless and almost offensive in places. I want my money back."
1,People have too much time on their hands,This book brings up unusual topics. I already knew most of the answers which are not that impressive. If people rush out to read and rate this I feel sorry for them. They have too much time on their hands. If they went out and did some sort of. act of random kindess then world would be a much better place.
2,Maybe my expectations were too high. . .,"I looked forward to reading this book as soon as I heard it was released. Many of the questions I could identify with, and I looked forward to getting some intelligent dialogue about them. My expectations must have been too high. I read the book and was not impressed. That doesn't mean I didn't laugh a few times, for I certainly did, but I felt the book was lacking. I was hoping for more substance. Most of the content I could have accumulated by running Google searches, and some of the explanations I felt were not convincing. The ongoing ""story"" that takes place between chapters fills quite a bit of space, but it brings nothing of worth to the book. This book didn't impress me."
2,Great Expectations to BIG Disappointment,"The fluff included as dialogue, email correspondence and chapter intros were lame and in poor taste. A few humorous responses to the stated questions, but some were just plain crude. The factual responses were the only strengths."
1,"Ideal for those who are fascinated with ""potty talk"" and ""potty topics"".","For the terminally dumbed down preoccupied with ""potty talk"" and kindergarten humor, this is the book for you! I'm amazed at how many have rated this book highly and enjoyed it."
3,over hyped,"This book is entertaining and educational but I believe overhyped. In total honesty I have not read the whole book yet, but I will."
3,Funny Book,Funny book. Great stuff for parties to talk about or to give as a present to somebody who already has everything.
3,The title's better than the content..,"Even after the third martini, I'd prefer a bit more explanation. The questions are interesting but the answers are too superficial. It's obviously not meant to be a serious study, but couldn't they have added a single sentence giving a concise answer, rather than being just too unremittingly clever?"
2,Padded reviews?,"This is a mildly interesting enough book, but nothing fantastic, and not nearly as clever as the reviews below would lead you to believe. Don't believe the hype below...save yourself the hour that this book takes to read and look up more interesting info online."
3,"Good content, annoying presentation","While the questions and answers provided in this book are entertaining, the overall work is hurt by too many attempts at humor that simply get in the way of our enjoyment.The array of questions is pretty thorough given the book's size, and there are some genuinely funny answers. However, when the authors try too hard at humor, the book suffers. Too many times it seems forced, especially during the sections that are supposed to cover dialogue between the authors. All the talk about their proclivities towards acting like frat boys also grows stale quickly. What saves this book is that the questions they ask are easily relatable, as I'm sure we've all wondered about many of them.Finally, a note about the battle over ""padded"" postings that seems to be raging here. If you look through the first several pages of reviews, you'll notice several from a ""J.Andrews,"" mostly titled ""Good Times."" It does make me wonder about the validity of some of these reviews."
2,Enough with the jokes... stick to the facts!,You can probably get a pretty clear picture of what I had issues with about this book from my title. There is no doubt in my mind that the writers are missing their glory days in college where girls & beer are utmost on their minds. I wish they would just stick to the medical facts & leave the personalities out. I found myself just skipping ahead each time. I just found them unfunny & annoying but the information are interesting.
3,"Funny, but not as informative as I thought.","As a collector of crazy trivia books like these, I was a little disappointed. Most of the questions I already knew the answers to and in all it wasn't that different from many other books on the market today (Cecil's the Straight Dope is better). It also wasn't written as smartly as I expected, and yes it is filled with completely senseless profanity. There were also too many pages about creating the book between the question pages. It bothered me because the book was so short to be filling it up with nonsense. Also, many of the answers were interesting but they were nowhere near long enough (usually just 2-3 sentences) and did not provide as much information as I hoped and craved. However, it is interesting and a fun and educational way to pass the time, although looking the answers up online would be faster, easier, more informative and cheaper."
2,Disgustingly frank,"Have you ever bumped into a person who uses vulgar language freely and speaks in an offensive and overly casual way? That's the tone of this book, combined with unfunny, self-serving attempts at humor. While some of the medical trivia was interesting, completing the book left me hoping that I never have to endure a meeting with the authors."
5,Great Book and Great Title,"With a title like that, I'll guess you'll say you can't resist the book. The book is not naughty although it explains life sciences and concepts in a wonderful way. It's not too thick as well, so it's a great plane-read although you won't want the 70-something perrson sitting next to you looking unapprovingly!"
3,If men read this book they must be gay,"Who cares about men having nipples is Mark Leyner way of being funny. Their are questions about things that people wonder everyday. How do people have sex in wheel chairs, why does sweat stink, can contact lens slip inside a person's head. Does pee stop a jelleyfish sting which it doesn't the book says vinguar."
1,"Interesting, but not that funny.","Yes, it is all those questions one might ask a ""doctor after a few martinis, but it just isn't that entertaining. The book might be more aptly titled ""Talk With A Doctor Recovering From Humor-ectomy."""
1,Where Is My Book,"I've contacted Amazon several times. They promptly took my money, but I never received the book.... It's been over a month now, and still no response from Amazon."
2,Only slightly interesting.,"I know it seems alot of people like this book and that is fine for them. However if you have any form of education or you read books just for enjoyment then you would probably do better going somewhere else. It is like they were doing there best to try and be funny and still informative but did not accomplish either one. I have read several similiar books and the one very real problem that I have with this one is that alot of the questions that they bring up, they do not even answer because they do not know. If you don't know then don't waste my time bringing up the question. This is only my opinion but you may have the same after reading this book."
2,Largely Inane!,"This is not a self-help book or medical manual - just questions asked of a doctor at cocktail parties, presumably after having at least two too many. The best examples include:Does sugar really make kids hyperactive? No.Is sperm nutritious? Not particularly.Can poppy seeds make you test positive for heroin? Yes, depending on the test.Does marijuana help glaucoma? No more than available medications, plus it requires copious amounts - about 10-12 joints/day.An example of literature we've done quite well without up to this point, and could well do without in the future."
2,"GOOD IDEA, POORLY WRITTEN","The subject and theme, to ask a physican embarrasing medical questions at a coctail party has tremendous potential and could have produced several succesfull volumes....the authors really blew it. The lackluster copy and the very dull description of the party is filler material which wastes the reader's time. These sections would have been better served with blank pages. No one will purchase volume two, if the authors dare to publish one. It is a shame that the book does not cover more Q and A which is what the readers really want."
2,Not worth the money.,"The concept is great. But the book is trying so hard to be funny it forgets to actually answer the questions. Very few questions are actually answered in this thin little book. For example, can you lose a contact lens in your eye? Still have no idea. I believe the answer was ""no, it has nowhere to go"". Well, that doesn't really help now, does it? Clearly they were trying too hard to be funny that they forgot to actually spend time working on answers to the questions. Don't waste your time."
2,Not worth the buy....,"I actually bought this book and ended up reselling it to someone else. Sure, this book provides answers to a lot of those questions half of us would never think of asking. But then again, to some questions their basic answer is ""Well, that's just how it is sometimes"" and don't really provide an answer to the question. To other questions where they do actually provide an answer, they use these huge words which only say ""look at me, I'm at a doctor...see how smart i am!"" this book is good as one of those books you flip through while standing around in the book store, but not to actually buy b/c it's not a book a person would generally pick up for light reading over and over."
2,annoying,"Yet another one of those ""wacky questions with sober, scientific answers""-type books. This one's a little different because it concerns mainly medical questions concerning the human body, especially those dealing with waste and the privates.This one, though, is left of the median: about 20% of the book is an annoying dialogue between the two authors, largely about what strategy they should employ in writing the book. This was completely uninteresting and marred the book. In fact, far fewer questions were answered than could have been since so much space was taken up with this drivel."
2,I expected more,"I really just expected more. The questions weren't very exciting, and I knew the answers to many of the questions on my own. The answers given were also usually incredibly complicated with little to no explanation.The really annoying thing was that the authors threw in lots of little bits of meaningless conversation they shared while writing the book.Overall it was a waste of my time and money."
2,"All padding, no substance.","I just listened to this on audiobook and was very disappointed. For some reason (most likely to pad the tiny amount of actual information) they felt the need to couch the whole book in a ridiculous and lame cocktail party scenario. It was obviously intended to be funny but was just pathetic. Many questions had the answer of ""gee, even doctors don't know that."" Wow, thanks! Also, some were so obvious I don't know why they were included (does anyone really NOT know that poppy seeds cause a positive test for opiates because opium comes from poppies? Really?) If you love entertaining bits of info, read ""Freakonomics"" instead."
3,"It can make you laugh, but is it really worth the money?","This a book filled with plenty of trivial information, some none of us had ever wandered about. Indeed, I was curious to learn about the effects of coffee on human growth (there are none by the way), but truthfully, I could have gone without the data on bodily functions and human waste. My advice is, if you are looking for a book to discuss over dinner with your friends and friends, skip this one. Frankly, I wouldn't even bring it up at the bar and if that's the case, then why read it at all when you can just go to the net directly for answers to common questions?-Simon Cleveland"
2,"Starts Good, but then turns to potty humor","The first chapter is good and sounds like a doctor wrote it, but then it turns to weird ""chats"" and potty humor. I am sorry I finished this book."
1,Waste of time and $,"This book is like a comedy movie that only has enough humor to make a preview. You go to the movie thinking it's going to be a riot, but the only funny parts were those in the preview. Why do men have nipples? It's an intriguing question and makes you think you're going to learn all sorts of trivia and interesting facts about human anatomy. WARNING: If you made a C or better in biology there's nothing earth shattering in this book. If you ever took a human anatomy class, you could've written this book. I got the CD to entertain me on a road trip. It was a big fat waste of time and money."
1,not woth the $,The book looked intereseting but when read you find a lot of gibberish with the authors and not that many facts. Flipped through it in one short spurt and don't want it any more.
2,Bathroom Humor. Next Time Print Your Material In The Stall With A Marker.,It's not a bad book if you enjoy middle school bathroom humor....about half the book is sexual humor. And for about 25% of the questions they dont know the answer.Takes about an hour to read.
1,Nothing like another book giving people the incorrect information........,"This book is exactly what our society does NOT need....a collection of questionable medical information. There were several sections that had me wondering about the veracity of the information. When I got to the sections on MSG and sugar substitutes, I knew there was reason to question the information in this text. Millions of migraine suffers are proof enough that MSG and sugar subs such as Aspartame cause debilitating migraines. I'd question the knowledge of any M.D. who isn't aware of this well documented information. And BTW....only a male M.D. would say size doesn't count....the vast female population would say otherwise and no man can make this determination since his experience is insufficient to judge. Heaven save us from men who don't have a clue."
2,disappointing application of an excellent premise,"Many of us have, at one time or another,wondered about some of the questions answered in this book, so I was looking forward to finding the answers. Alas, the weak attempts at humor, along with the overly familiar, chatty style and pointless insertions of IM conversations, all come together to undermine what could have been one of my favorite quickie reads.Pick it up for the answers - some of which only come after a lot of beating around the bush - but don't come at it with high expectations."
2,What?,"I was so terribly disappointed in this book. As previous reviewers have indicated, it does almost nothing that it claims. It scarcely answers five or six questions and it answers them briefly and without much thought.Most answers are ""we don't know"" or ""it just is"". If you have an inquisitive mind and an interest in medicine or biology, this book ain't for you. If you like poop chat and boring IM transcripts, run to the bookstore because you will LOVE this book.Bummer! I was really hoping to love it :("
3,Ok book,"I enjoy this book, it does have some interesting facts in it, however not as much as I thought it would; also the answers don't go into too much detail, I think I would like it better if they did."
1,but there's a catch...,Why does your mom have a **** would be the more pertinent question dear sir. books like this make me question the future of pop litterature.
3,Hilarious,"The type of humor in this book is evidenced by the title. If you are the kind of person that will buy something quirky just because it caught your attention (as I am) you will not be disappointed with ""Why Do Men Have Nipples?""There really is nothing better for me that truly intelligent, sincerely deviant, side splitting comedy. Okay, so only certain parts were side splitting... the rest were only funny. You'll enjoy the book, and if they come out with a second edition, perhaps they'll address ""home remedies"" or ""wives tales"" about internal injuries due to uncontrollable laughing!"
2,brilliant title that lacks content,"The title of the book is brilliant. The concept of the book has potential. However, the content does not live up to the hype. The authors try to be funny, adding explicitives here and there, with some locker room humor interspersed. For the questions that do have serious answers, they are loaded with medical jargons and names that go into one ear and out the other for the laymen readers. Of the hundreds of questions/answers, there is probably only a handful that are interesting trivia. I recommend just to borrow the book from the library for a very light reading."
2,the title was the funniest part of the book!,"I was so disappointed with this book. The title would indicate some kind of funny questions and answers, but not only was it not particularly funny, but the conversation the authors had with each other throughout the book was pointless. It was as if they added conversations to make the book long enough. They missed the humor, so I was hoping for some great answers to some of the questions, but there were few. They either got too technical (medical jargon) or ended up with answers that just touched on the issue--lacking enough explanation or rather lacking an INTERESTING explanation. Disappointing..."
3,Fairly Entertaining,I've always thought Mark Leyner writes hilarious stuff...and some of this is pretty funny...but it gets a bit tedious at times. I enjoyed the witty IM conversations between the authors. No huge revelations here; I think most of us are pretty well aware of the makings of snot...but it was an okay read.
4,Entertainment all the way!,"This book is very witty and for the most part enjoyable to read, except for the inevitable gross parts."
3,Great show but poorly mastered,"I love House, but I was expecting better image quality from Blu-ray. It only looks marginally better than what I could get from iTunes."
5,This is the Best Season Yet!!,"My husband and I have been very into this show since it began, but stopped watching it on TV, so that we could anticipate getting the seasons! This season is the most rivetting yet! We have been watching 2-3 episodes every night it is so good! I would definitely reccommend this season to anyone! :)"
4,Turning Point,"We have ourselves a Turning Point. Now, we have to wait to see how many ""twists"" are about to arrive; which could rotate us back to the beginning, or could put us onto a new road altogether."
2,Not the same House,"To be honest, I am only on disc 3. So far, I do not care for this season of House. I like the hardened, harsh-but-accurate character of House. This new softer version bores me. I did not enjoy the episode revolving around Cuddy. The show is dynamic because of House with his wise-cracking, not whether or not Cuddy has a boyfriend or a sick baby. And, why on earth was there such a sweet wedding between Chase and Cameron at the end of Season 5 only to have the marriage break up so soon? (On a frivolous note, I also dislike the new hairstyle of Dr. Chase.)No, I am not generally an all-around-negative person. (I know you're thinking that I am.) I loved all of the other seasons prior to this one and own all of the DVDs. I will definitely finish watching Season 6. Hope House returns to his former self soon."
1,Still haven't uploaded the complete episode,I called to notify Amazon about this episode of House being only 12 minutes of the 44 minute episode. The customer support rep told me they were aware of the problem and were working on encoding a new video - this was over 5 hours ago. So... are you going to fix your video or just let people keep buying 12 minutes of the eposide?
2,House: The Complete Sixth Season,"The sixth season of House starts off good and ends on an interesting note, but past that, the injection of new blood appears to show the patient not fully accepting the diagnosis. Laurie still brings his ""A"" game and the cast wants to match the effort, but they're still hampered by the way the episodes lay themselves out on screen. Worth watching for the opening and closing episodes but past that, newbies should start with an earlier season to get oriented."
5,A powerhouse,"Okay, i haven't read the other reviews prior to posting this, so perhaps the ""powerhouse"" label has been used already.This is the season with the famous two-hour episode (episode 1 actually). Wow! The rest is good too."
3,A little less 'Housey',"This season of House is unique in that House is in therapy and grows a conscious. Somehow it works, even though his very ""Houseness"" is gone. There are a few episodes where he falls back into his old ways, which makes the season inconsistent, but all-in-all the same diagnostic medical mysteries are presented and solved, so it's the same old show. It's better than a couple of the other more recent seasons, but it still falls short of seasons one and two, when the show was original and edgy. Cameron leaves the show early in the season, which is disappointing, but 13 returns, as does Talb unfortunately. The season is a little bit too nice and centred around friendship and love, which are neither motive for watching this comedy series. I'm happy I bought the series however, and I will be watching it again, just not too soon."
5,Thank you Amazon!,I was so disappointed when I was able to only watch half of this episode on YouTube! I looked everywhere for it! Thank you AMAZON! You made my night! I was finally able to finish the episode I was unable to see!!
5,WARNING!!,"Pre-ordering highly anticipated DVD's can be harmful to your financial health. With the current price matching between retailers and e-tailers the price is likely to drop drastically a few days after release. Case in point: ""Mad Men"" season 3, pre-odered by me from Amazon for $28.99 had dropped to $17.99 in a price match with Target before my DVD's had even arrived."
1,will never order from this seller again,"i was contacted by seller and promised he would send another (don't know where the first one that was ordered and charged to my credit card on 12/2 went), gave me another tracking number and fell out of site again. rest assured i will not be paying for this due to my credit card privilege. please do not never order from this seller, who is really not a seller when the merchandise never gets to you. i have learned from my mistake an will make sure no one makes the same one. not true to promises. false promises. i have still not been satisfied and they have my money, for now, but not for long."
1,House,I have not received this product yet. I have emailed and have not received a reply either. What is the problem here?
3,Blu Ray features,"If you like House you'll enjoy the sixth season. But is it better than the standard DVD edition? I say NO. I hate waiting for the Blu Ray to load every time I turn it on. It has to go through the preveiws each time. There is no chapter selection on the episodes. You can't resume wear you last left off. You can only add a bookmark which is easy to forget to do.It does have some other unique features like the U-Control which adds pop up messages relavent to the scene you are viewing. Also, the clarity is better than standard DVD. But the HD master audio isn't thereBottom line I would save a little money and get the Standard DVD. I like being able to press stop turn off my player and it automatically resumes when I hit play again. Blu Ray doesn't do that. I love Blu Ray in general, it's just not worth the extra price in this instance."
5,I LOVE HOUSE!,I think this is the best season so far other than season 7 right now on TV. I just love Hugh Laurie!!!
3,No option to purchase the whole season. What's up Amazon?,"It is bizarre that you can buy the full season for House seasons 1 - 5 and season 7, but you cannot buy season 6. You can only purchase each episode individually which is inconvenient and more expensive. Why the inconsistency?"
4,Christmas present,This item was ordered for holiday gift. I was pleased with the prompt order processing and acurate shipment date. AND the package arrived in great condition.Ordering was easy and am pleased with the vendor's custonmer service.Thank you.
1,Two Damaged DVDs. Seller did not stand behind product. UNEXCEPTABLE.,"Bought this season of House months ago but did not get to watch it right away. When I did, disc 3 was badly scratched, disc 4 was digitally damaged and had something crusty on it. Also, the case was cracked. I was unhappy. Emailed seller, never replied. Tried again through amazon, finally got a reply. Seller was rude and accused me of doing damage to the DVDs. Refused to replace and choose not to stand behind his product. I would be cautious when buying from this seller... Other than that, if your into medical stuff I would definitely recommend watching House! Great series!!"
5,House Rocks !,"What is there to say, the shows staying power speaks for its self. I am not so fond of the way it ended, but it will always be a favorite in our home."
5,INTENSE!,"Unconquerable and shameless, House is a man who embraces his unrestrained and most often offending behavior as fearlessly as he fights for his patents, friends, his lovers, his work. A man of truth, he will match wits with and challenge the most dangerous and powerful whoever in his life. This series should not be missed."
2,"Havarti is great, but avoid the 'lite' stuff",'A creamy cheese with a semisoft texture that contains small holes. Havarti is Danish in origin and has a mild flavor that sharpens with age. It is popular as a dessert cheese served with fruit and wine'
5,"Kenzie doll, of the Mystery Squad dolls","I see this doll can't be bought on the net or in stores, But you may be abel to find it at doll showes, flea markets, antic shops etc, Well any way, I just want to say, this is a great doll. The dog is cute. and you can solve mystries with this doll. if not, Only it's best to bread each section of doll hair, cause it's very frizzy. I recamend this doll for adult collecters, or older childern."
5,Mystery Squad Kenzie,"This doll is lovely, from her hair down to her shoes. What amazed me most about this doll is her face and hair. Her face is beautiful and delicate looking. she has few blonde streaks throughout her hair. Even though you can't comb her hair, I just love the spiral curl look. She is posable at her neck, elbow, twist and turn waste and knees are bendable. She also comes wearing a black choker around her neck, a mid-drift like jacket, a sleeveless mid-drift top, a denim looking skirt, knee high socks, platform white shoes. She also has painted on white undies LoL, plus other accessories are included. I rated her 3 stars on educational because I really don't think she has any educational value. She will probably be a doll your daughter might enjoy for a short period of time but end up thrown and forgotten in a toy chest. Since I collect dolls I found her to be a great addition to my collection since I did buy her on ebay as a ""face repaint""."
4,loved it!,i love this doll!! her gear is super cool. her dog is adorable. my favorite part of kenzie was her emormous afro! it is just so big and curly and it just sticks out all over the place! just dont brush it. i just can go on all day about her hair. it is just so original from the other straight haired dolls. there should be more dolls with big afros like that! i love afros! so thats why i love this doll.
4,more than is there,"this is a bizarre film that has everything: soft lighted romantic scenes to violent scenes and gothic to giallo suspense. It is a good film to have on DVD because it is not entirely successful, and i like it better the more I watch it. It is important to realize what is really going on in this film is a contrasting of the neurotic aristocratic sexuality of the Rouvignier with the young freelove people they have chosen to surround themselves. There are several bridge characters who only make sense if you understand this contrast: the maid, ""Giovanna"",""Flo"", Rassimov's character. The Rouvigniers have desires for the shallow young people who surround them and ultimately that will drive them mad. Is the movie successful at communicating this? At first watching, the answer is no. However, after several viewings, I believe that it does capture what it would be like to lecture on Edgar Allen Poe to a group of hippies."
5,Very Educational,"""Mastering Audio"" by Bob Katz was very informative. Bob helped me to have a better understanding of (1) exactly what I was trying to accomplish in the ""mastering"" process and (2) the mastering (and mixing) errors that tend to ruin otherwise good recordings. It is my opinion that Bob Katz has done a remarkable job writing in such a way that people of all skill levels can still learn something useful."
2,Very Disappointed,"The book is a random core-dump of Bob Katz's audio engineering knowledge, but it is completely lacking any organization that would facilitate an effective learning process for the reader. Two major aspects of the book are very poor. First, it is completely lacking a quality introduction and chapter sequencing that would promote knowledge transfer. Second,it is very deep in technical jargon and very thin on learning points. I have read a lot of material in pursuit of developing a better understanding of mixing and mastering, this would rank near the bottom from a learning perspective. I will give it one high mark...it is ""glitzy"" and professional looking."
3,great resource,"I keep this book by my desk for easy reference, especially when I'm looking for another way to process music. sometimes, when a piece is starting to sound stale, this book offers ideas to add another dimension to it. It was worth the money."
5,A Masterful Book on Mastering from The Master,"Up until now, I've read books by authors who fall into one of the following categories: 1) musicians 2) traditional, primarily analog audio engineers 3) acoustic scientists or 4) audio computer applications specialists. Getting meaningful information from one of these authors requires my own extrapolation into the remaining areas--or at least taking the authors comments in those areas with a grain of salt. FINALLY I have in my hands a book written by someone who can put it all together into a meaningful whole. The book is a wonderful blend of descriptions of how things work that will take you to the next level along with some very valuable common sense advice-like how to effectively sequence songs into an album. I'll keep this book in my studio and refer back to it again and again. Probably the best (but also the most honest) thing I can say about the book is that I know I will sound better because of having read it."
4,Stay away from it if you are looking for hard-and-fast rules,"I bought this book after reading many good reviews. After reading it, I would say that it is indeed a very interesting book, there are a lot of ""obscure areas"" that the author dares to tackle, with a remarkable ""scientific"" approach.BUT, before you buy this book...It's not a ""funny"" reading, you should get this book if you are already familiar with all the technical subjects covered, the author seems to assume a certain previous knowledge, otherwise you won't go past chapter 1. AND, for all of you cookbook lovers, forget it, you are not bound to find those here.That being said, I have it, and I like it. I'll probably re read it sometime in the future."
4,"very worthwhile read, but a bit overly audiophyle for many","For those of us who cannot afford tens of thousands to invest in accurate monitoring and quality hardware and the best DAW's with the best software, it's a bit much in the uber-audiophyle direction. On the other hand, just getting this much technical explanation of how sound works in the recording and mastering paradigm from a very experienced voice made this book very worthwhile reading for me.An antedote to the high-end audiophyle intimidation aspect was ""The Art of Mixing"" by David Gibson, which i read immediately following and enjoyed on a much more ""let's roll up our sleeves and get it done with whatever's at hand"" level. I think the books make good companions to each other."
4,Bob knows,"a few words would be enough to get the idea i guess....it's not telling you what to do, it tells how to do through many possible ways.."
1,Pumpous and useles,"40% of the time, the author brags about his expertise. And never offeres good advise. Completely useless. What a waste."
5,Best little toy!!!!!,I bought this for a 2 year old last christmas 2003 and he still plays with it. The batteries last amazingly long. He loves to change the colors and shine it directly in my face. Definitely buy this toy if ur toddler likes lights.
4,Grand-pa proof,"Bought this for my aging father who has dementia. He likes to use a flashlight at night, but has taken apart and broken four in the last couple of months. I had a flash of brilliance and bought him this one. You need a phillips screwdriver to access the bulb and battery. This one will not only be child-proof, but grandpa-proof..."
3,My two year old likes it !,"My two year old son is into flashlights and colors,but the only colors it has is red and green. I wish there were a few more colors becasue he has really learned from this when we turn it on a color we ask what color is that and he will tell us. I just think it should have a few more colors."
3,Fun for about a day!,"I picked this up for my 24 month old and at first she thought it was great, but her interest level waned after the first day. It's now sitting in the bottom of her toy bin and she doesn't even pick it up anymore. I imagine that it might be a bit more fun if she had a specific use for it and/or if she was a bit older."
3,Not impressed,"I got this for my 3 year old daughter thinking it would be the perfect toy: a flashlight that turns itself off! And yes it does do that. But it takes large ""C"" batteries, and the light output (for a C battery) is very very dim! And the batteries are going dead sooner than I expected! Apparently the timer mechanism itself uses a lot of juice. So all in all, this dim flashlight that you can't even see unless the room is pitch dark is quite the disappointment for me and my little girl. If it was brighter, and if the batteries lasted longer, I would give it a higher score. It looks cool but it doesn't deliver."
1,disappointed,"after reading other reviews, i can see i am not the only one who had problems with this flashlight. our light went out on it's own after about 30 seconds..very frustrating. however, after 2 yrs, it's still working...or not working."
5,not a battery hog!,"We purchased this on Amazon for our than 2.5 year old son. At 3.5...a whole year later, he still likes playing with it. It has held up to a very active little boys rough play, with its durable plastic and large buttons. It doesn't hog batteries like some flashlights. It goes out after awhile, rather than burn the night away inside your child's covers AFTER they have fallen asleep. It has a fun nob that creates 2 extra colors to play with. It is bright enough to really USE in the dark. The model we have is not the white one, it is bright yellow. This is a really nice little flashlight for kids. Recommended!"
1,Piece of junk. Worked for 5 minutes then died,"Nice idea, especially the automatic shutoff.Ours worked for 5 minutes of fun, then died. No way to get at the bulb or anything to check it. Pretty disappointing gift."
3,Nice but,"I'm assuming this is Flora's bestselling record,cause when I put ""Flora Purim"" in the amazon search engine,this comes first on the list & when I looked up Flora's top selling mp3s,there were a lot of songs from this collection,as well as the slightly overrated Butterfly Dreams album in the top 20. Now don't get me wrong,there are some nice gems on here,but it really doesn't compare to the essential and frankly more exciting Flora albums like:EncounterOpen Your Eyes You Can FlyThat's What She Said500 Miles HighSo get those first.And do yourself a favor,take the time & listen to the WHOLE albums instead of just downloading a song or two."
2,Misinformation,"This product was not made in the USA, it was made in China. Considering that, the price seemed a little steep."
1,NOT MADE IN USA - It's Chinese!,"It says on the site Made in USA but when I just received it: Made in China. I'm so angry with Rosle and Amazon.Please get some Made in USA, or any the *&%$ where else (besides China) goods!"
1,We were hoping for a 15 year garlic press... we got 15 weeks...,"We spent over 50 euros on this, hoping that this will last a lifetime. In the beginning it was amazing. Then over time, through pressing, the press which connects to the hinge rivet became wider, and thus the whole press becomes looser, meaning that when you press, the two pieces comprising the press become separated, and thus useless. Any alternative recommendations?"
5,Best Garlic Press Ever!,Excellent machine! We used it the first time and there was no complaint at all about HER garlic press.We've finally found the one that works every time. We highly recommend the Rosle Garlic Press.
5,Great reviews are accurate! Worth the money.,"This garlic press is worth the money. I am a skeptic when it comes to expensive things being worth it, but the numerous favorable reviews enticed me to try this garlic press and I am glad I did. It's really not necessary to peel the cloves (or toes, as we call them in Louisiana), and the press is easy to clean.Spend the extra money to get this one, and cut out a couple of restaurant lunches to make up the difference.You won't regret it!"
2,Broke within 2 months!,"This product is BEAUTIFUL and well-designed. Unfortunately, the cool tension feature that keeps the handles closed broke within 3 uses. Then, less than 2 months later, the whole thing just snapped and bent into a completely unusable shape while routinely pressing garlic! I'm so so disappointed!! I have contacted Amazon customer support and will see how they respond to this issue. I read p curran's review before I purchased but thought that he/she was in the minority and just been sent a lemon. Apparently, they make plenty of lemons to go around! I hope your experience is better but be prepared for disappointment and frustration."
1,I cannot believe this is such trash,"While i do own several rosle pieces in my kitchen, this is not constructed like anything else that i own. on the first piece of garlic that i tried to press, the unit simply was destroyed. the spot-weld at the fulcrum snapped off, causing everything to misalign and bend beyond repair. if you order this, good luck, as this is a manufacturing problem from the factory and is probably going to happen to you as well."
3,"good product, but it's not made in the USA","It's what I expected, but it says ""Made in China"" on it. The Amazon description of features is wrong. The description says ""Made in USA"". I was disappointed, since I thought they might have started making them here. I hope they have better quality control than most other products made there."
2,Depressing,"What a disappointment, this was supposed to be the best garlic-press available, yet upon pressing just the second clove of garlic it bent, slightly yes, but now the snap-close feature no longer works so when it is hung on a hook it falls open. If it cost $10-$15 I would probably keep it as it does do a great job of pressing garlic and it is easy to clean but at $35 I expect it to be prefect. So I am returning it. It is truly a shame as if they just made it with slightly thicker steel it probably would be the finest press available. Depressing."
2,Holy Grail (but not the Roesle),"Been chopping & grating garlic for 50 years because garlic presses were always a pain but still kept searching. Finally bought yet another one because of its provenance and styling : The Roesle came apart at the weld after a few presses . So much for curb appeal. Then saw the review of the KUN RIKON in Cooks' Magazine and bought it -- a revelation. Superb in handling, output, residual, and cleaning."
4,Rösle 12782 Garlic Press,Satisfied with the gadget. It does its job. I rated 4 because the worksmanship is not up to the brand name. Anyway this is good and good to the eyes.
4,Mine's a dud,"Unfortunately, I must have received a dud. I agree that it's VERY easy to clean. But, as far as easy to press, mine just isn't. Sometimes I have to put one handle on the counter and push the other handle with both hands. Now, I have small hands and that may have something to do with it. I guess I need a really sharp garlic press if anyone knows of one. Other than that, it's a very high quality product. Maybe I'll wrap it up and give it as a gift to someone with larger hands."
5,By far the best garlic press in the world!,"This garlic press is made in Heaven! No, really! I have arthritis in my hands and couldn't use the old standard garlic press anymore without significant pain. With this press all I have to do is toss a few cloves inside, squeeze gently and the built-in design of the press does the rest. No peeling required, but sometimes I peel anyway so there's less waste. Besides being so completely simple to use it has the added bonus of being able to completely eliminate all traces of garlic smell from your hands. Just swish it all over your hands while rinsing under water and voila! no more garlic smell on your skin!"
1,Rösle 12782 Garlic Press,Just be aware that it is made in not made in the USA. It is made in China. I was specifically looking that is made in the USA.
3,Great til it Broke,"My daughter raved about the Rosle Garlic Press. And the reviews were equally outstanding. Unfortunately, while pressing the 4th garlic clove, the press flew apart. I sent it back requesting a replacement. The reviews were so good that I had discarded the original packaging which Amazon had requested that I use to return the product. So, good luck and good pressing. I'm willing to give it another try based on my initial good experience and the reviews of others."
2,Good lookin' but not for cookin',"This garlic press looks stunning, just like the rest of the Rösle line. I love the shiny finish and the hooks on each tool.However, don't judge this book by its cover. I am very disappointed with how this tool works. It smashes up the garlic and much of it gets stuck inside the press creating a lot of waste. It is also difficult to clean, requiring a lot of rinsing to get all that stuck garlic out.This is the first time I have been disappointed by Rösle. Too bad."
2,Misrepresented,"I already own the Rosle garlic press, but mine was not made in China and is substantially higher quality and the mechanism is very smooth. I did not read the reviews as your product info stated that the press was made in the USA. I have been disappointed that most stores,even Williams Sonoma, are carrying the press made in China. I just got my order - which was to be a gift for my sister- and the press is NOT made in the USA. You need to change the description on your site ASAP. This is really false advertising and very deceptive. Many people are trying to purchase products made in the USA or at least not made in China. I would not have ordered this garlic press had I known it was made in China. I wish I would have spent more time checking out the other reviews. I can see that this deceptive behavior is not new. Reviews go way back. Not good business."
1,I was fooled by amazon! It's made in CHINA! OTL...,I was fooled by amazon! It's made in CHINA! OTL... I expected it made in German. The price is steep.
2,Mediocre,"I try to buy top-notch kitchen products. The Rosle is overpriced, holds only a small clove of garlic, is NOT easy to squeeze, and is ""German design"" but made in China.The Oxco press that I already owned does a better job and was much less expensiveI sent it back. Bless Amazon for their easy return policy."
5,Garlic Press,I regularly buy this for gifts.It is counter levered and easy to operate.I would recommend it for any serious cook.
4,garlic press,"Looked everywhere for a good garlic press and was impressed when I found the Rosle on Amazon...the item was pricey but I was willing to pay for quality.....the item was shipped quickly...I thought this item was made in the U.S.A. but to my horror found a sticker on the press stating ""made in china""...what a disappointment as I try to support American workers......would not have purchased this product if the seller had divulged country of origin"
5,Rosle Garlic Press,"This is absolutely the best garlic press available on the market and worth every penny. Great design, heft and feel. Easy to use and clean...others don't come close. After I purchased it I found I already had Rosle's can opener....also a great product."
5,The best garlic press ever,"This thing works like no other. It is built like a tank. Some presses have a bigger hopper, but I don't care. It is so easy to clean, the little plastic tool is not required."
5,Loved it,After all these years they still have the magic. A couple of new songs that makes the purchase worth while.
5,Mmmm...good !,"Sade is so lovely, and this concert was so nice. Obviously much-rehearsed, because it was flawless. I loved the huge on-stage screen backdrop and how it was used - in one number she appeared in different windows and doorways, really cool.I especially enjoyed the short film extra that's included - little time clips from before, during, and after the concert, but jumbled in time sequence.The sound quality and HD was immersive and felt like I was there. If you have only even heard one song of Sade's and like it, you will enjoy the whole concert."
3,Good singer,Good vouce. Not a great voice but good enough for the subject. I bought this after hearing one song from her. I wasn't dissappointed.
3,SADE,"Sultry as ever and musically you cant fault it. At times it becomes a bit monotonous, so probably better as something in the background whilst entertaining rather than watching it from go to whoa."
5,She's REALLY BACK!!!,Saw this concert on tv. Had to own it. Sade is back after a 10 year layoff and better than ever!!! What a performance.I only wish I could have been there personally. But in my town we're lucky to get one of the Pips. Just imagine Ladies and gentlemen we present THE PIP. This ain't South Florida. Soooooo we buy lots of concert DVD's and watch you enjoy yourselves AT the concert. I won't see Sade unless her bus breaks down. Concert on I95.
5,sade dvd concert live.,Hi! love this dvd concert live from sade very good well done didn't get the chance to see her in concert this is a great way to see the concert and good for entertainment for your guest and the family.
5,State of the Art Production,"Let me say that I have been a Sade fan since the beginning so this review is not about her music per se. I also have her previous Sade Lovers Live DVD.What separates this from most of the recent concert DVD's is the Blu-Ray but mostly the choreography and production values. Remember that Blu-Ray offers better sound and picture and this is where the lighting, photography and staging makes it stand out compared to many of the others out today. Sade fans will rejoice and those of us who weren't as fortunate to attend the show this time will have a wonderful souvenir of what is a great concert experience. By the way, the recent concert Blu-Ray that is comparable in production values and the type of show is George Michael's recent Blu-Ray from London. You might check it out if you are a fan.With a good sound system you may find that owning a BluRay might be almost as good as being there."
4,good stuff,"enjoyed the video, good quality........the stage and show effects were good, the production was very good..........maybe someday we can get to see her show fo'real...........but so be it."
2,Very disappointed with video and sound.,"I had high expectations for this BluRay but it let me down. The concert itself is pretty boring and the audio/video quality is average. Cameras are switching very fast to the point where it gets really annoying. Audio was a big disappointment (tried DTS-ES HD and Stereo PCM) when compared to most of the new concerts on BluRay. As much as I like Sade, I can't recommend this concert on BluRay."
1,bad quality product,I have many blue-ray concerts and this product is very disappointing in quality of sound and video. Video quaility is around 2 and sound quality is 1. I really like Sade and had high hopes for this concert. Was very disappointed.
2,Waste of Money,"The production level is so low that I can go to a local Jazz Lunge and get more kick.The band looks like they failed to practice.Sade's voice was never the flagship feature of SADE, but with the fading skill level of the band, SADE is down.I have owned many SADE's CD and DVD.But, the curtain has closed."
5,WOW WOW WEST!,"The last time I watched a Sade concert was in 1985, taped from a TV broadcast.With Bring Me Home, I was floored from beginning till the end. Sade has upped the ante and it shows. The stage set is simple and yet absolutely stunning. There are moments where the stage is covered with a translucent curtain affording a mysterious peek a boo game with the audience. In one number, a pillar rises from the stage with Sade on it. Breathtaking. Sade also dances in this show, a surprise for me, considering the laid back tempo of her music.Sade still wears her hair pulled back into a ponytail. She looks amazing, like she hasn't aged a bit.For the set, Sade performs 22 of their best known hits and some material from Soldier Of Love. From the 80s (Your Love Is King, The Sweetest Taboo) to 90s (Kiss Of Life, No Ordinary Love), 00s (By Your Side, King Of Sorrow) and post 00s (Soldier Of Love, Skin)Bring Me Home is an absolute scorcher and is everything a concert should be."
5,Great CD and DVD,"I sort of liked Sade before I saw this concert video on Cable. I liked it so much, I went out and bought the CD/DVD combo."
5,Great dvd,Sade what more to say....Audio was phenomonal if you have the right stuff..Why do I have to write so many words for this review?
4,ABSOLUTELY!,"If you like SADE. Then ""ABSOLUTELY"" purchase this this product. I saw her ""solider of love"" concert, both were great - this product and her concert!"
5,"Sade - the Best, as Always","Loved her 2011 tour, saw her twice. The DVD is great with a lot of fun backstage footage.To the Three Seconds Guys: You are AWESOME!!!"
4,still a big talent and looker,"Sade's fans are quite enthusiastic and loyal and friends saw this concert tour in 2011. Overall quite entertaining and tight. Her hits are fun. there is a bit of sameness to her songs and performance so two hours can get you sleepy. But she is great to watch, over 50 years old I believe. She is one of the good ones. I didn't got to the concert in Charlotte because the ticket prices were sky high Las Vegas style. too much."
4,"It's good, but.......","Whenever Sade opens her mouth to sing, Gold pours out. Bring Me Home-Live is no different. BUT! Nothing in my mind will ever replace her early career songs, like my favorite- ""The War of Hearts"". Mrs. Adu is the queen of strong, lush, sometimes ""haunting"" musical arrangements and singing barefoot too :> It works and sells, don't change that classic sound. It's a signature of pure greatness, unlike no other!"
3,Just okay for me,I found this just okay. I expected better audio and video quality. The previous DVD's are much better. But if you are a SADE fan you will still love this DVD...great to see and hear her so many years later....
5,Sade,"I have always love Sade, and this is a great concert of her work. I listen to it everyday!!! I wish I could have seen her live."
1,Sade bring me home dvd/blue ray,The video didn't not have the blue ray quality that I see on other Sade dvds I have. Very dissatisfied
2,Additional DVD in WalMart version,"I hate when they do this. If you want the blu ray, you cant get the the excluisive WalMart disc unless you buy the DVD version. This is why I take every chance to get everything I can for free - record companies are dirty marketing tricksters."
1,worst bluray and most boring ever bought!,"have thousands of cds and hundreds of concert dvds...this is by far the most boring concert dvd EVER. saw her a few years ago at the Bowl; wasn't impressed; bought this based on the reviews...my fave song; nothing can come between us is a one minute snippet of her band, not her... songs go no where; like listening to cds in the dark!what a waste! would give it a ""0"" if an option!"
3,Not quite up to par with the rest of Rosle's products,"I own this Rosle zester, and like many of its other Rosle relatives which are in my possession, it comes in a sophisticated and beautiful looking, stainless steel.However, I didn't find this quite up to par with the other Rosle products. I found the zester to be quite dull, forcing me to really dig into the fruit to obtain usable pieces. And even upon such digging, I was unable to produce long strips of zest, unlike other zesters which I have used. So now, I simply use my microplane grater instead as a substitute.Save yourself some money, and skip this dull zester."
1,"Another Made in China, NOT in Germany","I ordered the wisk and this at the same time. I assume the item may have been made in Germany at one time. It is now made in China by a German company. It looked sturdy, but in my experience Chinese Stainless is not as it should be, and will rust (why does there seem to be a different standard of quality?). The item was heavy and seemed like it is usable. Give it a try if you want, but when Amazon states it is German made, I expect it to be that. I have returned this too. Also, Why are three pictured in this photo rather than the one you receive? That is a little deceptive too. It is NOT a set of 3."
3,On Shaky Ground: to the point,"I have been trying to find infnormation on the New Madrid Quakes for some time and this particular book while not lengthy, was sufficiently detailed to provide information I was not already familiar with. At the same time, and of course due to the dates during which the quakes occurred, there was, and is, limited factual evidence to rely on."
1,Completely Vacuous Book,"This is a waffly book that will not tell you anything useful about web services. It is padded out with banal advice such as ""Althought the standards don't require it, you should try to use meaningful names for you web services."" But as to a description about the weird use of name spaces in WSDL -- forget about it.Nothing is described usefully even at an overview level. The author tries to get away with vague definitions of terms, one by one. I suspect that the author does not know how to build a simple web service himself.This book is not useful to a beginner. It is not useful to anyone. I wasted my money."
3,A Mixed Bag- No Smoking Guns Here,"Good delivers up some tempting morsels in a book that attempts to cover the government angle of the UFO controversy. The American Defense Intelligence Agency chapter is excellent, and so is the CIA and Iron Curtain countries coverage.Unfortunately, some of the other stuff seems composed of hearsay and wishful thinking: the NASA/Apollo sections in particular seem to be more suited to a made for TV movie than a serious discussion of government secrecy or disinformation activities. The Majestic 12 papers (the Rosewell ""crash"")in the appendix were pretty much proven to be fraudulent (traced to an Air Force intelligence operatrive's typewriter) even at the time this book was published.While I would recommend this book to the reader, I also recommend taking the contents with a grain of salt."
5,Very Interesting!,"Above Top Secret is an interesting, scary read. Do not read it alone at night or you will jump at every little noise! Everyone should read this book to be informed."
1,"Not just bad, comically bad.","If you remember the ""Blackhawk"" comics where the fighter squadron was made up of Olaf the Swede, Hendrik the German, Stanislaus the Pole, Andre the Frenchman, Chop-Chop the Chineese, each a caricature of the most overblown stereotype of his nationality, then you already know the cast of this book. A major letdown for anyone who enjoyed the author's novels set in the Far East. I can only assume that Clavell had attained enough power as an author to ignore his editors with impunity."
3,Service,"My order was shipped within the timeframe, but the seller should have been more informative regarding the status of the order rather than me having to constantly trying to fine out the status myself."
1,"I tried, I really did try!","I LOVED reading Shogun and Noble House, great books, everyone should read them, it should be mandatory reading for all high school students. So only for my love of Clavell did I try to read Whirlwind twice, yes twice. And the sad part is I am thinking about trying to read it again, I miss reading Clavell. Its ether Whirlwind or read Tai-Pan a 2nd time or Shogun or Noble House a 3rd time."
3,A fine continuation,"Who said the ""asian saga"" had to be set in the far east? Iran certainly qualifies as part of the Asian continent! My only regret with this novel is only after reading the first 500 pages did I notice that I had Vol. 1! The search for Vol. 2 will commence!"
2,"late for this review, but....","I've read everything James Clavell wrote. In fact, it is the only series I've set aside to read again. All books, except Whirlwind were good to fabulous. Whirlwind was an major effort, taking 3 attempts to slog through it, and only because it was the last to read. Between the unusual names, multiple plots (some going nowhere), and the length it just wasn't worth it comparable to the others."
3,Whirlwind,"This is not the greatest book written by Clavell The story occurs during the recentish revolution in Iran. The family now has financial interests in Iran and one family member has a relationship with an Irani woman. Good story, but jumping the shark in this series about the Taipan and his heirs."
2,Bleh. Just bleh.,"You probably came into Clavell's opus late, reading them in chronological order as opposed to published order. You've found Whirlwind tough to find, unlike all the others. There's a reason for that. Whirlwind isn't set in Japan or China, and the characters and families we grew to love (and in some cases, hate), aren't the protagonists here. Hence, it sold nowhere near the number of paperbacks as the previous books. Check eBay, a bazillion HC's that nobody bids on, and no PB's.My advice? Let it go after Noble House. Yes that's disappointing, but nowhere near as disappointing as reading this book. Of course the most disappointing thing of all is that James didn't live long enough to write about the turnover of Hong Kong to Mainland China."
2,Dissapointing,"I have owned many Barrons books over the years, and they have all been excellent. However this one certainly misses the mark. It has three practice tests that are all more difficult than the actual ACT. The English section is essentially useless to prepare for the ACT because the questions do not correspond to the general style of questions used on the actual test. I was expecting alot more this book for $35, and it fails to deliver. For only $20, I would highly recommend ""The Real ACT Prep Guide,"" a book published by the company that makes the ACT that will provide practice exams that are closer to the actual ACT."
4,the difference that makes the difference,"an excellent set of essays that map out derrida's project and a lucid introduction to deconstruction, including the celebrated critique on foucault's 'madness and civilization'. not as involving as 'of grammatology' but certainly worth more than his critics make him out to be."
4,Down to the details,"Just like the title of this book says, understanding audio is what this author is all about. I recently became an intern at a studio and really wanted to know every aspect of a modern studio. This book more than helped me actually learn the details of what I love. I only recommend it for someone who wants to spend the time to really get to know their trade."
1,"You won't understand ""audio"" better than before buying this book","A textbook for students of no direction.The author dips into everything possible in the subject of audio production ,in a schematic, superficial, lightweight, naive and easy way that the reader is left without real information, motivation ,inspiration ormeans of accomplishing anything - being sound design and manipulation or music creation and production.In fact it's a feel-good book written for those ignorant or already knowing a bit, provided they are not interested in learning anything more.The title appears deceptive (actually it is much more enticing than the author's credentials).Do you remember those ""look busy"" screensavers of the old days?They made you look to others as if you were doing something very serious and difficult while doing really nothing; well, leave this book open in your DAW desk : it's the printed equivalent."
5,Well worth a look,"drbob says:I perceive Sakkas' review as pretty harsh. While it may be true this is not a book for experienced, accomplished recording engineers, it's the best introductory work I've encountered. I liked the book's organization and the author's writing style. For those of us who are non-experts, this book is well worth the price, imho."
2,Beginner's Handbook,"This is a broad and basic take on not only recording, but electronics and associated equipment as well. But if you've been around the block a few times you'll find you have to search for anything you're not already familiar with. I only spent about a half an hour flipping through the pages before I decided it just wasn't going to open any new doors for me."
4,intense Read,"I just want to say that this is a great concentration of essays, and Conrads writings, both pro and against Joseph Conrad. If you are not ready to sit down and delve into the mystery and multiple connotations his writings have to offer, then don't purchase this book, it takes time, patience and most of all a desire to understand. His novels have been viewed racist, apocalyptic, humanistic, sympathetic or even as a visual tool of his time. Enjoy!"
1,Who says this is low carbohydrate?,"While this is a pretty book with tempting pictures, the recipes are just not low carbohydrate. Just a short thumb through the recpies shows the following carb counts **per serving**: 66 grams: Winter Casserole Soup and Grilled Cinnamon Oranges, 47 grams: Cheese and Roasted Red-Pepper Stuffed Endive with Bran Cereal, and the list goes on. To be fair, there are some recipes with carb counts in the teens and twenties, but that is even too high for a person with high carbohydrate sensitivity. A second problem is that the recipes are way too fancy for every-day cooking. These are not staple-type recipes, but instead recipes for the gourmet cook wannabe. I'm sure there's a place for this cookbook, but I wish I hadn't purchased it myself, as FOR ME it was a waste of money."
2,Does not work with the Protein Power Regimen...,"Buyers beware!! Although the Protein Power regimen is referred to on the back of the book and in the introduction, the carb counts of the recipies in the book are almost all too high for the Protein Power dieter. As a matter of fact, over 2/3 of the recipies have too many carbs. Although the recipies are mostly quite tasty, many are quite complicated or expensive for everyday cooking. This book will mostly appeal to someone who is looking only to slightly reduce their carb intake but not actually follow the Protein Power diet."
2,Not so good for VERY low carbers,"While the recipes in Ms. Gassenheimer's book look wonderful and the layout and photos are terrific, this is one book that has made it out of my house to the resellers because the carb counts for most of her recipes are too high for those of us with very low carb diets. If you are doing Atkins, most of her recipes will be beyond your scope. One benefit of her book though is that she also focuses on keeping it lowfat while doing low carb. But buyer beware if you are on ultra low carb because the book won't do much for you!"
1,Review helps reviewer!,"The online reviews helped me determine if this is the right cookbook for me. There are many variations of a low-carb diet and you have to determine which one is right for you. This book is helpful for those who are not on a totally restricted carb diet while it is of no help to a person who wants to keep their carb intake to a low 10 or 20 grams. For the reviewer that suggested substituting low fat ingredients for some of the recipes ""he has missed the boat completely"". This book adds variety - but only for the person who is moderately reducing their carb intake. For the person who is on a ""very low"" carb restricted diet such as Atkins or Protein Power, this is not a cookbook for you."
3,Average at best,"I wasn't very impressed with this book and some of the recipes in it are pretty bad. I found much better recipes in the book Eat This! I think it's better than nothing but honestly it is not a book that blows you away. I have had great success on low carb dieting so this is not a review of the diet, just the book."
2,How Low Can You Go? Lower than THIS!,"As a Type 2 diabetic who can only maintain any control over my blood sugars and weight through a strict low-carb regime, I had high hopes for this book. I hoped that it would provide me with inspirations for meals that would make low-carb life more palatable, and for meals that I could share with my non-diabetic husband.WHOOPS! These recipes are NOT what I call low-carb. I would gain weight steadily if I ate from the plans in this book. I found one recipe with 46 grams of carbs per serving!Unless you are someone who currently lives mostly on bread, cereals, fruit, soda, and desserts, this book will *not* help you reduce carbs more than a little. Shy away from it and read anything by Atkins.What I recommend if you're a diabetic is Richard Bernstein's wonderful book, *Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution*. I am sure that following the principles he outlines is adding years to my life - not to mention the ten pounds it has, initially, removed from my body!"
4,Great Plan - Carbs a Bit High,"I purchased this book to get me on the right and tasty path of low carb. I loved how the book has all-in-one meal recipes and the 14-day sample menu. I did notice that the carbs seem to be rather high for someone who is pursuing the very low carb weight loss ""induction"" period like myself and I am a bit disappointed that I cannot yet try some of the yummy-sounding recipes in the back two sections of the book."
1,Very disappointing,"I don't believe she gets it. Low fat this, low fat that! This is supposed to be a low carb book. Most of the recipes are way over the carb limit that most low carbers can have. Most meals add up to more than I can have for the entire day, sometimes several days! Not worth the money!"
4,More than a cookbook...,"First of all, I am not on a carbohydrate restricted diet so I found all the info on how to mainatain a low carb diet to be a waste of space (although very informative). I bought this book because I wanted quick, tasty recipes with a nutritional breakdown and I figured that making some low-carb dishes couldn't hurt. I'm extremely pleased with the recipes and the book delivers what it promises...meals in minutes. Everything so far has been delicious. I only wish there were more recipes. One caveat - if you are on a carb restricted diet and you flip thorugh the recipes you will see that a number of them contain pasta. Don't be fooled! The pasta serving is miniscule!"
2,Don't like the recipes too much,"I found a lot of the recipes unappealing or even nauseating, though I really liked the structure of the book, ranging from no-carb to healthy carbs. And I found the focus on low fat kind of annoying -- if youre going to bring that into it then you should focus on good vs bad (omega 3 vs 6) fats, or just leave it out!"
1,There are better books out their.,Don't waste your time. Unless you like planning your menu well in advance. There are better books out there. This book has ideas that 95% of normal people would not waste there time on. I know I didn't.
1,Not REALLY low carb,Lots of good recipies. Many main course dishes are low carb but most don't follow TRUE low carb like Adkins etc. If you want that buy another cookbook. If you want a low carb way of life this is probably the book.
1,Diabetic,"I recently learned that I have diabetes. A dietition has recommended that I watch my carbohydrates and it is hard to find any food's in recipe books that I can fix hat will curb my appetite and hunger pangs. I get weak and shakey and have to have something sweet to help overcome this. I know I am just starting a diet, and it will take time for me to get adjusted can you help? thank You Betty Ownbey"
2,Not Low Fat though,"IF you are serious about weight loss this book is not going to help. Many of the recipes are over 40% fat. Sure there are ways around it like using fat-free mayo instead of mayo made with soybean or olive-oil. But who wants to re-do a recipe. Also many of the protiens are used are too much protien for a healthy diet, Pacific Rim Pork was listed at 71% protien.Save your money and modify your own recipes."
4,FAST EASY AND TASTY,low carb meals in minutes I especially like the size and weight of the book and the grocery lists GREAT.
1,"For carb intolerance, this is NOT the right book","For those who are carb intolerant, and whose lives may depend on being on low-carb diets, this is NOT a low-carb cookbook. Carb intolerant? Note the pasta in the cover photo.I donated this book to Goodwill, found others that are better (PROTEIN POWER LIFEPLAN, Dana Carpender's books, Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution, Gary Taubes GOOD CALORIES, BAD CLORIES, among others) and have lost nearly 50 pounds since late Oct. 2010."
3,Not my favorite,"The book is okay. It would probably work fine for someone on the Southbeach, rather than the Atkins diet. It does give full menus at three stages of weightloss, but some of them are too complicated for my busy lifestyle. It depends on what your definition of ""in minutes"" is. I was hoping for meals that would take between 15 and 25 minutes, no such luck."
2,Disappointing From Start to Finish,"I starting trying low carb living for my husband and I since we both wanted to eat leaner. This book was a total disappointment to me. The recipes may only take minutes, but they are made of ingredients that I don't stock and can't even find in the grocery store. Also, overall the recipes are rather unappetizing to me. I recommend flipping through this book in an actual store before buying, so you can decide for yourself whether you would make these types of recipes. So far I haven't even used my book."
5,Perfect for baby and young children,"Sherri Huffman has a very soothing (and good) voice. The musical accompaniment is soothing. As they get older, the kids will enjoy the lyrics to the songs. Highly recommended."
1,"Si quiere votar su dinero, comprelo!","La peor compra que he hecho en mi vida. Solo 123 paginas en letra grande.Este libro no contiene nada de informacion. Me siento robada por el autor. Y, me enoja muchisimo haber perdido mi dinero en esta porqueria de libro.Gracias"
4,Me gusto el libro...I liked the book,El Libro me gusta much. Las entrepetaciones son claras y facil de entender. Ah y facil encontrar lo que estas buscando. I really like the book. It provides clear interpretations and very easy to locate the subject needed.
4,I like it!,"This year I bought my dad one of these ""Dad's Garden"" signs. I know it's not father's day but I was so phyched that just had togive it to him earlier! I had it wrapped and sent to his house But I made sure that I was the one to get the mail instead of him. I said"" Dad this your father's day present I now it it is early but what the hell"" He took one look at it and he fell in love with it. Now when he gives us a tour of HIS garden we can tell that everyone knows it's his.Thanks"
2,One of my favorite plasure-reading books...,I really enjoyed reading this spectacularly written book.
5,The Tiger is Dissolution,"Evola's almost reckless advice is for very wise people who have a strong sense of proportion; it is not for weak minded people who want to exhibit power or force. In a nutshell, we are born in modernity, crouched on the back of the Tiger. For Evola modernity is decadence, atomism, mass beliefs, urban myths, propaganda topics, consumerism, social conformity and social fear, essentially fear. This reality faces us with a dilema: or we choose with gallantry individual self-realization and personal growth through Perennial Tradition disciplines made available to us through modern media ( a paradox of our times ) or we dissolve ourselves in an illusory World whose lack of substance and cinicism we wilfully choose not to bother ourselves with."
4,Great weekend reading.,"""Men Without Women"" by Ernest Hemingway features a glimpse into the genius that is Hemingway. I found it to be a great read during a summer weekend. I especially enjoyed the Nick Adams stories and the story about the matador fighting one last glorious bullfight (one of Hemingway's favoright subjects). ""Men Without Women"" deals with subjects both everyday and serious such as love and abortion. This short read by Hemingway makes a great introduction for anyone wanting to begin reading Hemingway. I highly recomend it."
3,"Ok, But Not for Me","This is just a personal opinion.I have not read much Hemingway and I hope to read more of him. This collection of short stories just wasn't for me.His characters are tough guys, and he goes into detailed descriptions about bullfighting and boxing..I am not a fan of bullfighting nor boxing, or do I know a lot about it. I had to look up a lot of bullfighting terms in the dictionary, I guess it's good to know but again, I didn't really care for it.This was a not a good start to Hemingway for me, but I didn't hate it, it was just OK."
3,Early Hemingway,I have been revisiting Hemingway and reading some of his earlier writings which I hadn't read before. So far I am not impressed. Thank goodness his writing matured and evolved over the years - which is true of many writers.
2,Book Without Goodness,"The stories in this book leave the reader with no doubt that they are reading Hemingway, but the collection is rather unremarkable. Typical Hemingway strengths, including strong and descriptive writing of places and things, are present. But I found the stories themselves to be weak."
5,Looks fun,I do not have this doll. I will get it very soon. I will love it. I can not belive that Chatta lights up!!!! I have the flora singer doll. I have Stella doll and a musa doll and same Stella doll.
4,older flora doll,"hi,i'm that person who said she looks like the bloom doll.i got the original flora doll for my birthday and LOVE her!she's a good friend to my other winx club dolls and barbie dolls and also finds my bratz yasmin doll fun to hang out with(i'm talking about the flora doll,of course.if it was flora,and not the doll,she'd be on the bratz cartoon)she is one of my favorite winx club girls and is just soooo pretty!and also,buy this doll for your child,you won't be sorry!girls 4 to 13 will love her!PS.im a bratz lover,barbie lover,my scene fan,and also a HUGE fan of sonic the hedgehog!i worship sonic!sonic,will you marry me?"
2,Holbrooke's Facade of Brokering Peace,"Holbrooke's next book about his failed efforts at peace brokering should be called ""To Start a War""."
2,Detailed but biased,"The added value of ""To end a war"" is its very detailed description of the Dayton negotiations from one of the main players. However, the book takes a very biased view of the causes of the conflict in the Balkans, what perpetuated them and what brought them to an end. Holbroke presents the simplistic view that he, together with US military force, ended the war.He mentions nothing of previous peace initiatives. Holbroke does not acknowledge the US role in the Croatian government reconquest and subsequent ethnic cleansing of the Krajina region (populated by ethnic Serbs) in Croatia, one of the main factors in the chain of events leading to the Dayton negotiations."
2,Did We End a War?,"The fighting in Bosnia has stopped. But it is too soon to tell whether a war was won.Only when U.S. Forces leave and the peace holds can we say that the Dayton Peace Accord was a success. Judging by recent events in Kosovo, America is being signed on to a long term stay in the Balkans with no end in sight."
4,Jack Ryan in Ohio,"I have just read Holbrook's insightful and interesting account of the Dayton peace accord. Though I must agree with some of the amazon reviews that his book is selfserving (he clearly hails the people who will be able to offer him the ""State""). His portrayal of this troublesome peace accord is presented almost as a product of his ""brilliant"" and ""intuitive"" achievements that without his personal involvement wouldn't have taken place. Clearly there must be alternative sides to Holbrook's account of events. But with that in mind one must also admirer Holbrooke for his talent as a seductive storyteller of very high quality."
1,"Full of errors, buggy and no longer supported","I am an after-school teacher looking for software to evaluate where my students are. Well, I took the test and realized that there were typos. It had partial questions that you couldn't answer the question for.On top of that, when I tried to print, it gave me additional errors.I tried loading the software on another computer too and it wouldn't even load. As soon as I discovered these problems, I looked for customer support which is non-existent. I've asked the merchant for a refund."
2,"Good test, bad software","My son has taken the 6th grade full and some strand tests. There is no built in help for each problem. Also, there isn't a report for parents showing exactly which answers were incorrect. The actual tests he has taken have been decent, so far. However, the promises made by the software are seriously lacking."
4,Offshore Sailing: 200 Essential tips,"I recommend this book to all novices and many experienced offshore sailors to prepare for the unexpected problems that you need to address or avoid especially when you are so exposed to the extremes of nature, and completely disconnected from any immediate help. Lots of good lessons learned and references.Chris C."
4,Concise and well worthwhile.,"Having read most of the larger tomes on offshore sailing and passagemaking, I wondered what this author could offer to add to the knowledge base. While some of his tips are not quite unique, they all are presented in a clear and concise manner which makes it easy to decide which tips are of value to you and your boat. My only regret is that the book is monohull-centric, without any tips specific to cruising catamarans. Nevertheless, most of his suggestions are universal to cruising boats, including coastal cruisers, and I've added many of them to the ongoing upgrade list for my Leopard 42. This is a easily carried reference book that I will share when I crew on a friend's boat for an upcoming Pacific crossing."
5,Off Shore Preperation Bible,"I've been a boater all of my life, a sailor for the last 20 years, boat owner for 15 years, racer for the last 7 years and I'm ready to take my boat off shore to do the Newport to Bermuda race. For a costal racer there is a tremendious amount of boat preperation and this book has been my most helpful resource, lot's of great thought staters and direct solutions you can apply immediately without spending huge money. There answeres to questions I hadn't thought of yet and it was an entertaining quick read. I'm reading it for the 2nd time now and then will pass it among crew. I feel confident that you will agree that Bill Seiffert has been there and done that and can keep it from happening to you. Must have for any do it yourself sailor looking to prepare for an open water passage."
1,I do not recommend this book,"Yes, there is a lot of valuable info there. Yes, author is one of those ultra smart skippers.The book was written in horible style of humor. It was hard to read. All noobs and starters, even boat ovners are great topic to make a laugh. Everybody is dummy except author. I found it abusive. I definately woun`t sail with him and will have to push myself to finish this book.Sorry, but that`s the truth."
5,Fun Live Action Disney,"Well, in the hit and miss world of Disney live action DVD releases, it looks like we lucked out on this one. The ever so king of physical comedy, Dick Van Dyke, is presented here in this delightful comedy in its original aspect ratio of 1.75:1. As one viewer stated, buying Disney live action DVD's is like rolling dice. Looks like we have a winner on this one. Van Dyke scores a hit with his performance along with a delightful support cast of quality actors; Edward G. Robinson, Dorothy Provine, Jack Elam, Henry Silva and Slim Pickens along with several recognizable character actors.This DVD one not to be missed. But keep boycotting the ""Black Bearded"" releases and reward Disney when they bow to the wishes of the consumer."
4,Funny little movie,"We watched this movie years ago via VHS rental, with our children. As they became adults, we discussed old movies we had seen and decided to start searching for them on DVD to rewatch.Dick Van Dyke is a two bit actor who gets mistaken for a hit man/gangster. When he realizes the only way to survive is to act the part and play along, he finds himself in all kinds of trouble. Good acting and great characters.Our family has adopted some quotes from the movie: ""Stop that bleeding, it's stupid"", ""the punk got nervous and pulled a shiv on me"" and ""You want me to make him dead?"".Great movie and great memories. Definitely a classic."
4,Fun Movie,The movie was very fun. This movie was obviously aimed at a younger audience but it was entertaining for all ages. It is a little silly but that is what you would expect. It is a good wholesome family movie!
2,Not too bad,"There are funny moments definitely, but the plot moves slowly and predictably. The first time you watch it, though, it's fine."
3,"cute, but a little bit of a snooze","hey, dick van dyke is a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but this movie is quite a cliche'd story. a bit too sleepy"
5,Loved this item,The Dept 56 Love is a Baby Boy Snowbaby reminds me of my own son and how he loves his blue blankie! I wanted to have a keepsake that I could glance at and remind me of this stage in his life. I will treasure this Snowbaby for a lifetime!
5,Great insight into World War II,"While this is Churchill's fourth book on the happenings of World War II, it is not a book about Churchill, but rather his thinking and interactions with the leaders of the Allied Powers. Here you will discover all kinds of little thought about problems that Churchill dealt with such as the Gandhi-inspired peace movement in India. I highly recommend the whole series. My only quibble as I stated in another review is the level of proof-reading. It looks like the e-book was optically scanned from a printed book and there are some jarring ""typos"" that should have been picked up by proofreading. In all fairness, there are fewer errors in this book than ""The Grand Alliance"" and ""Their Finest Hour""."
3,Triumph and Tragedy,I had hoped that this book would help me to understand W W II; it did to a certain extent but I often got bogged down at what seemed to be dull reading.
4,Good reading,The 2nd longest e-book I ever read. Enjoyed reading about the end of World War II from Churchill's perspective and the meetings of the BIg Three and trying to end the war.
1,Made in China NOT Germany,"With all of the lead in products from China, it was very important to us to make sure that our food cookware was not made in China.The product description clearly stated ""Made in Germany"".The product arrived with a label stating ""Made in China"".We returned the product and Amazon was very good about quickly providing a full refund (and pre-paid postage to return the item)."
4,a real good product,"This is one of the best tenderizers I have ever owned, good balance, easy to use, very effective on any kind of meat. I also like the total stainless steel constuction; easy to clean and dishwasher safe.I haven't had it very long but already it has seen much use without any problems and I expect this to continue."
3,Olaf learns to read and gets into mischief along the way,"As Olaf learns to read he puts his mother's letter in the basket for litter. He obeys the word Pull on the fire alarm and can not quite make out the Quiet sign in the library. As Olaf learns to read, he takes his elders on quite a few adventures. In the end Olaf proudly brings home 2 books instead of one, since he is a good reader, and is quite happy to be initiated into the world of reading. This is definately a kid of an earlier time but he still gets into enough mischief to be apealing to some youngsers today."
1,Why I Would Never Buy This Book,"After watching the first 20 minutes of E! on the Red Carpet/Golden Globes and hearing the unbelievably TASTELESS questions Isaac Mizrahi asked several actresses, I would NEVER buy anything he is associated with. He is definitely low-class; in fact, I would say that a Pleistocene bottom-feeder sits higher on the scale than this man."
5,Not a Thing Wrong With it...,No complaints other than the shipping. Waited six weeks then contacted AMAZON and a replacement was sent and received in a week. I'm so impressed with this peppermill that I am also orering the saltmill.
1,I must have gotten a bad one!,I found this Pepper Mill a really bad piece of crappolla. Cannot understand it after all these great reviews- maybe a I just got a lemon. Whatever- the grind was always changing- almost nothing to extremely course- and we had to fill it very often. Sent it back as a bad one and Amazon was good enough to refund my money. I got a T handle one that also reviewed well- we shall see if it is any better!
5,great product!,"I concur with the other comments - this is a great product. It looks great, feels great, does a great job (smoothly and evenly) grinding course and fine peppercorns, and is very easy to clean (Vic Firth has an online video on how to easily disassemble and clean the mill, if needed). We have only owned it for 2 months, and it is nothing but great!"
4,Its Nice,"The pepper mill is very well built and sturdy,I hope this on lasts longer than most as I use them a lot.so far so good, I Really like the Grind adjustment,its very easy to use."
5,"""Would you like some fresh ground pepper with that""?","Made in USA by VIc Firth [...], best known for producing a wide range of high quality wooden drumsticks and percussion mallets.Has an adjustable grind setting, feels solid and good in the hands.A great gift for the American drummer in your life."
2,Works well but poor finish,"It seems to work fine grinding pepper but for the price I would have expected a much nicer finish. It showed up scratched and even the ""Vic Firth"" logo was smeared from their cheap, spray on finish."
5,"Beautiful, yes, but more importantly...","Sometimes, particularly when the heart is heavy, using this book to pray the psalms is particularly useful and fruitful, because there are no distractions. The caligraphy is clear and seems to truly help to focus on each psalm, narrowing it to each line, then to each word...sometimes one ends up marvelling at the stroke of the pen which created the word, but that too becomes part of the prayer - part of the WONDER of prayer. It's a genuinely excellent prayerbook, and it also makes a wonderful gift for a person of faith."
2,"Lovely, but disappointing","I hope that I just got a terribly fouled up book or all the previous reviewers haven't even cracked their books before writing a review. The book itself is a piece of art, that is a given, and I will cherish it as far as that goes. My major problem is that once you get to Psalm 58 it goes haywire with the psalm not even being finished and all of a sudden psalm 43 and the end of 42 is being reprinted on the other side. It continues like this for quite a ways throughout the rest of the book and even some of the psalms are not even present like psalm 63, which was very disappointing. There is also no musical notation so one can know how to sing or chant the song either. So for a practical usage standpoint it's not very user friendly."
5,a lovely wedding gift...,"I only wish that we could have another edition, this one smaller and lighter."
3,Nice but...,"It is a very good concept and it seems to work ok but for me, the zipper scratched my babies chin so it was always red...it disappeared once we stopped using it so maybe it was just us. the swaddle feature did work well but the zipper issue was too much for us to handle."
1,Fleece Swaddle is way too hot,"This is the second halo swaddle we purchased. The other one we have is a light cotton material. I purchased this one hoping it would be a little warmer. Unfortunately, it is SO thick that my baby wakes up sweating even when she is just wearing a diaper underneath. I wish I had known this prior to purchasing because I will not use it again, but use the cotton one instead."
3,"Just an OK swaddle, Miracle Blanket better.","We got this and a another type of swaddle blanket at our baby shower. After using both types for a few weeks now we have found this one is OK but nothing special. Baby can wiggle out without too much difficulty, no matter how careful I am to wrap him. The other swaddle blanket (Miracle Blanket) is MUCH better. I suppose if you have a baby that isn't very strong or doesn't move around much this would be fine."
4,Can't live without this,"I really needed a swaddled but also wanted something warm. This is the perfect combo. It's cozy and swaddled really well. We love it! I just wish the fleece didn't pill, but we use it everyday so I guess it's to be expected."
5,love this!!!,"I ordered this fleece sleep sack for my baby girl because the room she shares with us is the coldest room in the house and it does a wonderful job of keeping her warm. I love the halo sleep sacks!!! I have been recommending them to all of my mom friends, they are awesome."
5,A must-have,"This has been a staple in our nursery. In his first 3-4 months, our little one slept best when swaddled. The built-in swaddle feature made night-time changes and feeds so much easier. Swaddling while your half-asleep doesn't sound hard, but I appreciated the ease of this feature. As he got bigger and we transitioned out of swaddling, we were able to keep one-armed tucked in which made the change much easier for him...and us. I would highly recommend this to any parents."
5,Love These!,These sleepsacks are the best out there. They wash and wear well and are so comfy cozy!!
4,Simple and soothing,"This is certainly an easy answer to the swaddle/blanket/warmth dilemma. Our son is a Houdini-Baby who escapes from all swaddles except the Miracle Blanket, but he hasn't gotten out of this yet. It's super easy to use, too. I like that the zipper goes from top to bottom so the tab is away from his chin, and that we'll be able to take the swaddle off and use it as a simple sleep sack once he's outgrown being swaddled."
5,Great for those who have difficulty swaddling !,Excellent way to securely swaddle your baby and keep him or her warm without blankets in the crib.
1,baby is all sweaty,"after two nights sleeping with this swaddle my baby got a rash from sweat. its not hot at our home (70F) but baby was all wet in this swaddle. it is very comfortable,but the fabric-deffinately not baby friendly!!! not gonna use it."
1,Wouldn't recommend,"We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old thinking it would be easier to use than a traditional swaddle blanket. He really enjoyed it when we first tried it out. It is nice that you can make it tight and they can't wiggle out of it like the regular blankets. The problem we found the first night of use was that it can slide up. My son sleeps with his head elevated and this blanket just slid right up over his face. Thank goodness he was still sleeping in our room and we caught it quickly because it was wrapped very well around his head. Threw the thing out immediately. Great concept, didn't work for us."
4,Good but missing one important feature,I love the Sleep sacs by Halo. My daughter lives in them. i feel safe with her in them. The only feature i thought this one had was the Velcro arm holes. The one we received from the Hospital had that feature and we love it! But unfortunately this one did not. So we do struggle to get her arms through the arm holes and it can be annoying. Besides that i would recommend this product.
4,Cozy Sleeper,"Once growing out of a swaddling blanket, we've used Halo sleepsacks to help our little one sleep. This fleece version is great for winter to help keep babies warm. Our baby is 9mo and around 18lbs and still fits and loves this thing. If she's fussing when going down, she is able to wiggle her arms free, but it generally does the trick if she goes down tired. Nice feature about this style is the removable swaddle wrap. Once the kid no longer needs to have their arms wrapped, you can graduate them to just the sleepsack."
5,Worked great for our baby...,"This sleepsack worked much better for our baby than the various types of swaddle blankets. It is sometimes a little harder to get her arms through the sleeve holes without waking her that it would be with a swaddle blanket, but the benefit is that it is easier to change a diaper (since it zips up the front) and the sleepsack stays in place and doesn't ride up around the baby's face. Also, the velcro pads are very large so you can adjust where to attach it on the sleepsack and make the swaddle varying degrees of tightness.My only complaint is that the microfleece is pretty heavy, so I was worried that our baby would overheat at night. Overall a great product."
5,Extremely pleased,"We are very happy with the quality of the sleepsack. I had purchased one 3 yrs ago and while it was great for my baby, I found it cumbersome to use and in the laundry it was always coming apart. They have since modified the design to be easier to use and of much higher quality. We have to wash ours often and I'm very happy with how it is wearing. I close the velcro enclosures before washing so it doesn't stick to everything else in the load. My only complaint is that it seems oddly sized. my baby is big but very short for her age and it seems as though she's growing out of the length before anything else. I am very pleased with the high quality construction of this swaddle and plan on buying the next size up. I would highly recommend this to other parents."
5,I bought two of them,"I received this as a gift from a hospital when my child was born. I tried swaddling my baby with a regular blanket numerous times, but I was too exhausted to fix it over and over. I loved this so much that I ordered two more; one with Micro-fleece and one made out of 100% cotton. My daughter wears it on a daily basis and keeps her warm."
3,Holy Velcro,I really like how easy this sleepsac is to get on and that I can easily change diapers in the middle of the night without taking it all the way off. But you better pray that you wrap the wings around properly the first time (or that baby's arms don't escape in her sleep) because the velcro is so crazy loud there's no way a sleeping baby won't wake up as you adjust it. That's my only complaint.
5,Excellent...keeps my newborn Warm,"We own 2 sleepsack swaddles and love them both. This one in Micro-Fleece for cold nights and one in cotton for warmer nights. I really like that they are easy to use, safe for baby and come in a variety of fabric and color options. My Daughter is very comfortable in this micro-fleece swaddle, it keeps her warm and she sleeps way better in it than in regular newborn sleepers. I have washed it several times and it still looks new. This is a must have for newborns."
1,DO NOT USE!!!,"I use to be a big fan of the Halo sleep sack...until I found my baby with the swaddle bundled around his face and neck!!!! Yes I did use the velcro tabs to supposedly hold the swaddle piece down, but they are not strong enough if my son can undo them in his sleep (he was sound asleep when I found him).Please please do not use these!!!"
2,Suffocation hazard for little Houdinis,"I received this very garment as a shower gift and my daughter wore it until she was a month old. She found a way to get her arms out from underneath the swaddle ""wings"" and I walked into her nursery one morning to find her lying in her crib with the material bunched up around her mouth and nose. Use this product with extreme caution!"
2,Still a Potential Hazard,"I, like other reviewers, have tried swaddling our baby with this only to find the material covering her mouth and nose when we checked on her later on. The product is a great idea, but given that it markets itself a SIDS preventer, I find this problem to be unacceptable."
2,Could be dangerous,"This is a great idea, but like another review said, they can raise their arms up from the bottom of the arm wrap which makes the fabric bunch up around their face. I bought a fleece one and a knit one. The fleece one would be too hot so I used the arm wrap from the knit one with the fleece sack. It's easy to get on but the fleece is bulky and makes it hard to burp them. I'll probably stop using it because I'm afraid of the wrap getting pushed up into her face."
4,Cute!,"Got an idea from baby registry.I bought it as a gift, so I can't tell you how good it is....But, I am glad I checked Amazon! They had more variety and also cheaper than other famous baby stores.As a Prime member, it only took 2 days to receive it.I didn't have to go anywhere during the holiday season - the busiest time of year, but still it made her happy!"
3,Too hot for a baby?,"I love this product in theory, but I found that it made my infant son sweat like crazy. It also was very bulky compared to the cotton version. I'm not sure if others have found this, but our fleece swaddle sack ran much larger than the cotton swaddle sack. While I love the Halo products, I will not be buying more of this one."
1,Old version was better,"I have a 3 year old and have an older version of this, but I needed a larger size for my 8 week old and I do not like this at all. The one I had before was in two pieces, the sleepsack and the ""wings"" or the wrap around. There was velco on the back of the sleepsack and on the ""wings"". I could have my baby in the sack and then when it was time for bed I would lay her down on the ""wing"" and swaddle her up and put her in bed. I thought it was the same now but it's not. The whole thing is one piece. My kid does not want to be bundled up and swaddled when she's not sleeping so the ""wing/swaddle"" part is all tangled up and we can't remove it, it's all one piece. Bottom line this was a great product until they changed and I can't return my b/c my husband already washed it. Bad purchase, change it back, you had a good thing going."
4,LOVE!,"Bought this for my daughter when she was 1 month and it is really cute. It is heavy fleece so baby doesn't need more then a onesie on under this, if even that. Normally I just put my daughter in her diaper when she wears this. I then have to make sure the room stays cool or she will break a sweat. I didn't give this 5 stars because it is a thick and heavy material so my daughter can over heat easily. Otherwise I love it. She is still able to wear it now at 3 months old even though she has been out of newborn clothes for over a month now, the halo sack is still long/wide enough for her."
3,Not used much,"Bought this for my grandson but if your baby needs to be swaddled, a receiving blanket will do just as well."
5,A life saver!,"We purchased this Halo swaddle wrap when the newborn size was getting too small for our infant. I was hesitant as to whether or not the size small would be big enough. It works well! Our baby was 12 pounds when we began using it and we will continue to use it for night time sleeping until the little one can roll over. Length is sufficient and material is fleece for warmth during winter nights. We dress the infant in a onesie, put the wrap over top and our baby keeps at the right temperature for sleep. I would recommend this purchase."
2,Not loving it,"I bought this sleep swaddle because we needed to transition our baby from the cradle in our room to her crib. We also live in a colder climate, so I wanted something that will keep her warm and toasty.She is almost 14 pounds and very long. Halo says size small is for 13-18 pounds. The first night, she worked her arms out several times. The last time scared the garbage out of me because as she worked her arms out, she brought it up over her mouth.We normally wear the miracle blanket, which she can't get out of and doesn't cause me to have heart palpitations. I think we'll go back to that one.Update: We had this same sleeper in a newborn size that she never wore because I thought she was too big for it. So, I tried it on and it seems to fit her better. We will try the smaller size tonight. Maybe it's just sized incorrectly."
3,velcro problems,"the NICU where our daughter was used these and we thought they were great, this one isn't as nice as what they had the Velcro is rough and I worried about it scratching baby. perhaps this will resolve with washing."
5,Great!,Works amazingly! Was a perfect upgrade to the newborn swaddler we had. Is very soft and warm. We love it!
3,Its okay,"Ita okay, havent use it much as its very warm and I dont want my baby to be too hot- they always say dont over dress ur baby. Even in onsie its really warm to be in it all night. Baby sweats a lot in it"
5,Love to Swaddle,Wish they made these bigger than newborn and small. I really liked to swaddle his arms at night to keep warm.
5,Halo Sleepsack,This sleepsack worked the best for my daughter. She wasnt confined like alot of the other sleepsacks. Gave her more room but made her still feel secure. Deffently recommend.
4,Nice product for colder climates,"This is a great swaddler sleepsack & pretty tough to get out of, even for the biggest wrigglers!! We used it regularly for my daugher during cooler months, but had to pack it away as soon as it got a bit warmer."
4,Quality,"Like most Rosle products, appears truly first class. Now if it doesn't stain or warp under heat it will be great for getting the last little bit of what ever you are making out of the container you made it in. Still, surprisingly small."
3,Older edition than I wanted,"The hymnal was in reasonable condition... but, I was disappointed that it was such an old edition. I take responsibility for not reading the sale info more carefully, I guess... I wanted a more recent edition of the hymnal, such as for the United Methodist Church... with more current liturgy and music. I will order another edition and keep this one for comparison and historical value."
1,Dumb,I'm eleven i still love barbie but mattel has gone WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY to far i mean a spy barbie i love spy stuff and barbies but together that is dumb me and friend got so bored after a couple moths we ripped off it's head filled it with milk then we coverd it in peanut butter and gave it to my dog she had way more fun with it then us it's buried in my yard now were it belongs
3,Hard to rate,"Nasaw is a very good writer and did an excellent job researching this book. I just didn't like Hearst. What a piece of work. In my opinion he never matured over the age of thirteen, and if you've ever raised kids, you know how they are. A control freak who ruled all his papers and editors by telling them what (and what not) to print, his narrow minded views included thinking Hitler was a good guy, Mexico was a threat (because he owned property there), and there was nothing he did not know.He spent millions of dollars he borrowed on ""stuff"" and building projects. He treated his family horribly while showering his mistress with mansions, trips, parties. He even bought a movie studio so she could do films.I kept wanting to slap him and say, ""get over yourself."""
4,Clear-eyed view of a much mythologized man,"Very entertaining, well-written and (rare these days) well-edited true story of WR Hearst's life (as opposed to the various stories and personas promulgated by his employees and enemies, not to mention Citizen Kane). I appreciated learning the truth; I held many misconceptions, as it turned out. But in the end, Hearst was four things: Newspaperman, wealthy American, businessman and builder of San Simeon. Nasaw covers the first two topics in depth, but tends to gloss the details of the latter two. I would have preferred more details of how San Simeon was arranged, how large its rooms were, and that sort of thing. And I suspect Hearst's capitalization structure and the details of his finances would have been interesting as well. But Nasaw quotes heavily from Hearst's editorials--he was a very persuasive writer--and describes the man's expensive habits and his courtiers completely. If you enjoy biographies, this is one, well-done."
4,"a fantastic life of matriarchy, castles, movies and money","WRH had interested me as a lesser (and later) addition to the robber baron lists. After reading Nawaw's work I have different picture - that of a man dominated by his mother yet domineering of others, at ease with maintaining a wife on the east coast and mistress on the west, obsessive with his material belongings yet neglectful of his children, never mindful of money yet never short of it, and a defender of personal privacy yet addicted to the spot light. A robber baron? Not so sure about that, but WRH was a baron (in the monarchial sense) no doubt. He lived like a medieval king - constantly pointing out flaws in others and ruling on those where he could, seemingly ignorant of his own contrary ways.The book can be a battle - Mrs H senior was tiresome and WRH did take a long time to reach his stride, but it is never dull and at the end I realised I had finished the most amazing story, all the more so as it is true."
4,The Definitive Biography,"I purchased this book when it first came out ten years ago and just finished it this morning. This is a very comprehensive study of Hearst's life and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in the subject. However, the book is very detailed and long, and I believe it could have been a better book if edited down by fifty to a hundred pages. In particular, the portion describing Hearst's relationship with his mother could have been significantly shortened without the reader missing anything important to their understanding of Hearst. Still it is an excellent study of Hearst and his times and should be viewed as the definitive Hearst biography."
2,Better books out there,"While I've found most ""dummies"" books to be comprehensive and objective, this one is not. Not only is it depressing (listing every food as a cause of IBS and recommending wearing adult diapers), it is also anti-Western medicine. Because the author has a doctorate of medicine and a doctorate of naturopathy, I had hoped this book would offer a well-balanced look at all avenues of treatment -- both Western and natural. Forget it. Every chapter ends with recommending a laundry list of obscure herbs and implementing her elimination diet.More information is never a bad thing and there are better books out there. ""The First Year: IBS"" is a good book, as is ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome & The Mind-Body/Brain-Gut Connections: 8 Steps for Living a Healthy Life with a Functional Bowel Disorder"" and ""The Second Brain: A Groundbreaking New Understanding of Nervous Disorders of the Stomach and Intestine."""
3,my review,"I found a lot of info in the book. It was one of the first I read on the topic of IBS. I would reccomend it as a starting point, on your journey of info collection. It is hard to say it is a great reference because every case of IBS is so individualized."
1,This book is a danger! Dean was ruled unfit to practice.,"[...]College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (Canada) concluded that Carolyn Dean, M.D. was unfit to practice and revoked her registration certificate."
5,IBS for Dummies,"This book is a life saver. It clearly and simply explains what IBS is and how to manage it to regain control over one's life. Prior to reading the book from cover to cover, beyond driving to work and back each day, I seldom left the house for more than a few minutes at a time. This book has changed all that and made my life liveable and even enjoyable despite having IBS. I can't say enough good things about the book and its author, Carolyn Dean, MD, ND. In my opinion, having both an MD and an ND permits Dr. Dean to understand what someone with IBS goes through each day and then focus on how to bring it under control. Bravo, Dr. Dean!!!"
5,"Melissa & Doug hit the mark, Again.","Excellent learning tool for young toddler to learn numbers, letters and colors. My toddler loved it. Durable pieces and backing boards. I'm satisfied with this purchase."
3,pieces fell apart,One of my number pieces starting coming apart before my daughter started to even play with it. It was easily fixed with glue but I wasn't happy about having to fix it before she could play with it.
4,Ok puzzles,these aren't like they used to be. The pieces are all interchangable on the abc puzzle. So they can put the wrong piece in the wrong spot. Otherwise no complaints.
5,Love these puzzles,"My daughter loves these puzzles. The great thing is they are teaching her the ABC's, 123's & her colors all while she is having fun!"
5,Perfect,I love Melissa and Doug puzzles and this was a great deal. I highly recommend it. It will be a gift for my son's birthday.
3,Poor Quality for a Melissa & Doug Product,The number puzzle was missing pegs to hold the numbers and the numbers and letters seemed cheap and ill fitting. The fish puzzle was great but my two kids love them even with the defects and cheapness.
5,Peg Puzzle,Good product from a reputable company. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality product. Will definitely do business with this company again!
4,"Great puzzles, one doesn't fit in rack","Our 2 year old son's speech therapist asked us to get him some peg puzzles to help with language skills, vocabulary, and fine motor skills. I bought several Melissa & Doug peg (not knob, chunky, or noisy) puzzles along with the Melissa & Doug rack meant to store them. A few of the peg puzzles were just a little too tall for the rack. They fit in it just fine, but the pegs interfere with the puzzle immediately above. In this set of three puzzles, the pegs on the alphabet puzzle were a couple millimeters too tall for the rack. The other two puzzles fit great. Why aren't the pegs all the same size? Very irritating."
4,Great but the shapes should not overlap,"Some of the letters and numbers can be placed on each other so it gets confusing for my 20 month old. In reference to the colors, wish they were slightly different for each color so that it does not give a false positive by fitting. Overall it is still a good learning toy and Melissa and Doug produce great stuff in general."
5,20-month old loves,"My daughter absolutely loves these puzzles, and they are so cute. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
2,Overpriced,Very overpriced for the product given. You can purchase these exact same things from your local walmart for less money.
3,puzzle,I got this for my niece that is 3. Since the package says for 3 and up. I ended up giving it to my other niece that is 18 months since it was more for her age. Good thing I have a big family or I would of sent them back.
5,Awesome!,"This is an incredible set, and I'm delighted we chose to buy it! My daughter has had a blast with it. We're definitely satisfied!"
5,Melissa and Doug 3pack Peg Puzzles,"Alright. These are awesome.There are 3 puzzles, one with numbers 0-9, one with the alphabet (all caps), and one with differently colored fish.What I love about these puzzles is that they have stuff UNDER the peg puzzle piece. For instance, under the letter ""A"" of the alphabet puzzle, there is a picture of something that begins with ""A"", and so on through the alphabet. It's really great and makes it easy to link the sound of the letter to the actual letter...The numbers have the correlating number of things under the puzzle piece...under the number one is one snake, under the 2 are two somethings, and so on through number 9.The fish/colors are great, too, I think they have the actual name of the color under the piece? But all the tails fit on all the fish, so you can mix them up and have the kid put them where they belong.These things are HOURS of fun, I tell ya. HOURS. My daughter wants to do them every day when I get home from work."
3,"Nice puzzles, poor quality control",These are nice sturdy puzzles and good for learning. The yellow fish in our fish puzzle came with a white puzzle piece instead of the yellow piece it is supposed to have so that was a bit disappointing.
3,Useful Toy,"I bought this toy for my 17 month old son. He loves it !!! At this stage he is more interested in taking all pieces away from puzzle rather than putting it back together. Couple of concerns I have with this toy are - 1. I noticed painted surfaces peeling off after little rough use, the shapes of letters does not real shapes of them, most of them are kind of sqaures."
2,Disappointed,I've been disappointed in all Melissa and Doug puzzles my little girl has received. All of them are labeled hand crafted but yet the 1st time she puts the puzzle piece in her mouth it is destroyed. The puzzle pieces have stickers on them and do not stay on after getting wet. We had these puzzles for about 15 minutes before the stickers started coming off. Would not recommend these to anyone whose child still enjoys putting everything in their mouth.
3,It's okay but...,"My two year old daughter likes to play with it but the quality of this puzzle is just okay.It's not thick as I thought and the size of each piece is little smaller than paved board.And the shapes of fish puzzle pieces are all identical & in small sizes.If I buy more puzzles for my kid, I will try a different brand next time."
5,great tool,"The zip wrench was a gift for my . We saw it in TV, and he said that wanted to try it. It does what it says it will do. Good gift. My husband really likes it."
4,"Nice, but the price!",The Rosle tea strainer is as advertised. A very fine mesh strainer and well made. All but the finest bits of some ground English Breakfast Tea were caught in the strainer. This particular tea blows right through an infuser basket. Regular tea leaves are no problem.The Stainless steel is easy to maintain but industrial looking. Not particulary attractive as a table accessory. The price for this item is very steep for what you get. A table caddy with a drip tray might make it a better value.A lot fo a little strainrr.
3,Tea cup strainer,"This tea cup strainer did not meet my expectations. I was hoping it would be a little deeper so it would seep better in my tea cup. The concept is nice, but the use factor is not worth the purchase."
5,"Works good, lasts a long time.","Works good, lasts a long time is a saying I picked up while in the navy which applies to this product."
3,"Nice,old-fashioned story","I am not versed in what time period this was supposed to be. Nice classic story with some heartwarming universal themes of relationships, hard work, forgiveness and redemption. I let it put me in a historical perspective of Depression-era but I would welcome reading a more modernized version of this to suit today's struggles."
4,well done,I was surprised to have liked this book as well I as did. A little simplistic perhaps but compelling nonetheless and quite descriptive. Will read again.
2,Ultimately Hollow,"The work really drew me in initially by showing ancient and modern, Arabic and Chinese, drawings of tales from the Arabian Nights. However, then it does nothing but keep re-showing those images. There is a paucity of interviewed scholars. Leonard Nimoy states that Ali Baba, Sinbad, and Aladdin are the most famous of the stories and then he summarizes each one. Well, that ate up time! The documentary asks many questions that it does not answer. It's mentioned that linguist Richard Burton eroticized some tales, but the tales that include same-sex sexuality are never brought up. This work presents itself as teaching something, but actually presents close to nothing."
4,Great necklace,I wear this necklace everyday and it is my second one. Great job in sending this to me. The only beef I have is that the first one cost half what this one cost.
4,Dance,This is for my granddaughter who loves to dance and sing. It will be a Christmas gift so I hope she'll love it.
1,Extremely Dissapointed,I really found this book to be a big BORE!! I was looking more towards a fitness program of some sort but instead found myself reading through jibber jabber that never really got to the point...FITNESS AND PERFORMANCE.
5,BUZZ THIS!!,"I have a forest/swampy area behind my house. And every summer I have every bug trying to get me. I've tried the candle's, the spray, nothing works. So I thought time to swing into action! I got it towards the end of the season, so I didn't get as many bug's as I will this year, but the one's I did had no chance against this thing.The mesh is big enough that even if you miss dead center, your more then likely going to get them anyways. It's light, but deadly!!(And it helps your back swing on the court!)"
1,it was defective`,the item did not work and was a waste of money. i recommend buying toilet paper instead of this.H
2,Batteries,"this thing takes batteries and doesn't hold a good charge, you have to change the batteries twice per day just to use effectively."
5,Yeah,Although it came slightly damaged we are very pleased with the item it's self... no more flies driving us crazy!
1,hot steaming pile of...,"a dud. Thought it was defective. Decided to verify / give it a second chance. Held it up to my ear, barely audible, unlike,my other (great )one/, of a different brand. Stuck my finger past all the childproof mesh and got a SLIGHT, ever so slight shock. Have yet to kill anything with it in a 5 day period. Better of using a shoe.Save your money. Buy a G200 Defender by Outset! with a green handle--those can be heard from far away when you touch the button & shock you afterword. It may be study, but that is all this offers. I guess the batteries fit well, unlike the 3rd brand i tried (if it says ''kills bugs instantly, electronic bug zapper, run for the hills-- don't get it). How 3 brands can all be from China, but only 1 was good says a lot. Don't get this; get the G200 by Outset instead-- it's only maybe a buck more and will put a hurt on them. It was worth at least 4 of these. I could not killl anything with it yet in almost a week."
3,o.k. but there are better ones,"This bug zapper works all right, but the ""safety"" guard over the actual zapper keeps larger insects like wasps from getting zapped right away.I prefer the immediate ""touch and die"" of the Charcoal Companion Amazing Bug Zapper which I bought at the same time. However, it ""stings"" if you touch it while pushing the ""on"" buttons!"
2,Meh,"It will eventually kill a nagging little pest, but not without a lot of effort. You can't just press the button and swipe at said pest; you have to hunt it down, getting the racket right on top of it with a little pressure before it will finally lay to rest. There are rackets out there that are effective (and, as an added bonus, fun to boot), but this isn't the brand. Unfortunately I don't remember the brand I had used before that did work."
2,poorly constructed,"It worked well for as long as it lasted---about 35 minutes. Just a mild swing at an elusive fruit fly killed the zapper (and not the fly). It stopped working after a couple of strong swings. A red light that comes on when the button is pressed showed that the batteries weren't a problem. in fact, a fly that got caught in the mesh managed to muscle its way out with little effort, with no pop/zap/spark which i saw the first few times when I used it. Poor construction, too delicate to handle swings at annoying creatures that make you chase them all over the place."
1,Doesn't work!,"This Electronic Racket doesn't work, even when trying it in a swarm of mosquitos. Not one zapped! I did get a lot of arm exercise trying to get it to work. This is a waste of your money. I recommend don't buy this. Sending it back costs too much. Another worthless piece of junk to toss."
3,My Fly Swatter,"I love it...I admit it is a challenge...but we make it a game. US against the FLIES....Or should I say ""flying insects""Kind of difficult to kill them. But btting around in the air eventually....One does get caught. A cheap item, no cost really. Fun challenge. But we still go for the old fashion fly swatter to do the job. It works the best. But all in all, not sorry we bought this one. It is a good conversation piece and fun for the whole family.That is, trying to outsmart the flies......."
2,Great Idea High Voltage Swatter,"PRO: this is a fantastic idea and actually works great, the kids leave the garage door open a lot and the garage fills up with fly. They tend to fly around is spots together so you don't even have to wait aim, just swing wildly a few times and you take most of them out.CON: Total FAIL on the battery freaking holder, once you put the batteries in then the battery door / cover does not close and latch so you have to hold the stupid thing all the way at the end where the door is to keep the freaking dam door closed or the batteries fly the hell out of the handle.Yet another great idea smashed by crappy engineering work.I would have gladly paid another buck or two per unit for the stupid battery holder to be properly designed. The engineer should be ASSHAMED OF HIM/HER SELF!I bought three of these and ALL THREE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM!"
1,This thing is suppose to kill flys?,"This thing is worthless, I actually trapped a fly against a window and it crawled through the wire mesh and got out! The button was pushed and nothing happened. I even went as far and got my multimeter out and checked the voltage (measured around 8 volts) on the wires. Not sure how this thing is suppose to kill bugs at 8 volts. I was doubtful prior to purchase but read the postive reviews and decided to try it out. One of those live and learn type of experiences."
5,Racket Zapper works,"After seeing my parents' racket zapper in action, I knew I had to have one myself. This is a great product and I feel sorry for the next fly in my house."
1,"looks like it will work, but...","I am not fond of houseflies, and have used a similar bug zapper with success -- it looks similar but has a much lighter handle, a different metal screen, and uses a 9 volt battery instead of D cells (that's why the handle is lighter). I am reasonably strong and athletic and play racket sports. But, and I suppose this is obvious, even with an electronic bug zapper you need to swing the zapper fast enough to hit the bug. With the 9-volt racket that is way lighter, this is easy. With this racket it is close to impossible unless you can get the bug to hover for you. This product is close to useless, get the other kind."
2,Weak,I bought this Zapper to replace another model (Charcoal Companion Amazing Bug Zapper) which worked great until I dropped it and it broke. This product is much weaker than the one I previously owned. It doesn't exactly ZAP the bug... it slowly shocks it. I seem to have to zap a bug 2-4 times before it dies and the death is not quick. I have replaced the batteries with brand new ones and same result. I have also have tried a 2nd zapper (I bought 2 to replace the 1 I dropped) and both just don't seem strong enough. I'm tossing these and purchasing another Charcoal Companion Amazing Bug Zapper.
4,They work!!,"Bought 3 of these, and all three work well. It's kind of fun to set bug traps (set out fruit, leave on a porch light, etc.) and then swing away.One note of caution, I've had two people tell me that it zapped a bug even when they weren't holding the button down. I can't confirm it as I havn't been able to replicate it, but I have no reason not to believe them."
2,Product shipped was NOT Lentek Biteshield,"I bought a Lentek Biteshield Electronic Racquet Zapper last year, and I was so pleased with it that I ordered four more this year. Unfortunately, I did not receive Lentek Biteshields; instead, I was sent Garden Greation Electronic Bug Zappers. The Garden Creation zappers have big, bulky handles and battery compartments that won't stay closed unless you tape them shut. They also feel cheap compared to the real Lentek Biteshield that I received last year. Very disappointing."
2,Cracked upon arrival,I was disappointed in the packaging of my purchase. The product works well but was slightly cracked from handling i guess. It does work on wasps and junebugs so it does get a couple of stars.
2,Let down.,"I really expected this thing to be like the one I used in Brazil, but its really weak and it doesnt really always kills the mosquitoes..."
4,handy item,"This is great for zapping mosquitos, flies, etc. However it is only $2-$4 at Harbor Freight Tools (chain store). Why pay more?"
1,Lousy product,"This product does not do anything as advertised. It doesn't zap bugs, doesn't even alter their flight pattern. I guess the voltage generated by this product is too low. Unfortunately, I was a little late in returning this as I had a busy past few weeks, but the alternative is the trash bin. It just doesn't do anything. If there was a way of giving it zero or negative reviews, I would."
1,Caution for Australian Buyers - Illegal Import,"I like to leave the balcony door open on my upper floor flat. The occasional fly likes to come in and aimlessly buzz around my lounge room; this gets a bit annoying when there are three or four circling above my chair.My idea was to avoid insecticide with one of these Racket Zapper thingies.It was seized by Australian Customs as a prohibited import. Among the many things not allowed are: ""Hand-held electric devices that are designed to administer an electric shock on contact, other than cattle prods designed exclusively for use with animals.""Pretty silly given the device and the obvious intent behind the regulation, but it does fall within the letter of the regulation.I might try a butterfly net instead. Can't see myself chasing flies with a cattle prod. Or mounting a public crusade to update the regulations to allow electric fly swats."
1,Doesnt work for gnats,"I don't understand how this works...but I think gnats are too small to make contact with the outside wires and the inside wires. However, smack your hand while holding the button and you learn very quickly (and painfully) it does have a charge. You will also get to see comic like sparks fly from you zapped hand. I guess its made for big bugs."
2,Smaller and less powerful than my last similar Bug Zapper,"I expected the grill area to be larger than it was. I bought another one like this a few years ago. It was much bigger and also ran off 2x AA batteries and cost the same amount, however I believe they went out of business. My last one was also much more powerful than this one. I'm pretty disappointed."
2,doesn't work as I was waitng.,"racket does not work as I was awaiting, is very soft I've seen other that are very powerful. if I depress the power button the bugs fly."
4,Bug Zapper,"This electronic racket zapper is great to kill spiders! However, for swatting flies in the air, it would be more practical if it had a longer handle. The racket would break into a million pieces if you had to swat a fly on a hard surface."
1,The flies are happy I bought this,"The flies are happy I bought this because it is so humane. Why, it doesn't even hurt them. This thing stinks. Go with a better model."
3,Hard to swat at flies fast enough,"Will only work if you're able to strike the insect with force. Great for a tennis workout, hard to kill flies since they are not tennis balls and fly all over the place."
1,DONT NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,does not work don't waist your money because u ll end up returning with return at your cost.. i went out and bought band new battery
1,jUST DOESN'T WORK!,"I've owned a version of this product from another manufacturer and it worked very well. This one simply doesn't kill mosquitoes or any small bug. I've had it for 2 weeks and have one kill (a very slow fly.) Since most people would want to use it to kill mosquitoes as well, this version is no good. Also, the racket head is smaller than other versions, making it harder to use as well. Look for a Racket with larger head and better reviews."
1,Electrical leakage,"It kills me not the fly. Cover the racket on a fly and push the button, after one minute the fly is still alive. On the other hand, I got electric shock twice when I tried stocking the racket (without pushing the button)."
1,Too small and one zap is not enough!,"This item's overall size makes it a challenge swat flies. Unless you want to get some exercise or hone your ninja skills I suggest getting one that is bigger instead. Expect to be chasing them around the room and swatting repeatedly. Additionally, one zap isn't necessarily enough to kill them. I've had many flies shake off the stun and start flying again, so to be sure I have to ""cook"" them till they're smoking just to be sure.As expected, it is not intended to smash them while they are sitting still. Doing so will just crack the unit, although mine still works.I will not purchase this item again, but in the future will look for another that is bigger and has more ""juice""."
1,Doesn't Work,"This product doesn't work. The fly spent 10 minutes crawling around on the inside of the netting (I caught it against a wall). He didn't seem effected by the electricity (if any) at all. I did feel the batteries getting warm, so I knew it was ""working."" In the end, I squished it with the plastic rim of the racket. Absolutely useless."
1,Doesn't work,Not sure if it was just because it was only two AA batteries but doesn't work at all. Can not feel any zap even when wetting fingers and touching it. May have just been defective but light turns on but nothing happens.
1,Dead on Arrival.,"As soon as I got it, I put in fresh batteries and went after a very large fly in the house. It didn't kill it; it didn't even stun it. So I stuck my finger into the mesh, and nothing. The red light was on, but there was no current to the mesh. This just goes to show that you get what you pay for. I tried to save a few bucks and now I have the hassle of returning it. Get the Charcoal Companion instead. It's about twice as expensive, but my friend has one and I know it works well (which is why I wanted to get one of these in the first place). Plus, the Charcoal Companion doesn't have the outside mesh layers. Common sense says having multiple layers of mesh just reduces your chances of killing the insect. Wish I'd used my common sense before wasting time & money on this cheap version."
1,Stinks! The fly lived in it for an hour an flew away!,"It doesn't work, unless you do it on YOURSELF. That is a shocker! The fly lived in the wires for a while and flew away. I smashed a few with it, literally, but that is it!"
1,Don't buy this!,I didn't have any success with this. I had to chase a fly around the house and knock it to the ground. Still the zapper didn't zap the fly. This was a complete waste of money.
1,Doesn't even work!,"This was a total waste of money. I got it so that I could kill bugs in the house without using poison. I put two AA batteries in, as per the instructions, and pressed the button when I wanted to turn the thing on. Last night I tried to kill a couple of spiders, and I ended up just shaking them off the bug zapper and stomping on them. One spider got inside where the electric charge was supposed to be, crawled around for a while without any ill effects, then crawled out and jumped off onto the floor. This zapper is a piece of junk!"
1,performance,this is a piece of junk. it worked for about 1 day then nothing. the red light is lit but it does nothing in the line of zapping bugs. what a waste of money. besides it is made in china. like so many other cheaply made product that is sold here in the states for 1000% markup.
1,Doesn't kill flies,"I gave this a good try, it stunned a couple flies, didn't kill even one. Don't even bother with this, I returned it."
1,Absolutely useless,"The electrical shock function of this product... does not function. The red light on the handle glows when the button is pressed, but that's all that happens. What's more, the tennis racket-shape makes it useless even as a conventional flyswatter."
1,Absolute Crap!,"I bought three of these. One worked for 1 week. The other two I left outside, and attempted to load batteries in one week later. Both warped so bad that most of the attachments for the handle screws broke, and in one of them the battery case warped so bad that the batteries would not make contact. The one in which the battery compartment was still OK didn't work anyways.You get what you pay for, and I got worse, one zapper that worked for a week and two that never worked."
1,Insect zapper,Piece of crap! One rattled and the other one I purchased didn't work at all. Don't bother buying this product!
1,Disappointed,"Bought and very excited when it arrived. Put in new and fresh batteries but it can't even kill a fly. The current is too weak to kill them. Totally disappointed. We used to have a racket which was a plug-in type and it did it job very well. Moreover, the racket is way too small. You have to be super fast to catch a bug. Totally waste of money!!"
1,Bug Zapper,"I purchased this because my father in law had one. I don't know the brand of his, but it works really well. This one broke the day after I purchased it. Real piece of junk!"
3,Slightly flawed,"The build quality feels pretty cheap, but I was expecting it to be like that. It zaps and kills bugs on contact, but only if the batteries are in place. The one I got doesn't securely hold the batteries in place, so sometimes I have to put the batteries back in before I kill a bug; with this in mind, I can't swing the racket to kill a bug because the batteries will fall out. I generally have to wait for a bug to stand still and then hit it with the racket.It's okay for what it does, but I'd get a different one in the future."
1,crap,"Cheap crap not worth more than $1. I get the version they sell at Walmart and they last a long time. I won't go outside after 5pm without one in summer, but not this version."
3,Only for small mosquitos,"This zapper uses 2 AA batteries and does not provide enough power to kill bigger insects in a single touch, for example, green flies. Also the zapper is pretty small (about the size of ping-pong racket). If you are looking for something to kill fast-flying big flies, this is not what you would need."
1,Can't Close the Battery Lid and Batteries Won't sit Properly,"Bought two different models at the same time.In essence, these two, look almost identical. Made in China probably by the same manufacturer.The batteries don't sit properly in the chamber and can't close the battery door shut.Had to use a rubber band to keep the lid closed and every so often, the batteries move and the zapper stops working so I have to take the rubber band off, take the lit out and replace the batteries in the proper place.Too much of hassle to return it.I definitely advise AGAINST buying this item."
2,Quarter inch mesh,"If your local bugs fit through the 1/4"" mesh, the thing works. Otherwise, you should stick with a manual fly swatter. My friend has a different brand that has no shield over the electric frying source. This one works better in our neighborhood.I should have read more of the submitted comments before I ordered. That is the value of studying history. You don't repeat bad decisions."
2,"Not great, due to lack of power...",Just not a good product. The zap only stuns the flies and they never die. Gotta have some more shock to make it more effective. Boooo!
1,Keeps mosquitoes alive and well,"I bought two of these and either has yet to kill a single mosquito, all while I continue to get bitten and confirming that it is charged by probing it with a piece of metal. My previous zapper, bought in Thailand for three dollars, worked much much better and had a larger zapping surface than this one."
1,No power,This item doesn't have enough power to kill a bug on contact. I bought one from walmart 2 yrs ago and it has way more power and runs on the same type batteries. I bought these for Christmas gifts and hope that I can return them. I'm embarrassed to give them out as gifts.
1,small racquet head with no power to kills,"This is the worst bug zapper. I've used many zappers before that had power but broke apart. This one, I dont ever see using it enough to break it.There is no power, cant even kill FRUIT FLY's, the racquet is also smaller than normal making it harder to kill bugs with. Overall this was a piece of junk that will be passed on the next garage sale."
1,Biggest fraud on amazon?,"Truly a horrible / fake product. I have trapped flies against a glass window while holding down the button and watched them bounced against the mesh for 10-20 seconds, then fly through and then dive bomb my head and mock me. This is a total gimmick and Amazon should take it off its site."
5,Koolatron Lentek Biteshield RZ02 Electronic Racket Zapper,i have used this a few times works well i haven't found a bug it wouldn't kill and it was a good price it shipped out quick if i needed another i would buy this again
1,Too weak and doesn't work,"I've owned numerous these type of zappers before and this is the worst I've ever had. The first I received was broken and they wanted me to pay for shipping it back to them. The second gave out after working for awhile. I found that when it did work, there wasn't much zap to its zapper. I had to zap the flies for awhile before they died. The ones I had in the past were more powerful and hence killed them faster. They also used a 9 volt battery instead of two AA batteries. I'm now going to order a different one and chalk this up to wasted money."
3,Fun but a 99 cent fly swatter works better,I have had this for a month in an office area that collects flies. Only one kill to my record. The problem is that you can not swat and hit a fly that has landed on a surface like a computer monitor. The old 99 cent fly swatter is better for my money. For the fun factor it gets a 10! But useless otherwise!
3,"cheap plastic, small head, stuns only","Like other reviews said, this indeed cheap plastic. I notice a crack and I haven't even hit any walls with it too hard. The head is smaller than appears in the photo so you have to be accurate and the greatest disappointment is that it only stuns mosquitoes and not kill them (most times, some will be killed) - I tried placing one in a jar and the next day he was back to flying. so now I use a tissue to dispose of the stunned ones.The reason I gave it 3 stars is that the price was really cheap (about 5$) so you can't expect too much out of it. it does a descent job."
5,Awesome Electronic Fly Zapper,"The electronic fly zapper works great on small annoying insects. A friend of mine let me try theirs and I knew I had to have one. It's light weight, easy to use and zaps bugs dead."
5,Love love love it!!,This racket is durable and I've never had a problem with it. The metal things don't pop out like some of the other ones I've had. I bought two of these because it was such a great price and I can't find them in stores. There's nothing better than the sound of killing a fly that has been messing with you for hours. This works great on mosquitos as well.
5,Awesome! This thing actually works!,"This thing is so much better than squashing a bug up against the wall or wherever with a swatter...not to mention more sanitary. I packs a wallup, so don't poke your pinky into it like I did (I couldn't help it; I was curious)! Half of the time, it makes a nice, loud 'zap' noise, letting you know you've made contact with your target. Sometimes, this doesn't kill the insect...but it will disable it so you can scoop it up with a tissue & dispose of it. I see other reviewers mention the build quality...I have NO issues with it whatsoever. For around $10, it's pretty sturdy. Do you guys expect this to be made of iron for $10?? YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SMACK THIS HARD AGAINST YOUR TARGET...IT WILL BREAK! IT'S NOT A FLY SWATTER!! All you need to do is make contact with your target & the zapper will do the dirty work. I'm so pleased with it, I bought another one. I highly recommend this item. Get one before the bugs GET YOU!! :P"
5,Kill the Flies,"Can't stand flies - this thing solves the problem. Has slight resistance due to protective grate, but overall really love it."
4,Fun!,"This zapper is fun! We have a ton of flies out on our patio and our outside room and it makes getting rid of them a lot more enjoyable. For the price this is a great product. Our zapper for some reason has a short or something and sparks in one spot when you have the button pushed down, but it's not a big deal. The guard on the outside of the wires makes it difficult to kill larger bugs like moths, etc. but great for flies."
1,NOT effective on Yellow Jackets and inhumane,"I bought this hoping for a QUICK, PAINLESS (for the bug, not me) way to get rid of the yellowjackets that keep getting into our house (2-3 a day). It incapacitated MOST of the yellowjackets ONLY IF I HELD THEM DOWN WITH IT FOR SEVERAL SECONDS. If I merely swatted them, it did nothing but tick them off! One actually fell to the floor after a good long zapping, bounced back up, and tried to STING ME! (Thank goodness I was wearing a jacket at the time)! Those that the racket DID kill took a long time to die, and it was a slow, writhing, agonizing death. I could smell roasted yellow jacket for hours afterwards. Ugh. If yellow jackets are your problem, save your money and buy a GOOD bug vacuum instead."
5,GREAT!,Have a long history loving 'Racket Zappers' in general. This one:1. A bit smaller than other brands (head is smaller and handle is shorter). I like it better being slightly smaller and therefore more able to quickly maneuver.2. NO ZAP SOUND! Love the fact that this one does not make any zap or noise at all. The ones that make a loud Zap really scare my dog.3. The extra protective screen/Zapping Area does seem not as strong and might let some insects get by/through.4. Feels more sturdy and less likely to break.ALL IN ALL = Get the Racket Zapper but if you want a zapping sound or a more powerful electric charge you may want to get one of the other almost identical versions of this product for sale also on amazon for almost the same price. I personally will always go back and buy this one in the future.
1,Do NOT buy this. Complete crap; knock-off at best,"1.) Its not the product pictured2.) The racket falls apart when swung in the air3.) The soldering of the wire connecting the grille to the battery snaps when racket splits as #2 above4.) At a rate of less than a dozen flies killed before the piece of crap broke, after shipping, I paid nearly a dollar per fly. No friggin bueno.I bought the real thing at an actual store and its sturdier, has better wiring and has already killed more flies than nickels spent on it. (same price as this fraudulent product, fyi [and: no shipping!])"
5,swat,"This product is awesome but does not include the batteries to operate the fly swatter. You need about 4 AA batteries. Anyway, it was awesome!"
2,Biteshield Racket Zapper works great!!!,"It's much easier to kill the unwanted flies and mosquitoes! All you have to do is pick up the racket, hold the ""on"" button, and SWING! The bugs fall down for easy pick-up. : )"
4,It works...for slow moving insects.,"Don't let kids handle this, it gives a painful quick zap. Works very well for slow flying or crawling insects, like spiders, and bigger insects. The net part is raised because of the thick yellow border so you can't really swat an insect flat but just ""gently"" zap them.. But for a fly??? Good luck!! You can't really swat a fly with it because, well, you can damage it by doing so. So we end up swinging it as we see flies in the air. But it is faster to use a regular swatter for flies."
4,Culpeper's Complete Herbal,"If you have an interest in Herbs and their culinary, mystic and medicinal usages, both modern and historical, then this IS the book for you. It is beautifully illustrated and text is written in both medieval English and modern English.Each plant (it includes some fruits and trees as well) is pictured and the habitat is described. Along with each description is any affinity to a ruling planet as well.My only critisism is that it contains a great deal of jargon, you will need to read up on herbalism per se to understand how to make tinctures etc. That said the book is a reference to the plants not the art.I have had my (well thumbed copy)for over 10 years now and it is a constant companion to my interests in the natural power of the Earth and her fruits."
5,One of the Best Herbals I Could Recommend.,"I actually own the Wordsworth Editions, Ltd. 1995 edition of this book, and did not purchase it from Amazon. But I still feel the need to write a review about Culper's work.Hands down, this is still my go-to Herbal to date. Even as well worn and falling apart at the seams as it is. Of course, as out-dated as some of the medical information of it is in the beginning and it should be used in conjunction with more modern materials... It's a great companion book I often use it in conjunction with my other Herbals to cross reference materials. And still, to this day, it's got some of the most inclusive information on the herbs listed compared to even the majority of my modern Herbals.I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Herbal Medicine, Holistically or Scientifically, or even for personal use."
1,TRASH--BUYER BEWARE!,"This kit is total trash, if you really want a Stinger HP, save some bucks and buy one, because it's the only way you'll get one. This head not only adds bulk to your Stinger, but it also makes the light beam weak. The light gets dimmer, and there are a lot of dark rings in the beam of light. The light does not travel as far anymore as it used to before adding the upgrade head. It kinda reminds you of the old Maglites. DON'T BUY IT!! You'll be wasting $30 if you do. I don't even know why Streamlight came up with this piece of trash."
4,I love this - but it's not NECESSARILY for little ones,"I LOVE this book! I think the illustrations are just about perfect and the twist on the tale is delightful! And my oldest son loves it, too. He giggles right along with me. However.... my youngest son finds it a bit macabre for his taste. The pictures seem to frighten him and when Cinderella loses her foot, well.... that just doesn't sit well with him.So, as with any children's book, know your audience.... especially those that are easily prone to nightmares."
4,Problem solved.,"The Camco 43977 RV screen door push bar solved my problem. It looks good. It mounted really easy to the door. Now I can use my hip to hold open the screen door while I unlock the main door, without pushing out the screen in the storm door, when the window of the door is in the open position. I can also raise and lower the storm door's window easily if I want, with the push bar mounted to the door. I didn't use it on an RV, I used it on my summer home side entrance storm door. It looks good, and solves an irritating issue."
5,I love it!!,This toy is really cool it has a very nice bed I recamend putting in a nice little blanket big enough to fit the bed.It has'nt been breaking on me I had this toy for 3 years andI have'nt heard a weird noise yet or changed the batteries.It comes with great accseories.I really don't like Barbiesso I got that house for my Bratz and it's great (i made theguy sleep downstairs on the floor he likes it there.)Just soyou know only 1 doll can fit in the upstairs bed mabey Barbieshould lose some weight.
2,save your money and time putting on stickers,"Just go ahead and find the Barbie play and store dollhouse...it is HUGE, very nice, and very DURABLE...My daughter plays with her my little pony toys in it more than Barbies...but that is her 1st choice of toys....PLEASE do yourself a favor and and purchase the Barbie play and store doll house at TRU.....well worth the money spent...btw, purchase some furniture @KB!!!"
3,"I was happy, daughter was disappointed.","I recieved this free during a promotion so I can say I am definatly not out anything, I would not have actually paid for it though. I thought it was pretty nice, it folds up so there is no storaaage, it is light weight and my 5 yr old can move it around the house easily enough. My daughter says it is no good, she said that she always has to put the furniture back in place and that the door bell does not always work, she just overall is disappointed with it, I think it will just depend on the child."
1,Barbie Houses,"When will Mattel learn to use more durable materials when constructing their Barbie houses? The first Barbie houses were made out of cardboard (even the furniture)! In the late 60's Mattel began making Barbie houses out of cardboard covered in a smooth, almost stretchy-type of plastic (but the furniture was thin and brittle). Currently, Barbie houses are constructed out of a brittle-type of plastic and I am through wasting my money on them. Why doesn't Mattel wise up and use the same material for their houses that Barbie dolls are made of? Even better would be to use the type of plastic that Little Tikes uses for its toys. Perhaps it's a ploy and Mattel really doesn't want their Barbie houses to last!"
3,Barbie Talking Townhouse Pros and Cons,"My daughter received this for Christmas. It is a nice toy. It folds for easy storage and comes with plenty of furniture and other items. It was great that we did not have to spend lots of time putting it together. It is also nice that my daughter can move it to where she wants it. On the downside, there are alot of stickers to be put on. My daughter also noticed that while there is a shower, there is no toilet and there is an oven and sink in the kithen but no refigerator.Overall it is a nice toy and holds up very well (table pops off..no big deal)but there isn't alot of attention to detail!!"
1,Barbie Talking Townhouse,"My 6 year old daughter received the talking townhouse for xmas. It was the ONLY thing she wanted from Santa. Well after we got it together and put the stickers on (which were a pain because she wanted to do it herself and kept getting them on wrong and ripping them) It is definitely an adults job) She has not played with it since. Lost interest after only an hour of play. Most certainly not worth the $...I spent, am very dissappointed with this toy. Thank goodness Santa didn't listen and brought other toys for her to enjoy."
3,The house talks?,"My six-year-old sister is crazy about Barbies.My mom bought this product for my sister for Christmas.She was very excited.I thought it looked crazy.This is so stupid-an ugly house that takes keys through a slit and talks.My sister liked it at first,but it got boring after about ten minutes.Even my sister agreed it was dumb.It is the most uneducational thing ever."
4,Great Deal for my little munchkin!,"This was a great deal on the Talking Townhouse. Like the review before mine, I also ordered the $75 worth of Barbie toys and recieved it free. On top of that after $75.00 the shipping was free! I couldn't believe the deal when I saw it! For a final total of $74.10 I got my daughter the Barbie Cruiseship ,the Talking Townhouse, and the Mommy Midge doll. Thank You ToysRUs!!!!!!"
1,Never recieved.........,Cannot find a real person to call about my order. UPS does not show that it has been shipped and it is two days after my receiving date. Was shipped and charged to my account. Only have 7 more days to receive at this address. What do I do afterwards......
2,lack of quality,"If you are looking for a Barbie house that is durable, I would strongly advise you to check out another house. This house is very flimsy, cheaply made and not worth the money. It comes with extremely small pieces. It is very hard to operate for small hands (larger hands also). If you are like me you spend a lot of money with Barbie, this certainly does not deserve a penny. Barbie does offer another 3 decker house, very sturdy, very well built and a much better choice."
3,This toy will break!,"I think this dollhouse is cute and bought it for my 3-year-old daughter so she could have a fairly compact house for her Barbies. However, after one afternoon of play I could tell the second floor of this house might eventually break. My daughter and her friend kept leaning on the second floor with their hands and the support structure does NOT appear to be strong enough to handle much weight---it kept on creaking like the plastic was going to snap! Also, the second floor did not stay connected to the side of the house as the design intends. I returned the dollhouse immediately!"
2,Talking Townhouse should talk more,"My 6 yr old daughter Lauren, got this for her b/day. Yes, she likes it and plays with it, but it doesn't say too much. The only places that it talks is at the front door, shower and kitchen. She used to have a dollhouse that said 3 to 4 different sayings in each room of the house, plus the doll figures said many different things as well. I would have bought that same dollhouse again but I don't think it is being made anymore. Anyhow, I would think about this one, it really doesn't do too much for the money. If the cost was only $35.00 then I could see it being worth the money, but not at its current price.R.B"
3,Could it have been made any cheaper?,"This house folds up for easy storage but that causes its main flaw. Trying to maneuver a Barbie in this house is difficult. The couch back collapses, the bed jiggles all around. It is flimsy in design, it is like in order to make this house fold up it needed to be a very weak structure. My daughter just moved up from playing with ""little people"" dollhouses to a Barbie dollhouse and we are disappointed at how cheap the construction of this house is.There was little assembly with this house. We just had to pop in some windows. Putting on the 40 stickers took the longest time and the diagram was lousy but it was no big deal.Bottom Line: My daughter likes it, but I wish we spent the extra money and got the dream house."
2,unable to cut block cheese,"I was thrilled to see such glowing reviews before I purchases this cheese knife. They led me to make the decision to purchase.I purchase one pound block cheddar cheese and want a knife that will cut through cleanly.Not so with this knife. It makes uneven slices, and takes considerable pressure to slice through. In addition the blade does not easily accomodate a hands palm when applying pressure to the cutting process. It looks quite handsome...the only saving grace of this product."
3,This Doll Is Okay,"I think I like this Barbie because she looks different. She doesn't look like your tipical barbie: Blonde hair, Same ol clothes. She looks like she might be ethnic, or maybe she just has a good tan!"
5,Unique Barbie,I have never seen a barbie like this one. Her skin tone is so pretty and tan. Her skirt is longer than shown here and she is simply stunning. A very unique add to my collection. I absolutely love her.
4,This is a BILINGUAL dictionary.,"This book is (obviously) a BILINGUAL dictionary. Like all the millions of bilingual dictionaries, this book gives the Spanish equivalents of English words and the English equivalents of Spanish words. If you just want to know the definition of a word in your own langauge, then any old normal dictionary will do. If however you want to know how to say a word in another language, then you need a BILINGUAL dictionary. So this dictionary must be great for any student who wants to improve his or her psychology vocabulary in Spanish (or in English for native-spanish speakers). Of course, a monolingual person who never bothered to study a foreign language and has no interest in doing so, would not understand the usefulness of a bilingual dictionary, and so would of course just send it back. He should have first looked up the spansish word ""tonto""."
2,Great Potential,"While this dictionary could have been useful for me in translating psychometric instruments, the editors apparently decided that listing the gender of the words wasn't needed. Perhaps they are also the sort of people who think that translation involves finding the equivalent word in the other language and setting it down in the same order. A disappointing tool."
1,"Word-list, not dictionary, and highly inaccurate","This book is quite useless as a dictionary. I suspect it was created using a computer to carry out one-to-one word substitutions. A human lexicographer hardly seems to have been involved at all. A few examples of words whose translations vary considerably according to context but which are given one-word translations here are Eng. ""approach"" (entry: Sp. ""acercamiento""), Sp. ""ilusión"" (entry: Eng. ""illusion""), and Sp. ""control"" (entry: Eng. ""control""). Many of these are classic translation errors. No note is made of parts of speech or gender. There is no entry at all for Eng. ""report"", whether noun or verb. It's astonishing that this book was published."
1,Wily's English/Spanish Dictionary of Psychology and Psychiatry,"Rip-off--this ""dictionary"" does not have one single definition. IT ONLY TRANSLATES THE TERMS. I am sending this back.At the same time, I also ordered the Intro to Psych in Spanish which has yet to arrive. I will also send this back because it was a time sensitive purchase. The student who we were ordering for had to drop outof the class due to your delayed devlivery. Probably the last time I will order from you and will let my students know to look elsewhere."
1,This is a dictionary ??,I've never heard of a dictionary without definitions. Fairly useless for students. I sent my copy back.
1,Useless,"I recently translated a document about pscyhology from Spanish to English and found this book to be utterly useless. For example, under ""psicopedagogia"" it gives ""psychopedgagogy,"" which is just a silly literal transation. The word actually means ""educational psychology."" It did not contain the term ""psicologia evolutiva,"" which means ""developmental psychology."" Instead, under ""developmental psychology,"" it simply gives another literal translation: psicologia del desarrollo. In short, the book is full wrong, literal translations. It will not be of use to any serious translator. I'd stay away from it."
1,PAW PAW LOUISIANA,PROS; NONECONS;THIS CLIPPER GETS TOO HOT TO THE SKIN TO FINISH ONE HAIR CUT ALSOTHE HOTTER IT GETS THE LOUDER IT GETS.
3,seems to work well,"we bought this to mash our refried beans as our standard wavy style potato masher left the beans pretty unscathed. This works well, but the price is too high. My husband bought this because he loves other Rosle products as well (like the cool can opener)"
5,The Best Potato Masher Ever!,"After having several other potato mashers fall apart on me during the most inconvienient situations (i.e., while mashing avocados for guacamole), and nearly being impaled in the process, I bought a Rosle. The difference is phenomenal. Rosle's products combine great ergonomic engineering with high-quality stainless construction, and the masher is no exception. Its design allows the cook to combine just the right amount of force more precisely, resulting in effortless and lump-free mashing (no more problems with cranky avocados), and it cleans up easily. I've had mine for over a month, and suspect it will be the last potato masher I'll ever buy -- unless, of course, I need an additional Rosle."
2,Tried it ... Didn't like it.,"The Good:- The handle's pommel guard, which keeps the potatoes from stabbing back while they are being mashed.The Bad:- Mediocre results. Not much better than traditional thick wire mashers; on a par with similar (and much cheaper) grid mashers, like WMF and Oxo.- Too short when mashing in a large bowl -- needs longer handle.- Pommel guard and long bars are not shaped for easy cleaning.- $$$$$!!!! $45 is ridiculous!"
1,Made in China,"Unfortunately the manufacturing info on this item is inaccurate. Rosle sold out their fellow countrymen and shipped the jobs to China, supporting a country with extreme human rights violations and criminally lax environmental and product safety standards. Quality is now dubious at best and only worth a fraction of the price being charged."
4,THE EASY RIDERS,"After the Weavers and before the Kingston Trio were Terry Gilkyson and the Easy Riders, who charted with the hit Marianne in 1957.I am against white groups singing the blues. However, this was in the time of racially segregated America and their recordings are good and professional, even if a little too professional and lacking the feelingportrayed by Peter, Paul and Mary. Gilkyson was also a member of the Weavers before Joe McCarthy."
5,WOW!,"...Lobo y Melon's claim to fame is having introduced Bebop improvisation to afro-cuban music. In addition, it is by far the best Mexican group in Cuban genres. They definitely blow Sonora Santanera away. If you are a fan of Buena Vista Social Club, & Perez Prado you will not be disapointed by the musicianship & sophistication of Lobo y Melon. Their intricate rhythms & virtuoso contra melodies will win you over!"
3,Reasonably OK Fulci Sci-fi,"Among the many, many other Italian post-apocalyptic films made between 1982-1984, this one lies about dead in the center. Not nearly as dreary as EXTERMINATORS OF THE YEAR 3000 and RUSH, but not quite as classy as ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX, RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS, or even ENDGAME.Fulci really is a giallo/horror director at heart, and his touches for the most part fail miserably with this film. The story pre-dates the Running Man, but isn't too terribly interesting. For the most part, the film is saved by its great cast (Jared Martin, Al Cliver, Donald O'Brien, Claudio Cassinelli, Fred Williamson, Al Yamanouchi, and Howard Ross) and decent music by Riz Ortelani (CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST). The special effects, however, are mind-numbingly wretched, and the final chariot chase scene has to be among the cheesiest ever filmed.Fans of Fulci's gore flicks will be disappointed, but those who have seen most of Italy's other post-apoc flicks should realize that they get a lot worse!"
4,on how we can change the world,"this is a really good book for covens and people that want to make a difference in the world. it emphasises on teamwork. it showes how each one of us needs to change the world. it can become dull,but still a good read."
3,a good story,"This tale is loosely linked with Ann's Lord of the Keep. The hero from that story is friends with the hero from this tale.Lord of the Mist starts out with the hero, Durand, burying his unfaithful wife and trying to come to grips with the baby girl she left behind. He knows the child is not his but is willing to raise her as his own. In the chapel he finds a woman who he needs for his soul as much as the child needs her for nurishment. The woman, Cristina, is the child's wet nurse. Cristina is the wife of Simon le Gros, a horrid man who uses Cristina to furthur his own causes.Cristina is a healer who not only tries to help those who are sick and needy but she also tries to bring light and love back into Durand's life. Durand has a very hard time learing to trust again but soon realizes that Cristina is the only one who can make him live again.This is a very sweet story. I have enjoyed many other books by this author since this book. I am looking forward to more from her."
2,Didn't last long,Gave this slicer a chance but only lasted a few months before the wire broke. I could even live with that if Amazon carried the replacement wires. However the only place I found them was on the company's website. I've sinced purchased theNorpro Cheese Slicerand find that much easier to use and very sturdy.
1,Broke after 2 months,We have tried many different cheese slicers and decided to get this one because it seemed heavy duty and was pricey. The wire broke off after 2 months of regular use. Now it's worthless. Very dissapointing!
1,Sleek looks but no performance,"The wire broke after about three slices (of soft mozzarella), with no evident way to repair or replace it. Additionally, the stainless handle is too highly polished and easily becomes slippery. Leverage is not as good as the cheaper ""T"" shaped wire cutters."
1,don't buy it!,"I have had an aluminum T type cheese slicer for over 26 years. It has seen hard, continual use, and thankfully is still in my possession. I bought this Rosle just over 6 months ago, have used it probably less than 10 times, and the wire broke tonight. Of course, the return period expired 2 months ago! The Rosle has not been abused, or overused. It just broke doing the task it is supposedly engineered to do. Buy something else! Not this!"
1,Nice thought but .....,"It's basically a box- no frills, NO TURNTABLE, so you constantly have to open it and rotate your food. Our custom built house came with options from the builder and a microwave drawer in the island sounded great. I didn't even think to check for a turntable. That seems like a standard item. The idea of a microwave drawer built-in to the island was great. If I were you I'd wait until the next generation when prices come down and features improve."
1,Discontinued and Priced Higher then New Model,This is a Discontinued Model and has been Replaced by another Model for a while and this is Priced Higher then the New Model. Why would that be? Discontinued means Replaced by Newer Model with more features and Price doesn't Drop
2,Disappointed,This Rosle strainer shows all the signs of a poorly made product.It may have been - originally - designed in Germany. Today the product reflects rushed execution and lack of skill in its manufacture. I am disappointed.
2,How did this make it on Amazon video?,"This is someone's home movie of a trip to Nepal. Keep that in mind before you rent it. It has some cheesy dissolves, wipes, and effects from whatever home video editing software they used, and what little narration there is somewhat thin. Not bad for a home-made vacation film, though. It has a certain raw charm, I suppose, but I can't really recommend it."
3,Pretty good Pruning Knife for the price,"I felt like I wanted/needed a pruning knife but was not particularly interested in paying a lot for one. This knife seemed like a nice compromise, and it is. Both the knife and the handle are stamped out of thick stainless steel plate (hopefully the blade is out of harder stainless than the handle), making a very compact and hopefully durable knife.The double bevel blade required a quick sharpening, which was not too surprising.What was surprising was the way the handle seemed to want to cut into my hand. I did not take the time to look under magnification to verify that the stamped edge had a burr, but rounding the edges with a stone quickly improved the way the handle felt in my hand. Even after rounding the edges of the handle, the thinness that makes it easy to fit in a pocket may make it harder to use than a more ergonomic handle."
2,Sorry to burst your bubble but this one can wait.,I would never criticize someone elses opinion but I truly believe that this book was not the most original of Catherine Coulter's previous books. The plot did not thicken at all until the end and the characters were not fun or creative at all. I have read quite a few of her novels and have found this one to be my least favorite. She could've put this book together a little better than she had.
2,Can't really remember,"The is not one of her best. The story is weak. It took me some time to get into the story. I felt that even though Evangeline had physical strength, her mental strength was weak. If your laying on a beach in the tropic's you would be able to read easily."
1,Tedious,"This book was a struggle. First the author is far to wordy, and this type of book should run no more than 300 pages. I used to enjoy Catherine Coulter, but lately she's become hard to read."
2,CURSES SPOILED AGAIN!,"ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER ROMANCE NOVEL OF GIRL OF MYSTERIOUS INTRIGUE STORMING INTO YET ANOTHER DUKES LIFE TO TURN HIS WHOLE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN ADMIRING HER FOR HER SPUNK,WILL AND DETERMINATION PROVIDED HER'S IS NEVER TO STRONG THAN HIS I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF SPUNKY MADIENS FALLING OFF INTO A YOUNG MAN'S STRONG ARMS. IF U WANT GOOD READING TRY THE SKYE' O MALLEY WRITINGS BY BERTRICE SMALL NOW THOSE ARE SOME BOOKS WORTH STAYING UP ALL NIGHT FOR"
2,Could be much better,"Does anyone notice that this book is rather boring. I started off excited to learn something, but that wore off when I was forced to read page after page of code. The author never explained why there are certain files, or even what files are neccessary."
5,Torque or bust!,"If you are aspiring to learn TGE, the Torque Game Engine from http://garagegames.com, then buy this book right this moment! It's well written, and covers the most awesome game development tool there is: Torque.My only gripe is that it's super-specialized to the particular tools on the CD. For example there is 14 pages on ""Ultraedit 32"", a Windows programmer's editor. And Milkshape is used instead of Blender for character modeling. But, OTO that's one of the nice aspects of the book it's ""All in One"". Like the swiss-army-knife of game development."
1,Was the code even reviewed?,"I am ready to give up on this book. I have the second edition, and can't imagine how others are making it work. The code sample for the very first project doesn't work. I eliminated typing errors by using the code provided on the CD, and it still doesn't work.There does not appear to be an errata website.Many items seem glossed over without any explanation given as to what they do.Given the price I paid ($65), and the name of the book, I would have expected more breadth, rather than a straight shot at building a FPS game. Running the final version of the end product, it is bad enough that I am now questioning the $150 that I spent on TGE. The physics of the vehicle are so poor, that it frequently gets into oscillation or total rollover on the smallest of obstacles, for example.I can't imagine using this tome to attempt to learn TGE. I hope that TGE is better than what is portrayed in this book. At least I didn't blow the $300 for TGEA!"
4,Yes it does come with a stock version of Torque,"Just responding to a mistake by another reviewer. This book comes with an unmodified stock version of Torque, specifically version 1.2, downloaded from CVS on January 10, 2004. If you buy a Torque license (cost $100), you will be able to download that old version of the Torque source.>The book includes a pre-compiled version of the TGE,>however it is not a stock version and no source code>is included in the book, so the book's engine cannot>be re-compiled or debugged. The TGE included in the>book also has been modified by the book's author at>the C++ code level. Therefore, it doesn't behave like>the stock TGE in all respects.I have not read this book, and my rating is based on its reputation among Torque users. It is a good beginner book with occassional (minor) mistakes in the code."
5,3D Game Programming All in One,Book arrived in new condition in a short period of time. I was very satisfied with the transaction
2,boring,"First, I can not hide the fact that the authorput a valuable effort in this book, it is a goodbook but still I have some criticism. like everybook when it deals with straight forward things,it gives u full details but when it comes to realstuff starts summarizing stuff. I can understandthis since the book talks about so many topicshowever the main disadvantage of this book is thatit did not succeed in giving the reader a goodunderstanding on how is the code provided interactswith the engine. I do not know, I can not word it wellbut the key point as u proceed reading the booku feel like it is easy going but when u reach thereal meat you start feeling that the writer started torush. I have no problem with just summaries but what isimportant is the context, when u talk about the engineand scripts, u need to explain what the hell are theseclasses and call back functions that are just copiedto this book."
1,Stay away... there are better ways to learn...,"I should have examined this book more closely before purchasing. It's not a learning tool, most of the chapters focus on following directions with no real explanation why. Needless to say this will leave people out to sea when it comes time to fly solo.That situation is exacerbated by the fact that the book doesn't match the cd contents, so it's impossible sometimes to follow even the step-by-step procedures... not that they would teach you much anyway.Unfortunately for the publisher, the code given is also buggy... adding the final nail in the coffin for this book.Stay away, don't waste your money, there are better resources to learn from."
3,Not as good as I had hoped.....,"I really enjoyed Billy Strange's rendition of the James Bond them and thus I thought these western movie themes would be just as good. They are not bad but I have heard better.The songs start off with some cheesy sound effects like cattle, or a gunfight or the sounds of horses, etc.The last track (the secret agent file or whatever) is nothing more than a commercial to go to the website of the company that produced the CD to start with! They couldn't find just one more Billy Strange tune to stick on the CD??"
3,16 Personality Types,"The item was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner, but I was expecting a book and not a pamplet and thus much more in depth. I don't know if there is a category for such things, but I thought it was misleading (maybe it was noted somewhere on the web page, but if it was I sure didn't see it.)"
3,Good for the everyday person...,"Good general information, not too technical. Fun, refeshing view of type in action. Concise..."
1,Highly ineffective,This book is based on the MBTI system and please understand that this system has serious flaws. The only effective system to personality typing is used by Rod Novichkov in his book How to Find Yourself and Your Best Match Socionics. Eventhough the book sounds like a matchmaking book it is infact written with the purpose of explaining the different personality types and goes further to explain morphology and intertype relationships between people. Read Socionics and inspire your professors to look at this type theory before you seek answers from MBTI; you will be impressed.
4,Better than I expected,"Well built, solid blade and handle. I am very satisfied with the knife - however, be aware it is not that sharp when first purchased - you need to sharpen it before using."
3,pretty good,"Jodeci was the group of the Early 90's easily.they were Versatile&Could Bring the feeling in there material.""Forever My Lady"",come&Talk to Me,Feenin,Get on up,&there Cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Lately"" are all must haves. the problem with Jodeci is that they did there best sutff mainly off there Debut Album with a Few other cuts beyond that.they are a Group that didn't reach there Full Potential to me.good to see KC&Jo-Jo still out here.there should have been more to Devante Swing than what we have gotten thus far.but for going back down memory lane this is a cool set."
3,Great to hear the first album songs,"Debut album rocked and was a classic in so many ways...dance, tunes, music, energy, the remainder is mixed bag as egos came and they parted ways at times."
4,Good CD,"This Cd is definitely a must buy for the old school and the new. These guys only lasted three albums but they were hands down the best group in the 90's.Its unfortunate that there run ended so soon but Jodeci combined church melodies with smooth R& b and gansta R&B as well. The track listing was correct except for the ""Come and talk to me remix"". That was the summer jam in 91 and i can't believe its not there. Some of their stuff from the last album could have been left off as well. Another thing i found surprising was that Kc and Jo-jo's hits were not there. It would have been good to add tracks like all my life but i guess they only wanted to make it a Jodeci only album. Nonetheless this cd is a must by."
5,Memories......,"WOW! What a great CD! It is so hard to review a greatest hits CD at the title says it all: GREATEST HITS!!! They had some of the biggest hip/hop & R&B; hits of the 90's and they are just as great when I crank them up today. Each song has a memory or a story tagged to them taking me back to that moment in time. It's all here....not missing a beat. Some of the remixes we could have lived without but that still does not take away from all the great hits that are on here. They have all their great slow jams from ""Come And Talk To Me"", ""Forever My Lady"" to ""Freek N You"" & ""What About Us"".This is a must have for those of you who jammed out to these songs when the originally came out or for those of you who just appreciate good ol' R&B.; Truly a gem!"
5,Stella,"I have this Stella along with 3 other seson 2 dolls (Bloom, Layla, and Flora) and Stella is great. the only downside is I lost her head band. but it is great if you take out her pigtails you can keep the clear bands and put them back in or use plastic wrap to keep the hair held together then slip the orange things back on. I would also like to give a tip: If you can't find winx clothes bratz clothes fit them I use tape to keep them on."
4,More Beautiful Than Last Year's!!!!!!!!!!,"I have the new Stella and I love how she looks! She has eyelashes that feel so real! I also think that her outfit looks like the one from the show! If you bought Stella and she comes with mini Stellas, be careful. I have them and sometimes, the limbs come off.(not on the regular Stella)They don't always come off, but they're easy to put back on!"
4,Cute,"My daughter and I are big Winx Club fans. She is 3 1/2 yrs old and she loves her Stella doll. Some parts were a bit small and since she has a little brother we had to throw some of them away, but she still has a great time with it. We got Flora for her cousin, and we are going to get Layla for her other cousin. The girls love them."
3,gimme something new,"This album would be one of the tightest if it wasn't a bunch of old songs. Yeah, they're good songs but if you have any other cavvy r albums, you'll have allready heard them. Come out with something new and original and maybe I'll buy your next album."
5,Love the price.,This battery was about a third of what I would of paid for in a store. With the same quality as bought directly from the camera shop. Fast delivery!
1,casio np40 battery,"Jan,7,and I still havent received my battery,even after a second one was supposedly shipped.what gives ? Should I just forget about it ?"
3,A hassle to return,"I bought this based on the editorial review that ""All Rösle products are made in Germany"", and I needed a good Germany-made cutter because the Germans are known for their cutting instruments. Now I have this shipped to me, and it is made in China."
2,Disappointed,"I assumed that a silk reproduction of an orchid, from seeing them at friends homes, would look more realistic than this one I purchased through Amazon. It is not nearly delicate enough to fool anyone, so I am quite disappointed."
4,Cymarron,"I had to have this CD for my collection. With songs like ""Rings,"" ""Like Children"" and even ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"" from Bee Gee's fame, it seemed like a must have. In hearing this CD, I am reminded of some of the great songs of the 70's as well as groups worth remembering and listening to. When listening to Cymarron, I realized how much I enjoyed their music and was happy to hear it again. I like the country rock feel of this album."
3,"Nice CD, but I only liked ""Rings.""","I heard the song ""Rings"" back in the 70s and really liked it, but I never bought the single -- yes, there were singles back then called 45s. Ask your parents about them, as well as LPs, rotary telephones and black & white TV. Anyway, 30 years later, my daughter was getting married and I wanted to sing ""Rings"" at her wedding. (Thankfully, my wife talked me out if it.) Too bad Cymarron was a one-hit wonder. I listened to the other songs, but they did nothing for me."
1,What is this?,"This book was so bad simple words cannot describe it. It was predictable, boring, juvenile and just plain bad. The only thing about reading this book that was good was that I never bought it. Do not waste your time with this drivel. Go out and stare at your shoes in the snow. That'd be much more productive."
1,Terrible,"one of the worst items i bought,Irregular size, weird shaped, and low quality.Wont buy, you shouldn't buy it, and in the end i gave it to the salvation army"
2,Too studio'ish,"Sorry guys, but I'm not so impressed by this set. I've found that the sound on these recordings is so studio'ish that it seems fictitious.Chailly doesn't grab me. I see what his Mahler is about. I find him too fake, and overtly pompous...a man born for the studio. (Similar to Solti's and Rattle's Mahler.)The playing is quite consummate and the sonics are great but the interpretations offer nothing new to me. (Except No. 4, which is actually the best version I've heard in long time.)Invest your money in a classic set, like Kubelik's or Bernstein's Sony cycle, or if you want a modern digital set, go for Neumann's Mahler with the Czech Phil, or the splendid Koln versions with Gary Bertini on EMI."
5,Born to peel,"This product exceeded my expectations - which were already very high going in, based upon the reviews here. It takes nothing more than its own weight - no pressure from you at all (in fact, some negative pressure may be warranted)- to produce the thinnest possible peel and save the most of the vegetable or fruit from the garbage disposal or compost pile. (As one reviewer noted, it really does ""glide"" through the task.)This is one of those products just pricey enough to inspire guilt and cause anticipatory buyer's remorse in some. Please, don't let that get to you. Just buy this and you'll feel proud of yourself and may actually have some fun performing what is, after all, a pretty drudgerous (well, it should be a word) task.It also looks so good it will never see the inside of the drawer but rather will continue to hang in full view in my knife area."
5,The Best,"I've used several cheap peelers and decided to get something of quality. Well, this was it. It works like a charm and peeled many pears recently with no effort at all. Very well designed."
4,Sharp,"Very sharp but sometimes a little difficult to peel a beet at certain angles. It sometimes digs in too deep into the vegetable for peeling and I have to repeel the same vegetable area. But all in all, good peeler."
5,worth the money,"I'd never used a peeler with this design, so I was a little hesitant about buying it. Now that I have it, I've adjusted my technique and like it. The best part about this peeler is how well it peels. It is sharp, and it takes off a very thin layer of peel, which really cuts down on the waste. It easily peels mangoes, potatoes, yams, apples, carrots, etc. It's definitely worth the money in my opinion. I'll never need to buy another peeler; I can just replace the blades."
3,Not particularly overwhelmed by it,"I have had this peeler since January of 2012. I'm not as overwhelmed with it as the other reviewers. I often go back to my inexpensive peeler when this won't quite do the job. And yesterday I used it and it broke - I actually thought that was impossible because it seemed to be made very well. But a screw broke off of it. I've written to Rosle because it has a lifetime warranty. I also have looked for a good peeler, and I'm becoming convinced that the inexpensive ones, replaced every couple years, may be the only good answer."
5,looked great on my honda vtx 1300,looked great on my honda vtx 1300 looked great on my honda vtx 1300 looked great on my honda vtx 1300
4,great purchase,Devil in the Details was delivered in a short amount of time and is in great condition! Recommend this seller to everyone.
3,Obsessing about everything!,"Though this is probably a good review of living with an obsessive compulsive disorder, I found it a bit bizarre. Her family was certainly long-suffering, though it's hard to believe they couldn't have found more help for her."
2,Cute but lacks substance,"Traig is fine with the cute and zany one liners and puns. Found she jumps around so much in the book that one minute she is eight then four then sixteen and now four again. Are we to believe that all these misfiring neurons, as she put it, conveniently realign themselves in time to enjoy a normal adulthood? She says she had OCD since childhood and that we all know now that it has a chemical basis. Was she cured through divine intervention or does she still suffer from OCD. Thats left very unclear. She repeats herself an awful lot(compulsion?)This book could have been much shorter and if had to be as long as it is she could have cleared up the issue of whether and how she suddenly stopped having OCD."
5,Funny and Interesting,"Devil in the Details: Scenes from an Obsessive Girlhood is a very funny memoir recounting Jennifer Traig's own childhood and her struggles with OCD. This book actually made me laugh out loud when I read it. At the same time, I learned a lot about OCD and found her struggle very interesting. I love how Traig can still find humor in her difficult childhood."
4,blue gel paste,"it was smaller than I expected after getting the large brown gel bottle. Perfect color, shipped quickly and packaged well."
1,Oily residue bubbles to the surface,"This will certainly change the color of your food, but when used in a straightforward butter-cream mix in sparing quantity, it bubbled a nasty looking oily brown residue to the surface of the cream and the residue just sat there looking nasty. Will never use this product again."
5,Great For Making Breaking Bad Candy,I bought this because my boyfriend and I wanted to replicate the Breaking Bad *meth* and this color works perfectly! You can make the color darker or lighter as you see fit and the shade either way is great!
1,It's not the product....it's the seller,"I ordered this on December 26th. It is now January 8th, it should have been here yesterday. I'm not understanding why it takes so long to ship from South Carolina to Pennsylvania. I ordered this to make my daughters elmo cake for her 2nd birthday, it's not going to make it on time. I love amazon, but I will never order from this seller again."
2,i should have got the liquid one,"the gel is really annoying i should have got the liquid one because this one takes too long to blend into the food, it eventually does thought it it does work but doesnt blend perfectly"
5,I am an Americolor convert!,"When I learned to decorate cakes over 10 years ago, I learned using Wilton. I love Wilton, I'm a big advocate for all things Wilton. Until now. I am officially an Americolor convert. These colors are so amazingly vibrant! And using them to make paint (with clear vanilla), to paint on fondant and gumpaste is a TREAT. They are some much smoother and easier to use and the colors are so brilliant I doubt I will ever buy Wilton color again. I still love many, many things Wilton - but for color I'm hooked on Americolor!"
1,Not as described,"I love AmeriColor, but instead of receiving the soft gel paste in brown I received AmeriColor Airbrush food color in brown. Not the same thing."
4,Does the job as far as frosting goes...,"I ordered this in anticipation of making my son an x-box cake for his 8th birthday. The cake did indeed look black after mixing this coloring with the chocolate frosting, so I'd say it works. It will also color your tongue bluish but that's just par for the course. My son was happy so even if I wouldn't eat the final product, I'd say it was a success."
5,Worked Great!,I used this product to turn white icing into a nice dark green color for an Alligator cake. I put most of the bottle into the icing and you couldn't even taste it. Several people asked how I was able to get such a great dark green!
5,Good brush,This is a nice pastry brush - one of the better ones I've owned. I would have like the bristles to be a tiny bit longer. But works and cleans up very nicely. One of the best things about it is - it does NOT shed!! :) I'm glad I purchased it.
4,Gloworm is more fun for kids over a year old,"I bought the Gloworm as a gift for my two 8 mo. nieces (The product description claims it is appropriate for 6 mo. to 2 years). After fumbling around a bit to get the batteries installed (it is slightly difficult, but kid-proof once you get the batteries in), both were promptly snatched by my 2 1/2 year and 3 year nieces. They could press the ""glow"" feature - the infants could not. It turned into a great toy for the older girls to play with the younger ones - all of whom thoroughly enjoyed it.Children over a year old will have fun with this toy and I suspect that it will be a cherished possession well past 2 years (at least their uncle hope so!)."
4,eye-stimulating for young children and cuddely,my daughter loves it and her brothers love playing with it to try and make her laugh. Its lots of fun watching all of them and then she has something to keep her company at night.
4,Second Generation,"This is the second generation for this family having Gloworm. I bought one for my daughter's first Christmas and now she is expecting her first child in February. I have bought one for a shower gift. She well remembers her Gloworm, as she had it for a long time, and has said she wants her baby to have one also."
2,Not like it was,"What happened to the soft fleece gloworms? The new ones aren't as soft and cuddely. Infants don't even get attached to it until they're older. I got mine when I was three in 1990, and I have slept with it ever since. It is not a toy, but a sleep buddy for a toddeler."
4,Cute and fun....,"My daughter received this as a present, and she seems to really enjoy the ""glowing"" aspect of it, even though she can't make it ""glow"" herself yet. (She's right around 5 months...I know, the package says 6 mo. and up). It's a very cute toy, though the battery pack seems awfully hard! But, so far, she's very captivated by the Gloworm."
4,Frustation,"The problem I am having with this store and the Babyrus store is that I cannot have the items of my choice shipped to me.They can only be shipped whithin the US.It is a rasttle for me to be always bothering my relatives who live in the US to be purchasing the items and having them later on shipped to me.It would be great if you would start shipping overseas,I would buy a lot more from you. Sincerely, Ivana M. Ferreira"
5,Excellent addition for any Desktop,Nice calendar ! Really fun to know about some facts that you probably (and almost sure) don't know. A great addition to any office desktop and really baseball fan !
3,Not too thrilled with the price...,"My daughter is really into the Barbie as Rapunzel things and she purchased this particular toy with her allowance. (She is 6) The horse is made from a hollow plastic and does not move at all. (The legs do not change position) The carriage hooks onto the horse's saddle, but it does not stay hooked very well and my daughter has to keep on putting it back on. The horse's hair is too long in my opinion. It keeps getting tangled up in the carriage and around the horse's hooves. And, the hair isn't top quality which means you will need to brush it often to keep it under control. It also comes with horseshoes which were too hard for my daughter to put on and they pop off after a while.I liked this toy when it was in the box. It is beautiful and looks very much like the carriage in the movie it is based on.However, for the price, it is not the quality I was expecting. My daughter does play with it, but, I don't expect it to last."
3,Frustraiting for a four year old,My daughter wanted this BADLY for her 4th birthday. She was dissapointed because the horse doesn't move and the carriage keeps coming unhooked from the saddle. She played with it for about 15 minutes before frustration took over and she pretty much ditched it. I don't recommend this for a young child. Skip it and get the enchanted tower!!!
4,Not worth the price...,"Although this is a beautiful toy and my 6 yr old daughter enjoys putting the barbies in it, it does not do much of anything. She received this for her birthday as a gift, I would have rather returned it for something else, but she likes it, so we kept it. However it is definitely not worth [$]. The horse is thin plastic and the carriage is not very sturdy at all. I can't see this lasting too long even with light play. Although is an adorable toy, you may want to think twice about paying that price."
3,A little disappointed...,"""Santa"" brought this to my 5 year old, and we were a little disappointed. The horse & carriage are absolutely beautiful, but the horse does not stay attached to the carriage well, and several pieces have already fallen off. My daughter has barely touched this toy since receiving it. She seems to like the Rapunzel dolls and tower a lot better."
2,Not worth the money!,My daughter thought that the carriage looked like so much fun. What a disappointment when she received it! It's extremely flimsy and falls over everytime she tries to roll the carriage. The reins are constantly falling off and when you replace them it feels like the whole toy will fall apart! This toy now sits in the corner and she doesn't play with it. PLEASE think twice before buying!
2,Disney Princess Carriage,"This is such a poor quality toy. The directions to put it together were incomplete. It is just junk, don't waste your money. The pieces don't fit properly and had to be glued to stay in place."
4,Jabba Glob -- perfect for little terrorists,"A gift for a German friend's kids (it's not available in Europe), this was a huge hit; be forewarned that it requires oversight because of its power to create a wonderful, huge mess of green puke and frogs!"
2,Cute and fun but not so good for holding hay,"Our bunny loves to reach up and play with the dangling bell, but it really doesn't hold hay well - Most of it falls out."
2,Poor quality,I bought 2 of these hay balls for our piggies last week and already the chain has come off of one. The chain was barely welded to the top of the ball instead of being secured with a loop the way our other pet-store-bought hay balls are. Disappointed.
4,its ok,"The picture of the item shows it is blue and that was the whole purpose of buying it from this seller. when it came it was a magenta color, i wasnt very happy with that. I was wanting blue for a reason bc its my sons favorite color and it is for his guiena pig!"
5,Good idea for holding hay for my small finches,"These are fun to have for my small finches. Particularly they don't like to pick hay from floor but with this, the process of picking hay and playing with they ring makes it a fun process for them and it works! They try to build a nest. :)"
3,Decent,"I guess it's decent, depending on the personality of the bunny. Our bunny doesn't really care for it. Also, I find it hard to hold all the hay, which usually ends up on the floor or in the litter of her cage. I left it in the cage as a decoration and when her back touches it and rings the bell she turns around and plays with it a little then forgets it is there. Our bunny likes to chew and dig, so we are trying to get her toys to accommodate her...."
3,Can't say anything bad - I passed - 1st time!!,"Before reading this book, I read Microsoft Press's Implementing and Supporting Windows 95.....twice!! But after reading Exam Cram, I seemed to understand things better. If you understand them, it's a lot easier to remember them. I will buy other Exam Cram products."
2,Mediocre prep tool for the 70-064 exam,"The title says it all. This book is for CRAMING ONLY. DO NOT use it as your sole source of information for the exam. It was a very FAST read. The practice test at the end of the book is just a rehash of the questions found at the end of each chapter, it was useless. The is information in here is good for the exam, but not good enough to pass. This book should only be use in conjunction with another book (perhaps Teach yourself Win 95 in 14 days for MCSE). I passed the exam using these two books and the practice test downlaoded from Microsoft."
2,Don't use this book as your only source preparation,"This book is good for general Windows 95 information, it in no way prepared me for the 70-064 exam. The book was weak in most areas of windows configuration in large corporate settings. Don't use this as your only preparation!"
1,The authors have not taken the 70-64 obviously,I had a least 5 questions that were not even mentioned in the book. I then went and found a copy of the book for 70-63 at Borders and I found they were the exact same!!!! Therefore I am upset at the fact that the authors have not taken the new exam obviously.

2,Not good,"It would better if you used a book that was cheaper, shorter, and more concise for the exam.Get the O'Reily book (MCSE Core exam in a Nutshell)They are the best publishing company and they have much more integrity than these guys.The first of many reasons:THE TECH EDIT THEIR BOOKS BEFORE THEY PUBLISH THEM.Just buy the book and you will see for yourself!!!Good Luck getting your money back from ITP."

2,Good product but super small,This is only good if you have super tiny 4 lb dogs.Not good with 2 10 lb dogs.Way too small for the dogs to enjoy.
4,Dig the bop,Very fine musicians playing Parker tunes in concert.It was a LONG time ago that Charlie Parker walked the earth. Red Rodney (trumpet) played with Parker in the way-back and he is the direct connection on this video. Rodney himself has an interesting life story you should learn about.Good production for Parker and jazz fans of the era.
4,Powerful songs of suffering,"The poems in this collection are powerful and intimate. Although the organization of the book could be tighter, Compo's poem address the devastating effects of AIDS and cancer on patients. Compo brings the reader into the world of the sick and reminds me that beyong our own fear of cancer and AIDS is the power of empathy. When Compo shows me the raw emotions of an woman on the edge of death, I am reminded of life and what it means to live"
1,CRAP,This dvd set is a rip; do not buy half the disc do not work. Some of the disc where in the wrong box. Apparently these were priated in someones garage. See as it was half the price of buying them at a big box store. This is a rip off. DO NOT BUY. VERY UNHAPPY;.(
1,Kindle Edition is a dud,"Countless misspellings, mistranscriptions, meanings of entire sentences lost. No linked footnotes. Format has line numbers that make lines wrap on Kindle screen that shouldn't even at smallest font. Total waste and should be pulled from the store."
4,Great How To Film Production Book!,"I'm just starting to make my own movies and I am unfamiliar with constructing props and I can't believe how much I've learned already from this book already. I'm not handy, but most of the building is easy enough for me to follow. Most of the books I've read gave advice on how to shoot movies, but this is the first one I've seen that focuses on the tools and techniques for actually getting the production work done. The author gives a fantastic overview of almost every area of filmmaking...except for costume and make up :-) Very highly recommended."
4,"Great Compilation, But Missing Logos.","The 5th Garfield Treasury comes recommended from me, but not without a few problems. As most of you know, these more recent treasuries are cutting out the logos and the very first little box. A shame.But, that aside, this book certainly has its laughs. I laughed a lot and this book (as long as you bring along EVERY other Treasury and the black and white books) is great for long car rides. People think Garfield is only for the little kids, but he's for the adults, too. The whole family can laugh at the fat cat's hilarious mischief and his practical jokes on Jon, his hapless owner. Some of the colored Sunday strips are from ""Garfield Rounds Out,"" which is one of my favorite Garfield books. Having them in color here is a real treat. An especially funny strip in this one i where Garfield pretends to be a bird-bath, and gets more than he bargained for.The 5th Garfield Treasury is laugh out loud funny! But then again, what Garfield book isn't?"
2,falling apart from old glue,"It's in poor condition, not good or better. As I read it, the glue let go from the spine and a huge chunk of pages fell out."
1,Disapointed!,"I purchased this item for a family member and give it as a Christmas gift ,little that I knew ,item did not come with all parts .What an emberasement !My advise ""when buying present open first than check if everything there than give"" .Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XLZIMA"
5,exercise bicycle petals,"excellent , sturdy, seen for over $60.00 at other places. Great product, great price."
4,Good product,I love this product. The tension is a little loose for the legs but great for the arms. Also you take smaller strides but that is to be expected because it is smaller than a full size bike. I would recomend this product for anyone looking for a way to excerise while watching t.v.
4,As advertised,it is stable and works as advertised. I would recommend it to friends or family. I use it with arms as well as legs.
3,Good for all ages,"It is good exercise for all ages. My ninety seven year old mother will actually use it, with out the danger of falling. This modle is out of alignment in the base and one peddle. The rubber feet need to be glued on."
2,Instride excercycle,"I thought i would be able to use this in the place of going to the gymn .Oh you can get a workout,because the cycle doesn't stay in place,so you're constantly having to stop and move it back into place,guess you can't expect much for the money.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
5,Love my InStride Cycle XL,"After following the advise for a couple of weeks of a home health physical therapist who did not want me to use this item, my Physician's Assistant told me it was an excellent tool to help me recover from double knee replacement surgery. I can tell a huge difference in the flexibility of my knees after only three days of use, and can now drive my pickup which has a manual transmission. I highly recommend this product."
1,it burned my skin,"I don't understand how this item got 4 star review. when you tighten the screw to increase difficulty level, the steel pedals get so hot that it burned my skin other day. I called Amazon for compensation. But got only advice to return the item and write anything in the review. I got a lesson that four star review at Amazon doesn't really mean anything."
2,MAYBE I NEED ANOTHER ONE BUT...,"WHILE USING THE PRODUCT IT STICKS AS IT TURNS - NOT GIVING ME A TRUE FEELING OF RIDING A BIKE. ALTHOUGH, THE RESISTANCE IS DUE TO TURNING THE KNOB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TUBE, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO GIVE YOU A TRUE VERSION OF EXERCISING. IF THE PRODUCT CAN BE IMPROVED IN RESISTANCE AND SMOOTHNESS OF PEDALING - IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE EFFECTIVE."
4,InStride Cycle is great,Very pleased with this purchase. I bought it for my 85 year old Father to help him keep his legs in shape.
4,Just wish it was a little heavier,"I bought this as a way to get some excersize in at the office. Works pretty good, and It definitely gets my heart pumping - at the right resistance. However, I wish the unit was a little heavier so that it didn't slide as much while I use it. No a big deal, I just have to readjust it a few times. Ir the money, I think it's a great product."
4,Better than doing nothing at all,"I purchased this pedaling system for my mother. She has had trouble getting around lately and was looking for a way to get some exercise. She enjoys being able to stay seated and pedal. Since she started using it, some of her knee pain has gone away and she is starting to feel better. This is a good product for the price, it is sturdy and easy to set up. Definitly a good purchase for someone who needs to get physical activity but is unable to cycle or walk long distances due to injury or other health limitations."
1,JUNK,you get what you pay for. uneven pedaling motion. cheaply manufactured. will not last. not worth one dollar. save your money for something better
5,Great pedaler,"This is a great, stationary pedaler that we purchased for my husband after he had knee surgery. It has a solid frame that is easy to grasp and move around and the tension adjustment is easy. Much better than the one at the local medical supply store with its teeny, lightweight frame, smaller pedals and higher price!"
5,Cute little thing-- effective for its size and shape,"I keep it under my desk for brief workouts when everyone else is elsewhere in the office. It's cute, it's fun and I can take it home on the bus if I want to. I don't expect to get a ""Good burn"" out of this -- but I DO get a nice workout and that's all that matters."
3,works good but,The bike works fine but the stroke of the pedal arms is extremely short. Possibly good for rehab or less active individuals
2,Cycle Excercise,"I got this for my wife, she does not use it because the feet rotate on the unit so will not stay in place."
3,use it for arms,"Same problem with others - the plastic feets are not stable, and not enough resistence. But I'll keep it, I figure I can use it to exercise my arms. It doesn't slip when I put it on a coffee table and pedal with my arms. And the resistence level is OK since arms are not as powerful as legs."
2,Cheap and cheaper,"This product was very unstable, even on carpet. There is no resistance and the caps on the feet kept coming off. Sending it back!"
4,How to avoid squeek and add resistance,"Everyone's claim that this cycle squeeks horribly is true. I'm average weight for a 35 yr old male and I can peddle it while working on the computer with no resistance (no squeek) and you'll get your heart rate up a little bit. I've found that buying one of those exercise rubber bands (the flat wide kind for rehabilitation) and tie one end of a 7-8"" strip to a pedal and fit the other end inside the end cap on the tube and repeat for the other pedal, that it actually adds some decent resistance without any squeek. You can buy the bands on amazon for like 6 bucks. The resistance isn't going to substitute for your spin class or anything but if you're just sitting at your desk for hours pedaling, it makes a difference. Really you can't beat the price so with this little modification its well worth it. You might as well throw that little tension screw it comes with out the window."
4,gets legs moving,My Orthopedic PA told me to purchase one of these to begin PT after a long stint of being bedridden. It worked and after using it a few weeks I was able to advance to standing exercises. I used it without tension so had no overheating problems. This is a good 40 dollar solution for those with limited mobility.
2,Just OK,Does the job for my wife with some modifications. As designed it will not stay put on the floor. I bought a piece of capet mesh to put under the cycle to keep it from moving. Also when you increase the resistance it makes pedeling an uneven jerky type of motion. Overall it will help her until the weather gets good enough to walk outside.
2,Fine if you're Deaf,"You can use this thing for about 30 minutes before it gets too hot and starts to squeak horribly. You can tell it's from overheating because the pedal arms get too hot to touch! We have two of them bought from amazon and we took them apart to see if we could lubricate the mechanism (not easy to do) but with wd40 and lithium grease it still squeaks like you're strangling a goose. The manufacturer has a laughable return policy requiring original packaging, packing slips, paid shipping and mandatory insurance which makes it not worth it to try to return and therefore not worth buying if you are worried about the noise. OTHER than all that, it works fine."
4,It is really a good quick exercise machine.,"Low impact, but will make the burn if you work it. I use it during the summer time when I can't get outside due to the heat. You can sit on the edge of a bed or chair and peddle away in an air conditioned room. Doesn't take up a lot of room to use. It takes a moment to get use to the foot and peddle action, you are not pressing down like on a bike but forward. Great for elderly or someone who is just starting out their routines. You do not need to stand up to use the product. Therefore, not alot of pressure on your knees. Very sturdy, even if you are over 300 lbs, since you are not standing on the machine it will work for you. Can be used under a desk at work, make a little noise. Works on the legs and moves the blood, great for the numb butt. It does not take up much room for storage, about 2'x 2'space. Easy to put together. Not what I recommend for traveling, it is alittle heavy. But a wonderful work out machine to use while listening to your Ipod !!"
3,Short pedal radius,"Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XLI am a senior with compromised leg muscles due to old polio. I hoped this device would provide a simple way to limber up my legs in the morning. However, I discovered that it has a pedal radius of 4"". Normal exercise machines and adult bicycles have pedal radii around 7-8"". Using this machine is like pedaling a kiddie cycle. It gives me some limbering, but not enough range of motion to really do any good."
3,InStride cycle,"I bought this product for my 90 yr old mom who enjoys walking, but often is unable to due to the weather or tiredness. Looking at the product online, I really was not expecting much - just a simple machine for my mom to use occasionally when she is watching TV or otherwise unable to walk.That is exactly what I got. Simple to assemble, simple to use. Anyone would really be hard-pressed to get fit and buff from this machine. Basically it just keeps my mom a little limber in arms and legs and occupy her interest for a few minutes each day.I can see a usefulness in the middle of an office day where you can keep one under your desk and do a modicum of leg exercises to mildly keep your legs toned. That's it.You don't get much and do not expect much. But for what it can do, it's not bad."
3,"Good Cycle, But Slightly Misleading Design","this is a good cycle, but the only thing i don't like about it is that the time counter attached to the bike cannot be reset. this design doesn't seem to make any sense to me. Had I known this, I would have opted for the less expensive version of the bike."
3,Okay for the price,"I was replacing a more expensive exercise cycle and was a bit disappointed with this product. Since it is not really a geared pedal movement, it is a little jerky and difficult to get a smooth motion. The center cylinder does get really hot so would not recommend this for anyone with small children around who might get curious. Considering the price it is an okay product. I have a feeling it won't really last for years, but again that's not so bad with the low cost."
4,Perfect for my needs,"I have completed physical therapy after a torn ACL, and this little machine is perfect to use each morning to keep my knee limber."
5,Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL,I like to get on computer. I put this under my computer table so I can pedal it while surfing the Internet. Save some time on the treadmill.
3,Pretty Good- But not great,"For what you pay and what this is advertized to be, this under the desk cycle is not bad. I have been disappointed with the tension control in particular. Does not seem to give any changes in tension, even when on tightest setting. I have had problems with it slipping quite - and the rubber foot caps seem to flip over more than I'd like. It's okay and not a bad extra to keep us desk-sitters moving a bit."
2,Waiting on Workout?,This product is well built. I put under my desk at work...and after 5 minutes or so it would start squeaking and it has absolutely no resistane. Still looking for a challenge.
3,Great Idea BUT...,I got this to have at my desk during the work week to help stretch my legs and to keep me feeling less winter slug-like. The biggest problem I have is that despite the fact there is a tension twist-it provides no tension. Only get this if you desire no resistance. The assembly was very easy and it is small which is what I wanted BUT I wish it would push back more.
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this machine with high hopes but I just can't make it stop from sliding across the floor when I use it. On multiple occasions, I tried several different ways to stop it from moving away from me or from becoming crooked."
5,Get this!!!,"Buy this one!!! I have ordered two cycles before - the pedal broke off one in a month, and the other was very unstable and scooted forward with every rotation. I was hesitant to try another, but I really needed this type of exercise since I have bad knees. This has been great from the start. Very sturdy and stays put while I cycle. Excellent product, and I'm so glad I gave it a try."
4,Bang For the buck,"Well made, easy to use. Bought for my 80 year old mom to help build muscle tone and stregth in her legs after extended illness. Uses it ll the time."
1,Pedal on over to the garbage can!,"Buyers BEWARE. This is a peice of JUNK. Only buy if you like unsafe, lopsided exercise equipment. After you get it assembled; the front left lifts up before you even try to exercise on it. Then, if you decide to use it just for the arms and put it on the table; the lift is much, much worse--so keep that in mind if you decide to go ahead and waste your hard earned money on this piece of garbage."
4,Pretty Good,"Works well.... Use it as an extra boost..I use it when watching TV, reading a book or talking on the phone. If you have a problem with it slipping, use a non-slip rug pad, makes it much more stable."
1,Do not buy this!,"I read the reviews of this stationary bike and bought despite knowing that minor mechanical problems were common, but I'm fairly handy and previous reviewers provided tips on how to fix the small problems. My bike, however, was so badly made that it simply wasn't repairable. The wholes for the bolts were so poorly drilled that two feet were 1/2 inch off the floor. I will not purchase anything else from this company."
4,exercise cycle,overall good. but the price was just about the same if I had got it at rite aidStamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL
4,Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL,"Great product. Easy to assemble. Fits nicely under a desk. I use this product several times a week as I listen to a variety of webinars in my job. This is a nice way to burn a few calories, keep the blood circulating in my legs, and preventing a blood clot by being non-ambulatory for long periods of time. I would recommend this cycle to anyone who sits for long periods of time at a desk.Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL"
5,Knee replace.,Great exercise tool for a patient after knee surgery. If I could just get my wife to USE it. HELP.
3,Works but nothing revolutionary,Easy to assemble. There is a slight noise issue and the pedals are not adjustable. I wish they were set to accommodate larger feet and maybe change the height. I got this to use at work. It so far works fine but you don't have many options to adjust it. The movement is not as fluid as I would ideally like but it is fairly cheap. You may want to try to test drive a few models in person if you are able. I will be sticking with this model for awhile but will try something different next time.
3,issues with Stamina InStride Cycle,"This would be much better if it had a ""pedometer"" instead of just a timer. Also the rubber feet rotate so the cycle doesn't stay put. The straps need to be bigger so that a man's tennis shoe will fit into the pedal strap."
3,"Ok, but flawed.","The unit came unassembled which isn't a problem but it does take a bit of playing around to get it leveled and even still, the base isn't weighted enough to take any pedaling without wanting to lift up or wobble... The rubber leg caps tend to spin if you push too much which unbalances the pedaling. A heavier base and keyed caps would have made for a much better product."
5,Review of bike,"I found the stamina 15-0120 Instride Cycle XL to be stable, easy to use and reasonablly priced. It is also versatile as one can use both their feet, but also their hands. Prior to purchasing the item, I would like to have known how to hold it in place while I exercise. Now, I have discovered that it fits nicely under my ottoman."
4,good for stroke rehab,"I purchased this product for my father who has had a stroke and sent home quite immobile. We didnt' need anything advanced and I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on this. This item is perfect for his situation and I would recommend it to anyone who has a parent (or loved one) in this situation. I would have given it five stars for the purpose I purchased it, but I had to do some creative adjustments to the straps since they are not adjustable. My father has an orthodic on his foot in addition to his already wide EEE shoe instep. The straps may have worked for a normal size shoe but not for this instance. I cut the strap in the middle, added the extreme-strength adhesive-backed velcro on each side of the strap and made the strap completly adjustable to any size foot/shoe that uses the device. He is using it for both hands and legs excercises."
4,Easy excercise,"I am a diabetic person with leg problems and this little devise helps me to do my necessary exercises, it is very portable and easy to use."
2,Returned the item,This was not stable even on carpet. The tension was also not very adjustable. Seemed cheaply made. The floor grips did not stay in one place. They were always twisting and turning.
2,Sturdy parts but needs QA,"The price was right for this product and the parts are sturdy and plenty strong. The welding was not great though, and the product was mis-aligned which causes it to wobbleClip to attach small plastic timer was also welded about 1/2 too high so that it could not properly attach."
2,ok - not great,"I travel so I purchased this to ""replace"" my biking at home. The first time it would actually tighten down for resistance. After that I would tighten it, but no resistance. Not really worth the money since I don't want to just pedal for nothing."
5,Easy Exerciser,"The Cycle XL is the best exerciser of its type I have used. It was simple to put together; it stores easily; and it's easy to use, just find a comfortable upright chair and you are set to go. It's good quality and good value for the money, too. No more excuses - just use it!"
3,Works great for rehab or disabled person arm workout,"This cycle works great for rehab, but needs to be left to cool before moving. It ships with stickers on it that warn about it heating up and getting hot. I think it needs to be redesigned to not get hot. Putting stickers on it only diminishes the chance of a lawsuit and doesn't fix the problem. It's dangerous for forgetful users that have impaired vision. It is great for an arm workout, but useless for a leg workout on a person with poor leg coordination or foot numbness. I can't give it more than 3 stars because of these points."
4,Nice and Sturdy,The Stamina cycle XL arrived promptly and was easy to set up. I now enjoy cycling comfortably in an arm chair while watching TV. Family members admire the device's utility and appearance. The only drawback is the tendency to slip forward on my tile floor. I solved this by tying the Stamina XL to the legs of the chair. The Stamina Xl seems to substitute nicely for a much more expensive recumbent bike.
2,not so good,"this thing not so great, it gets to hot you can burn your fingers if you try to adjust position, overall not good workout, cant fit under any bed foot not stedy, whole unit not steady...."
2,The foot holders are not adjustable,"It's a good thing the price was not so outrageous because the design is not good. The foot holders are not adjustable so I think maybe a small child could wear shoes and still be able to put their foot in them. The feet that hold the pedal exerciser on the floor are not secured in any way, and since the overall weight is not heavy, it travels when being pedaled."
4,easy rider,"To begin, it is easy to assemble. It is well made, and sturdy. It requires little more than a straight back chair and a level area. Once you adjust the resistance you are off and riding! Whether you use it as a foot or hand pedal, it is easy and enjoyable. Warning: it is an alternative to the full size machine but is fun and effective."
2,"Not very good, would have rather paid more for higher quality","Pros:- It has 2 pedals, and if you exert force they will turnCons:- Too tall for many desks- Jerky feedback, very inconsistent pressure, sticky even- Does not ""feel"" like a bike or elliptical at all...feels gimmicky and cheapSpend more $ and buy a better unit. This one is pretty bad."
4,Not bad at all,"I've recently had surgery on both knees and needed wanted a cycle that I could use at my desk. It does it hot when you cycle fast or for a long time, but that's what I needed. Thirty (30) minutes of cycling and my knees felt better, although I had to stretch afterwards. It gives my knees a decent workout.The one thing I wished it had are better floor grips. The cycle floor grips roll over sometimes when cycling fast or when the tension is increased to its highest level. They should have been built into the cycle instead of grips that can be removed.Overall, it works for what I need and what my doctor recommended (using a cycle for my knees so as to have a no impact solution)."
1,Quality has taken a nose dive,"This was the second time that I bought this model. The first one I bought held up for a long time, so when the pedal broke off I had no complaints. This time I was never able to adjust the tension as I'd been able to do with the original one I owned. There were horrible squeaks at first, but I wrote that off as an adjustment period. But when the squeaking stopped, there was still no appreciable difference between the lightest & heaviest setting. And then -- the fastener for the pedal broke and it became a piece of junk. I had used it for less than 1 month when that happened.This is a very convenient way for apartment dwellers to get indoor exercise since it takes up so little space. I wish I knew of a similar product at a similar cost that was more reliable."
3,Cheap but useful,"This item was received in okay order, was easy to assemble. It overheated and started squeaking about 20 minutes into the workout. You don't break a sweat, but it is pretty good for making one feel like they are doing something useful while watching the 'tube or surfing the 'net."
1,This is a dangerous item,"I purchased this item because I have a permanent back injury from a car accident, and it makes it very hard for me to exercise regularly, so I thought this would be just the thing for me.I used it for only 15 minutes, with the tension turned up, and when I went to pull my foot out of the strap, I was VERY badly burned. The entire inside of my foot has a nasty burn on it, and when I checked the unit, the pedals and the central unit where you adjust the tension were all scalding hot. After more than 45 minutes, they are still hot to the touch.If you are planning to use this item with any tension at all, do not choose this one, this is a VERY DANGEROUS piece of equipment."
2,Better for Arm Exercise,"This is a good idea, but overall it is difficult to use. You need to prop the cycle against a wall to keep it from sliding (the rubber feet do not hold). Also, you cannot maintain a cycling pattern, as it has a herky-jerky movement from the start; you keep having to stop and start in a futile attempt to get up to a consistent speed. It also overheats within a few minutes (you can burn your hand if you grab it at this point). The only viable use is to place the cycle on a table and use it for arm exercise. It has some utility here.I might have used it more if it could be pedaled in a more fluid manner, but it is impossible. You would be much better off just going to a stationary bike."
1,Not stable,"Not a good product and not worth for money.It is really diffucult to use.You need to ask someone to hold the instrument ,If you really want to do exercise."
1,Poor Quality Product,"I used this product three times, about 20 minutes each, before the right peddle slipped off the metal arm. Something inside where they connect was broken. The product is unrepairable. Apparently Amazon won't refund me, neither will the manufacturer (though I did register the product for warranty). I would recommend purchasing something else. This is the definition of poor quality! It also makes noise and slides on the carpet. Fortunately, it never overheated on me."
1,stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL,"I was unhappy with this product because it did not perform as described. It slipped on carpeting; the tension could not be properly adjusted; and after a very short time of use, the pedals made a very annoying and almost continuous squeaking which was not abated with oil. Furthermore, the use for arms was even more unsatisfactory, in my husband's and my opinion."
4,Great Product that can be used at home or at work!!!,"Due to the time I spend driving and sitting in front of a computer, I wanted to find a way to incorporate daily exercise into the routing tasks I had to accomplish every day. This is a great device. While I am on the phone I pedal, while I work I pedal, it fits in the car and is lightweight. The only negative I have is that the center pedal mechanism gets very hot after use. I mean very very, fry an egg hot. As long as you keep this in mind this a product that is worth the purchase."
2,Little resistance,"I bought this to have at work to use to keep my legs going as i sit for long periods of time, i am by no ,means in shape, 6'4 and 220lbs, with the tension screw all the way down, this offers almost no resistance.Also the cheap plastic feet are useless on any tile floor, the machine just slides and moves around far too much, i would think they could of afforded to use real rubber feet and not harden plastic."
2,"It's not a smooth rotation, and the more tension you put on it the rotation is nonexistent. Do not waste your money","It's not a smooth rotation, and the more tension you put on it the rotation is nonexistent. Do not waste your money"
4,Cycling at home,"I've been having problems walking and therefore, don't get proper exercise. The Stamina InStride Cycle helps me with this. I can sit and cycle. I am still comfortable but can get some exercise. It's great. It was easy to put together and simple to use. I haven't tried the arm exercises yet but that looks interesting too."
1,Annoying to peddle!,"I bought this cycle to use while I was recovering from a knee injury this summer. Everytime I used it, my feet would hit the edge of it and it was very annoying. It was easy to set up though but overall, I am not happy with it. I am returning it to amazon for a refund and will be joining a gym instead."
5,Simple but efficient,It's small and doesn't cost much but it does the job. My wife had a serious ankle sprain and the doctor recommended it for therapy.
3,You get what you pay for.,"The ""high tech electronic display"" is nothing more than the cheapest digital timer you can imagine. While the base is sturdy and the pedal mechanism works easily, I'm wondering how long the cheap plastic foot straps will last. I'm less than 5 feet tall, and was concerned about the pedaler being too tall to use from the couch. No problems there. Otherwise, I think this particular pedaler is about as good as they get. They're not meant to be spectacular."
2,Stamina Cycle Review,"The product was not all that I had hoped. I had hoped that it was a stand-up device. I really couldn't tell by looking at it online. Additionally, the top piece, the gear, was put on irregularly, i.e., the right side drags the floor. Disappointing, to say the least."
3,Okay Cycler,I bought this for under my desk at work. It moves quite a bit and my office chair rolls.
4,just recieved this and so far it seems to work just fine...I guess I will find out more as I use it.,"i just recieved this, so only time will tell. So far as of today, it seems to be ok."
1,I give this product 0 stars,"I live a sedentary lifestyle. I bought this to get a little exercise, after reading that it wasn't much exercise but might be good for someone who was sedentary. That'd be me. Thing is, I took it out of it's box in the kitchen, then since my friend was sitting in the living room, I decided to put it together in there. The right pedal fell off while i was carrying it. Looked at the broken part, and i kid you not there was rust on it. so i got a refund and bought yarn. i am trying to find other ways to help myself not be sedentary. i've started doing some walking. it's free."
2,Item Itself is Sub-Par,"First of all, the cycle is so light that you have to have it against the wall otherwise it will slide around. This would be no big deal if the stoppers on the end of each pole didn't come off constantly regardless of whether it was against a wall (I have half a mind to hot glue them). Also, the bike doesn't really have any way to increase or decrease the intensity of the pedaling. I think the T-bolt at the top is meant to do that, but it doesn't. Lastly, when you use the cycle for about ten minutes, the metal rods that hold the pedals get scorching hot. There is a warning on it that says (CAUTION - HOT SURFACE) but it seems to me like a major design flaw. Overall, not what I expected, and not worth the money I paid for it."
3,OK,"Like others said - there is not much tension on this small bike. Also, if you have the tension turned up at all the pedals will squeak LOUDLY. It also slides all over the floor so you have to put it up against something sturdy to use it. I don't know how to remidy any of these problems except buy a different bike. If you want a bike that will help to just move your arms or legs this will work. If you want something that will actually strengthen your arms and legs with tension this will not do it."
4,I'm happy with it!,"bought this cycle coz it was the shortest in height i could find, but still doesn't fit under my desk at work. I pull it out from under the desk and use it--i'm satisfied ; had knee surgery lately and it gets stiff sitting at my desk.I use it about 3x a day for 5 min or so and it loosens my knee up nicely."
3,Maybe be better for physical therapy or people who can't make it outside.,"Its ok for just a slow steady session. If you try to make the unit use more resistance the metal gets hot an can burn if you touch it, even after you finish. I used it for about 15 minutes add noticed I had to keep adjusting it to stay underneath my feet, it kept sliding. It will work if you don't use too much resistance and if all you are looking to do is keep those joints moving this is great but I was looking for something to stay active on days I couldn't make it to the gym or park. I'll be giving it to my grandma."
3,difficult,"I found this difficult to use. It is not smooth peddling. I am tall and sitting in the chair using it, my knees are under my chin. If I had to buy it again I would not."
3,good,"Good for the price. Does what i wanted and expected. It does get warm when used and you have to let it cool down to move it. Easy to use, and store in a small living area."
5,Exercise,I purchased the Instride Cycle for my mom to use to strengthen her arms and leg muscles. It's great for older adults that don't get very much exercise. I'm very pleased with it and so is she.
3,Instride review,I like the product and it is good for the price although I would have liked to see it a little more durable especially in the main bearing area. It will serve my purposes of 10 to 20 minutes of use every day quite well I believe.
1,OK I am sold!,"I read every single review that has been written about this equipment. 1-We often are traveling in a motor home, 2- my husband is recovering from knee replacement surgery, and needs to keep his knees flexible, 3- I am diabetic and occassionally need to ""work off"" a high blood sugar, 4- I have arthritis and have gotten weak because pain make moving difficult. For these reasons I had been considering getting this very cycle.I am ordering it today! I have learned from the reviews that people using this cycle are benefitting from many more problems than I ever thought about. How can we lose? Amazon's price is the best, their shipping is the quickest, shipping costs are less, So what's to lose? Will let you know later how we like it."
5,this works great,the stamina cycle works great I got it for my elderly parents that need the exercise and this works well I got another one for me and my husband Now you do have to use them to get the best work out I also was stroner than the other I have used
4,hand and leg exercise,Looked at several similar items. This is for an elderly person just out of the hospital. This is better than the competitors items. Would recommend highly.
4,good for rehab,"The In Stride cycle XL was a good choice for my husband who suffers from COPD. After 8 months on a respirator, he needed to continue his pulmonary rehab at home. The cycle is small, sturdy and portable. The cycle is not too strenuous, but still provides the needed exercise. The tension is adjustable and good for upper body as well as lower. It is a good alternative for someone that can't go to a gym or doesn't have the space for a stationery bike"
3,Not very effective,The pedals keep flipping over so its difficult to place your feet in them. I ended up returning it because I didn't find it useful.
2,Good product but not what I needed.,I would recommend to someone who had better balance but it was too wobbly and light weight for the person I bought it for.
3,stamina,"I wish this were sturdier. It ""travels"" while I am using it. The tension knob came off the first time I used it. It's OK, but I would like it to be better than OK."
2,No timer,"I got this for a Christmas present. when we opened it and tried putting it together. you CAN NOT put on the timer. the one and only stationary part (the wheels) they shipped assembled is right on top of the spot where you are to slide the part into- THERE NO WAY THAT CAN GO! they need to lower it at least a inch or more, I am so disappointed i gave a defective gift."
4,Good,I use it to work my arms and legs. Although it has 'feet' when on the floor it tends to slide a little
3,"good idea, awkward underdesk","easy assembly, finding it very awkward under my desk to peddle. slides on a carpet my knees are hitting the bottom of my desk . caps are slipping off."
2,Cycle,Purchased this cycle to help elderly family member to regain strength in their legs. I don't like it because it is hard for them to maneuver. It does not stay in place on the floor.
2,"Jerky Pedal Movements, Not Smooth Motion","The pedal motion is not smooth, it has a jerky, rickety feel. Unfortunately, I'll be returning it. Also, the whole device is so lightweight that it doesn't stay put on the floor while using it. It has plastic ""feet"" which are meant to keep it flat on the floor while you are pedaling, however, they don't work very well. The whole thing moves around after only a minute of pedaling, which is really annoying. Oh well, back to the drawing board."
2,Instride Cycle,The cycle broke within a few minutes of my using it. I will be contacting the company for a replacement part because packing it and returning it is a cumbersome task.
1,Listen to the poor reviews on this one!,"The price was so good on this one, I just had to go with the positive reviews and ignore the negative ones. Big mistake! All of those bad qualities? Absolutely true! You get what you pay for with this mini-cycle. I'm returning mine. It really doesn't deserve even 1 star."
1,Stamina 15-0120 InStride Cycle XL,"THIS PRODUCT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR MY 85 YEAR-OLD MOTHER TO USE BECAUSE THE STIRRUPS ARE NEVER IN POSITION FOR EASY USE. SHE STRUGGLES REACHING DOWN TO HER FEET TO FIT THE STIRRUPS ON. ALSO, THIS CYCLE TRAVELS--IT NEVER STAYS PUT WHEN IN USE."
3,Great product in certain situations,"I would love to own the desk that you can sit at and not knock your knees against while pedaling. That being said, I have no issue with the sliding, I use a back up power supply under my desk so it spaces perfectly next to the wall and doesn't move about. Any box that is more than 20 lbs will keep it in place. The noise is only if you pedal really fast and hard which I don't think is the purpose of this unit. It is bigger than you think so stowing is a little more noticeable than I'd like. For my situation it is the perfect unit, I use it at work whenever I'm sorting through papers or checking email and then I bring it home and pedal a few hours while I watch TV."
3,Not quiet enough for office use.,"This product is decent in theory, but not so good in practice, especially when it comes to office use. The product makes a squeaking noise during use. For this reason, I was unable to use it at work while working because the squeaking noise disturbed my colleagues. Also, it feels like the peddling motion is uneven, making peddling using this product kind of clunky and awkward. With that said, it is probably good for use at home, just not around other people who are trying to work.I for one, intend to return this product and purchase a better quality product with a smoother range of motion and quieter operation."
3,Not as good as expected.,You have to crank down the tension screw extremely hard to get any resistance in the pedals. Its real bad at scooting across the floor.
4,Disapointed with timer,"I'm pleased with the instride cycle over all, but disapointed that the second or third time I used it I hit the timmer with my foot wile tying to place my feet in the straps and broke the times off. I can still use it but it will not go back on the cycle. Other than that the price was a good deal, I priced them in different places.Kathleen"
2,Not really what I had hoped for,"So I understand that this isn't going to give an intense workout, but I figured it might be worth a try for just sitting at a desk and working at a computer. I had hoped to get a little exercise during times when I would otherwise be sedentary. Well, it wasn't quite what I had hoped. It really won't give you much of a workout at all. It is difficult to use since there isn't anything holding it down. It also gets extremely hot. Had to return it."
1,I can't believe anyone rated this positively,"I ordered this after reading all the great reviews, and it is total garbage. Sorry, I rarely write negative reviews but this is just a pile of junk. The bolts came loose right away, you can't adjust the pedal straps (my foot barely fit) The tensioner is nothing but a screw-tightener that barely works. The stopwatch can't be reset. Reviewers said this fit nicely under a desk, I bought it to use at work and not only does it slip all over the carpet, but I would almost have to be lying down to use it under a desk. i apologize, but I am giving this one star and that's generous."
1,Not so good,"I bought these (ATN 7x30RF Omega Series Binoculars) because I wanted a lighter weight pair and thought the range finding feature would be nice to have.Well, I had to send them back and get a refund. As it turns out the binoculars were unable to focus the left and right view into one image. (And, it wasn't just me, as I had a couple of other people look through them.) This will give you a headache, and I'm not prone to headaches, in just about 15 seconds flat. This made the pair I received absolutely unusable. Obviously, quality control is lacking as there is no way that anyone could have passed these if they had looked through them.The image through each of the sides separately was acceptable, although no better than the much heavier and older (as in WWII old), but still serviceable, binoculars I've had for decades."
3,Colloquial Hungarian,Listening to the tape and trying to follow in the book is difficult. The conversations are very rapid and perhaps this is better for someone who already has the fundamentals down.
3,Good at first!,I've been using this book as my main language learning vehicle for over two years.After losing my first instructor and a several month delay I started over again.The first 100 pages or so goes pretty fast and then the book seems to both changegears and become increasingly difficult. You really have to want to learn Hungarianto get much past this point. I have found it useful but I also find myself looking for another solution. I find no excuse for the many spelling errors in a languagebook.
4,"Goooood, but could be a little more practical","I've got to admit, the book is great, the text is follow-able after listening to the dialogs a couple of times, but it could have been a little more conversational, implementing more basic expressions, and the grammar could be more thoroughly organized.As with the Routledge series, they're not very big on extra dialog material (those without previous knowledge of the language are somewhat at a loss) as for two CD's could hold a lot more spoken dialog than they do.The conversations were fun and upbeat and the book itself is very well written, only flaw is that it could have been a little more ""basic""."
2,was way too complicated for our purposes,"it was supposed to be ""colloquial"" but was very complicated for our eight college students to use. They attempted pre-study and also did some work during our orientation, but even the Hungarian-speaking leader found it extremely difficult to grasp. we are looking for something better now."
3,Good Machine; High maintence cost,"The purifier is fine and does the job, but as for the maintnence cost, the hepa filters cost around $80 a piece and you need to replace those every year. Also the cabon filters are around $20-25 for a years suppy. Buyer should be aware that if you run your purifier year round like I do that there is an annual upkeep cost of $100 plus whatever energy consumption you use for the year."
4,Dark and Troubled... and yet... positive!,"Pat Ortman's music can best be described as dealing with darkness without allowing the dark things in life overtake you. This is probably the best independent debut CD I've heard in 2 years, and I'm looking forward to hearing more."
5,Big Guitars Sing!,"In 1994 I worked at the Illinois Entertainer. I came across Pat Ortman's very first demo tape. It was OK, for a homemade cassette. It was raw, and he was really young and green back then. I tossed it in a pile.Flash forward to 2002, and I get a call from an old friend from a Chicago radio station. Evidently, this new Pat Ortman CD is out and it's getting played and requested. Hey, Pat- congratulations and it's good to hear what happened when you grew up. My favorite tracks are: Tomorrow IS Never Going To Be Your Fault and All Must Go To Sleep. Rock on!"
3,Survivors give their accounts - but on home video quality,"The Last Stand is a poor quality DVD, but does include very rare photos and movies of the ship, sometimes without annoying titles popping up over them. The audio is terrible, so just put your TV on mute until the survivors come on.Otto Schwartz, Dutch Kooper and other USS Houston sailors, at the time in their later years, are featured in the DVD. Buy this DVD for the interviews, if you buy it. ""The Last Battle Station"" by Schultz and ""The Ghost that Died at Sunda Strait"" by Winslow are my recommended reading on the USS Houston. Winslow also wrote ""The Fleet the Gods Forgot"" as a perspective on the action in the Phillipines in the late months of 1941 and early months of 1942.For my money, considering all the material available on the USS Houston in the Cruiser Houston collection at the University of Houston, and in the US archives, this DVD was a dissappointment."
4,Does't Set You Free,"A power adapter is absolutely necessary, especially for an 8"" Nexstar SE, as otherwise the internal batteries will die quickly, leaving you with a useless scope. And this adaptor will give you plenty of power. However, you need to be hooked into an AC outlet, which means you had better have this available when you are out in the field, which of course is not always possible. I recommend buying the car battery adapter, which you can run either off the lighter socket of your car or a portable battery."
4,Super,"The reviews written below by those who purchased it, were most helpful. None of the sigers are familiar on this DVD, and since this is one of my favorite operas, I wanted a DVD. I have the Sutherland, Caballe, Pavarotti cd, which can never be equalled, but I only saw the actual production once. Thanks for the comments, it helped me to decide to buy it. Super is the word. Very enjoyable to watch and hear, eventhough there is no notable scenery. I would recommend it for purchase, eventhough the OPERA TODAY review is not outstanding."
4,Worth watching.,"I enjoyed this Norma. Since I learned Norma by listening to the Maria Callas versions, I was prepared to not like it, but went by the critics recommendations and bought it and I am not sorry. There are more famous people who have done it, but I rejected them out of hand because I didn't think they were visually in the part (Montserrat Caballe, Joan Sutherland) or just not up to it vocally. I thought both the female voices were excellent and Norma was really good, both as an expressive actress and as a singer. I think the Pollione was very inadequate, and why both of these females should be so wowed by him is beyond me. So definitely worth a look."
2,Not a true Norma,"I think people should stick with the Norma from L'Orange with Caballe if they want a DVD of Norma. Caballe was a true Norma. Cedolins tries hard, but I think she fails vocally. She looks and acts the part reasonably well, but this is not bel canto singing. The production is interesting, but the only singer that sounds like she is up to her role is Sonia Ganassi as Adalgisa."
5,The best Norma,"The superb voice by the most beautiful primadonna.I have Thutherland's one too,but she is too ugly.Now is the visual era,so Primadonna has to beautiful like Cedlins,Gheorghiu,Dessi and Netrebko.As for information,I am bisexual.LOL"
3,If you like your Norma sounding like Tosca....yes?,"For those whom Puccini is considered as Bel Canto as Bellini, this Norma is for you. Indeed you might quite enjoy it, and think highly of it (evident from the previous reviews). However, Only Ganassi is recognizably Bellinian. Cedolins' coloratura, contrary to what other reviews said, is smudgy at best, and her phrasing is distorted. But recording is nonetheless no worse than those by Papian or Dessi, and does not stand up to comparison with the great and respectable Normas of the past - Callas, Sutherland, Caballe, even Scotto, Gencer, Deutekom, Bumbry, Verrett and Elinor Ross."
2,Forget it as a pronuciation guide,"If you need a reference for pronunciation ofwords like 'So' and 'Informaes',This is not your dictionary!Dipthong pronunciation seems to havebeen completely overlooked in thisdictionary.(Dipthongs are two letter combinationswith a unique sound)"
5,great book,"Great Poet.you will be in Rome ,may watchJulian the apostate,pagan priests,rise ofchristianity crushing the thought that wasrich and ripe;( because of what whole westwallowed wantonly in the obscure mud for1500 yrs until the wake of renaisance.)there are beautiful poems otherthandepicting ancient times alone."
3,Often Boring,"I had some hope that I would find a new funny author, and it didnt quite happen. It's kind of like a Danielle Steele for the moms-lit crowd. Just Tolerable. The Zoe journals? Horrendously boring.The characters were unbelievable and why is Claire even in the social circle she was? She would more likely be living in the projects and using any private school tuition towards rent if she was truly earning min wage in NYC.I dropped this book midway and read The Glass Castle (good read!) but then I was out of books and went back and finished this. It picked up a bit towards the end in a predictable happy way.Lets put it this way, I think the author could write a good book if she made some adjustments, there are sparks of talent, but this was a so-so read."
1,Boring and impossible,"I thought this book was very, very boring. I didn't really care for any of the characters, and I didn't once see Claire attempt to make the ex-husband more involved in the child's life. Also, what second-grader writes journal entries that are pages and pages long? I know Zoe is a kid, but she acted like a spoiled brat for the majority of the book. I found myself skipping her journal entries (out of sheer boredom and disbelief) and then I started to eventually skip Mia's as well. When I was left with just Claire, I tossed the book aside. I ususally love these types of books, but this one tried too hard to be something it was not, and the characters were pretty unlikeable."
3,TOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Predictible,"Very Predictible, and a little to contrived.The daughter, Zoe, was a brat and written in a way that made it easy to dislike her, and my how advanced she was for a second grader. Just not believable and not much of a plot either.Check out ""The Ivy Chronicles"" instead!"
2,Not for me,A lot seems over-the-top to me - do NY schools really put that much pressure on 6yos? The story sort of combines romance and comedy but the comedy often seems strained (as in tearful children).
5,This is anice book for a begginer!!!,I am 14 years old boy from israel who likes knights and this book was my school progect. And what you know this book helped alot there are simple explanations about knights and castles there are even pictures.So my opinion this is very good book!!!
4,Good Reference,"This is a great reference for people who just want the basics on knights and castles. I gave it a 4 star because it really needed a bit more to it in terms of illustrations. Otherwise, very good and easy to understand, unlike a lot of works written by historians."
2,christian songs,"I like the songs not the singers .they r okay but not great,some of those songs r not very good"
1,"Does not fit 42"" Sylvania","I was very disappointed, did not fit the 42"" Sylvania 8"" short. Stuck with something I cannot use"
5,great wall mount,"easy to install and will hold the tv firm and stable, makes the tv look even better."
4,pluses & minuses,"Basically a good unit at a good price. However, with Samsung 32"" TV, unit mounts so close to the wall that there is no room for TV plug (which is large and protrudes vertically from wall) to fit behind unit; it was necessary to recess the plug (same for HDMI cable, which is easier). Also, needed to use spacers to move unit further from wall; spacers, according to instructions, are not needed for 32"" Samsung TV. So, good unit, as long as you are flexible & creative enough to work around issues like these. Face of TV ended up 5 inches from wall instead of planned 4.5 inches."
3,Check with Peerless before purchasing,"Even though the size of my televison fit well within the stated range of this wall mount, when it arrived, it didn't fit (so it is NOT 'universal' as stated).I went to [...] and found out that I needed the next size larger to fit my 37"" Panasonic plasma.The unit itself looks sturdy and I'm sure it will do the job for the correct sized televison. So check with Peerless before going through the trouble of ordering the wrong size mount and then having to exchange it!"
4,Works great.,"This works fine for an Akai LCD2701TD, except the screws included don't fit. Otherwise, it's simple to install, and relatively cheap."
1,Very Misleading!!,"Product claims to fit tv's up to 46"", though didnt fit my 42"" Panasonic Plasma. First off, I had to go to Home Depot and buy the proper (metric and allen head) bolts that fit the TV because the other 22 sets of hardware were too small (that was another $6 and wasted hour of my life). THEN I had to redrill the holes bec the the bolts were too big for the holes in the frame. Soooo, its probably less of a headache to just go to Best Buy and save yourself the time (especially if you arent inclined to do such alterations as I did). Good luck."
2,Not so Universal,"This mount will NOT work with the Vizio flat screens. Otherwise it seemed to be an unobtrusive, sturdy mount. Of course I never got it on the wall/TV to test that theory."
2,Definately naught Johnny Depp-esque,"Wha' be it like ya ask? 'tis nigh bu' lame, laborous, laffable..Shoulda been made fer TV, then pre-empted by C-SPAN.. Corbin Bernson 'twas better in Major League, an' tha' charactor sucked.. Think o' this as Space Camp, without a plot, storyline, direction or Producer cuts.. th' entire movie shoulda ended on th' cuttin' room floor an' th' cast been marooned on a desert isle an' made ta watch this stinker savvy? Only redeemin' features be th' two wenchbabes in this stinker, AnnaLisa an' Princess Elizabeth.If ya has 90 minutes of yer life ya nigh be needin' anymore, rent' it would be bad enuff.. A teen-piratey-love story.. sorta..."
5,Miss Thang is hot!!!,"Please, don't sleep on this book! It was all that. One of the best books I've read in 2005! I had been trying to get this book for about 6 months, and it was a good read. I am looking forward to Mr. Green's next novel. I won't tell the story, but you won't be able to put this one down!!"
5,soothing and relaxing scent,"Lollia Life is Margot Elena's top-end brand. I first received it as a birthday gift and then bought again for myself. It's definitely 'relaxing' as the title describes. I would recommend it to anyone. (If you're looking for something slightly more affordable, try Margot Elena's mid-end brand, Tokyo Milk.)"
4,Emotionally Satisfying?,"I totally agree with Mrs Lani Keane from Australia that this movie is very depressing and that the schoolboy character is a total brat...However, this movie did have many redeeming factors, such as an interesting glimpse of life in modern day China and beautiful cinematography. But the sadness of it has been with me for days and has almost made me wish I hadn't seen the movie. Perhaps the intense emotions that this movie evokes is an indication of a well-made film."
3,A very pleasing effort.,"This film is well worth your time if you enjoy a good indy flick. If not, stay as far from this movie as possible. You will probably kill yourself if you don't like slow films with little to no explosives.Our plot surrounds the lives of two young boys. Living in China, the most practical mode of travel is by bicycle, and both boys, althought living in different societal environments, crave a good bike like American teens crave a good car. When one of the boys steals the other's bike, conflict quickly follows and we see the dire desperation fall on both the young men as they outwardly show an indomitable necessity to have ownership of the bicycle - something so trivial to most, but something that becomes the object of life and death for both of the boys.I really enjoyed Beijing Bicycle. It is a clean film with subtitles that will probably intrigue viewers if they let it."
5,A wonderfully authentic thought provoking movie,This is a wonderful story of a chinese migrant kid who moves from the village to Beijing to find a job and all the problems that come with it. This story revolves around his bicycle - essentially. I really enjoyed this movie for it's innocence and authentic feel. This is for one of those days when Hollywood just does not feel right and you need a highly refreshing change. I hope this movie wins some awards and is definitely going on my 'must watch' list.
1,"Choose quality, choose Zhang Yimou","As opposed to films which invoke the viewer to question consciousness and worth based on their quality of film making and story, ""Bejing Bicycle"" is one of those pictures where the viewer is forced to find a deeper meaning 'within' because the movie is simply lacking plot, character, and integrity. If the director was trying to call upon the viewers empathy - this was another failure on his part linked to Bejing Bicycle. After the third time the bicycle is stolen - come on already - you start to watch the clock. If you're looking for a quality film which provokes thought and real dialogue, look no further then Zhang Yimou. This is the kind of directing I believe Xiaoshuai Wang was going for in ""Bejing Bicycle"" but fail short of the mark."
2,Annoying,"While this film is very beautifully made I found it quite simply irritating. Rather than feeling sorry for the main character's misfortunes, after nearly two hours of watching him trying to get his bicycle back, I couldn't help feeling at least a certain degree of satisfaction in the scene were he gets the s**t kicked out of him.It didn't seem like it was anything special about contemporary Chinese society that was responsible for his downfall (bicycles, are stolen all over the world) but his own naive personality and his utterly fustrating lack of ability to communicate with anyone. Furthermore, one part of the film did somewhat resemble BMX Bandits.I would however recommed Lao She's excellent book The Rickshaw Boy that this film is based upon, about a country boy in the 1930s who goes to Beijing to make a living in the Rickshaw business."
3,Plagiarist?????,"This film is well done but I cannot bring myself to give it higher marks for one reason...it is quite obviously plagiarizingthe Italian classic by De Sica, ""Ladro da Bicicletta"". Had the director made some admission of this fact on the DVD cover, I would have felt better about the film (maybe he has done so elsewhere). If he has, I would then be quite happy to withdraw my criticism.Thomas Seay"
3,Not what I wanted.,"Well made and nice leather but the clip sticks out, is visible through pants and hooks everything. I bought a Bosca with a magnetic clip which is perfect."
4,subtle yet outspoken,"i am purple plum in the face no one has offered a review of this album. it isn't epic or flawless but it merits permanence to any music enthusiasts archive. the guitar work and lyrics are subtle yet outspoken. the disc opens with a catchy lo-fi graveled track and drifts into the hypnotic ""on the way down."" ""mrs. pilling"" could easily be mistaken for something from a lost donovan archive, and the last track is a pleasant cover of the beatles ""girl."" ""canned laughter"" is a bouncy little number (as are several others). however a few of the later tracks feel like fillers until ""ties"" arrives and once again you are roped in by the hum-along toe-tap melody. essentialy it is pleasing album, a little on the poppy side but without the offense of being tagged ""billboard."" a great album for chilling or filling the islands of time."
5,Lisa,A beautifully portrayed life of a beautiful Saint. Jennifer Jones plays on camera with a purity of nature that I found captivating! EXCELLENT!
5,2 thumbs up,A really great movie for the believer. And she is still just as beautiful today as she was back then. All the Glory to our Lord!
5,The Song Of Bernadette,The DVD was a gift for an elderly relation. She couldn't find it anywhere and I said that I'd order it over the Internet. She is thrilled with it.Your service is amazing - I had delivery within 7-10 days.
1,Faulty DVD,"I purchased ""Song of Bernadette"" from Movie Mars as a Christmas gift to my wife. What a mistake that was. The DVD would not work in any of my DVD players. It said something about area restriction code, or some such nonsense. I did receive my money back from Amazon; however, I sent Movie Mars an e-mail asking them why the DVD was either blank or just would not play. They forwarded me some standard reply that did not answer any of my specific questions I had asked them. I consider that a run-around, and was neither pleased, nor satisfied at all with their response. What can a person do. That's no way to treat a respectable customer!! So, beware of Movie Mars! They have a 95%-rating at the moment; and by the way they treated me, I'm sure that number will continue to drop!"
4,Informative,"This video covers the time period from when Bernadette first saw her vision of Mary until her death a few years later. It was very helpful in writing a saint report for Catholic confirmation, and it was also interesting to watch...a little long, but worth it."
5,One of the best,"I recently saw this movie again and think it is a beautifully made film. Her performance couldn't be bettered. I can't imagine any other actress from the time doing it. There is not a false note to it. I think it is one of the classic film performances. The truthfulness and the simplicity are just remarkable. The cast that surrounds it is just top notch from Anne Revere to Gladys Cooper among others. Plus it is a beautifully photographed film. There are many shots that could stand alone as photographs on your wall. And the score is simply wonderful. This is a very satisfying and moving film that holds up after repeated viewings. If she could win only one Oscar, she got it for the right one."
2,video,"It took a long time for the dvd to arrive.It's a poor quality dvd, i can only view it on my computer.Not very satisfied with that."
4,Pleased,"I enjoyed this movie. I bought it for my grandmother, and we watched it together. This is based on a true story about how Bernedette came to be... by seeing the Virgin Mary. Liked the story, and delivery etc was good."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"This movie is perfect from beginning to end. It's warm and realistic in showing the poverty and the city government in France at the time in which it is set. The characters are outstandingly portrayed and much of the dialogue gives the viewer pause as she observes how the ordinary, difficult lives of the French were affected by something miraculous happening in their midst. Jennifer Jones is outstanding."
5,Really touching,"A fascinating dramatized history of Bernadette, the girl who saw the Lady of Lourdes. I am not a Catholic, but this film mesmerizes every time I see it. Great cast (Vincent Price included, bad guy of course)."
5,Classic Movie,Seller was great. Prompt shipping. DVD was New in package. This is a childhood movie favorite of mine that I've wanted to purchase for a long time. I found it quickly on Amazon and received it within a few days. I'm very pleased with the purchase.
5,profoundly moving,"This film is deeply inspiring, and not even the maudlin, 40s type string arrangements and sentimentality can diminish its power. I am not a great movie lover, but this is it, and can be seen any number of times without losing impact. Only Dreyer`s ""Passion of Joan of Arc"" hovers above this masterpiece inthe pantheon of films."
5,A film that will truly change viewers lives!,"You'll want to watch this wonderful film again and again. Based on documented facts, The Song of Bernadette will touch the lives of anyone who watches. I believe it would convert many non-believers and strengthen the faith of those who are already believers. I happened across it while channel surfing, just as the show began. I couldn't tear my eyes away. I don't think it would be possible for the most hardened person to sit through this film dry eyed. It changed my life and I hope it changes yours. A 5 star rating doesn't do this film justice! I'd like to hear from you after you've seen it."
4,Moving and not too sentimental,"Moving and not too sentimental. . .The death-bed scene of Bernadette is a little bit too much, but on the whole the film is fascinating and finally very moving and should be so for believers and skeptics alike."
5,Wonderful and moving story,"The Song Of Bernadette is a beautiful story about a 19th century miracle. The actors are fabulous, the movie-- well done. Very enjoyable and great for a family movie night."
2,disappointing,"I am a Catholic and believe in the Marian apparitions and the truth behind this movie, but the emphasis seemed very off. Jesus was mentioned maybe twice, and there was more said about suffering for God than loving Him. I certainly wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone, and it will probably leave its viewers thinking that they can never suffer enough for God."
1,movie not good but still !00 percent satisfied,"The movie was not in the best condition but am very satisfied in that the seller Kenneth Juntmen answered my e-mails right away, my money is going to be refunded and I was given the shipping cost back from the seller. I would most certainly buy from this seller again.Barb K."
1,dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed with the DVD Song Of Bernadette as I was unable to view it ,I tried to play it on my DvD and it said it could not be played as it was the wrong code ,I tried on my computer to view it and had the same message ""cant be played wrong code"" so I am very reluctant to purchase anything again through Amazon.com"
1,The Song of Burnadette,"Forget about any gore or decent T&A action either. You've got about as much chance of finding a polar bear in the Sahara than encountering anything controversial in a made for fanatical Christians film. I could also bring up the horrible quality of the print, or the fact that they couldn't even seem to find an actress (Jennifer Jones is uninspiring) who could SCREAM convincingly, but alongside the myriad of other faults, these simply pale into insignificance. For being an everlasting waste of time, and not even getting the complete basics right in being a film about a French peasant girl, I can't give this more than 1/10. Fortunately, unlike poor old Bernadette, you DO have A Place To Hide. It's called another Feature Film, so why not take refuge there rather than bore yourself to tears with crap like this?"
4,Decent History Lesson,"I was trying to get a Catholic DVD collection at home, so I bought this movie. The movie seems fairly well done for it's time. Obviously the technology used doesn't match what we have today. I'm still unsure whether this movie puts a more negative shadow on the priest who tries to question Bernadette's visions than what really happened."
1,Not American,"It wasn't written in the United States. It was foreign and wasn't able to even play it on an DVD Player here in the US. No one informed me that it wasn't something I could watch here in the US. I wasn't told any different. I did get my money back, but not the shipping costs. I won't order a DVD from here anymore, unless it says that it is unplayable in the United States."
5,Great movie,"This is a classic, shown in black and white, a great family movie. It captures a faith so strong, unquestionable, unwavering, demonstrated by Saint Bernadette. Despite being the target of unbelieving town folk, she continued to be faithful and did exactly what was asked of her by our Lady, The Virgin Mary. This resulted in many healings and conversions through the Holy Waters of Lourdes France, that continue still today."
5,Unusually intriguing Photographs,"If you like really great photography presented in interesting ways, you will love this book! It is a great conversation starter and an excellent coffee table book. All ages really like it - our family has from 4 to 75 and we all love reading and enjoying the pictures in this book."
4,only child,"Loved the book, helped me understand my only child who is 18 and leaving for college this year. Could really relate, brought me to tears several times."
2,Would be great if they worked,"We bought this pack to go along with Cook 'n Clean Kitchen by Little Tikes for our daughter's 3rd birthday. I can see now why this item has been discontinued. They do absolutely nothing when placed on the stovetop. Way overpriced for items that can be bought without the ""RFID (sp)technology."" The pasta set works just fine, we just wish this one did as well. The item has been discontinued so I guess we are now stuck with an item that doesn't do what was advertised.We like the kitchen, we just wish the breakfast pack worked.Update: Amazon was good enough to take back the item and refund the entire purchase to include return shipping even though it was past the 30 day return period. We appreciate their consistent courteous assistance. This is one reason we continue to do business with Amazon.com."
3,costume quality,"This dress served its purpose. I used it for a cheap ballroom dance costume (not competition, local performance). It was ok, but definately costume quality. One of the seams (near the bust) wasn't straight so the dress pulled to one side-no one noticed but me. I wore it once and it worked."
5,Fun and Educational,My sons loves music so I bought him this CD. We listen to it every day on the way to daycare and he loves it. The songs are upbeat and fun. There are so many songs on it that as a parent I don't get sick of hearing it. I would recommend it for any parent that wants to expose their child to positive and educational music.
5,An excellent cookbook - and it's vegetarian!,"What great recipes! And the hints and suggestions at the bottom of each recipe really add to the book.And the photography in this book is stunning - I've seen that word used too often, including in the description here on amazon.com, but it really does fit this book.And it IS a vegetarian cookbook. The reviewer who panned it for not being vegetarian needs to make the distinction between vegetarian and vegan. I am a vegetarian, and it's hard to find recipes for such dishes as risotto (like the great ones in this book!) that don't depend on chicken stock. The risotto section in this book starts off with a recipe for the vegetable stock that is used in all the risotto recipes - perfect!"
2,Not a vegetarian cookbook....,"This book is in no way a vegetarian cookbook. Too often vegetarianism is associated with not eating meat, and that is it. A true vegetarian does not eat dairy, eggs, or any meat (poultry, beef, pork, fish and seafood). This cookbook has recipes that include cheese... If you are a true vegetarian this is not the book for you, but if you are just limiting yourself to meatless meals, then this is a good book for you. I rated this book a two, because there are a few recipes that could be modified to fit a vegetarian diet by simply omitting the cheese. They really should change the title to ""Meatless Gusto Italian"""
3,Some great Daffy moments,"If you love Looney Tunes, then like me, you probably have all the Golden Collection volumes, but some of your favorite episodes are missing. So you may want to supplement your collection as I do with the old VHS tapes. If you love Daffy, you may want this tape, although only 3 of the 6 cartoons cannot be found on the Golden Collection DVDs. I suggest ""Just Plain Daffy""- with 8 cartoons and only 2 are repeats from the Golden Collection, as well. But Daffy has been underdone a bit since that first release when they gave us the Scarlet Pimpernel and Duck Amuck amongst others."
4,Daffy Duckyness,"Daffy Duck has remained as Warner Brothers most popular self-egotistical irate of all time. The cartoons he has been featured in, still remain as popular as they were oriiginally released in the 1950's and 1940's.The 1988 video, Daffy Duck's Madcap Mania, reflects the delightful humor, and zaniness this every-duck holds. From detective roles, like The Super Snooper, to his sarcastic demands to be a star in A Star Is Bored, it still proves that no other duck will do in this town. The collection even includes Daffy's only encounters with Henry Hawk in You Were Never Duckier, and Rocky, one half of the duo Rocky and Mugsy, in Golden Yeggs.Although Daffy Duck maybe the complete opposite of any other cartoon fowl, his style and zaniness with every flap of the wing still continues to stand at least one more chuckle in the beak."
3,Dont buy from TimeZone123,"The watch looks good but when I tried to cancel the order immediately after purchase, it was not done. The order was shipped even after I have canceled the order with the vendor. That's why I am giving 3, else the product is good."
4,Attractive and utilitarian,"I bought this and several other components of the Rosle Open Kitchen system several years ago, but installed it just 6 months ago. Though pricey, it looks good, does a better than average job dispensing towels, and appears to be well made and durable. It is rather large, however, measuring 13.5"" L x 8"" H x 7"" D. But I gave it only 4 stars due to the price. At about $100, this is by far the most expensive towel dispenser I've ever bought."
5,Another winner from ASV,"Like many ""serious"" jazz singers, bop vocalist Anita O'Day apprenticed as a big band singer back in the swing era... This generously programmed collection gathers 25 tunes from her early years working with Gene Krupa, Stan Kenton, Will Bradley and others... At first she sounds undistinctive, just another songbird who couldn't hit the golden tones of Helen Forrest or Ella Fitzgerald. Then, as time passes and her records get more daring, O'Day's unique voice emerges, including the harder tones and hornlike bursts that set her apart from the pop vocals crowd. This is a great set for anyone interested in her early years."
3,They screwed up this album!!!,"As a Motorhead fan, I have to say I was really disappointed with how they've adapted the LP for this CD. The original LP was from a single live show, so the entire LP flowed like a live show -- a song, applause in the middle, then another song. You almost felt like you were there.To adapt this for the CD, they've created breaks in between the songs to correspond to the different CD tracks, and it sounds totally artificial. It really destroys what had been an amazing live peformance.If you can't find the LP (or don't have an LP player) I guess you should settle for this version (the music still rocks!). But if you're a Motorhead purist like me, prepare to be a little disappointed."
5,Andrea Dworkin is insane...and I love it!,"I first started reading ""Life and Death"" over a year ago, but I put it down after a while because I found her ideas to be incredibly stupid. However, recently I picked it up again after reading John Water's book, ""Shock Value"". He inspired me to enjoy reading the rants of the insane just for fun. Andrea Dworkin's work cannot be approached as writing that will stimulate your intellect since she lies a LOT, but if you're a person who enjoys reading for camp value or who likes reading the ramblings of a woman out of her mind, then this is the writer for you. Not only that, but her style is very effective as well."
4,"Powerful, brutal, the truth.","I read this book recently and was quite compelled by it. Andrea Dworkin's analysis of the war on women is both powerful and shockingly brutal. While i do not agree with all her views on different subject matter, i do echo her thoughts on acts of rape and the people who commit those acts. this book voices her opinions on the different ways that women are raped every day. I understand the horror that people go through and i truly agree with andrea when she says that women should do whatever possible to fight back. Truly empowering and thought provoking."
5,"By the far, the best.","I own lots of nailers, and a PC pin nailer. The PC is good but only allows 1 inch pins. I love the pins, as they are almost invisible when driven. I needed longer pins, so I bought this item..... GREAT. Very high quality."
4,Great Little Printing Machine,"I bought the Sony Digital Photo Printer (DPP-SV77) about a year ago with the intention of using it for all myphoto printing. It is easy to use, compact, and fits anywhere. It produces a great looking photo. The photos that measure 4 by 6 inches are perfect for printing postcards or borderless prints.Negatives: It prints too slow, and it's hard to find the glossy sheets of printing paper/print cartridge packetsthat are much too expensive. I'm wondering if they are becoming obsolete??This makes nice quick photos, but for enlargements and other custom work, this will not be the one to use.I give this product 4 stars, deducting one star because of the negatives."
5,"Captivating, funny, and hopeful!",Joki is a book you want to start reading on a Friday evening because you will want to finish reading it before work interrupts! It's a great story with lots of humor and information. The book leaves you with a sense of hope and a smile on your face.
3,A Mascot Pictures Primer,"Veteran author Jon Tuska presents a well written overview of pioneer serial studio Mascot Pictures and its founder Nat Levin by retracing the studio's early serials through to its last effort(s). Especially notable are the authors less than glowing commentary on Gene Autry, the man & myth, contrasted by a kind rendering of cowboy legend Tom Mix's Mascot story. Informative and decent historical presentation given by an author whose personal interviews with many of the persons who lived this story adds to the telling."
3,"Awkward, but sweet.","Not terrible, just too many problems for me to really fully enjoy. The basketball coach is a complete dork, and the housewife is overweight and frumpish, so no way can you ever feel like there is anything hot going on. The love scenes were awkward, un-sexy. And the naked basketball playing? Uhhh, no. What worked was the reality that this kind of thing happens (the falling in love between women thing), the feelings between the women, and their developing love is sweet. The ending was very unrealistic though. If you absolutely have nothing else to do one day, it's not an entire waste of time."
2,yawn...and nude basketball? puh-leez!,"A banal foray into that gym teacher thing...my gym teach sure didn't look as tired and depressed as this gal. The love scenes are awkward and although the spinning of the camera during the nude basketball/love scene was evidently trying to be artsy it induced a whirling-dervish sort of seasickness. If you want a hot b-ball scene watch the last ten minutes of ""bar girls"" also a banal stupid movie but much more worth the wait.Why can't there be better erotic lesbian films out there!"
4,how did i ever miss this movie!!!!!!!,"to all the people responsible for making this movie, all i can say is thank you from the bottom of my heart! i laughed and cried, and felt for the main characters because of what they went through! being a late bloomer is a mixed blessing sometimes, but always will it feel so definitive in your life's journey, that it is very valuable to you, no matter what others think about you and/or your choices in life. i so identified with the main characters in the film so my humble opinion may be biased to some. but no matter, i loved this film! Lee"
2,Another Housewife to Lesbian (this is geting quite boring),"I found this to be slow, dry, and predictable.If you are into slow moving movies this one is for you. Woman meets married housewife, Woman gets married housewife, guy losses wife. The understanding husband and children become the loving supporters. However there is a saving grace, the humor and not some young thing in college or high school."
2,Late Bloomers is a bust!,"When I read the storyline this film sounded like it would be fun to watch. The actors did a pretty good job, but in my opinion, they didn't have much to work with. The writer could have developed the characters and their relationship much better. Waiting for a little more depth in the dialog between characters left me disappointed. The filmLate Bloomers [VHS] was only lightly intertaining because of the weak storyline. I found myself being distracted and feeling like I could be doing something more interesting with my time, you know, like folding the laundry, giving the dog a bath or scrubbing the toilet."
3,Unusual Movie,"This movie should have been called California Free Spirited Women.. Quirky and funny in part and if you make it to the end, okay."
2,The art of the Fellowship of the ring has limited offerings,"The art of the fellowship of the ring focuses primarily on background / environmental rough concepts and creature designs, with only brief sections covering costume and armory. Many of the most wonderful and unique artistic contributions to the film are bypassed completely; including any detailed drawings or photos of Jewelry, props, and furnishings (looking for an image of that nouveau chair at Rivendell, or the elven rings? You're out of luck)! The small format doesn't do the images any favors either; New Line and Mr. Russell would do well to look into the designs of the Disney ""Art of"" books for future volumes.Bottom line; great book for a teenage boy whose tastes run towards ""Dungeons and dragons"" and comic books. But for older Tolkien fans and serious artists, this book falls far short of the mark."
