2,Weak and not even worth a look,"Ironic this was about a shipwreck, because that's exactly how I would describe it as a movie. The title was rather misleading, especially since 'they' came during the day as well. The movie spent way too much time on weak romantic character development and not enough time on suspense or scares - unless you are frightened by rustling leaves and shaking branches. Without the usual formula of naked women, gore, or scares to hold your attention, not sure what the intended purpose of this B-movie was. The whole thing seemed rushed, and frankly, I was in a hurry for it to be over as well. The premise and appearance of the creatures ripped off Predator. And only because I actually loved Predator, I gave it two stars instead of just one."
1,What a turd,"Sorry, sux. It's not funny (although the creature-makeup looks like leftovers from ORCS), it's not scary (how can anybody compare it to DESCENT [like the German bluray-backcover does?) but it's boring... 5 not very likable 20-somethings are stranded on an remote island, there are noises in the trees... and halt-eaten carcasses. ok, reads like a dozen other shaky-cam snooze-fests from the last months. what sets it apart? nothing. dont buy, dont rent...dont even look at the cover while browsing at blockbuster's."
4,Well-written and very good!,"This is a very good text to use, especially for anyone with very little background in the Byzantine empire. However, be warned, the author is a specialist in the Byzantine military, so he does go on in painstaking detail about the military, and not enough about the social and intellectual development of Constantinople. But as I have said, it is well-written and very informative."
2,Tetchy and biased towards Christianity,"This is a survey of the entire Byzantine history. To this end, the author does a somewhat good job. He really does spend a lot of time explaining how irrelevant and/or incorrect his survey predecessors are. Ostrogovsky gets a good pummeling throughout the book. But the fact of the matter is, Treadgold never does much of a convincing job in explaining how any of his positions are even different from Ostrogovsky's, let alone more correct.At the same time, Treadgold every so often indulges in Christian Apologia -- explaining why this or that heinous action by Christians was inevitable or done to save the religion, etc. I don't mind that kind of thing too much, but it does feel very jarring in the middle of a history survey text."
3,An Old-Fashioned Political History,"Readers should be aware that many professional Byzantine historians do not recommend this work, although it is certainly much more reliable than the work of Lord Norwich.The problem with the book is that it does indeed seek to replicate the achievement of Ostrogorsky's _History of the Byzantine State_, which, for its time, summed up the scholarly consensus on the political history or Byzantium.Since the last revision of Ostrogorsky, over 30 years ago, the subjects of interest to historians have changed radically. In addition to political and military history, we are now just as interested in cultural, intellectual, and social history. Despite the ""And Society"" in the title, Treadgold's book does not adequately take into account the development of new types of history.A new survey text to replace Ostrogorsky is desperately needed, but this text will not be the replacement."
5,The Best Classic Game/Book Ever,"This Game is DA BOMB!!!! If you want a classic video game/ book, this is it."
4,It was very factual and this book is an exra advantage.,"There was an error for glacier. It sholud be hold a and anolog stick for his cryonic kick. Other than this and other small errors, it is one of the best guides I own."
3,The almost perfect book,"I thought this book was okay, but there was a lot of mistakes. For examble, the coner moves. Most of those where wrong! Whats up with that!"
3,economical trimmer,This trimmer is relatively inexpensive and doesnt rely on any sort of proprietary soddered in rechargeable battery which is nice because those tend to fail and arent replaceable.. this trimmer takes a couple AA batteries which is nice though for the price replacement wouldn't be much of an issue. I use the thing to trim my whiskers when i go without shaving for a couple weeks so I use it without any attachments. The whiskers do catch and it can be unpleasant when you are not being careful. But I think for the time being it beats spending over 100$ on some expensive electric shaver whose 'rechargeable' battery will die and wont be able to be replaced. This thing is small and if you lose it it is no big deal.
4,"Small, convenient trimmer","This seems like it will work for me. Although having a somewhat flimsy feel, this trimmer is battery operated - it runs on two AA batteries (the batteries are not included, btw) THAT YOU CAN CHANGE. I had a Norelco trimmer before, and although it had more features and seemed like it had more durable qualities than this Panasonic, the batteries failed after two years and could not be changed."
5,Excellent Expresso!,I can't say much more than what the title to this review states! Consistent quality and excellent service by PodMerchants!
2,not really what I ordered....,"too expensive, found for less on other sites. Took too long to receive. Also, product didn't come as pictured, instead came in very large bottle and product doesn't look like the mask I have used prior of the same name."
2,The lid didn't fit well...,"I was expecting there to be more rubber around the inner part of the lid, to make it ""airtight.""However I found it not to be that way and am afraid if it were to fall out of the spice cabinet it would spill.So I still haven't figured out what to do with it, it's a bit too tall for toothpicks but it may work."
3,"Seller fine, product had issues","First, the seller, OK Sales did a fine job. They packaged and shipped as you would wish. The pump, however has issues. This came with a nice filter box and generous filter pads. This is ideal for my pond, under the live oak tree. The pump, while listed as 210 gallons, was very small in size and was not a very strong push. It went at one speed then drastically dropped pressure to a dribble. I contacted the Beckett company. They were VERY nice and agreed to ship another pump for a $5 fee. OK, I'll go along with that. I haven't received the new one yet as I just completed the transaction with Beckett. If I had it to do over, I'd go with another Pondmaster brand."
5,pond filter,Great!! everything works.. more then what I was expecting... great to deal with and will purchase from them again in the futurethank you.
2,not even close to 210 gph,"If you really want 210 gph pump look elsewhere. I would guess it is pumping about half that capacity and even less after about a week without cleaning the entire system. It needs cleaning about once a week because it starts to clog and air builds up inside the box and makes it float. Should have gotten another tetra pond filter like I had for 5 years but wanted to try and save a few bucks. Bad choice on my part, will probably be replacing this summer."
1,cord is NOT twenty feet long,"The product description indicates that this has a 20 foot cord. The set I got has a 15 foot cord, which means it wouldn't work in my pond after I spent an hour setting it all up. Now what am I supposed to do - return a sopping wet pump box? I am not happy."
3,"for the Ethnomusicologist, not the casual ""World Music fan""","Most of the songs were recorded in mountain villages in 1964. I was hoping for more music from dedicated musicians. There are a couple of songs copied from 45s bought in an Indian market in Lima, but even these are very rough and raw. Perhaps there's material here for a Moby of Peruvian music, but its not for the average consumer's ears. One ""Song of Marraige,"" sung by a young girl, was included on the Voyager spacecraft as one the of the ""Sounds of Earth."" The lyric in the linear note translates it as a bitter, but humorous, complaint of a girl who is tricked into attending her own wedding."
5,Surprisingly Magnificent,"I was immediately hooked when I heard the track ""When Sorrow Calls"" . . .I was a little skeptical when I saw his picture . . but you know they say that you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. . .this man has soul! and his voice . . .beautiful . . .this is a must buy."
2,"Buy the stock, not the alarm service.","If you are thinking about signing up for Monitronics alarm service, READ THE FINE PRINT! They require a minimum term of 3 years, then jack the price up by 5% per year without notice. This is a competitive industry so shop around for a shorter term and a FIXED monthly charge!"
3,Spookhouse Fun,"This is a clever idea by Matchbox, linking the love of cars and a spooky atmosphere. The house and the van that comes with this playset reminds me of Scooby-Doo. We bought this for our daughter who is a huge Scooby fan. Yes, it does have some frustrating elements to it, like the upside down car and getting stuck, but kids still enjoy it. My kids use it as an action figure backdrop for more creative play. It's cute and not too big to store."
1,very disapointed,"My son loves cars, but unfortunatly, is very disapointed with this toy. The car is supposed to travel through the house, setting off spooky sounds. However, when the car goes into the ""tower"" it flips upside down, becoming jammed. The car cannot continue through the house unless you reach in and flip it over, or, shake the house violently (which is what the frustrated 4 year old does). I will not purchase any more of this matchbox series, as my son has decided it is ""not a fun toy, becuase my car gets stuck."""
1,Very disappointed :(,"I was very disappointed in the quality and function of this toy. The truck gets stuck in the second tower. The movable parts are hard for a small child to maneuver. Lastly, the slightest ""roughness"" by the child causes it to fall apart. I'm normally a big fan of matchbox, but not in this case."
5,So much fun!,"I bought this as a Halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004. He loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house. He doesn't really use it much anymore, but now my 18 month old loves it! He can actually follow the whole progression, turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time. This toy has been great for our family. It is pretty durable, some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore, but considering what it has gone through, it has performed amazingly well."
5,Great for the 2-4 year old boy,It was such a great gift for my little boy. He played with it every day. It has so much going on and is very durable. We enjoyed this toy for two years.
2,My five year old wanted this toy for quite awhile....,"but when he received it as gift from his grandparents, he played with it for a couple of hours and then asked me to take it back to the store because ""it's boring."" We've agreed to just put it in the closet a bit in case he decides to play with it later. While the toy is solidly built, there isn't much substance to it."
4,Great Series of Toy,We have now purchased three of the Matchbox play sets and I have to say that I am impressed with the functionality and fun that we have experienced with the toy. My three year old son does like to play with these and they are also somewhat of a decorative item as we create a city like them with them when playing other games and with his train sets. I recommend this series as I was able to purchase each for around $15.
5,Spooky Fun for the Little Ones,"This toy was a big hit with my 4 year old. He loves playing with his ""spooky house"" and I have to say no other toy has ever held his attention for so long. He too is a Scooby Doo fan so he spends hours pretending he and the ""gang"" are out solving mysteries. The toy seems very durable and holds together well considering how much he plays with it. Definately a keeper!"
3,Hotwheels,Son had a lot of fun. Car kept getting stuck inside but he figured out hou to get it out. Kid out grew this toy a while ago.
5,A HAUNTING MATCHBOX PLAYSET,"I have a 2 1/2 year old who is just a nut about anything scary. He loves Halloween, ghosts, pumpkins, skeletons, bats...it's amazing. He's not the least bit scared. When my wife and I saw this matchbox set discounted at a toys-r-us before Christmas we knew he'd love it.This is part of Matchbox's Hero City line and features a neat haunted house set-up as a car is elevated to the top, travels across a bridge held by a skeletal hand, then rotates inside the house and down a platform, then pivots and travels along it's way with a helpful shove from a ghost, all with spooky sounds playing. My son just loves it. It's eay to assemble and the only problem I found is that when it has to rotate in the upper room of the house, the mechanism sometimes becomes jammed but it's easily corrected.A fun toy!"
5,Destined To Become A Classic,"I'm a ""Grown-Up"" Toy and Game Enthusiast, and I can tell You with much confidence that this Playset is Destined to Become a Classic. It's simple, yet complex enough to keep anybody's attention... both Young and Old. It's made of the durable kind of plastic, not the cheap stuff that tends to crack or break if You sneeze too hard. The sound effects are right on target... not too loud, not too soft, and definitely not distorted. Some assembly is required, but it's very minimal and not a big deal... the only Hard part is unattaching it from the inside of the box... so take Your time with that part, as to not accidentally damage anything. Bottom line, this Playset is definitely worth Your hard earned Pasos. :)"
5,My 4 year old loves this toy!,"We purchased this toy for my 4 year old son for his birthday and it is his favorite toy. He loves playing with cars so this toy was perfect for him. He will play with this and the play mat that goes with it by himself for an hour. Unlike other car playsets this one has not fallen apart with tough use. It makes scary noises and you can even turn off the sound if you need to! Some times the cars do get stuck in the toy, but if you use the car that came with the haunted house it usually doesn't get stuck. You can use other cars, you just have to try them out if they will get stuck or not. It also came with a great playmat."
4,Great Toy!,My 7 year old son really enjoys this toy. Durable and fun and easy to assemble but sometimes the cars get stuck and are unable exit the haunted house without some help! Overall a good toy.
3,run of the mill,"This book is okay. I didn't find myself learning anything new, but it's kind of a memory refresher. It did feel as if the author felt as though their way was the only way, which was off putting."
2,Outmoded training ideas,"Although I eagerly hoped for a good book about introducing agility to puppies with positive reinforcement, this book gravely disappointed me. In fact, this book was so filled with punishments (""corrections"") of the puppy that I could barely believe that the book had been recently written; it read like dog training books written 20 years ago. It appeared to me that the author had been left behind in the revolution in positive reinforcement dog training. The author's ideas are particularly disturbing because they are applied to puppies."
5,A forgoten masterpiece,"This novel has often been compared to William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies,"" but I find ""Our Mother's House to be far better. This story of young children left to fend for themselves after their mother's death doesn't need a desert island for a setting: it is fascinating in its own right. Buy it!"
5,In a nut shell,"The toughts of the supposed beginings of the universe are thought provoking. The book was easy to read, in fact this book took me no time at all, but has left me with a life time of knowledge."
4,Short and Quick,"With its wide margins, large typeface, and slim 167-page profile, this collection of seven lectures almost qualifies as a pamphlet. You'll speed through it in no time, but it is pleasantly written. If you have an interest in popular science, you've likely seen much of the information before; the book is really just highlights of Hawking's previously published works. But it is a nice survey of current theories about cosmology, black holes, and the nature of time. Heavy subjects, treated lightly."
5,Great material,I have long been a fan of Steven Hawking and I am constantly fascinated with his ease at making the most complex theory sound so simple. No Steven Hawking fan should overlook this book.
3,"Ok however,",I found this book to be ok - a bit out of date however usually understandable. I prefered a book from M. R. Franks titled The Universe and Multiple Reality.
1,I Hate Stephen Hawking,"Why? Because this book, as well as Universe in a Nutshell, and A Briefer History of Time, are nothing more than slightly modified versions of A Brief History of Time. Hawking provides nothing additional to what he's already published so don't waste your time & money."
1,Professor Hawking did NOT authorize this Book,"On his website, Professor Stephen Hawking claims he did NOT authorize the publication of this book under his name."
1,"Read the ""author""'s opinion on this book !","Pr. Hawking gives this opinion on this book ! The policy here is not to give URLs, so just search for Pr. Hawking homepage on the web and you will know... I quote : ""We would urge you not to purchase this book in the belief that Professor Hawking was involved in its creation.""I suggest that you instead buy ""A Brief History of Time"" which is a terribly great book !My comment on New Millenium Pr (publisher) is that it looks like they have little scruples... Who would try to make money on a disabled person ?"
1,There is not comparison,This book PALES in comparison withA Brief History of TimeandA Briefer History of Time.I highly recommend either of those two books over this one.
2,Too basic,I'm not a scientist. I admire Dr Hawking. But in this book he needed to write it like he was addressing someone with a little more basic knowledge in science.
4,The End of the Dance,"Schorske employs the vision of a garden (Eden) to dramatize how deeply the changes of modernization were felt in Vienna. Just as Adam and Eve were forced out of the perfect garden, so where Viennese forced to redefine their perspectives of what High Culture was and what importance was. By analyzing creators of elite culutre and the revolution they inspired, Schorske tells a story of Vienna and its thrust into the modern world"
3,Like 'em but...,"they are comfortable and work for the gym shower, I just don't understand why the flop straps are so long and I am surprised that no other reviews mention how long the straps are."
4,Basic Flip Flop with Great Color Choises @ Amazon,I love this basic rubber flip flop style but these are way over-priced. My shopping on Amazon saved me lots of time and gas money in finding the solid colors I wanted. I have bought them in the past at a fraction of the price but this time I didn't ride from store to make my selection.
5,My favourite flip-flops!,"These really are the best brand of flip-flops on the market. I recently had a pair that I bought back in 2007 finally give out on me. I wore these flip-flops all the time and everywhere. They were my main foot wear for several summers in Europe and never had any problems with them. I was so disappointed when I had to trash them, but I immediately ordered another pair. I'm sure they'll last me for another 5 years!"
2,"Squishy sole, but painful between toes","I enjoy the sky blue color and the soles are squishy, more comfortable than many flip flops...HOWEVER, the rubber toe hold has caused painful blistering due to rubbing when I walk. I think I will stick with my Teva flip flops and wear these sandals for showering when I camp."
4,Excellent Flip Flops But Pricey,"I really like these flip flops, but whether they are worth the money is questionable. They are very soft and comfortable, but don't seem that much different from other flip flops you can get a the drugstore."
2,ouch,I was so looking forward to these flip flops. Can't seem to find the old school kind that don't hurt. These were expensive for what they are and they hurt. Pieces stick out weird on the thong and hurt. Sorry I ordered them...
5,The perfect flip flop,"I'm so happy with these flip flops! They feel very sturdy, yet still lightweight and VERY comfortable. I ordered white and they're very cute so I'm getting them in two other colors. Sure, you can get cheaper brands of flip flops, but these really feel like they're well-made and will last a long time. Definite 5-star purchase!"
1,Incorrect sizing,"I ordered the (37-38 /US 7-8) shoes and received a pair of shoes clearly marked ""US 6."" I need to return these because they are way too small."
3,Good Flip Flop but somewhat uncomfortable,"I have a difficult time finding comfortable Flip Flops for summer so I tried these. I found them to be uncomfortable because of the ridges in the insole (they agrevate the bottom of my feet). Most Flip Flops today have a smooth inner sole, but these specific sandles have some pretty rough ridges (I suppose to keep you from slipping). I have another pair of this same brand in a flowered insole pattern and they are a bit smoother and more comfortable. My other complaint is with the sizes. I would prefer if they did not combine sizes (example 8 to 9). It would be better if they offered some whole sizes."
5,Good!,I like it very much!!!!!It feels pretty comfortable when I wear it. I think I will buy more flip flops from here.
3,Sized incorrectly,"The shoes themselves were stamped 39 cm. however, they were actually either 40 or 41 cm. At least they weren't too small. I decided not to exchange because they took so long to arrive in the first place...I'd still be waiting I think..."
5,Worth the money,"After buying a cheapo flip flop in the past, I can say that it's definitely worth forking out the big bucks for a good quality Havaianas. My cheapos, lasted a week, the foam started to shrink and the color discoloured onto my feet. My Havaianas on the other hand have maintained their thickness. They don't stain my feet (I've got black ones) and I've worn them to everywhere (even riding my bike). Best part is, they are so comfy."
3,Good quality rubber but not true to size,sizes seems off.. I asked for M60 & the flip flop said M50 but it was still little bit lose... the quality is much better... & soft...
4,Great!,"I love havaiana flip flops and prefer to wear only these! They are comfortable, very durable, and last a really long time. The only issue I had with mine was the fact that since they were shipped, the top straps that sit over my foot warped a little bit and it took them a long long time to straighten out and sit right."
3,Sizing Not Consistent! Try them on in a store!,"Overall a very comfortable sandal, right up there with reefs as long as you like rubber straps. The soles are quite cushy. However, beware...I ordered two pairs of these flip flops, one in black and one in brown, same style and size. Just received them today and couldn't wait to try them on. Turns out that while they are stamped with the same size 37/38, the black ones are a good half inch shorter than the brown ones. I wear a US7.5-8, and the ""larger"" brown ones fit fine, but the black ones are almost too small, I foresee stubbing my toes. My suggestion is to buy them in the store if you can, but if you want to get a good deal and buy them online, buy the next size up!If the sizing was consistent, I would definitely give these 5 stars."
5,The best flip flops ever,This is like my 5th pair of these flip flops and I just love them. Because they are quality made you never have to worry about them turning your feet the color of the flip flop like the cheaper ones do. Very comfortable too!
5,Havaianas,"I love havaianas! I have two pairs, one brown and one blue, I couldn't wait to get some black one's! They're so comfortable and very simple and cute."
4,Viva Brasil,"These are fantastic flip flops. Durable and comfortable, I have at least a dozen pairs. The ones with the skinnier straps seem less comfortable, but sometimes the wider ones (like shown here) can be turned and can dig into the top of the foot. If not for that they are perfect. For the price, you can't beat them."
1,Havaianas Flip Flops,"I ordered these because I thought they would be more comfortable than most flip flops. They weren't! I wanted the green which is really pretty, but the plastic thong part is really uncomfortable. I gave mine to a consignment shop."
1,Comfortable? NOT,"I searched everywhere on line for flip flops because I had hurt the top of my foot and thought I had pay dirt when I found these and read all of the positive reviews. They are uncomfortable, they have unfinished rubber pieces all over the edges making them rough. The thong piece and the two side pcs that goes through to the bottom do not lay flat and that is also uncomfortable. Add a rough foot bed and it adds up to a big waste of money for a thong that looks like a piece of rubber from an old tire. The final kicker was that night when I went to payless I found a beautiful collection of flip flops in different colors and styles at $3.99 each, buy 1 get the second 1/2 price ($2)."
3,Lasts a good amount of time,"I ordered these almost two years ago, and they've finally broken. The top part of the slipper that goes between the big toe and the second toe broke apart from the sole of the slipper. I have been using these as shower slippers and bedroom slippers since I stay in a college dormitory. They were fairly comfortable once they were worn in."
4,not exactly what I expected...,"I bought these Havaianas on amazon because I heard that this brand was great for flip flops, so I wanted to try it out. I get anxious when ordering items that have sizes online since I don't want to accidentally order the wrong size. So I went to various sites including the original Havaianas store online and checked that I was ordering the right size. However, when I got my package in the mail and I put the flip flops on, the back of my heel protruded at least a good inch or so. I was quite sad when this occurred after all my hard work of trying to find the right size. Thankfully, my roommate was interested in buying them so I didn't have to return the shoes.I think I might order a pair my size in the future though. I still want to test how comfortable these shoes are!"
1,Worst Service,"I ordered these flip flops, but they sent me the wrong size THREE times. Amazon barely helped with the returns. They allow returns, but the whole process was a mess.So, to summarize. I had to return the three pairs of flip flops, and I never received flip flops in my size."
5,Theyare great!,These flip flops look great & feel great. Who could ask for more? I even ordered more in different colors.
2,Not True to Size,"I LOVE Havianas Tops but, this pair - in the same size that I have ordered before - was too small. Very disappointed. Reordered from Zappos, hope they get it right."
1,lousy product,We brought the first one home and it didn't pump..Got a second one and it pumped for three weeks and stopped..This is a junk item. They should test these items before they leave the factory
2,disappointing,My daughter rceived this toy as a gift over a week ago and we have yet to see it work after returning it 3 times to get a working one we still have not in my opinion buying this toy is a gamble
2,Photo book,"The editor of this slim paperback volume calls it ""simply a photo ID book,"" and indeed, that's what it is. The only text is the name below each photo. The photos are black-and-white, and the layout is simple and a bit rough. The photos are also not in any particular order. Most are individual shots, but some are stills, and it would've been nice to know the movie each still is from. And the book is not without error (Ann-Margret's name is misspelled, for instance)."
4,Sadly unknown `The Unknown Soldier',"Without doubt this is a major work of 20th century European literature. This translation is not all that one would hope but in the absence of a better, we should be grateful for this much. It ain't bad (`cept in some places it is, rather) and Linna's genius carries the day. So it's 5 stars, minus one for that weakness. My advice; read this with great enjoyment, then hope that Impola does a new translation.....or learn Finnish."
5,Very Handy,I love my small saw and have found it so handy for working on my sprinkler that I wonder what to do without it. I works great for cutting PVC and plastic.
3,Newer design replaces this one,"These HQ 156 heads are no longer made.The newer Norelco HQ 167 Cool Skin/Advantage heads replace these older HQ 156 Advantage 5615X, Advantage 5655X-only heads."
4,Don't hold your breath for the murder (Possible spoilers),"You will be waiting quite some time if you expect this to be a traditional cosy, i.e. one or two murders in the first half and then red herrings and suspects peppered through the rest of the novel. Some reviewers called this dull, perhaps because it is not the classic cosy-by-numbers. It is more of a meditation on motivations and an individual's misconceptions explored through the events and misadventures related on the page. Will Miss Pym be quite so self-assured and ready to judge after the twist rigt at the very end?"
3,not a murder mystery,"This book is a well-written character study of an unusual enclosed community, but it's not really a murder mystery. Frankly, not enough crime, and the motivation of one of the main characters was never explained to my satisfaction.This book suffers because its cover declares it to be something it is not; it's a pity the author (or her estate) didn't demand a more truthful blurb."
3,Great author... but the least of her works,"Unless you're really into whatever nostalia a girls' school might render for you personally, you should probably pass on this one and pick up ""The Man in the Queue,"" ""The Singing Sands,"" ""A Shilling for Candles,"" ""The Daughter of Time, "" or even ""Brat Farrar"". This one is a really slow starter and Miss Pym is just not my idea of a ""detective"" (of sorts).I'm a huge fan of Josephine Tey, but unless you're reading all her works as a project, just pass this one by and you'll not be disappointed."
4,"Interesting, well worth reading","I first read ""Brat Farrar"" when I was about 14 years of age. Over the 20 years since then I have read all of Josephine Tey's other books, most recently, ""Miss Pym Disposes"".If you have not read her other works, my advice is not to start with this one. Having said that, it is well worth reading. Her ability to create exactly the right atmosphere is amazing, definitely one of those ""I cant put this down until I finish it"" experiences.However, to my mind, the ending is just ""wrong"" - I cant say more than that without giving it away - hence the four stars instead of five."
3,Subtle yet lethal,"An exquisitely crafted ""cozy mystery"" that lulls you into a sleepy little world in mid-century England -- and then wallops you with the best surprise ending since ""Presumed Innocent."""
4,A memorable meeting,"How I would have loved knowing Mrs. Whaley beyond the pages of her books. She has the most deliciously charming perspective on a world gone by and presents her recollections with a spirit right at home in today. She's observes with pithy candor and humor and reading her nuggets of advice is a real treat. Besides, the recipes look marvellous--and very Southern."
5,mercedes 300sl coupe,Excellent pictorial and historical accounts of the development of the production Mercedes Benz 300sl coupe (and roadster)from its racing predecessors. Great photographs of the various vehicles in actual race situations in the 1950's. Candid snapshots and descriptive highlights of the famous drivers who raced these cars.
3,I few too many Puns,"We were required to read this book for an English 101 class. I find that a straight forward and to the point approach is more useful to me than one that is presented with humor. I'm not quite sure why I would, but if I were to read this book for fun I would probably enjoy this book for its humor and accesibility, but in the classroom, I think I would much rather use a book with alot less puns and more information. All in all, a funny approach to grammer and the English language."
3,Que the Unwitty Anecdote,"As far as content is concerned, Words Fail Me does its job. It presents some of the most boring material a person could endeavor to write about in a manner that is mildly amusing. Emphasis on the mild. Unfortunately it falls short on just about every other attempt. The humor was childish and not amusing in the least and her examples were redundant as well as overdone. Often times I found myself glazing over pages that were just examples of a certain point that most people learned in fourth grade grammar. I'll probably keep the book as a grammar reference because it's at least well organized, but I wouldn't recommend reading this if you don't have to."
3,"Not bad, Not good either.","After reading the book entitled Words Fail Me, by Patricia O'Conner, I would rather not rate it at all. It is hard to rate a book you do not choose to read on your own. So I give it three stars. For not being bad nor good. Parts of me are glad this was an assignment because it has some useful information. The information is given in a form that is easy to understand. On the other hand it was a little long winded and boring. O'Conners' jokes were a little much."
2,NO MORE JOKES!!,Words Fail Me brings a lighthearted approach to the misery of grammar and punctuation. Patricia T. O'Conner does a good job of making insistent humorous jokes during the course of this book but leaves the reader without a sense of actually learning anything of value. After reading this book I found myself not wanting to ever hear another English joke again!
5,A funny book about writing well.,"My mom gave me Pat O'Conner's last book, Woe Is I, and I have used it a lot in my high school English classes. This year I am a junior and will be taking English composition. I know Words Fail Me will be a big help. Maybe I'll get another A! Also, the book is lots of fun to read."
5,Once again....,"Once again, Patricia O'Conner writes a great reference book. With similar style, (humor included), it creates a world for the reader, that many authors cannot do. Great job!"
5,Astounding.......,"Words like ""marvelous,"" ""remarkable,"" ""wonderful,"" ""astounding,"" ""incredible,"" don't even begin to describe this great book. It really touched home. A must read for every mother or son."
5,#1,"I have at least 15 different Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee CD's, maybe more. This one is my favorite hands down. Brownie McGhee sounds so good doing the backup vocals on a lot of tracks, and Sonny has never sounded better singing in my opinion. Most of the songs Sonny sings on other albums, I don't care for that much. I actually prefer to hear Brownie and not Sonny. But this one is just outstanding. All these songs feel so good to listen to. I think this is the CD that the two of them were at there absolute BEST. Overall I rank this one in my Top 10 Blues CD's that I own. And I own well over 100 of different artists A-Z."
1,Buyer Beware,"I received the SecureAir in December 2010. Now in February 2011 the UV bulb has failed. Contacted the manufacturer in Ohio and THE BULB IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. After two months use, customer service told me I can purchase the bulb from them for $29 and shipping would be $10. I asked if I could just use without bulb working and was told it wouldn't do much. Terrible Warranty, Customer Service and Product. I believe that this product is a throwaway."
5,Songs of wonderful sound,"The title of this Titi Robin's Cd is the perfect match with the quality and beauty of the melodies and songs that integrate this compilation. The sound of the Gipsy Robin's guitar, joined with the Arabian percussion and exotic voices, create a very nice acoustic atmosphere to listen, rest and lift the mind and senses to higher level of consciousness."
5,Texutal Criticism,"Great chart in this book for analyzing the textual aparatus in the UBS. Other than that, Greenlee is clear and concise. Recommended."
4,Cleared out the fog,"In doing Greek Readings, I was pretty fogged-up about what textual criticism meant, how it worked, or whether or not it was even a good idea.After getting through Greenlee's text, bought back before I trusted internet commerce and so not from Amazon, I think I understand the issues better now. I certainly grasp the importance of the discipline and how it can be applied.This is an academic book, though, so come ready. A good pot of coffee would be my recommendation."
5,High quality material,"This is one of three books and presents the best material on the market, imho. I don't know what else to say that wouldn't be a rehash of the book description."
4,Very good introduction,"I used this book as an introduction to Greek New Testament textual criticism. I found the chart very helpful and with it I was able to practice what the book instructed. I understand that Greenlee's work has been critiqued since he does not necessarily deal with the more difficult text-critical passages/issues. However, I think this is so because his purpose is not a critical introduction to textual criticism but a basic how-to manual with some background information. With this understood I think that this book is a good spring-board into the discussion along with Metzger's companion to the UBS and the usual Aland, Metzger and Black. In sum, for a tradition that is so rich and deep this book fulfills the introductory goals set forth by the writer."
5,How did I miss this?,"I never knew about this show until I watched a clip of Sam Elliot on Conan. I thought he was hilarious, as well as the clip from season two of his show Eagleheart. Afterward I was curious to see how much season one was. Thankfully it was super cheap so I took a gamble and bought it. THANKFULLY! I did. One of the best shows I have seen in awhile. Also my new favorite show on Adult Swim, which is saying a lot in my opinion. If you enjoy Aqua teen of old or anything with dark humor I guarantee you will love this show. I know I did. 5/5 would bang repeatedly."
1,Dumb Not Funny,Not funny. I could not see the charactures it was like 1/2 hour of the same scene over and over. what a waste of time.
1,could not get into this show.,"I tried, tried, tried, tried to get into this program, but I just oucld not. I could not make it past the first epi."
1,LSD induced writing experience,"The writer was obviously on an LSD induced writing experience. The devil dit it lets blame the devil. This book does nothing but serve as fuel for the futile arguments of young earthers, creationists and flat earthers alike. I'd give it 0 if i could."
5,One of my favorites!,"This is an oldie but a goodie. I first got this when i was like 15 back in 91 or something, and I still pop it in now and again. If you like death metal, this is a must have!"
5,Grand Mystery,"Another case for Rafferty and Llewellyn the well matched pair of Celtic detectives from Geraldine Evans. This is my second adventure with this twosome and I have to admit a distinctly pleasurable one. This time they are investigating the murder of an astrologist of note; one Jasper Moon whose head has been caved in with his own crystal ball.Geraldine asks all the right questions constantly keeping her readers on their toes in trying to discover the perpetrator. Each time the case seems to be solved something comes along to make you say `ah, of course, why did I not think of that?'The whole is a work of planning genius keeping each suspect in separate cubicles while the detectives go back and forth, and at times back again, along their merry way. A highly satisfying read, one which Agatha Christie herself would have been proud of. Highly recommended to all lovers of the mystery genre."
4,Love It !!!,"I love this iron, and i love to iron, i know i'm crazy. This will be the second one i've bought. I have purchased more expensive irons in the past and i like this the best. The removable water tank and retractable cord make it perfect."
3,IT BROKE ALREADY!!!!,Our son got this for his bday yesterday!!!! He was having so much fun when 30 minutes later the thing broke in two pieces. We saw the whole thing and he was not being too wild or crazy - just playing. It was SOOOOOOO disappointing. He cried for a long time and couldn't understand what happened. It would be nice if a toy meant for preschoolers was built to withstand preschool play.
2,"Fun, yet NOT AT ALL durable.","So, I did all the research last Christmas to buy our son a weed wacker so he could do yard work just like his Daddy. I saw the reviews that said the shaft breaks and it is just down right not durable. I convinced myself to buy it by thinking, ""Our kid isn't destructive with toys.....and it would really make him happy. I'll take my chance that maybe the others who commented just received a lemon"" Well, sure enough, the shaft broke by New Year's Day and to this day the weed wacker is covered with gray duck tape just to keep the thing together. Bottom line, it is a fun toy, but it is made so extremely bad. Bummer. Read the reviews before purchasing this product, they are real and they will save you money. I notice that John Deere has a trimmer out this year. I believe I may look into the John Deere for this Christmas."
2,Horrible durrability,"I was hesitant to purchase this toy due to the price but I knew my son would absolutely love it. From the time he opened it he ran around and pretended to weed eat like daddy, unfortunately it lasted less than a day. The weed eater shaft has a push button lock that allows it to collapse and expand. Initially, I thought it was a decent idea but after playing with it for about 4 hours the shaft detached from the motor and exposed the wire that runs to the end of the unit. Once this wire becomes detached, the unit will no longer make any noise or do anything. I would be reluctant to buy this product but if you do, I would highly recommend using plastic epoxy or super glue around the collapsible portion of the shaft to keep it from pulling apart."
1,Terrible!... Do Not Buy!,"My 2 year old son fell in love with this toy. That is the reason that I bought trimmer #3 tonight! The first one stopped working only after a few weeks. He was heartbroken, so we thought there would be no chance for the toy to break that easily again... WRONG! The second one did the same thing after a month or two. He is not rough with the toy. It was never dropped or mistreated. It just stops working! It is only a matter of time, I'm sure, before this one stops. I am not an idiot for buying #3. When your 2 year old looks at you with tears in their eyes because their toy won't work, it kinda tugs at your heart-strings! It is crazy that this toy will not last longer than it has for us. Your child will love it... but, you should be prepared to buy about 3 or 4!"
1,waste of money,"I purchased this toy for my grandson and initially he was very excited but that excitement soon turned to disappointment. The toy broke after a few days and very little use. Considering the cost of this toy I expected it to last longer than a week. The toy was not misused or abused, just typical toddler use. It really turned out to be an expensive piece of junk."
2,2 defective - broken before we unpacked it!,"This toy is very poorly made. My son played with his for about 15 minutes before the moving parts stopped moving. I was watching him the entire time and he didn't drop it or bang into anything with it. It just stopped working. We sent it back and got a replacement. This one was already damaged. The button to start it was stuck down and wouldn't work. We sent it back for a refund without even getting it out of the box. It's unfortunate that this toy is so cheaply made, because my 3-year-old son loves to play with it... or at least he did for the first 15 minutes when it was working!"
1,This is a horrible present,"I bought this as gift for my nephew, who loves to act like he is weedeating. Well the toy only lasted for about an hour before it broke. The shaft broke and I plan on returning it. I can't believe a toy that is broken so easily is still being sold. I won't be buying anymore toys made by this company again. He was so upset that it broke, so now he has to pretend with sticks again. If I could have rated this toy any lower I would have given it less than one star."
3,For the price you can't go wrong,"I also own several other solid performance Haier products and for the proice point, I think this AC is a good value. That being said, I also own a Daewoo 5k AC that is a few years old, to compare it. The Haier is MUCH louder, not ultra-quiet as advertised, but the Daewoo is VERY quiet.Unfortunately Costco did not carry Daewoo this year or I would have purchased another one to combat these powerful hot flashes. It is more ecomonical to have addtional cooling in my BR and home office so that I do not have to super cool the whole house. This AC unit is lightweight to carry, easy to install as I did it by myself, and an energy star product. After utilizing the coupon w/ free shipping, I doubt you'll find a better bargain."
4,Thank God for AC,"I bought this product during Amazon Friday Sale and Oh Boy, what a deaL!on top of the company's instant rebate, i got a discounted friday sale as well. The product worked in a snap. I work during the night & sleep during the day - sleeping has never been the same - One problem though, the remote sensor is extra sensitive that it senses my TIVO remote which caused me much trouble everytime i watch TV. I ended up ""covering"" it & control it manually..it's a slight hassle but not a prob...i can deal with it. I called tech support from both company's but mine is a rare problem - i guess that made me unique - duh!Anyways, a great product - a must buy & i say a ""cool"" houseware to own!Go Haier :)"
1,BAD BAD BAD - Do not buy,"Do not buy from this maker. They do not work at all and to top it off the unit that was in the box was not what was described on the outside of the box. Based upon the outside of the box, my unit was supposed to have 4 funtions - it came out of the box with only 2. It was supposed to have 3 fan speeds and it came out of the box with only 2. It is a glorified fan - does not cool past 81 degrees. The company does not back their product and told me that they are packed in China and that Haier is not responsible for what happens in China. Go with another maker unless you are just wanting to have a headache."
2,Let the buyer beware.....,"Haier is a Chinese manufacturer and the quality of its appliances is, at this point, poor. I would spend the extra $70 and go with a brand you can trust (think GE, Kenmore & etc.). I think it is notable that no warranty information on this unit is disclosed."
4,A Good Read,"I never would have believed that I would read a novel about Rap music because I hate it. But, that was before I was introduced to Ace Atkins. I confess I got picked up and carried along with this story. The characterizations are excellent and while it was a little slow to me in spots, it definitely kept me reading. A lot about New Orleans and Mississippi, and since I live on the Mississippi Gulf Coast I am familiar with both, so I truly enjoyed the atmosphere of this read. In short, I will probably read another novel by this author as I did really enjoy this one."
3,Too Slow,"While I have enjoyed other Ace Atkins novels this one was a bit too slow for me.The plot is good and his detail, as always, is magnificent but the plot should have either been spread outor the pace sped up. i will read other books by him as he hooked me with his briliant takeover of the Spencer series, but this one I would only recommend for strong Atkins fans with a lot of time to kill."
3,A blues historian turned investigator,"This novel started out well enough, but then seemed to drift between scenes, some of which seemed a little surreal. It took a while to connect the scenes and characters. This is another indestructable character who seems to stick his nose into various hazards and walk away alive.Nick Travers becomes involved with an old football buddy who is in hock to an evil loanshark. Things are complicated by money missing from a the trust fund set up for a teenage musician. Travers is trying to get the loanshark off his buddy's back, and trying to track down the missing money.The novel did not hold my interest very well, and I found myself skimming to get to the end. A lot of wheelers and dealers, some of whom get whacked. There seems to be a lot of name dropping, both people and places."
4,A great read!,"I stayed up late with this book, couldn't put it down once I got started! I really enjoyed the characters, and Jemima J is someone that almost any woman can relate to. Pick up a copy of this for sure."
3,I'm glad I only paid $3.00 for this book.,"I was excited about the premise of this book, being a large girl myself, but as I read I become more and more frustrated with where things are going. Why do women have to be thin, blonde and beautiful to get anywhere in this world, with men, work or otherwise? I think it sets a terrible example and Jemima doesn't seem to be trying to lose weight in a healthy way. Jemima went from one extreme (food addiction) to another (exercise addiction). You don't just suddenly stop being addicted to food - like any other addiction, it's a hard habit to break, there is no way she just suddenly stopped eating (almost altogether!). I guess I'm taking most of this stuff too literally, it is only a book, after all. I guess I feel let down that even a woman writer can't make her heroin more of a real person than a cartoon character of what society thinks a women should be. I'm more than halfway through the book, but I'm not sure I'm going to finish it."
2,Silly!,"This book had an interesting beginning, but the ending was so far-fetched and silly! I won't spoil it for you, but it was one of those unrealistic ""too perfect"" endings that ties up all the loose ends without really explaining anything. You've already read this book, trust me. If you've read Bridget Jones, you've read a much more clever version of it."
3,I'm a bit confused with the message,"Ok, if you read my review of Babyville you would think i completly loved everything Jane Green has written, but this is the one exception. Dont get me wrong, i didnt hate this book but there were a few things i didnt agree with. I am overweight and have been unlucky in love as well and i really felt like i could relate with Jemima. She was able to put into words how i feel sometimes. Which surprised me because the author is so thin! I was excited for Jemina when she lost so much weight and flew to California to meet Brad. Things were going well at first but slowly started to unravel. I could tell where the book was going and wasnt really surprised by the ending but i was surprised by the message. Is the author trying to tell us that you cannot find love if you are fat? Does that mean i am doomed to a life of loneliness and isolation? I didnt agree with that message and therefore cannot fully support this book."
2,Eh...,"Good idea, poorly executed. Too many things are completely unbelievable for me. Like a woman losing almost 100 pounds in a matter of months, and no telltale signs being left behind. She was overweight all her LIFE, and has no stretch marks, no saggy skin, no drooping breasts, nothing to give Brad (a character as completely unbelievable as Jemima's skin) a clue that she was once what he really considers ""hot""? I don't know anything about the author, but I would bet my next paycheck that she's never been overweight. She's completely clueless. To top it off, the entire book was written by somebody with what seems to be multiple personality syndrome. It gave me a headache, trying to figure out who simple words like ""we"", ""me"" and ""they"" were referring to. That shouldn't be something I have to wonder about!!"
2,"fun, tho dissapointing","i do love these quick ""queen for a day"" stories, uplifting tales of women who gain the lives they dream of thru effort and hard work. as quick and easy a read this was, the point was convoluted. what kind of a 200+ lb. woman drops so much weight and never puts it back on, even when she chills down with the exercise and health food obsession? i was totally offended at a point when it seemed to refer to a size 10 as being ""bigger"". isn't the average size of women in the US a 14? an ironic tale, we learn that even the fat girls are loved by some, but this book makes those who love a larger women out to be really horrid people. as well, everything, of course, works out perfectly in the end. a happy ending, but the means to which the reader arrives at it are nowhere near justification. as for quick summer reads, this definatley was not my favorite."
2,The potential was here.,"This story starts out well enough but breaks down in the middle. It's rolling right along with the lives of Jemima and Ben with the author letting you get inside of their heads and up pops Brad and Jenny. This is when the story totally broke down for me. I can understand Jemima having to come to terms with how she wants to live her life but this was a little over the top. By the time the author works through this she has only a few pages to wrap up the life of the heroine and add a one page epilogue. Disappointing to say the least. Jemima, I would have liked to have known a little more about your ""happily ever after life."""
3,A great beach read!,"As a former fat chick, I totally related to Jemima. I think the author must have at some point been plus-sized.This was a beach read. This isn't stellar literature, nor is it insulting to fat people. It was a fun, easy, engaging read.I do have some points of contention; I don't understand why Brad and Jenny's love had to be peverse. Can't a man get to be friend with, and know and love a fat chick, without there having to be a fetish involved? I thought that cheapened the plot. Also, yeah, I have not met anyone who just decides to lose 100 pounds and become an exercise freak in the course of like 7 months. She could have at least read ""intuitive eating"" and did something like give up dieting forever.But, that didn't take away from the read. I was hesitiant to put it down and eager to start reading again. It was worthwhile and fun."
2,"sorry, but not overly impressed","Jemima J was mostly fluff. I picked up the book and read it because I was intrigued by the cover. I read it expecting the story to have some kind of depth and the character to experience some sort of significant growth and self-acceptance...but sadly, no. I mean, the protagonist loses a ton of weight and dyes her hair golden-blonde...just so she can finally be acceptable to some hunk? The story seemed to glorify standard physical beauty and perfection and equate one's self-worth with being physically stunning. How shallow can a story be? It was a Cinderella story of sorts but not one that's credible or with a message that I necessarily liked. On the other hand, if you are looking for a light 'beach read,' then pick this one up."
2,Just a tad UNBELIEVEABLE!!!,"First off, I liked the book as a whole. It was a fun read, I found myself flying through the end desperately trying to find out what was going to happen to the loveable main character, Jemima Jones.I would NOT recommend this book to my ""chick-lit"" obsessed friends though because of the unrealistic way the character is completely OBSESSED with food and then goes in completely opposite direction, which anyone who is signficantly overweight knows that it is HIGHLY unlikely for that to happen. (And according to the back cover, JJ is 100 lbs. overweight)It seems as though this book was written by a skinny author with skinny friends who really didn't know or never will know what it is like to be that overweight. I'm sorry to be so critical, but with such a ""hot-button"" issue, I'd expect more from a book."
2,"I couldn't put it down, BUT...","It's an odd thing about this book: the ""fat"" Jemima J (who at 217 pounds wouldn't exactly be freakishly obese), is a richly detailed, likable character. The thin Jemima is nauseatingly perfect, and has no sense of humor. And every character other than Jemima is completely two-dimensional--everyone is either great or awful. And why does ""fat"" Jemima have to be such a loser? Sheeeesh! Most fat girls have more than two friends. This book is really clever at the beginning, but it turns into Harlequin drivel about halfway in. The ending was so dull and predictable it drove me nuts. And here's my biggest issue with ""Jemima J."" Why couldn't she have just become a fat swan? If Jemima is so gorgeous when she's thin, chances are she was pretty when she was fat, too. This book is going to make a lot of women feel bad about their bodies, even though it tries not to."
1,Insulting both to intellect as well as morality,"This book starts out promisingly, with the voice of a woman who feels invisible due to her body. I really wanted this book to be good but it was awful. The book was predictable, the literary device of switching from 1st, 2nd, 3rd person was terribly applied (didn't really make sense and you lose the momentum very quickly). I can't believe this book got past the editors. The plot was contrived and terrible, and the last 2/3rds of the book were shallow and repetitive - every other adjective was ""beautiful"", ""stunning"", and ""gorgeous"". This book disrespects and insults women of all sizes, not just overweight women. I had to finish the book for hope of some kind of redemption of character. Finding nothing, threw the book across the room in disgust.If you want a book written with a more respectful voice, read Lady Oracle by Margaret Atwood."
1,A happily married fat chick's review,"I'm ordinarily a huge fan of chick lit and cute, fun, escapist novels. Jemima J is not cute or fun; it is vile, revolting, and vacuous.Jemima J, the story's miserable and annoyingly neurotic heroine, is 5'7"" and 217 pounds, and according to Jane Green, this is a disgusting, fat-lady-in-the-circus type of weight. Jemima loses 100 pounds in 3 months, and her life, which had previously been pathetic and loveless, becomes perfect.Oh Jane Green, thank you so much for writing this book! I now realize that if I were a less disgusting person with one iota of willpower, I, too, could lose weight at an alarmingly unhealthy rate! I see now that as a fat person, I am pathetic and unworthy of love! My appearance is all that matters to anyone! You have shown me the light...NOT!!!!!Anyone intelligent would never get drawn into this book, with its superficial, insulting ideals. Skip this book!"
4,Overall inspiring,"I was a little worried that I was starting to read another dud for the first few chapters but that soon changed. I felt I could relate to Jemima and what she was feeling. Although the ending seemed unrealistical, overall I would say the book was great and very inspiring. Even though things don't always have a fairy tale ending, Jemima J gives you a sense of ""Maybe someday everything will work out for me too""."
3,"A quick, fun read","I'm in graduate school, and I read a lot of academic, heavy books in addition to journals and the Los Angeles Times a few times per week. I was looking for some books that I could read at the gym, waiting for an appointment, or at a cafe, and I decided to give this one a try.Jemima J is a cute, quick book about an English journalist who transforms herself into JJ because she has set up a meeting with a man that she ""met"" on-line. The plot is set in both the young, English social scene and trendy Santa Monica, CA. What makes this book cute is that despite transforming herself physically, JJ remains the same person at heart, and she learns that looks and impressions can be deceiving.This is a light book, fun for the beach or the pool, but if you are looking for heavy symbolism and meaning, don't pick it up."
5,Amazing and inspirational,"I read Jemima J when my friend gave me a copy. I had recently been on a health kick and lost a lot of weight and I related. I understood Jemima. I was Jemima. How she had no self-esteem, felt lonely and repressed and her obsession with America and shallow beauty.The message in this book is not ""if you want your man, lose weight"" - it's embrace who you are. She had the fling with the gorgeous californian and the dream turned sour. That all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood was not what was going to make her happy. Ben liked Jemima for who she was and not what she looked like.I just re-read it seven years later and once again - it's inspired me. You can call it shallow fluff or drivel but I think it's a tale of love and how if you really, really want something you can have it.""Jemima J"" is a masterpiece and Jane Green is a genius. The book spoke to me and it's my favourite of all time. I've also read other books my this author but this is the best."
1,I will not read this author AGAIN!,"Instead of saying that this is a novel about ""ugly ducklings and swans"" why don't they just say ""this is a novel about fat people and skinny people?"" Jane Green has committed a major blunder for womankind with the writing of this book. The plot is stupid: fat girl falls in love with hot guy..loses weight so he (according to her) will love her....etc. etc. (don't want to give away the whole story...) Yes, I read it very quickly, but only because I wanted to see what stupid thing would happen next. (And believe me, stupid things run RAMPANT in this story).This story thrives on the principle that you need to be skinny & beautiful in order to have friends, boyfriends, a good job, a sex life, etc. This is not how the world works. I am offended that a woman would write such a novel like this.Yeah, it's just a story, but why write something so unrealistic that it just winds up sounding stupid?"
1,Disturbingly shallow,"If I could have given this book 0 stars, I would have. What sort of message is this author trying to send when happy endings only come to the thin and beautiful? When I picked up this book, I was expecting the exact opposite message. This book seems to encourage women to strive for anorexia, as is demonstrated from some of the reviews already posted. In addition, the writing style is annoying at best. Don't waste your time, unless you spend 5 hours a day on the stairmaster and only eat lettuce and need fuel for your fantasy that torturing yourself will bring you happiness."
1,You've got to be kidding.,"When I'm told that Jemima is GROSSLY overweight (""At least 100 pounds!!""), and basically spends all of her time fondling her mountains of flab and stuffing bacon into her hole, and not being able to walk a few feet without stopping for a breath, I figured that she had to be over 300. How surprised was I to find out that she was supposed to be 217. Add to my overall astonishment and horror the fact that she lost 80 pounds in three months, with only one passing comment from the author about how unhealthy it is to crash diet and work out obsessively. The message is clear. Fat is bad. Skinny is good, no matter how you get there. Good job, Jane Green. You're obviously a much smarter woman than I, a simple American. Oh, wait--a simple thick headed American.Save your money. Better yet--wait till this nonsense is made into a movie, with some rail thin actress in a fat suit."
4,As entertaining as promised.,"I was promised by Amazon reviewers that this book would make me laugh out loud, and that I would not be able to put it down. And indeed I laughed out loud and was not able to put it down - I read it in 2 days. Some of the plot lines I found a tad unbelievable (such as Jemina's losing the weight as fast as she did, and especially Brad, the internet guy's secret. . .never mind, you have to read the book or I'll give it away) but overall, I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a light, frothy summer read."
3,Too good to be true,"This book is probably Oprah Winfreys autobiography. Great start but awful finish, the chacter goes from toad to princess. Its a nice read and I was able to relate to the main character at the begining but I became disinterested by the end."
3,pleasant but could be better,"After ready some of Jane Green's other work I decided to try out Jemima J, but I didn't find myself completely wrapped up in it like other Brit girl books I have read in the past. I guess it had to do with the descriptions of Jemima, who at 217 lbs may sound fat but being 5'7 would not be as huge as Jane Green made her sound. I did however like the fact that it is a fairy tale story since it takes my mind off of my own present problems in life. Rent it from the library first I would recommend, it's free."
1,WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME READING THIS!?,"If you are interested in reading an unrealistic story about a poor fat girl who suddenly becomes thin and thus, happy, ...well, this book would still be terrible. I'm just glad i checked it out of the library and didn't waste money buying it."
4,Great book to pass on to your friends!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was definately one of those books which I could not put down. It is a great story of a women who transforms herself in order to create the life she wants, but in the process discovers that she is a great person. This book shows what one can accomplish if they really want it, but it also makes you realize that you can not anticipate what perfect is for you. I have already given the book to several friends who have also enjoyed it. It is a fun read."
1,"Decent writing, but awful book.....","I was stunned by the thinly veiled message here that fat is simply unacceptable. Jemima is badly dressed, unhappy and overlooked as a fat woman -- and suddenly becomes chic and people love her when she's thin.... This is just part of the anorexia train..... Not a power book for women AT ALL."
5,Superb,This book is truly amazing. It's for light reading and it's quirky. It's easy reading and I can't wait for Jane Green's next book.
2,Don't let your daughter read this book,"Even though this book is British, it can still be obtained in the U.S. and cause detrimental effects on younger and even older women. In this book it seems that an eating disorder is glorified, and that by becoming thin one is happy. Only in the epilogue does the author state that now Jemima is a ""normal"" size, a 10,and she is extremely happy. Why couldn't she attain her goals when she was overweight? And how bad is it for girls to read that a boy didn't like her when she was overweight but feel in love with the skinny version???"
2,horrid,"I usually pick up any book I see and start reading it. And how I wished I never picked this one. It was somewhat interesting at first, hearing Jemima J's side of the story about how a fat english girl's life is. As the story progresses however the plot becomes more and more unlikely. Up until the conclusion where it just IMPOSSIBLE. I finished, thinking what a waste of time. I give credit to how it kept me reading until the end, but maybe that just made it even worse. Do not pick this book up unless those inconceivable and hardly possible chic storys interest you."
4,Excellent reading!,"I couldn't put this book down! I definitely give this book a thumbs up. I'm looking forward to Jane Green's ""Mr. Maybe""."
5,Completely enjoyable!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's just a bit of a departure from the slew of single women books that are following in Bridget Jones' footsteps. It takes quite a while for JJ to get as ballsy (can I say that?), as Bridget is from the beginning. JJ has weight issues, confidence issues, men issues, food issues - she's just sort of a mess. But all of those things and more are part of her charm. I could completely relate to her, although I've never had to fight the weight problems to quite the extent that she did.I appreciate that JJ doesn't really do things right, but who does? She does learn and so do the rest of us. Don't expect any great moral lesson, just a tiny one but it's still important. Confidence in oneself and your own self worth are very valuable, no matter your size."
2,Way past a little unbelievable....,"This could have been a great story...unfortunately, it was ruined for me by a completely implausible plot. When Jemima loses weight (and shows signs of a serious eating disorder) she appears to lose her mind as well....how else to explain her relationship with Brad? I greatly enjoy creative stories, but this book was completely unbelievable."
2,"A quick read, but rather heinous","I bought this book in London to read on the the 15 hour flight back to the states. I finished it on the plane. It was a rather quick and painless read, but oh so lame. I felt that women were depicted very poorly, especially overweight women. Green harldy touches on the self-esteem/mental side of being overweight, and chooses to focus instead on the more shallow aspects (i.e. thin = happy, love, money). I didn't HATE the book, but I felt it was poorly written, and many of the characters were undefined. JJ was very unlikable because she was so shallow. A decent book to read if you have several hours to kill and there is nothing better around. Otherwise, avoid it."
1,Unrealistic and insulting,"This book is insulting to all full figured women. She never loved herself as she was - she had to get skinny (in an unhealthy way) to appreciate herself. She was fine the way she was (and 217 lbs on a 5'7"" frame is not ""100 lbs overweight""). Jemima (sorry - could not STAND the name, reminded me of bottled syrup) never suffered the consequences of starving herself and over - exercising. Any woman engaging in that behavior would have collapsed or lost hair. If you want to read an empowering book, read ""Good in Bed"". Forget this pap."
1,"If there were a 1/2 star rating, this book would get it","I don't understand how anyone at a notable publishing firm could read this and think it is a good novel. It reads like a high-school afterschool special but the ending is actually more contrived. Impossible, you say? No! It's not.You can read the other negative, more truthful reviews to understand how conflicted this novel is. I won't waste your time with that. Just be certain you are, in fact, a real masochist before picking this up."
1,Appalling,"Why oh why do people like this? This is the most narrow-minded book I have ever read! According to Jane Green, fat women are unattractive, which means that they can't have good jobs, boyfriends and a life. I have a lot of great overweight friends. They are all confident and have lives. Oh, and I also hate the stereotypes in this book. For instance, she says that Americans are thick-headed. I so disagree with that ignorant statement. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Have to chime in.....,"Read it in 2 days and was sorry I did. I too skipped pages, as a previous reviewer mentioned, and it made no impact on the predictable and boring storyline. If you're a real, intelligent woman with an actual life please skip this book. PLEASE no more ""single-chick"" books, esp. those set in the UK - the British witticisms and jargon are not nearly enough to save these stories."
1,Terrible,"I am a big fan of the new escapist Cinderella genre, but this book is the worst I've ever read. The characters are beyond one-dimensional -- in fact, they are defined 100% by their appearances. Pretty strange for a book in which the ostensible theme is that appearances shouldn't matter. Even if you are just looking for mindless fluff (and, I say, there is nothing wrong with that), you should look elsewhere."
1,one of the worst books i've ever read,"it's been awhile since i read this book but i remember being severely disappointed; aside from the story being completely unrealistic, it ends with a muddy fairy tale wrap up that reinforces the idea that losing weight and changing herself to capture a man was exactly the right solution, though it wasn't the man who inspired her to do it in the first place.dumb, dumb, dumb."
3,100 pounds overweight??,"I felt I couldn't give it too few stars because I did read the whole thing within a couple of days; it did keep my attention as fluff at least.After reading so much about how horribly overweight she was - the extra chins, the tent-like clothing, the back cover says she is at least 100 pounds overweight... You find out she is 5'7"" and weighed 217 pounds. Nowhere are you going to find the ideal weight for someone of that height to be 117 pounds. There are websites where you can create a virtual model of yourself - go there and type in 5'7"" and 217 pounds. Obviously that doesn't give you multiple chins and the inability to get around comfortably. Clearly the author is stick thin and has no idea what that height and weight would look like. This book does a great disservice to so many women who already have a negative body image."
4,Great Boooook!,This is the third book by Jane Green that i've read and she's such a great writer who writes about things that teenagers or even people (mostly girls) a little older can relate too. It goes through the struggles of an overweight women trying to impress an attractive guy. The book is empowering and lets everyone know they can do anything if they put there mind to it. It's great. I recommend this book to any girl having self esteem issues.
4,The talk of jemima j.,"Well this book is really a four star book beacause. As you first read it told me how open the character was going to be with her self and the person reading the book. Another reason that made me really want to go on with reading this book is that i can relate to what she's going through. Like with her weight and finding mr.wright. And always feeling down i can really relate to what she thinks and feels about her self and the world around her. But as i start reading on I saw that she started gaining confidence in her self and taking control of her eating habits,losing weight and finding out how jealous her roomates were of her. Beacause of how she changed her life around and started being the real jemima j."
3,"Slow, but had it's moments...","I was recommended this book by a friend of mine, and thought it to be quite funny at times, yet slow to read. Here's a clue to all the women who found it offensive to heavier women: a size 10 in the UK is like a size 14 in the US."
4,"Quick, charming read","I was attracted to this book by the cover and the summary on the back cover. I read the first five pages and thought it was pretty good. So I bought it and I read it very quickly. So it isn't exactly probable (a woman losing 100 pounds in 3 months), but it IS fiction, right? I enjoyed it and was kept on the edge of my seat, waiting for the ending. The ending, to me, was good and much like a fairy tale. This book is definitely not for people under the age of 16, because of the frequent sexual references. However, I would reccommend it to any woman who is single and looking for that fairy tale relationship with the man of your most secret fantasies. Overall, a good, mature read."
4,nice,The book is in good condition. It did arrive within a week. And I have been starting to read this book and it's getting more and more interesting.I think I'm gonna fall in love with the story like I did with Jemima Jones.
2,"Badly written, full of cliches and predictable","My interest was high when I spotted this book. I am a woman-of-size who has a lifetime of experiences making peace (or not) with my size. But after a few pages, I was disappointed by the bad writing, trite scenarios, and unrealistic dialog. The idea of a big woman as heroine is great, but this vehicle was not my cup of tea (sorry, Jemima)."
2,an immoral moral,"If you're a normal girl, skip this book. Although cleverly written, the moral of the story is: If you are thin to the point of being unhealthy & obsessive--you'll get the guy. For shame."
5,Great read,"This is a great read - honest, funny, quirky and made me laugh. Definitely chick lit of first class. Its a feel good story for strong women."
3,Just ok,I have expected more form best selling book and a good sense of humored English writer. Maybe I should not. Because the book is ok but it is not good enough. Jemima goes to Baywatch then we writer tries to give a message to reader. Why does she need to do that?
3,"Not bad, but there are better ""chic lit"" books out there...","Jemima J was not what I expected it to be. Alot of people had reccommended it to me and said it was a Must Read, but I didn't feel the same about it. I am a big fan of all the ""chic lit"" books that are so popular right now (Shopaholic..etc). Jemima J was just a book that was okay. I didn't have that same ""getting sucked into the story"" feeling that other books have done. The worst part of the book was that the book was in the 3rd person. It made it awkward to read at some parts and doesn't help the reader relate to the character as much. Overall, I would say if you just needed some reading and you are totally out of books than it would be good. If not, go check out some other books that are much better (Nanny Diaries, Shopaholic Series)"
3,"cute, but a little disheartening......","i liked the book first off, because i could relate to the ""fat"" jemima and some of the stuff that she said and thought was so true that it was funny. the only thing that upset me was the characters rapid (and very unbelieveable) weight loss and the fact that when she was thin, she got everything she wanted. i was almost rallying for ben *not* to like her in the end. he never loved her until she was thin and that's not exactly fair. don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the book. it was a fun, light read. makes me want to exercise. :) but coming away from it, i'm feeling a little, honestly, fat. she was only 204 pounds people. that's what i am. that's a size 16. i don't think that calls for the quadruple chins reference and huge orange shirts. i can't help but think it would be more believeable if a skinny person hadn't written it."
3,California Dreamin'?,"While I was inspired by Jemima's quest to lose weight and enjoyed all of the theoretical questions dotted throughout the novel, I have to agree with a few of the other reviewers who believe that Green is sending a mixed message. Sure, Jemima isn't happy with herself and feels she is being discriminated against; BUT, Green illustrates her journey through self-discovery as though it were as easy as signing a gym membership form. I thought this was a bit too simplistic, and Green missed a great opportunity to expand upon her theme. This novel was a nice departure from all of the self-loathing singleton stories that are out there- We are able to sympathize with Jemima, who is a genuine character. But come on...We knew how the story would end, didn't we?"
2,A beach read only,"Predictable, cliche-ridden but a quick read. Written mostly in the first-person from Jemima's perspective, the book occasionally lapses into a greek-chorus-like third-person omnicient which can be intrusive and ruins the flow of the book. It's as if the author knew she was writing a slim fantasy and wanted to give it some moral or literary heft by using this device.And if you have ever lived in Los Angeles, prepare for some unintended laughs - inexplicable geography and lazy stereotyping of LA denizens.That being said, Jemima J. is a nice, light little fairy tale. I really didn't hate it - it just doesn't stand out from the rest of the single-gal books out there, or add anything to the genre. And the fact that all of the major characters either are or become physically stunning totally contradicts the supposed theme that beauty isn't everything."
1,Skip It!,"This book was a ... disappointment. Was excited to dive into it, and just let down overall. Shallow and stereotypical... Borrow it from library, but save your money."
1,Insipid and muddled,"I'm not impressed. I read the teaser on the back of the book and was really looking forward to the read. It started out on a good track but I found the direction the story took to be completely implausible (it would have made more sense to me if on the last page it ended with - and then Jemima woke up from her dream). I also did not like the way the book was narrated. The author kept switching from first person to third person. She should have chosen one and stuck with that.""Jemima felt happy today, you could tell by the smile on her face"".'I am happy today' thought Jemima, as she smiled'Why do I need to read that twice?Ugh. Overall I was disappointed. It read like an R rated Sweet Valley High book."
2,so so,"I liked the book, but the author has no idea what it is like to be a fat person. i weigh in at about 200 lb and i don't think i am 100 lb over weight (which is what the author says jemmia is) if jemmia weighed only 100 lb for her height she would be sick not healthy. i also don't think people stare at me like i am a big gross blob, i know i am over weight but 200 lb is not that big as the author makes it out to be. go to a web sight and type in jemmima's height and it will tell you she should weigh around 160 not 100"
3,Great Beach Read,"This is a perfect book to take on vacation and read while lounging on the beach. It can be read in a few days (hours if you're ambitious) and is a straight to the point, modern-day fairy tale. Which is not a bad thing, but if you're looking for a novel that makes you think about the purpose of life, this isn't the one for you. It's simply a nice little romance in which we root for the underdog, even though we know in our heart of hearts that she will most likely come out on top anyway.I gave this book three stars for 2 reasons, the first being that the book was a little TOO predictable and there weren't many surprises. The second being the way the author kept changing the point of view of the narrator. It would jump from character to character, first person to third person, and got a bit confusing at times. But all in all, it's a sweet ""chick book"" and I'm sure that the paperback version will fit neatly into your beachbag."
4,Stick with YOU,"Many people see this book as an overweight woman who dreams of becoming thin and finding the perfect man. The thing about this book is the fact that once she became JJ and became so thin she realized all the negativity about being thin, or overweight. Both have their positives, but the fact still remains that she understood all that came with both, embraced it, and still remembered who the real Jemima is. I took a lot out of this book and I hope that all who read it dig a little deeper to see and understand the real picture."
1,the worst book ever,"This was the most disgusting piece of trash that I've ever read in my life and believe me I plan to never read anything by this author again. This book doesn't deserve one star but since thats the lowest on amazon one can give a book I'll go with that. For some people who think twilight books are horrible this just shows you it can be worst with an author that doesn't research, stereotypes throughout a book about Americans, being overweigh, people in general.I don't know why some authors think that they can write trash like this and called it literature this novel is not witty or romantic in any way just a pathetic excuse of writing.Although this is the 1st book of the authors I've read it is also my last. My hard earn dollars are not going to be spend in anyway to help this women write more nasty crazy etc.. books."
3,Left it at the beach,"I bought this as a vacation read, forced myself to finish it, and deliberately left it behind when I went home. Although a lot of the details and scenes are funny, the plot is cartoonish (at best), and the narrative voice, which switches back and forth between first person and omniscent, gets annoying after the first couple of chapters. This book should have gone straight to paperback and onto the racks at airport bookstores."
2,A Letdown,"I just read my first Jane Green novel, Mr. Maybe, and I really enjoyed it, so I thought that I would enjoy Jemima J as well. What a disappointment! It keeps switching back and forth between the first person and third person, which really kills the flow of the story. The main character has no personality and no friends, until she loses weight. All the characters are one dimensional and shallow. The plot is not very believable. The author keeps saying how beautiful and fit the women in Los Angeles are, so why would the ""gorgeous"" gym owner, who has access to these beautiful, fit women all day long, need to go on the internet to find a beautiful, fit woman? It just doesn't make sense.Skip this book and read Mr. Maybe. Or better yet, go back and reread the Bridget Jones books. They are way more entertaining, even the second or third time around."
2,Depressing and Horrible,"Granted this book was easy to read. Also, it was not too hard to follow. It was however, deeply flawed.1) She has to change her LOOKS to be loved. The man whom she later dates (the jerk from her old job) and marries (I believe?) ONLY does so when he sees her new LOOK.2) It is NOT healthy nor possible to lose that much weight when she was training. PLUS--a size 12 is NOT BIG! In the US, that would be a size 10!! Is Green trying to tell us that we have to be thin in order to be loved?I hated this book!!"
3,"apparently, only weirdos love fatties","While I enjoyed most of the book and liked the author's writing style, I must say that I was put off with the ending. Trying not to give anything away here, but I must say that the dramatic crisis the author places Jemima in can only lead one to the conclusion that only weirdos like heavy girls, and the ultimate goal of anyone should be to lose the weight. The author ends with some pat statements that what counts is on the inside, etc., but, really, the biggest creep in the book is the one that liked big women.With that said, the book was an entertaining read to a point."
3,Just Okay,"I'd never heard of this author until a co-worker lent me the book to read saying it was the story of her life, well the beginning of the book was. Speaking of the beginning of the book, that was the best part. Jemima was believable and funny even when she started losing weight. But when she goes to California to meet her hunk it is way too far fetched for me. It started to drag and get somewhat boring. And what about the word ""gorgeous"" how many times can the author use that word to describe every guy Jemima meets. The word was well over used and I recommend she get a thesaurus. I am going to give this author another chance by reading something else she wrote."
4,"Great, with one major fault","I thought Jemima J was hysterically funny & enjoyable to read. As a character, her life is interesting and so similar to so many women's lives. The problem is this: throughout the story the author tries to make the reader see how Jemima has been ignored/overlooked/cast aside because of her weight, and how unfair this is. BUT THEN SHE LOSES WEIGHT AND PEOPLE TAKE HER MORE SERIOUSLY! Where is the lesson to the general public that has been holding her back here?The story is good and has an interesting (albeit unexpected) turn and this one is worth the read, if you can get past what I considered a fault."
3,Don't waste your time....,"I don't understand the hype of this pointless book. The places that should prove some sort of interest are rushed. I suppose the simple sentance structure and 3 hour read make it ideal for light reading. Personally, I'm mad that I wasted 3 hours of my day. Bring on good literature."
3,this book should be taken lightly,"its entertaining, all in all a good read. i enjoyed it, but it shouldn't be taken seriously. the whole los angeles part is extremely fake, trust me, L.A. isn't like that at all. (i live in a suburb of L.A.) but it was a good read, and i enjoyed the jokes and if anyone wants to be inspired to lose weight, i'd suggest it. hmmm the writing is pretty good, but the way the author switches between 3rd and 1st person is mediocre. her voice and style stay the same.. yet she is switching between 1st and 3rd person? she should have tried to switch her tone depending on which point of view she was using. all in all, an inspiring, make-believe book. hehe!"
3,It's quite good actually,"the first time I read the book it was inspirational , I refer specifically to the part where she manages to slim down by such an alarming degree. It is funny, hilarious and tried to give guys some credit in this book. However, a warning, the exercise regime she does is a bit unbelievable. Perhaps a little too much. But, who am I ? I am no expert. Just read the goddamn book already !"
3,"""Oh, PLEASE!""","My anorexic sister recommended this book. I should have known better! She related so well with Jemima - what anorexic woman wouldn't? The completely unrealistic premise of this book was only one of its many irritations. I could barely tolerate the bouncing back and forth between first and third person writing. It made the plot even more implausible. Jemima losing 100 pounds and becoming cover-model beautiful in no time at all was just too sugary sweet. The internet boyfriend needing her as arm-candy to disguise his love (lust-fetish) for his hugely obese lover was the lamest ""plot line"" that I have ever read. My 10-year old son could think of better. I prefer ""fairy tales"" such as ""Pride and Prejudice"" written with passion, intelligence and scathing truthfulness. Fortunately for me, I read so quickly that I didn't spend too much time on this waste of paper. Jane should stick to magazine writing."
2,Highly Unrealistic,"Even if this story is supposed to resemble the Cinderella fairy tale, the plot is still overly exaggerated. First off, there is no way Jemima could have lost that much weight in such a short amount of time. Second, the prince charming parallels are rather rediculous. I understand the point that Green was trying to convey through this story- that good things can happen to anyone, no matter who or what they look like- but the story does not support this idea. Green is telling her readers that essentially they have to become the picture of perfection first before dreams start to come true. It is books/movies/images like this that help give woman such low self esteems. Writers should be focusing on characters that are real, and who stay real. NOt ones that submerge themselves into crash diets, and then find that life suddenly turns perfect."
3,Great book - one problem,"This was a really fun, compulsively readable book that I could not put down. As I read I kept thinking, ""oh my God, this could be me"" - right down to the internet relationship. What other reviewers have written is true, this is a great book, except for one thing - the message is a little skewed in that only when Jemima becomes thin do things start to go right for her, and does she get the attention of Ben, the man she's always loved. This book just reinforces bad body image for women, in that you must wait until you are thin to be happy (and nearly starve yourself doing it if necessary). This is the kind of media message we should be trying to eradicate and overcome, not reinforce."
1,Horrible and offensive,"Please, please, please don't read this book. If you are larger than a size 2 you will want to throw yourself out the window by the time you've reached the third chapter. This is so offensive and mean-spirited. The main character is described as a gigantic, disgusting, sex-depraved (she's so fat and ugly no man would even touch her) hideous beast of a woman. She has no friends. She eats like 15 bacon sandwiches for a mid-morning snack. She is so fat and lazy she can barely stand up and walk across the room to answer the ringing phone. Then they tell you how much she weighs. She's 200 pounds, 5'7, and a size 14. Um, excuse me, that's NOT that fat. Not at all.If you want to read a good ""big girl"" novel that's not offensive and that will touch your spirit, read The Next Big Thing by Johanna edwards, Good in Bed by Jennier Weiner, or Inappropriate Men by Stacy Balis. All so much better."
1,Warning: Not recommended for impressionable audiences,"This novel has a negative message about loosing weight for the wrong reasons. Reading this book will give you poor self esteem based on the way that ""fat"" people are portrayed in this book. In my opinion there are no possitive messages in this book. How many times does the ugly duckling into a man seeking swan scenario have to play out in novels that are geared towards women. There is no room for diversity in this book so if you do not fit into the western media idiology of what is beautiful dont read this book, it might make you depressed. Why does Jemima's character need a man so bad? This book is reinforcing the idea that women arent good enough the way they are and that they need to change in order to be accepted."
1,Very Disapointing!,"Honestly, one of the worst books I have ever read. Jemima, completely obsessed with food--so much that she eats 2 bacon sandwiches on her way to work every morning--suddenly does a complete 180 overnight and drops 100 lbs over the course of a couple months. Her regimen? Eat iceberg lettuce and exercise 2 hours a day, at least. Then, and only then, does she find true love (sigh).In the beginning of the book, I was quickly bored by Jemima's whining (and Green's writing). By the end of the book, if I had to read one more chapter about Brad and Jemima's daily routine of coffee, rollerblading, or what a beautiful couple everyone thought they were, I was going to scream. The book could have easily been 50 pages shorter.A complete waste of time. A poor excuse for ""chick lit""."
2,Horrible for your self esteem...,"I feel like I have two reviews of this book depending on how much I actually think about it. The first review is my opinion when I don't look too deeply into the book. It's cute, irritating sometimes with the change in narration (from first person to third) and overall a no brainer beach read.My second review goes something like this.---Possible Spoiler---Fat girl loves incredibly gorgeous boy, boy doesn't notice girl, girl loses 100 pounds, boy falls in love with girl, they get married and live happily ever after.How's that for a message sent in a book? Be thin or else you'll live a miserable lonely life.Overall I can think of better books to spend your time reading."
2,Does Losing Weight Mean Losing Character?,"This book began with so much potential. Jemima J was witty, amusing and any woman could relate to her on some level. But once our heroine looses the weight she also lost her personality and became a bland woman with nothing else on her mind besides men and food.Besides the unfolding of this story, another problem I had with this book was how it made anorexia seem so normal and even necessary for weight loss. And the fact that men were attracted to her once she became so thin that she attained a ""boyish"" figure was a disturbing, yet untrue, message.Sorry Jane Green, but Jemima J was a disappointment."
1,A Good Read....If You're 12,"I bought this book shortly after the ""Bridgit Jones"" phenom, thinking it would be a fun read.Wrong! I was reading books with more intellect and better writing styles than ""Jemima J"" when I was 12. To make a long story short, it's a very bland read with a forgettable character, an unreal plot (Jemima drops 100 lbs. in three months), and dialogue that is so bad it's almost amusing.Jane Green is making a small fortune writing awful books. If you're over the age of 14, hopefully you'll be smart enough not to contribute to it."
1,Don't bother....Bridget is far superior!!,"Being a loyal fan of Bridget Jones, I was interested in reading something that claimed to be similar in nature. I thought it was a decent story, but as people have already mentioned, quite unrealistic (which, granted books don't have to be), but the idea of losing that much weight in such a short time is unsafe and unlikely...and let's be honest, the skin doesn't follow that quickly. I can understand the appeal of the ""ugly duckling"" becoming a ""swan""...who hasn't wished the same thing? However, beyond the unbelievable story, I found the writing style distracting and at times unbearable. Stick with Bridget, she is much funnier and Helen is a far superior writer."
5,Uplifting!,"The beginning of the book is a little hard to follow because the author bounces around narrating but, this fades as you get further. It's a little predictable but that's easy to overlook with such an uplifting romance. I wanted more information in the conclusion, it's one of those books that you don't want to end. Perfect chic book, get a hot cup of coffee and let Jemima become your best friend."
5,Loved IT!!!,I absolutely loved the book. Randomly picked it up for my airplane ride and couldn't put it down. Easy reading and intriguing story. Very humorous as well...
5,Hot Stuff!,"Okay, I've been there - that insatiable desire to be thin. Though, it is not quite so insatiable as the desire to have some of that mint ice cream...Jemima (not JJ!) is an inspiration to anyone who ever wanted to get motivated about anything! She doesn't play it off like it is easy, or that she's realy a thin person trapped in a fat body - she is Jemima, through and through, a thoroughly hilarious character that made me laugh out loud. Give it a read!"
3,Don't Read While Drunk,"Do not read this book drunk. The author changes tense so much it will make you nauseous. First person, third person, back to first person -- but a different character. You are in one person's head, then suddenly hovering just under the ceiling above the action of the story, then BAM! you are plopped into another character's head. It is like being psychic with ADD.The story is sweet and addicting. Who doesn't love the underdog finally winning? I do have to take exception with the book marketer who wrote ""...with a surprise ending readers won't see coming."" I'd like to buy this person a dictionary so he or she could look up the definition of the word ""surprise."" They clearly have no idea what it means. Not only is the ending not a surprise (not that there is anything wrong with that!), but it is foreshadowed wtih such a heavy hand that I feld increasingly annoyed for it to happen!"
1,There goes another 11.95 I'll never get back...,"This novel started out with good intentions, but then exploded in a fiery useless flame by chapter two. I finished the whole thing hoping and praying that it would get better, but alas it was all in vain. I'm not sure what message this book is trying to get across, but whatever it was, it landed a few miles short of it's destination. If you think that snagging a good looking television star boyfriend and becoming a ""curvaceous"" size ten is the road to happiness, then this book is for you. However if you crave anything semi-substantial or meaningful in your literature, stear clear."
2,Not for everyone.,I didn't really enjoy this book. It wasn't particulary wellwritten and I found the constant switching from first to thirdand even second persons to be rather annoying. I would notrecommend this book to those who have little patience for authorswho have not honed their writing skills.
4,Definitly Recommend this book!!!,"Jemina J is a must read! I already read Jane Green's Mr. Maybe and loved it as much. Green is an awesome writer who takes you on a non-stop journey though a fantasy world. Jemina J stuggles with her weight and all that goes along with it. I love how Green decribes the characters and their lives. This is an easy, fast read and I am already onto Green's other novel Bookends!!!"
2,you can pass on this one...,"after hearing from several of my friends that i'm going to ""love this book"" and i won't be able to put it down, i decide to read it, having borrowed it from a coworker. i realized very quickly how easy it was for me to skim over pages at a time. (mind you, i NEVER skim books) the first/third person switch was not well done, and it was highly annoying when, in the third person, the author would write ""jemima jones"" or ""ben williams"" redundantly over sentences. basically i felt that most of the story written in third person could already have been understood by the reader. i really didn't see the point in having both third and first person narratives.it was lighthearted and an easy read. if you're not looking for substance, then it's a decent book. but there's definitely better ones out there.just my two cents."
4,excellent book,"This was the first work of fiction I have read in a long time and I thought it was excellent. I actually loved how the characters, however sometimes predictable and overly coincidental, come into contact with one another because it still kept me in suspense, with hope of what would happen next. I couldn't see most of what was coming and became thoroughly engaged in jemima's thoughts and could not put the book down until I had finished it and then I still wanted more. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for light reading with a good plot and lots of laughter. I know I will be on the lookout for similar types of books from now on. Read it and enjoy!!"
2,Not so good,"I thought this book was kind of an insult to larger women. Obviously the author is not one, and it showed. The ending said Jemima is now a size 10, a voluptuous woman. Since when is size 10 considered voluptuous?"
2,some cheese with your whine?,"For all of you who are whining about Ben only liking JJ after she lost weight - here's a newsflash: SHE liked HIM because he was physically fit and attractive! The book is not saying that overweight people can't find love at all, just that they can't find it with a hottie unless the hottie is into large women. Why is that so difficult to understand? We are hardwired to admire physical attractiveness - and physically unattractive people will generally not be able to pair up with those who are, and they should not whine about it, because they are liking those people for how THEY look! It's pure hypocrisy. I had absolutely no problem with this book's take on the issue, I thought it was spot on."
1,Major mixed messages,"I love this sort of single-girl Brit-fic, so I was really looking forward to Jemima J. I was incredibly disappointed, however, to discover that the author seems to have missed the point of her own message. Yes, Jemima undergoes the transformation that's standard for these heroines, but she is rewarded ONLY because she's now thin, not because she's become a stronger, more confident person. Her ""happy ending"" is happy because her secret crush finally notices her...because she's thin! Besides the stereotypical presentation of a fat woman who has no life, no friends and no personality until she loses weight, the pathetic codicil at the end of the book assuring readers that Jemima eats ""what she wants, when she wants...in moderation"" feels like a tacked-on legal disclaimer. Green's breezy prose only partially masks the questionable underpinnings of her plot."
3,Dissapointed,"This story came very highly recommended as a quick summer read, I was prepared to love it. I emphasized with Jemima from the very beginning of the book. Where other people have commented that the change between first and third person bothered them I thought it was a creative way to show another point of few. Overall though, what I thought was going to be a heart warming learn to love yourself and others will love you story ended up being a starve yourself, exercise to the point that your trainer is concerned and everyone will love you when you are skinny. I think she could have had a couple of good stories Ben the friend turned lover, internet relationship that wasn't what you thought, weight struggle story and the love yourself and others will love you story. I think she over did the plot and went the wrong way with the overall feeling of the story. You would be better off with Can You Keep A Secret"
2,Eh,"I was in the mood for a light read after reading Orwell's 1984, and I certainly got what I was after. But unfortunately, it wasn't a particularly well written book. My biggest hangup was the continual switching between first and third person -- I had a really hard time getting into the book because of that. I also didn't quite believe some of the key elements of the plot (for example, the part with the guy in LA and what he's truly after, for those of you who've read it). I have a very hard time not finishing a book once I've started it, but I did seriously consider it with this one."
2,How cliched can you get?,"Although this book had its fine moments, for the most part it was cliched and predictable. Also, it set a disturbing example of the ways to weight loss and fitness. Although it was incredibly wonderful that she lost the weight, it would have been nice if she had taken just a little longer to do it healthily."
2,Not Good but Might Work if You Must Have A Bridget Stand-in,"I picked up this book because I was missing a good book on sex and the single life. However, that is not what I got. The author and publisher are feverishly exploiting the Bridget Jones inspired Sex and the Single London life craze. The book doesn't pass muster on any level -- story-telling, narrative, characters, etc. Its not horrible and I got through it but I want to agree with some of the other reviews here, it could have been much better. Most annoying was the switching randomly back and forth between first and third person. And the final plots twists were so nonsensical as to defy even the wildest imagination. A good Cinderella story it is not--but if nothing else is around and you have to read about a young woman living in London--it might do."
2,im not sure what i think of this book,"its a good read, thats without a doubt. but im not sure about the moral.sure the girl wanted to make herself more appealing to the guy, but at what cost? sure she was ""happier"" when she was thin, but she wasnt really happy. sure the men looked at her, but she didnt have the inner beauty going on. and what really irked me was that she was a size 16 and ""huge"" ......um...... no. sizes 12-16/18 are NORMAL in this day and age.and the ending of the book? the elusive ben only noticing her because she was a size 2..even though she had been in his life way back when she was a size 16? i was not impressed with ben at that point, nor with jemima for falling for him in all his shallowness.this book was good..... until the end"
2,Too unrealistic,"I picked this book up because I felt like the girl in the story--overweight. But she solves her problem too easily. There's no struggle. Despite the fact that she has no drive, once she decides she's going to do it, she, well, just does. How convenient. Also, she never really learns anything. She teaches that thin=beautiful, but only borders on learning that that's not the right attitude. The character is lame, naive, while at the same time confident and determined. She doesn't develop into one or the other, rather is at any point in time any of those things. The book resolves too quickly and is completely unrealistic.To top it off, you know after about the third chapter exactly how the book will turn out. Very, very typical fairy tale story.If you want a better book about conquering your weight in your 20s, read Good in Bed. Much better and much more in tune to the thoughts that go through a woman's head."
3,Not a good book for women over 110 pounds...,"I was thrilled to see this book at the store...I thought to myself, ""Finally! A book written with a realistic-sized woman as the heroine!"" WRONG. Jemima is a wonderful person throughout the book, but the author leads the reader to believe that being fat is a major obstacle to having a happy life.Being a ""voluptuous"" woman myself (a happy size 12), I was highly disappointed to get to the point in the book where Jemima practically starves herself to death, just to impress some stupid guy.The book held my interest, though, so I give it 3 stars. At least I was able to finish it."
3,Such harsh criticism...,"I just want to say that many of the reviews on here are way too harsh. I don't think Jane Green was meaning to convey that the life of an obese woman is lonely and pathetic. The point is this was Jemima's story, this was Jemima's experience. Her weight held her back from the life she wanted, but that's not to say that this is the experience of everyone who has ever been overweight. It's not fair to criticize Ms. Green's story as though she were trying to paint a picture of the typical fatty's existence. I honestly think Jane Green did an excellent job of showing the inner struggles, the guilt, and the insecurities that can go along with being overweight. Again I don't think the author was intending to show that this is the experience for EVERYONE but that this was how Jemima felt about it and how she dealt with her situation."
2,could we have more stereotypes in one book?,"I recently discovered Second Chances by Jane Green and liked the book so I was pleased to find this one but wow.....basically if you are a fat girl you have 3 double chins, could never have had a boyfriend, and are boring. The twist in the book was ok but little else was the roomates are vapid copies of ugly step sisters and the two girl friends of our lead are interesting relationships for what they play in the book but there isn't enough time spent on developing a likability and really the overall message is excessive exercise and dangerous near anorexia eating habits pay off."
4,Entertaining,"I enjoyed this book about Jemima J, an overweight lady who tries to find love on the internet. I am surprised by some of the reviews slating this book and calling it unbelievable. It's not suposed to be believable, it's fantasy. I thought it was funny and I got the humor in the story."
4,Has its flaws but it is nice escapism,"Well, it is chick lit for sure, and unrealistic, but it was fun to read and I've actually read it twice now! It is pretty much a fiction version of all those shows like Biggest Loser and Extreme Make-over Weight Loss Edition. Not how it really happens, but a little inspiring and gets you dreaming a little bit."
4,Cute Story but kind of a tall tale,"I have read multiple reviews on this site and I can honestly say I was surprised. I thought there would be a lot of people that found this story at least entertaining. Probably not the best beach read ever written but I thought that most of the story was quite cute and heartwarming. Jemima is a person that is relateable, her problems are also but I can see where a reader can get frustrated with the blurred line between relateable and down right impossible fantasy. If you want a light hearted and easy read grab it....just make sure you get it from the library where you don't have to pay for it."
3,Jemima J,This book was a book club book for me. It was a fun read with a little twist that you didn't expect. It was worth the read and I enjoyed it
2,"Escapist Chick Lit, About Average for the Genre","A fluffy, chick lit book in the same vein asBridget Jones's Diary(right down the last name!) about love, weightloss (and gain) and the typical chick-lit fare. All in all, it was fun, but in an odd writing style, switching from first, to second, to third person P.O.V. willy-nilly. This really grated on my nerves and detracted from the rather lighthearted story. I have read a few of her other books in the past, and didn't recall this as an issue... This just wouldn't be my go-to choice for a light, romantic novel."
2,not what I expected,"I found myself starting to like the characters in this book, but I at the same time I found myself disliking the author...if that makes any sense. I don't think she really had a sense of what she was talking about, maybe those who have never been obese shouldn't try to explain it. Also, I didn't like the overall morale of the story...I you do something dangerous that could cause you serious health problems but makes you thin, all your dreams will come true."
3,been there,"Jemima J is a novel about a 'fat girl' unhappy with her life and the fun times that escape her. After pining for her co-worker Ben, and having a love/hate relationship with coworker Geraldine, she decides to have some fun on the internet. Finally, a place she can be anyone she wishes. In fact, she's already lost 10 lbs just by surfing and not snacking. She meets a handsome guy from LA, and that's when she decides to change her life. Having been 190 lbs myself, and dieting down to 130, i know it's possible. The weightloss becomes your obsession. The story follows Jemima's newfound social life, but we note she is still the unsure 'fat girl' inside at times. The author projects this aspect well, and we all have a 'hint' of Jemima in us. This is certainly not heavy reading, but it's a fun beach read that keeps your attention."
2,Not So Great,"I was so excited to read this book, as it seemed like something I could relate to and enjoy. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Yes, I finished the book (record time = EASY reading), but I was frustrated with it all the way through. The switch from first to third person storytelling was annoying, and the writing seemed either condescending or ... does the author really think we are idiots? I guess she chose this style intentionally, but - why? Plus, I think it sends a bad message about women, men, image... believe me, I like Cinderella stories as much as the next person (probably more), but this just didn't work for me."
1,Complete and utter waste of time,"What a disappointment. The story starts out nice, but turns into a complete farce. From 200 plus pounds to 120 in 3 months?? Give me a freaking break. And not only does the heroine drop weight in the blink of an eye, she's **gasp** the most beautiful person in the world and **gasp** every single man who meets her must have her. Whatever. Thin people should do a little bit more research before they decide to write a ""fat girl"" book. There's just too many of us who are going through it to buy into this ... .Do youself a favor and read ""Getting over it"" or ""Good in Bed"". Those are worth the time."
1,Do not take this book lightly....throw with great force,"Obviously this book was written by someone who has never been overweight in her life. Besides being poorly written and predictable I also found it to be patronizing and ridiculous. It may come as a surprise to Jane Green but many overweight people do have friends and do go out in public. Also if Jemima is so insecure would she really be seen walking to work eating 2 bacon sandwiches? Another surprise for the author is that if you have been heavy your whole life as Jemima was and lose that much weight in that short of a time you will not look like a supermodel naked. This book was unfunny, unrealistic and at its best extremely boring. Do your self a favor and skip it."
3,Jemima J: Pure Fluff with a London Accent,"Jemima J is a very fluffy tale of an overweight Londoner journalist named Jemima, her miraculous weight loss transformation, and her search for romance and love. The novel offers quite a few contradictions and mixed messages, as well as a heavy reliance on farfetched coincidences and fate. While the book is engaging (its style reminds me of a poor man's Bridget Jones and the point of view switches from Jemima to an omniscient narrator, back to Jemima, and then to other main characters), the insistence that beauty equals goodness grates on one's nerves after awhile. But once Jemima finally achieves happiness and understands that life as a size 8 doesn't necessarily equate to perfection, the story redeems itself a bit. Jemima J is a Cinderella story, and if you can't resist a girl finding her Prince Charming, check it out of the library for a relaxed Saturday afternoon read."
2,Green believes that love and obesity are mutually exclusive,"Jemima only fulfills her dreams of love after she loses weight and gets surgery. What kind of message is that to the world? She is still the same kind, loving person as she was when she was fat, but it is only when she is beautiful as well that she gets the man of her dreams. A very disappointing read."
3,Elementary Reading,"This was what I would call Elementary Reading. The story line is not only predictable but very common... boy meets girl, girl likes boy, girl becomes beautiful, yadayada. The story line however wasn't the really the problem with the book (I often like this overused plot) the problem was the authors comments in the book. For example, we'd be reading about Jemima's day and all the sudden a short paragraph would read something like 'little did she know this would effect her life later'. I thought these little paragraphs were annoying, like we couldn't figure out on our own where the story was going or that we were too dense to understand the story line ourselves. I didn't hate the book, as I did finish it. However, I would recommend it to any intelligent reader."
3,wordy yet catchy,"This is a great reminder that Helen Fielding has company! J.J. is not as humorous as ""Bridget Jones"" but it does keep your attention. You are really rooting for Ms. Green's leading woman, but you become frustrated for the decisions she makes. The author can be less repetitive at times, but all and all it kept my attention and I read it willingly in only a few sittings. Hope you enjoy it."
3,"Likeable, shallow, compulsively readable","Yep, this book has a strange view on weight loss, at first seeming to encourage what sounds like anorexia, then doing an about face in the last chapter. But Jemima J ranks medium high on the list of all these Bridget Jones Clones out there- the way it switches back and fourth between first-person and second-person to be interesting. Same dumb girl get guy and great job ending, but fun nonetheless.Want better BJ Clones? Read Getting Over It by Anna Maxted, or hell, just read Bridget itself. Then maybe we should all move on with it...surely women can find some other subject to read about besides getting a man!"
2,Disappointing,"I expected a lot more from this book but was left disappointed. The pages went on and on without an end in sight, so I started skipping to the end just to see what would happen. The fact that Jemima lost 100 pounds in three months was so unrealistic and unhealthy. For everyone who has ever dieted, you know that's impossible. I recently purchased two other Jane Green books - Mr. Maybe and Bookends - and am hoping those don't leave me disappointed as well."
4,Better than Bridget Jones . . .,"At first glance, this book seems to be just a Bridget Jones knock-off. After all, it's about an overweight, British twenty-something who's in love with a gorgeous man on the job. (In fact, Jemima's last name is Jones!) But, there are subtle differences that make this book better. First, Jemima seems to be much more self-confident than Bridget, which is refreshing. Although she'd love to be thin, she recognizes her own attractiveness as well as her writing talents. Also, she isn't nearly as obsessive as Bridget. (No counting calories and cigarettes in this one.) What kept me from giving the book a five star rating is the fact that somehow Jemima loses 100 pounds in three months--not realistic. Also, the plot unravels very strangely towards the end. But, overall it was an entertaining read that gives a great glimpse into how society treats overweight people."
4,If You're A Sucker For Romance....,"...then this is the book for you! I definitely have to agree with ""KO""...it's a light read and written in a very unique way! I thoroughly enjoyed it! Might be unrealistic, but then again, novels are escapism anyway, right? So, just throw sense of reality to the wind and just go with this book. It was definitely not a disappointment for me!"
2,Disappointing,"I did not think the ending was at all fulfilling. I liked it until the last 75 pages or so. I was very disappointed from that point. I wish I would have just stopped reading it, I would find it more fulfilling to have not had the experience of the disappointment."
1,I can't believe this book sold even 1 copy - to me!,"Other women I know liked this book. We are no longer friends.I, in fact, was sucked in my the ""chick lit"" friendly cover, thinking I was about to read something of the caliber of Laurie Notaro or Amy Sohn. I was sorely wrong. It was awful, horrible, disgusting. The worst piece of trash I've read EVER. The only reason why I read about 60% of the stupid book is because I would toss it away in disgust, follow it up with disbelief, which led me to pick the freaking thing up again, read more, then repeat the process all over again. What I have left is a worthless, terribly battered copy of this book and an extremely bad taste in my mouth."
1,"if I could choose zero stars, I would.","Yes, it's that bad. It may actually be one of the worst books I've ever read. Not only are all the characters completely unrealistic and two-dimensional, but the ""message"" of the book is horribly vile and vapid.I was initially intrigued by the premise--a commentary about body size and social status, and of exploring the idea of online love connections. But, this book told us that if you're fat, then you will have no friends, no professional future, no love life, but if you starve yourself and lie to become what you've previously scorned (airheaded social climbers), then everything will pretty much turn out great!I really liked Bridget Jones, Good In Bed, and other books of this genre (British working girl in her thirties, having a life, being funny), but this is bad, bad, bad. Please don't waste your time or money on this trash. You'd be better off with a Harlequin romance. For real."
1,Just what the world needs....,"Something else to tell women that fat = horrible lonely person and skinny = beautiful wonderful person. Sheesh... Isn't there enough self-loathing brought on by the rest of the pop-media? Women of any weight and age don't need such a petty narrow-minded mirror to hold up to themselves. I would give it 0 stars if I could. And its not even well written, to boot... or should I say boot-cut jean?"
3,if you have a spare Sunday you may as well read this one,"I had read Mr. maybe by the same author and found it extremely pleasant so I wanted to read more stuff that she wrote. However I was really disappointed after reading the first few pages. Gives you a nice time, I did not want to put it down but I wasn't dying to finish it either. For those who haven't read any of Ms. Green's books, I'd say ""Go for Mr.Maybe""."
1,Awful!,Oh please..this book was awful. Only if you get thin will you be happy and get prince charming? It just feeds into the horrible lookist society we are in. The writing was not terrible which disappointed me even more...it could have been a better book..if she hadn't copped out. Soo depressing!
1,CurlyD,"I have never written a review before, however, after reading the reviews for Jemima J. I felt compelled to write one. I really couldn't finish reading Jemima J. I was drawn in by the simple fact that it reminded me of Bridget Jones's Diary. However, don't be fooled. Bridget, no matter how over weight wasn't as pathetic as Jemima. Bridget was easy to read and so funny, I really didn't find any humor in Jemima only self-loathing. Truly for a fun summer read skip over Jemima J. and go straight for Bridget Jones! Hurrah!"
1,"Stereotypically ""Fat""","As others have said, Green's views of the world are extremely shallow & stereotypical- from the overweight to the good-looking to Californians to bosses, every possible stereotype is thrown in here & embellished in the most petty way possible, right up to the ""twist"" (which is a pretty crummy twist, may I add). I had heard good things about this book & was excited to read it, but I was severely disappointed- this book definitely falls flat of witty & insightful. Go bridget Jones instead, PLEASE!"
1,A waste of time!!!,"I had high hopes for this book based on the reviews. However, I was very disappointed. The plot was not even decent fluff! The characters were pathetic. The message that it sent was that it is okay to be a brainless twit who's only goal in life is to get a gorgeous man at any price and to surround yourself with uncaring, egocentric ""friends"". 1 star is pushing it on the ratings. This book is definitely trash can material."
1,A very lame Bridget Jones wannabe,"I tried and tried to get through this book and was continually discouraged by the amateurish and plodding writing style. Jane Green doesn't write in a very engaging way and the narrative is dull. Jemima is a fat girl, lusts after cute boy, has thin gorgeous friends and roommates, boring career. Ugly-duckling-into-swan story, a cliche even when done well. It tries to be Bridget Jonesy and isn't half that book, which in itself is no great work. I couldn't get past 50 pages in this book even after giving it multiple tries. Don't bother."
1,Shallow book with an ok story,"This book is about life Jemima Jones, a girl whose life is miserable and she is unnoticed until she loses over 100 pounds. Then her boss starts giving her promotions and men can't keep their eyes off of her. The story is very shallow and I think an insult to overweight and thin women alike. It is written very poorly in first and then out of nowhere 3rd person comentary. I recommend this book to teenagers with nothing better to do."
4,Good Light Read,"This was the first Jane Green novel I read and I really liked it. I didn't have high expectations as I had never read one of her texts before, that being said I didn't have anything to compare it to either. I enjoyed the characters, but this does come with a warning the novel is very predictable. It is a modern 'ugly duckling' story and the story of a woman coming into her own and feeling comfortable in her own skin. Even though it was predictable it was a great read that made me giggle and gave me that overall 'fuzzy warm feeling'. I'd recommend it as a great beach read."
3,"Great Beginning, Falls apart in the end.","Jemina J. by Jane Green is a book thats starts out great. Everyone who isn't a size 2 can relate to Jemina and hard is it in a perfect size world. But, towards the end Jemina become what she hates the most. If you are intested in reading it, check it out and don't waste your money like did."
1,What a horrible book!,"Jemima J is FULL of trite writing and ridiculous stereotypes, not just regarding overweight women, but men, Californians, thin people... Honestly, how many times can an author describe a person as a ""gorgeous Californian babe""--who talks like that anyway? Jane Green's description of Internet usage was almost painful to read--yes, we get it, ""LOL"" means ""laughed out loud."" The switching from first person to omniscient third person served to pound any subtleties out of the writing; Jane Green must have thought her readers would be completely oblivious to the plot were it not for her to make everything so ridiculously obvious. The only reason I finished reading this book was that I made the mistake of paying for it and listened to the bookstore clerk's recommendation that it was like Bridget Jones. It's NOTHING like Bridget Jones, both of which books were wonderful, witty, and humorous. Save your money, or better yet, buy the Bridget Jones books instead."
1,Worst thing I've Ever Read!!!!,"How do people like this get published? I could spoil everything, alas there is not much to spoil. OF COURSE, being thin makes all your dreams come true. <<barf all over this book>>"
1,Not Even Close to Real,"I was encouraged and surprised when I found this book, to finally see a story where the heroine wasn't a model. But that was where the love affair with the book ended. It plays on one stereotype after another and not just of people, but of places and nationalities. This author is seriously out of touch with how a plus-sized woman feels and operated in the world. The heroine is pathetic, desperate and unhappy until she magically transforms herself. It is as if he life doesn't begin until she's thin. This is the fat-girl's Bridget Jones, and this version is poorly written, with characters you don't really care about, trite twists of plot line and oh so predictable. if you want to read something worth while featuring an overweight title character go buy ""Good in Bed"" by Jennifer Weiner."
2,Silly,"It would appear that the author has (a) visited Santa Monica, California, specifically the area within walking distance of the pier, and thinks someone flying to Hollywood would stay at Shutters-HELLO, there ARE hotels closer to Hollywood (b) believes one can lose nearly 100 pounds within a very few months and become nearly anorexic without losing her hair or having saggy skin, and cure her own eating disorder by falling love,(c) likes to generalize about Americans (Californians) as too friendly, dense, shallow, obsessed with body image and obviously not smart enough to be British."
2,Jemima J doesn't live up to the hype,"Entertaining? Yes. Funny? At times. Jemima J is an easy read with interesting characters and a good laugh or two. However, from all of the hype I expected to read a story of a woman who moved beyond her body obsession to a better place, both physically and mentally. What I found was a story about a woman who goes on some bizarre starvation/ninja exercise regime and voila--the man of her dreams falls into her arms. Yes, there were some cautionary lines about how she shouldn't be doing it and at the end, she chooses a more moderate path. However the underlying message was: to get your man, buy into all of the supermodel hype, lose 100 pounds plus, and Mr. Dreamboat will come to you.Highly disappointing, despite some original plot twists and turns."
4,"overall, not a bad book... BUT....","okay, i'm confused. Is Jane Green british or american? Overall, this is a fairly entertaining book, much better than ""a girl's guide to hunting and fishing (which i'd recommend against)"". However, the author swishes back and forth between british word choice and others that are decidedly american. it felt a little funny, a bit schizo at times. the book is good while it lasts. however, as soon as you finish it, you quickly forget what you've just read. not exactly memorable."
2,Dissapointing Ending,"I was totally absorbed with this book throughout until I got to the end. I wont reveal what happens, but basically everything is resolved in about a page, leaving me wanting to know more. The book just follows the formula too well, dragging us through Jemima's life, wondering how it will all turn out, only to leave me dissapointed in the end. Also, the changing voices of narration was odd and at times distracting. Also, it seemed that several threads were never really dealt with, just mentioned once or twice, leaving you to wonder. I hope this doesn't mean there will be a sequel..."
3,Looking for love in all the wrong ways and places,"Jemima J. speaks for many big, beautiful woman who feel that the need to slim and beauty to be accepted in world. And like many women, she thinks the finds love through the Internet. Thinking with her heart and not with her heart. She goes on crash course of diet and excercise in order to look like woman she has placed in Brad's mind. It is only when she goes to visit him in Los Angeles when she find out that being used a ""trophy"" when the real woman he loves looks the way she did before transition. This book does tell the story how a person should first love oneself and not worry about pleasing or wondering what other people think about them."
4,Definitely worth the read!,"This is definitely worth the read. Granted, if you're looking for something of a classic, analytical, etc. kind of read, this may not be for you. But if you're looking for something lighthearted, entertaining, and most of all, just enjoyable, by all means, this will not be a disappointment. It's humorous. It's fun. It's definitely worth the read. This story follows jemima j and all her tribulations of being overweight in the begininning. As the story goes on, she loses weight, and she starts leading a different lifestyle. Many will complain that this story is too much of a fairy tale: Overweight girl is depressed, girl loses weight, and all her dreams come true. But regardless, I do believe there is an element of truth in her outcomes. I guarantee this is a book that you will have a hard time putting it down."
2,A Disappointing Book,"A plausible and promising plot sagged before the middle and dragged on and on all the way to the end. I only finished it to see if the writer could redeem the book at last. The plot twist might have made the book terrific, but didn't quite work--it was rendered more incredible than believable and fell sadly flat. This book seems not to have seen the hand of an editor, ruthless or otherwise. There was entirely too much of it, but not enough credible detail or drama worked into it along the way to either make it work or sustain it. It demonstrated a nice flair for writing and language, but was weak on storytelling."
2,"Ugly ducklings, we are not!!","Yes, I will agree that I just could not put this book down....no matter how mad I became, I wanted to see what would happen next. But I was upset!!! If you have ever been overweight in your life, don't read this book. I could not believe that Jane Green described Jemima as grossly overweight, so much so that no one would give her the time of day. Then, in the middle of the book, Green tells us that Jemima is 5 foot 7 and 217 pounds!! Then you look at the picture of the author on the back cover and you understand everything."
1,Don't Bother With This One,"I don't put books down. But by the end of the first chapter, I was ready to toss it. I did not find this novel to have any goodness or decency in at all. Within the first few pages one discovers that the main character is overweight, has no self esteem or friends and finds solace in food. Losing weight and finding a man will not change all that. If you want to read a book about a woman to identify with, try Wally Lamb's ""She's Come Undone"", which despite being written by a man, I found for the most part more realistic and less like a thin woman writing about a subject she could not possibly (obviously, it really shows) know anything about."
1,Possibly the worst book I have ever read,"It's ridiculous and insulting. The characters are entirely one dimensional. The weightloss is ludicrously fast. If you're a heavy girl looking for a sensitive portrayal of a fat girl in love, look elsewhere."
3,Give it a try...,"I bought this book based on reviews that it was a really good read. In the beginning I just could not get into this book. I put it down and went to another book - I was reading three at one time. It wasn't until JJ lost the weight and went to LA that I became more interested and then couldn't put it down. All in all it took me four months to finish it, when normally it takes a couple of weeks to complete a book. I read another review talking about the book being written in different persons switching between first, second and third! I thought I could overlook that, but THAT was the reason I couldn't get into this book at first. So my advice it to give it a try, you just may end up not being able to put it down."
1,Awful.,"If you want to read a hilarious book about an English woman looking for love, read either of the Bridget Jones books. If you want to read a realistic and moving story of a fat girl who turns her life around, read ""She's Come Undone."" If you want to read a novel that's not funny; that's not clever or well-written; that has undeveloped, shallow characters (including the title character); that uses unnecessary and annoying shifts in point of view; and that is, overall, a complete waste of time, read this. With those expectations, you won't be disappointed."
1,Truly Bad,"Having lost 156 pounds myself, I was excited to read this book. In the first 1/3 I totally related to Jemima. At my highest weight I was 347 pounds and I was huge. I had three chins. I couldn't fit in a regular sized seat. I ate way more food than I should have. I kept feeling like YES, I know Jemima's pain! Then Green breaks the news that Jemima only weighs 217 pounds. WHAT??? Shattered. All hope for this book was shattered. At the time I read Jemima J, I weighed 210 and was wearing a size 16. I was in no way disgusting, nor did any of the discriptions of Jemima even come close to being real for a 217 pound size 16/18 woman.It made me really mad.This is not a fairy tale."
1,I'm a sucker for a book cover,"I picked up this book before I boarded a flight. I thought the cover was interesting and truth be know I had been binging a bit on the ""overweight"" genre. However after reading this book, I advise not to judge a book by its cover. It was trite, boring and down right poorly written.After reading it, I only wanted to have friends read it just to agree. I don't even want to waste time writing a review. I think I will leave it outside and hope it gets rained on."
1,It's like a handbook for eating disorders,"The only thing you need to know about this book is that pro-anorexia websites have referred to it as a motivational ""thinspiration"" book. I highly doubt Jane Green ever intended this, but I guess it's no surprise that a depressingly ludricrous weight-loss story that continuously fetishizes glossy images and ideals about thinness has managed to attract such an audience. I hated this book."
1,Slightly entertaining,"I emphasize the word ""slightly"". This book was very poorly written, and I am a bit offended that this woman can be published but many other writers who great exceed her are snubbed. The book itself is offensive in that Ben only finds her attractive after she loses weight. That may be realistic, which is unfortunate, but it shouldnt' be treated as acceptable. Also the portrayal of a ""fat chick"" as stuffing her face with bacon sandwiches and washing it down with candy bars is naive at best. The author needs to stick to the old saying of ""write what you know""."
2,entertaining but offensive,"I agree with sparklegypsy. The book is entertaining in a silly sort of way but this author (and much of the general public) obviously have a distorted view of what being abnormally overweight is. People would not ridicule or feel sorry for a size 14, 5'7"" woman. That size woman would also not need to shop in larger size stores. In fact, she would not even be wearing the largest size at most stores! As a size 14, 5'8"", 200 pound woman I found this offensive. I think many people would be very surprised if they compared what I look to their mental picture of Jemima. This author should have done more thorough research!"
1,"If you are over 12, let this one go!","I had to write, what an awful read. It is written on the level of the books you used to read in middle school. The fantasy, the coincidental, unbeleiveable, fairy tale ending all play into the pre-teen fantasy of life. Hands-down the worst part was the constant, and without warning, mid-paragraph switch from first to third person. It was no less than maddening!Read Bridget Jones, read See Jane Date, read ANYTHING else!"
1,Not my cup of tea...,"This book to me was everything a novel about a woman shouldn't be. Jemima J finds happiness through others acceptance and not her own. Throughout this book she conforms to society's ideology of what is beautiful. She loses an extreme amount of weight for a man in 3 months which is first of all unbelievable, and gets her hair dyed blond. Is this what every woman should be striving to be like because I can guarantee it won't happen. This book was written in a fashion to make everyone that does not weigh 120 pounds feel inadequate. Before ""JJ"" lost her weight no one even paid her any attention, but all of a sudden a few skipped meals and frequent breaks to exercise make Jemima a beauty queen! I personally want to thank Jane Green for instilling in many of us young women that we should all be content with searching for our happiness in what others think of our appearance, not our intelligence.(Not quite)"
1,Waste of time,"As the other reviewers have said, this book has a horrible message. If you're fat, get an eating disorder, and then you'll get everything you want. First, the plot doesn't even make sense, she magically just loses all the weight, secondly the man who really loves fat women and is obsessed about being fit just to hide seems ridiculous, and third, the whole thing is just dumb. This was such a waste of time, I felt like I got dumber after reading it. It wasn't even entertaining as much as it was frustrating."
2,OK,"This was an ok book. I think it was pretty stereotypical. I am 5'4"" and 157 lbs., but I have a love life and lots of friends. It was fun to read though. It also gives me hope that determination can get you whatever you want.I didn't like Jemima, because she isn't very kind to overweight people.Even though she is one herself, she portrays them as being constant eaters. Some people really do have problems that don't relate to over-eating and under-exercising.And ::GASP:: some people are BORN overweight, like me!It's not because you are a eating machine. Maybe in her case, but not in mine.And who says skinny is the only size to be beautiful?However, it was a fluffy novel. If you try to ignore the fat and thin people bashing(fat people are pathetic and thin people are shallow), you will enjoy it. I enjoyed quite a bit the first time, but the second time I thought it was kind of stupid."
2,This book is ridiculous,"I just wanted to echo everything that the first reviewer said about this book. Thank goodness I didn't buy it- I got it from the library at a beach resort b/c I ran out of good beach reads! This book is contridictory in almost every chapter. While it is a quick, fun read I found myself wondering if Jane Green remembered her story line from chapter to chapter. The object of Jemima's affection, Ben Williams, never even seems to give her the time of day-even when they are friends. When he sees her later, its obvious he is only drawn to her by her looks. In the end, Green makes a half hearted attempt in the epilogue to say that Jemima realizes that being emaciated is not all its cracked up to be, however, I wonder how long Williams will stay with her?"
5,Inspiring!!,"I loved this book. If you loved Bridget Jones, Confessions of a Shopaholic, etc., than you will love this book, especially if you have a few lbs. to shed as well. I do not think this book is at all ditzy or shallow, and anyone who says it is obviously has never known what it is like to be overweight. Jane Green gives a perfect perspective on what it's like to be really heavy, and yes, although she only gets her man once she sheds the (many) pounds, that too is quite true to life and the reader appreciated that. When you finish this amazing book, you will feel so bubbly and happy. You feel like you too can now accomplish something--Go For It!!"
1,not a very well-written one,"Anyone hoping that Green's Jemima will rival Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones will be very much disappointed. Fielding can write. Green can't. She's not funny, not suspenseful, not believable. Thank heavens I merely borrowed this clunker from the library rather than buying it. Nice cover art, though."
1,Save your money.,"Really horrible writing style. This alone, kills off any enjoyment of the book at all. Couldn't bring myself to finish it and regretted wasting my $. Plot is predictable and boring."
1,Oh PUHLEEEEESE!!!! Hands down the worst book I've ever read!,"First of all...100 pounds in like three months?!?!? Secondly, as someone who has lost a lot of weight in the past, I just could not get over the blatant inconsistancies with regard to Jemima's weight loss -- are we supposed to actually believe that after losing 100 pounds in 3 months she's left with taut skin??? Nobody will notice you've lost 100 pounds until you go out and buy new clothes and then all of a sudden you're stopping traffic -- I seriously doubt a girl could go from plus size all the way down to a size 6 without buying anything in between!I thought that this book was just absolutely stupid and the plot twist towards the end and the ending just make it seem as though the author got tired of writing. I would not have finished Jemima J had it not been for the fact that I couldn't believe it would get worse...and then it did, so I had to keep reading to see how dumb the ending would be...and I wasn't let down."
4,Lighten Up,"""Jemima J"" is the kind of book you can't put down. It's a quick read that features a Cinderella/ Ugly Duckling theme. I think that anyone who can identify with overcoming feelings of inadequacy would adore this book. The plot line did become a bit redundant but I still believe that ""Jemima J"" is a fun and entertaining book that's definitely worth reading."
1,Bleeck!,"It wouldn't let me give NO STARS!Ugh! The worst book I've ever read! What a waste of time. I agree with the previous reviewer who thought it sounded like she was a shut-in playing with Barbie dolls!I recommend it, however, as inspiration if you want to be published...if Jane Green can...YOU CAN TOO!!!i want my money back!"
5,"CAPTIVATING,ENTERTAINING READ","WHAT A CLEVERLY WRITTEN BOOK. NOT ONLY IS IT A FUN READ YET ALSO VERY TOUCHING. MOST READERS WILL IMMEDIATLEY RELATE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER TO THE MAIN CHARACHTER, JEMEIMA JONES. WRITTEN WITH TRUE EMOTION AND EMPATHY. WITH EACH PAGE READ YOU WILL BEGIN TO FEEL AS IF JEMIMA J. IS A PERSONAL FRIEND OF YOURS. PERHAPS EVEN A BEST FRIEND. THIS BOOK WILL BE ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE SUMMER READS. ENJOY!"
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING, DID I MENTION AMAZING.THIS BOOK WILL WANT TO MAKE YOU FALL IN LOVE"
5,LOVED IT... LOVED IT... LOVED IT!!!!,"This was the first book of Jane Green that I had read. From the moment I read the book, I could not put it down. I just loved the plot, and how enticing it was! Actually, in the span of 3 weeks, I read all of Jane Green's books, and I have loved everyone of them. But this one is the best. Jemima J is funny, inspiring, captivating, and just leaves you in awe! There were those jaw dropper moments that made you say ""No way! This can't be happening."" I really loved this book, and would recommend it to anyone who loves women's fiction with a twist of love."
1,"Since starting, but the ending of the book was completely horrendous.","I read the first half of this book and I though it was quite decent for its genre... but the moment I reached 3/4th of the book, I couldn't wait for it to end. The second half was traumatic to say the least... the ending made me immediately think that this book was a complete waste of time!!!"
3,Jemima J by Jane Green,"Jemima J starts with the line ""God, I wish I were thin."" Well, that grabbed me. Hmmm, don't most women mutter this exact statement multiple times over the course of their lives? But sadly, Jemima spends too much time in a pity party. I found myself wanting slap her into realizing her beauty and talent and get over her weight issues. Now, it sounds like I didn't like the book. I did like it. It was an easy read, I liked the way the author jumped between first and third person narration, and I had fun with the time period of the first foray into the internet. But read this book with the expectation of a fun, beach read and not with the intent to take away ongoing life lessons."
1,Sorry Disappointment,How sad I felt beginning the reading of this book. What an opportunity Jane Green missed in dealing with this very important subject of BODY IMAGE issues. She convoluted the real story by adding what I think surely must be a fantasy of her own related to internet porn and foul language. I was intending to use this in a very meaningful discussion on eating disorders but was so disappointed in the beginning that I abandoned the book. Too bad for Jane Green.
2,I was robbed!,I picked this book up on a whim looking for a distraction from a long plane ride. The first few chapters flew by but then came to a startling halt halfway through the plot line. I am not going to give away the story but lets just say save your five bucks and put it towards a cup of coffee or something of more enjoyment. It was a complete waste of time.
3,"Cute, but...","I picked up this book for a little bit of light reading, and because it received so many good reviews. I thought that the book was cute, if not a little predictable. Also, I was a bit bothered by the whole ""Ugly Duckling to Swan"" aspect of it. All she did was lose some weight! I found it very shallow that the weight issue played such a huge (and exaggerated) role in this book. I knew ahead of time that the story was about an overweight woman and her revelations about herself, but after finishing the book, I saw no earth shattering revelations. Te basic theme here is that if you're slim, things turn out better for you, and people who never realized you existed before suddenly fall at your feet. A cute story overall, but shallow and unrealistic."
2,Predictable and disappointing...,"I had very high expectations for this book, based on the review and recommendation from Comso. But it was so disappointing. In this age of women finding power within, this book basically devalued it all - basic story - fat girl, no friends or men, the lust/love of her life considers her only a ""work friend"". Loses 100 pounds and becomes thin and beautiful, and has all men flocking to her, including the man who previously never gave her a second thought. The whole story focused on external beauty and how ""beautiful people"" get everything in life. There was probably a subtheme of finding power within once you realize you're already beautiful on the outside, but it was very hidden, and certainly won't be found by the women likely to read this - those looking for validation to lose weight and possibly develop eating disorders, thinking it will solve all of life's problems."
1,Shallow....,"I was excited to get started on this book, and even more excited to finish it. The writing proved to be shallow and the editing errors got boring to count. The story somehow contradicts itself by seemingly holding the view that weight and looks shouldn't be the basis of how we judge one another, but surprise surprise, Jemima J. only finds herself and her happiness (not to mention boyfriends) when she loses her excess weight. There are a few token comments about how having confidence in yourself is the most important, but they seem out of place to the real message of this book- lose weight and you will be happy. Shallow, insincere, and quite frankly, juvenile."
2,"""Jemima J"" needs a warning label","Jemima J can be an enjoyably light Sunday afternoon read for adults, but I would not recommend this book to impressionable teens. The story line is a fantasy that younger readers may not be able to discern from reality. Developing an eating disorder does not make your dreams come true. It is infecting yourself with a debilitating disease, and no guy is worth that. Writing a nonchalant book about unhealthy weight loss does not seem to be responsible writing, especially for an author who claims the book is a true lesson in life. And finally, the message this book sends about finding confidence through changing yourself to conform to society's representation of beauty is degrading to women. I do not suggest reading this book for an uplifting or empowering message."
1,Ridiculous,"What can I say about Jemima J? The story was unbelievable, the characters were unrealistic, and it was just generally unlikeable. It is rife with stereotypes about larger women and sends the message that you can be a great person, but you have to be skinny to really be seen and appreciated. It is insulting to Americans (the only real friend she makes in LA is from England like her) and makes Jemima's anorexia seem healthy (where were the side effects of her seriously unhealthy lifestyle???). The author tries to tie in the ""self-love"" theme at the end by saying Jemima regained some weight (insulting her in the process by saying she's not skinny), but ultimately the book is too far gone to be redeemed at that point."
4,pretty good read,"I liked this book. So what if it wasn't so realistic as others have said, it's FICTION! that being said, i don't think it was ridiculously unrealistic, although it wasn't the most incredible read, i did enjoy reading this book. Although I'm not 100+ pounds overweight I can still relate to Jemima's insecurities; I suspect everyone has some Jemima in them. I thought the characters were well developed, I felt like I knew Jemima, Ben, and Geraldine. This was my first Jane Green novel and I will be checking out her other books. Although it was a tad predictable and a little cliche, overall i thought it was a good, light read!"
2,"A No-brainer, and not in the good way","Feh. I can say that the only thing that I liked about this book was the eye-catching cover. Not only did I find the story to be forced and unbelievable, but it managed to be condesending to overweight women like the book's heroine. The characters were equally as shallow. It's a bad sign when the author puts the most effort into providing details of a character's hair, clothing, and body size.I loved Bridget Jones, but I loved it for being light, funny, and original. This book came in 0 for 3 on that count and screamed rip-off the whole time.I have to admit that this book wasn't so bad to cause me to abandon it midway through, as I often do. Maybe there was something compelling about the story. Or maybe I just had chores to do that day so reading seemed like a better idea. A good choice if you really want to avoid laundry and there is nothing on t.v."
3,Quick fun read,"It's not the best book written of all time, or even chick lit. It's similar to Brideget Jones but not as good. It's a fun light read if that's what you're looking for."
4,good story,"I like the characters, the story was good i love Jemima you are rooting for her from the begining to get the guy, good summer read"
4,Realistic depiction,"I first read this book back in 2000 and re read it in 2012, probably several times in between.I hadnt looked at any reviews until now. I am surprised that the first three reviews were critical of Jane Green- describing a woman over 200lbs as not overweight??I am around this same weight point. I can vouch that being this size and height is regarded as overweight and almost invisible. I wondered if the female reviewers were perhaps worried that it mirrored their own situations and they hadnt regarded themselves in this light?This was a very good read. I cant believe it hasnt made it into celluloid yet?"
1,APPALLING price -- greedy,"I love this tea. I am disgusted by the appalling mark-up this seller has put on it. A one pound bag of this very same Mighty Leaf Organic Earl Grey, loose leaf, is available directly on their Mighty Leaf website for $24. I love shopping through Amazon; it is simple, and I (generally) feel secure that I'm getting competitive pricing from an array of reputable dealers. I often don't bother comparing to outside sources... in this case I'm glad I did!"
4,good solid performer,"Very good player, the only complaint, which applies to all models I'm familiar with, is the difficulty in reading the functions"
1,Cheap!!!,I was never satisfied with this player--from the moment I hooked it up to the moment it crapped out less than a year after I paid for it. With electronic items I've discovered over the years that you get what you pay for. This is the last time I try to save a little money!!!
5,Sony Multiple CD Player,"A very well build multifunction CD player from a well known nake. Proved to be an excellent replacement for my Kenwood player that died. Has multiple play select functions. Uses 5 disc turntable instead of stack cartridge for CD's. Though iit is a little noisy chen changing discs that should not detract from its compace design, durability and excellent functionality. One small drawback is that it does not have a headphone jack as the Kenwood had, but since I play through my preamp system, which has a jack this is not a major problem. All in all a very nice unit for a great price. Shipped in manufacturers packaging. Arrived in excellent condition. A definite good buy.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029U13A/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,Review of Sony SCD-CE595 5-Disc player,"The clarity of sound is exceptional in this player. It has been somewhat difficult for us old fogies to learn to load the different discs, but no doubt those technically facile would have no trouble with this."
4,Sound not as rich as I would like.,"It's nice but the sound isn't rich as I would like. I have another Sony Cd player and the sound is richer and smoother. But for the price, it's nice!"
1,Returned and Never Used,The CD player did not work and I had to return it. Amazon was very efficient with the return. I ended up buying an Onkyo CD player which works great.
1,The product does not work consistently,"I was about to email you to see how I could send this back. The unit I purchased does not work correctly. It stops in the middle of a song. It sometime starts half way though a song. It does not shuffle correctly, maybe three out of the five cd's. It could just be the unit I purchased or have you found similar problems? Please let me know how to send this defective unit back.Thank you,Jerry"
3,"Inconsitent Playback, Shallow Sound, Good Value","This is not a bad CD player, but it has some specific drawbacks. In its favor, however, the sound has good balance, with fairly clear highs. Sound, however, is noticably shallow. If you listen to a lot of music in mono or don't usually sit in a single place to listen to music, this won't be much of an issue. The only real functional problems are the slow speed of changing cds and somewhat poor performance with damaged cds. Still, this is a very inexpensive player for the quality."
4,Impressed so far with Sony..,"I rated this the Sony SCD-CE595 4 stars because I haven't had it long enough to give it the 5th one..maybe later. After putting it though its paces in the few days since I've recieved this unit, I must say I am impressed. I would have to be enthused as some of the 5 star reviewers..there have already been some things brought up such as the unit at first seems to be a little hot on the high end, I am going to wait as two other reviewers have recommended to see if does indeed tone down a little. But other wise, so far so good.After looking at Harman Kardon and Denon (I have a Denon DRA-685 receiver), I went with the Sony after reading many unsatisfied users of those products..which somewhat suprised and saddened my really, I was leaning towards the Denon 380 CD player. The Sony has won me over."
2,Didn't work,"This unit came a day late with Prime Shipping, but didn't work. It hooked up easily - it is large, 17"" deep when cables are plugged in - and played nicely at first. Sounded great, actually. But after 30 seconds or so, the disk would stop completely. I went to the next disk, same problem, again and again. And these were store bought, new CDs. So, shipped it back to Amazon for a refund and bought a Yamaha player."
4,Cd Player Review,"The cd player works well, just wish the random play would work for all of the cd's instead of only one."
2,Not for audiophiles,"Audiophiles beware. This CD player will disappoint you if you are used to high quality sound. I had an old Philips CD player that finally gave up the ghost and I replaced it with this machine and the decrease in sound quality was immediately noticeable. Sony used to be a top-flight brand in audio equipment. Apparently, not anymore. The other problem with this machine is it won't play a lot of my homemade CDs. I have a variety of other players, Pioneer, NAD, even boomboxes, that all have no problem with the homemade CDs. Come on, Sony. You can do better than this."
3,No MP3 support,"A nice unit, but had to return it when we discovered that it doesn't play MP3's. This information, which is rather basic, wasn't made clear as we were reading the specs. We got the information from Crutchfield and confirmed it on opening the manual. Went to an Onkyo and it plays everything..."
4,Good Overview of Mark Twains Life.,I enjoyed this book because I found out a great deal of important information about Mark Twain in a way that was easy to read and understand. I think this book is great at getting children interested in this famous author. I enjoyed the pictures as they showed the images of that time period. I also liked that there were maps and background information about historical events during Mark Twains life.
5,Granddaughter enjoyed reading about Mark Twain's life.,"I bought this book for my 8-year-old granddaughter because she had been reading some of Mark Twain's stories which had been edited for younger readers, and my daughter told me that she was really enjoying them. Here is her review of ""Who Was Mark Twain?"".Dear Grandma,I really loved the book about Mark Twain. It was kind of sad towards the end, but that kind of gave the moral to the story. In the old times, people got very sick. I liked the beginning especially, because it told about when Mark Twain was a boy. I learned about Halley's Comet. It was fun and interesting. His stories were based on his own life. So now you can see that I liked it a lot!!Thank you for giving me this book. It was great!Love,Laurel"
4,Eye Catching and Easy to read book!,This book has excellent content about Mark Twain with an interesting twist of illustrations to keep the reader interested! The text is large and easy to read! Kids will love reading about the interesting life of Mark Twain!!
1,Qualitee International Master Cylinder,"I purchased this cylinder as it was approved to fit a 1972 BMW. I received the productfrom Fruit Ridge Tools, and it fit with no problems. Being an old car I did not have the hose or the connections to fit on the cylinder. No problem! I'll go to my local auto parts store.It has been three weeks and I have been to Auto Parts, Auto Zone, Napa, Home Depot, numerous auto dealers. I have spent hours onthe web to BMW parts dealers, JC Whitney, BMW used part dealers and numerous auto sales sites. I did find the connection at BMW Buddy. but there is a selection of 20 or more I have no idea which one. I emailed the info but thus far no response. ebay has a few but no measurements, I could find no email address for Qualitee and Fruit Ridge Tools couldn't help. I am going toa local machine shop to see if I can have some type of adapters made. I paid 119.00 for a cylinder that the seller has no connections for."
1,Don't bother to buy this one!,"What a disappointment. The unit arrived in a box that practically fell apart. The power cord was hanging on the outside of the box. I didn't even have to open anything, the bottom just fell right out. The front panel of the unit was cracked. The top left corner was dented. It doesn't even work. I plugged the unit in, pushed the on & off button; nothing happened. A non-functional dehumidifier. In addition, the bottom of the box looks like it has been cut open and sealed back up. Don' waste your time or money!"
5,NICE PRODUCT !,"LOVE THE BOOK, VERY CHEAP AND A GREAT PRICE ! LOVE IT , HOPE MORE PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON !"
1,"Bad Design, bad content","This book really disappointed me, I have found it full of mistakes and incorrect information. The cover looks attractive, but that's all, don't expect any more of it. I have read all the guide books about Turkey, and need a good one go for Blue Guide, Fodor's, Michelin, Bedeakers'."
4,Easy and smooth read,This book is an easy read and takes you from Alpha to Omega of ASP.NET in smooth flow. This is also very thorough with illustrations.
2,Not useful,"This book is like those instruction you will want to give to your team members if you are the leader, but having to keep reading that for close to 600 pages!Yes, the target is clearly not defined and if you want to get a work done by reading this book, please forget it.If you implemented membership and roles, and seeking some extra advice may be you might find it useful. It does not really explain the various systems, illustrating each well enough.I opened Forms Authetication, hoping to learn how to implement it in my project, just to read more than a page of people creating 50 years cookie. Is 2 or 3 lines of sentenses not enough to let someone know about 50 years cookie?"
3,Way Over-Priced!,"Whiile tthe product itself is very good and does the job, the brushes are WAY Over-Priced.How many many toothbrushes could you buy for the same price? Mucho many!"
4,Do the job,"Basically thick pantyhose with a very slight shimmer that do a great job of covering up scars. I have very discolored knees and you couldn't tell in these. I did manage to put a tiny hole in the foot somehow so they're not bulletproof, but they didn't end up running. Works for me! :-)"
5,LOVE THESE AND ALL THE COLORS THEY COME IT....,"I LOVE THESE TIGHTS AND WILL BE BACK TO GET MORE THEY FIT GREAT AND I NORMALLY CANNOT FIND TIGHTS TO FIT ME, THANKS FOR HAVING GREAT TIGHTS AND THEM FITTING GIRLS WITH BIGGER BOTTOMS!!!!"
3,"Good introduction, but not for me.","This is a great introduction to the entire conversion process however, the author was coming completely from a Reform inter-faith couple standpoint. I am 19yrs old and approaching Conservative Judaism on my own so this wasn't exactly what I was looking for."
3,not what I was looking for,As a person choosing Judaism solely out of spiritual and religious conviction I didn't feel my needs were met. This book seems like it is an incredibly valuable tool to those who are part of an interfaith couple but not so valuable to those who are doing this alone.One thing I found in this book that I have not found in many other books on converting to Judaism is information on children. As a single mother i am searching everywhere on info on how to best introduce Judaism to my daughter and how she can be included on this journey of mine. I am grateful about the inclusion of that subject in Mrs. Diamant's book but again it was geared towards interfaith families never single ones.
4,Choices not made lightly,"I picked up this book as an effort to further my ponderings on Judaism, and was not disapointed. Diamant has created a user friendly, practical and heartfelt guide to Conversion that is filled with useful information, tips, telephone numbers, suggested reading material, and all the other goodies including sample prayers, poems, gift suggestions and advice.Diamant does an excelent job of conveying the seriousness of the choice to Convert, and explains in plain language what some of the problems you'll face as a convert are. ""The December Dilemma"", cool responses from born-Jews, telling your family about your decision to convert, and more.If this book has one flaw it is that its focus is very narrow, focusing on the nuts and bolts of conversion only and not covering ideas and processes for practicing a Jewish life which is entwined with the conversion experience.All in all a hearty recomendation.--AM"
3,Good for the right audience,"Choosing a Jewish Life is easy to read and contains a lot of good information for people convering to Judaism. It is geared toward people approaching marriage to Jews, but not exclusively."
3,Limited,"There is a principle that 'all of Israel was given one Torah'. Meaning that as much as we all have our own individual place within Judaism, the teaching Judaism is essentially unified. This seems to be lacking in this book. Granted that the author is ideologically aligned with 'Liberal Judaism', the book seemed to be limited to this, and was not able to trancend denominational constructs and get at the deeper Judaism which is relevant to us all.Conversion to Judaism is the culmination of a deep search for roots, linking one to a continuous 4000 year old chain of shared tradition. Instead the book gave details of conversion to a modern American cultural club. Those on a true spiritual journey will hopefully be able to see further than this."
5,I know I was led to this Book!,"What a wonderful, truly spiritual book for someone beginning the conversion process to Judaism. Anita Diamant's words are soft, but powerful, simple yet informative. She really has a way of touching a heart and calms a person's fears, who is considering conversion. I crave more knowledge of Judaism because of this book. Anita includes poetry, Jewish terminology, jokes, explanation of rituals all in one book, that I believe was a beautiful gift to me from above."
4,Far better than a hole in a table,"I've been using a table mounted router for years, but this is the first router plate I've used. Overall, it is a great addition to my shop. I can easily lift the router out of the table to change bits and the two removable concentric rings adjust the opening for various sizes up to about a 3 1/2"" opening for raised panel bits. The shortcomings are minor. The Allen screws for leveling the plate vibrate out of adjustment easily. I think a little Teflon tape or the right kind of Locktite will solve that problem. The concentric rings snap into the plate, but they are not snug and vibrate a little. I sometimes have to be sure I set the work piece down on the edge of the outer ring before running the piece through the bit. Not a real problem though. The plate was half the price of some that I found on line. (Since purchasing this plate, I found that Harbor Freight sells what appears to be the same product for somewhat less cost.)"
1,Dont waste your money/time!,"I purchased this plate from another company HF (Not Amazon). I have had it in use for about two years and about a year ago the edges began to spring up a bit in the corners causing a very big problem with stock bumping while routing. Needless to say the ""bump"" would transfere to the piece and ruin it! I have dealt with this off and on since then (I dont use my router table as often as I could/should) I am now buying an aluminum plate to replace it and wish I had never wasted money/time on the HF unit. I hope this review cause those shoppers out there to pass on this unit and in fact pass on all phenolic plates and go to the metal ones for long term satisfaction."
1,plate not flat,"I've used a few router table insert plates. The JessEm Rout-R-Plate is the one I've had for the past five years. I recently decided to add another router table to my shop, and thought I'd try the MLCS plate. I've ordered a LOT of router bits from MLCS, and have never had a problem. This plate, however, is a piece of junk. After five years of having a Bosch 2 1/4 horsepower router hanging under the JessEm there is zero warp to the plate (I just checked... it is dead flat.) The MLCS came out of the packaging with warp in two directions. It warps downward in the long dimension, and upward in the short dimension. The mounting instructions spec. that there is intentional ""crown"" to counteract the downward force of the router hanging below. Why? A good plate should not flex, and what do you do until gravity corrects the crown? Also, the removable rings snap in with friction fit - no locking action. That's asking for frustration if not an accident."
3,No Markings,"I ended up returing this and getting the Rousseau plate. This one does not have inch markings on either side of the center hole, which makes it difficult to position the fence. Other than that it is the similar to the Rousseau plate."
3,paid too much,the item seems to be working just fine; but 2 days after i received it MCLS was closing the item out for $12 less.that is about 1/3 of the retail price.
2,Approximate Size Doesn't Cut It,"The product description says it is ""approximately 9 x 12 inches"". That may be fine for someone who will cut a hole in their router table for the insert, but for those who already have a router table, the exact measurements are needed. Pretty much the standard for inserts is 9-1/4-Inch by 11-3/4-Inch. I would buy one of these if I knew for sure the exact size."
5,THE BEST IVE EVER SEEN.,"THIS BY FAR IS THE BEST MUSIC VIDEO I HAVE EVER SEEN.I HAVE NEW HOPE FOR THE WORLD JUST KNOWING SOMEONE OUT THERE CAN CREATE SUCH WONDERFUL IMAGES,VERY SIMULAR TO THE IMAGES I HAVE IN MY HEAD.IT MADE ME WANT TO RIP MY FACE OF."
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this book, but was immediately surprised at two things when it arrived: 1) the format is larger than I'd hoped for. 2) It's black and white, with a section of color photos in the center that are often vague about locations.I've been to 2 of the locations that were listed, and yes, the details are accurate. However, I was hoping for more: what to do in the area for day trips, and color photos of each park for example. Those was lacking."
5,Hell yeah Rosie!!! Great personal journey on the road across forever...,Rosie ~ Thanks for a great book from one woman to another. This book NEVER gets boring. Now I only have to thank my dad for lending it to me!!
3,Hmph. 'Twas OK.,"Well, here we are, a half-vampire readying himself to show himself to the vampire clan. The trials certainly seem awful, but for reasons unknown to me, they just didn't...seem right? I dunno. Lately, however, Darren seems to be lacking. He's not exactly beinga strong character to me. And he's awesomely lucky. Trouble is, I knew what was going to happen...sort of. The Blooded Boars, I was NOT expecting. I loved Darren Shan's works, until these last two books. Oh, Darren, please shape up!"
5,Trials of Death,This book is a wounderfull and stuning tale that leaves you hungry for more. You'll be on everyday lookin for the next one
3,just read it,"Trials of DeathThis is about a kid named Darren Shan who must under go five tests or trials to prove himself a member of the Vampire clan. This is the 5th book in the saga.In the first part of the book he is about to go into the trial to compete in the Trials of Death. He goes though a lot of pain through the trials and makes it to the next trial after the fourth but something happens. He goes though a water game, a strength game and three other games and than he meets the Vampire Prince.It is an ok book, but I was looking for something different in this book like something didn't expect. But it's pretty good."
5,Very Good Book,"This is the type of book where the author makes the chapters pretty short so when it is very late and you think you should go to bed but you look to see how long the next chapter is and it is short, so you have to keep reading. Every single chapter has something fun to read in it. This book has a bunch of heart pounding parts. It will make you feel like you are Darren Shan and all the characters in the book. It is a book that I very recomand to everyone."
4,Fast-paced,"In the fifth chapter in the series, Darren must pass five dangerous trials to prove himself to the Vampire Princes and Vampire Generals or face death by the stakes in the Hall of Death.Darren passes the first three trials, but not the fourth. Harkat interfered and saved Darren from a wild boar. This broke the Vampire Clan's rules. The Vampire Princes and Generals began to discuss where or not Darren should continued or be put to death.Trials of Death is more fast-paced than the previous book and ends in a great cliffhanger."
5,Cirque Du Freak - Trials Of Death (Book 5),"Great book. This has the most action out of the first 5 books in the series. In Trials Of Death, Darren is really tested physically and mentally by the vampire clan. He has to undergo Trials, that will test him mainly physically, but also mentally. Has to fight through water, fire, sharp objects and so on but i'll let you read about that.This is the best book out of the first 5, because there are big turns of events in the middle to end of the book. At the end, Darren thinks he might be doomed, but is he? When you reach the end of this book, your gonna want to read book 6 directly after to find out what happens. Get this!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I couldn't have been more disappointed in this book. I am huge Baldacci, Meltzer, Green fan as well as a football nut, and I thought this would be a great read (similar to Tim Green's football novels). These stories are so bad, and paint football players in the worst light. Some of this is borderline racist in the way that these authors (Lupica, especially) try to write in the first person as ""gangsta"" football players. The editor needs to learn how to proofread, and also needs to make sure that the author information is accurate. If you are football fan and you love these authors, do not be fooled."
3,Who proofed this book???,"Baladacci's story was very good, although I don't think it is one of the ""more remarkable stories ever written"". About half of the other stories were good, the other half--terrible. What I cannot understand is how this book made it to published form with all of the errors and misprints. There are periods in the middle of words and sentences, words printed twice, mispelled words...and not just a few. There are many mistakes. It made reading a mediocre book much more difficult."
2,Parallel Universe?,"I bought this because of the blurbs on the jacket (from Publisher's Weekly and a host of celebs.) Since all of them pertained to the title story, it seems only fair to rate the book on that basis, even though the other stories vary from passable to, actually, quite enjoyable. But that first (title) story is, well, it's abysmal! The plot is inane! The dialogue resembles nothing spoken by living human beings anywhere on the planet! The prose is so many shades darker than purple that no sprectrometer could calculate it! And even the editing reflects all this. No less than three times is the word ""though"" rendered as ""thought"", several ""the""'s become ""he"" and one assumes the printer ran out of ""w"" so left ""was"" as ""as"".In short, this is either one of the most egregious examples of prose by a so-called professional I've ever seen, or I'm living in a parallel universe wherin the matters of style, substance, and grammar are reversed."
1,Pass,"This must be the summer of the spaced out best selling author. First there was ""The Beach House"", James Patterson's preposterous tale of vigilante justice against a super rich sleaze-ball. Then we get Baldacci's even more absurd story about brainy college jock Tor North looking in a maze of tunnels beneath the college stadium for a legendary running back who disappeared 40 years before. The premise, the investigtion and particularly the conclusion are ..., sorry I'm lost for the adjective that expresses the inanity of this story.Two follow on short stories, one a morality play about a murder and a soccer game that took place at the outset of WWI and the second by Brad Meltzer that draws on the classic MIT pranks at Harvard-Yale games, were actually pretty good. WARNING! The unabridged audiobook captures every word of Baldacci's ridiculous novella but omits the stories by the likes of Lehane and Lupica that I gather were part of the book. Don't expect them if you try the audio version."
2,Nothing after The Mighty Johns,"I was terribly disappointed in the short stories accompanying David Baldacci's novelette. The other short stories I took the time to read centered on crimes committed by a football loser. For me, that is not the caliber that I expect associated with David Baldacci's name. I threw the book away after 3 or 4 of those trashy stories. I will never buy another book written in this manner. The only reason I gave it two stars was because, as always, Baldacci captivates his audience, and writes so engagingly it's hard to put the story down."
2,Embarrassment,"Wow. Some of the stories in this book were really bad. The title story by David Baldacci is absolutely awful. I mean, it's John Farris-bad. Terrible pacing, dialogue, characterization, everything. Lawrence Block's story is the worst thing I've ever read by him. Gary Phillips' story is incomprehensible--I still don't know what happened.Is there anything worth reading in this volume? Yes. Brendan DuBois, Tim Green, Colin Harrison, Brad Meltzer, Peter Robinson, and John Westermann all turn in nice efforts.Unfortunately, this book was apparently never copy edited or proof read. I've never seen so many typos in a published book in my life. Embarrassing."
5,"Great, easy, enjoyable!",I felt compelled to read my wife many passages. This joins my list of favorites. I was suprised to find this book so interesting. This is a must read for anybody who wants to know the man. The book ends before Ike enters the presedential campaign.
5,The General speaks,"I have read quite a few books on Eisenhower. This one he wrote late in life. Skip the early childhood chapters and go to his time in the army and later life. He talks his mind and addresses issues, like ""favoritism"" and ""who you know"" when he was promoted. He has a lot of good advice on how to live life.I enjoyed it more than ""Crusade in Europe"", that was more historically specific but without his personal insight that ""At Ease"" has."
3,Interesting,I was drawn to this book because he was President during the most peaceful & prosperous time most Americans ever knew. As he isn't considered an 'exciting' President the book was better than I expected.
5,Additonal Insight,"This adds to understanding of who Ike was. There are insights to Ike not found in other books. Such things as his experiences growing up in Abilene, withdrawing his application for flight training to marry Mamie and his relationship with his horse in Panama. A nice rounding out of Ike's life."
3,James and The Giant Peach review,"James and The Giant Peach is a great book for everyone. I first read the book when I was about seven, and the story was so amazing that I was imediatly captivated. The story is about a child named James whos parents die one night so he is forced to live with his two aunts, but his aunts are mean and treat him badly.In an attempt to escape the terrible aunts he embarks on a journey in a giant peach, hence the title name.Inside of the peach he meets a group of insects who quickly become his friends and then becomming like a family to him. This is annother one of those books that increases the imaginational skills in young people. This is a great book."
4,James and the Giant Peach,"Imagine you are on a giant peach surrounded by big talking bugs. I think James and the Giant Peach is a good book. When James was a little boy, his parents died. Now he lives with his mean aunts."
5,The greates book,"This book by Ronald Dahl was the best and the most enjoyable. The book was a adventures. I really enjoyed the book because it was so discriptive. I would recomend this book to any body likes to read and enjoys good adventure books.I really enjoyed this book because it had very good vocabulary. I learned new words and it was fun to read this book. Another reason I liked this book is because the author lets you think that you are in the book and that you are friends with the main character. Lastly I think that this book is good is that it makes you think what is going to happen next and it gives you foreshadowing so you can think even more.This book is really good and if you want to read it your choice, but if you do have fun and enjoy it."
5,The only thing I liked about 2nd grade,"I recall my second grade teacher as being particularly cold and icey, but if there is anything that I recall from her that I liked, it was her reading of James and the Giant Peach. Her dramatics inspired me to later go into public speaking-- whenever I start getting too familiar with my material, I go and read this book, envisioning her drama. The book lends itself to dramatics and the envisioning of BIG creatures, and the story plot left us hanging on and being good so that she'd read to us the next day. I even begged my parents to take me to school for ""just 15 minutes, please?"" when I had pneumonia that year. This book kept us spellbound!"
2,Not for young children!,"The adventures of James require the gruesome deaths of his beloved parents and two awful aunts, and the acceptance of a frightening gift from a scary-looking stranger who pops out of nowhere. While the aunts are indeed terrible, their insults to James are unnecessarily cruel and prolonged. There are also an infinite number of literary ways to extract James from his predicament without killing his aunts. At one point the characters are actually gleeful about their deaths. Although the rest of the plot is imaginative, it is choppy and doesn't hang together or flow well. The ending, while happy for the characters, falls flat and carries no grand positive message. This is not a book for young children, and I don't think it is a particularly good book for any age."
2,A good fantisy book.,"I'm not really sure why I didn't enjoy this book. It had a very strange story to it; a little too strange. It did have good adventure, a fun story...I guess after reading the two Harry Potter books, nothing can compair. I reccomend this book to exadurated people."
2,James and the jiant peace~ Ronald Dahl~,"The plot of this book is for James and his friends, which are insects I might add, to go to the city of New York to be safe from James aunts.It has a good plot, but it could use a little more reason for James to for fill the plot. I mean it was his dream to go there one day, and be safe from his aunts, but it could use a little more reason. For example, It could be because it was his dream to go there and be safe from his aunts, but it could also be because it was what his parents told him to go before the rhino killed them.Over all it is a pretty good book for some, but it just doesn't fulfill my expectations. I like more of mystical books, it does have some magic, but not enough. So if to like a normal book with a little twist, please read this book."
1,"Boring, silly, annoying.","I think James and the Giant Peach is really boring to read. My type of book would be something like Put A Sock In It Percy by Judy Corbalis. Anyway, it's about a boy called James who lives happily with his parents until one night a rhinoceroes eats them up! James goes to live with his Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker, but they are greedy and so in love with themselfs. James meets a man and the old man gives him crocodile tounges! So the man tells James that they are magic and make very good things happen. James drops the crocdile tongues on a peach tree and it turns into a ginat peach with a boring adventure to add to it!"
2,Nonsense,"James and the Giant Peach is simply nonsense. If you like nonsense then you may like this book. The story is as simple as the other reviews make it sound: A giant peach grows, he crawls inside, he meets some big insects. That's basically it. It is not clever. I did not find it funny. I would have given it only one star, but my son liked it, saying, ""Dahl writes good books, but they're strange."" I feel sorry for anyone who feels this is their favorite childhood book."
4,Creative and interesting story,"The author's imagination runs wild in this fantastic story about a little boy and his insect friends. In typical Dahlian fashion, the child wins over the mean and nasty adults. The insect world inside a peach is truly fascinating."
5,James And The Jiant Peach,"A great book you should read is James and the Giant Peach. This is an adventurebook. My favorite charactor is the centipede.This book is about a boy named James Henry Trotter. One sad day, his parents are eaten by a rhino that escaped from the zoo. He has to live with his two most hated aunts, Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker. The make him their slave. One day, he sees an old man. He gives James a bag of magic bugs. He trips and they go everywhere. They go into the ground and get into the roots of the dead peach tree.The tree grows a giant peach and James goes inside a hole in it. He meets a centipede, a grasshopper, a spider, a ladybug, a glow worm, a silk worm and a earth worm. They are as big as him. They roll down the hill and squish the nasty aunts. James and his new friends meet sharks and cloud men.I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books."
3,LadyBIRD instead of LadyBUG was Weird,"I enjoyed this book as a kid, and the kids and I have seen plays on it too, but I didn't enjoy it as much this time mainly because I couldn't get past the ladybug being called a ladybird. I didn't realize until after we finished and a relative told me that they have a different name in Europe. Oh, well, I wish I had known that beforehand. Ha! This is a very strange book, and I don't recall the cloud people scene at all, but I like the notion of a little boy escaping his cruel reality."
3,lauryn review,"James and the Giant Peach is a good book for young kids and could be good for an adventure person.There are a couple main characters in this book like:James,Lady bug,,Centipede,and Grasshopper.In this book there are a couple adventures like:the peach adventure.James parents die in the begining and James is a young boy who has parents that are to very mean aunts."
4,James And The Adventure,I think that you should read the book James And The Giant peach. It's about a little boy who's auntie's Sponge and Spiker treat him badly. He finds this old man who gives him some magic. So the magic accidentally bounces off to a peach and makes it extra big. There he finds a way to get away from his auntie's. The only thing that James has is a huge peach and some insect friends that accidentally get the magic from the same old guy.Through James adventure he has a life he never had imagened.
2,It had too much name calling in it,This book was good except that the aunts and bugs were always calling James names.Once the centapied called James an ass!
3,james and the giant peach,"This book was an okay one. It was a little weird, but I liked to read it. They had a lot of unrealistic stuff in it like a peach growing at an amazing rate. There was a cloud that turned into a mean rhino and scared James. There was a flying peach because they made a balloon. This book is recommended for grades 5th to 6th."
5,James and the Giant Peach,This is a fabulous book my 4th grade teacher read to us after lunch recess. She would read us a chapter a day. Now as a mother I'm reading it to my son who is 7. He is so into it!I'm excited because his love for books and reading is growing by leaps and bounds :)
5,James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl,"This book is outstanding, adventurous, and you never know what is going to happen next!The story is about a boy, named James, who wants to be free from his awful aunts. James accidently drops the magic crystals he's been given and they sink into the soil. Amazing things begin to happen to an old peach tree as well as to creatures who turn gigantic. James and the oversized creatures ride the giant peach into many adventures. They meet sharks, seagulls and cloud men along their journey.James and his friends want to reach a safe and beautiful place to live. Will their dreams come true?We loved this book because it was funny with lots of action and adventure. We would love to read a new book, James and the Giant Peach, Part II !"
5,Wonderfull!!!!,I loved this book! I absolutly loved the part where the cloud peopole threw snow balls at them. Roald Dahl TRULY used imagination into his book. James in the Giant Peach is a little more on the serios note than other Roald Dhal books. you will love this book!!!!!!!
5,My nine-year old loved it!,"My nine-year old, who is a dedicated Roald Dahl fan, absolutely loved this book. My daughter also liked it so much that she refused to see the movie. She was afraid that the movie would ruin the story."
5,always a favorite,My 3rd grade teacher read this book out loud to my class and I have loved it ever since. A great gift for young readers.
5,Foe My Grandkids,My daughter read this in school when she was little and loved it. So when watching my grandchildren one weekend I bought it and read it to them. After they left. I finished it for myself. LOLGood book and the kids really like it. I think for the same reason that everyone loved the beginning of Harry Potter. Evil mean guardians got what they deserved. Reinforced the belief that justice will prevail. Sooner or later they will get theirs!
5,book review by a girl at cccs,This one of the best books I have ever read in my life. It is filled with adventure. My favorite character in this book is the centipede because he is extremely funny.I think you should read this book. You will definitely like it.
4,Adventurs,James drops magic beans and the peach tree starts to grow a huge peach. He finds lots of friends in it. I liked this book because the bugs come to life.
3,good,I though it was boring at the beginning. It is about a young boy name James Who lives with his Stepmothers. Now he lives in a giant peach. When they catch a lot of birds was my favorite part. I did like the ending. He lives with the bugs.
2,much too scary for preschoolers,"This crude adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic focuses on the most frightening aspects of the story. Not for young or sensitive kids. The illustrations are dark and disturbing -- even the insects who befriend James are rendered in a menacing way. It may be fine for older kids who love scary stories, but it gave my preschooler nightmares."
5,Another great book by Dahl!,"Another great book by Dahl!Fortunately, I read ""James and the Giant Peach"" before watching the movie. Give kids the same opportunity. Let them form their own mental picture without ""interference"" from having seen the film.Books can open up a whole new world to youngsters. Consider what the lives are of adults who read often as kids as compared to those who didn't. Introduce children to the joy of reading and change their future for the better!Wondering if your child would like reading, ""James and the Giant Peach?"" Wouldn't it be FUN to travel on an adventure in a humongous peach with several giant insects having human personalities?Richard W. Carlson Jr., author of ""The Feelings and Imagination of a Barefoot Boy Still Inside My Head!"""
4,This book is peachy good fun!,"Please do not judge this book by the movie of the same title! The book is fun and imaginative and just quirky enough for kids to love it. My daughter and I read it together and loved it. The only caution is that there is some language in the very first (where the wicked aunts are verbally abusing the boy) that could be offensive. Personally, I was reading aloud to my daughter and simply changed those words to something I considered appropriate. We had a great time with this book"
4,Classic amazing book with a terrible new cover,"We are reading this book- first time for my four year old and nth time for me, though I haven't read it in ages. The book doesn't require any commentary- it's as fantastical, kooky and fun as ever. My daughter is fully engrossed, which I did not imagine she would be for her age since there are aren't that many illustrations (compared to a typical kid's picture book).My only complaint is for the 50th anniversary edition, why on earth they chose to replace the beautiful original cover with this hideous comic strip type bunch of drawings. I avoided buying this even though it's hard to find another edition because it looks silly and stupid. The cover drawings don't capture anything about the book but to make it look trite. I'm baffled."
3,Humorous and Crazy,"James and the Giant PeachBy Roald DahlReview by Ms Perkins' ClassThere's a kid named James who lives with two mean greedy aunts. Their names are Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker. One day James finds the biggest peach in the world growing outside his house. He discovers a hole in the peach, climbs in and finds a door in the pit. Inside the door are ginormous insects. The grasshopper is funny and he can do a lot. The centipede is cranky and disagrees with everything. This is a fantasy about adventure. James needed some fun in his life. Roald Dahl's books are humorous and crazy. To find out about their great adventures, read James and the Giant Peach."
5,great book!!!,"I am ten years old, and this is one of the best books I ever read!! (I have read a lot of books)This story starts when James was 4 years old and happy. Then his parents get eaten by a rhinoceros on the loose. James is sent to his mean Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge. He meets a man that gives him green pebbles. Whoever touches these green objects has wonderful things happen to that object. The green things touched the roots of an old peach tree that had never had a peach. Then it grew a peach that grew bigger and bigger and bigger until it was as big as a house. He is sent outside to work, climbs into the peach and meets very big insects. They go through all types of encounters together such as escaping cloud men, and almost getting eaten by sharks. This book is very interesting and exciting. I would recommend this book to 6 to 10 year olds and I give it a 5 star rating!"
3,Book review,"Ever been in a giant flying peach? James and the giant peach by Roald Dahl tells about a boy who's parents get eaten by a giant rhino, goes to live with his evil aunts, then rolls away in a giant peach. To begin, His parents take him to the London Zoo when only to encounter a loose rhinoceros. The rhino eats James' parents to leave him on the streets. Then, he goes to live with his evil aunts, Aunt Spiker and Aunt Sponge. They treat him very badly and don't let him play with other kids. Finally, an old man comes and gives James some magic crystals. Then a giant peach grows, James crawls in the peach to find some unusually large insects. They then roll away in a giant peach in hope of finding a better place.Read this book to find out what happens to James and the giant peach"
2,James and the Giant Peach,"In my opinion, James and the Giant Peach was not the greatest book, but if you like imaginary things, you might like it. James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl describes a boy who finds a giant peach, and it rolls down a hill and ends up in the ocean; he doesnt know how to get it out. To begin, James escapes from his evil aunts house. He wanted to escape because they were mistreating him. Next, when he is in the middle of the ocean, he comes up with this interesting plan. His plan was to tie seagulls to the peach so they would lift him up. Lastly, he arrives at his destination. Aww the life of New York City. Even know I hated this book, I hope you like it."
3,Loved it as a kid,"James Henry Trotter, the loneliest boy in the world, escapes from his sad life when he encounters a giant peach inhabited by magically transformed insects. Together, they set off on a journey across the Atlantic Ocean. I remember being enchanted by this story as a child. Upon rereading it recently, however, it struck me as a somewhat cold exercise in storytelling for children. The only character that really shows any personality is the nasty Centipede, and all of them seem to be rather class-conscious--even the saintly Ladybug, who looks down on ladybugs with two dots as being ill-mannered. This is, however, still a book that I would read to my own children. My changed opinion of it probably has more to do with the evolution of my tastes as a reader than it does with the merits of the book itself."
2,james gone bad.,I am a ten years old and i have read almost all Ronald Dahl's books and loved them all but James and the giant peach was a very disliked book of mine it had bad description and I couldn't tell what was going on in some parts of the book I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone under nine or to people who don't like slow moving books.
1,What is the point?,"This iron works really well. However, the reason the we purchased cordless was to have the freedom to iron in the middle of the room without the need for an outlet. Since the iron must be placed on its base VERY frequently to remain warm, there is no real benefit to the cordless feature. We returned the product."
2,Constant Recharge,"I don't know why people have given so many good reviews for this iron but my experience for the past two weeks is that the iron has to be recharged four times to finish one cotton pants. Pain in the neck! When it's fully charged, it's really great. Yet, iron is useless real quick. Once pressing for steam doesn't work, that means iron isn't hot anymore. So, back to the base, again, and, again, and, again! Then I have to turn the setting from Level 3 (highest) to Off and then back to Level 3, again, so the iron would recharge. If I just leave it on the base to recharge, it doesn't seem to be hot at all. Well, big plus to have it cordless, but, my iron time has more than double. I'd recommend a Rowenta iron which I used to have. It was more effective and lasted over five years. In conclusion, this cordless Panasonic iron is good but not effective!"
4,Glad I went cordless; but with it had more POWER,The Iron is quite good - heats quickly and isn't too heavy. But I wish it got just a little bit hotter. I quilt and that is it's prime use for me.
4,Good for Light work,For me this iron works out well. I iron only about 6 long sleeve men's dress shirts and a few other items each week. The iron is light and easy to fill with water for steam. You have to re-educate yourself to set it in the base to reheat. My negatives with the iron are that it has no spray for deep wrinkles and must return to base on large items to reheat. For small items it works out fine.
3,No water spray feature,The product works well except when you want to iron wrinkled cotton clothes because you cant spray water and iron. The steam alone is not good enough to get out the wrinkles.
2,Not enough heat,I iron some pretty heavy shirts and this iron just didn't cut it in the end. The heat generated was not enough to avoid wrinkles caused by the iron going over the shirt. I went back to my corded iron and saw how much better constant heat was for ironing. I really wanted to like this iron but it just didn't deliver unfortunately. Hopefully Panasonic can improve in future models.
4,Still have to plug it in,"The iron works well, but you still have to be close to an outlet to plug in the base. Also, you don't have a lot of time off the base before it loses temperature and has to be set on the base to ""re-charge"". Otherwise, a nice product for those hard-to-iron items where a cord would get in the way."
2,Doesn't stay hot long enough,"I got this item and was very excited, the features looked great. Cordless, you can take the tank off, nice case, etc.I also had an expatiation that I would be able to use the iron to iron 1 piece of garment such as a shirt, to my big surprise this wasn't true. The iron stays hot enough to iron one slave only, if you continue ironing without re-heat the results are not very good.The Iron worked fine on garments that don't require high heat such a sweaters"
4,Cordless Iron,"If ya gotta iron, ya gotta iron. At least I'm not tangled up in the cord anymore. Still have to select an appropriate place so that I'm near an outlet. I'll know more about how well it holds up in a few months."
5,Wow. This iron works great!,I read most of the reviews on this iron and some of people commented on it does not stay hot long enough and it does not get the shirts crisp enough. I have not found that at all. I iron all my husbands collard shirts and it does a fantastic job. I can not tell you how freeing it is not to have the cord getting in the way. the base is super easy to use. The iron just sets in perfectly every time. I only paid 43.00 and that included shipping and i love it mush more then my 100.00 iron. Well worth it.
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I just used this iron for the first time, and I love it. Ironing goes much quicker without a cord.I had no problems with heat, and the steam was strong.One nice feature...when you set the iron back on it's base (while you're adjusting the clothes), you set it on the base and fancy little rollers glide it into place. So it's really easy to set it down and pick it up.I just ironed three shirts, quicker than ever."
5,Best Iron I've EVER had!!!,This iron is amazing! I've been using it for about 5+ years now. I love the removable water container and the base but the absolute best feature is that it doesn't have a cord to get caught on everthing. My only complaint is that I didn't buy 2 of them and stick one in the back of the cupboard when this one is done...however...it gets used on 7+ outfits per week and is still going strong. Absolute best iron ever!!!
2,Sending it back,"I was so looking forward to this iron after reading all the positive reviews. This iron lost heat so quickly I couldn't finish ironing the small area on the iron surface. It had an excellent jet of steam, liked that a lot. Then the iron wouldn't heat back up unless I cycled through all the settings (off, 1, 2 then to 3). This meant it took about 20-30 seconds to heat back up, much more time than I needed to readjust my piece of clothing. This iron is going back and I will be getting an iron with a cord."
2,Save you money,Wish I had bought a regular iron. This one does not get as hot and does not put out the steam. I have to use a spray bottle. It just does not do the job.Lou Mallion
2,It's just not that good,"I gotta tell you -- I'm not sure why everyone seems to be raving about this iron. I've had it for a month and decided to give it away because it just isn't that good. For starters, the cordless feature is not a big deal because you need to have the corded base nearby to return the iron to try to keep it hot. And it just doesn't get that hot."
2,Nice if you don't mind ironing in a raincoat.,"I bought this iron barely 6 months ago and was thrilled with it in the beginning. It does iron very well. The problem is, it has started to leak. Just within the last month or so what started as a slow, small leak, is now leaking so badly the water is running out through the base. I've tried to call Panasonic numerous times and am now convinced there are no humans working there at all. I could never get past the automated runaround. I've just ordered the Maytag cordless and I doubt I'll ever buy anything from Panasonic again."
4,Never Thought It Would Work,"We've had our iron for 2 weeks now -- and much to our amazement, it works great. At first, I thought the water tank was too small--but using the medium steam setting, the water tank lasted far longer than any other iron we've used. The iron is also not as heavy as prior irons we've had, so it's easier and less tiring to use. It stays hot, just as advertised, and I do not find it distracting to have the base sitting on the ironing board, like I thought I would.The one negative is that the retractable cord not only is not easily or automatically retractable, we could not even manually get it to retract into the base unit. We resorted to wrapping the cord around the iron before putting the top back on the unit to store it."
2,Less than what was hoped for,"There are better publications such as 'Easy Beans'. Actually, just searching the internet and getting lots of free recipes is the best of all worlds."
1,Delonghi garbage,"I agree with everything written about this piece of junk. First, it was sent to me with a defective tank, so that the unit wouldn't even turn on. They sent me a replacement (2 months later). Then it turned on, but wouldn't work - no matter how long it was on and no matter what the temperature or humidity conditions were.I now have to send it back - at my expense - to get fixed. What garbage!!!"
1,Good idea..no output!,The dehumidifier appeared well designed and the idea of the pump is excellent; it just did not work. I contacted several of the factory service centers and all told me they no longer did service on any DeLonghi products due to lack of factory support of the product. I returned it to Amazon.com and was very pleased with the immediate and professional response. I would still like to have a replacement of a similar product(that worked) however Amazon does not have any more of them.
1,unbelievable! piece of junk,"Got a new from Costco and run one day. No single drop of water inside of bucket! (The room level was 65%, I set to 50%, and made sure the compressure unit was run, not fan. Even more stupid: I set to 80% (room level is still 65%), it still run forever at ""auto"" mode. What a junk!"
1,Don't bother,"If you are already an expert in Enterprise Data Architecture then this book may make some sense to you, but as an introduction the book tries to cover too much material without explaining any topic in sufficient detail. The author's first language is clearly not English, and the book is full of sentences that just don't make sense in English."
1,Save your money,"Was handed this book by my old boss, he told me to take a look at it and tell him what I thought. I read through it and really did not find it worth my time. When I told my boss the same thing, he said he agreed and just wanted to get a 2nd opinion on the book. It contains lots of general information, there are much better books out there that do a better job at introducing EA."
5,Chip has a love interest,"Peggy Armstrong is about as close as Chip gets to being interested in girls in these early Chip Hilton books, but she is a match for him. Too bad he has to go back to Valley Falls at the end of the book. He could have been manager, star and gotten the girl, too. Good reading for all kids--girls included."
2,Indistinctive,"Tastes indistinctive ... not vanilla, not buttery, not nutty. Also has pasty aftertaste. I remember Glucerna Butter Pecan as tasting rich and buttery. I don't know what this is, but this is my first and last purchase. I even tried blending with lactose free vanilla ice cream and whipping it up into a frothy shake. LOOKED pretty."
1,Does not work as advertised,"After installing this product it does not work worth a flip. Unless the receiver is 40 feet away it consistently looses signal and starts alerting when the garage door is down. I think this would be a good product if they would have made the transmitter or receiver better. Great idea, bad implementation. Also tried to use the regular door sensor and the magnet is way too weak and has to practically be touching the sensor to work. I would not recommend purchasing this product at all as it does not work worth a crap. Stay away..."
1,Product is not accurate and does not work for ranges over 15 feet,"I didn't listen to the warnings of other reviews and made the mistake of spending $60 for this product (combo garage door and sensor). Basically, it does not work very accurately unless you are within 15 feet. If there are two walls, then you are probably looking at less. Beware.."
1,Bad range,"Product states 300 foot range. Well I am at 80 feet and the reception doesn't work.....I contacted Mfr and they state that 300 feet is clear sight no obstructions (Advertisement doesn't say that). Anyway, they told me to move the units closer or remove obstructions. Neither option is viable."
2,faulty receiver????,Alert light #3 which doesn't even have a sensor continuously flashes.The motion sensor is so sensitive you can't use it outside. I don't know what sets it off.You can't stop it from alerting so it's waking my kids up when I leave for work.
2,Ineffective alert system,"I bought this kit 2 years ago. Since then, I found the garage door detectors to be erratic in their responses. I have positioned the receiver and the sensors to be less than 40 feet. Even within this proximity, when the garage doors are closed, the alarm still continues giving alert signals. However, the motion sensor behaves more consistently.Overall, I do not think this will make a good purchase."
4,Poems of nostalgia and Wales,"This book is a compilation of Thomas' sessions at the BBC. There are poems in prose and in verse. His style transmits nostalgia for his native Wales. Some of the best parts are his sketches of other Welch poets. A highly recommendable book by one very good poet, the same one who died in New York at the Chelsea hotel, after having more than 40 scotchs with soda. His poetry is rhythmical and clear, very imaginative and precise."
3,Dead Grass,"I thought Grass' use of language rivaled Nabokov in sheer enjoyment of reading, but the story here wandered and was a little pointless. I was assigned this in a German film class, and enjoyed the film version of ""The Tin Drum"" much more."
3,quirky fable not up to Tin Drum calibre..,"This second installment of the Danzig Trilogy was an overall disappointment. While Gunter Grass's flair for story-telling is all here, Cat and Mouse does not stretch into the varied themes touched by Tin Drum (..the first book of the trilogy). Cat and Mouse reads more like an early John Irving novel (..with a German/Polish twist) rather than profound literature (with all due respect to Mr. Irving, who has written some wonderful stuff in recent years).Cat and Mouse is a story growing up (..mostly high school years) in German occupied Poland during WW II. The characters are quirky (..especially the boy with a protruding Adam's apple) and amusing. But this coming-of-age tale has been told better elsewhere.Bottom line: read Tin Drum. Cat and Mouse will seem stale (and hastily written) by comparison, but fans of Gunter Grass probably won't complain much."
2,What on Earth is this book talking about??!!,"Being a member of a local book club, I was given an Arabic print of this book to read. From the first paragraph, I could not comprehend a single word, so I blamed it all on the Arabic translator and bought an English one. Still, no luck. I felt quite stupid for not understanding a Nobel winner book! but after reading reviews here and there, I came to the conclusion that this novel can only be read in its native language, German.So if you cant read German, I dont suggest that you toture yourself with reading any other version of it."
2,a let-down,"I loved the Tin Drum-- one of my favorite books of all times-- and also really liked ""peeling the onion."" but this was a let-down. It just went on and on about the daily life of the school boys and seemed to have no point. maybe I just didn't get it."
5,Beautiful and heartbreaking,"Beautiful and heartbreaking, this is a story about two school friends, taking place in Germany during World War II.Pilenz is one of a crowd of teenaged boys who like to hang out together at the beach, occasionally swimming out together to a partially submerged Polish minesweeper. Mahlke is just a kid who wants to belong.But Mahlke is deeply flawed, Pilenz explains. He is independent, inventive, original and individual, at a time when it was deadly dangerous to deviate in any way from the crowd. With dread, the reader begins to understand that, in telling this story, the narrator is performing a kind of atonement, seeking to repent of an as-of-yet unnamed sin.A profoundly moving book. You don't have to look far to find the enemy, says Grass. He is already there, inside you, waiting for just the right time to pounce."
1,Worked for about 3 months,"I used this to connect my phones 2.5mm output to my 3.5mm aux jack in my car.after about 3 months of occasional use it no longer makes a reliable connection.This one has lasted me over a year, and the ""gray"" one works fully with my Nokia E71:[...]oops, amazon will not let me post the link.The good one is made by Maximo product and comes with the iP-HS5 headset, but if you call them you can order it separate."
1,Poor design,Plastic casing is too wide. Cannot correctly seat plug into phone because plastic prevents it from completely inserting. Unusable on the device for which I purchased this.
2,beware,"was not a 'deal' @ 14.99, weighs a ton & huge, if into wrist weights, no inst, as to shorten band, second hand 'off' like a junker, caveat emptor"
5,Encouraging,I have really enjoyed reading this book. It is filled with encouragement for mothering God's way. I would Highly recommend!
5,Fantastic and inspiring book!,I have loved reading this book! It has encouraged and inspired me in my parenting. Thank you Sally for articulating so many issues we face in molding our children towards a heart for Christ.
2,Not very neutral,"This is a good book if you are a stay at home mom. Otherwise, you will walk away from this book feeling judged and condemned for not providing the proper nurturing and loving home for your children. Sally tries to sound like she is not saying you should stay at home, but it's pretty clear that's what she thinks. As for me- my husband decided to quit his job on a whim and leave me as the sole worker in our home, so needless to say I don't have the option to do what Sally thinks I should do. Does that mean I do not love my kids wholeheartedly? I was hoping to receive godly wisdom and encouragement as a mom, not judgment because I'm not doing it her way."
5,"Every Mother needs to read, own, and live out this book!","I have never met Clay and Sally Clarkson, but they are my mentors. Of anybody I ""know"" (when you read peoples books, you come to know them, especially authentic authors like the Clarksons) I aspire to parent like them. This book is refreshing, and I am going to give it along with Clay's ""Heartfelt Discipline"" to all the new mothers I know."
5,Excellent book,I'm a career woman with a doctorate who is now a stay at home mom to 2 boys. After reading Clarkson's book I no longer have any qualms about my decision to stay home. Clarkson also gives excellent suggestions for fun things to experience together as a family.
4,As a Chrisitan/Catholic,"Overall a very good book. I found it to be very useful. However, being a Catholic, I had a hard time swallowing the mentioning of Jesus having brothers and sisters. Catholics do not believe that Mary and Joseph had any Children together - and that Mary remained Ever Virgin even after the birth of Jesus.Besides the differing views on Theology I would recommend this book to Catholics who have a good grasp of what the Catechism teaches. If you read it understanding that the author has different theological views than you - I think you could get a lot out of the book."
4,Very Good Baton,"The baton came in great condition, however, shipping arrived a few days late. Nevertheless, overall experience was satisfactory."
5,silence,"i only got to say a couple things... u want honesty and truth? get this book, thats the bottom line_"
1,The outrageous bias renders this book unbelievable...,"I suspect that the author of ""Silencing Political Dissent"" (Nancy Chang) is sincere and has good intentions. But the book is a gross overreaction to laws that have been passed since 9/11.Even worse, Chang's obvious, sometimes vicious (or so it seems to me), blatant bias against the current administration renders the contents of the book completely unbelievable (and, quite frankly, laughable).The fact is that I DO dissent, and I do so without fear. Thus how can I possibly believe Chang's assertions? No. Scare tactics, whether from the far-left or from the far-right, do not affect me.I would NOT recommend this book to a friend.Of course, this review (including all of the above paragraphs) is merely my opinion."
3,The only complete recording,"This is the only complete recording of this piece, though excerpts are available on other recordings, including those of John Elliot Gardiner and Raymond Leppard, whom I prefer.Christie's tempi are often so fast they harm the character of the pieces, in my opinion; his orchestra has to be virtuosic indeed to keep up, and while impressive, I find it muscally wanting.A few of the dances are played on pennywhistles and musettes (a sort of bagpipe) instead of as orchestrated by Rameau, and while the liner notes give an historically-informed argument for doing this, I'd rather hear the originals.Finally, the singing is not always first rate, and I find some of the performances so mannered that they quickly pall.All that said, it's a wonderful piece, and the true Rameau fanatic will want to own this despite its many shortcomings."
2,dont be fooled.,people review these things online way too soon.its the same as any other powered toothbrush with a spinning head.doesnt do anything special...the head doesnt even spin it just turns back and forth about 10 degrees.the heads were used up within about 2-2 1/2 mothns so i just switched over to a regular electric toothbrush for half the price.
4,Love this,"I had an interplak once before, but the batery life was limited and after a bit would not hold a charge. I switched to a sonic care. Sonic care is a rip off. Lots of money for little cleaning. Now I have an interplak again and my mouth is refreshed after using. I should have bought 2."
5,My cat loves it!,"My cat has a bad case of dermititis. I ordered this product and started using it two days ago. I already see an improvement. The fragrance is mild and pleasant. The Cat Bath Foam must not be irritating her condition, because she actually will stand there and let me massage it into her coat."
5,Love this product!,My cat came in with such a smell one day and I washed her down with this and it was gone immediately. She didn't seem to mind the nice smell and it dried within a short time. I had never used a waterless bath foam before but very happy with this product.
3,From Back Cover,"For over twenty years, Blythe Benning had kept a secret from her teenage sweetheart, the man she loved--the man who'd fathered her child. Because Blythe had given their baby up for adoption. And she'd never stopped regretting it.Then Brent Morrison stormed back into her life. Was it an accident, or fate? Blythe could only tremble at the powerful feelings the handsome architect still raised with a look, a touch, a kiss.Blythe knew that now was the time to face Brent with the truth...about everything! Together, could they find their long-lost child?"
5,pleased!,"I bought it used, and the book matches the description of the condition. I'm pleased with it! Bought it for 5 bucks,which makes me a very happy customer. Also, it came on time!"
3,"Book okay, but took forever.","I', very glad that I didn't need this book right away because it took absolutely forever to get. I understand that with inexpensive shipping you can't always expect things to come quickly, but with every other seller I've dealt with I've gotten products within a week. This is the first time something took more than that and it was even outside of the allotted time period.The only saving grace was that the book itself was in good condition, though it had to be in the weirdest packaging I've ever seen, which stuck to the book and was a bit difficult to get off."
1,Complete Waste of Money!,"I bought this item after looking for years for something that would fit on my 8' wide deck. It was just big enough for two chairs and a small table--a haven from the bees and mosquitos and somewhere to sit at night and read. I was thrilled to find this.I was LESS than thrilled, however, when exactly 32 days later (note the 30 day warranty)the handi-wipe material on the top completely disintegrated! I wish I could attach a photo to this review. Now, bear in mind that I live in upstate NY--not the Arizona desert. Yes, it's been a sunny and hot summer (just exactly the type you'd want a screen room for)but this is absolute junk unless you plan to take it down and put it away as soon as you come out of it.If you're looking for a screen room, buy a conventional one for under $50 that will hold up much longer than 32 days! I would actually give this item a NEGATIVE 5 stars."
2,"NOT my idea of ""very good"" condition","I was disappointed when I got my book and it was NOT in ""very good"" condition for a used book. It has front cover wear, and a rip on the back cover. There is many marred pages on top corner that are dirty. Not worth the money I paid in my standards. I was very bummed since I use this book extensively as a Professor, and needed my own copy. I will just have to keep looking....Hope ""very good"" condition bums up its standards soon....unnamed DR."
1,Flora Fraser doesn't have the gift of writing like her mother...,"Flora is NOT Antonia Fraser. She can't write her way out of a hole in the ground. This book was one of the most boring accounts of Emma that I have ever heard! There was nothing fascinating, exciting, or even eventful in this book. I could barely finish this, and some important aspects of her life are glossed over in such a boring fashion that one who didn't know any better would wonder how important they were. Boring, worse-than-textbook reading, if you must read this, buy it used."
1,Incredibly slow reading,"The author takes a fastinating life and makes it into tedious reading. If you like dull endless detail, this is the book for you. I couldn't even finish and I am an avid reader!"
3,Ok,"This is a decent product -- as you would expect from Panasonic. It operates as well as my old Black and Decker Dustbuster, but when you put it in it's wall mount you have to manually plug it in (to charge the battery). Stupidity of design from a Japaneese company -- surprising."
5,Power Disc Brake M C Kit,"Amazon offered this high quality master cylinder rebuild kit for a 1 1/8"" bore. Just like kits which I have used in the past 25 years! Their quality is very consistent! Highly recommended if you are rebuilding a GM power disc brake master."
3,Smell is too strong.,"I'm currently pregnant and wanted to try this lotion on myself before baby is born. It is very watery but moisturizes well, a little goes long way. But the scent is overpowering, it is too strong for me, so I'm not going to use on baby. On top of that this scent is kid of aggressive, very flowery. I prefer LaVanila Baby Lotion much better-great ingredients and truly baby smell."
1,Rash alert!,"This thing made me and my baby break out in a rash, twice! We double checked but it happened every time we used this product."
4,Yummy baby lotion,"Mustela Hydra-Bebe Body LotionSilky skin, gentle to baby, and the most scrumptuous scent ever: This lotion goes on quite greasy at first, but use only a small amount for less oiliness. It's a hydrating lotion quite popular in Europe and the Orient. Exceptional gift for those of discerning tastes."
3,item does not include what the box says,"I purchased this item from Amazon expecting the cone roller to come with it. (3 different places on the box say includes cone roller). When it arrived,there was a small sticker placed on the top of the box that says ""due to difficulties with production, the cone roller is no longer available"". I never would have purchased this item without the cone roller. After a long discussion with Amazon customer service, I finally got them to give me a $20 credit. I was first offered an apology and nothing, then $10 after more discussion, finally $20. I then ordered a cone roller from another seller on Amazon which cost me $14 including S&H. My credit wouldn't apply to this purchase. Make sure you get what you ordered, and stick to your guns when discussing anything with Amazon customer service."
3,CucinaPro 220-02 Krumkake Baker,"The product is fairly good. It did not have the stated rollers in the box. They were missing. It does not brown as evenly as I had hopped. Clean up is good, the size is good. It is easy to use, and the Krumkake is pretty."
4,Krumkaka Baker,The only thing I was disappointed about was that the wooden cone was not included like it said it would be.
1,CUCINAPRO 220-02 KRUNKAKE,"When this item was purchased it had ""rollers""included. When the package arrived it had a sticker applied that ""rollers not incluied"", the packaging indicated they were included.I caled Amazon and received a Ten dollar credit. It cost me about $30.00 to buy 2 on line.Amazon should forced the vender to give me the ""roller"" for free since they wer on the orginal web page.Deceptive advertizing and poor customer policy by Amazon"
3,Griddle mold too shallow,"I am disappointed with this machine for 2 reasons: 1st-the griddle mold is very shallow & it is difficult to make the krumkake form the round imprinted shape desired & 2nd-no cone roller is included. My krumkakes end up looking like lacy doilies or when made thicker, they run over the mold & out the sides of the machine.Outside of the above issues, the machine is easy to use & clean up."
1,Cant use it in Australia due to the power difference :-(,Live in Australia and cried as I cant use any of your electrical items due to the different power here...
4,Excelent Guide...Covers all aspects!,"As many people have already stated, German Grammar is not easy to learn. There are many aspects of it that need to be learned as well as many exceptions...Luckily, this book covers all the rules and exceptions accompanied with countless examples... Everything from (Dative,Accusativ,Nominativ,Genitiv) is here, as well as pronouns, adjectives, verbes, preposition, word order and more...The only thing I noticed is that there are a couple of mistakes in this book...However, since there are thousands of examples I think 1 or 2 mistakes won't confuse anybody...Even some of the German people I know get the grammar mixed up sometimes, so dont worry!"
1,Schaum's Outlines German Grammer,"I tried many other books, but this one helped or is helping me the best. Each chapter has good easy to follow, step by step learning, and then examples and tests, and you can correct it yourself the answers are in the back. I am really please and it is helping me alot along with another program I have."
1,One of the absolute worst,"Only Last Broadcast is worse. Poorly made. Lousy acting, cheesy special effects, forgetable story. Not even a die hard Turkey lover such as myself can tolerate this steamy bit of poopie. Avoid it like the plaque."
2,"Keep your ""kingdom."" Just LEMME OUT!!","I have never encountered writings that made me happier with my Anabaptist heritage than these wacko reconstructionist rantings by Chilton/North/Rushdooney et al! Talk about (in Hubmaier's phrase) ""making peace with none but bloody Caesar!"" These guys want to usher in a ""Theocracy"" of fatalism, Neo-Genevan ""blue laws,"" and picked-and-chosen Mosaic legalism. Ah, the tender mercies of strict Calvinism!Chilton's ""paradise"" will sound like a lot of things to you, but it won't sound like the kingdom described by the Lord Jesus!If you are a dispensational believer (as am I) I actually urge you to read this book-- just do it CAREFULLY! You will never fear these theological bullies again-- they are more ridiculous than Thomas Munster ever was!!"
4,Ghost Songs - The Reality of a Place,"Ghost Songs provides a remarkably clear sense of place. Ms. Abdul-Baki clearly knows Palestine and the Arabs there. This love story is set in the midst of some of the most famous and coveted places on earth, and her love for the people and places she write about is apparent. She has set a story in the present, but with links to some of the events of the past century in a manner that displays an extraordinary understanding of the people and motivations of those involved. Clear exposition, with fascenating, but believable, plot twists characterize her work. She writes as a powerful spokesperson for those who might appear as flickering, shadowy figures on the evening news. It is a love story, with universal appeal."
5,A must-carry reference for the ecotourist in Costa Rica!,"This is the first really comprehensive, backback-suitable wildlife guide for ecotouring in Costa Rica that I've come across. It combines information from the best possible sources and includes much of what you are likely to encounter in various regions of the country. Well-organized and easy to use, this is a must-carry reference guide! My thanks and congratulations to the author!"
4,Great Book!,"Hi, I am working at ILISA Spanish Language Institute in San Jose, Costa Rica and I just want to say that this book helps our students a lot by giving them helpful inside information and thus by getting to know all the ins and outs about this fantastic country. Thanks!"
3,Under expectation.,"Ok, so I am patiently waiting, and I check amazon at a regular basis to see how long until it is supposed to arrive, 5-17 days.. ok waiting, the day after I egt it (I was thinking, holy cow, this is some awesome service, it arrives 4 days earlier than estimated!) now, I open it, and what do I get? Well, I do get a fully functioning adapter, but it is scratched (only minor ones), it has a production fault which leaves a sharp picece of plastic sticking out (not really a problem though) and the conenctor is rusty and slightly corroded. But since it works flawlessly I will keep the rating high."
2,wire problems,"This product works great, I have had mine for about a month now. But, there is a problem with the connection of the wires that run out from the circuit board to the usb. If you twist it to much they become disconnected and then the whole thing becomes useless, unless you have a soldering tool to reconnect them."
5,Works as advertised suprisingly!,"This lets me play emulated games on OSX! (without the disc. PC requires it)Only problem I had is when I used an OLD and crappy 3rd party controller in the adapter and it didn't work, but other than that it works great! I am using an old psx controller and I've had zero problems with it connected to the adapter!Now I need to find a good psx/ps2 controller with a one-piece solid d-pad. :)"
1,Very cheap quality...worked for a couple of hours,"Very bad quality/durability. It worked for a couple of hours, then stopped working. It was fun while it lasted, although that wasn't long.I installed the drivers and plugged it in. Everything worked fine. I used it with the ePSXe emulator for about 2 hours. Then I exited ePSXe and took a break for a couple of hours. I left the Adapter and controller connected to the computer. When I returned to continue playing, the adapter stopped working. My computer wouldn't recognize the adapter anymore. I tried unplugging it and plugging it. I tried reinstalling the drivers. I also tried plugging the adapter into other computers. Nothing worked.I guess I received a faulty adapter. I'm going to buy the Super Joy Box 5 this time. I recommend you do the same."
2,Fast Shipping,"It is plug-and-play and uses basic Windows drivers, but some games do not recognize the controller. I tried to use this with Borderlands and Rusty Hearts, and neither game recognized the controller as being there. Dead Island did see it, but the controls were jacked up and could not be configured. The only game that I tried it with that worked, was Archon: Classic. I wound up purchasing a Logitech F510 Rumble Gamepad, which has worked flawlessly."
5,Very good!!!!!,"Excellent, now i can play in my computer >Dquickly send and good conditionsthanks you!!!You are good sellers"
4,Just past halfway there...,"Got it promptly, but the thing actually had a crack/indentation in it. Of the two ports, one works perfectly, while for the second, it doesn't seem to support the analog functions of a controller at all (but the other buttons get though). Very tempted to return it and get another one, because it definitely works, but mine came slightly broken in the mail."
2,It doesn't register the ps2 controller correctly,"I enjoyed paying ps2 games as a kid, and once I got a computer that was capable of playing games, I wanted to use a playstation 2 controller to do it as I was used to it. Hookup was easy, and the drivers installed without a hitch, but once I started playing games, the controller worked intermittently and made it impossible to use. I found out that the ps2 controller registers pressure for some of the buttons, but this just determines if a button pressed down or not, so the functionality of the ps2 controller is lessened greatly. I tried another controller, so I am sure that the problem is coming from this device. I'm not sure if I am just unlucky (seeing as this is rated highly, but it didn't work for me, so prospective buyers should be wary.P.S. I am using a pc running windows vista."
3,Good i guess...,"Works, but not really worth buying. If you want a gamepad you should just get on that is designed for PC, works out alot eaisier"
3,It works but you can't re-map buttons,"It works but you can't remap buttons. The cd that came with the converter did not work. No software will allow you to remap buttons. I'm purchasing another converter Super Dual Box Pro from mayflash dot com, your suppose to be able to remap buttons with software. I've already downloaded mayflash software and it looks like it would work perfectly."
2,Nominal usefulness,"After buying this product to play online games using the playstation controls, we found that there are very few games online games that would translate to the paystation controller, after all so it was of low usefulness to us."
2,Works but Drivers Disc is malware.,"BEWARE of the Device Drivers disc. This little blue CD-R with a Panda on it contains nothing but malware executables straight out of China. Virus/Keylogger malware on a CD-R coming straight from China, big surprise...Product automatically works with Windows 7 64-bit without the ""device drivers"" disc. My Logitech wireless PS2 controller is recognized as a Twin USB Joystick."
1,Not the super dual box.,Well i Thought this was the Super Dual Box but instead i get this dinky thing that i cant get to work right.
1,does not work a waste of money!!!!,This item did not work as advertised. My computer saw a controller in the usb port but the controller did not function. Maybe the driver supplied was wrong? I would not recommend this to anyone!
1,"watch out, i got ripped off","Playstation 2 to PC USB Gamepad ConverterI bought this exact item, but i ended up with the cheap one that doesnt work vith vista =("
1,POS,This doesn't work. I tried it in 4 different systems including Vista 64/32 and XP 32bit. No drivers came with the product and windows can't determine what it is. DON'T BUY!!!
5,Playstation 2 to PC USB Gamepad Converter,"The product works as advertised. We use it mostly with MAME32 and other PC games with no problems. Installation could not be easier. Just plugged it into a free USB port on an XP machine. There are were drivers to install or needed.If you want to use your PS/2 gamepads with a PC, this is a great product to use and I recommend it."
4,ps2 usb adapter,i think this is cool its neat to be able to use your playstation controller for your pc and this one can do two so thats even better and its a really great price!
4,Works well,It can be a good alternative if you don't want to pay for PC controllers and you have Playstation 2 controllers.
1,it does not work,"other than an led that lights when plugged into a usb port, this product remains unrecognized by my windows 7, and the drivers on the disc that comes with it do not help. It tells you to have direct x version 7 or higher installed, and my win7 came with version 11, if that tells you anything about the age of this product.It does not work, but did not cost enough to bother returning. Sound familiar?"
1,disapointed,well. I need a adapter converter for playing dance dance revolution on my computer. it works but it won't let you do jumps (step on two arrows at the same time) and that's fine and dandy if you're going to just do novice level forever. I like doing the higher levels so it a disappointment to me. and with my old adapter if it wasn't letting you do jumps you could push up start select at the same time and then it would let you do it. but not this one.
1,Help!!!,"I received the adapter and i cant get it to work. I am running windows vista 64 bit. The cd that came with it doesnt install any drivers, it just comes up with what look like to be an install screen but just shows a bunch of question marks. My computer recognizes the adapter but not the controllers. Please send me a driver that will run this adapter so i can finally start playing my games!!! If anyone can help please do so!!"
1,Avoid like the plague if you intend to use it on win7 or xp 64bit,"I bought this hoping to use two DDR pads with my PC and Stepmania. I spent about a day trying to get it to work and Windows 7 could never recognize it correctly. It always detected some error while configuring it. It came with no drivers for Vista but I found some online, they did not work either. I then tried using it on Windows XP 64-bit and same result. Tried OSX and did not work either. I know it was cheap and I guess in this case I got what I paid for. Unless you're running XP 32bit or older, avoid this thing. Save your money!"
4,"Works as advertised, except on MacBook Pro","Like it says above, it works as advertised. Mind you I don't have a Windows machine, so I couldn't test it on that. However, I do have both Linux and Mac machines at my disposal. The Linux (Ubuntu 11.04 Classic) recognized it immediately, no problem.The Mac would see it in System Profiler (Apple menu>About This Mac...>More Info...), but the game wouldn't. This game does recognize a Microsoft joystick, so it wasn't the game causing the problem.The packaging was simple, unlabeled (someone might think it's a bomb! Just kidding). The shipping was good and speedy. Can't say the exact number of days, as I was out of town upon its arrival.Long story short: Good idea; cheap, decent product. Not bad for $1.45 (price may vary)."
5,It works Well!!,"It's works well on my MackBook Pro with Windows 7 installed. The package brings the installation CD but in my case, It doesn't was necessary because Windows detects it automatically.It's very cheap and great quality construction. In my case, I don't care the vibration.Very Nice!"
5,DEFINITELY WORTH IT!!!,"WORKS PERFECTLY, BUT YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE XPADDER TO MAKE IT WORK AT A 100%.DEFINITELY WORTH IT !!! :)"
1,Dosen't work,"I bought this for 6 bucks so i could play call of duty mw2 on my laptop and i got it and plugged it in and it works when you test and calibrate it, but not during actual play. Now its just taking up space on my desk."
1,Doesn't work properly with Stepmania,"While the price was great, this adapter doesn't work with Stepmania - at least not with my redoctane ignition pad. It doesn't support hitting two buttons at the same time which is essential for jumps. I installed the drivers and I mapped the keys within Stepmania, but it just wouldn't work properly. And even hitting the single buttons on the pad seemed sluggish and the scores were terrible - impossible to pass a song even on an easy level. I tried the start/select/up arrow trick for DDR mode, which didn't seem to change anything. It's simply unacceptable for Stepmania. I returned the product to Amazon...at least the return was very easy."
4,Works well with some tinkering.,"This adapter works, but you NEED to download new drivers.Without them, you cannot use it with Stepmania, i did not try it with anything else, but you need to go to their website and download the correct driver.If you are using Vista/Windows 7 download PC027 Super Joy Box 13 from [...], that is their webpage, find the correct version for your OS.No lag in stepping, although my dance mat is garbage, it responds very well.IF you get the clear blue version and it has a RED LED when you plug a controller in, you're fine, BUT if you get a different color with a different color LED, beware, as it may not work.I highly recommend this product."
1,Doesn't work for Dance Pads,"Converter supposedly has the dance pad code incorporated in hardware but is not true. Enclosing says it is compatible with dance pad, but this is not true, works for normal controllers and even the vibration function. It also works with the ps3, so its has its uses. I bought it for the dance pad for my PC, hottest deal won't exchange it and stopped answering my emails when I told them to refund or exchange. Don't recommend the converter or the company."
3,Playstation 2 USB Gamepad Converter,"Pros: Excellent for connecting a game mat for use with Stepmania.Cons: Drivers come on a 3.5"" floppy disk. If your computer doesn't have the drivers you will have to download them.Other: It isn't too hard to find the drivers online."
4,Good stuff.,"Works nicely, plug'n'play. Also has a mini CD with the driver so you can manually install it if the OS doesn't find the driver automatically."
4,Works fine,I've heard that one shouldn't order the light blue colored component and so I got the solid black one. It works like a charm.
4,An almost perfect product,"The converter allows me to use either me Playstation One (PSX/PS1) controllers and my Playstation 2 (PS2) controllers on my computer for use with computer games or emulators. For most intents and purposes the product works pretty well, even if the installation process is a bit awkward. However, the device has a nasty problem with not always recognizing my controller. When this happens, it will randomly remap the buttons of the controller while I'm playing or trying to program the controls. This is very annoying, and can take days or weeks to finally get it to stop. But when it works... it works wonderfully."
5,Works Great,"I'm using Windows XP 64-bit, and I've been able to use it with anything that accepts joystick input, and was able to use the rumble feature on a PlayStation emulator."
3,"Doesn't work for stepmania, otherwise it's great!",The people selling this didn't send the drivers needed to make this work for dance pads. They didn't know much about the product and while they were polite they weren't very helpful. If you download the drivers for the Dilong203 then this will have rumble enabled. I'm gonna go ahead and buy the EMS usb2 though because it doesn't need drivers it lets you connect two controllers and it works for everything I want it to work for.
2,Guitar Hero Controllers have some issues.,"I have 2 PS2 Guitar Hero Guitars, one wired and one wireless. Both work just fine, with one exception - they refuse to work at the same time.Well, that and the whammy bars don't work, but that is a known issue with PS2 guitars, nothing specific to this adapter.With that being said, these converters are cheap enough, I'm wagering that two separate adapters will remedy this *crosses fingers*"
4,"Minor problems, but not bad","The package came in perfect condition, and the product itself looked physically fine. Vista auto detected drivers, and it was essentially plug and play. However, the player 2 port kept continuously registering the down button. Player 1 port works fine, and since I will be playing by myself, the Player 2 port problem isn't going to effect me."
5,USB Dual Controller Rocks!!!,"Instantly, without the disc, this device gave me my old days of sitting near my television a reality again. The drivers for it were installed quickly without the disc. This was a plug and play device if you ask me! Overall, no lag. I was expecting a lag in this device, but no, there doesn't seem to be one. Of course, to get more features out of it, the cd will be required, other than that, It works great!"
3,Ordered for PS3,"works well although it detects 2 controllers when only one is connected and the plastic feels cheap, but it cost $5.00 so i cant complain"
3,Wheres my vibration??,"It works fine, but for some reason I can't get the vibration function to work."
3,Order with caution!,"I'm sure this product does what it's supposed to do, and I think it's great if you want to play Stepmania, but I'm just urging people to be cautious, because this model was NOT the one I ordered. It was the one that wasn't compatible with step. The one that was shipped to me was the Dilong adapter, which while looks the same, (save for the frosted appearance) isn't compatible with Step. It took a lot of additional work to make it actually function with the game, and I don't know if it was worth the hassle. Order with caution!"
5,Works great. DDR mode may or may not work.,"I received the converter and it certainly functioned as I would have thought it would. It allowed me to use a playstation controller with my computer. I mainly use this converter for ddr pads. While I couldn't get the up select start or whatever code it is to work (maybe I just wasn't pressing the right buttons, you know mapping issues and all). My pads are wired in such a way that the buttons can be remapped by hardware means using simple connectors into a control box. I simply rewired my left and up arrows to work as button 1 and 2. The mapping doesn't mind in stepmania and I'm all the happier.Product is great. Does what it should. May or may not work in stepmania for you without some extra work."
1,Did not Work,"couldnt get it formatted and it never worked . we still have it I guess we may try again on a different pc but for the one it was intended for it never happened,"
2,this works,I thought this would work for us but it din't work with out system. It was a good price but I needed something different to fix my problem.
2,Did not work for DDR,This item is not compatible with DDR pads due to the fact that it maps the arrow buttons to the analog stick as opposed to the D-Pad.
4,GREAT!!! WORKS WITH MACBOOK PRO!!!!!,"This is awesome, I took a big chance to see if this actually works even with my Macbook pr even though it says it's for windows. And it ACTUALLY WORKED!!!!! but when i connected it it didn't work and i solved the situation. I did some researching on how to connect it... so I purchased ""JoyStick Mapper"" from the Mac apple store. So after that it WORKED!!! But sometimes when i turn on, the mouse that i activated the controller to do goes to the side without me moving it. (but not a really big issue) Recommend to all you mac/pc gamers."
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR DRR STEPMANIA!!!,"The packaging claims this works with DDR / Stepmania. This is false! Do not buy! Will not work with any pads. I've spent 2 days looking for a solution, trying all the workarounds on the stepmania forums that other users have suggested, and still this pad fails to register left+right and up+down simultaneous presses. Worthless if you want to play DDR or Stepmania."
1,it doesn't work,I can not figure this thing out! I t doesn't work and i cannot for the life of me find any instructions to see if i'm doing anything wrong or something. i have a snes emulator and on it i have donkey kong and i still can't play it. i hate to use the keyboard cause its too hard please someone help.
5,"Works Fine, Low Cost",The adapter works just as described with no performance/compatibility issues that I have found. Just plug and play; the adapter was immediately recognized by Vista and XP. Great price too!
3,Big box for very small item,Item was shipped in a box that was 10 times bigger than it was supposed to be.....As a result I had to pay 5 times as much
5,very good,It was quick to deliver. best thing about it it has lasted about 1 year or so now with no hiccups whatsoever. i plug it in and it works right away. is very good for people who use emulators or just like having a game pad for computer games.
4,"Great, Cheap and Fast!","Overall I'd say this is well worth the total of around $4 I spent on it. I'm able to play PC games and emulated games with one of the best controllers ever made and there are two ports so I can play with a friend as well.The only complaint I have is that the design is definitely indicative of a product that costs less than $2. It's rather cheap plastic and even less sturdy looking than the picture. That being said, you shouldn't be throwing it around or stomping on it anyway so just be careful with it and you'll be fine.The disc also broke almost in half during delivery. On my Windows 7 computer I didn't need any drivers, the controller seemed to work fine with an emulator. I'm guessing if you want to key-bind any keyboard keys to the controls you probably need the software that might have been on that disc; I guess I'll never find out."
3,does what it needs to for cheap,"I used this on my mac mini for ePSXe and so far, it works just fine. I just plug it in and it's all set up.I'm not sure if controller rumble works yet, since I'm playing a game that doesn't use that feature, but I don't see any reason it wouldn't.If I had anything bad to say about it, it's that it feels kinda cheap and flimsy. I dont think its going to fall apart though."
4,Beware of imitations,"Beware, if you buy a used Super Dual box adapter or from other merchants, you may or may not receive it but rather you'll receive the Dilong pu203 version which looks exactly like it. Take note that the Super Dual Box has a red LED (although the old ones don't have any at all) and the Dilong has a blue LED. The Dilong doesn't have a dance pad code, so it won't work with StepMania. So take that in mind when looking for the drivers in google. Other than that, it's a great adapter, it works perfectly. The only reason you would need to download the drivers would be for vibration but if you don't need it, you can just go ahead and plug it to your usb and it will install as a human interface device."
1,Useless for gamepads (despite being advertised as good for DDR),"This controller does not recognize multiple key presses (e.g. Up+Left), so it's useless for Stepmania / DDR / gamepad games. Looks like older versions did, but not the one I received in Nov 2010. Also, the manufacturer didn't update the packaging, which still claims that it's compatible with DDR."
1,Don't Purchase,"I purchased this because I had found some information online indicating it would work with Windows 7. Well, that couldn't be farther from the case.Actually, let me rephrase - depending on which random device you receive in the mail, it may or may not work. Mine was not the one pictured, and definitely didn't work. As you can see from other reviews, some people have gotten different ones that do work.Just skip over this, and buy the Super Joy Box Pro 5."
1,Bad for DDR,It tells you right on its package its great for DDR but it does not support left+right or Up+Down steps... makes dancing a little hard when you cant jump
1,Doesn't work. completely useless. DONT BUY!,"It's cheap, for a reason.If you read through all of the reviews here you will find out that by buying this product you are taking a chance in getting one that works, and one that doesn't. There was clearly a large handful of ""Bad Ones"" / Broken adapters shipped out from the manufacturers to 3rd party stores around the world. Because the 3rd party store selling through amazon changes constantly for products, you can get a good one, or a bad one..completely luck.Even if it did work, I doubt it would have lasted long, the product is EXTREMELY cheaply made, very very cheap plastic that'd break very easily, but what do you expect for 5$?I highly recommend you spend a few more dollars and get a higher quality PS2 to PC Adapter, you'll thank yourself later, I guarantee it."
1,Don't Bother with Dance Mats,"Bought this for Stepmania since it's supposed to be compatible with dance mats...not the case. The included CD had nothing on it, so the device installs as a generic USB controller (this is WinXP by the way) , which pretty much means dance mats aren't going to work properly, since you can't step on two arrows at the same time. Trying to track down drivers that might fix this issue on the net is nearly impossible, since this product isn't labelled, has no name, and resembles a few other adapters.Didn't bother checking with a regular Dualshock 2, but I'm sure those work, but really, just use a PS3 or X360 contoller and save yourself a headache."
1,$4 is still expensive,Product works but built very cheap. Feels like 1 fall will break the thing! $4 is still expensive! This looks like something you can get from a dollar store!
1,Cheap imitation,"First of all, this is not a Sony product (as the current product title subtext would suggest). Second, and more importantly, this product will not work with dance pads. Good converters have a code that allows you to switch between analog and digital mode, and this is not a good converter. What this means in practical terms is that jumps will not register if you're using this device."
1,Not for PS3,"even though people have claimed pc and ps3 conversion tools work fine on both platforms (which they should) they don't, this will semi convert and allow normal button hits but no combo hits, so gh2 controllers and ddr pads are a no go for it, so far have not found a converter that actualy will work , looks like its time to fork out for new controllers if i really want them. I am sure this would work fine for some one who has a bunch of ps2 controllers laying around and has games that don't require any combo button press' but just no good for me."
1,Does NOT work on windows 7/8,It simply does not work on windows 7. I bought this to play NBA 2k13 with my old playstation 2 controller. Dissapointed :|
3,Not too bad.,"It's gonna take a bit to figure out how to get it to work with my emulator, and it seems to be a problem with the drivers that I will have to figure out. Hopefully I can get it to work, because it seems promising. The bar isn't really high on something this cheap though. It's not bad quality for the price, just extremely generic that's for sure. The packaging needed some English corrections, but that gave me a good laugh: ""frist"" instead of ""first."" Awesome."
1,just a dead piece of plastic with a red light,"Just received the item. It does nothing. the included mini CD just sits there. nothing happens. i get an error message 'windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. you may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.'is there any info on this item or did i just throw away $5?i use XP sp3 and am trying to play assassins creed with a PS2 controller.please let me know a page i can go to to try a driver for it. Heck, i dont even know what company makes this thing. there are no instructions or any info with it.got it quickly though."
3,meh,you have to get old driver to make dance pad mode work which sucks and are time consuming to find but it works great once you get that done
2,Works sometimes...,"I bought this a couple weeks ago, and overall, it's an okay adapter for $4. My main gripe is that it for the most part doesn't work. It's pretty shoddy at times, and a lot of times will not be recognized by my computer. When it does decide to operate it runs fine (or at least gets the job done). It came with a cd to install the drivers, but it honestly doesn't make a difference from just plugging the adapter in without it. I guess I would say it's worth the $4 gamble, but you should probably spend a few more dollars on a better quality adapter."
1,bad product,This controller did not work. It came with a cd to install on the computer and after doing that it still did not work. I would not recommend this product to anyone at any price.
3,IT WORKS! Kinda...,"Disappointingly, this thing only works with a few of my steam games. With any Valve game, it flat out won't work. The buttons are recognized, but are mapped incorrectly and there doesn't appear to be a way to change it.However, I have gotten it to work with the game Psychonauts, but only because the game allows custom gamepad mapping. So I have that. For the price I paid, I call this worth it.What I recommend to people is to just buy a wired Xbox 360 controller. They're about 30 bucks, and work with almost all games on steam, except for those few which came out before the 360 existed."
3,are the drivers that came with it malign?,"when this adapter came, i plugged it in. my computer wouldn't read it so i tried the cd-rom that came with it. my virus protection software scanned the software and it flagged it as a high risk. in my threat history is listed as pu401+pu303.exe(infostealer.lineage)"
2,Analog Sticks,"Pros:Fast deliveryCheapPlug and play no real thinking requiredCons:Analog sticks are not supported. I tested out 3 different controllers on Assassin's Creed 2, Battlefront 2 and the Microsoft gamepad setup but none of them recognize the analog sticks.That con is a game breaker for me but apparently I'm the only one with this problem."
3,Great,"Besides the fact that is blue and ugly its a great device, works well but i couldnt get it to vibrate. Downloaded driver and worked fine for FFXI"
1,product simply not working,Tried everything and tried to find somethnig or someone who can help but nothing worked bad luck I guess.
1,Failed to deliver performance.,"Picked this up for better success with fighting games, and it is completely nonfunctional by any degree of expectations. It doesn't read inputs clearly at all, and requires you to smash the buttons for any sort of input. It does not read diagonal inputs practically at all, and for anybody who is a high-end player, it can be deemed complete trash.I'm in the process of sending it back now, as it utterly failed to meet my expectations of smooth responsiveness."
2,Issues with StepMania,"While this device works with Vista and can be configured to work with StepMania, the device will NOT allow you to press two buttons simultaneously. As a result, I'll have to find another USB converter for use with my dance pad and StepMania, since I play with my feet constantly pressing the left and right arrows. Be wary!"
1,Product delivered without drivers,"I thought this would be a cool device to save me some money on buying a controller for my PC. Like many other reviewers, I too am experiencing problems with the variability of this item when shipped to you. My major problem is that this adapter arrived with a mini CD for the drivers but the CD was a blank and now this is a useless device because the drivers can not be found online. Though cheep it is a huge waste of money. This is a risky buy."
1,NOT DDR Dance Stepmania compatible,"In contrast to the specs listed here, the item I received does NOT work with dance mats! It fails to process a left+right or up+down jump, since it only accepts analog (not digital) input. This does not work with dance mats! If you want to use it for a dance pad, order something else!"
5,Works With Windows 7,I am able to use my old PS1 controller to play Dark Souls on my PC. It has no problem in windows 7.
1,A note about this for Mac users,"I wanted this so I could play the Assassin's Creed games with a PS2 controller rather than the keyboard and touchpad, in the hopes of the controls being more intuitive and easier that way. I have PC copies of the games, but I'm on a Macbook Pro and run them via Boot Camp. The difficulty here is that the drivers are on a mini-disc, which can't be used in this (or any Apple laptop, I gather) because it's a slot-loader disc drive, not a tray drive. I can't find the drivers online anywhere, though I admit I didn't look super hard. I'm probably going to try and return this device and look for a different one, if there is such a thing, or just give the whole thing up as a lost cause. I don't want it desperately enough to put the disc in a PC laptop and copy the contents onto a full-sized CD.I guess it should be ""warning"" instead of ""note"", since there's absolutely no mention of the driver disc in the item description."
5,Excellent value for its price,The adapter works without any issues on Windows 7 x64 and doesn’t need any drivers. One functionally that isn’t listed in the production description is that you can use it on PS3 with some games.
4,works great!,"The blue plastic is kind of tacky-looking, but it works great for hooking up ps2 dual-shocks to my pc for emulator funtime and is extremely cheap as well so I can't complain. Recommended!"
3,Excellent adapter but doesn't work quite well with dance pad,"This adapter works on Windows 7. But you do have to install a driver (a customer suggested to download EMS USB2). After that, you are all set to play your games. (: But I have problem playing my DDR: can't step on 2 steps at the same time =[]="""
5,I love the product!,The package was shipped in a good amount of time but the only problem I had was they never posted any tracking info. That doesn't really mean anything because it shipped fast! I would recommend anyone to buy this product or any other product that they sell because they are reliable.
2,Poor experience on newer operating systems,"People may have issues when using with newer operating systems. I bought this in the hopes that, while not confirmed to be compatible with, it would work with my Win7 machine. Sadly, it does not. Even with drivers that can be found online, it seems to be hit or miss on whether or not you will get it to work. What does annoy me, however, is that the same can be said for Vista, an operating system listed right on the back of the packaging, and on in the description. Doesn't seem that the drivers needed came with the packaged disc, and after installing drivers I got online, the item seemingly chooses when it does and does not want to work on my Vista machine. This supposedly works fine on older operating systems, but if you have a newer computer, I recommend looking elsewhere. It was cheap, luckily. Though that doesn't change the fact that this is more or less useless to me."
3,it Works,it works as intendeddont bother using the driver cd included since it really doesnt help and AV detects virus/adwares
3,Bought it for StepMania,"I bought this Playstation USB Adapter for the game ""Stepmania"" and it works on all Windows OS: XP 32bits, Vista 32bits, Vista 64bits, 7 32bits, & 7 64bits., but turn out that the combination UP+DOWN and LEFT+RIGHT don't work on any playstation Dance Pad controller. So, if you're buying this to play DDR/Stepmania, this is not the right adapter."
3,Pretty kinda okay,"The product worked, but I couldn't get the analog sticks to work, which may have been a fault of the game I was playing. :P"
4,"Works well, but consider the game you want to use it for","I don't have much to add to the other reviews, other than that my adapter worked well and let me use my emulator with my old Dual Shock 2. Can't speak for others, but my package included a disc that had all of the drivers needed to make vibration functions work, so no problems there. The reviewers who claim that the nature of the hardware eliminates button sensitivity are correct, the conversion to binary signals means the buttons are either fully on or fully off, and it's doubtful (maybe not impossible) to get around this by fiddling with software. To me, this means that your gaming experience could be affected majorly or hardly at all, just depends on the game you want to use (e.g. Madden will hardly be playable, but something like Bully will be just fine). So, consider how nuanced the control scheme is of the game you'd use this for before you buy."
4,Seems to work,It worked for me. I had to google a bit and find the drivers b/c they didn't come in the box on a cd... (not much of a hassle for paying $3 instead of $14)
1,Useless for DDR,"I purchased this converter for use with a DDR pad on my computer. My friend has the same converter and his works just fine. The adapter I received has a small chip inside covered by appoxy or something and is darker blue than my friend's. No matter what I tried, I could not get my adapter to work with my DDR pad. It would not allow opposite arrows to be pressed at the same time. I tried it with drivers installed and uninstalled and neither worked. When I tried my friend's adapter with the exact same setup, my pad worked fine. If someone knows how to switch it to gamepad mode, it would be great, but I can't figure it out."
3,Usb converter,My only prolem is that i had to search online for the driver for this device instead of it coming with a cd.
1,"Poor quality, droopy","The first thing I noticed was the frayed edges on the lace that were unraveling right out of the package. The hose are indeed quite thin and while I managed not to put a run in them, I can't imagine they would last anywhere near a good pair of L'Eggs. They were a bit hard to get on (imagine putting on your garters with your hose together, good luck getting it straight the first time...!) but, you get used to it. What I would never get used to is that once I sat down to dinner and then stood back up, the garter was now riding halfway down my butt! The host themselves were now down near my knees, with the lace tops well below where a mid-thigh skirt would hit. Nope, these are going in the trash."
5,great,these all came extremely quick. a lot faster than i actually expected. they are good quality and i would buy again.
5,Comfortable.,"I bought these for my partner for a bit of role-reversal and they fit him lovely. Actually, since he is a bit short, the straps were a bit long and the stockings did sag a bit, but they kept their shape. The garter fits female and male hip and waist sizes and do stretch pretty well without ripping. They look and feel quite comfortable and (since I've never worn garters and undergarments without dealing with this issue) they are very easy to pull down when using the restroom. Needless to say, I had to try them on too, and I liked them."
2,Lace garter with stockings,The first time I tried putting on the stockings they ripped. It is a great idea but I had to go back to my panty hose for the evening.
5,Love These,"I've now bought several pairs of these. They're very sheer and do creep down, but they look great, provide great access, and fit well."
1,Worthless,"These are poorly made, cheap stockings. I got a run in the stocking the first time I put them on. And the belt twists up while you wear them. Don't waste your money."
4,This is a solid Bluegrass primer well worth the $$,"It's a good all-around list of tunes played by some greats. Fidelity and clarity are lacking, and you might consider it more for interesting background music than for focused listening. For the price and the songlist, tho', you really can't go wrong if you want to hear hillbilly music (which I happen to like in most forms). I recommend listening to the tracks here on Amazon, first...."
3,Delightful Speeches,"This mix of culture and wisdom makes the perfect addition to any speech for the modern day. No matter if your audience hails from Africa or Russia or even these good ole United States, you can be assured that the words you will use are not offensive and will round out your speech to perfection!"
3,Bulb burned out 1st day,"The bulb burned out the first time I turned it on. I can not find a replacement, and I can't get hold of the company, the phone number doesn't work.Update:Ok I figured out the answer. This comes with a European bulb called an E14. The US standard Candleabra bulb is an E12. Do a Google search for an E14 to E12 adapter. I ordered one for 3 dollars, and now I can use standard bulbs.Besides the bulb issue, the lamp is really cool and well worth fifteen bucks!"
2,"What a neat idea, but-","the item arrived with a broken bulb and I have yet to find a replacement. I have not found a store yet that carries this type of bulb. The store associate was puzzled, as well, he said he doesn't know where I could find one.*update*The Kaito company sent me a new light bulb, which was great, but the lamp still doesn't work. I couldn't get a further response from Kaito. I'm very disappointed, my kids would have loved this. : (I can't recommend this product."
3,good luck finding a replacement bulb,"This lamp is really cool. It has a dimmer, you blow at it to turn it off like a candle, and it has battery or electric, but the replacement bulb is nowhere to be found. No size fits for any standard bulb. Its bigger than a candelabra and smaller than the appliance bulb. So if you want it for a little while and intend to add it to a landfill somewhere, go ahead."
1,Came with a broken bulb,"This product came with a broken bulb, one that cannot be replaced easily since it's a non-standard size. Why they would use such a bulb is beyond me. I would not buy this product for that reason alone."
1,Outdated and unorganized,"This may have been an OK book in 1952, but it has not kept up with the times. Most notably this book is nothing more than a dictionary of terms. There is NO index, NO table of contents and there is NO bibliography for further research.All the terms and abbreviations in this book can be found on the major book listing websites. Plus they are all free. With the majority of information on the web, ABC FOR BOOK COLLECTORS no longer serves its readers. Sorry."
4,good book,I would recommend this book for purchase. Great information to get you started in discovery what your book (s) may be worth.
3,Bigger than I thought...,"Much bigger than I thought it would be. What it loses in Length it makes up for in Depth so it's not as small as one would tend to think. I bought it for my Art Studio, and while it works well, it does take up much more space than you think it will from the picture. So take those measurements and actually SEE how big it is that way before buying...I really wanted something to just heat my coffee up! And this is really for heating a regular Plate of food in my opinion. If I did it again I'd go for a small regular 1.0 cubic black one honestly."
3,Moderately Useful Single,"This single contains 3 tracks: ""Strange Glue"", ""Road Rage (Live)"" and ""That's All Folks""."
5,Fine Inexpensive Headset,"Phones are lite, and the ear pads are probably foam covered withflexible plastic. This suits me better than foam alone. I fine themvery comfortable. Also there is a volume adjustment in the cord. The soundquality seem adequate."
2,Not what I expected.,"I ordered this particular item to use for background music during an upcoming program. Although the historical liner notes are excellent, the sound quality prevented my being able to use the cd."
3,Wrong direction for Wright,"Although I enjoyed this album when it came out in late '77, I found its synthesizer sounds to be too extreme and schmaltzy. Wright always does a good job in terms of writing but his choice of colors seemed limited. If you like vintage synths you may find this to be a piece of ear candy for Moogs and Oberheims. Other than that, Gary's best work was yet to come."
2,NOT what you think,"The book is ok and the songs are good but, what i loved about this show was the mixing of songs which are NOT in this book. It is a book of songs from the original shows. It really should be part of the all sondheim collection of books cause that's all it really is."
2,my 2 fuzzies don't really play with it,"The price is nice but they really don't play with it. I like how each ""spout"" /""bulge"" whatever those things that stick out- each is a different color and makes a different sound! I occasionally hear my one ferret kick it around but it seems like he gets bored with it quick. I have been successful with cheap hard rubber dog toys- it has to be hard rubber so they can't chew it up- they LOVE those kind of toys!"
2,Ferrets Don't Touch It,"Well, maybe it is a personal preference of toy from ferret to ferret, but mine don't touch the thing. It is cute and well made, but they couldn't care less about that part. May work well for other ferrets and animals though..."
2,My ferrets couldn't care less about it.,I just tossed these in their playpen but they really don't care to play with them at all. One of them just decided it was a pillow.
2,you get what you pay for.,"I had to get this because my old batter for my dash lasted for only 12 hours. This one lasts for 18 hours. Better, but not as good as the OEM battery. You get what you pay for."
4,Pretty Good Science Fiction,This is about an alien group that places human souls inside battle droids and how the Rebellion and the weakened Empire team to face the menace. A little lacking in the beginning but excellant in the middle to end parts.
2,Please dont buy this book!,"This book I merely read to know what happened after Return of the Jedi. The book is disappointing, it lacks character development, suspense, or a truly interesting storyline that is the trademark of Star Wars. In addition the true with the Empire is disappointing, unrealistic, and goes against everything the ""rebels"" believe in. In addition the authour leaves us confused at many points with his explanations and its narritive.However I do believe that there are other good Star Wars books, The best I've read is Shadows of the Empire, and Timothy Zahn's blockbuster series. (although the second was a little slow)."
4,A good book for fans of Star Wars,"This book somehow made you feel right at home, continuing right after Return of the Jedi. It had action and suspense, but some of the characters were portrayed somewhat inaccurately. It was an excellent book, overall, though.One small plot flaw:If Wedge Antilles had been celebrating with everyone the night of the Battle of Endor (in ROTJ), how could he be lost in space the morning after, as the book says?"
1,"I had to put the book down, it was too boring!",Kathy Tyers is a terrible writer and I could only read fifty pages into the book! The book was too confusing because of Kathy Tyers lack of telling you where she was talking about!
4,Very good SW book,"This is one of my favorite SW books. It is a little hard to follow and to read, but that just makes it better. The Ssi-ruuk are different, I wish she used a better alien race. But even though I did not realy like the Ssi-ruuk, Kathy Tyers did a very good job on them. The book was a little slow, but realy picked up in about the last 8 or so chapters. I wish Lando could of been in it too. Also, Wedge should have gotten a bigger part."
2,"Complicated names, weak and far out plot","What is this thing with complicated names anyway? I mean, in K.T.'s book names like Ssi-ruuk and Shreeftut, Firwirrung, Manchisco, Ssiruuvi and some other complicated names keep poping up. Why don't writers stick to George Lucas philosophy when writing a book? I mean, how complicated are Luke Skywalker or Han Solo anyway? The book starts weak but takes off on page 100 aprox. It is well writen but names keep making it hard for one to follow the story, like a bad soap opera (Is any soap opera good?)The thing i couldn't stand is this far out stuff about Ssi-ruuks sucking some guy's soul and using it to pilot killer space droids. Get some other S.W. book."
2,Who cares?,"The main problem in this book is that the plot is entirely irrelevant to anything. It has no effect on future conlificts and save for the beginning, doesn't tie into the past... Now, not many women have written Star Wars books but when they do try the plots are hollow and seem too dumbed down... Also, the characters aren't very well developed... The Ssi-ruuk are very cool, I have to admit, but the author didn't really go anywhere with them. All they did was sit around with Dev. There was also way too much description about them. Every single time that it's from Dev's point of view, it restates something about their physical features like their triple-lidded eyes.Also, it's ironic how everything just works out... Pointless ending to a pointless story.This book did make an effort at being good and interesting but it failed. The only saving grace was the Ssi-ruuk but they could have been better portrayed. Nice try."
3,good plot but too slow going!,"When I picked this book up I heard from my friends it was bad so I did not expect much. But they were somewhat misleading.The book starts out great and ends great but is too slow in the middle. It has many creative ideas, gets you involved in the beginning. But in the middle the politics is just too much! It is not interesting when the whole book is about the Imperials and the Rebels trying to work out a truce. It has too much politics and not enough action, though the end almost makes up for it. The space battle was really great and one of the best in any Star Wars novel!Action really is the key in a Star Wars book and it is too bad that it is often lacking here. All in all, this book was ok and was worth my time though there are much better books out there!"
3,A solid Star Wars story,"There have been so many below-par Star Wars books published that I refuse to tear this one up for being merely competent. ""Truce at Bakura"" is a solid story taking place moments after ""Return of the Jedi"" ends and does not make the glaring errors that other authors do. It's not as good as Zahn or Stackpole but I can honestly say that Kathy Tyers is my favorite female Star Wars author.Read this novel before considering the distasteful books by Anderson, Hambly and Jeter."
2,"Story ""Ok"", Writing Style ""Blah""","I'm not going to go into the story/plot, etc... But I will say this... After reading several Star Wars novels, I found it hard to finish this book only because of the writer's style. It was hard to follow who was thinking, who was she flashing to, and the overall choppiness of concepts.Read it for the story, but don't expect a fast, flowing, easy read."
2,Depends on your tastes.,As a hardcore Star Wars fan i couldn't pass up the oppertunity to read about what happens when the movies end. Over all the story was not bad but not authentic. You have to keep in mind this is not what George Lucas said happend after the movies. The story is just someones imagination on paper. If you are like me i would suggest passing on the book and writing down your own thoughts.
2,Ugh....,"I've read a lot of Star Wars novels, and I am a total Star Wars junkie. I've liked, or at least admired, just about everything written to compliment the Star Wars genre, but this ... should never have been written. I can't see how it fits in with Star Wars at all, it's much better suited for Star Trek. I urge everyone to read all Star Wars novels, and that includes this one, but I'd much rather I hadn't bothered. The author captured more or less none of the feeling of Star Wars, and it's blatantly obvious."
2,not very good really,boring. the heroes improbably tossed out into the thick of things after blowing up their second death star. hard to finish this one.
3,Fairly interesting new plot developments.,"If I have to pick one part of this book that I didn't really like, it would have to be that there aren't enough instances where the Force is used. Also, the Ssi-Ruuk are pretty weird and hard to believe. I mean come on, out of nowhere some all-powerful alien race just arrives and threatens the entire galaxy and the New Republic and Empire must join forces to defeat them!? That downplays the movies by making it look like the Empire is weak. But, there are some good points in this book. I won't give them away, just read the book if you are a Star Wars fan."
2,In a word: slow,"Never buy a book about a ""Truce."" I will remember this forever. Kathy Tyers was good at molding her additions to the Star Wars universe, including the awesome Ssi-Ruuk, but she couldn't put pictures in my mind and the story that made use of these features was bland. Worst of all, though, was the boringness of the book. Sure, it picked up around the end (although the action never reached a fever pitch like it should), but I was really struggling through it. The one-day-after-ROTJ didn't seem like a fitting timeframe for these events. Some of the names were also unpronounceable. Slightly below average, but not awful."
3,umm...ok i guess,This is not the greatest SW book ever but it's agood attempt at a follow up from the films. the bit where Vader (sorry Anakin skywalker)'s spirt visits Leia. This is Lukes book though.
3,"Passive book, but let's see you try to write for SW!","I am an all time Star Wars junkie and will read anything I can get my hands on that is titled Star Wars. While Truce at Bakura isn't the best of SW novels, it still is an SW novel!! I say here, here! All you would be writers out there give it a try. I did, and its extremely difficult to write the kind of novel Star Wars truly deserves. I found T at B to be extremely elaborate in detail. Sometimes this helped but most of the time it slowed the pace of the book. I can usually finish a SW novel in about three days if it flows well. This one took two weeks. This reviewer gives it good marks for originality, but not so good for readability. Still if you come away with the basic premise of the story then it was worth the read and will add to your perception of the Star Wars universe.P.S. When are we going to see more of Callista and Luke? END"
5,This book is great!,This book is a great continuance of the Star Wars movies. It was the first Star Wars book that I ever read. I enjoyed the way that it picked up where Return of the Jedi finished.
4,A new take on an old favorite.,"After defeating the Empire, the Rebels face a new and even more dangerous enemy. What really makes ""The Truce at Bakura"" interesting are the alien antagonists and the manner in which they deal with their victims. Tyers also does a good job depicting battle sequences."
2,Worst of the worst!!,"If you're a new reader to the continuation of the Star Wars universe & are overwhelmed by so many books, let me offer some advice: Skip this book!!While not all writer's are going to have a George Lucas-like handle on these characters like Zahn & Anderson does, Tyers has a handle on none of them.Not only that but she's also the worst kind of Star Wars writer - the kind that tries to turn it into hardcore sci-fi & what made Star Wars great was it wasn't sci-fi, it was sci-fantasy."
2,"Weird story, but exciting never the less...","This is a good book for only true Star Wars junkies to read... It suffers from a truly weird plot, and sometimes just doesn't make a lot of sense. I found myself rereading sentences and dissecting dialogue to make any sense of some of the sentences. There is nothing absolutely necessary to read in this book to move along the Star Wars sequel book chain. I just wouldn't reccomend this one, especially to younger readers. And also, the love story was a teaser...If you want to see Luke find a good lover, move on to some books with the Awesome Mara Jade..."
4,Bre's,"This book has all the necessary ingredients for a Star Wars novel. Good plot, good characters. Gaeriel is pretty cool, but I'm glad she and Luke don't end up together. Now, what did I like about this book? The author develops all the characters nicely, and more importantly, realistically. The plot moves along nicely. One problem I did have was the not very well put Leia/Vader issue. That, I think, could have been better resolved. Plus, Luke seems a little too much like his former self (ANH and TESB) than he does his new self (ROTJ). Still, over all, a great read."
3,Definetly not the best,"I have read several star wars book and this one isn't the best. This book focuses mainly around Luke, which isn't all that bad, but you have to pay attention to everyone else. Also, it starts out good and ends good, but it kind of crawls along in the middle. It's not that bad, so I would give it a chance. But I wouldn't be too disappointed if the book isn't what you expect. But the author tried and I give her credit for that."
3,Creative.....but slow this book is.......,"The Ssi-ruuk were creative, but I don't like the fact that this book contained a lot of political scenes that were extremely slow and boring. I did like the end space battle but I don't like the fact that Dev died."
4,"A bit Trekkisch sometimes, but great!","Well here's an author we would like to see writing some more Star Wars novels. Altough the story at some times is a bit like a Star Trek episode, overall it makes a great SW novel. I especially liked the confrontation between Leia and Vader and her problems to accept him as her real father. The movies more or less ignored Leia's feelings about that matter. A great novel, a worthy addition to Star Wars. Snap out of it people! Zahn is really great, but not the only author that can write good SW novels."
3,"Slow starting, but generally not too bad.","The book started off in the first chapter really well with the aftermath of the Battle of Endor from ROJ. Then the book became confusing with these aliens who had strange names, were difficult to picture in your mind, and became annoying to fit in. The storyline goes off on a few tangents and gets hard to understand, but then near the end, it gets a lot better. Generally worth reading if you are a big Star Wars fan, but not recommended for those just starting to get into it."
3,"Good, but could use some more action",Truce at Bakura is a little above average. It could be better. Kathy Tyers could have added in a lot more action.
3,"Good, But Not Great","Tyers has proved that she is very capable of writing a descent Star Wars novel. The book started slow. There was no action, just a bunch af talk about getting Bakura to join the Rebellion. It got better within the last 100 pages which saved from getting 1 star in my review. My advice is not to buy it but look for it in a local library because it is worth the read, but you shouldn't waste your money on it."
3,not bad,"I have to say that I was a little disappionted in this book...and I'm a pretty open-minded person! Maybe it's because I read the Thrawn Trilogy before I read this book, but I did find this book a tad boring! I was also sad that there was not more scenes with leia battling the fact that vader was her father, as i've always been interested in this aspect of her character...some of the characters also seemed a little different. Luke didn't seem quite as mature as we had left him in ROTJ, and he seemed more superhuman than I remember! overall i'd say this book is good and worth the read, but i'd borrow it from the library or something."
1,sucks,"Seemed like the author had seen the first movie and then read synopses of the second and third. The characters were completely wrong, especially Luke, who, though the book is set immediately after the destruction of the second death star, is young and cute and enthusiastically puppy-like, not to mention often the fact that he is often described as being blond. Leia is whiny, Han is a jerk, and it's badly written as well. I'd rather eat it than read it again"
2,Ssi-ruuk make me sick,"Luke has had so many failed relationships like Callista, Teneniel and Leia (but I don't blame that) so go and bring in another one why don't you? The ssi-ruuk and entechment-ugh! Lets not go there!"
2,I've read this one several times and it still makes no sense,"Imagine if Star Wars met the Borg and Brannon Braga wrote it, but for once left out time-travel as the main plot device. He would be completely lost and wouldn't have a clue what to write, and so would probably devise a mess similar to this book. It just doesn't make any sense. At all. Ever. Kind of like a Brannon Braga story."
1,Leave Bakura Alone!!!!!,I found this book entertaining and yet hard to follow at the same time. I usually can imagine the things that happen in these books but with this I couldn't see some of the things that were happening.
5,This was a great novel taking after the Star Wars movies.,"Star Wars: The Truce at Bakura, was the first Star Warsbook I had ever read, and I was amazed. There was action,drama, love, heartbreak, did I mention action? Well, oneday I was pretty bored, and I've always loved Star Wars,so I got this book and once I started I just couldn't put itdown. I was so intrigued by it, that as soon as I finishedwith this one, I went on to buy the next 2 that progressedafter The Truce at Bakura.Now, you may be thinking that Star Wars is old and willbe boring now, but I must say that this is one of the bestbooks I've ever read, and well, I've read a LOT of books.I highly recommend this book to anyone who gets excitedabout Star Wars, science fiction, or just action in general.So, if you like what you hear coming from me, then youwill definitly like what you read coming from Kathy Tyers,in the action packed yet civilized book, Star Wars: TheTruce at Bakura."
4,Da Truce,Good book all around. Picks up right after ROTJ with a good story to start off the EU. If you like star wars pick this book up.
3,"Fair, but not Darksaber material...","I enjoyed reading the book, but I enjoy reading action...this book didn't have much action in it...my favorite star wars book is Darksaber because, it is action packed...I couldn't put it down. All that I wanted to do with the Truce at Bakura was put it down...yawwwnnn."
3,this book would've ruled if...,"everything was taken on a larger scale , hundreds of Rebel and Imperial warships join foces to battle a seemingly invincible foe. The ships in this book were pathetic. everything was done on such a small scale they were laughable. Tyers wasted a great story here. maybe there will be a sequel?"
1,BORING book! Slow all the way,"I was so disapointed with this book, that it pained me to turn the page each time a picked it up. 340 pages of political babble. this is supposed to be GRAND space adventure with characters we already love. a waste of time because the action many have seen on the screen does not happen here. it is mostly talk about diplomacy and alligiance. no action."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The Truce at Bakura is one of the very early Star Wars novels. Just fora change, here we have evil lizard men, who were of course on the sideof The Empire. What else would evil lizard men do?Bakura is a planet in the way of the scaly aliens and their plans for a good healthy game of conquer lots of galaxy.Luke and Leia must therefore go for a trip, and Luke gets a bit of advice from the dead Obi-Wan before setting off."
2,Blech.,"One of the worst Star Wars books I've read. As with so many of the SW novels, the characters are wishy-washy, and plot-wise this one just barely crawls along. Still, A for effort."
1,Wake me up when it's over,"This book was so boring that I had to set the timer on my watch to wake me up every 5 minutes. I would recommend reading a compendium of instruction in underwater basket weaving, rather than try to keep your eyes open reading this book. Or you can try to read it, but do it during the day, right when you wake up, otherwise you won't get past the first 100 pages."
2,I Guess it was ok,"the writing style was good but i never tuley got into the book.However it is a good book to read if your considering reading the entire NJO series because it gives some information about some of the characters and species that are in it.ok so the maine reason why i didnt enjoy it was because it had some anoying characters in it such as Galadrial, who were in it played a part but never really touched anything inside the reader."
2,This book is really SICK!,"This plot was much too weird for a Star Wars story. It was an interesting twist having an alliance between the newly forming Republic and the Empire, but the alien lizard people really spoiled what could otherwise have been a good story. The part about Dev was absolutely pathetic. If you're really interested in good character development - good and evil alike, stick to Zahn's books."
1,This book was so very slowwwwwwwwwwwwww.,Truce at bakura has to be one of the most boring books I've read so far in the star wars universe. The plot took so long to develope and the storytelling did nothing to motivate me in any way to like this book.
5,RIBS,Shipped fast. Can hardly wait for the ice to melt off the grill to try some of these rib recipes.
3,Raichlen on Ribs,"I bought this book to try and expand my knowledge on rib cooking and to get some more recipes to try. While I did learn a couple of things the book really lacks in the recipe department as some are so ""outrageous"" with the ingredients that no one woud try them. I was dissapointed as to the number of quality recipes as it advertised 99 of them. Definitely a begginners book."
4,Excellent Rib recipes,After following the simple recipe in this book I was finally able to make excellent ribs on the Weber charcoal barbecue grill. The only issue I have is in Raichlen's writing style. Some directions are not exacctly in order. I had to read through the recipe a couple of times to get his point for example he tells to mop the ribs then recover the grill for 45 minutes to 1 hr. Then he says mop the ribs again every 45 minutes and replenish the coals if needed. It should read 'Mop the ribs every 15 minutes for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
3,"Sterling Silver 1.2 mm snake chain (14"")",Purchased three of these chains for grandchildren. They are absolutely beautiful but 2 or the 3 chains broke at the point where the chain is joined to the ketch.I would have given these chains with 5 stars but I do not know why the chains failed. (i.e. If grandchildren mishandled or if chains had a poor connection joint.)
1,Poor Quality,"Had this for only a couple of months or so and it's already broken. It only ever received occasional, light wear. The chain snapped clean through. Do not waste your money."
1,3rd Party Gamecube Controller,"As expected for a 3rd party product, the purchased controller lasted 1 day. I personally recommend to obtain an original controller manufactured by nintendo."
3,Beware the Picture,"Beware this product--it's not a bad one, it simply isn't what the picture leads one to believe. I purchased this under the pretense that it was a Gamecube Original part, because that's what the picture shows. However, when I received it, I found it to be a third party knock-off with no badging whatsoever. Buyer beware."
4,gamecube controller,"the only problem with the controller is that the cord is too short,i have had the controller more than a year and it works great , has never broke,my little bro and his friends played and still fine."
4,Good...but joystick loose -__-,"I'm happy that this controller is fully functional and responsive but the joystick is loose and sags. The seller exclaimed it was in ""good condition"" but failed to mention the condition of the most important part of a controller; the sturdiness of the stick. Dont get me wrong though; the controller works great and the stick still functions normally. But, if you're a little OCD and want a sturdy joystick, look for descriptions that clearly state the condition of the stick. I still recommend this product despite the conditon of the product."
4,Works great,"It replaced the controller that had gotten broken. It works well, My grandsons use it a lot. They especially like the vibrations the contrller has when the cars crash."
2,Great controller for playing Wii and Gamecube games if you don't mind the glaring defficencies..,"First off be careful where you get your used controller from. I got mine from Finest Play and from what I can tell, these controllers were all rebuilt fron parts of other controllers that were broken in one form or another. I got one controller that has the orange spice plug at the end instead of the silver plug and the other one had a black plug from the black controller. They are fine functionally but they were in worse condition than avertised. Used very good means that all parts on the contoller match and that they are free from major cosmetic damage. Thankfully I am good with the soldering iron and I got my controllers cord swapped for the spice cord and housing swapped for the one with the black end. Also while I was at it I cleaned all of the grime off of the controllers when I had them dissassembled."
5,An actual review for this item,"The other reviewer seems to think that an item review is the place to rant. I have no idea what he is talking about. I have ordered dozens of items from Amazon and have never had any problems. My orders have always arrived before the expected delivery date.As for the controller, there is no difference between the platinum, black, purple, and orange controllers. I have three GC controllers and they have all stood the test of time. If you don't mind the lack of a rumble feature, the Wavebird wireless controller is the better way to go. I do like the rumble feature so I stick with the corded ones."
3,Excellent controller....short life span.,"I've had my gamecube for about 2 years, and although I have no trouble with the acutal console, I've found that both my controllers now have defective joysticks which tend to stick in one direction all the time. The only buttons that have broken are the L and R ones, which does tend to limit one in certain games. Other than it's short life span, I enjoy using the gamecube controllers more than the X-box and Playstation, it is very comfortable and most of the buttons are in convineant locations(besides the + pad)."
2,Non-official garbage,"After a week of use in heavy play the A and B buttons have sunk in, they still work but they are very loose. Z, L/R triggers are all lacking the feel of an official Nintendo controller. Be aware that when you buy from this seller you will NOT receive an official Nintendo gamecube controller."
2,It acts all crazy after you use it a long time!,"I got my GameCube and this Controller, when I was 4. After 6 years of playing Video Games, the Controller acted all funny and stuff. It was acting weird, like the analog stick I wasn't moving but my character on the screen was walking into wall and boxes, without me moving the stick. I turned off the system and read the Instructions. I did what the Insrtuctions told me to do and everything was fine. Then it happened again in about the first 10 mins., I was playing. It was strange because it was working fine the day before that. So the Controller has like 4-7 years, when it starts acting strange."
4,"Good controller, but there are issues with the Wii","I really don't know if this is specific to our controller or Wii, but sometimes the controller gets into a state where it doesn't work very well and the only thing we can do is unplug/plug it in again. The game we were playing at the time we had a problem was ""Scooby Doo and the Night of 100 Frights"" (great game, btw!).Also, I was very annoyed that the cable is not that long. (Our TV/Wii is about 6 ft from our couch, which in my experience is closer than most I've seen.) We had to purchase an extension (from Amazon) after calling around to all the local game shops, none of which even stocked it."
4,Well shipped,It came much quicker than I expected and I was gaming away with the standard of nintendo's purple wonder within seconds.I know where to come when the rubber falls off like all the others!
1,Counterfeit controller at real deal price.,"This product screams counterfeit. The package is totally generic, the wire is too thin, the body is far too light, and the buttons don't work. Bottom line, this obvious piece of crap is being returned today, and I won't buy from this seller again. Due diligence wasn't taken to ensure a quality product, and I won't reward a business that doesn't even take basic steps for customer satisfaction."
2,Cheap Knock Off,"Cheap knock off...stay away, my mistake is i bought 4 of them thinking they were real. Spend a little more time trying to find real gamecube controllers. They worked, but within the first week the wires started to pull out of the controller."
3,Made in China GameCube controllers,"I purchased two sets of these and have only used two thusfar. So far, so good.They currently work as advertised. Can't say anything bad about them. They don'thave a very good vibration, but it's OK. Thusfar, the buttons work very well, but time willtell. Shipped quickly. Would do business with them again."
3,Don't. Buy. Used.,"I chose three stars because it was a good balance between my first and second tries with this.First try: I ordered a USED controller because it would be cheaper. Left shoulder button didn't work. One star.Second try: Ordered a NEW one. Cost quite a bit more, but worth it in the end. Five stars.Lesson learned: Don't ever buy used electronic hardware online. Just some friendly advice. :)"
4,"gamecube controller, wii","Nothing special, It does just what a gamecube controller supposes to do, cuz it's the offical one. no prob here."
5,Works well,"The item shipped very quickly, works well and what else can I say, I will continue to shop on Amazon as I can always find what I'm looking for at a great price."
3,Kinda awkward but good for Soul Calibur 2! ^_^,"We logged in countless amounts of time, sweat, tears and blood into that game! Animal Crossing and Super Smash Bros. were loved also. Mario Kart: Double Dash was good for multi-player.Overall, it's not that hard to use but I agree the Z button is kinda hard to reach at times. The layout isn't perfect but it's better than some say.3.75 stars."
4,Nintendo knows controllers,"Most of the newer systems I play have the most difficult, congested controllers. Nintendo has never bought into that. A casual gamer needs a controller where the buttons are managable. In the same vein as the Nintendo 64 controller (my all-time favorite), the gamecube controller fits in my hands great and is easy to get used to."
5,The controller!,"When I got a Wii I never though I really needed my Gamecube controllers anymore so I got rid of them. However with Brawl coming out I missed the feel and cushion of Melee's control set up!Without a doubt it's a great buy! Feels great, looks great, plays great."
3,Banjo Christmas Classics...,"It's an odd experience to hear Pete Seeger--with his unrefined, though charming, voice and his trademark banjo accompaniment--belting out ""Lo How a Rose E'er Blooming."" Some of these songs sound gentle and vulnerable; others just don't work as well. It's not a bad album, especially for folk fans, but it's not one I'll keep in the CD player for more than a day out of the Christmas season, either."
1,"I don't sing atheist songs, Pete shouldn't sing Christian ones","Seeger has called himself an atheist all of his life... until recently. It's remarkable how impending death can change one's beliefs. Now he says he ""sees God in all things"". How convenient.Listening to this unrepentant Stalinist singing songs about the birth of Jesus is as galling an experience as I have ever had. Similarly minded communists will buy this album, but only for political reasons.The music is uniformly bland, spare and empty of spirit. One can always hear the echo of the Gulag in every note this villain sings. Skip it if Christmas means anything to you."
3,Regular Guy,"I met William and his wife Rose at a conversational German class. He told us he was an author so I thought I'd try his book. Actually I wasn't expecting much after all he wasn't anyone famous, just a regular guy I knew. I was surprised. The book is remarkably well done. Faced paced and never boring, with some suprising twists. I'm used to reading Stephen King and Nelson DeMille, and Mr. Valtos' writing skills in The Authenticator compares very favorably with those two excellent writers.Hello William, I hope you have a good trip to Europe. Wie Geyts Rose!Mike Lilly"
3,"A bit too big, but nice....","I like this bag, but I don't love it. It's a bit too large to carry around. I only use it when traveling to store more items. For everyday use, I use a smaller, more convenient bag. It has nice compartments and is great for men to carry. But for a woman, I think it's a bit bulky and big."
4,Nice bag,"I registered for this bag becuase it matches my stroller. It is a nice bag, it has plenty of compartments and it came with a changing pad and wipe holder. It fits into the bottom of my stroller but it is big and stiff. It seems more like a mini-cooler to me than a bag. I prefer my soft, flexible, Catini denim diaper bag to this one."
3,Great bag but it is breaking already,I got this bag at my shower. I love it but my daughter is 3 months old and it is ripping on the inside flap. I still love it but I wish it would have a stronger material.
3,Okay,"I thought this bag would fit our needs but the strap is too wide and falls of my shoulders, it doesn't hold the extra items I want to pack like a few toys and an outfit, but the design matches my stroller/carseat and it has insulated bottle compartments on each side of the bag. I use my backpack because when your arms are full it's easier to manage the load. I think a backpack is the way to go but I still have the storage issue. I usually pack six diapers, travel wipes, changing pad, diaper ointment, rattle, stuffed animal, outfit, burp cloth, 1-2 bottles, and some personal items like a checkbook and a wallet. Just doesn't suit my needs."
3,Good for Daycare - Not as great for errands,"This bag works well for Daycare or dropping off at the sitter's, as it is roomy, has great compartments and stands up well. It's easy to ""work out of"", which is nice when it's stationary and someone is grabbing things from it throughout the day. I don't care for it as much though, as a basic bag to take on everyday errands or shopping trips. Not only is it large and bulky (this comment from a big-purse person!), but the handles tore quite easily from the bag - they don't seem to be reinforced quite enough for the size/capacity of the bag. I liked it enough to keep it for Daycare days, but then I carried another bag for my daily, personal use."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A relative of Vitalstatistix's sends his son to him for some toughening up training, as he is a party boy that likes fast cars, not your manly Gaulish warrior types.When some fearless Normans invade on a scientific expedition to discover the meaning of fear, the young lad packs death, but is exactly the man that the Normans want."
3,Those Normans are crazy!,"Rene Goscinny, Asterix and the Normans (Dargaud, 1966)The indomitable Gauls have to face both the Normans, who don't know the meaning of the word ""fear,"" and modernity, in the form of Vitalstatistix' Lutetian nephew Justforkix. Justforkix has been sent to the Gaulish vilage to ""make a man of him;"" what better way than a bunch of rapacious Normans? The usual fun. ***"
3,I really liked the surprise ending.,"A man, probably calling women whose names are in the phone book, finds one who, just divorced, is in need of sexual validation. She learns his game and turns the tables."
5,PLP Flat Panel Adapter Plate,"Should have purchased this adapter right off the bat. It made the installation of our 46"" TV very easy with the Peerless tilt and swivel mount.Includes a variety of common hardware for mounting to the TV. The plate mounts to the bracket, and the vertical arms mount to the TV which easily clip over the plate. Allows some left and right adjustment of the TV to better center it.We've found the Peerless products to be very high quality."
1,Egyptian pop with oriental touch but no musical style,"Don't be fooled into purchasing this album if you are a fan of Algerian Rai. The music is typical of Egyptian pop music and belly dancing rhythmes and isn't one of Hossam Ramzy's best albums. A very redundant collection of tunes taken from various musical styles all over the middle east but specifically from Egypt and Gulf countries. Frankly, I've heard better Egyptian and Arabic music; avoid Egyptian Rai like the plague."
4,upbeat funky and loose,"The moods of each tune are distinct from each other but the overall feel of most of this album is buoyant full-on party time... the rhythms are bouncy and the musicians generally play with a lot of attack.There's also some very tasty improvised solos. For example the aud introduction to track 2 is just sooo soulful. In a nutshell: funky tunes and riffs, a variety of rhythms, moods, and styles, with lots of complexity which is nevertheless easy to listen to and rewards repeated listenings. Sound quality is very good with lots of separation between the instruments without sounding too analytical. In fact the sound is quite gutsy. I loved it."
5,"Wow! A gorgeous, elegant watch!","This is a stunning watch. It is very thin and has a small face. It might look too small if you have very large wrists. But if you have average or smaller wrists, this is absolutely beautiful. It keeps very accurate time. People give compliments on this watch all the time (without knowing that it is a Cartier), and then when they take a closer look and notice that it is a Cartier, they say ""Of course, it's beautiful, it's a Cartier."""
2,Romance without finance is a nuisance,"Trinities is ambitious -- but it falls flat on its face. The characters are not compelling or even particularly believable. Tosches shows off his writing skills, but to what end? The book has no overriding theme. And the Asian characters are all inscrutible Chinese, apparantly beyond the scope of the author's understanding. He does better with the Italian mafiosi, of course, well worn characters from a million other books and movies. a talented writer, obviously, but the book's a dud."
3,An Interesting Experiment,"I don't know enough about the 17th century to know how accurately King Christian IV is drawn, but he does manage to keep the reader interested - he's real enough. In a novel with many narrators and not very much interaction among them, some characters come across as ""someone"" and some do not. It was basically an attractive idea: to make the telling of the tales an ensemble of various ""instruments"". And all in all, it's quite pleasant. It's just not very deep. As usually happens, the ""evil"" characters are more interesting than the ""good"". Many seemed derived from literature rather than life or history, which I would imagine is a great hazard in historical novels. Are they all so superficial though?In any event, it is a superb title."
5,review by Helen Falla,"An 'epic novel' in that the author leaps about from period to period, place to place, and family to family. As soon as the reader becomes engrossed in one scenario, he is abruptly shifted to another. While this is initially annoying, the author manages to retain one's attention as she unscrambles and reconnects all the various histories. So well written that quite fantastic events and people become completely credible. Very difficlut to put aside, and the characters remain with one for a while."
4,Characters in Pursuit of Harmony,"Tremain plays with opposites and contrasts, point and counter-point. Intertwoven tales are composed of yearning and loathing, the magical and the mundane, expectation and dread, youth and age, imaginings and realities, miraculous and carnal -- the very stuff of life and death. The book is large, sometimes bawdy, often hilarious. Each character pursues his or her version of harmony. In one of the most striking and ironic demonstrations of power and creativity, Christian IV seems to have brought forth the music he adores from the stone floor of a palace state room. How has he produced this wonder? Dispatched to the cold, almost lightless wine cellar beneath, the orchestra plays the music they must, glorious sound that is conveyed to state room and ears by the King's cunningly engineered system of pipes and grates and ducts."
2,Music and silence-just a romantic romp?,"Having just finished what i believed to be a book focusing on music in history with perhaps a bit of romance thrown in, i was disappointed to find a book in which the musician whom we are led to believe is to be our hero, is instead given only passing treatment as indeed is anything musical. In addition to this, tremain sees fit to transpose not only modern language but also attitudes onto her characters, especially those who are female. Surely if she wished to write about such characters it would have saved her a great deal of trouble simply to place the book in a more modern context instead?"
3,Who ever thought of comparing it to Hamlet?,"A so-so book with spots of pretentious writing and an array of characters who never quite seem wholesome. It is not a page-turner which strikes with the depths of its characters or the crispness of descriptions; rather a somewhat boring narrative about people and their ordinary desires, lusts, yearnings, etc."
5,Best Beans EVAH!!!,These are the best beans I have ever had. I like to put a little bit of oil in a sauce pan first. Then add these beans and stir until combined. They are DELICIOUS!!!!
2,Boring,"Tedious, surprisingly joyless tome on Christmas. Not a ""history of"" exactly, more like an investigation into certain aspects of it. An entire chapter on wrapping paper, another on store displays. Yes, it's thoroughly researched, but there is a limit to how much a casual reader wants to know about things like this. I got through 3 chapters before I starting skimming, rather than reading it. A few interesting nuggets but no more than that. Choose a different book."
1,Look at it before buying,"If I had browsed through this book before buying it, I would have rejected it for these reasons: content is superficial, author's tone is smarty-pants academic as well as wordy,and the illustrations are poorly reproduced."
3,Merry Christmas: Celebrating Americas Greatest Holiday,A very informative and fun book about Christmas. Too few pictures to suit me but loved it none-the-less.
4,Good value but not for the discerning palate,"As mentioned by another reviewer, this did not arrive vacuum packed and I suspect this item may have been older stock. Grinds into a decent cup of coffee but not one to savor. Perhaps I am a bit jaded having been recently spoiled with several pounds of rich full bodied coffee beans.I give this the benefit of the doubt and 4-stars. Although bland, it is drinkable and not overly acidic. The most important factor for me, is that I got a great price for this."
3,Packing,"In this order, The coffee beans were not vacuum packed which is the usual condition that I receive them in prior orders."
2,Not what I was expected,"If you like Ricky Martin's music, don't expect this DVD is going to fill your needs. Music and production quality is poor. Seems that it was made by a low budget producer.All songs are in spanish, so if you expect to see a live performance of Living la vida loca, you'll be upset.Although I am one of his country fellowmen, I have to rate this DVD less than average....POOR!Sorry, this is my honest opinion."
5,Fantastic Insider View of Ricky on Tour!,This was an excellent DVD - fantastic footage of Ricky as life on tour really is. I loved the fascinating inside look at Ricky and touring in Europe. The style and perspective of the filming is wonderful - a much needed break from the overly boring and commercialized alternatives!
5,Works as intended,"I use this to connect the hotshoe version of the lastolite 28"" softbox to my Elinchrom 600RX. It works perfectly and holds the softbox very tightly. The one concern with the hotshoe version of the softbox is that the hole is very small and gets awfully close to the flash tube. It doen't touch, but there is probably an average of half a centimeter distance around.This must be placed on the softbox first, then mounted onto the flash. I'm sure if you try you can put the softbox on after, but it would be tough."
2,Not fitted well,"Sadly, this products missed the correct measurement. It is not even same in size with the Elinchrom original adapter. If it is available and shipped with a rubber on edges, so the diameter size will be bigger and fitted perfectly."
5,Yummy Cookbook!,"This book is filled with wonderful recipes. The Chocolate Chip Pudding Cookies are one of our favorites. Well, the Cheesecake Cookies are delicious too, its hard to pick a favorite. Each recipe is easy to follow and made with simple ingredients. The art work is fun too. The author put time and heart into this cookbooklet. Enjoy!"
2,Takes too long to get started,"I almost didn't make it through this book (and that's unusual for me). It was obvious the author was building up to something right from page one, but the thing never got going until 7/8 of the way through! Then the final 1/8 all zipped by in a way that seemed way too easy and convenient and not worth all the buildup.On the bright side, the narrator was a fun sort of character, a spunky girl with a history of trouble and an attitude that never quit. A good character lost in a mediocre, slow-moving plot."
1,Why not the real McCoy?,"As another reviewer noted, this is NOT the music used at the games! Why couldn't they put together a CD with the music used at the opening and closing ceremonies? Why not a DVD of those ceremonies (this time WITHOUT NBC's annoying commentary and constant commercial interruption!)? Those ceremonies, as are all Olympic Ceremonies, are carefully choreographed and usually magnificent occasions worthy of preservation on DVD. Somehow, it all just gets trashed and forgotten. After the tremendous expense involved, that seems incredibly wasteful. The drum beats at the beginning of the opening ceremony sent chills down my spine! Oh, to see and hear them again!We can hear these dumb pop stars anytime. This CD is a pathetic peice of self-promotion. Avoid it."
1,Why is this an Olympic authorised CD??,"After visiting Athens during the Olympics and attending many of the events I eagerly looked forward to a CD being released of all the music played at the venues to keep the crowd going. Unfortunately ""Unity"" is the CD they released. Of all the songs on this CD I recognise about 3 that were actually played in stadiums during the Olympic Games - so why is this the official Athens 2004 CD?"
3,caveat emptor,"what a terrific deal i got at BIG LOTS, I ONLY PAID $4.00 FOR THIS DVD SET.BRAND NEW!!!!"
5,Gorgeous sweater!,This is a grogeous sweater. I am always impressed with Harold's quality and this is exactly what they sell in the store. You will not be disappointed with this one.
3,Not that great,It was not that great. I have read better books than this one. I didn't like the heroine. I like Clint.
4,Is there a Doctor in the house?,"Now I understand that Dr. Marten's shoes have become more of a fashion thing than anything else... but why don't they make these in wide toe sizes?I have been wearing Doc's for about 15 years... but now my ""feet"" are getting all screwy and I need a wider shoe. I tried these shoes because they looked wide based on pictures... but they ended up a little too snug. If they were just a little wider they'd have been perfect. And I've sent other shoes back for the same reason.I wish I could have worn these shoes because they seems incredibly well made... but it just wasn't in the cards.I give it 4 stars... 5 would have been if I could have kept them."
1,Diamond LED blown,"I used this Luxeon bulb in a 4 cell Maglite. The light was clear white and bright. However, after first time using it for about 30 minutes, it literally burned and clouded the bulb chamber. Not sure about this bulb's reliability."
2,messy EC-505,"I find that this unit spatters and sputters terribly when I make quantities of rice measuring 3 cups dry or more. It is a 10 cup cooked unit and I can't imagine making any larger quantities than I have. I use the right amount of rice and water. Water spills over onto my countertop and through the air hole. As it nears being done the liquid spatters out the air hole all over my countertop. What a mess! I threw away the packing materials or I would probably return it. I do like the non-stick pot and the keep warm feature. If anyone has any advice on how to keep this mess from happening, I would appreciate it!"
1,"basic cooker, poorly made","I bought this cooker last year in May 2009. It is now April 2010 and in less than a year the non-stick coating has peeled off rendering this machine unusable. I called the manufacturer and they were beyond unhelpful. They first claimed that the cooker was discontinued. Then when I asked why it was still being sold on their website, the customer service rep said they would replace the part if I had the store receipt which I no longer have or I could just buy a new one. For $25 one can buy a basic rice cooker from other manufacturers. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Dvr 510,The DVR works fine but there was no instruction manual. Also when I registered the Receiver I had to pay $33.00 to Dishnetwork because that amount was still owed to them by the previous ownerGJ Hedenkamp
2,Don't buy used,"This review is not about the subject of the tape. It is about the quality of the tape. I purchased a used tape that was listed as ""near new"" The video is bad and the audio is worse. I have several tapes purchased from the Bob Ross website that are professional grade. I cannot tell if this tape has been played too many times or if it is a duplicate made on a poor quality machine. I reccomend buying a new tape or CD. The savings of buying a used one does not compensate for the disappointment."
3,Read it and make a few hours 'Vanish',"This is the second 'Rizzoli/Isles' book I've read...but the first one must not have been very memorable, since I quickly forgot it! This one stands out a bit more, anyway. A 'change of pace' thriller, which takes Rizzoli out of her usual 'street crime/serial killer' element, and endangers the lives of her entire family. The 'crooked defense contractor' and 'Russian prositute' angles are not exactly original, but at least Gerritsen manages to make them seem less cloying than other authors might have. I do prefer 'cop dramas' to be just that, and stay away from the convenient 'terrorism and in-fighting government agencies' stories that have proliferated in crime fiction since 9-11.Maura seems like too much of a background character, as Jane and Gabriel get most of the action. Mila manages to rise above the cardboard cutouts of the other prostitutes, making this an above-average read."
3,Beyond the medical thriller,"After making her mark in the medical thriller realm, Gerritsen expands her reach into the realm of standard police procedurals with ""Vanish."" In typical Gerritsen style, the prose flows smoothly, the characters are richly drawn, and more than one woman loses her life in support of the plot line.Speaking of plot, the conspiracy theory seemed a little far-fetched to me, and the loose threads left at the end of the book kept this from being a four-star review. But lovers of Gerritsen's medical thrillers will enjoy the return of old favorites like Isley and Rizzoli, and fans of conspiracy theories will enjoy seeing the government guys turn out to be the bad guys -- and get their just rewards."
5,Excellent!,"This is definitely one of the best novels I've read from Ms Gerritsen. After reading the first chapter I knew I was settling in for an entertaining, suspenseful, page turning ride. The horrors that the innocents had to endure was hard for me to imagine, but heartrendering just the same. Such cruelty. It felt good to see some good come from all they'd endured. A very satisfying ending to a novel I've recommended. Great job Ms Gerritsen."
5,Awesome author!,"I love every book written by this author so far ! I usually only read non-fiction, but I stumbled upon one of her books one time and couldn't put it down. I've been hooked since ! And ""Vanish"" does not disappoint !"
5,Vanish,"Tess Gerritsen keeps you enthralled from the beginning and, in this book, highlights the reality of the Russian sex trade."
2,Dull in parts,Poor enough by Tess G standards. Tries hard to create a tense episode in the hospital but it didn't work...was boring instead! Disappointing as I like this series.
1,"a good tale, but very unrealistic","I usually love Tess Gerritsen's work. This one fell short for me in several ways. I am to believe that a one week past her due date a female police officer would wrestle a hostile defendant to the ground in court. Also that she would continually place her unborn child, herself, and then her newborn infant in critical danger, to the point of digging both their graves at gunpoint. I speak from experience, police work being my chosen profession during both my children's births. No matter the amount of dedication, no woman would behave in this way. Jane Rizzolli should lock herself up for child endangerment."
2,Had to force myself to finish this,"I just finished listening to the audiobook version of this - really had to force myself to finish it. This is the second book of Ms Gerritsen's that I've tried; I couldn't get through the tedium of the first one, but thought I'd give another shot since so many people seem to really enjoy her novels.I found this story to have way too much ""filler"" talking about the main character's home life - trouble breast feeding the new baby, trouble deciding on a name, on and on.Added to that the fact that the story was just way too full of coincidences, and not much suspense at all, I really don't think I'll be trying any more from this author."
4,Action Filled,"Vanish is a fast paced mystery with a new intrigue after each page turn. A nine month pregnant homicide detective, a ME whose corpse wakes up on the table, a FBI agent whose pregnant wife is held captive; what more does a story need? Even with all this action, Gerritsen makes certain it all seasoned with bits of humor.The author weaves fantastic but believable action onto every page. Her character development is complete enough to make the reader feel as though they have known them all their lives. A recommended read."
2,Not her best,"She's been one of my favorite authors, turning out 1 great read after another. One of her most memorable books was ""Gravity"" which I read til dawn despite needing to go to work next morning.However, ""Vanish"" is not on of those books. The story/premise, which I will not reveal is quite boring/run of the mill. I don't really mind that Detective Rizzo makes another appearance, but I do object when authors devote more of the book to the old characters than to the story. Hello, these are supposed to be thrillers and not drama books. I do not really need to know that much about Rizzo and her family. Incidentally, that is what has made the TV series Law and Order a hit, concentration on the story and not the characters. Still, this book is easy reading and easy to follow, but not one that will make me Say Wha? at work the next day."
4,Tess Gerrisen is becoming one of my favorite authors,"Suspense and a little social justice makes for a good read. I know people who did not like this book, and I'm not sure why. It's a page-turning read, and the characters (as usual) are always well-developed. I recommend this book, but if you're going to read the Rizzoli series, start with Book 1. They're all awesome."
4,easy excitement,"At times I couldn't put this book down. It was very exciting, very cookie cutter. The story and plot were well-developed. I felt like the ending was very rushed into..and the books were ok as far as character development..,you end up not caring very much what happens to the characters."
4,Maura without Jane,"I have not finished the book yet, but far enough that it's coming together. A very different book for Tess Gerristen. I have read many. It's a good read."
5,vanish by tess gerritson,"As always, Tess Gerritson has come through with another great book. The characters and plot are detailed and interesting, with many twists and turns."
1,Amazingly tedious,"The plot is painfully predictable. The subject -- while one that I wish was more commonly recognized -- is treated with kid gloves on one hand and moaning mournful weeping and guilt-ridden pity on the other. The characters are plastic. The conspiracy is not believable. The action drags especially through the second half, when one might think suspense (""or something"") might be happening. I would rather rub cheese graters on my genitals than read this again."
4,fast paced thriller that questions everything,"A young police investigator and her husband are confronted by some frightening possibilities when a hostage situation involves them in what may be a deadly cover-up. Two suspects in the hostage situation turn out to be nearly unidentifiable. Their finger prints and background are either non-existent or have been erased. As their investigation leads to a murder scene of five women, the evidence seems to become more and more muddled and the people that they can trust grows smaller and smaller. Evidence disappears, phone lines are not secure and the wrong people keep showing up at inopportune times. There may be one person who holds the key to what happened but all they have is a first name and a possible code,""The die is cast."" All of their lives are in jeopardy because whoever is behind the cover-up is desperate and has everything to loose. Vanish is a fast paced thriller that questions everything."
3,Vanish,"Gerritsen is a prolific and popular author and has written several books in the Rizzoli and Isles series of which I've read three but not in sequence. The series features Jane Rizzoli, a police detective, and Maura Isles, a medical examiner who have a work relationship and are close friends. In this book Isles discovers a body of a woman in the morgue who isn't dead and the same woman later shoots a security guard in the hospital and takes hostages. One of the hostages is a very pregnant Jane Rizzoli who is in the hospital for tests. Also featured in the book is Jane's new husband, Gabriel Dean, an FBI agent. The plot involves young Russian women brought to the States on promises of good jobs who are forced into prostitution/white slavery. The book was hard to get into, slow going through the middle, but it picked up at the end. The plot was improbable, but overall it was a interesting read on a snowy winter day."
1,"Not an official controller, broke after a week.","I purchased this because it said in the description that it was an official Nintendo controller, it is not. It does, however, look exactly like the official Nintendo controller so I figured there wouldn't be much difference, but boy was I wrong.After a week the C stick would stick, meaning you would have to manually center it when not using it. The Z button also stuck, and I have yet to be able to to fix this... so when I play games with this controller it plays like the Z-button is constantly being held down.Do not buy this, and I suspect many of the other GameCube controller deals online are similar to this. I'd recommend just going to the store and making sure you get an official Nintendo product, or even a quality 3rd party controller."
3,"Fun, but not reliabul","a nise Spice Orange gc controler but, unforcheitley, it broke in a month.Frst the a buten was ifiy, then it broke"
2,Poorly Made,"I just bought this Controller about 3 days ago, Brand New and the Thumb Stick stop working on it I can only use Left and Right.. This controller also is not a Real Brand Nintendo controller buyers beware of after market brands"
2,very misleading,"this item was listed as ""like new"" but it is ""acceptable"" at best. the first thing that i noticed was that the seam had a large amount of dark buildup, which tells me that someone has used the controller extensively. there are scuffs and dents all over the controller as well as some sticky residue that i will have to clean off before i will even be able to use it. further inspection shows the cord is kinked, appears to be twisted inside, and has something (rust?) on the connector. there is something rattling around on the inside and the joystick is looser than the used one i picked up at a disc replay. im debating whether or not i should even put in the work to try to clean this controller up and see if it even works or just return it.TL;DR i am very disappointed with this purchase. what was advertised as a ""like new"" controller was really an old used and abused one that someone tossed aside."
3,"Not a First-party controller as description suggests, but works","Despite the pictures showing a controller emblazoned with a Nintendo logo and the ""By Nintendo"" in the manufacturer info space, this is not a first-party controller.Both of the sellers I purchased controllers from sent me the same aftermarket third-party controllers.The good news is that these third-party controllers are (knock on wood) performing very well.My previous experience with third-party controllers is that they either don't work, or that they work for about a week.My major gripe is that the attached cord is extremely short. I would recommend an extension cord unless you habitually sit that close to your TV.Caveat emptor--it would seem that if a product is similar enough to the one you see in the picture, Amazon.com just considers it to be the same product.The third-party controller does look very similar; it just is not the same.It should be more than good enough for most applications, and I'm fairly picky."
1,Not Nintendo Product,"Buyer Beware! This is not a Nintendo product--even though it says that it is on Amazon. The package doesn't say ""Nintendo"" anywhere! I bought these from two different sellers--none was a Nintendo product. I agree with the other customer who said that the controls are unresponsive. I bought another off-brand controller at Wal-Mart--it cost a lot more ($20),but it is much more responsive. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Useless for cat urine,Bought this because the cat peed on the cough while I was out of town.Smell lingered after repeated applications.
1,Bigoted rubbish,This book features the stereotypical portrayal of gypsies as conniving to kidnap and sell trusting children. It was written in 1921 and fortunately awareness has improved since then. The only reason to read this book is for a sociological study on outdated social attitudes.
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"Caroline returns to England after ~4 years away. Her cousin's company is having serious problems. She is confronted by a former lover, Matt, whom appears to be seeking revenge by destroying the company. Through a series of flashbacks, the reader learns of the lovers past history. Presently, Matt extracts payback via a rather unorthodox manner. To save her cousin, she must agree to Matt's terms, while withholding a vital secret.Although ""Harlequin Presents"" novels tend to be rather short, predictable, & often underdeveloped, I found this novel to be very engrossing. It is a sweet love story about dissolution, pain, love & understanding. Enjoy!"
5,The Ministry of Motherhood,I attended a homeschool retreat last weekend and this book was suggested as an absolute for reading. I cannot wait until I have a copy in my hands. Sally Clarkson has the leading edge on encouragement for homeschooling your child/ren. Praise God for her and her husband Clay's ministry.
4,Kindle edition,Awesome book! I'm very glad to see that they removed the Kindle format for this though because it was terrible. Unfortunately I can't return it.The book itself is highly recommended but I think that Random House should be ashamed of selling this poorly copied book at a higher price than the paperback. There is no excuse for the extreme amount of typo's and missing page.
5,Great book,This book will both encourage and inspire you. I did the study with a group of moms and it forever changed my ideas as a mom.
1,"Heartbreakingly, not the book I thought it would be...","I was so incredibly excited to order this highly recommended book, but it crossed the line into self-promotion from the very beginning. I swallowed that and pressed on, hoping to get absorbed in the ""meat"" of the text. Later in the book, I struck a theological stumbling block about Peter that made me put it down, later placing it in the trash."
4,Great Book,I'm really enjoying this book. It goes a little deeper than most parenting books. I think it's a great book for Christian Mothers.
5,Great Book,"Great book which really encourages mothers in new ways. It provided me opportunities to do things I had never thought of, deepening my relationship with each of my children."
4,a book to read and shared,What a wonderful book. I had a hard time closing the cover and giving myself time to mull over everything Sally had to say. I will definitely be pinching a few more pennies to purchase a few more of her books. A must read for every Christian Mother.
3,Blood-sucking corporations turn literally into blood-sucking,"A fun idea, but the obvious rush in production mars this film. Some vaguely familiar actors, but the unknown cast in the lesser role of side-kick should have been put in the lead- at least he seemed to understand that this film (as written) would only work as a comedy."
3,"sadly, i had to return it.","the sterling silver chain turned blackish within weeks after wearing it. i was surprised because i've used sabrina silver before and i've always been happy with them. well, the good news is that i received a prompt refund."
4,necklace...,"Just received this chain yesterday and I like it.It came quickly and was 2 days ahead of deliv sked.It has a nice shine to it, and is comfortable.I got it for a small white gold cross pendant and they go togetherpretty nicely.It's an all-around nice necklace and a good general thickness at 1.5mm.I'd buy it again."
1,I'd give it less than a one star but it's not a choice,"The first half of this book is spent describing the boring life of the main character, Jody Whatever the hell her last name is.The story never leads anywhere. It simply revolves around this woman who's life is no more interesting than that of a paper weight.I had to quit reading it halfway through because it was so silly and never lead up to anything.Throughout the book, the writer kept yanking new characters and embedding them into the story without giving the reader who they were and where the hell they came from. A waste of time."
4,Location shots of places referenced in the study of English literature,"Every person that grows up in the English-speaking world is exposed to some of the great literature written in the language. While it only does a little to increase the understanding of a piece of literature, it is still interesting to see a ""location shot"" of the place where the literature was written or where the story takes place.This book is a collection of photos with brief descriptions of the item of English literature associated with the location. While it is necessary for the reader to have some familiarity with the item being referenced if they are to completely understand it, some understanding is possible even if there is no familiarity."
1,worst product,"don't buy. It ia a piece of junk. I could not use it for cooking rice. Since then, I used it for steaming, boiling water. Other than that it is useless"
1,Hopeless,Please do not buy this product.I opened the package and switched it on and it did not work.
5,"""I Spy"" fun!","Great pictures and fun humor for all ages. We enjoy this ""Where's Waldo"" kind of format. It's a good quiet time activity."
2,not so swell,"bolts loosen while using. not very sturdy, maybe ok for lite home use by teens. easy to assembe and looks commercial, shipping was fast"
2,drag racing funny cars of the 1970s,"This book has nothing to brag about,all photos are black and white,and quality isn't that great.Pretty good tidbits of information,but not much.It will be a letdown If you are expecting modern day quality for photos."
2,Belly Dancing for Beginners,The Dvd was not at all what I expected. It shows all of the hand movents. But nothing on hip movements and feet placement or steps.
5,Erotic Excellence,"Teleny is undoubtably the finest example of an erotic novel that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It flows smoothly and easily throughout the plot without becoming redundant or boring. The passion and conflicting emotions portrayed in these men are both riveting and timeless. I particularly enjoyed the subtle way in which sex and death, the two great constants, were so skillfully entertwined. The permanence of death serves to highlight the immediacy of our need to live life to the fullest extent. This is not a creampuff romance. It is a story of a passionate driving need to reach out and touch another human soul."
4,waiting to be noticed,"Lisa Linn Kanae presents not just a book but stylistically pleasing work of graphic art to frame the story of Pidgin (Hawaiian Creole English) speakers in Hawaii. It's as if the differences between a conventional book and Sista Tongue are a parallel to the differences between standard English and Pidgin. Although there is no overt unifying theme, and only one narrative arc (about the author's brother Harold), Sista Tongue eloquently and uniquely encapsulates the effort of a group of marginalized people to maintain their identity, despite being stigmatized for their unconventional speech, even being labeled as mentally ill-equipped."
5,From sweet boys to handsome men.....,"I have been following The Moffatts for about 5 years now. I have watched their music progress from country crooning to a heavy rock/pop influence. Listening to songs like ""Misery"", ""Written All Over My Heart"", and ""Wild At Heart"", there will be no doubt in your mind that this is the kind of music that the boys were born to make. Combined with powerful ballads such as ""Love"" and ""Miss You Like Crazy"", this album will keep you listening for hours."
5,This is a great cd!,"It has 13 great songs of non stop beat and groove. My favorite song is ""I'll Be There For You"". It has a great melody. I also really like ""Miss You Like Crazy"". I highly recommend this cd, because its great."
5,The moffatts are totally way kool!Great vocals&lyrics!,"I promise 'ya,if you don't buy this album,you'll have to wake up!The Moffatt's aren't like Hasnson& all those other bands!They are totally kool!They've got real vocal harmony and terrificccc lyrics!Not to mention that Scottand Bobare totally so cute!"
5,THE ALBUM IS AWSOME!!!!!!!,"At first, i thought the moffatts are just hanson-wannabees! but i realized that....THEY REALLY ROCK ON !!! THEY ARE DEFINITELY BETTER THAN HANSON! so i'm telling u guys that this album is really awesome and it's worth to listen to it !!!! grab a copy now!! ROCK ON!!!"
1,I was disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this album! I excpected more! I saw them on Much Music and I think they need to find their own identity! They seem to be copying all the other successful so called ""boy bands"". They need their own thing! Their lyrics were really lacking also. They need to expand more and not just repeat the chorus over and over!"
4,Just to clear some stuff up.....,"Hey, yo, peoples! Just to clear some stuff up.....both The Moffatts & Hanson write their own music. And yeah, there are some similarities between the two - they're both family bands, they both write & play their own music, and their musical styles are similar - but The Moffatts started out doing country, & Hanson started out doing pretty much the same kind of stuff they do now. Both bands are extremely talented, though. Their music just makes you happy! The first time I heard ""Until You Loved Me"", I smiled for the rest of the day!"
1,Um..can I say..Hanson Wannabes?,Ok well lets see I* will give the Moffats 1 start for playing their music..other than that..I dont care for them. For people who say hanson hasnt been around longer..WRONG! Hanson has been doing music their whole life! Duh! And..I think theykinda of changed to pop from country right after they saw Hanson taking the world by storm..if they are so populer why is that I have only heard their song once and that wasin april and its august! Andmy friends heard they asked me if it was hansons news song..They said I hope not hanson can do better than that! So..well they cant rock like hanson I saw them in concert lets say..they dont get you pumped.--Tara
1,I hate The Moffatts.,I hate them soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo very very very very very very very very very very very much.
3,A bit disappointing,"I arrived at this book when searching for who's responsible for that splendid clear, simple style of writing of Readers' Digest. As I could not find a Readers'Digest writers handbook, I searched for who worked there, and found some reference to the author of this book. It is a good book, teaches you style and composition and is a good source for professional writers, but is not what I was initially looking for."
2,not seamless,was not happy w this bra . the inside of the cup did have a seam and it was not comfotable.
2,Ehh.. so so.,"I wore it once and never wore it again. It makes my ""girls"" look pokey and weird. And it was a bit small."
3,funny shape,"It's not bad for the price but it is a different cup shape then my other bras that look just like this one. I thought I was buying the same bra. It is a bit pointy if that makes any sense. I believe another reviewer said it made the ""girls"" look funny. I would agree but not to an extreme. I'm going to wear it when I work out because for the price that's still a great deal and then I won't have to wash my nicer bras as often."
5,Useful book,"I bought this ""Time Out"" Book along with ""Lonely Planet"" copy of Dubai. I found the ""Time Out"" issue to be very informative with suggestions of hotels, nightlife bar/club, restaurants, entertainment for kids and adults, maps and cultural life. I couldn't put the book down since it covered alot of interesting short reads. I reccommend this book as a start for a quickie read and to take along with you as a guide when you visit Dubai. I thought it was worth the buy and there is very little guide books of Dubai. Also, the ""Lonely Planet"" book covers the same information as ""Time Out"" but less interesting but focus more of History,tourist sites, and culture."
2,Not what I expected,"I received the arm and had it installed. The individual that installed it said it was the most non-user friendly mount that he has ever installed. I have a 42 inch LCD hooked up to it, and it is virtually impossible to move without wrenching it hard enough to be worried about ripping the tv off of the mount. I would not buy.."
5,I love my 929rr,"Its true this book pales compared to the one devoted to the GSX-R. I have that one too, and it contains lots more content and inside information ..which is to be expected as it was a factory backed undertaking. This Fireblade book comes off as a very decent encapsulation, though quite 'old' when you consider all that has Honda-happened since the 929 and the 954. Five stars if you own one of the older bikes. Owners of the true 1000cc bikes should probably pass. Nothing for you here."
4,"Once again, great B-sides!","Like the four other songs that didn't make the U.S. version of the new album, this single includes two non-album tracks that are better than most songs on the ""The Cure"". Goes to show you that the record company obviously exerted great influence on the band to release an album that never took REAL fans into account one iota. Via the singles or import albums, check out the other songs from these sessions (Going Nowhere, Truth Goodness and Beauty, This Morning and Fake) to see what I mean. All are Classic Cure: mid-tempo, melodic, and not out of place on anything from Disintegration to Wish to Bloodflowers. And NOT designed to sell albums to fans of fukking Interpol!"
4,Check your headroom!,"This film was definitely unlike anything I have ever viewed before. While it's wild visuals and uncanny dialog kept my full attention, the music (all written by Evet Socrates) was amazing. As Evet makes his film debut with Astrolux, I can't wait to see what other stunning works he puts forth in the future!"
3,Did George Carlin Walk-The-Talk?,"I admired George Carlin for his entire career. A lot of us changed right along with George. Now I am looking for something that will tell me if George was for-real or was the original Michael Moore. I enjoyed scanning this short bio...but it didn't answer my question. However, it may be an indication of just how little George revealed himself to others. For example, why hasn't some ""close friend"" published the killer George Carlin Bio???"
5,Mister Rogers Songbook (Songs for Kids) product review,"The songbook came very quickly as I waited with baited breathe for it! It arrived in mint condition, as was promised on Amazon! I am very pleased to have it and look forward to playing and singing the songs for and with my grandson, who is 3 yrs. old!"
2,Disappointed,"The absence of many of the songs I think of as MisteRogers standards disappoints me. Give me the like of ""Everybody's fancy,"" please."
4,A Good Party Game For The Wii,"After having Wario Smooth for several months (which never really impressed me and is on the shelf collecting dust), this game is a great addition to the Wii family. Although there are some flaws which really aren't big enough to get into, everyone in the family enjoyed playing this game the most on Christmas day. The gameboard really adds to the game and the minigames are great. If you already have Super Mario Galaxy and are looking for another game the family can play, I would recommend this game. Also, the DS version of the game is fun to play."
1,Mario Party 8,"Never having played the previous 7 Mario Parties nor having known a single thing about the game itself other than its a 4 player game with mini- challenges of skill, I was expecting something a little more entertaining. Its perfect for kids age 4-9 maybe but as far as adults, not so much. The graphics are overly colourful and showy. The gameplay is painfully boring. The video that Nintendo is showing of people still on thier couch and watching the screen... pretty much sums up the game. You sit and wait for the graphics to animate on and off then after a few minutes you can stand up and actually do something. Then back to sitting. Its basically a board game with very few and far between moments of action."
2,"Very disappointed, especially after such a long wait!","As a Gamecube owner who has every one of the Mario series games Nintendo has made, all I can say is that Mario Party 8 for Wii has been a big let down. Party 8 seems more like a demo disc of half baked games than a premium game disc that sells for $50. The games played out more like silly and tedious board games and basically gave me a headache."
1,Not worth anyones time,"This game isn't even worth anyones time or money. I excitedly waited for this game for my birthday to only find out I can unlock the games within 3 hours of gameplay and that most of the games did not utilize the wii remote sensory and advises people to use it as a simple joystick. Also, most of the games and stages are ripoff's of previous mario party games. Even worst is that the computers in the game roll straight 10's or they land on event buttons time after time, even on easy. The fun and challenges once present in mario party is completely lost in this game, especially in the once terrifying duel battles, which doesn't challenge the player nor is anything lost in the end that you couldn't get back within 2 or 3 turns. Buy this game if you want something you can beat a 3 hours and torture your friends with, otherwise don't waste your time. Theirs much better games to play out there."
1,Fun???,"I bought this game to play with my kids, but really this is not very fun at all. It is a board game not very intresting."
5,Muy Divertido!!,Lo compre para mi hija de 5 Años!! y la verdad ahora todos los jugamos muy divertido para compartir en Familia!!
3,Game case in Spanish but no spanish in the game.,"Nintendo games are used worldwide and mostly by children so it is important that Nintendo issue games in languages other that English.Mario Party 8 case comes in English, French and Spanish so it is easy to suppose that the game works in those 3 languages, but it doesn't. That's tricky."
4,Our 5 year old loves it,"Great game for younger kids, as long as they can read or don't mind skipping some text. HUGE variety of mini games, and a lot of them are fun. Board game part is fun as well, with interesting twists to each board. Lots of stuff to unlock as you progress. Solid replay value.Better as multiplayer, but an adult will easily defeat a child and normal computer players. Kids should play other kids or the computer."
4,Party Time!,This is a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and I know she and her friends will have a great time with it.
5,It never ends!,"My five year old son keeps playing and playing and never gets tired of it, he always discovers new mini games to keep him entertained. It's renewed everyday."
5,Endless Fun!,"This game is so fun, plenty of options and different gameboards to never get bored of this game. I would say maybe minus 1/2 a star for some graphics, they could be better, but over all a 5 star game.This is the first mario party that I've owned but definitely not the first one I've played."
3,A Kids Review,"This game seems great at first, and is a lot of fun. Most gamers like to play the story mode first, but this games' story mode is extremely short.I am an experienced gamer, so it toke me two and half hours, and wasn't much fun. This game is fun if four unexperienced people play, but once you play this game about ten times, it gets BORING. Another downside about this game is there is no widescreen mode. If you can buy it for under 25 or so dollars, this could be a good buy."
4,Pretty Good,This game was pretty good but there are some things I like and don't like about the game.Likes:This game is like a board game and I love to play board games.The minigames are super fun.Great to play with friends.You can play Hard or Easy depending on how you good you are at it.You can save a current game if you're in the middle.Dislikes:There aren't a lot of courses ( 6 to be exact )Playing by yourself can get kinda boring if you set it to too many turns.There needs to be a choice for 5 or 10 turns ( where currently the lowest is 15 ) so if you want to play a quick game you can.You can only save one game at a time.Overall Mario doesn't disappoint but If you're looking for you're first Mario game on the Wii I'd rather take other Mario games over it. Overall rating: 7.5/10
4,Played and owned them all and....,"MP8 is a buy; the boards are fun and the gameplay too. The story should not be considered because the type of game; but it is good. The mini games are solid and only a few are terrible. The bonus sections are like always a waste but playing with your Mii is cool. Add this to your library. Check out MP9 coming on 3-11-12. Also I reccomend (MP1 (best), MP2 (On Virtual Console), MP4, MP5); try (MP6, MP7); avoid (MP3, MP DS, MP Advance)."
4,Surprisingly fun...,"As annoying as this game is, it's really a lot of fun! I played it with a few people at first and thought it was pretty entertaining, but after playing Mario Party by myself and enjoying it I knew it was a good game. I would recommend this game to everyone that enjoys fun."
3,Drawn out game board play,"I thought this game did not deliver, we ended up selling it back to the local video game store. The board game play was long and drawn out, the mini games were OK - but did not really take full advantage of the Wii's controllers. Also the computer characters always won, even when we tried to disable them with a handi-cap, they always got extra bonuses at the end and ended up winning."
3,fun but not entertaining,"ProsGreat for playing with little cousins, nephews, nieces, or grandchildren around the age of 8.great graphicsConsFor us hard core gamers stick with Halo or call of duty cause this can get boring in a hurry.Most of the games are the same with different themes.The anouncer talks waaaaaaaay too much!!!!OverviewThis game is OK for playing with the little ones as this game has supper easy controlsbut overall not one of my favorite games. If you want Mario, play Supper Mario Bros Wii."
4,Great buy,The game was great. It has lots of options and can be played by all ages. Hours and hours of fun.Have to have 2-4 players to really have a good time with game.
3,Very disappointing Wii debut for the series,"Everything that made Mario Party 7 interesting is carried over to Mario Party 8, but because Nintendo failed to add anything, it is disappointing. The Wii control abilities are not utilized particularly well, either; there's nothing in the game that requires the nunchuck or anything Wii-specific, aside from a few mini-games that require you to shake your Wii remote. Finally, for reasons I will never understand, the game itself is not in widescreen. This becomes even more bothersome when you realize that many other parts of this disc *are* in widescreen--just not the actual game play. Simply put, this is a great disappointment in an otherwise enjoyable series. Stick with Mario Party 7, and cross your fingers that Nintendo gets it right with the inevitable Mario Party 9."
5,Mario Party 8 for Wii,"I bought this game at the request of my grandson and he had played it at a friends house. He only wants to play this game and he won't take the disc out of the Wii. He is only 6 yrs old but he has mastered the games one by one. He loves to play ""Mario Party 8"" with his 5 yr old sister, mostly because he's teaching her how to play. He has had ""play dates"" with classmates where he ""teaches"" his friends how to play! He loves it! So I love it!"
1,WORST MARIO GAME THAT I HAVE,"When I played Mario Party 8 at a relatives house, I thought it would be very fun to have. I WAS WRONG. First, pretty boring game play. All you do is run around a board with whatever character you chose and play mini-games. Second, there is not really much to unlock. There are really only 3 main things to unlock. So pretty much it is just a board game on your TV. I am a Nintendo fan, but this is [...]. My advice is to play it at a friends house or rent it. I bought Mario Party DS, and it was better than the Wii version.RK Gamer"
1,Don't waste your money,"Sorry, but don't bother with this game. It's just a bunch of mini games and maybe it's fun for little kids, but I am really amazed at how limited and boring this game is."
2,A Booring kids party,"this is a verry booring kids party without drinks and girls, no seriusly shake the control one time and another that was the deal all the game, shaking for one thing or another later of 1 or 2 hours of playing result boring..."
1,not good,i received the item and it was scratched which was not included in the description. I returned it and haven't heard anything yet.
5,Long time favorite..........,My daughters game broke after Many years so were were happy to find and buy it again on Amazon.....Good price and very happy as always!~
4,Not Bad,"The Mario Parties have never been one of my favorites with Mario games. Although, it is really fun to play with friends, but it gets boring when you play single player. This is a nice game to own but if you don't play with other people the game gets boring."
4,Borad Game come to life,"It is your typical Mario Party, but with a the Wii's motion combined with the mini games. My favortie is the stings where you have to cut a string and hope it dosent send you flying.The game is fun for all ages and great to play with friends. Its a modified board game brought to life, due enjoy."
3,Not as good as I expected.,"Mario Party 8 fails to impress. When I first played it after buying it, it seemed like a bunch of fun. However, after playing the ""Superstar Battle Arena,"" which forced me to play 5 games in a row, followed by an extra game, which takes about 4 hours, I was turned off. Despite the many mini-games, a majority of them are just remakes of the old Mario Party games. Now I'm pretty bored of this game."
4,"Fun, but somewhat repetitive.","I know using the Wii controller would mean aiming the top towards the screen and shooting with the A button, but doing that minigame after minigame is a little exhausting.. and some times going through each round seems like it takes a long time.The game is competitive and fun. My children love it!"
3,"Some new, mostly old","I tried this out at a friend's house recently. Mario Party 8 basically boils down to the same Mario Party you've been attending since the N64 days, only now we've got some wii-specific motion controls. While these are entertaining, they're nothing so special that can't be found in other wii games. Tilt controller, swing controller, turn controller, etc. And with Wario Ware and Rayman: Raving Rabbids on the block, there's more than one quality party game to choose from now.Unless you absolutely need a Mario Party game -now-, I'd suggest waiting a bit to see if the eventual Mario Party 9 offers more innovations. In the meantime, there's plenty of other wii games to choose from."
2,It's just ok,"It's nothing like the N64 Mario Party. Game boards are mostly short and uneventful, minigames are pretty fun, and the gameplay is a bit slow."
5,Good game,"My boyfriend and I play this as a drinking game and its really fun. Only downside is that you can't have just two players, you have to use computer players, and it makes the game kinda slow."
4,Took Forever to get here,The game took forever to get here. The game isn't what i thought but the kids love it so thats all that matters.
3,It seems to be more for the little ones,"The game seems as though it would be better for little ones than for teens and up. It was fun, just not very challenging."
4,mario mike,"I bought this game for my 10 year old grand daughter. She told me she plays it a lot, so it must be fun for her. I received the game in good condition and and on time so I would highly recommend the seller."
3,Ugh..,"This game is not such a graeat game. I had high expectations for this game and it didn't come through. First- the game gets old fast the mini games are fun but after playing the game twice you played them all. 2- The point of the game is pointless, it's a boring version of monopoly. 3- If you are going to play this game by yourself, DONT BUY IT! It's so boring. The computer cheats and it's like playin monopoly by yourself."
4,Its Mario Party.,"Its Mario Party. Its fun, the mini games are innovative in the use of the wii-mote, its the sort of thing you can totally play with a bunch of friends. However, its not much fun alone, obviously haha, and it gets old after a while. As far as multi-player games for the Wii go, I think this is by far the best released so far, (as of this review on July 11 2007)"
2,What in the world?!?,"When I bought this game, I once again made the mistake of buying a Wii game blindly. I had never played it. I put the game in my Wii and was greeted with a sickeningly happy MARIO PARTY 8!!! What was even worse was the WELCOME TO THE STAR CARNIVAL I had to hear every time I turned the game on. After I got over that shock, I began to play. I soon met the hosts, Ballyhoo and Big Top. They are much more annoying than their names and they sounds they make when they talk give me a headache. I almost had a mental breakdown when Ballyhoo said phrases like ""pony up"". The other characters phrases aren't much better (Daisy says ""neato""!!!). The boards also have characters that are a little too childish for me. This game could have easily gotten five stars with Toadsworth returning as the host, less annoying characters, and more classic game boards.Please get Brawl, Mario Cart Wii, or a gamecube game. The long golden days of Nintendo are over."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I've only played two of the courses but neither were very fun. One was a one way path to the stars and the other you only earned stars as you ""invested"" in hotels. Some of the games were cute but I like past versions much better!"
2,A little lacking,"My son and I have enjoyed the Mario Party games but with the Wii Mario Party we feel that the mini games were lacking, they could be a lot better so we were disappointed. It seems that some of the mini games that are in previous games could of been incorporated with the 8 but weren't. There are a couple of mini games that are impossible to beat when playing against computer characters.We also think the game itself doesn't play as well as the others, for instance you get candy pieces that do different things when playing and we find that this feature doesn't really add anything to playing the game. We are just hoping that they will improve the game for when Mario Party 9 comes out."
2,Not Much of a Party,"I have owned the very first Mario Party for Nintendo 64 and now that I have purchased Mario Party 8 and played it, it's a HUGE downgrade! In the first Mario Party you can purchase different trophies to gamble your coins, different blocks to use on the game boards, break records, etc. In Mario Party 8, there isn't much you can do beside play the board games, the mini games aren't much fun, some of the new characters are plain and no matter how good you do in the board games, you still get the same amount of carnival cards! The bottom line is, this game is boring and nothing compared to the first Mario Party!"
5,super mario party 8,THIS GAME USUS ONLY THE Wii REMOTE. GREAT FUN FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES. I ENJPY PLAYING WITH THE GRANDKIDS AND ALSO MANAGE TO FIND SOME TIME FOR MYSELF.
4,Good game for groups game,"I bought this game for me 7 years brother and he loves the game. He likes to play alone and with his friends.Also, this game is super fun if you invited friends to play. I'm 22 years old and my friends always come to my house to playSome games are too easy, but the competition and the wii remote makes fun."
2,The Party is Not Here...,"I was really looking for a game that was going to be fun and exciting for not only young players but older ones as well. This was not that game. This game can quickly become boring and un-interesting for the older player, and is quite confusing for younger players. After playing Wii Sports, this game fails to impress."
2,"Weak, unoriginal and Bland","I had high hopes for this game. Nintendo could have done a lot with the wii's capabilities in a game like this. Nonetheless, all they did was recycle the same old button mashers or ""guess what bomb will blow up your friend"" type games. It was really disappointing and felt like the game was hastily thrown together. It felt more like a port from the gamecube than it did an original game. This is probably the worst nintendo made game out for the wii right now. Save yourself some money and wait till better multiplayer games come out."
3,It's Mario Party,"The title says it all, it's another Mario Party game, fun enough, pleasant enough but Nintendo has committed one of the cardinal sins of video games. Don't just keep repeating yourself. While the oppurtunity to really take full advantage of the Wii's unique controller is their, Nintendo makes no attempt to do so, instead pumping out a game which could have easily been released on the Gamecube. overall fun enough as a time killer with groups of people but not a must own."
2,"so far, not so good","I have played this game three times trying to get a good feel for it. So far, not so good! It is probably more of a kids game or a parent with kids game, but does not seem like a good party game for adults. I think, to be fair, the hype had me expecting more than what the game actually offers. Unless it is for kids, I would wait and get a used copy for less or at least rent it to see if it is the type of game you would enjoy for the money."
3,computer always wins,I get very fustrated because if you dont have enought players and the computer is playing with you...the computer always wins. it's rigged
3,Disappointed!,"I just bought my Wii yesterday, I was so excited to get the system and this Mario Party 8. However, I was disappointed when I loaded this game. I have to play the board games then I'll unlocked other minigames. They only have 4 minigames for you to play with at first, then the rest you have to play the board games which my son don't have the patient. I am a bit bore with this game too. Using the remote is a bit fuzzy for me. I bet some other games might have a better use with the remote, but not this one. I saw the preview commerial for this game and I was impressed! Now, I don't know if I will keep this game or not. If you are a Mario fan, you might like it. I like the other mario games better than this one."
2,Multi player good...game bad,We did not like this version as much as some of the older Mario parties.
3,Not impressed by the mario games!,"I loved mario growing up, nintendo, super nintendo, but once they went 3D I was too busy to get into them. Now we have a Wii for our kids, so I bought Mario Party 8 for them to play. My husband and I played one night for about an hour. After about 15 minutes we were both very bored by the repetativeness of the game. It just dragged on and on. There were no real levels or challenges. I miss the old mario games, with secret levels and real bad guys. Bowser and his boys have gone soft.It seems to me that the graphics got better but someone forgot the storyline, it's just silly games and pretty pictures."
3,"Good game could be better, however great mini games","Cons: The ever repetitive mini games that we are all so tired of; why can't they make one that plays through out the game?There are only six gameboards and they get repetitive and tiring. Why can't they make them lengthy game boards? I mean it is only 6 of them. NOTE: The game is played via gameboards, ala candyland style. When you hit a specific spot, you might get minigames. But i warn you these boards get really repetitive.You can not skip many repetitive scenes which really slow down the gameplay.PROS:If you love Mario Brothers, then you have to get this oneThese minigames are actually fun; unlike Wario Smooth Moves4 player means even more fun"
2,Not great when comparing to other kids games,"I read some really great reviews about this game. After the initial play, my kids haven't touched it since. When comaring it to other games such as Just Dance 3 or Kirby's Epic Yarn or Disney Universe, it really doesn't stand up to them. My kids are 6 & 8 which maybe why they are not very interested in it. For younger children I can see how it'd be fun."
4,"Party time: Great, Alone time: Average",If you are playing with 1 or more firends this is an A+ game. There is a lot of text that is involved and no quick way to by-pass it (even on fast message speed) or eliminate it. It would have been nice for Nintendo to have a disable option or actually have the guy talk to you as other platforms do. When on a single player mission the play is the same but just not as fun. After unlocking the 2 hidden characters and buying the extra games there is really no lasting appeal. Over all a very nice game that can be enjoyed alone or with friends. I hope the newer version will support online play as some of the games are going that way.
4,Great Family Game,My family and I really enjoy playing this together. The only real disappointment is that you have to play with a computer. So you either set is on Normal and except it will win all mini games when it is on its own but will help you when paired up. or set it to Easy and except if you have it as a partner you will have to do all the work.
3,Good game but could have more,I bought this game for large gatherings of friends. It works very well for the situation with a good variety of games. The variety in boards is also nice. But it feels like its missing something due to the fact it is for wii but doesn't use motion for a good amount of the game. Its a nice game to add to the collection especially if you use your wii for group occasions but between those occasions this game really wont get much use.
5,Mario Party 8 Forever!,"I really enjoy playing Mario Party 8 for Wii. The duel games are short and addictive. I highly recommend this title for all ages, it may be one of my favorite games of all-time and that's really saying something."
5,Mario Party 8,This is a fun game to play and I would recommend it for anyone who likes the previous versions of Mario Party.
3,"Fun game, but not one of the better Mario Parties","I am a HUGE fan of these Mario Party games.I think i had more expectations for this game since the last gens Mario Parties are quite often fun, especially part 6 & 7. This Mario party was fine, but i would much rather play the older versions with a newer control scheme. Even playing the older ones with the older control scheme would be fine.IF YOU CAN GET THIS CHEAP... knock yourself out."
4,my 5 year old grandson was estatic. He had been exposed by his friends. Now he has his own.,My grandson is 5-1/2 years old. He wanted this game for some time. I live in VA & he lives in CT. I had the game sent to him. He is very pleased that he has his very own now.
2,"Not her best, but ok","This author is usually good at establishing reasonable reactions in her characters, but in this case, the basis for the romance (patient-nurse relationship) is somewhat unbelievably sudden. The characters and plot are still reasonably interesting, but it is not my favorite of her books."
3,Not first rate Balogh,"I'm a big fan of Mary Balogh's work. She's a superior writer in the romance genre and has written some classics (No Man's Mistress, The Christmas Bride, Tangled, A Precious Jewel to name just a few) but this book is way below par for her. I agree with the reviewer above about the confused motivations of the heroine. It just doesn't work that she was deeply in love with her first husband and than, over a period of a few weeks, falls deeply in love with his one-time best friend. There was very little angst and little of the character soul-searching Balogh is famous for. Skip this one unless you can get it for free!"
4,"dellicate web, slowly built","Mary Balogh's books are all must reads. This one takes a bit longer than her others to get into but the final 85% of the book is a real page turner.The difference here from her other books is that she goes more deeply into the effects of battlefield conflict on the lives of her characters. This isn't done in a gory way, but rather on how the physical and emotional injuries affect the lives of her characters. This is done with tenderness and isn't depressive... it just adds more depth to the lives we're reading about.If this is a harbinger of her future work, she is striving to give a greater depth and interest to her protagonists. Good on her!"
5,WEB of LOVE.,"I really enjoyed the WEB of LOVE, as I do with all of Mary Balogh's books. I read all of them over and over."
3,Web of Love,I love this author. Story line was good but sometimes plodded along. I think I like her more recent books better than the older classics. Also I prefer the steamy scenes in the newer books.
1,still has not got here,I still dont have it. It was supposed to show up over a week ago but nothing has come. I dont know what the problem is. it could fit in a letter.
2,disappointed,"As mentioned by some, this toy was a bit of a challenge to put together. Once it was together my son couldn't wait to play with it. He had several of the vehicles along with the small loop tracks and the idea of a large track like this was very exciting. He didn't have a problem getting the vehicles to go all the way around. That seemed to work fine. The main problem we encountered with this toy is that it just would not stay together. My son became very annoyed with it. It got to the point where he didn't even want to play with it because it always came apart. I ended up throwing it in the trash. It is a large toy & takes up lots of space when assembled. I don't have enough space to keep junk like that around. It could've been a great toy if it was more durable."
2,Typical Hot Wheel quality,"We just purchased this toy when the Hot Wheel Cyborg Assault, my 4 yr old's gift from Santa, BROKE after a few minutes of (supervised) play. They were out of the Cyborg's so my son chose this. He is in there now calling it junk. It was confusing to assemble and the car will NOT stay on the track as it shows in the pictures, no matter how much you REV it. My son has a difficult time revving it without making it click, and then getting it on the track correctly is a trick. This one will probably go back to the store as well. I think we are done with Hot Wheels (for as long as I can get away with it!)"
3,"While my son had fun playing, it wasnt durable",If my son hadnt had so much fun playing it would have had less stars.the concept is definately 5 stars.the set itself lacks stability and falls apart way too easily.
1,toy has no value,"We are returning this toy after giving it to our 4-year-old for his birthday. It doesn't do what it is supposed to do (climb all the way up) and it is flimsy and doesn't stay together. Our son decided he didn't want to keep it. It has taken a while to get it back to the store, but even sitting out he and his 6-year-old brother have shown absolutely no interest. What a dud! Mattel should be ashamed of themselves -- do they not test these toys before releaseing them? If you already bought it -- return it. If you are thinking about buying it -- don't!"
1,Doesn't Work As Advertised,"My son got this as a Christmas present and is very frustrated because the cars will not stay on the track and flip around like it is supposed to. As others have said, it's just too flimsy and maybe if you hold the track together, you might get it to work. The magnetic cars are fun, but you can buy those seperately."
3,Rev-Up Car Cool; Track a No-Go,"I'd have to agree with those who claim the track is for older children to adults. My son enjoys the car. He's 4. But, he gets very frustrated trying to use the track as pictured on the box. It does not stay together well, and the plastic pieces have a tendency to bend out of shape and not stay together. A neat idea overall, but the durability of the design needs to be revised. The car would be a good buy at $5.00, but leave the track at the store for $20.00."
3,Typical results from a toy like this.....,"You need an adult or a child over about 8 to put this together. The car makes it most of the way around, but at a certain spot when it is upside down, it always seems to fall. This can get frustrating.I'll tell you one thing the picture on the box is attractive and any young boy opening this as a gift is going to be very excited!"
1,Rev-Up What?,"Talk about a waste of time and money. The track does not stay together properly and worst of all is the car that is supposed to make it all the way around the track. Well, no matter how hard you try to rev the car up - it fails 9 times out of 10 to make it around the track.My son received two of this item for his 6th birthday. We opened one, and promptly returned the other after the disappointment in the overall performance of the car and track. The one he kept has not been played with since."
3,It may be ok for older children,"This toy might be alright for older children, but it definately can be difficult for the younger child. To rev the car in order for it to continue through the entire track you need to do it slowly, which my child has no patience for. Then, when you get it going, it can be very difficult to place it on the track so it is aimed correctly and stays on. Its diffucult for an adult, nevermind a young child. i would say it is definately for children over 7, which my child is not. the manufactorers say 4 and up .... that is wrong. my child gets very frusterated with the toy and it is sitting in his room unused.... a waste of money on my part. The track also doesnt stay together very well, and the sky line bridge part gets messed up very easily and it becomes not aligned and then it doesnt work, so i have to check it each time we try to play with it to make sure it is in the right position."
2,When good ideas go bad...,"I bought the Skyway track for my son's 5th birthday. The track is difficult to assemble for an adult, it doesn't stay together, and the cars can't make it around the track without falling off. This was a real disappointment. A simplied system of the track would be so much more appealing and functional. It's more fun to roll the cars up the refrigerator door. Also, the rev ups cars themselves come apart. They are held together with rubberbands! I'm not sure why the manufacturer can't find a better way to attach the body of the car to the wheels. My son was quickly frustrated and then disinterested. This is a great idea very poorly executed."
2,Car never seems to go all the way around.,"We got this toy yesterday, putting it together was no problem although it's a bit wobbly but it didn't fall appart on us, but my son is having more fun with the car by itself, we tried and tried to rev it up enough to go all the way but it always seems to stop right in the middle before the upside down stunt, we tried to start reving it up in the middle but it still lost energy and stopped in the middle, and it's very slow, it's like looking at a turtle walk.. so my son lost interest in it and is now playing with the car on the fridge and the dishwasher (magnetic).. I think i'll try and get him the rest of the cars, maybe our car is faulty and if not, i think the cars by themselves are fun.I hope this helps."
4,the shabby chic of gift giving,I really enjoyed the clever crafts that are so simple even I am able to use some of these ideas.
2,Not enough good ideas for a book,"Rachel Ashwell makes incredibly beautiful fabrics and needs to stick to what she knows best. She offers some good ideas in this book, but not enough - some of her ideas are downright tacky. I'm a big fan of Shabby Chic and was disappointed with this book. If you've seen some of her shows on the Style Channel, then you've seen enough."
3,Expectations,Not up to my normal expectations for a book by Rachel Ashwell. Most of her books are quite fabulous. Sorry.
1,A bit of a let down,I really liked her other Shabby Chic books and enjoy reading and looking at them this one was a bit of a let down.It would have been better in a magazine format
1,Really stretching to make this a book,"The good ideas in this book would have made a great magazine article, but that's about it. I have all of the other Shabby Chic books and I love them, but this one was a big letdown. I couldn't believe there was a chapter on how to decorate your kid's lunch! Another thing--the publisher calls this a hardcover, but it's not."
1,...,"What a disappointment! There are no projects with directions, and what the author deems inspirational ideas consist of such things as SEVERAL PAGES describing why it is nice to stick a loving note in your kids' lunchboxes. Mind you, I would have been delighted with a book of inspirational ideas -- but this sure wasn't it. I'd be ashamed to give 99% of the items as gifts; they're both tacky and yucky. The few decent ideas (gifts of herbs or flowers, citing the meaning of each) are old hat if you read any books, magazines, or online crafts lists. This was a huge disappointment and a colossal waste of money; what could have been wonderful instead seemed heavily padded to use up space, rather than providing viable/innovative ideas (or even good ideas, never mind original). I returned mine to Amazon."
3,Nice Fire Batons . . .,"w/ Brock-gtr/synth/vcl, Bridget Wishart (guest)-vcl, Bainbridge-kybrd/vcl, Alan Davey-bass/vcl, & Richard Chadwick-drmAccording to the Amazon description this is a 1 DVD set. I purchased this some months ago when it was a 2 CD set with Disc 1 mislabeled Disc 2 and Disc 2 mislabeled Disc 1. On both discs track breaks happen in the middle of songs as much as in between them seemingly at random! I will refrain from posting the track listing as who knows which disc(s) will actually show up.DVD 1 and some of 2 features a live concert filmed with a hand-held video cam which is probably also the source of the sound - muddy with a little hiss and noise in the background but better than most bootlegs. Video footage is primarily of the band and stage from pretty far away. Bass is a little low in the mix but the guitar sounds crisp and vocals are so-so."
5,CD sounds even BETTER,"This music was wonderful on the original vinyl album. But it is even BETTER on CD. Overall, this is my FAVORITE Gary Wright album. It really deserved more recognition than it was given. For anyone who is REALLY into Gary Wright, beyond THE DREAMWEAVER album, this one is a MUST for your collection. The music and backing vocals are INDESCRIBABLY SUPERB!!!"
4,Overlooked but very enjoyable,"For years this album was unavailable on CD - and it was the main reason I still kept my record player. Because ""Light of Smiles"" is just as good as the majestic and much more famous ""Dream weaver"".This album is similar to its predecessor, but a bit more 'dreamy', a bit softer, although in the excellent ""Are You Weepin"" it does contain one of Gary's most rocking tracks. ""Silent Fury"" and strong opener ""Water Sign"" are also quite dynamic but many other songs are much softer. Overall this creates a gentle and very enjoyable mood. Best of the softer tunes are ""Time Machine"" and ""Who Am I"", but this album doesn't contain any weak song really. Strongly recommended to anyone who enjoyed ""Dream Weaver""."
5,Very sexy...,"This movie was awesome. I actually bought it thinking that it was another movie, but I am glad that I did buy it. There is a very interesting story to this movie."
5,i need yr helping for buy this dvd....,"could u let me how to buy the dvd ""i like to play games"" ?i want to buy some dvd about 'lisa boyle"" but i stay in hong kong & no idea for buying the goods !!! if any idea , pls e-mail to me <dicky_teg@hotmail.com> thx ."
2,Violence at end took away from sexuality,"A lot of violence at the end, took away from the sexuality.Not that good, try some else. Bye Bye"
1,Deceptive Title!,"I purchased this book based upon its title and cover imagery; I was disappointed in that many if not most of the images and drawings contained in the book are NOT located in Washington, DC, as the title would have you believe. It's ok to illustrate other images by the same architect or draftsman, but the book includes tens of dozens if not hundreds of illustration that are located thousands of miles away from Washington, DC, the city. A better title would have been ""architectural drawings at the Library of Congress"" and leave out the reference to the actual City of Washington, which is not well represented."
5,Incredible!,"I felt like I was hearing the history my teachers hadn't told me about. I love the mix of voices and viewpoints. I'd be hard pressed to pick out a favorite, although Utah Phillips comes close. This album made me a Paul Robeson fan. I listen to it whenever I want/need to rev up my engines to fight for justice."
3,Music by and about Joe Hill,"Joe Hill a saint of our century to many is only remembered by a few and for a few songs. This man made a difference, and this album gives you a flavor of that act. I wish that more of his music could be played and not the few that are song by the many."
5,"Great for tooth trimming, too","The vet gave us one of these for a pet rat with a malocclusion. This way, we can trim her teeth at home without taking her to the vet and spending the $10 every couple of weeks. It's a lot easier on everyone, including the rat! And cheaper, too. The scissors do dull quickly when you use them on teeth, so you'll need a new one every few months."
4,At Their Peak,"Before Sting fell in love with vapid pseudo-jazz, before Pop reverted to thinly-disguised disco, before Metal collapsed into shred, before American radio completely abandoned Rock...Synchronicity! A great album from a nearly great band. Sting was a fine writer before his ego got too bloated, this album is the proof. He ended up leaving it all behind to make John Tesh-like albums of aural wallpaper, but I still put this CD on and can forget his lamer moments."
5,Why?,"Why am I the first one to review this album? This is a hailed as a rock classic everywhere, so why am I the first to review this? Well anyway, this is one of my favorite albums ever. When Every Breath You Take came out, it was my favorite song. And this classic album will surely stand the test of time. Sting sings up a storm here, with the classic bass. I love this album."
5,"With one breath and one flow, you'll LOVE Synchronicity.","The Police's masterpiece that solidified their place in music history, as one of the greatest bands of all time. Synchronicity is the proof of the Police's evolution from ""fake punk"". Of course, Synchronicity is mostly known for the Grammy Award winning ""Every Breath You Take"" (WHICH IS NOT A LOVE SONG)...but the rest of the album is a work of art. Other singles like ""King of Pain"" and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" showcases Sting's amazing lyrical writing. ""Synchronicity II"" also won a Grammy for best rock song. Even though all but two songs were written by Sting, the two songs that are usually overlooked were ""Mother"" written by Andy Summers and ""Miss Gradenko"" written by Stewart Copeland, both deserving as much recognition as the rest of the album. Overall, Synchronicity has it all, and it was Sting, Stewart, and Andy's gift to the musical world...before they left us."
2,The Police's worst album,"Ugh! I loved this in the summer of '83, but its aged worse than I have. This really doesn't hold up 16 years later. Granted their are some timeless classics like ""Every Breath You Take"" and ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"", and ""Synchronicity II"" is interesting, but the rest of this reflects a struggle between Sting's ego and the other musicians' desire to be heard. The result is we're left with junk like ""Walking In Your Footsteps"", ""Miss Gradenko"", ""Mother"" and ""O My God"". Please...."
3,Well worth a listen.,"Synchronicity is a better-than-good album from The Police. It has good energy and creativity. There are eleven tracks, and the album is in a progressive pop direction. ""Mother"" is the only tune that I have a hard time listening to. The music to the song is pretty cool, but the vocals are annoying. A lot of the songs on Synchronicity have an atmospheric quality to them that's very nice. Sting's vocals are good, and the album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight. Some of the songs that I like are ""Every Breath You Take,"" ""Wrapped Around Your Finger,"" and ""Synchronicity II."" ""Tea in the Sahara"" is also a relaxing and atmospheric tune. This is quite an enjoyable and impressive album. I actually give it 3.5 stars. It's well worth a listen."
5,Non-stop great songs.,"The only regret of Synchronicity is the Andy Summers tune ""Mother"". This song is so bad it could not have been saved if Sting himself had sung it.Summers other song ""Murder by Numbers"" is great; which proves that he can write decent music, but can't discriminate between his good and his bad work. Even the songs that were not singles are phenomenal. Sleeper hits are 'Tea in the Sahara' and 'Oh My God'. This is a must own for anyone."
2,"This One, Not So Much...","If you want to discover The Police, do yourself a favor and check out their first two releases, Outlandos d'Amour (released November of 1978, highlights include Roxanne, Masoko Tanga) and Regatta De Blanc (which translates to ""White Reggae"" released October, 1979, highlights include Message In a Bottle, Walking On the Moon, Bed's Too Big Without You). These releases have the vital energy and punk-reggae-power-trio sound that really got them noticed. I also recommend 1980's Zenyetta Mondatta. The first release in the States that got a lot of airplay on the radio, Zenyetta Mondatta managed to be commercial success while carrying forward that great sound. Hits include De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da, Don't Stand So Close To Me, Canary In a Coalmine. I purchased Ghost in The Machine when released and that was the end for me. With this release their sound began the downward spiral, losing the energy and fun of their initial releases.Outlandos d'Amour [Digipak]Regatta De Blanc"
4,Surviving the Test of Time,"While the sound the band uses in this album (as in others) sounds somewhat dated in a few of the songs for the year 2000, most of the songs remain timely and fresh. Synchronicity II and Every Breath You Take seem even more powerful when listened to consecutively. It makes you really wish for a Police reunion."
1,"Not an Embarrassment of Riches, just an Embarrassment","Regardless if it's the original, gold, remastered, DTS remastered, digipak, or SACD version this album is pretentious crap!The band was so good before the blossoming of Sting's ego and this release. It's hard to believe people actually enjoy tracks like Walking In Their Footsteps, Mother, Miss Gradenko, King of Pain, Wrapped Around Your Finger, Tea in the Sahara and Murder By Numbers. Are you all librarians?File this under the new music category Flaccid-Rock. Right beside Kenny G, Michael Bolton and Sting."
2,2 channel SACD? why even bother????,"If I had known that this SACD was only a 2 channel SACD, I would not have even bothered.Playing the original CD in all channel mode sounds better than this pile.Man, after listening to (my only other SACDs, so far) Joe Satriani's Strange Beautiful Music, and the 30 year anniversary hybrid SACD of Dark Side of the Moon, (both amazing in 6 channel SACD) this was a huge letdown.I like the album a lot, and am a big fan of The Police, but if you already have the original CD, THERE IS NO REASON to buy this thing, the better sampling rate doesn't help it a bit (get it?... hehehe).Call The Police, I've been ripped-off.!!!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
5,Wonderful ... nothing else to say.,"This one will be short. This is one of the best albums of the entire rock era. A true & total masterpiece. Start at the beginning & just wait for my all time fave Synchronicity II to come on...and you think the first half is good ?Side 2 was one of the most choice album sides ever (along with Side 1 of REO's ""Hi Infidelity""). It still is today, 20 years later.Get this one today; I promise you will not be disappointed."
4,"Great CD, better on SACD than ever, great to actually Hear it","another great example of why SACD sounds so good. I know almost all thesesongs but never been able to hear the this clarity.Stand out tracks..Walking in your footsteps, king of pain, Synchronicity II. The music departure that seems to happen with some songs when transferred to SACD is sometimes stark and you have listen to those songs you know all over again. The 3 mentioned above definitely give back that feel.Great SACD, definitely recommend to anyone that has a SACD player.I listened to this using my 60GB PS3 which is SACD capable (not all ps3 units are) and actually think it could sound better on a dedicated SACD player."
4,The Police's last and best album,"This was The Police's last album, and it was also its best. It was also its most popular album: when it came out, in 1983, I was 15, and I remember all my high school classmates were listening to it all the time. There is the hit single Every Breath you Take (a tale of a disturbed stalker disguised as a love song), the faux-oriental Wrapped Around your Finger (who can't forget Sting in the video dressed as a martial artist jumping around the burning candles?), the great Synchronicity II (great lyrics, and with the trio singing in the video in a sort of post industrial wasteland), King of Pain. Sting's pretentiousness as a lyricist is so over the top that it can be almost touching: Tea in the Sahara was inspired by Paul Bowles' novel The sheltering Sky, the title track is reportedly inspired by writings of Koestler. And what other pop artist of the 80s would mention Scylla and Charybdis (as he does in Wrapped...) or Spiritus Mundi (in the title track)?"
2,Makes a great frisbee if your dog doesn't mind...,"Eeeeeeeek! How sad that this fine band didn't bow out on a higher note. 'Mediocrity' is the key word here (OK, OK, it has one good song on it. And I'm not saying which one it is.) It also ties with 'Zenyatta Mondata' for the title of the Ugliest Police Record Cover. Buy any of the other four Police albums before you buy this one. Woof woof!"
3,It's the Police,"It's the Police. I bought this when it came out just because it was big at the time. Not a big Police fan. Never was. It's OK for bringing back some old memories of the time, but not my style of music."
5,Prop Police most popular,"Too bad this was their last. Of course there is 80s poppy ""Every Breath You Take"", but beyond that one is classic Police. Can def hear the world music influence."
3,Contains Sugar!,"I received this thinking that the picture of the nutritional panel was the entire nutrition panel, it's not. These tablets also include sugar. Make them taste pretty great but I wanted something much more pure."
1,beware,This product has FD&C Yellow #6 Lake in it for those of you trying to live as chemical free as possible.
3,Friends Are Always There for You,The Sweet Valley: Surprise! Surprise! is a really good book. It teaches how two twin sisters care about each other and how friendship works. It also teaches that friends are always there for you. I really enjoyed reading this book and I read it all in one day because it was very hard to stop. I recommend this book to the people that like to read books about friendship because this book all it talks about is friendship. So what are you waiting for? Start reading it!!!
5,Surprise Surprse!,This book is really great I love this book I think that this book is clever and fun i read it like two or three times!
2,A fair look at a great race,"I got this book recently, and am not particularly happy with it. In 288 pages the author attempts to cover one of America's most important road races over a span of 45 years. Contrast this to LeMans 1960-69 which devotes 352 pages to only 10 years of that event. Around 100 pages is devoted to tabular material and index with minimal illustration. Most years are covered in 4 pages, and a few only have 2 pages of text and photos devoted to them in the body of the book. The author tried to choose between 2 and 5 photos per race with another in the tables.I was lucky enough to attend this race in 1965, 1966, and 1967, and hoped for more from this book. I'll keep this book, as it is the only book that covers this classic race, but would love to see one written with more detail, and a better selection of photographs."
4,So Cute!,My son is obsessed with water animals and LOVES his manatee! He even brings it to school. We were surprised to find out it's flipper sqeaks and he pretends it's talking to me. It's a great friend for bedtime and we are very happy with it.
2,WHY NOT CALL THIS DIE HARD 4? ENOUGH ALLREADY!,Jeff Wincott the action-martial arts underground hero tries to imitate the DIE HARD legacy here in an all too familar terriotry with the same kind of villains i`ve seen countless times before. Wincott plays a former FBI agent who comes back to duty when he finds out his father has been kidnapped by terriosts and is held hostage in a chemical plant. High kicking action and mornic shootouts can`t possibly save this film from repeating the same action from previous film of the genre. And let`s face it Jeff Wincott is no Bruce Willis.
5,Open fire,This is a great Jeff wincott movie a Great early 90s martial arts flick acting isn't to bad either just wish it was on DVD though
2,Not her best,"I've read all Kat Martin's books and enjoyed them all, except this one. This was predictable and boring. Hopefully her next will have the same flair as her previous books."
2,Same old story line!,"I do believe some authors are suffering from writers' block and hence churning out a lot of gibberish now a days. Kat Martins' Wicked Promise is one of those books probably written when she underwent a writers' block.The story line is so oft repeated that there is nothing much to say about it, but what takes the cake are the lead characters, especially Elizabeth.Both the h&h are irritating to the core and garner no sympathy. It was not a very long book, but it still took 5 days for me to finish it.SKIP THIS ONE!"
4,Unusual,"The fact that the hero is married (though estranged) makes this romance a little different; it's an impossible love, and Nicholas realizes that att he same time that he can't stay away from Elizabeth. His self sacrifices near the end are wonderfully emotional and compelling. She's a little naive, but very likeable. She certainly has a warm, gentle heart. The murder mystery is very well done. It's not the best Kat Martin that I've read, but it's one of the more enjoyable books I've read lately. The adultery is tough to swallow, but if you can do that, the rest is a pleasure. I definitely need to go back and read Rand's story."
2,Really?,"20-yr-old ward moves into her rakish guardian's estate in order to be protected by molestation attempts of lecherous & obssessive man. She becomes attracted to him, despite knowing about his reputation & ex-convict past. But Hero is married but estranged from his wife for 9 yrs Hero. Hero tries to fight off his attraction to heroine b/c of his married status & tries to marry her off to a respectable man.Although Martin's writing is good, I did not find hero's sudden change from an uncaring, debauched man to a guilt-ridden, humbled one convincing. Martin didn't develop the romance between Hero & heroine enough to make that kind of major personality switch realistic. Also, the final outcome of Hero's estranged wife was too cliche.Cautiously recommended."
3,Love Jo,So I love Jo Koy but all the highligts of this dvd can be found for free on youtube eventhough he hates youtube. Other than that funny dvd but not hilarious.
3,Great Starting Point,"Good book for starting, but does have some errors and not clear at times as to what the author is wanting you to do. But for the basics, it is one of the easiest books that I have read. Gets you up and going fast, and shows you the basics.Some of the errors, typos and their screen, does not match yours. (Entered the work three times and still did not match). Plus if things don't match, the author does not tell you how to fix the problem or where to look.Still all in all it is a good book to learn from."
1,NO CUSHION TO THIS CUSHION!!!,"I bought this cushion to provide some ""cushion"" for my daughters wooden highchair and while I was expecting to receive it in a box, it comes in an envelope. It does fit my Jenny Lind style highchair and it is very pretty. However, they should advertise it as a very cute piece of fabric! I wrote the company and they basically told me that mine was not defective and that this is how it comes. If only they would at least throw a couple of cotton balls in there for a $70 cushion!! I gave it one star for cuteness. In the picture it looks like it has some cushion in it, but buyer beware that it does NOT!!!"
4,nice,"The handbook provides good explanations. Although it is 3 codes old, it is good enough for guys just starting out and learning. The substance of the code has not changed, but the chapters have been re-arranged."
1,Dissappointed,"I have to say I'm dissappointed in this product. I wanted to keep some ants away and it's had no effect at all. A little tiny spider has even built a web off it. It's supposed to keep those away too. Anyway, I can't return it becuase I would have to pay shipping and handling and that would cancel out the refund."
1,Useless product,"I bought a set of 5 (or maybe 6) and put them in the garage and basement to get rid of spiders and small crawling bugs. Months later, conditions are still the same."
1,Pest Repeller.,I am sorry I purchased this pest repeller. After plugging it in we had more ants than before. Another high priced low quality piece of junk.
4,Actually worked for us,"We got this several years ago to deal with an ant problem, and we were overrun. Within 2 days, we had no more problems--it worked awesome. I don't know about stinkbugs, spiders, or bigger bugs, but ants disappeared. Just recommended it to my folks, too."
4,The Sweet Encouragment of Poetry,"Helen Rice captures your heart with every line. She is umistakably talented, and her book is a must have to any home library. She uplifts the heart and chalenges the mind, leaving the soul with a new and brighter perspective."
4,Nice brackets,The brackets look very nice in my application. I couldn't believe how hard it was to find mounting hardware for narrow shelves before going online with Amazon. One little complaint: it would have been nice if the brackets had come with matching black iron screws. I had to use galvanized ones from the local home-improvement store and then paint them.
5,GET THIS BOOK!,"I couldn't agree with Bob Carpenter more! I do exactly the same thing. I started making the ice creams and sorbets this summer. I've been making ice cream for twenty years - it's NEVER been better. I DO bake, unlike Mr.Carpenter, but I've been so wrapped up in the frozen desserts that I haven't even gotten to the baked stuff. Bob, if you haven't, make the meyer lemon sorbet. It's a revelation. Lindsey Shere's retired now, and I guess that means no more books. Too bad. She was a true original."
5,Delighted!,"I 'loaned' this book to my daughter five years ago, moved out of Berkeley, and waaaah! Couldn't find another copy in local bookstores, so tried Amazon. Terrific service by this provider. I am so glad to have it again - the recipes are wonderful! Thanks!"
4,chez panisse desserts,Purchased this just before holidays so I have only briefly perused. I am anxious to try the recipes from this restaurant extraordinaire!
5,Weather for Dummies,"I didn't realize we had inherited a copy of this book from my father-in-law until I found it rather late in the semester I took Meteorology. I read it cover-to-cover while studying for the final and managed a 'B' which for me on a science topic was AWESOME. Eric Sloane's simplistic explanations and drawings helped this non-science major grasp some of the tougher concepts.The only time I really NOTICED how old it is was when he mentioned how the earth would appear if one were to take a trip into space in a suit made of air -- we hadn't landed on the moon when this was written. No mention of ozone or the top two levels of the atmosphere either but, hey, who knew they were there in 1949?"
5,Excellent,This author knows how to explain things.You can learn about the weather with the ease of reading a story !!
3,Is Your Kid a Francophile? Do you love Peter Mayle?,"This book is a little dry. If your kid isn't already familiar with truffles and boars they may wonder why you selected this book for them. But if you are a fan of Peter Mayle and want to introduce your kid those little French nuances, this might be the book for you. It's about a piggy who can sniff out the yummy truffles, but not allowed to enjoy them himself, as he is owned by someone greedy. My paperback copy arrived a little ripped up."
2,Works but...,"Although this cover does fit, and does protect your LG 8300, it pops loose very easy and I lost the top in a theater the first time I wore it in public, (it caught on the chair arm and went flying), so if you need your phone secured, this is not the cover for you."
2,the content is too shallow,"I bought this book because of the title, but unfortunately the content is too shallow. It's very, very basic. There is no technical part. If you want to understand XML and Web Services, I would recommend XML Handbook 4th edition by Charles F. Goldfarb and Paul Prescod."
4,He Should Write Faster,"When searching for a book on XML I came across this book and thought I recognized the name. Yes, this is the same guy who used to write a regular column for Network World for many years and if I am not mistaken for Data Communications prior to that. I used to like his columns so I took a gamble with this book. The book, to my delight, is just like his columns. Provocative, informative, challenging and often peppered with humor, folklore and good suggestions. Though XML isn&#65533;t its main focus it does provide some insight into XML and Web services and its treatment of portals is well worth looking at. I just wish he would write about more topics because his style and approach makes it easy to wade through technical material."
1,come bite me?,My wife and I both tried this mosquito repeller. Instead ofrepelling I truly think it attracted mosquitos. We got morebites with it than when we turned it off.
3,Mosquito repellers,"I liked the idea of a mosquito repeller small enough to wearon your person; but the only problem is there are numerous species of mosquitos, and it doesn't always work for the type mosquitos in the area in which one lives."
1,This thing ...!!,"This repeller (if you can call it that way) doesn't have a led indicator, so you'll never knows if the battery runs out or even if it is working. And the worst of all: the mosquitos neither seems to be aware of this!!"
5,DOC WATSON FAN,I FIRST HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE OF HEARING THESE TWO FANTASTIC CDS A FEW YEARS AGO. THEY REALLY TURNED ME ON TO DOCS MUSIC. I OWN MOST OF DOCS CDS THESE TWO CDS ARE DEFINITLY THE BEST OF THEM ALL. OTHER RECOMMENDED CDS BY DOC WATSON COUNTRY ON PRAYING GROUND (BLUEGRASS GOSPEL)
3,Clarence Ashley and Doc Watson Folkways 1960-1962,This CD collection is on the okay status with me. It is not a very good viewing of either of these gentlemen. It makes both of them look and sound like not good entertainers when they really are. There are also alot of older 1920's songs on here that were re-worded and were smashed to smitharines. I would not recommend this to anyone and besides to me it is to modern in musical ways also. Bad example of both of them.
3,Clarence Ashley/Doc Watson Review,"I'm a big Doc Watson fan and was expecting more vocals from Doc. The CD featured more Ashley and less Doc than I expected. I was somewhat disappointed. If you're buying this CD because your an Ashley fan then I'd think that you'll find it satisfying. On the other hand, if you're getting it because you want to hear Doc, then you may be less than satisfied."
4,Solid science fiction by evocative author Catherine Wells,"I first read Catherine Wells's work in an anthology, Wastelands, of post-apocalyptic/disaster ficton. Her piece--I fear I forget its title but contained the word ""Archie""--stood far above the rest, with enormous emotional impact. So I opened Mother Grimm expecting, probably, more than any but the best fiction can give. And this novel is not quite up to that wonderful best--but, once again, it stands far above most science fiction novels of its sort, dealing with a young woman's explorations, forced as she seeks to escape the crushing role limitations inside the civilized hunkerings of the safety Dome, out in an unknown and mostly brutal wild, unsheltered area. Wells's reolution of the resultant struggles and cultural clashes (a mild name for what must take place) is brilliant and satisfying.A good read I much recommend."
3,"Good, but not great","I liked the plot of the book. However, the ending was rather lame. Three laymen sitting around solving a murder while one of them puts the data on a computer and all of a sudden the main character figures out who-done-it. Really couldn't buy that angle. Otherwise it was good reading."
1,(...) Business is not a game.,"Isiah, in an attempt to explain the fundamentals of basketball and business, fails to explain how he single-handedly drove a 50+ year-old league (the Continental Basketball Association)completely into the ground in one year's time. He seemed to forget his fundamental of not paying the millions of dollars he ended up owing several hundred creditors. He also left out his fundamental of leaving plenty of hardworking people in his wake while he walked away unscathed. (...)Isiah writing a book about business is about as preposterous as his old coach Bobby Knight writing a book about etiquette. My advice? If you'd like to buy a book about business, buy one written by a businessman. If you'd like to read about Isiah, it's simple: just read Chapters 7, 11 and 13. They seem to be his favorite."
2,"How can lust, betrayal and death be so boring?","As a gay man I long for a gay themed book where the protagonists are not incredibly attractive, facile and morally bankrupt.The issues these characters are dealing with are compelling yet Sam Solomon and Bobby LaCour are so trite and one dimensional,not to mention emotionally stunted, it is impossible to relate or care about them. The author gets points for the intereseting art history lesson."
2,So?,"With the incredible cover artwork on this book, who couldn't like it? Me, for one. It is clear this author writes clearly and lyrically, but the 2 main characters, Sam and Bobby, were un-fleshed out and one-dimensional. They were both gorgeous, ho-hum, but I didn't feel I knew much else about them. There seemed to be a lot of potentially interesting things to do with these characters -- things that never got done.The bitter old Elliot and Sam's bisexual possibility, Jessie, were so much more interesting and believeable that they overshadowed the 2 protagonists."
2,2 more beautiful facile gay men,"I began reading this book with great anticipation, having enjoyed ""Clara's Heart"" in the past. There are interesting twists to this novel - an intense, important friendship between the main character and a female-ex lover, a complicated relationship between Bobby and the art collector, but, but, but. What I really missed was any sense of real emotional depth between the characters in these supposed love relationships, once again seeing gay men portrayed as having no ability to do anything except have sex. Would some other author besides David Leavitt please bear witness to this amazing fact? And maybe give us some gay men who are, for once, not the hallmark of physical perfection---that would be an original idea!!"
4,"A stylish combination of love, art history, and modern life","I enjoyed this novel a lot. It is nice to find a US author who can write reasonably well about the UK (although there were a lot of ""Oxbridge"" accents mentioned). I think the element of mystery/suspense should also be stressed...the reader is led along and made to wait for explanations. The characterisation is good: Sam and Bobby are not ""one-dimensional"" and Elliot Garland is a very well-observed and understandable portrait. The funniest moment for me was the darkly satirical account of the publisher's lunch in Manhattan. I also enjoyed the art history angle."
3,Thoughtful,"I agree foremost that the shaky camerawork was suitable for the movie, but annoying, nonetheless. And there was no music either, I noticed--which also fitted the movie so it's okay.I read all the rave reviews of this movie and decided I had to see what all the fuss is about.I wasn't expecting such a barebones movie. It wasn't until days later that I could really reflect on how much I liked the movie.Yeah--Rosetta's story is universal. A girl who simply wants to have a job and a normal life, despite the abnormalities of her reality. There's millions of girls and boys like Rosetta the world over.But . . . I don't wanna say anything bad about this movie cuz I know I'll upset someone--this movie wasn't as compelling as I'd expected. It's definitely not entertaining. More of a thoughtful piece, intended to make us think."
2,very overrated movie,according to some reviewers the main quality of this movie is theminimalist approach. This movie is shot as a documentary and the directors do not make the slightest attempt to improve it.It is raw life indeed but almost anyone can make a movie of this type - the most difficult part being to wake up in the morning and find the location.
2,As an aside,"The pot works fine, like the swivel feature. But it took me 40 MINUTES with a plastic spatula at the sink to get the incredibly irritating label off of the carafe! Seriously? I this some kind of a sick joke? They can't use post-it note type glue,they have to use the industrial strength? I was tempted to simply send it back. The vendor sent it promptly, so they're great, but I will think twice about buying another THermos brand product. If they're thoughtless/careless about the irritating label, what else are they thoughtless/careless about?"
4,Decent one,"I boil hot water in the morning, then put in it, the water still hot in the evening. Next morning the water is just warm. It can keep the water hot around 9 hours."
2,OUCH... this pot design pinches fingers!,"I have uesd many thermal pump pots and found this one really needs improvements on it's ""open top"" button and it's ""pump-action"" button. These buttons are really unstable and wobbly and thus getting ones fingers pinched in them is common place...OUCH!There is a MUCH better design to look for that we use at work that looks very similiar to this one but has instead lid opener buttons on the sides of spout (MUCH better design) and also has a stainless steel pump bar that lifts up and locks in place for pumping. Look for this design rather than this all plastic one and I guarantee you will be much happier with it. When I purchased this one I was actually thinking it would be similiar to the ones we use at work but I was wrong. I actually hate this one and regret getting it. I didn't read or look at the picture closely enough to realize this one didn't have side buttons or stainless pump bar. Dang, I wished I'd looked before I leaped and bought this one."
1,Doesn't keep coffee hot very long,"Maybe I got a bad one, but it does not keep my coffee hot for even a few hours. Every morning when I make a pot of coffee, I fill a Nissan stainless thermos and fill this 2-qt Beverage Pot about half full. The Nissan thermos keeps the coffee hot for 8 or 10 hours, but this pot does so poorly that I am not using it regularily anymore. There is no visible breakage of the glass, but something is not right with it. At least the price was low."
5,Great Buy for the Green Minded,"Not only does this insulated carafe keep its contents hot for nearly 24 hours but it does it with just the energy needed to make it in the first place, no need for warming plates and electric bills, for a days worth of hot coffee. The pump fills a 24oz cup in 2 full presses or 3 frantic ones, and the swivel base makes it easy for a few people to gather in while making their own hot cup a' Joe. Cleaning is not bad, use a scrubby wand or fill, close, shake and repeat for the rinse."
2,Disappointing,Does not keep hot beverages hot for as long as I was led to believe based on other reviews.
3,Not as good as before,I bought this thermos to replace an older model. It will not keep coffee as hot as the one it replaced of the same brand.
4,Great Price,"The Thermos Beverage Pot is a great economically priced product. Comparatively, it is the best priced dispenser I have found. The negative side to this product is it dents fairly easily and the glass interior will break if dropped. You could pay $50-60 for higher end dispensers. Just be careful with it and save $40."
5,Great Product,"I took this product to my office and used it during our staff meeting, It was a huge success....everyone loved it."
1,Impossible Label!,"I received this thermos and it took me 30 minutes to remove the label. In the process, I dented thermos on the sick because I had to scrub so hard after soaking in scalding water. The item arrived without a packing slip so I cannot return."
4,Keep things warm!,"It is a great thermal dispenser, too bad that it is huge. I tried to find smaller sizes but no success. But at least it does the job very well to keep the water, tea, coffee warm for a long time."
2,Looking for something better,I am using these for events and have shattered one using a bottle brush. The pump has failed/gotten stuck on 2 and one has leaked out the bottom for no apparent reason. I am in the market for a two quart hot beverage dispenser that is easy to use and clean. These last less than a year. I am in the market for something better.
5,Does the job very well,"Walmart stopped carrying this product in their stores so I had to order through Amazon. I bought two because at our AA Club Room, we drink a bunch of coffee and it gets lots of use. This ""pumper"" model is not as easy to use as the old lever style but the lever kept breaking and the manufacturer discontinued it and only sells the pumper model now. I'm a happy customer."
4,Thermos Air pot,"Product is exactly as specified. The button to dispense the coffee requires a little more effort than the ones that use a lever, but the low cost makes that a non-issue. It will keep coffee drinkably hot for at least 8 hours."
5,Greattttttt,"This was a delight to have, I have used this quite often and it is really wonderful, they keep things cold longer then anything I have as well as hot. I am very pleased. Thank you sent the items right on time. Ruth Delfino"
4,NO ICE CUBES!,I enjoyed the one day I got to use this. I bought it 2nd hand with no instructions. I put water in it yesterday then ice cubes. Today I put ice cubes 1st and the 6th cube going it shattered the thermos like a gun shot as some one said. I'm so disappointed but my fault. It was great to keep cold water on hand for a hot day out. But lesson learned.
5,Great Thermos,"This is a great thermos for the price. I have only used it to store hot coffee in it. I do arts and craft shows and farmers markets and at times I will make the coffee in the evening around 9 pm CST and the coffee is piping hot 12 hours later when the shows open at 9 am the next morning. The thermos is glass lined which keeps anything hot, hot for many hours. I have not experimented with cold liquids yet, therefore I cannot give a review. The shows last for approximately 6-7 hours and my coffee is still drinkable hot. The only problem with this glass lined thermos is that if you drop it or accidentally let it hit against a hard surface, the glass lining inside will shatter."
3,Not for the very elderly,"We got one of these so that my grandmother could pour herself a cup of coffee when she gets up at the crack of dawn. Unfortunately, this unit is not usable for her for two reasons: 1) The pump/button requires too much strength for her; and 2) There is a rotating ""switch"" on top that opens/closes the pour, and it is too easy to nudge that switch into the closed position. Her vision is not good, so she cannot tell why the pump does not work, nor how to open up the pour. She has given up trying to use this thermos. I think a lever-type pump mechanism will be better for her.Its ability to keep coffee hot is only so-so."
1,They're not what they used to be.,"Arrived promptly, kept coffee hot for maybe 2 days, then failed. The outside got hot and the coffee got cold. I've had 3 New Stanley products also fail this year - manufacturers - STOP making everything in China. Also, it cost half as much as the purchase to send this POS back for replacement, which will probably fail also. Buying a name brand like Thermos or Stanley used to mean you were purchasing quality. Now it's all crap."
1,Poor Insulation,Poor insulation compared to other brands used. Liquids are not hot after 18 hours. Other brands kept liquids hot for 36 hours.
4,Thermas Model PP1920M,"Thermos Model PP1920M 2 Quart Thermal Beverage DispenserI liked this item, good quality, but smaller then I expected, we use it a lot."
1,Big bang!,"Upon arrival, I rinsed the inside of the product with warm water and mild dish detergent as instructed. When warm water was poured in, the product exploded making a very loud popping noise. The glass inside was shattered into small pieces and some pieces were on the top of the opening area. I am so glad the glass did not get me or on the floor. I never thought a thermal pot could be this dangerous. I am going to pick a Zojirushi next time."
5,no pinching fingers,"I used to work at Carl's Jr. and serve coffee everyday from this thermos. We used this everyday. It's worth the price. I don't understand some lazy ass comments about pinching fingers, lol. It's just a thermos....not rocket science. It keeps the beverage hot for hours, believe me. I'm from Peru and over there we cannot afford gas heating up water every single time we want coffee or tea, believe or not, thermos is the brand of our choice."
2,Can't keep the hot things hot,This Thermos product needs to do one thing well. Keep hot things hot for a couple of hours. It doesn't. Luke warm coffee in less than two hours. I returned it. I'm sticking with Nissan Stainless products which work great.
2,Loses heat,"I'm disappointed. This thermos doesn't seem to keep coffee hot for very long. After a few hours, the coffee is just warm."
3,Keeps coffee hot but pump stopped working,"It keeps coffee hot a good while - longer if you pour hot water in it for a minute or so to heat it up before putting the coffee in.MY only complaint is that the pump started sticking - its crazy - the pump works if you prop the top open slightly, but if you close it, the pump sticks in the down position, and there's nothing to cause it as far as I can see. I still use it because it holds a day's worth of coffee - I just have to prop the top ajar to pump.Oh - and you CAN take the top off - open to 45 degrees and pull up."
2,Thermos Vacuum 2 qt Pot with Pump EXPLODED!!!,"i ordered this thermos to house my coffe during the work day. i had used it for about a week before one day when i was cleaning it, i cleaned yesterdays coffee out in the sink and waited for the coffe to stop brewing. there were no contents in the thermos. when the coffe stopped brewing i opened the top, and then, without any notice as i started to take the pumper outta the middle, it exploded and sounded like a gun shot! it sent the glass insulation all over the place and scared me!! i have tryed to contanct thermos to see if they have fixed this problem before i buy a new one, and they never wrote back so i bought a Stainless steel insulated thermos instead. BEWARE OF EXPLOSION, i have read on the internet that this has happend in the past..."
2,Thermos Review,"I made this purchase to replace one that belonged to someone else that I broke during my first use. Drinks stay plenty hot, but the pump, handle, hinge, and lid are very cheap plastic, poorly designed, and easily broken. I can only imagine how bad it would get damaged if dropped."
2,came broken,Not Happy - this item came broken and I had to quickly find another one to have it in time for christmas
5,thermos,i love my thermos i take it to work make my pot of coffee and go to my desk. don't have to get up to mess around getting coffee. really love it thank you so much
3,"Item works, but awful sticker","The item is great. Works as it should. Keeps coffee warm for hours. No complaints. But they took this really sweet nice looking stainless steel looking outer shell and put this gigantic sticker on it that wraps all the way around. No problem, right? Just peel it off. Guess what? It's really hard to peel off. I haven't' soaked it overnight yet, but simple soap and water doesn't cut it. You end up with pieces of glued on paper stuck all over the place. It was a terrible design decision for an otherwise nice functional device."
4,Case in point an excellent help,This book is really a helpful book to prepare for strategic consultants. It consists out of a helpful framework and worked out case examples. My advice is to buy this book and practice the cases with a friend to get the maximum result out of it.
3,"OK, but not enough","The book is good and well-written, but it falls short of preparing you for situations where you might be handed materials that you need to quickly review and incorporate in your case interview. This book is a good resource, but I wouldn't recommend it as your only one."
3,"average, but vault case guide is superior","In my opinion, this book was not really worth my time to read it or my money to buy it. There was very little in depth information on the case interview process. As superior guides to case interviews and consulting, I would recommend the Vault Guide to the Top 50 Consulting Firms and the Vault Guide to the Case Interview. (The latter two can apparently be downloaded directly from vault.com if needed immediately to prepare for an interview)"
2,Somewhat useful,"I found Case in Point to be somewhat useful, but also found the Vault Guide to Case Interview to have more practical tools - and more actual interview questions - for dealing with case interviews"
5,A very good start,I'll be working for Morgan next year and I really credit this book. I had only taken a couple finance classes two years ago so this was a nice refresher. It provides a great summary of all the equations and relationships that you need to memorize for i-banking interviews. Read it carefully but also stay up on your WSJ. You'll need to talk current events and not just formulas.
5,Good Start for the hellish I.B. interviews,"Some of the info in the book I learned at college, but it is a very useful guide. Most of the sample interview questions in the book are really asked in banking interviews. I recommend it to anyone applying for investment banking positions."
4,"Eh,alright-could be better...","This game I had recently received for a Christmas present,and now it's losing out to my other games.I began the game,and it was cute.The channels were creative and peppy,but didn't hold my intrest.This game is better suited to younger gamers and/or pokemaniacs.If you're a bit older,I recommend Animal Crossing,which is much more enjoyable."
4,POKEMON CHANNEL,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ITS WHERE YOU GO ON A QUSTE TO FIND TV CILPS FOR THE NEW TV SHOW POKEMON WITH PIKACHE AND 3 OF THE R&S; GAMES THE NEW HIDDEN POKEMON MIGHT MAKE AN APPERENCE...P.S. COMES WITH 3 E-READER CARDS
5,Pokemon Channel,This game is awesome! I have read lots of reviews on it and it looks really great. You are trying to get more things for your room as you go through 3d worlds and get news about whats happening! This game looks really challenging. You also can go on gameshows as you collect items for your room. You can also travel to different places for new information! This is a must get! It will be worth the money!
2,not that good,"this game was really short and pretty boring, i do not like it. i would not recommened this game to anyone."
1,this game is whack!(lame),"my brother got this cheap game from my neighborfor his b-day,and now it's collecting dust.I give this game no stars,because this just a cpoy of ""Hey you,pikachu""!"
4,"Not A+, but it still is fun!","Pokemon channel is very cute and fun to play. You get to watch TV, earn money, decorate your room, explore, and talk to other pokemon. Although the game is fun for awhile, it gets really boring after you beat it. It is a great game for the amount of money you pay for it, but it isn't the best."
3,"Good value, very STIFF!!!","Good value for the money, easy installation. The only drawback is how stiff the arm is when adjusting position."
4,Pricey but worth it -,"This is a great mount! With the right tools (drill, 1/2"" socket, pencil, level, stud finder), it goes up in 15 minutes! I own two of these mounts to use with Samsung 26"" and 32"" LCDs.It could sit closer to the wall, but I don't it's possible because of the position features of the mount. The cable management features of the mount leave a lot to be desired, but still an excellent flat panel mount. Mounting screws are mislabeled but you figure that out rather quickly."
4,Omnimount-CLM,"This is a good mount for the money. Installs very easily. Tends to bend a little from the weight of my 42 pound 32"" Lcd TV though. I don't think this can be helped. If you are concerned maybe buy the large model."
5,T.rex Tales Dinosaur Train,"Great video for kids. My 15 month old son loves it. The colors are great, the water looks almost real and the music keeps him dancing. What would we do without Mr the Conductor?Dinosaur Train: T.rex Tales"
1,Incorrectly sold,"This product is sold as a Schnauzer, but is really a Scottish Terrier. I felt cheated!"
5,Bring on the fruit and veggies!,"I recently prepared some grape juice the old-fashioned way...crush, cook, strain. Good but messy, a lot of straining, and the juice still had a lot of pulp. I saw a demonstration on YouTube using a ""juicer-steamer"". ""What a clever idea,"" I thought. I researched several brands on the web and found the best buy was on Amazon.com through Ritz Camera. It arrived 4 days after placing the order! Fast service and found the product to be everything it was advertised to be. Have already used it doing grapes, elderberries and apples. WONDERFUL! In 40 min. the pure juice started to flow, quickly filled all the jars, and I was done! Now I enjoy making juice and jellies. Makes a very messy and tedious job much more enjoyable. Have been bragging to family, friends and even strangers about my new ""toy."""
5,Magic jelly machine,"Why didn't someone think of this before? We've been able to make specialty jellies that would have been impossible by mushing product through a collander. We started out with crab apples. Add pectin, and voila. Then it was high bush cranberry crab apple jelly. Next, rose hip jelly and rose hip raspberry jelly. We plan to experiment with salmon berries, currants, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries.... you get the picture."
5,Great Product,"I actually haven't used the one I bought from Amazon, but my mother has and she loves it. She used to do grapes, etc the old way with that collander thing and some sort of pantyhose. This does the work in half the time and 1/10th the effort. I borrowed my neighbors that was just like this and it is AMAZING. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
5,Nutri Steamer/Juicer,"The juicer came through the mail quickly and without damage. Complete with instruction booklet and sample recipes. Great product, would do business again with this company - Jenny"
1,What ya get ain't what ya see,"Somewhere along the pipeline, someone pulled a fast one. I doubt it is the seller. The unit INSIDE the box is NOT the original Back to Basics Nutri-steamer that is shown on the OUTSIDE of the box. I HAD one of the originals until a house fire pretty well fried it.I used that SJ for all number of kitchen cooking/food prep. It WAS very versatile and I loved it. The one I received as a replacement - and sent back - was an inferior model. A big difference is the steamer basket will not fit down into the main pot to be used as solely a steamer pot. The stainless steel is NOT as heavy as the original nor as well made. The stock pot section does not appear as large.(Will boil dry sooner). So beware that what you are buying is NOT the same as what is shown. NOW....If I can only find one of the originals.......<sigh>"
4,Love it !,"My 4 year old daughter is obsessed with the solar system.. stars, planets etc. I looked at many telescopes and knew she would not be able to understand what she was seeing. This is perfect ! The slides are clear and fun to look at..it tells you about the slides and she is actually able to answer questions on the quiz. It is educational and fun. I would not recommend it for older kids."
5,Great First Telescope,Bought this telescope for my 5 year old grandson for his birthday. He loves it & really likes the talking parts of it. Loves learning about monkeys & all the other things on it. So glad I found this one!
5,PERFECT for my autistic nephew,"This toy got really bad reviews, so I was nervous, but it turned out to be PERFECT for a perfect kind of kid. It LOOKS LIKE A TOY. Don't go in thinking it's really hard science stuff you are doing here. it's a toy. it looks like a toy. But the things it has to say, the quizzes and info it says aloud--that part isn't particularly crafted for 5 year-olds. My nephew is a genius--he can tell me things about science (nature and space especially) I have never heard before. But he's still a very young child at heart--and the combination of Toy plus Science really made him happy. he was thrilled to open it, and I am sure will continue playing with it long after his birthday has worn off (which I can't say for sure about any of his other gifts.)"
2,silly and useless,"Playtime about 10minutes, cheaply made and very limited usefulness....$24 for 10 minutes?????Very disappointed in this productDon't waste your money"
4,Exactly what it looks like,"It's exactly what you are expecting. The material is a little thin so you will be able to see through it if you hang it up, but for mounting on a wall it's perfect."
4,MLB Oakland A's Flag,"MLB Oakland Athletics Flag nearly met my expectations. Good product at great value. Flag is high quality. Rings for hanging flag. Single sided. Would have preferred thicker material, double sided."
1,not made in USA - made in China,Boo - it's not made in the USA like it says on the website. Made in China right on the package. I feel duped.
4,Excellent ...a real page turner!!!,"I enjoyed this book very much! Pete Earley kept the pace going with his colorful descriptions of prison characters and the lives they lead. If you like HBO's OZ, you'll like this book. The only weakness I saw was there was little to no African-American representation of prison characters."
4,Interesting trip inside...,"The Hot House proved to be an interesting trip inside the federal corrections system with the opportunity to know some of the characters that play within this specialized, seldom seen society. For the casual observer well worth the time and the journey inside The Hot House."
4,Excellent account of life in prison,The author does a wonderful job of getting the prison population (both inmates and staff ! ) to talk to him. They seem to drop their guard (no pun intended) and level with him. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
3,Could be better,I felt the book started out fine and then became too sensational. It may well be it's dated too. I think the book Newjack is a better read and feels more authentic.
4,Interesting reading,"This is one good read about life inside Leavenworth prison. The (petty) politics of prison life, and the strange charachters who live and work behind bars are fully documented. Based throughout the author's period in ""The Hot House""."
5,"A mortifying, non-fiction account of life in prison.","You will NEVER forget this petrifying account of an author, living day in and day out with some of the most hardened criminals in the world. The intrigue is greatest when the cons show their softer sides (only to thrust into accounts of gutting other prisoners)."
2,Difficult to read,"I enjoy reading prison stories and I would have to say I found this to be the least enjoyable of all the books I have read. I found the story or stories to be difficult to follow. I have completed the book but the stories were so disjointed I really can't say what or who it was really about. Definitely not a favourite! If you are looking for a detalied , insightful account of life behind bars( the prison experience ) look elsewhere."
4,I Lived the hell within Leavenworths walls. The Catmans dead,"Overall the book was good, however there were many things in itthat were not fact although most were fact, many were not and theauthor was duped into believing certain things that were utterlybull. Not mentioned were the alliance between the Mexican Mafia andthe Aryan Brotherhood, yes they worked together on hits and drugswithin the walls as they do in all the Federal USP's. Overall the bookwas good. I lived for 72 month's within those red walls and to adjustto freedom after release was difficult. There are many con's insideLeavenworth that never want to be free. That was not me, I wanted myfreedom and I got it."
5,The book is great,"If you like books on non-fiction crime or just crime in general, you should get this book. I think it got a lot of press when it came out, as it should have. I read this book a couple of years ago after hearing the author on the radio. I flew through it. Earley doesn't miss a beat on what it's really like to be in a serious prison like Leavenworth. From the guards to the prisoners, to the administrators and Federal Bureau of Prisons, you get it all. I mean it's probably 1 of 4 books I really enjoyed the last 5 or 6 years of reading. You just learn a lot in this about this parallel universe of criminals and the men and women who have to warehouse these guys. I haven't read anything else from the author but I should because I enjoyed this book so much. So you love true crime? Then you should find out what happens to those guys after their convictions, it's just a real solid cool book. Get it."
5,Midnight Whispers is so touching!,"I really love V.C. Andrews books!! In this book I cried so much when they died, and it was almost so I could kill her cousins for being so insensitive!! It is one of the best books I ever read! As good as Virginia Andrews other books!!!!"
4,The saga continues,"This book was probably my least favorite in the Dawn Cutler series, however it was still decent.It was fun to see Dawn's daughter go back to the places Dawn visited, meet the people she met- to see what had happened since. It was also fun to see ""new"" characters take on the evil role. However, something just didn't click for me in this book as it did in the others. Maybe it was just that Dawn wasn't present for most of the book.I'd recommend this series though as a whole if you enjoy VC Andrews or if you enjoy books of this genre."
5,one of my favorites,i have to say ive read the cutler seris the doll seris and now im reading the casteel seris the cutler seris is my favorite so far and this book is my favorite by far but isnt it kind of preverted that christie makes out with her step uncle? i mean that isnt as bad as philip and dawn but still well im not going to be one of the those reviewers who tells you everything because then it ruins the book. i think whoever writes these since V.C Andrews is dead shouldnt just stop a seris like that i want to know what happens with christie and gavin and if things get better for christie and jefferson at home same thing with the doll seris but thats for another reveiw
3,3.5 stars...,"I was not happy that this book killed off Dawn and Jimmy so fast. Made the book a little more difficult to get into. FITA and the Heaven series 4th books were more engaging that this one. I love the Cutler series, but I didn't really enjoy it as much from Christie's perspective as I enjoyed Bart's in FITA. this book was good, but definitely not my favorite. I'm glad I read it since it is part of the series."
3,It was ok.,"Not the best out of her series. I really couldn't stand the fact that they were treating Jefferson like he was five instead of nine. A nine year old is capable of dressing and bathing himself. Actually, most kids I know at that age are beginning to get modest. But in this story they carry him around and dress him like he is five.I also wish they would cut out on the rape stuff. Philip was one of my favourite characters and than they had to go and make him rape Christie."
3,So-so,"I enjoyed the first book in the Cutler series, but later in the 4th & 5th books, it seemed very similar to the Casteel series. When I read this book espicially, I had felt like I was reading the Casteel series all over again. It is a good book, but also very familiar."
5,forgotten cookies,"I love this cookbook because it has all those old fashion cookie recipes that are long lost. Even if you never make the cookies, you will enjoy reading them."
2,disappaointed,The book is a holiday cookie recipe book and has a lot of recipes but no pictures. the first thing I look for in a cookie book is what the finished product will look like on a plate. so was very disappointed there are NO pictures.
1,doesn't do anything,"I have used it since my older model broke and I couldn't find a replacement. Frankly, this model releases a audible sound that banished humans. Its not worth a cent for this junk to keep up your space."
1,Somebody stop this guy,"I thought I was in for something interesting, judging by the description. What I got was a book in need of an editor. This book also contained jumbled half-thoughts that were hard to follow, and a plot as thin as wax paper.If you like amateur hour, this weak attempt at literature might work for you. But I prefer good writing, substance, a strong plot, and well defined objectives. That's what real literature is all about.Until the author learns to write, he is simply embarressing himself by self-publishing this nonsense."
2,Disappointing,"Of interest mainly as a reference source, but a risk for the casual reader. Each of the 125 entries contains a summary of the film's context, a sketch of the censorship travails, and a brief bibliography -- encompassing on the average, one to three pages for each entry. Considering the subject-matter, the discussion style remains curiously colorless and detached. Despite the suggestive title, there's clearly no exploitation of the contents. And yet, the text could use some pepping up -- well-chosen photographs would have helped. Moreover, there's no apparent logic behind the films chosen for inclusion, no particular point to the ""sampling"", and since many of the entries are obscure to the average film-goer, its value as a reference is restricted. Nonetheless, for someone wanting an easily encompassed glimpse of film censorship world-wide, the book may fit the bill."
4,Killer Piano,"Very interesting for all JLL fans; shows some live footage, but also demonstrates JLL's style of piano playing and gives some insight into his career/family stories, told by JLL/his sister/daughter/and buddies. Recorded approx. 2006/2007"
1,i hate this book,"A small sampling of banal one-liners offered as insightful nuggets of wisdom. It's one of those books where each page contains nothing more than a single sentence fragment. It looks like the Fallons threw some loose napkin scrawls together. Now I know why the online sample pages were not available: it's a rip-off. Try Pratt's ""You Are Worthless"" for a truly witty and perversely uplifting look at life."
1,Boring,"Not funny and I so wanted to laugh. A waste of money as just a so-called pessimistic slant on self help books. Should have been a lot better in order to reach the stage of publishing and book tour, but I guess those who actually enjoy Chicken Soup and so on might be daft enough to find this type of humor funny. Must be Jay Leno devotees. Would give this away as stocking stuffer, but embarrassed to as not representative of me or anything I find amusing."
