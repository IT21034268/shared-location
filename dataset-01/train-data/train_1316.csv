5,Said Chraibi- La clef de Grenade,"As an aficionado of the 'Ud and a player of the Middle eastern flute, the Nay, I have collected many classic recordings of udists including hte masters of the 20th century such as Farid al-atrash. This recording is simply wonderful not only in the fabulous playing and advernturous interptretations of Said Chraibi but also in the technical aspects of the recording. A must purchase for lovers of Arabic music.Dr. Juan v. De la SierraSarasota FL"

2,did he really do sex with his own daughter?,"I read this book twenty-five years ago. I enjoyed it, but have since given it away, and no longer have access to it. It is a haunting, mesmerizing tale of lost and found self. The only thing that continues to nag at my conscience is the notion of him finding his wife, and then his daughter, whom he finally has sex with. They are about the same age in this scenario, but there is something really lewd about that aspect of the story. For that reason, I wanted nothing further to do with the book, and ultimately gave it away. The movie was equally repulsive in regards to the incest element. Without that aspect, it would have been a fun read and a funner movie. I noticed in one of the above reviews, someone referred to it as non-fiction. Excuse me! Shamey Mr. Author"
2,Enthralling page turner that dissapoints in the end,"Hmm... interesting about this book.. As i started reading it, it really intrigued me, and i could not for the life of it put it down.. I was engrossed in the story and the characters will to find out and defuse his current situation.. However, it dissapointed me to the fact that as i got later on into the book, in the last several chapters, it had started to get predictable, and finally the last 2 or 3 chapters were obvious in what was going to happen.. My rating for this book would be 3 1/2 stars for the first 3 quarters of the book and 1 star for the last quarter of it. On top of the ending being predictable, it wasnt entertaining... i could of really done without reading this novel."
1,Simplistic,"I really can't believe this book got published. The writing is just as simplistic as the flow of the story. The transitions are lean and need more explanation. For example, at one point we have Peter totally enthralled with finding more about his reincarnation. Then he is ready to toss the towel and go home. The only link that connects both situations is a brief mention that he had been canvassing neighborhoods for six days, with no luck. To go from one extreme to the next, you need to ellaborate a little more!I wouldn't be surprised if the movie happened to be better than this book!"
1,i can't give this more,i only watched 15 - 20 minutes and i hated this movie with a passion. not even for Drew Berrymore fans.
3,Is it good?,"My Granddaughter is 15 and wants this movie. She said that she's seen it before and that it is a lot like ""The Crush"" with Cary Elwes and Alicia Silverstone. Should I let her get it? I need a quick answer!"
1,The Product has not reached me yet,This is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet. I request you to do the needful.Thanking youPrince George
3,2 great performances in this movie!!,I just watched this movie with great reluctance as it started thinking to myself oh gosh a stupid teenage type movie...........................BUT was I in for a shocker...........I must say Drew Barrymore and Mellissa gilbert gave fine performances in this and Drew Barrymore was spectacular as this character and I must say she is indeed a great actress. Her performance in this was stellar and brilliant to say the least. She played this so well it blew my mind. Although I was not a real fan of the story itself I just liked how she played this character. She is a fine actress indeed. Mellissa Gilbert was excellent in her portrayal of the character in this movie too and I am of a new opinion of her fine acting since Roseanne. Well done to both of these great young actresses. A somewhat disturbing scenario of a movie and it's content but I enjoyed the acting overall. A good movie for Drew Barrymore fans.----------
4,Barrymore's comeback begins here!,"This erotic thriller from the late '90s can be attributed to staging Drew Barrymore's comeback from hellraising tabloid staple to a formidable actress that captivates audiences. Barrymore plays Ivy, a girl from the wrong side of that tracks who has Lolita-esque ways of getting what she wants. Sara Gilbert (""Roseanne"") plays an awkward teen from a rich family who makes the mistake of befriending Ivy and falls victim to her machinations. Tom Skerritt and Cheryl Ladd play the rich parents who also get drawn into Ivy's web of deceit. The film is predictable, you know what's going to happen when Ivy displays her limber body in front of the rich dad, but Barrymore's performance provides the film's heat and demonstrates a turning point in Barrymore's career of her talent actually carrying some weight."
4,Posion Ivy on DVD,"The first of the ""Poison Ivy"" movies, were DrewBarrymore shines in her role as Ivy. New Line did it again this is agreat DVD it has the unrated and the R-rated versions of the movie and both in Full Screen and Widescreen versions. Othere than that and the Original trailer there is nothing intresting in the DVD. Some Commentary would have been great but I guess you don't get everything in life. If you like Drew Barrymore then Buy it its great.(took off one start 'cuse there is no Commentary)"
4,A Deadly Friend,"Sara Gilbert (from TV's ""Roseanne"") plays Cooper, a lonley teenager who befriends the new wild girl in school, Ivy, (Drew Barrymore). The two become best friends and Ivy eventually moves in with her. But Ivy isnt what she seems to be. Her sweet personality is only a mask covering her darker, evil side. Ivy has a plan to throw their friendship away and destroy Cooper's life. She starts by seducing her father, murdering her mother, and literally stealing Cooper's life from her. Once Cooper realizes whats shes up to, she tells her to get lost. But Ivy isnt about to go anywhere. An Edge Of The Seat Thriller!"
2,"Typical B movie, well acted but stupid plot","Don't watch it for the plot. Overall, there is little characterization other than the two main actresses. If you're lookign for an erotic movie, there is too much violence and not enough sex. Its true, Sara Gilbert and Drew Barrymore act well in this, and if you are a Drew fan this may be worth watching. I saw the rated version of this."
1,Isn't It Sad To See Perfectly Good Blank Film Abused This Way?,"This is a bad movie.A really bad movie.No, I mean it, a really, really bad movie. It's so horrendous you could punish your kids by making them sit through it.All I can figure is someone went to Sara Gilbert and said, ""Hey, how'd you like to make the leap from sit-com to film?"" Then that same someone went and promised Tom Skerritt a lot of money to appear as a TMJ suffering sexually sicko father. And of course aging '70's starlet Cheryl Ladd did the film because she'd been out of the limelight a while, and then that leaves Drew Barrymore, who more or less played herself in those wilderness years of her career.Poison Ivy stinks. If there's ever a choice between seeing it or scrubbing the bathroom tiles, take the more enjoyable option and scrub those tiles till they shine!"
2,Big disappointment,After reading many reviews I thought that I will be seeing a movie similar or even better to the Poison Ivy - The New Seduction!MAJOR disappointment!!!!!The story Is interesting and on the paired but the body shots that make Poison Ivy - The New Seduction a great movie are completely missing.So if you want to see Drew Barrymore in her true beauty then this is not the movie.Poison Ivy - The New Seduction
2,NOT A MASTERPIECE !,"Why do you want to watch this movie ? To see the legs and bottom of Drew Barrymore or because you want to have a great time watching your TV ? If it's for the second solution, just for get it ! For all Drew fans, go for it. She's young, she is sexy, and well it's maybe enough. The acting is not bad. The curiosity is Cheryl Ladd was the Charlie's Angels Blondie for quite a longtime and everybody knows who Drew became these recent years ;) About the movie, well Not much to say and it's the major problem to it.It will look like the movie is damn too long ! Sara Gilbert (the little daughter of Roseanne if you remember) is great."
5,Drew is HOT!,Good movie that has a great scene...the very sexy and erotic scene of Ivy driving the Vette and the fetish shots of her working the pedals wearing toe cleavage stiletto pumps is sexually stimulating!
3,entertaining,"This movie wasn't oscar worthy. However, Sara Gilbert and Drew have a definate chemistry between them. Tom Skerritt is so creepy in this one. Definately not his alter ego from Picket Fences. The setting is cool. The house is great. Overall it's worth seeing."
2,Another forgetable film,"Well the premise sounded good but in the end it was nothing more then a snooze fest. All the actors were good in their roles such as they were but it lacked any true suspense or story to keep my interest. You pretty much knew what was going to hapenin but I kept waiting for something more; a shocking revelation or some twist in the plot. After an hour, I started counting the minutes till the ending. . I even felt sorry for the father who had to pay such a heavy price for a few good rolls in the hay. Moral of the story, don't get involved with your kid's friends,it might kill you. I also thoght Cheryl Ladd's character was nothing but a joke."
2,Below-average,"The only real good thing about the movie was it's well-cast characters, good performances, and the sex(which you can find more intriguing in Basic Instinct). Otherwise it contains extremely unappealing character(especially Skerrit, who starts to make love to Ivy even when he knows his daughter's in the hospital and even when his wife is dead;I wished Gilbert would have pushed him out the window) and silliness sink it deeply. Not much plot as well, with the familiar who's-sleeping-with-who melodrama. Ther is some character development, but it's also mean-spirited."
3,Avoid - get the ZBT pack instead for entry level,"Zildjian is (and long has been) my cymbal of choice. I typically use the Avedis line (A series), but do have some ZBT cymbals too. I gave this Planet Z pack a try and was shocked at how poorly they sounded and how cheaply they were made.If you are a loyal Zildjian fan and are either looking for an entry-level set of Zildjian cymbals, or are on a budget, spend the minor difference in price and get the Zildjian ZBT Basic I Cymbal Set (ASIN B0002ZO3L0) instead. Although the ZBT line is not up to the same level as Zildjian's A or K series, they are a quantum leap over the Planet Z series."
4,A wonderfully clever comic thriller,"Deathtrap is a truly underrated thriller. While it starts off slow considering most audience standards, it quickly dissolves into a clever, suspenseful, and ingenious comedy thriller. While the first act fares better than the second, the film is fun throughout, taking the audience on a ride of ""Who is working against whom and why?"" While not always surprising, it's an engrossing little puzzle to try and figure out, and the climax is a suspenseful nail biter. Ira Levin has brought us some true classics (The Stepford Wives, Rosemary's Baby) and this should be among them. It is a twisted good time. Highly recommended to mystery fans."
4,Quite excellent,"Ira Levin's comical mystery ""who'll do it"" is a joy from start to finish. Michael Caine is excellent as the mystery playwright who'd kill for a hit play. Christopher Reeve matches him all the way as the former student who's just written such a play. Dyan Cannon is amusing as Caine's overly hysterical wife.While the plot has more twists and turns than you'd like to count, it's all energetically made and well acted and just when you think you've figured it out...guess again.I'd like to recommend to future buyers to also purchase the wonderful play by Ira Levin. In fact, the only complaint I have with the film is that it didn't use the hilarious ending from the play.Deathtrap may not be as good as Sleuth but you'll have a heck of a time with it nonetheless."
4,Stage world adapted to cinema,"There have been many attempts to adapt stage hits to the cinema medium. Deathtrap is so successful in adhereing to the Aristotelian limits of time and space. The small cast is perfect. Christopher Reeve introduces the fact of being gay with very subtle body language, a fact which soon becomes a major complication in the plot. The twists and turns keep the viewer involved but not too confused, up to the catharsis of the ending. Masterfully done."
1,Would not stream.,"During 48hr.rental period,movie would not properly play.Waste of money.I am extremely disappointed with the Amazon streamig quality and dependability of viewing experience."
2,More twists and turns than a snake in a pea patch!,"For a Michael Caine (a most excellent and accomplished actor) film, I personally found ""Deathtrap"" to be a major disappointment. The story itself is so convoluted it's hard to follow. Caine's performance is probably as much as could be expected, considering what he was given to work with, as is that of Christopher Reeve. However, poor Dyan Cannon, saddled with some of the worst dialogue ever produced in front of a camera, went even further than would have been necessary in portraying a hysterical, overly-dramatic female.Instead of viewing ""Deathtrap"" as an interesting whodunit, I found it to be one of the most tiresome, dishonest films I've seen since, well, maybe since ""ever."""
1,What Happined?,"I saw this play live over in Austin and loved it! It was funney and was very good. Then I bought the movie, and I wanted to burn it! They got everything WRONG! They changed the begining, thay changed the ending when thay had a perfect beging and RELLY funny ending! The beging I could deal with but then the ending, I just didn't see the point in it. And the actress for the wife is HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! This movie version is a wast of tome and money! If you are lucky enough to see it live, keep the memories and don't buy the movie unless you want to be as dissipointed as I am. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!"
4,Deathtrap | Blu-ray,"Film looked greatAudio was mono but easily the best I've ever seen it.Warner did a good job. Not reference quality or anything...we aren't talking ""Samsara"" here....but damn good for a 1982 treasure.No spots. Film grain was apparent so no scrubbing digitally....sharp with honest & consistent color."
5,Watches,"Lightweight, comfortable, accurate, and outstanding timeless style, Skagen will be my choice for watches for a very long time!"
4,Minimalist beauty,"Very nice clean, minimalist watch.It would be better without the seconds hand, which is actually quite loud.Wouldn't know you were wearing otherwise as it is so light."
1,not happy,"Besides the fact that the date display is extremely small and hard to read, the watch stopped working after six months and I threw it away. Yes, I did have a new battery put in before throwing it away."
5,Better than the Bible ...,"It's not easy to delve into the mysteries of being human in the 21st century, but this book comes as close as any I've read, including the obfuscating New and Old Testaments. This book fortunately doesn't attempt to answer all your questions about the meaning of life, but it does ask thought-provoking questions. Read it with an open mind, and read it more than once to catch all the nuance. By the second read, you'll start to re-examine your own life."
5,A sweet little treasure.,"The characters and events not only stirred the sweet memories of my own childhood, but liberated me from the distortions of those early impressions. I suspect there is much more to this book than I was able to pick-up on the first read. Thank you!"
2,Don't Waste Your Hard-Earned Money,"I typically love books with spiritual messages and themes, but I found ""The Golden Frog"" to be a particularly obvious attempt to promote the author's own spiritual belief system.""Nathanial"", who is a loosely disguised version of the author himself, comes across as somewhat pompous and self-congratulatory. Overall, it was a hard book to read, not very well written. A good editor might be able to clean up and make it more effective, but I can't recommend it at this point."
1,12368 natuical chart,what is the size of chart? I have not purchased this material and there is very little information about it.
5,An Essential Read for All Gettysburg Fans,"Edward Longacre's _The Cavalry at Gettysburg_ continues to deserve an honored place at the top of the Gettysburg canon, which is saying a lot considering how much has been published on America's most written-about battle. This is one of Longacre's earliest books, but it still ranks as one of his best. The volume is exhaustively researched and well written. Longacre excels in his pithy character sketches of the opposing commanders, and his battle descriptions sometimes approach the poetic. This book sets the Battle of Gettysburg in a wider context, which helps us to better understand both what caused it and its outcome. Finally, Longacre ended up teaching me many things about a subject I thought I already knew a lot about."
5,"Handy, Thorough, and Entertaining","Longacre has done a splendid job of researching and presenting a reasonably objective and thorough depiction of the role of the cavalry in the Battle of Gettysburg. The first half of the book discusses all of the key events leading up to cavalry's activities at Gettysburg, including earlier battles. His inclusion of a list of commanding officers broken down to the regimental level is a handy reference aid, and his index is very thorough, so those who are primarily interested in the role of one officer or one regiment can quickly find the portions of the book which relate to that officer/regiment. His detailed footnotes and bibliography are also extremely useful, as are the numerous photographs and battle diagrams. And his entertaining prose takes you right into the action and into the minds of the key officers."
3,Visor clip,I had to return this item because it did not fit my radar detector. It would have been a good item if it had fit.
2,I wouldn't get this again,"Very stiff spring. It pops free of the radar detector easily, which can be good and bad, mostly bad, because it pops out when you don't want it to. Once it is attached to the detector, it's a two-handed wrestling match to get it attached to the visor."
5,clip,just a clip but works well. exactly what i expected and wanted. very tight spring will never come loose by accident
1,does not work,the detector i bought does not fit on the clip. Sold as it would and no goodEscort 57-000027 Visor Clip Mount for Radar and Laser Detectors
1,Not standard,This clip doesnt fit my Cobra Radar. The dimensions are not for every GPS; it should specify the brands this clip supports.
4,Dissatisfied customer,"The product was as expected. Worked perfectly for the application. However, the method of recieving this item was the pits, as is the trend of ordering things on line these days. More and more vendors are shipping by UPS Basic which the customer is charged. Unfortunately UPS basic ships to the closest post office to the address requested. Then after floating around in the postal system for 2-3 weeks because the post office doesn't deliver to the address originally assigned, you then pay a postage due on the item again, which doubles shipping charges, pisses off the customer, and often results in refusing delivery of the item."
3,never got the clip,"I'm giving it a 3 star because I think it would have done the job, however I may never know. Beach Camera, whom I ordered it from sent me the wrong item and I got stuck paying the shipping to send it back when it was clearly their error. I'm done with Beach Camera. Maybe I'll try ordering it again someday from someplace else."
2,Too expensive,This is just a bent piece of metal. It should not be more than 25 cents but they are charging five dollars. I am in wrong business or may be I have conscience. Otherwise it does cling to the visor. Later on I found out that I can do that with couple of strong rubber bands (which costs less than a cent). Old unused velcro is another option.
1,visor clip mount for radar and laser detectors,This clip is totally useless. It does not fit on my laser detector and it was a waste of money.
1,Waste of money.,"Don't waste your money, buy the suction cups. Besides the radars come with mounts. You will understand after you read the book that comes with the radar. Using the visor would be a bad step for the radar."
1,Garbage. Avoid,"This clip does not work. Do not buy, it is a waste of money. The lock does not engage, the detector falls off easily."
2,Awkward,"I bought this because original mount with suction cups lost it's suction. The mount points the detector in a downward position, because my visor is locked in that position (I have a Toyota Corolla)... I wouldn't recommend buying this mount because of what I mentioned, and because Escort recommends that you mount low for laser (because laser is typically aimed at your license plate) which is more common than radar, and high for radar... I like the X50, it saved me twice (before the LEO was visible) on a six hour drive recently."
1,"Not properly ""packaged""","When I purchased the Whistler 440, this was ""recommended"" to be packaged with the purchase of that item. When I received it, the unit was too wide to fit into the Whistler mount opening so I am returning it for a refund. The return slip indicates I am responsible for return shipping, but I am hoping with further explanation, they will refund this as well, realizing that they have marketed this item incorrectly. I have had nothing but great experiences with Amazon so am confident they will make this right."
4,Exactly as described,"There isn't really much to say about a formed piece of metal, but I ordered this to replace a lost clip for my garage door opener and it works perfect. I used some epoxy to glue it to my garage door opener and it has stayed in place for many months already. It has a nice tight grip on my visor and has never fallen off. I'd definitely order it again if I needed another clip. Simple, great product."
1,Does not fit COBRA radar detector !!! WHY sell it? Worth about $1 and I paid $10. WOW !!!!,"IT WAS LABELED FOR COBRA, not escort !!!!!I purchased this with a COBRA xrs 9770g. They both arrived together. It does NOT FIT the slot on the unit, its much wider. I did take a dremel and cut the metal bands down and forced it in, and it really does not lock in place right, but I already damaged it.DONT ORDER FOR COBRA 9770G and possibly, from other reviews it does not fit other COBRA detectors either. CALL and confirm from someone that it fits your model cobra. THIS IS probably for older models?WHY does AMAZON not state WHAT COBRA models this fits??? Others returned it, I cut it with a dremel and forced it to fit, and its not perfect.Oh, by the way, its a clip worth about a dollar, and I paid about $10 for it !!!!!"
1,Wrong size,I bought this clip because it was supposedly bought together as a set according to amazon but it does not even fit my radar detector. They are not even compatible
1,Not worth it.,I would pass on this and purchase the suction cup mount instead. This holds the unit at the wrong angle and depending on your visor location it may be above the window so the receptors on the detector are covered.
1,Does not work with my Cobra.,Amazon lists this as something people buy with the Cobra iRadar but it is not compatible in the slightest. Probably fine with some other devices.
1,Radar Clip,"Worthless. The slot you see needs to go into the top of the radar detector. The Detector needs a clear view out the back window to see approaching radar, which is impossible unless your sun visor is completely horizonal and angled in a way that allows it to see out the back window."
1,"cheap,cheap","this clip didnt even fit my laser detector. it should not even be associated with laser detector,it's not like one size fits all. i ended up using velcro for attachement snd the paint came off the clip. go figure,its a piece of crap. dont buy!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,Just buy a blendmount if you want your detector mounted off the windshield. Escort.com sells them with the mirror power tap free.
4,Perfect for mounting above rear view mirror,"This is exactly what I wanted - no wires, nothing on the dash, and yet still readable and reachable.I use this clip to mount a Passport Solo above the rear view mirror in an Audi. If your vehicle has a little ""mini shade"" above the mirror it clips there perfectly. I found that clipping it on the driver's visor was too distracting - it makes the detector too close to your eyes to comfortably read it while driving.Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that it should have been in the detector package ($4 is a ripoff for a little bit of metal), and that since the rear laser detector is on the top of a solo this way of mounting disables it."
1,Does not fit the Whistler,Don't waste your money buying this with the Whistler. It does not fit the Whistler and it's not worth packing it up and sending it back since return shipping and my time is worth more than $11.00. Amazon should test items before combining them to be sure they are compatible. I will not trust them in the future about this after this experience. The Whister comes with a windshield mount so you don't need to order another one- which they also recommend. Don't get taken like me.
1,Worthless,"I was really hoping that this would solve the problem I have in the winter time (detector falling off from the windshield) but unfortunately it turned out to be a piece of junk. I agree with one of the previous reviewers that this can leave a permanent mark on your visor. It also eliminates the detection of laser (at least laser coming from behind since the sensor is usually on top of the detector). I saw a radar detector mount that you place on your dash, perhaps that works better?"
3,Read before you buy,"Altho the clip is generally better than the suction cups way of mounting this, its not necessarily good for the escort. The Escort has a nifty GPS function in here that needs to be in a open area. For the GPS to work properly, it has to have full access of the Open windshield. Altho having it on the visor will still enable the GPS, it will be very spotty and inaccurate coverage. Buy this sorely on your own needs and wants, or, if you can live without the GPS."
1,Would not consider in the future,"Received the visor clip quickly but when I took the sticker off of it, part of the paint on the clip came off ... for what I spent on it, it is not worth returning. I have decided not to use it, I think it is too tight against the visor and may cause damage to the visor."
4,Nice case at a bargain price,"The case was slightly disappointing because it had no crystal or lense over the display, easily the most vulnerable part of the iPod Nano. The case also lacked a means to attach it to a belt, laynyard, or whatever. Yet for under $8.00, I'd be hard pressed to find a better case. The case seems reasonably sturdy, and being aircraft aluminium, possible modifications to overcome the minor deficiencies should be pretty straight forward. I already am looking about my collections of junk for a bit of perspex to fashion a display cover for the hole at the top of the case, and I like lanyard type suspension methods because of my minimal belt space when carrying my cell phone, PDA, keyrings, etc. all at once, so I will likely attach a method for suspending the device and case thusly."
5,A good resource....,One of the few works in English that explores this amazing spiritual tradition. Definately worth the price!
4,Should be named the History of the Greece,"I expected this DVD to be about Sparta, but it dealt with the whole Greek civilization when Sparta was at its peak. It was three different programs; each an hour in length. An excellent review of Greece and their individual thought concepts regarding public life, sex, treatment of women, slaves and war. Well worth watching, but I did not add it to my personal DVD library."
1,Closed captioning...FAIL,The video is supposed to be closed captioned but it is not. I have a Panasonic ST50 tv and panasonic blu ray player but there is no option for closed captioning and turning it on through the tv does nothing. I have no idea what the lady is talking about without it. FAIL.
4,Nice but one problem....,"This costume was well-made and nice looking, my 10 year old son really liked it. Was delivered on time. The only problem with it was the belt that goes around the waist to hold the costume together was too SMALL, and without it the costume doesn't come together. Just be prepared to find something to accommodate. Other than that, really liked it."
3,Just Okay,"I bought this for my son for Halloween. I was so excited because it was so neat looking in the picture. When I got it, it wasn't as good as it looked in the picture. It is not leather, it's polyesther and cheaper materials. My son still loves this costume, but I was expecting a better product. I could have gotten something similar at WalMart for cheaper."
3,Ninja Costume,"Really quite thin. But,it served it's purpose which was a night of trick or treating. Sizing seemed to be accurate."
1,Don't even bother with this one.,I thought that this would be better quality. It was very disappointing. It is made like the cheap one time wear costumes from Walmart that you get for Halloween. It also ran small. I would have to go up 2 sizes to get a descent fit.
1,Didn't use it,"Very poor product. Another product that is not the same as the advertised item. The undergarment is very flimsy, the armor, which appears to be of good quality in the picture, is certainly not quality and is permanently creased and not ironable. The shoulder pads have a crease through the top of the shoulder and look terrible. The wrist and ankle pads are much smaller than you see in the picture and the straps are paper-thin plastic.My 9 year old son refused to wear it."
2,This was way too small for my 10 year old.,"I ordered this in the largest size they offered. A child's large. It was skin tight on my 10 year old son and the pants and sleeves were too short. Don't be fooled, this is more like a child's small/medium."
4,Ekco Steak Knives,We were in need of some new steak knife sized knives. These appeared to be rugged as well as attractive and reasonably priced. Ekco is a long known name in kitchen accesories.
3,Sad Melodies,"Spa by composer Hennie Bekker is skillfully crafted, and indeed is the kind of music you may hear when getting a massage at a spa. Although there are only six tracks, they comprise over fifty minutes of music. I love the titles of the tracks: Comfort, Euphoria, Inner Peace, Revitalized. However, some of the tracks actually have a tragic quality to them. They sound like a sad movie soundtrack. It really evokes somone crying and having experienced a loss rather than all the wonderful things that could be evoked, such as the ocean. The CD has ended up depressing me more than relaxing or revitalizing me."
5,Amazing for use alongside other therapies or alone for relaxation,"This CD was used on a hypnotherapy course I attended and ever since I have been trying to get hold of it. Great for use both alone as its very relaxing and freeing, but also with other therapies. I highly recommend it."
3,not so famous,she writes better than this. this book dragged for more pages than it should have.Carol kulowski
4,Just as promised.,If you love the Mallory books you will enjoy this one. It arrived quickly and in very good condition.
5,Another Mallory great one...,Carol O'connell writes another terrific Mallory story. She has to follow the clues before the last juror is dead.
3,"3.5 stars - love her writing, but not this book.","This is a tough book for me to rate. Mallory is a fascinating character and we learn even more about her past. But this is not at all the usual mystery. Mallory is almost a secondary player to other strange and, in their own ways, haunted characters. My reaction reminds me a bit of the way I felt about Lehane's ""Shelter Island,"" in that I'm not certain I can say I loved the story, but I absolutely love her writing."
5,A compelling audio selection,"As an avid reader of audiobooks, I am always on the lookout for new titles that can hold my attention while I am doing other things. This is certainly one of them! This unabridged reading was fantastic and stimulating. The narrator did a good job of increasing the level of suspense throughout. For all you Mallory fans- consider this one."
3,Just OK,"My daughter loves airplanes, so I thought she would love this. She ""flies"" it around for a while making her own sound effects, and likes to pull the people in and out. However, it will only occupy her time for a minute or two until she moves on to her next toy. The luggage in the rear is a neat idea, but the door opens very easily when you put the plane in a ""takeoff"" angle, leaving the luggage behind. The built in sounds are annoying, and very repetitive, but it does have an off switch."
5,The apex of a career in woodcut storytelling,"Lynd Ward hits his stride in this masterpiece! All graphic novel artists owe a debt of gratitude to Ward, particularly the work done in Vertigo."
3,Great for folks just starting out.,This book will tell the newcomer all the basics and touches upon the economics in a non-technical manner.The book is a good source for adults and teens.Ron Parker has done a good job simplifying technical jargon so the novice has a chance to avoid pestering other shepherds with strange questions.
1,Unreliable Portable Drive,"I purchased this portable drive for two reasons [1] to backup my desktop files, and [2] to transfer files from my desktop to my laptop.The drive worked once, allowing me to copy all my data files (about 35GB) from my desktop (to the portable drive). Now I can't get this thing to power up, regardless of whether I use a single USB 2.0 port or single USB 1.0 port connection, or use the ""Y"" USB cable that comes with it to draw power from two source USB connections. My desktop is an older DELL desktop, but my laptop is a gaming XPS DELL. I can't get this thing to power up on either machine. This thing is a huge disappointment. I should have gone with another IOMEGA portable - at least that one never failed and powers up ever time!"
5,may be best album ever recorded!!,Monica has done a marvelous job demonstrating her vocal skills. Anyone who likes great music sung from the heart will enjoy this album. You don't need to know Spanish to enjoy it.
4,Great Late night Sci-Fi,A very well made sci-fi movie of late night tv. If your into horror/sci-fi and love the late night films that were shown during your favorite horror host(s).. then this movie will be very good in your DVD collection. Recommended!
4,b dosen't always stand for boob....,"this is a real b movie..made in the 60's(i think)..it's a Japaneses,spy movie,wit our Japaneses,""james bond""..go's after a mad scientist,who wants to make men into slave fish..(mermen?)..with his American girlfriend..who's pretty cute..they go after the mad man..and after 90 fun filled min.,foil his plot(while almost getting turned into tuna themselves)..there's lots of corny action,radiation, and a whole underwater city to see(i was hoping to see Godzilla,but no such luck)..so if you like the b's..this ""b"" the movie to see..."
2,"The ""Jurassic Park"" of it's time!","Just kidding. This qualifies as a ""so bad it is good"" film. Low budget, bad acting, dopey dialogue, dreadful special effects, and ridiculous plot, all conspire to make this a truly awful movie."
2,Back In The Day...,"I think I saw this one twice back in the day. The first time, I saw a scene where Peggy Neal's character screamed and fainted as one of the fishmen moved toward her, and then placed her on a table, intending to make her one of them. The second time, my legs trembled during the opening titles. When they got to the part where Dr. Moore told Ken and Jenny about the water cyborgs, I turned it off. That was scary enough for me."
5,Great for the price!,"I bought the Lexibook America Organizer for my 11 year old son. Being in sixth grade, homework expectations have been kicked up a notch from elementary school. His penmanship isn't the best...this discourages him from writing of any sort. He loves the computer and typing, electronic gadgets of any kind, so I hoped this organizer would be an incentive to keep better track of his homework assignments. It worked!!! He loves typing in the scheduler, and he sets the alarm to remind himself that it's homework time! The built in radio has proved useful as entertainment on the bus ride home. I, as a parent, am very pleased with this product!"
3,Great for basics but could have a little more,"I did not want a book that I needed a MBA degree to understand but this was a tad bit more watered down that I expected. Every time she said she wouldn't go in depth about how the interest rates work nor would not fill the book with spread sheets about this and that I was a little bit saddened...Overall the book did give a few tips here and there, and discovered that I really am not that deep in debt, just need to work on my budget and free flow spending habits.If you want a light but useful book to help you with your overall money issues I would recommend this book."
5,GREAT PURCHASE,MY FRIEND PURCHASED SEVERAL BOOKS AT TOP PRICE-I RESEARCHED AND SAVED QUITE A BIT BY BUYING ONLINE. NO DELIVERY PROBLEMS AND GREAT PURCHASE.
2,"Too broad, not enough specific methods",This book has a great title but it failed to live up to its perception. I thought the book was too elementary and not provide enough of a plan to become financially successful.
5,A Must read for EVERYONE!,"I'm just about to get my undergraduate degree in business administration - and after four years of accounting and financial management classes, this book showed me just how little I've learned about personal finance and making decisions that are right for me. It is invaluable, one of the few books I see myself hanging onto and relying on for years and years to come. It is presented so clearly and is actually very interesting - that's coming from someone with too short an attention span to finish a lot of books. BUY IT!"
5,"A MUST read for high schoolers, 20 somethings and beyond!","I watched a good portion of Suze's seminar on PBS over the weekend and was made aware of this book, which I immediately purchased. This book has excellent, well written advice for all things relating to money and smart decisions to create a happy and fulfilling financial life.Any financial advice is very simply stated and explained and all financial terms or jargon can be looked up via her handy glossary near the end of the book.What impressed me the most was that this book becomes interactive via her website. By answering simple questions, you can develop a customized action plan tailored to your specific needs (debt consolidation, home purchases, car financing, etc.).You owe it to yourself to get this book!"
4,All-Around Good Money Book,"I'm a college junior and only on the second chapter and am already impressed with this book. My mom's a Suze fan and I needed to learn more about my finances, so this book was a perfect fit. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because it seems to be geared perhaps a little more towards people who have already graduated and already having to deal with mortgages and debt etc instead of people like me who are simply trying to get a head start. However, that being said, this book really is amazing. It's a step-by-step financial process with an online supplement to boot. It also has a glossary with a lot of financial terms, just to make sure the lingo isn't over your head.It's really a great investment, I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about money who's looking to safeguard their finances...oh, and who's young, fabulous, and broke."
5,Yes you CAN be broke AND fabulous.,"I live in Manhattan where it's hard to think of those two words in the same sentence. My parents have given me financial guidance books before but there is something about this that validates who you are and who you want to be- just in the title, that made me respond to it. I am clueless about money and I hate thinking about it. But you have to. This book, along with the online component, was kind of like a financial Mary Poppins. She tells you what to do and how to do it- in a non-condescending way. I wish I had had it 10 years ago. If you are a young woman with money problems like I am, don't question- just buy it and do what she says."
4,Answers to all your questions,Excellent book answers a lot of common questions and fills you with great ways to boost your credit.
5,Must Read,"I read this book, then bought my mom and I a copy of Women and Money. I loved them both so much that I am thinking of starting up a Suze Orman book club on the campus where I work so that a group of us could get together and see how we're keeping up with everything and moving forward."
4,Great book,"This book provides a great basic understanding of personal finance. It also gives real tips on how to take action to get started. Suze also includes lots of websites to get additional information. I plan to share this book with my family and friends.Thanks, Suze!"
5,Love this book!,"This book has loads of information offering great financial advice! I loved it and the plus side is that it was easy to read, no big fancy words that were hard to understand."
4,Great book.,"besides the fact that book is a little outdated, the information was still very useful for a young, broke newly graduated student."
5,Really great book.,This book has single handily changed my life for the better and would recommend it to anyone who needs better understanding of the financial world.
5,"You may read in short spurts, but worth reading all","This book IS fabulous. You may not be young or broke to read this and get a lot out of it. She explains basics in a fact-filled, breezy, informative style that gets to the heart of every topic. Some topics are student loans, why you shouldn't cancel all your credit cards, and others that will surprise and enlighten you.This book will not overwhelm anyone as it is interesting, topical, full of more easily grasped practical advice than other books, and fun to read. This is a MAGNIFICENT starter book, or even the only book on this topic you absolutely need."
5,"Orman: The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous & Broke","This is a great book, clearly written and easy to find what you are looking for. I give it as wedding and graduation presents."
5,A must read for anyone and everyone,"I thought I was good with money. Even my parents thought i was good with money. But thanks to Suze Orman, I am even better. She taught me soooo much. The best part is that the book is easily digestible. She has it set up so you dont need to read the book cover to cover but only what is relevant to you. I read the book cover to cover anyways. It has tons of great information that never occurred to me. Plus, it has helped me fix my husband's credit. Awesome book with lots of information that is relevant to all ages."
5,Don't have to be broke to use this book!,"I bought this book because I wanted something that would help me demystify the financial world (stocks/bonds/401Ks/etc.) This book did just that! Great advice in a well packaged, attractive reading book."
4,I'm not an idiot...,"As far as informational content, this book is great. I really think it contains everything a 20-something needs to get onto the right track financially. I also like that it integrates with the website to give you more personalized advice.However, the jaunty, somewhat condescending tone throughout the book REALLY irks me. I can't help but feel talked down to when she's constantly saying things like ""I know you've been too uninspired to figure out how a Roth IRA works."" Stop telling me why I'm financially ignorant. Just give me the information.Also, the book and website sometimes contradict one another. The book tells me that with my age and health status, I don't really need life insurance... while the website keeps exhorting me to Protect My Family."
4,Everyone Should Read This,This book covers a lot of great information that everyone should read. Even though it is targeted to the YFB crowd the tips are applicable to everyone. Very energetic tone and will keep you reading.
2,Suze Orman,"Bought it for my daughter; didn't cover how to find a good job and how to interview for one,and too much about ordinary financial info she's rehashed on her TV show and other books."
5,Fast Service,I got the book very quickly and it was in great condition as promised . Thank you for a great sale!
1,Rehash with a different cover,"I think one KEY point that Suze's readers should stick to if they want to save SOME money... don't buy another book with regurgitated stuff from earlier books, thrown together with a new and catchy title, designed primarily to make the author even richer! This is more of the same old, same old, and she should be a bit ashamed because of it."
2,"Good advice, I guess....","Suze Ormon's advice is important to pay attention to,but in my opinion it's possible to get elswhere in abetter package. If you like Suze's presentation, fine,but she just seems overly chirpy to me. She's FAR betterIMHO than Mr. Kiyosaki of the two Dads, or real estatepromoter Robert Allen, for instance, butmy taste runs more to the Dolans, Jane Bryant Quinn, orAndrew Tobias....or Benjamin Graham, though he's far lessentertaining.Don't spend all you make!Pay yourself first!Hey, maybe I should write a book. LoL..."
1,SAME INFORMATION DIFFERENT COVER,I found the information in this book is just a compiled list of information that is on the internet.
4,Great introduction to money management.,I was looking for an introductory book to money management and investment for the early 20s. This is a great book for any young professionals looking for a little guidance from how to secure high credit score to investing in you 401K.
5,Easy to read and knowledge that makes sense,"Suze Orman has written a book that is great for those of us that are broke and under 35. She gives great financial advice in terms that make sense to those that don't have a degree in finance. The book should be kept as it can be used a reference for future problems, such as buying a home and retirement."
4,love suze,so i bought her book.. i havent become the next bill gates.. but im only 24.. i have used some of her ideas and they work.. its simple to read and no big overly complicated words
3,Good read,"Suze's book is a good read for those who are looking for a common-sense personal finance advice, but it isn't anything earth-shattering. Truth be told, you could watch her TV program to get a great deal of the info provided in this book. I didn't think it got ""good"" until she began discussing student loans, wills & trusts, retirement, etc."
5,LOVE IT,"This is the 2nd book by Suze I've owned. I love her. This book is such an excellent tool for my ""generation."" Out of college, saving for a house, paying off debt, etc. It comes with personalized access to her website where after answering a few questions about your financial situation, it gives you a personalized plan of action to meet your financial goals. I highly recommend this book."
5,Helps in a huge way,"I didn't know how much I didn't know about my money before I graduated from college and landed in debt moving to a new city for my job. My sister bought this book for me when she helped me move I am now in much better shape than I was just 10 months ago. This books helps me keep what is already mine, definitely my favorite read in the past year!"
3,Read this before you hit college,"I think Suze shares some really good insights in this book, and it can work as a guide to stop yourself from getting into financial messes (or help 20-somethings get out of it). However, if you've already purchased a home and a car then the goal-setting really won't mean much to you. I was really excited when this book came out--I was 29 at the time, but I'd already bought a house, a car, had two kids, and had a 401k. I was hoping for more info on how to do more with the little bit of money I had. Probably just bought the wrong book."
5,Wish I'd read it sooner!,"This is an incredible book! Finally, a money guide for us regular joes out here struggling with college debt, first houses, cars, etc. The information is really sound and will help you out immensely. Definitely recommended for anyone who is trying to get their finances in order."
5,A must have,"this book has almost everything you need to know, especially for those like me who don't know where to begin. As good as or better than Dave Ramsey."
4,Great book for beginner,"Easy read. If you know nothing about finances, then this is definetely a great place to start. The book touches on alot of topics and she explains thing thoroughly. It however fails to go very in depth on these topics. When finished with the book, I knew way much more than when I started it."
3,"Helpful if you're new at this, null if you're not","This is an excellent book if you're starting from point 0. If you have no experience with handling paychecks, bills and budgets - and knowing why you really should have a retirement plan when you're young - this is a great book. It wasn't useful for me in the slightest however. I'm an underling in an investment firm; I hear conversations about these things all the time. I was expecting new insights and ideas, but this is really the basics laid out in basic terms.Gave it to a friend."
5,Suze Rocks!,"I bought this book on the advice of a friend. I let it sit around for about 6 months before I actually picked it up and read it.I had no clue what I was missing. Since reading this...I've been addicted to Suze. Her advice is easy to understand, she has a great deal of knowledge and the perfect amount of humor.This book talks about everything us Young, Fabulous and Broke folks need to know! I'm already on the road to recovery.THANK YOU SUZE! Keep writing books, I'll buy them."
4,Easy to read and Good Information,"Initially I watched her show: YFB on public television. It had great information for the young adult: students, recent grads, couples, first time homeowners. I like her style of teaching, she is interesting and brings a good perspective to her clients. I borrowed this book from the library and decided to buy it for my own collection. This book could be more in depth, but it is a great overview. If you want to know more about a particular subject you can check out her other books or videos. Suze has a way of making you feel okay about your particular money situation, and offers reasonable advice. I think to myself, ""yeah, I can save money. Yeah...I can own a home."" I definitely recommend this book as well as the video."
4,Young adults have fun,"This book was made fun the young. When I say you, I mean 35 and below. It was a great read and problem solver. Many of the common qurdtions were answered here."
3,Money,"This book would have been great for me if i was actually at a complete lost with my finances, but I was already on track doing everything that Suze Orman recommends for YBF'ers. I guess reiteration and assurance will help me stay on track."
3,Twists and turns galore.,"Jeff Fahey plays a magazine owner, who sends his photographer fiance to Africa to shoot photos of some rare birds for the next issue. In the small resort, she discovers Eric Roberts, a mysterious adventure junkie, and becomes instantly fascinated. The beginning of the movie has some beautiful scenery and it sucessfully combines romance and intrigue. There is a steamy love scene with Roberts and the unknown lead actress (which Eric Roberts fans will love), mixed with some intense action sequences, making this movie enjoyable to men and women alike."
1,Not the original artists!,"The track listing fails to mention that these are not the original recordings of the 17 songs on the CD. ""All newly recorded music by The Hit Crew."" What a waste of money!"
1,Familiar Songs,"If you think these songs are familiar, with a familiar arrangement, you are right. This CD is IDENTICAL to ""Bluegrass From Heaven: The Essential Gospel Collection, Various Artists"". If you already own the latter, don't bother purchasing ""The Absolute Best of Bluegrass Gospel"". Actually, the music is 5-stars *****, I just considered it deceitful marketing to re-release a CD under a different name."
5,A fabulous product!!!!,"@ 2.00+ per bandage compared to 10.00+ locally.Works great. Several serious skin cancers on my husband's head. So neat, hardly noticeable, and so much better than bandaids, etc. Even though more expensive than bandaids, they are so much easier to use and stay on for two days. No medicines to apply."
1,it sucked,I could not believe how tarnished and scratched this was when it came in. And there was no paperwork included to return this trash. I just ordered from a different company that also personalized it for free. I made sure to write down the name of this company so I will not make the mistake of ordering from here again.Rose C.
4,lovely,"Pendant is very large and shiny, quite nice. Chain is wrong, much too delicate for item, but nice."
2,Think twice,"I found the pendant to be too large the for delicate chain it hangs from, and the pendant is flat and thin. I will be returning it."
3,GSI Outdoors Red Graniteware Salt Shaker,This is a beautiful salt shaker. The color is true red. I loved it until I had to remove the cover to refill the shaker. I had too much trouble removing the cover so I no longer use it. The reason it gets 3 stars is because of my inability to remove the cover.
4,Great Value,"Lifetime warranty, which I have used a couple of times. Watch is very thin. You do have to be careful of the crystal which is also very thin. Overall, very happy and would definitely repurchase. A real bargain and I get a lot of compliments on the watch."
4,Nice watch--just what I wanted,"I wasn't looking for a fancy watch, just a thin, stylish-looking one.The Skagen watch fit the bill--the titanium gives the watch a little class--light weight, a little dressy--I can wear it with suits and with more formal attire, yet functional for everyday use. Thin is the key, as most watches are so bulky (especially the expensive ones), and this watch is very thin.I had a little trouble adjusting the mesh band, but so far, it's holding up nicely. It actually looks more expensive than it is."
4,Premium watch at a modest price.,"If you think thin is in and are susceptible to brand-name fashion statements, this one is priced well below the same model at my local jeweler's (the steep discounting tells me that maybe the Skagen trend is coming to an end). I simply found the watch less than practical. The darn clasp kept popping loose, causing the watch to fall off my wrist and occasioning several trips to the jeweler for readjustments. Still, if you like the idea of a smart and trendy Scandinavian ""dress watch"" that's apt to attract a comment or two, you can hardly go wrong at this price. (Forget about the pricier Skagen's with the date window, which is so tiny I found it illegible.) On the other hand, for fifty bucks you could purchase a couple of Timexes with leather bands, big read-outs and Indiglo lighting."
2,Watch with no second hand,"This time piece does not have a second hand and I would have liked one, also you have a difficult time to return and item I would have liked to have a return option included with the purchase. I would have upgraded to a better watch/ one with a second hand and a date also the web page didn't address these issues that I could see."
4,Great watch,"This is an excellent watch. Slim design, great wrist strap, etc. Very high quality and attractive, simple design. It's one drawback is there isn't a second hand. I didn't realize this when I purchased it for use in a hospital where you frequently need to time heart rates, breathing rates, etc. I use it for more formal occasions where a second hand isn't required."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap... but very expensive.",I bought this model because it looks great. I paid $100 for it from one of the department stores. From the day I bought it the watch has lost about 10 to 15 minutes a day. I thought it was the battery so I replaced it for $10 but that didn't help. In order to get it repaired I had to send it to them via special delivery which cost me $12 more. I checked my mail today and they sent me a letter asking for $8.95 for the cost of repairs or else I won't get the watch back. I'm trying to figure out why I'm being asked to pay for repairs for a watch that is clearly under warranty. I'll be calling them tomorow to find out. In the meantime.. don't buy a Skagen watch unless you like cheap junk and lousy service.
3,It's OK. . .,with some nice arrangements. Skerik opts for accoustic in this band (no FX). Good 5-piece horn line.
5,MADE IN USA!,"Love the size of this small platter. It is a very nice weight and color. The best part about it is it is stamped (not painted) USA.While I planned to just use as a small platter for small dinners or small loaf of homemade bread...I am debating buying a full 8 of these to use a ""mexican food"" dinner plates that I can bake each person's selection on. They are perfect size for 2 enchiladas, beans and rice to finish up in oven, unlike the huge platters/plates restaurants use. Buy one...you will love it!"
2,I wish I had gotten something else,"Bought this for my youngest daughter--she has brothers just one and two years older, and they didn't like it, either. They mostly wanted to stand on it. It's now in the attic...I'll probably donate it to a local day care center..."
2,"Useless, getting rid of it!","My daughter received this toy last Christmas when she was 13 mo. old. I thought it was a great toy. She loved it for about a month, then it became a chair. She loves sitting on it to play her toy piano. It's loud and obnoxous, plus the toys are impossible for a young child to actually pop on. My daughter is now 2 and still has no interest. The batteries died about 8 months ago and we still have not replaced them. So you can see it hasn't been used if the batteries haven't been replaced for that long. I have decided to give this toy to charity instead of having it clutter my childs room for another year."
1,My son loves to sit in it,"My son got this toy last Christams from a relative. Right off, i thought, oh good, a stacking toy. hei s about ready for that. So we get it home and open it up. like the one gentleman said before, one of the legs didnt fit just right. not even a hour later.. you guessed it. My smart kid figured out how to get that lame leg off. and i havent been able to keep it on since. He doesnt use the pop on toys that came with it. keeps trying to match them with legos.. even after showing him. He just thinks that he is suppose to sit in the green mesh basket part. I think that this is one of the lamest toys i have ever had for him.On the other hand, if you dont have the extra money to get your kid his or her own chair then there you go."
5,Perfect pick for me.,I used standard Tortex picks for years but these are less cumbersome for me. I recommend them if you find standard picks get in the way.
2,sweet little princess but hat needs work,The elastic on the hat was too loose to keep it on my pomeranian and she was almost too large for the outfit so it was not the sizing. The dress material is very thin and transparent so it doesn't make the great impression you are looking for.
4,Cute but didn't like the hat,"This is such a cute costume but the hat was uncomfortable for my dog. She would take two steps and pull it off. Regardless, it was a crowd pleaser."
5,Top Reviews from A Pearl Dealer,"As a Pearl Dealer who works for American Pearl & Diamond, (1-800-84-PEARL) I can say that this book is an excellent compilation of pearl varieties and clear explanations of how to identify quality within each variety. This is essential to purchasing pearls. Pearls are a blind item. They are an item you must purchase by comparison. If you are interested in learning about the universe of pearls, this is a source of solid knowledge where not much is available."
1,Nothing New Here,"The book has some nice stories of how Dona B..got her life together through meeting Don Miguel..Other than that there is not much to the book.. It is nothing like the 4 agreements, except that she makes a few more which are basically spin offs of the Ruiz books..not actually any new information."
4,FREEDOM,"In the tradition of her benefactor don Miguel Ruiz, doña Bernadette guides us to take steps to reclaim our personal freedom in this book. She reveals practices and techniques to aide the serious reader in his/her own spiritual journey. Although this is an excellent book I did not find it as profound and powerful and don Miguel's."
3,go to the source...,"Go and buy ""tales from the time loop"" by David Icke. All this and more! It will uncover the mysteries!"
5,Nice,"I bought these earrings on sale and am very pleased with them. They're pretty and do not look cheap. Please note that Amazon has posted a poor photo on their product information page. In real life, the inner and outer circles are perfectly round. The angle of the photo makes the outer circles look like skewed ovals. The finish is polished (shiny), not matte."
4,Racing To The Finish,"I always have to admit that I simply adore the thrill of the race. That has been so true with the Maro Kart franchise for the Nintendo 64. Mario Kart 64 guide for the Nintendo 64 system is a very well put detailed guide that shoecases where you can find all the different courses from the Wario Stadium to the twists and turns from the Rainbow Road, and the multiple paths of the Yoshi Island. The maps here are very helpful, and detail each of the characters and how you can unlock the extras that are highlighted such as the mirror mode, and the other title screen display. It also tells you the best and worst attributes from Mario, Yoshi, Bowser and Toad. The guide is a great buy for anybody who has the need for Kart Speed.Price: A-Maps: A-Help: B+Overall: B+"
5,"Clear, theoretical yet practical, and thematic in nature","This is a modern interpretation of Linear Algebra that effectively uses Mathematica to illustrate concepts and bring them to life. At the same time, rigor and theory are not sacrificed in any way. In fact, detailed yet easy-to-read proofs are ubiquitous, and are almost always accompanied by examples using the software.The book comes full circle in the finale with an exposition of the SVD. In the process, it brings together concepts described throughout the book.In summary: As a working professional in computer imaging, I enjoy this book as my standard linear algebra text. It is a thematic book that really drives the point home, truly giving worth to the suggestion that the SVD should be called the fundamental theorem of linear algebra."
2,Reprint of 1999/2000 Edition,"The edition dated 2009 is not a second edition. It is a reprint of the hardcover 1999 or 2000 editions targeting Mathematica 3. While the text contains helpful applications of linear algebra to chemistry and electronics, references to deprecated features of Mathematica make the learning experience expensive in time and one resorts to the bundled or online documentation of Mathematica anyway. Images of the user interface are a little grainy and dark, while pictures of gui elements such as palettes are plain awful.I understand one can still use the book to augur some sense out of Mathematica 7+in regards to Linear Algebra but I would of hoped that the books ""currentness"" was a little more advertised and a little less expensive."
3,"A good deal, but sometimes harder to digest","When it comes to vitamins and suppliments, I generally only try a new brand without changing anything else in my routine so that I can see how something agrees with me. This suppliment was less expensive than the powder in caps formula I'd been using, and had a higher mg count, but on some mornings I had some stomach discomfort over my previous brand. However, this didn't have any negative health impact."
3,My daughter likes it,I bought this for my son who had not been able to memorize his math facts and am at my wits end to make it as easy as possible. He thinks it is OK but my daughter cannot get enough of it. I do not know if it is because she is learning something that her older brother is too or beacause she likes the music... It is in not as bad as some of the other say but it in not inspiring either unless there is some sibling rivalry to go along with it.
2,"Tuneless, painful and irritating....","I had high hopes for some catchy tunes to help my 3rd grader learn her times tables...what I purdhased was a man with a squealing,high-pitched, annoying voice that neither of us could toerate for more that 5 minutes.Wish that we had tried Multiplication RAP instead of ROCK, it may have been more catchy...who knew?"
2,Uninspiring and Rather Tiring,"I was looking for a karate chop to help break the boredom cycle that my children endure learning their math facts. This certainly wasn't it. After awakening (and scraping the cheerios off our faces,) we all decided that once was certainly enough.On a positive note, it puts the children right to sleep and makes for a fine bedtime audio program (despite the shallow, classical rock-n-roll roots.)(NOTE: Since I can't believe the other review at all, I can only assume it came from the Mr. Caudle or the publisher, Rock-N-Learn. I feel it's unethical to write rosy reviews in order to boost sales. You should instead provide publisher's information.)"
1,multiplication rock,My daughter is not too excited about it. When she first opened it she couldn't wait to get started. After a few minutes she was done with it and has not wanted to listen to it again.
1,Awful--buy the spiral bound green one,"This diet diary was just awful. It is large and awkward, and omits important information. The smaller green one is cheaper and much more thorough--easier to use and doesnt look like a child's elementary school workbook. I did not like this item at all, and ended up only using it one day before tossing it in the trash. Definately not worth $25."
2,it was good,I was part of a mothers support group at church and we based our structure on the contents of this book - it would have worked well but our leader was overwhelmed with life and family and the group dispersed
3,Eh.,"I wasn't a huge fan of this book. Like some people said, it was an easy read, partly because it was 1.5 spaced, almost making it seem like a junior level book. Simple, maybe too simple. I read it in a couple days. It has good info, but nothing new. Also, it is written primarily for moms. Being a single 20-something it was sometimes hard to relate."
3,"Lives up to it's title, but still fun!","The book comes with a floppy disk containing the 18 programs presented in the text. The author explains what each program does, how it works, and suggestions for using, exiting and erasing it. Most of the programs serve no practical use, hence the title STUPID TRICKS, but the games and tricks provide a few moments of diversion for the user. The programs are shareware or freeware by various programmers."
5,Great Levels,"Very nice levels, great warranty but could have been protected better in shipping (nothing to do with the levels)."
3,"Some good, some really, really bad","This collection has good and bad. If you enjoyed the serial style there are two old serials included, but most of the movies are really, really bad. But if you are a fan of the really, really bad, so bad it's good old Sci Fi's this just might be for you!"
4,SCI-FI COLLECTION V.1,Sci-Fi Collection V.1 Brought back memories and added some new ones.It was fun to see some of the really old attempts at sci-fi and compare to what you see now.
3,space,They were ok. I enjoyed them. The value was good. I reccomend them. Sci fi buffs will appreciate them. I give them a C+ as they were low budget films.
3,Received on time but dvd case was damaged,Received on time no problems there and none of the dvds were damaged but the outer case holding the dvds was damaged and one of the holders in the case that holds dvd was broken.Every thing else was as listed so I give it 3 stars and it wood have been 5 if not for the damage to case and holder in side.
1,expensive shipping poorly executed,"American Caviar Sampler Gift SetDo not order as a gift, you have no control when set is delivered. Also you have no control if recepient signature is required, e.g. they will leave it at the door despite charging you $25 for shipping"
3,HUGE,"Okay, I understand that this is supposed to be a restaurant-style pasta plate or serving plate, but it's freakin' ENORMOUS.I got one of these secondhand with a lot of mismatched Fiesta plates. I love the 9"" rimmed bowls but this is just too big and too heavy. They're difficult to manage and a pain to wash (don't fit nicely in my dishwasher and take up all the space in the sink and drying rack). The serving plates are actually easier to handle than this is."
2,No Fiesta logo on the Cobalt bowl,"you claimed it was Fiesta ware,but there is no Fiesta logo on the cobalt bowls ;The scarlet bowls I ordered have the logo on them.The cobalt bowl also has scatches on it."
5,Awesome!,"This is awesome! I bought this for my husband 5 years ago. Still works and he uses it all the time. I originally bought it for him because he is a Marine and was deploying. I thought it would be great so that he could charge his razor, psp and whatever else he needed to out in the desert. It worked great. He still uses it all the time. It does take a bit to charge but charge it on the wall at home and you have a ready to go energy source. Then when you're out and you use that up, use the sun'd power and you're ready to go again. AWESOME!"
4,Awesome Gadget,"If you're looking to be a little more green, this is a great option. Not to mention the if you're in a bind and need some power. I travel for work and sometimes I'm out in the middle of nothing and this has saved me a few times. Granted I could have plugged into the cigarette lighter but it's cool to know that you're getting some of the energy you use directly from the sun. I wish it had a way to keep the solar panels from getting dinged up when you throw it in a computer bag but I just use an extra sunglasses bag."
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought this to charge my phone when I'm out camping, on vacation, etc. It'll charge up just fine from a USB connection but I get almost nothing from solar charging. I live in S. Florida and have left it outdoors on a cloudless day and I can't get more than a tiny trickle. I've even had it propped up to face directly into the sun (periodically adjusting it to stay that way) and still no improvement.If you charge it via USB it'll work as a last-ditch backup battery. I had it fully charged and used it to recharge my Samsung Infuse. The result - less than a 20% charge on my phone before the Solio was drained. My AAA battery backup charger works way better and I really wanted the Solio to work....I was rooting for it but ended up being tremendously disappointed."
1,Solar Charging? Fail. :(,"This didn't charge up. Directions are great; product failed. Do you own a Droid? Don't get this because the adapters don't match up with the tips. Thanks for making a Droid tip. Next time, make an adapter so it will plug into the solar charger! Oy vey! Epic fail. :( Still heavily anticipating solar technology though. Still rooting for it."
2,Just not practical,"I really wanted to love this product, it seemed like the perfect solution for extending battery life of my favorite electronics. Here is what I don't like:-This IS NOT the unit that uses iGo adapters, if you must get a solio, get that one, not this one. The adapters that come with this are very custom.-It takes forever to charge. I know solar power isn't super speedy/efficient, but days to a full charge seems excessive.-It feels like junk. It is plastic, with a cheap feel to it.-It isn't small.-No wall charger (USB only)What I like:-It's a solar charger.-It has a batteryAll in all, I just can't recommend it. I won't return it, but I'm going to keep the box and mine might make it onto ebay."
1,Sounds cool but a big waste of time,"Here's the thing: it's not like you magically hook up your device to this and it charges from the sun. You use the solar panels to charge a battery which then charges your device. So you need to have this thing in the sun all the time to keep the battery charged - and then it will take forever to charge whatever device you have. As if that's not bad enough, it comes with 1.5 million pieces - so it's not exactly as portable as you'd hope.If you read the instructions, the manufacturer is clearly trying to sell this based on some environmental claims - you won't be using electricity to charge your iPod. But your iPod will take forever to charge, you have to carry around the little array, the battery, and whatever adapters you might need. Clearly, there's a better way to save energy. Keep your fridge slightly warmer, or adjust your thermostat. This is a waste of time."
1,Not easy to use,"Couldn't get it to work, not user friendly. Wish I didn't throw out the box, so I could return it. Waste of money."
2,look at the details,"the product seems like a great idea, however, it did not come with attatchments for an i-pod, which is the reason we bought it. Called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number. it has just been a hassle"
1,Love the idea,"I love the idea, but plan to wait until the gadget is perfected. This could be a wonderful thing to own someday."
1,Horrible!,"I bought this for a soldier who is training to go to Iraq, and it does not work. I would never recommend this product. It is horrible that a company would market a product that simply does not do what it says it does. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!"
3,Its Green but its sooo slow...,The Solio works great as an extra battery while traveling with the wall charger. But it takes forever to charge from the sun. If you leave it in the window for about a week you might get half a charge. This will charge your phone at least once. Which was the reason i got it. Im sure it will be better in the summer when I bring it to the park or the beach and use it at the same time as im using my Ipod.The connectors that it comes with are great! and the design is really nice.p.s after impulse buying this I researched and found possibly better alternatives like solar rolls from brunton. Looks like you can get more for your buck.
2,I Wanted To Love It,"I wanted to love this. It's solar, it's pink, it's whimsical.It could have been an integral part of my earthquake kit (we do live in Los Angeles).But it didn't really work for me. First off, charging it in the car is pointless and slow. It requires direct sunlight so even a tree giving some shade makes it not charge. Secondly, it takes about eight hours to charge fully, that means you have to follow the sun for eight hours.Unless you live in a yurt, you probably only get a few hours of sunlight from each window. Which brings me to my third point.It charges best when left outside.Nope, it's a $90 item and I don't want to leave it lying around outside.I get that it's hip to be green and pink is fun and playful, the design it beautiful and the freebies are flowing with these (everyone at fashion week LA got one) but it just doesn't do what it's supposed to do.I'll wait for the second generation, hopefully it will work better."
4,Thriving from vague objectives,His 26th book in the series is the usual 40 weeks of the daily and Sunday comic strips; nice way to save all of his comics in a bound book.
5,Another great Dilbert collection,"Another Dilbert collection, another great Dilbert collection. Highly recommended, of course, if you work in an IT/IS/MIS department, or just in an office. They never get old, or out-of-date. Mr. Adams hasn't slowed down or backed off one bit - Ratbert the $100 million CEO-reject, multiple Wally updates, Dilbert and dating....Another worthy addition to your Dilbert collection."
4,Quality,"Not as good as Dilbert shows you the business but still a fun read, the dilbert comics are great."
1,Effective As Water,Save your money. This stuff smells like urine. I spray it on his toys & my cat looks at them & walks away. Xtreme is about as effective as water but smells worse.
2,Is this really catnip??,"My cats are not at all interested in items sprayed with this stuff. On the other hand, anything I put dried catnip on, they love, so I know they're fans of catnip. I would not recommend this spray."
2,Doesn't Work,"I don't get any kind of smell that other people have reviewed and said. When I spray something with it, my cat will come rub against it for a little while (2 minutes at best) and then he is totally uninterested. I think that's because it doesn't smell anymore. I can't use it to spray toys or anything else because he's just not interested. I feel like I wasted my money."
1,Smells digusting,This product smells nothing like catnip. It's quite an offsetting sent for me as well as my cat. My cat lovessss the smell of catnip but when i spray this product he just walks away. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody.
3,it's okay,"Not exactly a good sized towel if you have hair past your shoulders. It is hard to wrap longer hair. Altho, it does seem to draw out more water than a regular towel."
4,Looking forward to his next book,"When I began this book I wasn't sure I would finish it, thinking that it would be too implausible. Instead, I found that I couldn't put it down. It was very well researched and developed, and it was so realistic that it left me with a very uncomfortable perception of the future of organ transplantation and governmental control of the same. I have recommended the book to several of my friends, two of which have already read it and plan to write their own Amazon.com review. I truly do look forward to Steve's next book, and I think it would make a great movie!"
4,Innovative subject matter,Thoroughly enjoyed the interlacing of the medical and law fields. Creative writing about our futures. Felt shortchanged by the ending though - too abrupt - needed to finish the story.

2,Terrible spray handle,"If you threw away the spray handle and replaced it with a different one this would be a great product. The trigger mechanism will pinch your skin, glove every time you release it. Save yourself the hassle and buy the hudson with a plastic trigger.My dad's (with the plastic handle) is about 8 years onld, and the only time it leaked, he called Hudson and they sent him new parts at no charge."
3,Just and average sprayer.,"I like the design, but there is nothing that stands out with this sprayer, it pretty much does the same thing as a lower cost sprayer. save your money and buy a cheaper one."
3,An intriguing vocal interpretation of Monk,"Soesja Citroen was the first jazz singer to dare an all-Monk album. This Dutch artist wrote the lyrics (in English) for five of the eight tunes on this album. Though I had never heard of her, the album apparently was very popular in Europe. I have to compare Citroen's album with Carmen McRae's interpretation of Monk (see ""Carmen Sings Monk,"" 1988 recording). Citroen's singing and her backup band are good, though I prefer McRae's album because the singing and playing are more Monkish. On Citroen's album, I especially like her interpretations of ""'Round Midnight,"" ""Blue Monk,"" and ""Well You Needn't."" The first two are the only songs on Citroen's album that have the same lyrics as the same tunes on McRae's album. (Some of Monk's song titles have been changed for the vocal versions.) For a good but different vocal interpretation of Monk, avid Monk fans will enjoy this album by Soesja Citroen."
2,Wrong product,"I received the wrong product when I ordered this - I got the Fireman's theme instead. We decided to keep the toy for a gift. It's cheap, and that shows in the construction and detail. Overall, it's a decent cheap toy but definitely not impressive."
1,P-o-S!!!,"This thing is the cheapest, plastic P.O.S.in the world. It feels like a toy.I think if you pulled to hard on the paper towels, it would snap in half. Do yourself a favor and buy something more substantial."
1,"Awful quality, construction, and ugly","I can't believe anyone would offer this for sale at all. It's simply awful. The plastic is cheap and thin with ugly edges. The color is an off-white grayish that doesn't match any normal white kitchen stuff. The doors are equally cheap and flimsy. Mine also arrived with two obvious molding defects and discolorations. Even without those, I'd send this back as it's simply too ugly to put in any kitchen. Worst product I've ever bought on Amazon."
1,Horrible junk,Cheap plastic trash. Wouldn't pay 20 cents for it if I knew about it. Had to return it and get something better. Do yourself a favor and save the hassle to return it. Buy something else
2,Not worth the money!!!!,"I broke mine the 1st day!!! The paper towel holder is supposed to be adjustable, but when I tried to move it it snapped and broke. The plastic doors get stuck. I dislike this ALOT!"
3,3 stars,part of the plastic broke when we tried to first install it. very cheaply made. was originally looking for a wooden 1 which I had years before. it was much nicer quality. too much money for a piece of plastic.
1,Worst piece of garbage ever!,"This is a cheap piece of garbage and it should be avoided at all costs. The paper roll holder is barely functional and the cutting edges for the foil and plastic wrap butcher the wraps rather than cutting them cleanly resulting in foil and plastic wrap that is jagged and often unusable.Amazon should remove this item from the catalog in order to maintain its reputation as a purveyor of good and reliable products.You will get angry and return the item as soon as you see it, and especially if you install it and try to use it. Avoid this thing. You are better doing without a paper towel and foil dispenser than buying this one."
1,POS,"This product is awful, you can't adjust the paper towel holder, it doesn't cut the wax paper or plastic evenly or right at all. I so regret getting this. What a waste of money and time. The added space for condiments and kitchen accessories is useless because nothing fits! Please don't waste your money, this product sucks!"
3,I'm not sure it's worth the aggravation,"I have not yet had the time or patience to finish the first game. I find it annoying that sometimes when you need to redo a part of the game from the last saved spot you have to endure the movie portion that leads up to the task to be completed such as fleeing the troll. Perhaps it's just me, but I find Quidditch very tedious. That said, I do enjoy learning the new spells and collectiing the jellybeans and stars and some of the dialog is quite enjoyable."
3,a frusterating problem,"when i first got this game it worked great and arrived at my house in great time. But wen i was in the middle of the Lumos challenge, i hit a certain gargoyle wit the spell, and then only 2 out of 3 clouds appeared so i cant make it to the opposite ledge, so i cant complete the game. Has this happened to anyone else or is this just an individual problem.thanks"
3,"Overall Good, but Cheesy--Save your Money and buy the book..","I enjoyed this DVD a lot, but the commentary is cheesy (not from Phil).. there should be TWO tournaments within the DVD, not just one. The spotlights roving about DURING the tournament made it hard to view what was going on. The constant FullTilt commercials and plugs are just ridiculous considering we're being CHARGED for this DVD.Compared to the Green Book, which I loved, this DVD sucks. It is too short, too commercialized and gimmicky, and really should have gone into ""What if I had NOT called that bet"" scenarios... or ""what if I had raised here instead of before the flop.."" In other words, this DVD is really only one short tournament with some good commentary.I love Phil Gordon and he's a great player/teacher, but this DVD falls way short of his book's level of teaching."
2,Basic intro with little to offer,"Compared to Harrington's 3 volume opus there is little to learn from Phil Gordon's discussion of final table strategy. The concepts of chip stack size, starting hands in short table play, and heads up play are only given perfunctory analysis.Alan Safani"
1,"It's so bad, I returned this item.","Somebody recorded the songs on this CD with a keyboard in their basement! Don't waste your time buying this, as you will want to return it as I did. I'm surpised Amazon would even sell this, it's so bad."
2,"Helps with the background, but not the music.","What this lecture does well is show the relationship of the story of Tristan and Isolde to the soap opera antics of Wagner (Tristan), his wife Mina (Brangaene?) and their Swiss neighbors, the Wesendoncks (King Marke and Isolde). But I wanted something that would help me get through this four hour opera without falling asleep. The musical examples were not sufficient. There are apparently recurring leitmotifs that correspond to Tristan, Isolde, the love portion and other elements of the story. They were mentioned but not explicitly pointed out. Thus this CD can't be compared to the great job that Deryck Cooke did inAn Introduction to Der Ring des Nibelungen."
2,A strech,"I don't know about some of the conclusions in this documentry. I am no bible thumper, but I think most historians agree ""Jesus"" probably did exist."
3,Ok,"It's an over-the-top AMAZINGNESS with an infomercial aesthetic. The material may be true but the conclusions are probably not entirely. Some interesting facts about the Flavians that I was unfamiliar with. Might be worth a buck and an hour, but it won't change your life."
3,"First Story Great, Other Lack ""Ummph""","This was the first of Ann Rule's true crime books that I found myself skimming many of the pages.Rule begins with the title story, You Belong To Me, about a Florida Highway Patrol officer who kills an innocent woman out of rage because his wife is divorcing him and his mistress is getting smart to his lying, cheating ways. It's really an amazing story and quite humorous, in a twisted way, that this highly commended officer should end up committing a series perverse acts and serious crimes.After reading the good cop turned bad story, however, the others included simply leave a lot to be desired. I was very disappointed that one story was actually about a case that had been investigated as a murder but ended up only being a auto accident. Somewhat interesting....for Reader's Digest, maybe, but not a Ann Rule true cime book though.Still take the time to read it. Just don't expect the same quality as Rule's other works."
5,My Favorite Ann Rule Book....,next to the Stranger Beside Me. A thrilling and bizarre ride through the demise of a truly sick highway patrol officer. The story of Tim Harris is so compelling precisely because he seems to be the last person you would expect to commit this type of crime.My only rant is that there is precious little delving into exactly what caused the man to turn so bad.
5,Riveting!,"As a new resident of Indian River county, I was shocked to learn that this crime occurred in its more recent history. The step-by-step police work saved me from any real trepidation about living in this area now. Only Ann Rule could have fully and truthfully documented the story with all its nuances."
3,A good collectors item to have.,"This isn't exactly the best of Ann Rule, but the story about Tim Harris is interesting. Ther are a few other interesting stories in this book."
2,Don't be fooled,"The album says ""Starsound Orchestra"" but there is nothing orchestra about it. It has a good song selection but it's all electronic keyboard done fairly mechanically. Not a hint of strings. There's not even any credits given to the musicians. Curiously the design of the artwork has credits but this is a manufactured piece from Legacy Entertainment. It's disappointing because it looks so promising."
5,Highly recommend this filter,"I bought this Russell competition fuel filter for my project 1966 GTO. After looking at this filter I realized that it did not say on the box or filter how it is installed (flow direction). I called Edelbrock / Russell and spoke to a rep who was very knowledgeable and told me that it is uni directional, meaning it doesn't matter how I install it. I was impressed with speaking to a rep within only a few minutes and getting an answer in English to my question. I would highly recommend this product and the company."
5,Great for Power Carvers,"It is a well made, highly versatile work center for any hobbyist. The right side of the work surface is a table vise to hold your work piece steady. One top compartment will hold all your rotary tool bits. The Tool holder pole slides between the compartments for storage. Under the left side is a compartment big enough for your rotary tool and flex cable and any other pieces that don't fit in the removable top. Under the vise section is the vacuum area. Stick the vacuum cleaner hose in the back and your sawdust and wood chips quickly disappear.Milescraft 10050003 MobileX1 Compact Portable Hobbiest's Work Center"
1,What a waste!,"These ""pull the tabs"" books are poorly designed. Each page is composed of seven layers--a cardboard sleeve with cutout pictures which holds the cardboard tab which has a piece of acetate folded over each side and is interlaced with another cardboard sleeve. The tabs do pull out easily so you can see the whole picture. They are incredibly difficult to get back into the sleeve since the acetate sheets get caught on the cutout pictures. It is also very easy for a child to pull the entire tab all the way out of the book which exposes the staples used to connect the acetate to the cardboard tab. Feeding the cardboard tab and the acetates back into the inner sleeve is enough to drive anyone crazy. Skip these books!"
2,Prints and Visual Communication,"Book recommended by art instructor. Author is very erudite in words used and concepts presented. Much of what was presented was of little value to me. I did learn that there were different styles of engraving developed in different countries. Author's major concern seemed to be to have a consistently, accurately presentation of an idea or technique, which in his view was performed by photography. In terms of making my own prints, I learned very little."
2,Bosch water pump for BMW,"This water pump has plus and minuses. The plus is price and the propeller is made from brass. The bad is the overall quality of the unit. The brass propeller is pitted in the material, it also has some sharp edges all over it like it was casted by machine but finished by hand. I know that I shouldn't judge the product by its look, but in this case I feel that it tell the story of quality of the product. I ended up return the Bosch and ordered the factory OEM reman unit instead. It was more expensive but the quality was much better."
5,"Not metal, better.","The reviews for this water pump are from people who haven't done their research. Yes, this is not a metal impeller, but the thing is there were problems with the bearings wearing out with the metal impellers, so both BMW and Bosch went to a composite material for their impellers. This is the newest technology for BMW water pumps, and not prone to failure like the original plastic impellers."
2,NOT WHAT WAS pictured,"like the other reviews, is plastic, not a brass metal AS SHOWED! dont know if it fits yet, will know tonight! on the box it says it fits 128i,323i, 323ci, 323ic (3l)(3.2L)(2.8L)(2.5L) L6.... nothing about a 325i.... but mine is a 3L so maybe it will?"
1,Build quality is low,"Same as the previous customer, the pump I received has the plastic impeller (also the impeller is black color, unlike the product photo). The product photo is misleading.Overall build quality is low. There are scratches on the metal body and rough edges on the plastic. If not for these rough edges, I almost feel like it is a second hand unit.The bearing seems to be good, but I have no confidence how long it can last."
2,Not Brass anymore!!,"I bought this water pump based on the pictures of the brass impeller and reviews stating it has a brass impeller. The one I just recieved on 4/16/12 did in fact have a Plastic impeller. Its possible it was composite, but looks like regular ABS plastic with some casting flash to me.Overall high quality casting and overall construction, but did not feel comfortable with the plastic impeller and the amount of drag the bearing made when trying to spin by hand. I sent it back."
1,Problem about opening it,"I tried to put battery into it, but cannot open it. Please help me solve the problem and email me back ASAP! Thanks!"
5,If I could give it 10 stars I would!,"My shelves are full of pastel and other art books but by far, this is the absolute best! Do just as Harley says, and USE it, do not just put it up on your shelf to collect dust. Mine is sitting next to my easel for constant reference. I love this man's work, his writing style is witty and makes it feel like he is talking right to YOU! I have seen a definite improvement in my pastels, just from using this wonderful book!"
5,The greatest change,"In the three months I have had it beside me, this book has made the most dramatic differece in my life as an artist. When you have lost all your enthusiasm and feel you just can't make it, this book is like a therapy session. It all started to come to light and I realized if I could read this book and have it inspire me this much I COULD start again and succeed. Thank you Mr.Brown. I will take all of your advice and I will do it with a new found joy !!!! Judith Jackson"
5,Probably the most helpful art book I've ever read!,"In this book don't expect to be taught every technique for every medium. No, that's not Mr. Brown's goal at all. Instead he's going to share the things that make a painting more interesting, more full of life and quite simply 'work' in a way that draws the viewer into the art. I've been amazed as page after page has been loaded with things that I never knew - that no one ever told me before! - even though I've read dozens of books on technique and have taken classes. These are the eternal truths of composition, dominate tone and color and the list goes on. I can tell that this will be a book I will refer to endlessly throughout my journey as an artist."
3,Perhaps a more accurate title?,"I wish this book had been called, ""Eternal Truths for Every Artist Who Works in Two Dimensions."" It's about flat art. A very few points are relevant to sculpture, but not many. Could easily have saved the money I spent on this and have NOT earned the purchase price back in increased sales yet."
5,Out-of-print art book in excellent condition,"Harley Brown's Eternal Truths for Every Artist is an out-of-print book and, although expensive, Sylvia's Choice was the low price at the time I ordered. I was very pleased with its condition and the speed with which it arrived. The description given at Amazon.com was accurate and completely honest. I would order from this seller again without question. The personal note on the shipping receipt was a nice touch. My wife who received this book as a Christmas gift was thrilled and very appreciative. She had been trying to find a copy of this book for several years."
3,O.K.,"Maybe I was swayed by the poor recording quality, but I just didn't find this album all that special. I know that it remains popular to fans and critics alike, but I thought some of the performances were rote, and other melodies were unrecognizable."
5,"No regrets purchasing this product, does exactcly what its supposed to do.","Perfect for indoor shots whether it be sports or weddings. Only takes a few seconds to snap on, take a snap shot of the light source and Bam! perfect custom white balance. A little on the pricy side but well worth the money."
4,First-time ExpoDisc User,"I used the Expodisc the very night it arrived in the mail at an outdoor, nightime high school football game. I have taken images on this field at night before with acceptable images using my D200 and Sigma 70-200 2.8, but after using the Expodisc, discovered the colors in my images were noticeably cleaner and more accurate. I was very pleased. However, I tried it in a gym, one week later and had poor results. I resorted to my camera's auto WB, instead. I may not have performed the custom calibration correctly, though- I'll keep working with it."
2,It works but it is a pain to use,"Well the product does work as advertised. It gives you very accurate custom white balance readings. The problem is that you have to shoot the sample image back into the light source, which is not always possible to do unless you are in a studio or controlled location shoot. For scenics it is not very practical. I used it a few times but it mostly sits in my bag now. It's too much money for something that you don't use because it is a hassle. I am open to suggestions from other users if I am making it unecessarily complex or am misunderstanding how it is supposed to be used."
2,true blue,after testing my disc it seems to make my pics over saturated with a bit of blue while using the grey card my pics seemed truer to correct color maybe I just got A bad copy?
2,ehh,this product was one of those trial and error buys. I wasted money on this item because i heard so many great things about this product in general from a few local photographers. Wow was I let down. It wasn't helpful by any means and is more of a hassle to to work with then just spot metering or using a target which basically is what this thing is. Not a great buy. The company shipped it fast and was in great condition but the product it's self was lame.
4,Love it!,"I just received this item, I already notice a difference in my images. I'm am excited and convinced! The colors didn't spill on to the main subject. I was instantly impressed. My only wish is for the instructions to be made more clear and the include images, however, I watched a few vids on the website, they helped me, but as it seems there is no one set way to do this as two of the photographers said to do something different from one another. One says point toward the light source and the other says something a lot more complicated. The instructions speak from a perspective of someone who is not an absolute beginner."
4,Want Bright Red without Bleaching? Buy this!,"I applied this to my faded permanently colored medium brown hair (ion brilliance permanent creme) and about two inches of dark brown roots. Used 30 volume creme developer (Salon Care brand). Left on for 45 minutes and then rinsed and conditioned. The box says to shampoo, but I didn't. This color is extremely bright, but not magenta - more like a candy apple red. Granted, it is very red and bright and I am extremely happy with it. I am slightly disappointed that it's not darker, but I'm not going to complain since I didn't have to bleach my hair. Color is comparable to Jerome Russell Punky colors Pillarbox Red."
2,cracking crystals,"I have three Skagen watches in my drawer in various slim styles like this one. They all have cracked crystals. I'm not hard on watches, I'm a 58 year old office worker. I certainly didn't manage to smash all three. So, despite the fact that I love the looks, especially of this titanium one, I won't be buying another."
1,"Poor Clasp, fell off and was lost on first day.","This watch has a very poorly designed clasp and the first night I wore it I noticed it had fallen off after about an hour, never to be seen again. I should have returned it as soon as I saw how easy it was for the clasp to come undone."
3,HARD TO READ,"I returned my 342XLTTM because the crystal cracked with no impact (common problem) so I ordered this watch and after two days I am very disappointed as it is very hard to read. There is a lot of glare in any direct light and the hands don't have a lot of contrast with the face. I would not buy this again so I'm looking for another watch to wear every day but am skeptical because the Skagen 380LSXM I bought has the same problem. I like the thin profile of the watch and the clasp works fine but I would like a watch that is easy to read without looking at several angles. So, I'm hesitant to buy another Skagen without seeing it in person."
3,Nice but with Constant Repairs,"I've owned this watch for almost 2 years, while I do like the size, weight, and style of the watch (and most Skagen watches in general), I've had issues with the crystal constantly cracking, falling out, and chipping every few months. Skagen used to allow jewelry stores to repair the crystals & clasps when broken, but now require you to send your watch and payment to a centralized skagen repair location, which is quite inconvenient.Unfortunately, I don't think I'd buy a Skagen watch again."
5,SKAGEN TITANIUM MESH WATCH,"This my second Skagen watch. I have dumped my rolex in favor of the slim, accurate, comfortable Skagen. I had seen reviews that criticized the way the band fit and how well the clasp worked. If there ever were problems they have been corrected. Iam very pleased with my purchase."
2,Skagen is junk,"Looks great, but I'm on my second Skagen. The first was this type - after a while, the band kept undoing itself randomly. Returned it. Now I have one with a leather strap, but the dial keeps popping out (and stopping the watch). And the crystal mysteriously cracked, with no reason. I've searched and some others had the same problem."
3,Poor visibility,"The watch has low visibilty at night, and now im arranging to get a different model that has a light"
4,"This watch is gorgeous, but not perfect for those with very small wrists.","I have absolutely no complaints about the appearance or operation of this watch, it's simply beautiful, and goes with almost anything. My only complaint is specific to me, and those like me. I have the band set to near the smallest setting (2 marks from the last one). The band has a wide radius turn where it connects to the watch case, meaning that despite having a small face (great for people with smaller wrists), it leaves a gap between your wrist and the band on top (not as great)I've still been wearing it every day, and this is my favorite watch to date. At the price ($62), it's an unbelievable deal."
4,Love the look,Ordered this watch for my husband for Christmas. We both love the color and the fact that the band is thin. Only complaint is that the band is hard to clasp. I have helped my husband with it the few times he has worn it over the past week. I think it will take a while for him to be able to get it closed properly on his own. I just hope the clasp holds and it doesn't fall off. I have read on other reviews that this can be an issue. Would hate for him to lose it since he really likes the look of this one.
5,Excellent product,I was very pleased. The product is excellent and authentic. In the original box and well shipped.
3,"Nice watch, hard to read dial","The photo shown looks like a blue dial, when it is actually silver in the specifications. The 233LTTM has a silver-gray dial with silver numbers and silver hands. All this silver makes for difficult reading. The watch is nice and thin, and has a great design."
5,excellent buy,This is a great watch with a wonderful look.I have checked prices for a similar watch and found your prie to be the best
4,nice,"I owned this watch for about 2 years. Last week one of my kids decided to play hide and seek with it, they did a good job. I've been using my ""weekend"" watch around the office, and a Timex just doesn't compare to the comfort and class of this item. I would have given this item 5 stars, but that is reserved for a watch that is just as nice and just as thin as this... but with a light. The chain never kinked, clasp didn't wear out, crystal didn't scratch, no moisture got in. But I never really put it through the ringer, had the timex for yard work and what not."
1,"Stylish watch, cheap construction","While this watch is very slim, low profile, and looks very stylish, the construction of it is extremely cheap and very disappointing. It arrived broken, and looking at why it was broken, I found that it looked like the metal watch band was just glued onto a metal tab that was connected to the watch. Very disappointing to see a corner like that cut, the band could of been much sturdier and better secured than with glue. Clearly Skagen cares more about making a stylish watch than they do about making a good product. I would not suggest anyone buy this watch, and I would be hesitant of any of their other watches."
4,Nice watch but..,The watch looks nice but the it can be hard to read and I am paranoid about the clasp coming loose and the watch falling off
2,Not what I imagined,"I bought this watch as a daily wearer. Thin, and a neutral color. The watch was not what I expected when it was received. The gray mesh band is extremely reflective. It ruins the neutral gray look and turns into a overly shiny metal. I had to return."
5,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!!!","My son (who is 13) has a hard time reading a complete book, due to his short attention span. A friend suggested this series of books to us. I couldn't be happier. This series is so interesting that he read all of the books within two weeks!!!! As a parent, I enjoyed them also! This is the best deal on the web for this set."
4,A superb series,"This is a superb series.I am a secondary English teacher and it IS sometimes difficult to get young adults interested in this series. However, it is worth the effort. This is a book that a lot of adolescents will have an easy time identifying with. One child in the family is an illegal, not allowed in the sunlight. Teenagers identify with the character once they start reading it because they are teenagers.This is an almost teenager who the world really IS against. That proves they were right all along.On top of all that, it is also a well written series."
3,slow at shipping,"The books are fine, they were for my son and he loves them. But it took over a month to receive them. Very slow shipping."
1,AMONG THE HIDDEN,"Among the hidden is a book about a boy named Luke. He is the 3rd child in his family, but their family can only have 2 children in your family. So his whole life he is in his house all alone. Because of this he is called a shadow child. One day he sees a girl in a window and he already knows that 2 kids already live there. One day when he knows that everyone has left their house he goes over to see who is there. This becomes his only friend. She gets thrid children to go to the white house to force the gov. to allow third children to live normal lifes. Will it make a difference? Will Luke go to the thing at the white house.This is a horrible book. It has no detail in the story. The book is boring. The author does not have anything to bring you in to the book at the beginning of it. The last setence is ... Lee Grant turned around to see what lay ahead."
1,Great books - just not for kids,"Great writing - very vivid images - very ingrossing stories. I loved the books. But I am 47 years old. If you wouldn't let your kids watch an R rated movie, think hard before you let them read these books.These books are much more realistic and frightening than would be appropriate for children. And the messages are terrifying. In the first book of the series, the protagonist is 'tested' by 'good adults' with fear and intimidation. 'Bad children' are killed. Errors are punished with death. I figured the sadness would let up as the book series continued, but it doesn't.This is heavy stuff, even for an adult, let alone a child. I think the author is gifted, and the books are well written - but not for kids. Please read these and think about them from a child's perspective before you let your kids read them."
5,Excellent series for all ages!,"I first found this series while looking for books to use in a Junior High lit. class. However, I found them just as gripping as the kids did! Since then, I have also used them at the high school level. They are an easy read, and therefore approachable to most reading levels, and they have great themes for discussion. This is one of those book series that can be read and enjoyed by many ages on different levels. This series is suitable to be read alone, in a group, or with your child. Check it out!"
4,Charming,"This is a delightful read, interspersed with luscious-sounding recipes. Susan Loomis paints interesting word pictures and conjures up a feeling of warmth and harmony that I found very pleasant. I am looking forward to trying the recipe for her grandmother's rolls, with which she won the hearts of the florists across the street. Enchanting story!One small quibble: the book could use additional editing, the lack of which can be distracting. If you long to see more photos, visit Susan's web site--it's great!"
2,"""Hey everone--look at my beautiful life!""","Lommis does a nice job of describing the details of life in Louviers, providing some pleasant ""escapist"" leisure reading for Francophiles like myself. The book has some good French country recipes, but overall is a disappointing Peter Mayle derivative that fails to show us anything new or interesting about France.And when Loomis isn't rehashing the now-trite cliches of adjusting to living in France (driving habits; pharmacists; bureaucracy; difficulties in renovating a house; etc. etc.), she's busy convincing us how happy and successful she is. Her self-congratulatory tone quickly became tiresome after the first few chapters--her perfect/beautiful/wonderful/joyous/lovely friends, family, and house were just a little too ""Martha Stewart"" for me. Yuk!"
2,not about a cooking school,"Very disappointing, the only good thing in it is the food. It's terribly condescending and author's ego is all over the place. But the most annoying part is that while it claims on the back that this is a book about a cooking school and anyone about to open a small business should read it, this is not the case at all. She only talks about the school a bit at the beginning and then we are just left with her life, her view of the French, which is not very exciting, and an awful lot of adjectives."
5,Food & Literature,"The book is an entertaining, quick read, but the real gem in its pages is the recipies. Braised chicken in mustard and white wine sauce, apples stuffed with goat cheese, pear and honey clafoutis...I've made these dishes again and again for family and company, always to rave reviews. Buy the book for the story but keep it for the recipies."
3,Entre Deux Opinions,"This book is sort of twixt and between being a memoir and being a cookbook. As a memoir, it mostly succeeds. Mme. Loomis leads an idealized life (from my perspective looking in, anyway) in a small town in France. As a cookbook, it mostly fails - not enough recipes and very little technique. Ironic, considering that Loomis is Patricia Wells research assistant.(For an example of a cookbook/memoir that succeeds on all levels, you must look at Amanda Hesser's ""The Cook and the Gardener."")I have read through Rue Tatin two times now, and I still find it charming. I have made several of the recipes, and they turned out well; the braised chicken in mustard and white wine has become a staple in my house, however."
2,A book searching for a category,"On a scale of 1 to 10, I give On Rue Tatin a 4. I think my main objection is that I purchased it thinking it was a book about France and food as experienced by the author and her family. Unfortunately, it's much more a book about the author who just happens to be living in France.In the end, I'm not sure if On Rue Tatin should be classified as a travel book or a memoir because it does not shine in either category. It fails as a travel book because the author is too self-absorbed to give you any feel for the region of France she called home, and it fails as a memoir because the author's life, at least as related in the book, is far from interesting."
4,A delicious tale,"This book is delightful glimpse into the life of an American family living in Normandy France. Loomis' tale of her culinary adventures mixed with generous helpings of the French culture, make a recipe for a delicious story. The easy-to-follow recipes are simple to make but have unique twists for such Normandy classics as Clafoutis and Tarte Tatin."
4,Almost as good as being there,"OK, so the literary world is full of the adventures of intrepid souls who live their lives in foreign countries and then write a book about it. And aren't we grateful for it! Susam Loomis does a lovely job of sharing the trials and tribulations of buying and renovating her home in France, and even her occasional cooking mishaps are enjoyable.What I enjoy about this book is that Susan has a young child, and this offers a slightly different perspective to other books in this genre (Peter Mayle's ""A Year in Provence"" being the most memorable). As well we have the usual recipes, all sounding delicious, and the day to day amsements and disasters that beset her, all adding up to an enchanting book."
2,This book may not be what you are expecting...,"A few important words of disclosure about this book: From the title, you might expect that this is the story of someone who worked in a french restaurant. It isn't. The author isn't actually a chef--she is an American housewife who writes cookbooks. Also, the author is (or was) a vegitarian and organic food nut who grows her own lettuce so don't expect many stories about duck confit, truffle studded chicken, etc. in the tradition of Peter Mayle.In fact, this book probably owes its existence to Peter Mayle's success. Unlike Mayle, however, Hermann Loomis seems more interested in writing about herself and her child than France.The book is not particularly well written (or edited) and almost seems like notes for a book. And I was hoping for a French ""Kitchen Confidential"". That said, it is pleasant light reading that offers a few insights into life in France. And I'll probably try to one of the dessert recipies."
4,Easy read for a bit of escapism,"I am glad I was given this book as a gift, I probably wouldn't have picked it up myself. (I have not been a huge fan of the ""woman carving out a niche for herself in a quaint European town"" genre). But I have to say, I really enjoyed On Rue Tatin. It was an easy read- and I love thinking a little bit about ""another world"" before I fall asleep. The author is sharing her adventure, and I liked hearing about her house, cooking, neighbors, friends and family. It was a bit of escapism. I think I will read it again next winter- when it is rainy, dark early, and there is no adventure for me in sight!"
4,A Pleasure - Despite Some Reviews Here (Ignore Them),"Why do we read this type of text except for a vicarious thrill and the gleaning of little details of French life? I can't understand the sometimes negative reviews here. This isn't a work of fiction and these people seem to be reading it in the wrong spirit if they expect it to be. For what it is, a chronicle of one woman/family's life in France, I found it enjoyable and would recommend it. If a few readers are by now jaded thinking it yet ANOTHER Peter Mayle, Ann Barry, et al. tale, well then they need to move on and read something else instead of expecting to find magic over and over in sameness. Enjoyable. And it has some recipes. Buy it."
2,This book could have been so much better; the author is amazingly unaware.,"I was excited to read this book and picked it up at my local bookstore. It started well and then got monotonous. Ms. Loomis does speak of her charmed life time and again without reflection. I can't take a writer seriously if they don't stop and get a clue. Perhaps popping into the nearby church would have helped. Further, the intro to the people of Louviers read like unending introductions at someone else's family reunion. Enough already! We get it. This story looses its way and then never recovers. Ironically, or perhaps coincidentally, Loomis' friend Patricia Wells writes in a similar way. No more for me."
3,A Moving-and-Starting-Over Book,"Another moving-and-starting-over book, this one set in a French town in Normandy. Loomis, her husband, and her young son buy a convent and convert it into a home.French things I learned from this book: One must, at times, be quite stern with the French in order to make a point; amazing recipes; fresh food is everywhere; more French words."
3,"Great collection, nice orchestrations","Great collection of yiddish musical theatre favorites. Unfortunately the singers were told to sing the songs in a supposedly ""authentic"" galician accent which in certain instances is completely incomprehensible to any yiddish speaker.The singers are quite good and the orchestrations are lush and well done."
5,Skull valve caps,There really isn't much to say about valve caps. This product is every thing the description entails. The only thing I can add is they are much larger than shown in the photo.
5,A glimpse at the brilliance that is George A. Romero.,"A group of students from the School of Visual Arts got access to several days on the set of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead and a documentary took shape. Largely intended to be shown to film students as an educational tool in preparing them for the business side of film production, the movie also is a wonderful showcase of writer/director George A. Romero's fierce independent streak and unique handling of the genre. Those just wanting to see Romero showing zombies where to stand or Savini doing his stuff had better stick to the DVD extras on Day of the Dead (or the upcoming multi-disc edition of Dawn that Anchor Bay is putting together), for this documentary is more studious of the man's artistic intent and the nature of independent movie making itself. For serious fans of Romero, however, this is an essential annotation to the Dead trilogy. Highest recommendation."
3,"Behind the scenes of NOTLD, DOTD, Martin, and Two Evil Eyes","This shows how some of the movies George Romero wrote and directed where made. They include interviews with George Romero, The cast of ""Dawn Of The Dead,"" the producers of his films, and special effects artist Tom Savini. It even shows the script to ""Martin"" as well as film clips from it, and interviews with the man that played ""Martin."" It also shows how some of the special effects scenes where done in ""Dawn Of The Dead,"" and ""Two Evil Eyes."""
5,Excellent album,"This is a really great follow-up to Diecast's last album. They are more mature, better polished and sound really good.Two thumbs up from me."
3,"An improvement but, still no orginality","This album is definately better than their last one, but it still isn't that good. I don't know if it's the sappy Meatloaf vocals or the fact that they decided to jump on the bandwagon and use harmony guitars but, overall they still end up sounding rather mediocre in a very stagnent metal scene. To give them some credit it isn't only them but every band decided to let out their own version of ""Alive or just Breathing"" after 2003. If they tried a bit of tact then maybe they could let something out worth buying and listening too. 3 stars."
4,AGGRESSIVE ROCK!!!,"This album is the best! Extremely good! Some songs are sort of hard rock while others sound like metalcore. My favorites are ""Never Forget"", ""S.O.S"", ""Weakness"", and ""Definition Of A Hero"" (which are also the heaviest songs). ""Out Of Reach"" had the great drumming in it! ""Fade Away"" didn't sound that much of metal, sounded more like post-hardcore. ""Hourglass"", ""Nothing I Could Say"", and ""The Coldest Rain"" sounded like hard rock. GET THIS!!!"
4,A good German Vocabulary boost,"This is a valuable little book from the UK, aimed at Advanced German Vocabulary building. It does not seem to be much advertised in the U.S., except through Amazon, but it is well worth the inexpensive price. There is also a French version (Mot a Mot), an Italian , and a Spanish version. This type of manual does not seem to be generallly available in the U.S., as most Vocabulary manuals are really only intermediate level. But this series aims at building a vocabulary for advanced study in the target language for entrance into British Universities. I find it even more useful than the Schaum and Barron's topical vocabularies."
5,Awesome!,"This book is just wonderful!When buying it, I considered improving my German from Upper-Intermediate to Advanced and I got exactly what I needed: practical words and expressions making me sound (more or less) like a native speaker. (Actually, a German whom I met shortly after completing this book said I speak like someone living in Germany for quite a long time, which was very nice to hear.)You may take a look at the pages available from 'look inside' option, they are quite representative of the whole book. If you find the words and expressions too 'smart', then better try something intended for a less advanced level but after you're done with that, get back to this one, chances are high that this time you'll feel you need it."
1,Perry Has Lost iT,"Wow am I glad I got to see Janes back in the day in small venues and of course the first Lalapoloza otherwise if my first encounter of them was this performance I would never had been a fan. There is no passion. I thought cool....the Mountain Song was the second song and that being one of my favorites especially the very first line. It used to come at you like a ton of bricks and at that point you new you were in for a ride. This version seemed like Perry was afraid to put any effort into the lyrics. It just went downhill from there. From Perry gallivanting around the stage like Mick Jagger to pretty boy Navvaro's close ups. I really think it is time to hang it up for good. Leave on a good note. There is just no ""umpph"" to this performance. Sorry Janes Fans...all this really did was keep saying to myself, ""remember when these guys rocked?"""
1,Unwatchable. ZERO stars. Save your money!,"I would have gotten more satisfaction by pulling a $20 out of my wallet and lighting it on fire. I'm a huge Jane's fan and saw them twice way back in 1991. This was so bad, and the crowd was so pathetic I would give it a 1 on the energy scale. I should have listened to the poor reviews. Don't kid yourself, this show was pathetic. Other reviews said ""going through the motions"" and that is right on the money. When I saw them back in the day it was nothing like this. To give you an idea of how bad this was, after about three songs (three too many!) this went into to a box to be shipped to Amazon for a trade in. Amazingly they gave me $5 for it and I feel like I ripped them off. When I watch a live show I want to see energy and crowd participation ala ACDC live at Donington! Save your cash..."
1,Really Sad,Just another sad example of an old band coming out of the wood work for a payday and going through the motions....none of the original emotions of the songs are present...just singing and smiling all the way to the bank. :-(
2,no addiction,"I've always liked Jane's Addiction. They, at one time, had a lead singer who had a distinct voice and a unique ability to deliver irresistibly catchy vocal melodies combined with a very aggressive hard rock/heavy metal style. The way it was done however, was quite original sounding.However, this particular performance leaves me confused and disappointed. It doesn't show any of the bands unique talents, and it actually shows Jane's Addiction as a very mediocre and generic alternative rock band, which they most certainly are not. I can assure you- listen to their early albums, and you'll hear GREAT songwriting.Perhaps Jane's Addiction just aren't a great live band, or maybe they didn't have the energy or dedication to rip out a stellar performance on this particular night, who knows?I'm also not very fond of the way Perry Farrell curses while communicating with the audience. It doesn't offend me, but I'd rather he not do that.Anyway, just pick up one of the bands early studio albums."
3,could been a better way to shipping thier orders,good service but I noticed thier shipping (which may been a fault of the carrier then actually them) but other then that they had good customer service I would have given them 5 stars except that I waited like 3 weeks for my order to come.
2,Average,"Five women, five hard-luck - woe is me stories, five endings that you just knew were coming. There's not much more to this book than that, so don't go into it looking for something other than an easy-to-read story with a fairy-tale ending. I'd recommend this for a day at the beach or for a plane ride - it's written in a very simplistic style. 2.5 stars."
2,2 Predictable for me,"The characters in the story had interesting story lives. However, as some one mentioned ealier the treatment was not only rushed but the event that brought them all together which was the radio contest was not believeable at all. It was simply too good to be true.This book was not a page turner for me. It merely kept my interest until I found interest in another book."
3,A good read!,"The Night Before Thirty is my first read by Ms. Butler. I think it was an overall good concept, but I felt like it left the reader hanging in the end. I wanted to know if the characters would truly carry out their revelations and if, any of the characters would keep in touch as a result of their encounter. Overall, I enjoyed this read and was left wanting more."
3,okay,"This began as a very good book, however it came to an end to fast- and too neat. Overall it is still a nice read and I agree with the other reviewer - don't but this book- check it out from the library."
3,Disappointing,"Since I picked up Sorority Sisters, I realized Tajuana Butler was an author like no other. Hand Me Down Heartache was good, but not quite as good as her debut. However, this novel, though it was enjoyable at times, really lacked depth. The story was over before it began. I love how she develops her characters, but where was the story, and why was it over so quickly? Hopefully a sequel will make up for it's shallow/rushed plot. Don't waste your money, get this from the library if you must."
2,"Eh, it was okay...","I really do believe that many authors should either keep tape recorders on them or eavesdrop on everyday conversation, because Ms. Butler is not the first author I've read who has unrealistic conversation. No one says things like ""...I was thinking that maybe we could grab a bite to eat afterward and continue the engaging conversation we began on the plane."" This was the type of wordplay throughout the whole book and I spent more time rolling my eyes than I did reading. I am usually driven to dialogue first, but in this case, I wish the author would've just told the story in biography format. The back stories of the ""Questions"" were so interesting (minus Lashawnda's Braces Story...that was wack! Her snide comment to her ex-girlfriend was very gross...ugh!), and William's pay-off was ABSOLUTELY UNREALISTIC. I think the author kinda played her readers for suckers because this book ended too happily-ever-after for me."
1,I wouldn't buy one,The first Saeco we bought was dead on arrival. We then got this one and it was okay had some temperamental issues. It doesn't always recognize the tray and you have to play with it until it does. But recently the LCD screen also went dead. Slowly half the letters have come back but the screen is still messed up. We contacted Saeco and they never replied to the email. For an expensive coffee maker this has been a real disappointment.
5,Worth reading!,This was a good book. I have read alot of these and this was one of the better ones. Recommend!
2,Not in English,I laughed when I found that the book was written in Japanese. My son had shown an interest in Japanese weapons--so I guess he's had to settle for looking at pictures.
5,The most excellent movie of all times.,"Robert De Niro and James Woods best performance ever. Nothing after compares to this movie. The music is outstanding. The picking of the characters was most excellent as to where the children looked identical to the adults, and the makeup as when they were older was superb."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"I just finished watching the 229 minute version of Once Upon a Time in America, and I have to say it was a disappointment. It is by no means a terrible movie, and you can see what Leone was trying to do, but he just doesn't pull it off. I can forgive the time shifts and flashbacks; those are easy to follow (if you overlook some glaring anachronisms), but it's the less-than-stellar directing, sometimes wooden acting (especially by the child actors) and the patchy script that I had trouble with. Don't get me wrong, the movie was interesting and I didn't mind watching it for the most part, but to call this one of the greatest films (or even gangster films) of all time, is far too kind. It's a decent movie that is perhaps worth one viewing, with mostly good acting by De Niro and some others, but there are many flaws that keep this off any ""best of"" list I can think of. If you're got three hours to kill and are curious - check it out. If you want a masterpiece, look elsewhere."
5,Once upon a time in America...Beautiful!,"Two years ago a friend lent me a copy of this movie to watch. Being a Jewish immigrant himself around the same time the movie's earlier setting, he felt that he could relate to it. It took me a long time to finally getting around to watching the movie (being as long as it is) and was MESMERIZED by the different settings, the music (Ahhh...the music!) the story itself and of course, Robert DeNiro! After viewing the film, my friend had a difficult time trying to get it back from me! Sergio Leone has the art of focusing on such important and unimportant details of the settings. I particularly loved the scenes of Deborah dancing among the vegatables in the dusty room. I also thought the first scene of the Chinese theatre was beautiful with the elderly woman's face keeping an eye out for Noodle's safety. And the music fit every scene perfectly. All in all, I have to to say that this is one of my all time favorite films. A true work of Art! Enjoy it when you can."
5,Once Upon a Time in America,"I just saw this film for the first time in its unedited (229-min.) format and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The time spent on character development makes it all worth while. James Woods is in his finest form of any movie I have ever seen him in, including Salvador, and that is saying something. DeNiro is even better, and his part proves why he is considered one of the best actors of the past 30+ years. Then there are all of the supporting actors, who were amazing as well. The fact that this movie didn't win a Best Picture Oscar is one of the great travesties of cinematic justice. That is all."
5,The only gangster film that is also a FILM,"This is the ONLY so called gangster film that is not just a fast moving thriller, where the killings seem just entertainment; it is a FILM. It is about friendship, betrayal and complexity of human emotions. And yes, Craig Bleakley, it HAD TO BE SLOW, because its main goal is to be a psychological drama, not a thriller. By being slow, it forces you not to concentrate on action but on the message of the film. Whoever watches this film needs to be aware of this, and approach it which correct mind set. The main characters of the film could have been shoemakers which almost the same success. The background they were from was chosen mainly to overstress the value of friendship these guys forged in tough circumstances.WARNING: WATCH ONLY THE FULL VERSION. THE CUTTDOWN VERSION FOR DUMMIES IS TOTALLY USELESS AND DOES DISSERVICE TO THIS AWESOME MASTERPIECE."
3,"not a gangster film, but a love story","Robert De Niro and James Woods star in this Sergio Leone flick as two Jewish gangsters, ""Noodles"" and Max, who share a forbidden love for each other that the hyper-macho world they inhabit both creates and scorns. Unable to admit their love, they pursue a series of troubling, violent love affairs (especially Noodles - whose idea of intimacy is rape) with a number of women, whom unfailingly either conform to the stereotypes of the virgin or, more commonly, the whore (the women in this film, oddly enough, are either able to enjoy or forget the times that Noodles rapes them.) By the end of this nearly four hour exploration of unrequited love, Noodles has come to love Max so much that he's unable to take rightful revenge for all the heartbreak and hardship he's caused him. Kudos to Leone, well-known for his tough guy anti-hero films, for having the courage to explore such a taboo subject."
3,"Great cast, but just too long...","Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro in a Sergio Leone mafia movie? Perhaps my expectations were a little too high. Perhaps the great directors lose the masses when given too much reign to create the perfect vision - many say it happened to Kurasawa in Ran. Whatever the cause, this is a 3.5 hour movie that dragged on just a little too much.Great plot, interesting ambiguity of morality and what really happens, plenty of seeing (as opposed to telling) but in the end I wish the vision was condensed. (Although the initial American release was condensed, and that failed too)I'll take the Godfather (or any other De Niro/Pesci flick) over this movie any day of the week."
2,"beautiful film, mediocre ""special edition""","There is no denying that this is one of the great films of all time. That said, the DVD version is a huge disappointment. The ""special features"" include a part of a documentary, commentary by a film critic who isn't particularly qualified to talk about it, and ""cast biographies"" that consist of a still screen listing other films by six or eight actors, including several(Burt Young, Joe Pesci, Treat Williams) who are only on screen for just a few minutes of a 4 hour film. The cut between disc one and disc two is horrible, especially since an ""intermission"" card comes up a few minutes into disc 2. Sloppy, disappointing work. Not worth the greatness of this masterpiece."
3,Too many flashbacks,The movie action was great(I've watched it several times) but I can never figure out the ending. I'll watch it again in a month or two.
3,Could be a better movie,"I watched the near 4 hour version and felt that some parts are still confusing mostly due to the cut from the ""original"" 6 hour version. The ""original"" could be as good as ""The Godfather"" but again why not making a movie as concise as the Godfather ?"
1,Distastefully Grafic,"If the movie had left out the offensive grafic sex scenes, especially with kids involved in sex acts, I could have enjoyed this movie a little bit. I found it revolting to see children playing some of the scenes. I also agree that there wasn't much to the dvd other than the movie itself. There's no point in buying it because you wouldn't want to see it again."
3,"Slow, slow, slow","The best way to view this movie would be with a fellow film buff with whom you could share many long, leisurely dinners (ala Noodles and Deborah) to discuss the story inconsistencies and dead ends, lack of character development, fascinating ""history,"" luscious cinematography, violence, aging makeup gaffes or mystique, and whatever else Leone has thunk up to add to the messy charm of this failed masterpiece. It reminds me of ""Gangs of New York,"" where there were just too many elements for us simple folk to keep track of, so you have to see it more than once, but do you want to spend another four hours of your life in that milieu? Well, yes, I guess, maybe when I'm retired."
5,A Miracle,"To put it briefly is to put it best:Once Upon a Time in America is a miracle. In the ""long"" version, it is a great film--heartbreaking,insightful, and haunting. DeNiro's reticent, meditative character is absorbing. Leone and five other Italian writers composed this story about immigrant Jews on the Lower East Side who become gangsters stretching from the teens to the 60s. It is told largely by gesture, by expression, in the way movies should be made. Leone's microscopic alertness and patience to the unfolding of character in wordless scenes is stunning.Imagine six American writers doing the same about life in Mussolini Rome, say, in the 30s. Impossible.This should be on DVD and I do hope this happens soon; meanwhile, you can catch it on Direct TV at least once a month. You won't forget it."
2,LONG AND DRAWN OUT,WITH AN ALLSTAR CAST YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE SUPER. BUT IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A SLEEPER. THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE! I FELT TORTURED SITTING THROUGH THIS BOMB! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE.
4,A Great Movie,"This film is a profound expression of truth regarding friendship and betrayal. Sergio Leone's masterpiece of growing up in immigrant America is probably one of the first, and finest Leone movies I'd ever seen. I rented some of Leone's other famous works, after seeing this one, and I was equally blown away. James Woods and Robert DeNrio are spectacular as the two friends' whose life in prohibition-era crime inevitably leads to tragedy. Ennio Morricone's score is beautiful and haunting, while Leone's cuts are long and patient. I am a huge fan of gangster movies, and I do recommend this one, as well as Goodfellas, Miller's Crossing, and the Untouchables."
2,Not the best version,"The film is great, really great, but these discs don't do it justice. The extras are pretty non-existent, only an excerpt from a longer documentary about Leone. They should have at least put on the whole thing.The reviewers are right about the annoying break between the discs. I believe it was done for the inclusion of the commentary, but the commentary isn't up to the standard of Sir Christopher Frayling on the ""Dollars"" films, so they needn't have bothered really."
4,very good movie!,okay if you dont like long movies dont watch this one its about3hrs and 49 mins long but each minute better then the last.it is about friends growing up in the underworld and later they go on into bootleging.the only problem with is is the intermission on the 2nd disc bobtec was right about that.but all in all its a good flick
2,Opium Nightmare?,"This flick may be the reason Leone stopped making them. Its framework is apparently a bad trip from smoking opium. Flashbacks and flashforwards make it hard to follow the antihero. The main characters suffer from low self-esteem or worse, especially the women who are submissive to rough sex and other abuse and like it (?) Never thought that female nudity would put me off, but here it's merely gross and rape scenes do not add to any appeal. Treachery and violence and odd cinematography abound for the artsy crowd. The whole mess could be just a series of bad dreams for all the sense many make; protagonists often have no motive and act contrary to their own best interests, selfish though they are depicted."
4,A Genre Top,"A few words on this fine motion picture,""Once upon a time in America"".The chemistry between all the artists is mesmerizing.Shades ofRififi,Good fellas,Score,Millers'Crossing,and so on.DeNir0 and Woods superb.The DVD version should be fascinating."
5,One of the best movies ever,"This is what movies should be. A sweeping epic following interesting, dynamic, and convoluted characters through the hard choices and the difficult events of life and friendship. I was unaware of the edited version of this movie, but if you can't devote for hours to this masterpiece, then you don't deserve to watch it."
1,New version is on the way! Don't buy this BLU-ray!,"The new version is already available with ENGLISH sound. This NEW Italian version runs 250,75 minutes. The added six scenes are visually of more yellowish and lower resolution quality."
4,An excellent picture,"An excellent picture indeed with lots of flashbacks and Twists.An epic tale about the Jewish mafia in N.Y.C. It all centers around 4 childhood freinds who got involved in the mob. DeNiro has an exhilerating performance. Also James Woods was great for supporting actor. Elizabeth Mcgovern plays DeNiros girlfriend.Danny Aiello and William Forsythe have excellent performances that bring to the screen. Even Frank Millileto who is played by Joe Pesci does a brilliant job in Sergio Leones film.Director: Sergio Leone. Cast: Robert DeNiro,James Woods,Elizabeth Mcgovern,Joe Pesci,William Forsythe and Danny Aiello"
4,Extra Noodles,"This is not a review as such, more of a desdperate plea, is there anybody in England or the rest of the United Kingdom with an original copy of this movie that they would be willing to sell. It must be in good condition with original sleeve. I will pay top price for it. My E-Mail address is chrisgotts@Hotmail.com Many thanks."
3,Does the phone really need to ring non stop for the first 15 mins?,I haven't seen this movie in years...now I remeber why. The movie is worth watching if you can make it to the 15 min mark! I just though I'd vent while I'm skipping ahead.
4,Once Upon a Time in America,"Awfully long, but the actors alone would make it a worthwhile movie. The plot kept my interest for the most part, but it is quite a depressing movie."
5,BEST GANG MOVIE EVER MADE? BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!,"I don't say anything...Go and get it!Don't think , don't wait just get it...Note: You not a rich man? don't have a dvd player or video?So, forget it! Go and get Once upon a time in America vcd in realvcd.com (225 min. uncut , 4 disc , laserdisc convert , thx standart)"
3,Disappointing: DD or DTS not working,Everything is right except the sound. Unfortunately the DD or DTS is not working. My amplifier shows DTs or DD but there is nothing coming out from the rear boxes. Disappointing!
2,Once is a long boring movie Not Godfather or Casino quality,"Once wasen't that good at all. I don't think it is even worth the 4hours to watch it. This movie isn't up to the Godfather, Casino, Goodfellas or even A Bronx Tale. Just leave this movie on the rack and forget it. Somes parts in the movie don't make sense. Once is a disappointment."
2,"AMERICA: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY","Sergio Leone is one of the great film directors of all time. Many of his films rank amongst the best films ever made. However, this film is not one of them. It's ugly, it's brutal, it's bloated and more than anything, it's boring. You absolutely do not care enough about ANY of the characters to unravel the mystery that is at the core of this film. Sure, it has good performances and some powerful moments, but this production is just so overblown is that it just so hard to sit through, regardless of how long or short it is."
2,Way too drawn out.,"Good actors and a okay plot - gangland America type stuff. However, it is so long and drawn out that toward the end the only thing that kept me going was I felt like I had to finish just to say I watched the whole thing after invesing three hours already. DeNiro is my faviorit actor, but this role just doesn't give him the material he deserves. This is a rainy-day, stuck in a cabin film at best."
5,One of the Best,"Once Upon a Time in América is undoubtfully one of the best movies ever made. The plot is original, the characteres and the actors just perfect, the photography outstanding. You have to see it at least twice to get all the details."
5,Too Grand For Words,"No review can do this grandiose film justice, but i'll write one anyway. It is a sprawling, beautiful epic that (i cant beleive i'm saying this) really does deserve the title of best the gangster film, maybe the Godfather Trilogy can beat it, but not just one of those films alone. The first viewing the film will seem very long, but on second viewing (or more) the beauty of the movie really comes through, the end with DeNiro & Woods & the score made me get very emotional. If you enjoy gangster films, this is definitley for you, for a Robert DeNiro fan, this is a must. One of the greatest films ever made, 'rarely equalled'also recommend:THE DEER HUNTERGODFATHER TRILOGYSCARFACE"
5,"Awesome Movie, 100 % great","The movie is excellent. The cast is wonderful. I personally love Robert De Niro in this film. it is a true classic of the mob. I am a fan of0 mob movies and this is in the top ten. It is about Jewish kids who grow up in the Bronxs. De Niro is the best man for the movie, to make it 100 percent great. This one of the final movies Sirgio Leone made."
5,Excellent Film!,"Once upon a time in 1984 the director Sergio Leone made his version of a gangster film which in my opinion greatly contrasts the works of cinematic extrimists like Copolla and Scorcese. The movies like ""Casino"", ""Goodfellas"" and even ""Godfather"" are filled with mindless gore, super realism and depressing violence. OUTIA is a film that also has violence, sex, gore, but above all it has emotion and a fairy-tale-like realism which balances all these elements. In fact this movie is like a fairy-tale and yet it is real. The cast and the music are unbelievable. In my opinion both versions of this movie are great."
5,A movie for those who like the story of 'the gangster',I saw this movie (4 hour version) in 1986 on a pay t.v. station. I have watched it once every couple of years since.
2,Great movie - lousy tape transfer,I don't claim that ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is the greatest film ever made but the fact is I enjoy watching it more than any other. I have loved it for years and it seems to improve every time I watch it.I have a PAL version released many years ago in Australia (full length) but I thought I would buy the American release for improved quality. Boy did I get it wrong! The colour balance in the NTSC version currently on offer is ghastly; a green cast over everything and no sign of red anywhere. My 20 year old tape is far better (although the sound isn't as good). My advice is to wait for the DVD release which is said to be on the cards.
2,once upon a time in america,want to see how good 'the godfather 1 and 2 are ? watch this film- beautifully filmed- but a weak story-- ill never watch it again- once was enough-ram
3,Betrayal of course,"Okay of course someone saw that I love Gangsta movies, and books and suggested that this had to be one for the collection.I love Robert DeNiro, and James Wood, and seeing them together cinched it. Okay now with saying that this DVD isn't like the best caliber. The movie is missing something I've watched it a couple of times to see if it were just me and I still have no clue as to who was looking for Noodles. In the middle of the jewelry heist the movie just stops it doesn't say put in next disc.It's sslloooww(...)!Don't get me wrong, I like the flashbacks and how pertinent it is too the present I'd just like to know who in the hell was trying to kill Noodles!My first Jewish mob story it's not way Gangsta but it does hold it's own."
1,Dont buy from this seller: mx_123,a defective item from mx_123this is a good movie. i watched it in a theater when it's out in 1984. i wanted to buy it for a collection. but i got a defective item. and i had to pay the return postage. i lost money.
1,Repelling film,"After watching this movie I sought Maltin's oppinion and immediately agreed with his one star, because the film made me nauseous.From young Noodles sitting in the common toilet to let a girl barge in, to the final scene in the opium parlor where DeNiro grins showing crooked, dirty teeth, this movie is a long series of abominable scenes emphasizing filth and squalor, with plenty of shots of decrepit slums, slubbered dwellings and decaying people.The main characters are a bunch of cruel... ready to cheat, murder and rape at any time. Leone's view of humankind is deranged: junk ready for crunching, as happens in that forlorn scene where we are forced to testify garbage mulching. Civilized life has its down side but it isn't useless. Leone's dim view was entirely biased, if not downright psychotic."
2,Outdated,"This book is from 2007 and if you know anything about technology then you know its outdated. I still study from it but I know there are things that aren't in this book that I will still need to know for the A+ exam. In my opinion, I wish I had spent more money on an updated book.Plus it took like 3 weeks to be delivered from, I believe, WY to MN."
2,Study Guide not Adequate,"I'm a pretty thorough studier, read *every page*, took all the chapters tests, made my own notes, and took all the CD-ROM tests repeatedly... yet only 75% of the material was covered on the test. I passed, but it was only because I had experience in those areas to be able to answer them well enough. I've been off the field for a few years and wanted to take the certification to not only get caught up, but also clear the new exam as well.I was just a little disappointed that the book didn't adequately prepare me as the ""Complete Study Guide"" said it would. There were at least 20-25 questions per exam that were not in the book at all... and to let you know, it takes only 25 questions to miss to fail the exam.The book was a bit disorganized in the new security chapter, and while the rest of the book was organized pretty well... covering only 75% isn't a ""Complete Study Guide"" and unfortunately is worthy of only two stars."
1,Cracked CD/tutorial - Twice!,I ordered this product and the CD was cracked. Ordered a replacement and it was cracked also!Beware!
3,This book is okay.,I would have to say it isn't much better than A+ for dummies but it's not bad. The main thing that really annoyed me is that many large chunks of text are simply repeated verbatim in different sections. The repetition accounts for a good deal of the material in this book. If you can get it at a good discount go ahead but don't pay full price for this book.
3,"Not bad, but be careful","I haven't read through the whole book, but some things already seem off base. For example, a question in the beginning asks the reader to differentiate between a USB 1.0 and a USB 2.0 visually. There IS no difference, (look up a USB cable on Amazon!) but the answer in the book claims that the insulation on a USB 2.0 cable is clear. I feel bad for the newbie who reads this and tries to memorize it. It is a good book, just remember to question whatever doesn't sound right"
5,Loved This Book,"I would highly recommend this book. Not only did it help me pass the exam, it also taught how to apply what I learned to my every-day job.I have to respectfully disagree with the previous review. This was a very comprehensive study guide, and covered all the topics I expected to find on the exam. I thought it was very well organized, followed a logical order, and had the the extras I expect to find from Sybex: Exam Essentials, Hands-on Exercises, Review Questions, and so on.It was also very easy to read. Unlike some books--Mike Meyer's for one--the authors are not pompus or over the top. They are straight forward, not making any assumptions about the reader's intelligence or sense of humor."
4,Good value for money,"Sybex has published quality study guides for years and this book is no exception. The PC hardware and Windows information in this book maps very well to the 2006 CompTIA A+ exams and provides ""above and beyond"" coverage of printer troubleshooting, networking, and network security. Unlike other books of its kind, this may have value as a reference once you pass the A+ tests, especially if you are considering other related CompTIA certifications. The absence of an introduction, its textbook-like tone, and minor errors on some practice questions are why I withhold my fifth star... the book is not perfect, but it is quite good.This book is available by itself or as a part of theCompTIA A+ Complete Certification Kit; let price and your own experience with PC troubleshooting determine which is the best value for you."
4,Works as intended,"Used this to fix a stripped oil drain plug on my EX300. Installed quickly and worked perfect. Haven't removed the plug since, so time will tell."
4,Very good,"I have heard a lot of bad reviews of the OBCR and the show, but I don't agree. I haven't seen the show yet, but I plan too. However, I am in love with the soundtrack. Josh Strickland's voice is amazing, as well as the rest of the cast. The songs are very catchy and I really like it. I esp. love ""Who Better Than Me' and ""Different"". ""For the First Time"" is the love ballad of the CD, but is actually one of my least favorite songs on the albulm. It's good, but I think others are much better. ""Sure as the Sun Turns to the Moon"" is so sweet and Kala's voice is wonderful. Definitely check this out!"
5,Cool,This music is awesome. I love the show. And I love the music.If you see the Brodway show than you have to buy this music cd.Great music.Also it arrived in time.
3,What is Disney on Broadway doing?,I do not know what is going on with the Disney Company. The music is so-so. I am not in any rush to see the show
3,"Some high points, many low ones...","First of all, I have to say that I love the movie soundtrack. Ironically, the movie songs here are by far the best ones. And, surprisingly enough, Tarzan's singing (Josh Strickland) is the strongest. Kerchak's (sp?) voice is plain annoying and Jane sounds like a past-her-prime Julie Andrews. Frankly, I'm disappointed with the voices of the cast."
5,I just don't understand..,"I just don't understand why this show got so many bad reviews... I went in NY to see it with my 12 years old daughter, and we loved it! And we are not alone, for sure. The theater was full and everybody there had obviously a great time.Every songs got their strong applause! Standing ovation with a long and strong applause at the end!It was a amazing beautiful and touching show. The songs are just perfect and so brilliantly written by Phil Collins.We bought the cd as well and we just love it."
5,Great cast recording and show,"I saw this show may 18th, it was absolutly amazing. The cast, acting and everything. I just bought the cast recording, it sounds amazing."
2,Not That Good,Friends talked me into this show because it was for kids. Too bad it was only for kids.
1,One of the Awful Musicals of 2005,"2005 has been a very slow year for musicals. With shows like Lennon, Lestat, The Musical of Musicals: The Musical, Hot Feet, Ring of Fire etc. Tarzan is one of the worst musicals i have seen in a while. The music is absolutly aweful! The script has many, many problems, acting is mediocre. (One thing that made me mad, is how you could see that Tarzan was wearing a harness and how the vines had carrabeaners on them.) The songs have no meaning, escpecially ""Two Worlds"" This is a song that tries to be metaphorical and cute and ""real"" but it is pure nothing. Dont buy this album or tickets to this shoow unless you like wasting youre money. (by the way, the set of Tarzan looks like the set of a lowsy high school play."
1,Awful,"Phil Collins has written a banal, stupid, unmemorable, often uneven score for this Disney dreck musical, Tarzan. His lyrics do not rhyme at all. They often try, but do not work. His music is bland and highly unmemorable. The actor playing Tarzan, Josh Strickland sounds like Cher and Jenn Gambatesse as Jane needs to work on her English accent. The orchestrations sound incredibly synthesized. Nothing acoustical, nothing brassy, nothing remotely good. (Poor work by a usually wonderful Doug Besterman).The show itself is far worse than this CD. The costumes and scenic production are incredibly tacky and lame looking. The book is highly cliched and structured quite poorly. This is a cast album filled with awful music from an awful show. If you wish to hear unmemorable music, bad performers and dreadful lyrics, buy this album. If not, please do not. You won't regret it."
2,PRETTY BAD BUT BETTER THAN DROWSY CHAPERONE,"This is not the worst Broadway score this year (that goes to Drowsy Chaperone), but there's not too much good to say about it...and they ruined ""You'll Be In My Heart""!"
4,Amazing vocals in a fun show!,"I've seen this show 3 times already and love the soundtrack. In general I do not think the new songs are as strong or memorable as the original movie songs - with the exception of For the First Time. Merle Dandridge (Kala) has an amazing voice, but the real show stopper here is Josh Strickland as Tarzan. Every time he sings he nearly takes my breath away. The Who Better Than Me (Reprise) really showcases his voice - albeit for a brief moment in time. We keep going back for you Josh! See it before the original cast leaves.P.S. To the person who said there was no pit orchestra, I can assure you there is as I've sat in the front row each time."
1,Absolutely Dreadful,"Frankly, I think the headline says it all, but this Phill Collins-penned score could have been so much more. Shame on you Disney!"
3,Only A Couple of Good Songs,"There is something very amateurish sounding about this score. The actor's voices are fine, but nothing you'd expect of a Broadway spectacular. Even the great ""You'll Be In My Heart"" doesn't capture the magic of Phil Collin's movie version.Unfortunately, Mr. Collin's songs, with new ones added specifically for the stage version, simply do not compare with the scores of other Disney productions. Best songs include:Two WorldsWaiting For This MomentEverything That I Am (probably the best song on the cd)There is nothing dreadful about this cd, but rather it simply focuses on the target audience (children), leaving adults wanting something a bit more."
2,"""Aida"" & ""Lion King"" Much Better Disney Scores","This music was fairly uninteresting. ""Aida"" & ""The Lion King"" represent much richer Disney scores."
4,Good book for teaching teens how to communicate.,"This is my 31 year old son's review.I purchased this book for Interpersonal Communication in College, it was fun to read, and full of interesting thought provoking material. It is writing in such a way that anyone can understand it.I think that if this book was taught in 6th Grade that there would be less confusion during the teenage years and divorces rates would be down. Excellent book for those beginning psychology. All parents should read this and have discussions about it with their children before they think that they know everything and wont listen to you.I think that the book needs to go more in depth with how to change self perceptions, fallacies, and self fulfilling prophecies. This could be improved by adding the 36 thinking errors, and common dysfunctional schemas. It is one thing to point out flaws in interpersonal communication, but without giving a solution it is pointless. Over all a good book."
3,older edition for less,"I always try to save on my textbooks. I bought an older edition of this book and it worked fine for my class, the chapters were slightly off but I just double checked the chapter titles with the syllabus."
1,Misleading Title,"Was very disappointed when I received 'Cram101 Textbook Outlines' to accompany ""Looking Out Looking In"". I thought I had ordered the book ""Looking Out Looking In"". Very misleading when purchasing this. I don't know if something was listed wrong or not, but when ordering I usually type in the ISB # to find the book I need. Somehow I got the Looking Out... Textbook Outlines."
4,The previous edition is practically the same,I would have rated this book 5 stars but the previous edition is practically the SAME. I got the previous edition for $5 off eBay and passed the class with an A.
3,Bought for school,"Bought this book for school, not sure I learned anything from it that wasnt tought in the other 10 interpersonal classes ive had to take throughout school!"
4,Good Seller,"Had a problem getting a response from the seller, wanted to cancel product but seller did not respond until the book was already sent 1 week later! Will not buy from them again. Returned the book and still awaiting refund."
2,Will never purchase from Amazon's used dealers again,"Textbook, as described. What can I say? It's a textbook. The actual purchase of the book was a hassle. Used book dealer never returned emails or sent any communications. I almost had to buy a 2nd copy of this text. Which I couldn't afford. Amazon's guarantee service would not help until 3 days after the expected delivery date, 21 days after purchase. It could have taken an additional 2wks+ to get my money back if it hadn't arrived. I will never use Amazon's used book dealers again."
5,Got what I paid for,"When the book arrived it was within the time frame predicted I found the used book described on Amazon. No complaints, no negative press. Thanks."
5,A highly recommended communication book,"Upon viewing the contents of the book, it seems to be exactly what is needed for better communication and an enhanced outlook on viewing other person's perspective. I highly recommend it to anyone."
1,Not happy!!!!!!,"Good MorningI order this book went to class the professor said didn't need the book that same evening i came straight the the computer within a matter of two hours cancel the orders and they sent the book to me anyway. As a matter of fact I order two books the other they cancel but ""looking out looking in still sent the book I'm stuck with a book I can't use that's not fair I sent an email to the ""seller"" to cancel in other words they sent it any way. Not a happy camper right that's how i feel and that's my review.Thanks"
1,"WARNING: Kindle Edition Missing Significant Parts of Book Due to ""Copyright Restrictions""","I got this book for a course I am taking. Unfortunately, there are several excepts and related material that are omitted from the Kindle edition due to ""Copyright Restrictions"". The book itself is quite good, but if you end up being quizzed on or otherwise need these sections, you may be caught with your proverbial pants down. I wonder how long before publishers realize that these hassles are often the reason why people don't trust purchasing digital material.Amazon should NOT sell this as the ""Kindle Edition"" of the printed book without at least clearly advertising that the book is missing material."
4,Textbook,"It has a clear organization, and interesting insets. For a textbook, it intrigues. The comic inserts are a tip of the hat to culture, and everything is up-to-date."
2,WAY overpriced** see details!,"Let me first be clear, I do not actually own THIS book. What I own is the ""Looking Out, Looking In"" 12 ENHANCED EDITION.What is this ENHANCED EDITION you ask?? It is this item, ""Looking Out, Looking In"" 12th edition AND the ""Student Activities Manual for Adler/Proctor/Townes's Looking Out, Looking In 12th Edition"" PUT TOGETHER IN ONE BOOK!!Seriously why buy this if your going to have to buy the ""Student Activities Manual for Adler/Proctor/Townes's Looking Out, Looking In 12th Edition""anyway?!?When you buy these books seperately, from Amazon even, it is over $160I just happened to notice this was sold different from my book and thought it was just ludicrous that these book companies try to gouge all the money they can from people.This is the ISBN of my book: 0-495-46819-3 Feel free to check it if you don't believe me.The more you know!!!"
4,Purchased for one track only,"Wanted the track ""Come together"" for years, and love the guitar backing this vocal. Haven't bothered with the remaining tracks."
2,Backpack is noisy,I was looking for a backpack that would fit a tall person and have enough space for 1-2 day trip. I wanted enough adjustments to be able to use the backpack for shorter trips.This backpack looked great for my purpose.When I got it I found it fit me well. It turned out to be reasonable size and had many adjustments to customize it to load.Unfortunately the material is very plasticy & it constantly rustles when you walk. I tried using it a few time but I noticed that I was always conscious of the noise. People & animals could hear me coming.I eventually replaced it with an Osprey Atmos 50.
2,Watchband Nightmare,"The watchband is a completely ridiculous travesty! Impossible to put on, and if you accomplish that feat, impossible to stay on. This gift was an anxiety provoking nightmare! I really tried to work with it, but to no avail. I returned it, regretfully. It is/was a quite handsome watch."
2,inconvenient and untrusty bracelet,"This watch's bracelet brusied my arms and when I went homt to give this to my father as a gift, he lost it within a week, the lock is not so trusty and that's a money down the drain"
1,Skagen band good luck finding one.,Overall its a nice watch.but if you need a new band good look on finding one.I went to at leased 10 stores all of them said skagen there are no bands available.so I had to get a new watch.....
4,Gift for Husband,He loves it because it is thin and lightweight. Even he figured out how to adjust the band and close it--and that's without reading the instructions! (Men! ;) )
4,Great watch!,"This is definitely a good quality watch. Like most other reviewers, I'm not too crazy about the clasp. The watch itself is very thin and inconspicuous. If the clasp were of higher quality, I would give this watch a 5 star rating. If you have small wrists like me, I suggest you give the Skagen brand a try. You won't be disappointed."
5,nice watch,"The watch was a gift for my 21yr old brother. It's beautiful. It's smaller than most mens watches and the design is sleek. The seller, MY TIME PEICE, was very helpful, responsive. I'm pleased."
5,SKAGEN,My skagen watch is an incredible value. Amazon has become a new place for me to find great values like my beautiful skagin watch. Many people have commented on my watch.it is a quality watch for the reasonable price.
1,pretty damn upset,This watch malfunctioned within a 30 day period. I will never buy a watch from Amazon again. This is the second malfunctioned watch I bought in the last 45 days
4,looking good,"recieved the Skagen 233L was send straight away, very well packed thought bought 20 watchs but was full of padding, took few minutes to work out the claspput on at work, already had complements looks good different to any of the other watches Ive had, the black mesh strap, and blue face, better than the picture"
5,Great Watch,"This is my third Skagen watch and the look of this watch is fantastic. I read the reviews before I bought it and they are correct, the pictures do not do it justice. I would recommend this watch to anyone who has style and enjoys comfort and compliments."
4,Good watch,Got the watch for Christmas and have enjoyed it so far (only a week). The strap adjusts pretty easily and the watch is light and thin.
4,"Reliable, attractive watch.","Have been wearing this watch for approx 10 days. It keeps time accurately, and has been complimented by family as looking great. I was leary of purchasing this watch, because of fear that the metal mesh band would pull my hair. It doesn't. It is comfortable, lets my skin breath, and best of all, does NOT pull hair. Comfortable to wear, lightweight, and looks attractive while keeping accurate time. For the price, this is a very good watch. One minor criticism: A day/date function would be a cool addition to the face. However, for attractive, functional simplicity, you can't beat it."
3,Just okay.,"It's not a bad watch for the price.A few issues that my husband had with it.... Firstly it's very thin. Some may like that but it makes the watch more susceptible to breaking.Number two.... My husband has a big hand and big wrist and it looked ""too small"" on his wrist. It just didn't suit him and a few people pointed that out.Like I said, it's not a bad watch but why not add a little more money and invest in something less fragile."
5,Item was a gift.,"My son had picked this out and was well pleased upon receipt of it. Very handsome watch. It hasn't been in use long so don't know about battery life, etc."
3,Like Everything But The Clasp,"I've had this watch for about six months and, overall, have been fairly happy with it. I like the looks of the watch, with its rather unusual blue dial, and find it easy to read. It also keeps excellent time. The only thing I do not like is the clasp. It's a little difficult to put on and the bottom tends to get scratched and, sometimes, caught on things. It has also come loose a couple of times, and I do not find it easy to tighten.In all, I like the watch but if I bought it again I'd look for a regular clasp."
4,Great watches for the price,"I love my Skagen watches. They are comfortable, subtle, and sleek. The metal mesh bands are really comfortable, and they look great for a long time, unlike other watches in this price range. Only drawback to all this elegance is the general lack of a second hand."
2,Mesh Band Does Not Hold Up Well,"I bought this watch for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loved the watch, I loved the watch, everybody loved the watch. He would get comments on it from friends, co-workers and complete strangers. It's a great looking watch for the price.Now the watch is about 4 months old and the band has developed snags in it that catch on clothing. He's already ruined two shirts.I'm going to try to see if I can find another band for it, but I'm really disappointed. Granted he does wear it every day, but a watch band should hold up for more than 4 months."
2,Don't even consider it for everyday wear.,"This is a nice-looking watch that I got as a gift for my husband. He received lots of compliments on it, and if I was rating it on his impression in the first months of owning it then this would have been a five star review for sure. Now I feel a little guilty that his last big gift from me didn't last out the year.After about six months, the black finish was starting to wear off around the edges. After eight months, a tiny link from the mesh band broke near the join of the band and watch body, we had to cut and file at the band (leaving an ugly mark) in order to keep the band from scratching up his wrist. Less than a month after that, he found that the crystal was broken after a normal office workday. The warranty covers none of these things.My husband really loved the watch, but it's just not good enough quality to hold up and you can't count on the warranty."
2,Not so timely,"Great looking watch, and even though earlier reviews spoke to the band eventually snagging clothing, etc, I took a chance and ordered it. Found it ran unacceptably slower than I wanted.Was pleased with how easy it was to return & receive a refund from Amazon."
5,Top Rated,This is one of the most attractive watches that I ever purchased. Very thin dial light weight and a good price.
3,Amazing watch...Issue with Clasp,"Well..I have had this watch for almost 7 months now & its really amazzing, light & has caught attention pretty quickly. I would have given it 5/5 if not for its clasp. The Clasp has worn out quite a bit in the 6 months & looks dull steel instead of jet black. I am hoping they would be good enough to provide a replacement to have my faith restored."
4,"nice watch, tough to adjust wrist strap","The watch was even thinner than I expected and is comfortable to wear. The only difficulty I had was adjusting the strap to fit my wrist - you need a small screwdriver to pry open one part, and I slightly bent a small rod that the other part of the clasp latches onto. However all's well so far. One thing to note is there is no seconds hand so at one point, probably when one of my kids got a hold of it, the adjustment knob was pulled out so I didn't notice it wasn't keeping time until the next morning when I adjusted it and pushed the knob back in.All in all, a nice simple stylish watch."
1,Nice design but low reliability,"8 months after I purchased this watch, the watch strap came off from its joining location with the watch. Although this watch has an amazing look and design, it is not reliable. Since I cannot use any other watch strap for this model, currently I cannot use the watch."
2,"Beautiful, but poorly manufactured","Great looking, thin and lightweight watch. Unfortunately, the crystal spontaneously cracked after a little more than 6 months. Apparently, that is a common problem with this watch and this brand lately. Luckily, Amazon was able to refund my purchase. My previous Skagen Titanium watch lasted 5-6 years, so I am unsure if I will purchase another one."
2,You're better off with a Timex...,I bought a Skagen watch because it looks great. I paid $100 for it from one of the department stores. From the day I bought it the watch has lost about 10 to 15 minutes a day. I thought it was the battery so I replaced it for $10 but that didn't help. In order to get it repaired I had to send it to them via special delivery which cost me $12 more. I checked my mail today and they sent me a letter asking for $8.95 for the cost of repairs or else I won't get the watch back. I'm trying to figure out why I'm being asked to pay for repairs for a watch that is clearly under warranty. I'll be calling them tomorow to find out. In the meantime.. don't buy a Skagen watch unless you like cheap junk and lousy service.
5,"Excellent, but band color wears","I got this watch about a year ago, and absolutely love it. As a high-schooler, It gets a little wear and a few small scratches on the face, but overall it is quite durable.One problem is the band. The black coloring wears off, leaving a gross silver color underneath.Overall, an excellent watch"
2,Watchband lock is a poor design,Great difficulty opening and closing the watchband. Too much time and trouble to open & close; not a good design.The face and watch itself is very nice.
4,Beautiful Watch,"I absolutely love this watch. Like others have said, it's such a light and thin watch that you forget you're wearing it until others comment on how nice of a watch it is! The only downside is that it's difficult to clean the chain link band. Also, be careful not to crack the glass; it's a delicate beauty."
5,Great watch!,"Anyone looking for a watch to buy this is one ! Its causal, small, thin, tough, and above all eye catching. I currently reside in Washington D.C. and I take the metro to work. Many people have stop and compliment my watch. So, if you want something that attractives attentnion, and goes perfectly well in most outfits, i strongly recommend this watch. Another plus side is the price. You don't have to spend over $100 for one good looking watch. As far as negative stuff goes on this watch, nothing at all. I've had it for about one month"
2,Doesn't last,"When I recieved this watch about 9 months ago, I thought it was beautiful! You can just stare at the electric blue face forever. You can't feel the watch on your wrist it is so light. The band is extremely comfortable, the whole watch is extremely thin!After about 7 months, the battery died. I had the battery replaced by an authorized dealer. Since then the watch works, then it stops. It can work for a week, or a month, or a day, then by some mysterious reason, it stops. I had it looked at by the dealer. He told me that the watch would have to be sent out with a fee for shipping, and insurance.After reading a few reviews, I don't think I'll send it out since so many people have numerous problems with the band and battery. If I didn't experience this problem, it would defenitely been at least a 4 star.It is really a shame, because that face is awsome!"
2,Beauty is only skin deep,"Though a devout Rolex man, I still fell for the elegant beauty of the radiant blue dial smoothly merged into that slender black band. But, alas as with some women, the beauty was only skin deep. It quit running after less than a year, with only about ten nights out on the town. A new battery provided a short rebound relationship with time, but the same inevitable result. Now i have to shell out postage + $9 for repair of a watch that should have worked in the first place. Doesn't sit well with me. But they don't make a black Rolex... The Danish are too laid back for precision anyway, leave it to the swiss or japanese..."
1,very poorly made,"DO NOT BUY THEIR WATCHES, SAVE TIME AND grief poorly made, the strap fell apart within a week to 10 days, Amazon has good customer support , i will not exchange, just a refund"
1,Eh.,"At first my wife loved the watch I got for her for Christmas. It has been less than 6 months, and half of the medal is already faded, and the battery is dead. That is absolutely ridiculous. Will be complaining and trying to either get a new watch or getting my money back. What a horrible Xmas gift. Thanks a lot!"
1,Poor Quality,"My wife bought this watch as a gift to me. It was an attractive, light-weight watch that I prefer. Between the two of us we could not get the clasp to stay on. I was disappointed as was she. We returned the watch to the seller. The seller called my wife asking her to have me take down my review on their product. I only wrote the truth. They also told her the clasp worked fine for them when they recieved it back. They offered a refund plus a refund of the return shipping charges. That was fine but I would not retract my review on their product. The clasp did not work. To disparage my wife and I over the product defect was not what I'd call very good customer service. Hey, products can be faulty. I'm not saying the whole Skagen brand is faulty, just the watch we recieved."
1,Skagen 233LTMN watch,"I bought this watch because it is slim and stylish. However, it did not function out of the box. I had to take it to a jeweler to verify that the battery worked and watch did not. I called Skagen and they said I had to ship it back to then, at my expense, This for a new, non-working product!This has been a very negative experience with a lot of hassle and I still do not have a watch. I would not buy this product again."
1,"Beautiful watch, nightmare band and clasp - Returned","Basically, it is a beautiful watch, but I would stay away from it, I returned mine and here is why.1. The band is very stiff you cannot budge it which makes it feel like it will breakat any time, and reading the reviews... this is the case.2. The clasp is an absolute nightmare. The inside clasp does not hold, and the other does not either,so it's simply a cute design that looks good on paper but not strong enough in practice. It kept falling off.3. The hands have a green inlay as if it would glow, but they don't, and there is no light.4. There is no second hand which isn't a big deal really.This watch needs a new band, a rethink, if they could change these things, I'd buy it again, but until then,all I can say is stay away."
3,skagen men's watch,"The watch is beautiful, sleek and stylish. The only drawback is it is hard to do up the clasp. After you do it for a while it becomes easier, but it is not all that user friendly. The watch, however, is beautiful and is sure to draw attention and comments."
5,Lookin' good !,"This watch is super thin and the blue color is striking. It bring comments from people who notice it. The latch assembly is different but once you get use to it, it stays put and becomes easier to put on every day."
4,simple slim watch,Quite slim. Looks well made. Strap is metal but in black looks a little like plastic. Cant see it in the dark. Overall pleased with it so far.
3,very nice watch,"It seems to be very nice watch with basic functions, however I receive one with 2 issues, it is minor now but could well be major later.+ both hinges that connect the mess band to the case were bend, not straight as usual, this could bad if it got bend too far so that pins will pop out.+ the needles' aren't luminous at night at all.I give it a few more night, if not getting any better, this will be back to Amazon."
3,nice style but the thing is brittle,"Santa bought this for me in 2009. The only problem is that the watch's band and buckle are extremely delicate. This surprised me as the watch is made of titanium. A few of the weaved wires composing the band have actually snapped in half and are unraveling. The broken pieces catch the cuffs of my long-sleeve shirts and jackets, which is highly irritating. I refuse to pay an exorbitant amount of money for another band, so if the band becomes entirely ruined then I will just purchase another watch."
2,Crystal cracked on first day of wear!,"Nice watch, but the face cracked all the way across on my first day wearing it. I was at the mall with my wife and baby, so I don't think there was any impact that should've been an issue for the ""super hardened"" crystal. The features on the watch are nice, but I'm obviously disappointed with the durability."
4,Great watch.,"This is a great watch. It is the thinest watch I've ever seen, and is so light you forget you even have it on."
5,Nice watch,Arrived timely and looks great!! Very thin and stylish. Reflects a beautiful blue shimmer in all lighting. Easy to read and feels like nothing on your wrist. Very happy with this purchase!!
5,Skagen Men's Titanium Black Mesh Watch,I already had the same watch in silver. I've had it for 4 or 5 years and was completly happy with it. I just wanted one in black so I bought the same one as I already have. These watches are a real bargain.
2,Doesn't stand up over time.,"This watch is great when you first get it. It looks sleek, and its very lightweight. Over a few months however, it has several major problems and I will never buy one again. First the band conforms to your wrist and becomes slanted or curved because your wrist is thicker on one end. The glass on the watch face gets scratched very easily. I actually take my watch off if I am doing something that might damage it, and it still became scratched from just regular wearing."
4,"Great watch!!! Sleek, Classy and Handy!","I love this watch! This is a wonderful design. The first thing I like is that it is very sleek, very thin and light design, and almost feels weight less on the hand. The look is stunning as well, dark black with the shiny blue dial - like a designer watch on turbo!"
4,Skagen Black Titanium Watch,Very classy watch. No problem with ordering and receiving watch. Small problem with clasp but should be easily corrected.
5,perfect dress watch..black and charming,"I have read lots of review here in amazon.and I needed a dress watch ..so I bought this item..first of all I have metal allergy to nickel ,iron , cadmium and other else elements..this watch is titanium and there is no allergy now..I am happy..watch is very thin and very light...it is perfect match with your wrist and shirt...and for the very big handed and big wrist persons we dont advice this item for you...it is too elagant for a man wrist...just buy this..no regrets"
1,Crystal cracked,"After about a month of ownership of this beautiful watch, I went into HyVee's beer refrigerator for 30 minutes. I was diligently choosing beers I was curious about. I then walked outside into a hot, humid day. I drove home. During the drive, I begun to hear a cracking sound. I wasn't sure where it was coming from, but it was near.After I arrived home, I looked at my watch to see the crystal was cracked right down the middle. In fact, to my horror, I got to see it crack one last time.The watch still works great. I plan on getting it repaired. Unfortunately, the one item that's not under warranty is the crystal."
4,So light you won't know it's there,First time for a Skagen. The height profile is so low and the titanium so light weight you hardly realize it's on your wrist. The face does seem to scratch easily and the black finish on the clasp has started to rub off ...in just a few weeks. I attribute that to my wrist wresting on my desk at work...spend many hours each day working on a PC. Nice watch for work..but you have to be careful as it gets marked and scuffed pretty easily...and being black it's noticeable. Silver might have been a better choice.
3,quality issue,"First, I like the watch.Second, I like the watch.Third, I like the watch.Why? It's light, thin, looks good, reads well, and I hardly know it's there. As for the clasp, yes its a little clumsy, so if you're a klutz, look for another style.So what's the problem? Inside the crystal, there is a very thin, almost imperceptible wire gasket of some sort that delamnated from the perimeter housing. It started small and within a month or so, collided with the hands, and brought the timing mechanism to a halt. ""Please enclose $8.95 to cover return postage, insurance and handling."" When you factor in my shipping cost, time and $8.95, I think you understand my rating. Nevertheless, I found a box, made out a check, and am trekking off to the post office. C'est la vie."
4,Good watch,I love my watch the only thing I mildly dislike is the clasping mechanism. It comes loose too easily and too often
3,Not what we expected,"The watch arrived quickly. My husband has a large wrist. He didn't wear it because he could see that it wasn't going to work for him. We hadn't seen the return policy - 15%/up to $25 to cover shipping and Amazon commissions (plus we pay the return postage). Amazon should not charge commissions on returned items, so that seems a bit unfair to the seller. However, we are concerned about the return policy. Even though I have had emails with them, the policy feels to me that it is written in a way that causes me question. The seller did tell me in an email that they usually have allowed returns. We are deciding how to handle this. It is a beautiful watch, but not sized for a man with a large wrist."
5,Really great looking watch,I had a Skagen before and I liked it a lot but it had a leather band and it eventually got a little worn so wanted to get a new watch. Took a look at Amazon figuring I would probably get a good deal here and I did. My first watch was around $125 at a jeweler and this watch was like $67 including shipping so it was a great deal in comparison.It's a very thin and elegant watch - the face changes from a cobalt blue to black as you turn it - it's actually pretty striking and I've had several really nice compliments on it in the few weeks I've worn it. Diggin the 2 year warrantly as well. Whoo hoo - What's not to like ???
3,Well darn,"When I first read the other reviews and saw the complaints regarding the cracked facing, I assumed that the writers were omitting their own carelessness. So, I went ahead and purchased the watch since I like analog types and thought the style was quite striking. When I recieved it I tried to register my watch but the Skagen website wouldn't let me complete the registration. It was 1 week to the day of recieving the watch that I noticed a crack on the facing. All very wierd and terribly disappointing. It is a shame since it is a really nice watch, and even though Skagen will replace it (assuming I can ever get it registered) I expected a little more resilience from a $70.00 watch, even if it is a dress watch."
2,Crappy strap,"I really liked the look of this stylish watch so I ordered it. I still like the looks of the slim design, and blue face, but the strap ruins it. It doesn't lock together properly, and I'm constanly having to make sure it hasn't fallen off my wrist. Yes, it has actually fallen off my wrist. It sucks that I have to pay shipping to return this, but I guess those are the risks of buying something like this off the internet. DON""T BUY THIS ITEM, or any other SKAGAN watch with a similar strap."
3,"Very technical, at times heavy reading","This is a down'n'dirty book on how to create a complete Pascal compiler. The book is heavily loaded with massive amounts of code, code which is at times very repetitive, since the author keeps improving on his classes time after time, writing the complete class code each time. If you can read C++ code as well as english, this is a great book to learn every detail about creating a compiler.The book also cover alot of interesting off-topics, such as programming technique and code management. It is quite obvious that Roald Mak is a very gifted programmer.I would not recommend this book to anyone who hasn't been doing regular C++ programming for at least 2-3 years. But then again, who else would care about creating their own compilers? ;)"
1,you all are nuts!---first edition is C NOT C++!!!!,"Every previous review is obviously about the second edition, much later than 1991. This is the FIRST EDITION!!! There is absolutely no C++ in this book. All the programs are written in C, just plain C. And who knows what C. I can't find any C compiler that will compile any of these programs without errors. So it's just much wasted effort!!!"
3,Teletype and paper tape,"There were several editions of this book. I helped test the programs for one edition, using a Teletype attached to a Heathkit computer at Creative Computing magazine (that was the best printer we had). It would be interesting to see some of these books from the very early days of personal computing reprinted. This was still six years before the IBM PC came out and brought the first standardized and affordable diskette format into use!"
3,Great for Classic Gamers that want to learn how to program,"Using Dartmouth BASIC, this book has 101 Text Only BASIC Games that are good for BASIC Programmers looking to learn how to write simple games. The BASIC code can be converted to any Microsoft BASIC Computer like the old TRS-80, Apple //, Commodore Vic-20 and 64, Atari 400/800/etc, Coleco ADAM, and so on.Classic Games include Eliza, Hunt The Wumpus, and more!I wish this book was in stock, it is a classic! A real part of history as in how games used to be before we had graphics and object oriented programming! It might never be reprinted. If anyone finds where the source code for these games are on the Internet, please e-mail me the location, as I want to try them."
3,confusing label,labeling says one serving has 11 grams of fat but less than one gram saturated. since most of the fat comes from coconut oil the saturated fat should be quite high like in comparable banana chip products. i called them and emailed them about this. they said they'd get back to me but never did. i love their banana chips but the labeling is definitely incorrect about the saturated fat content.
3,Simple repair book,"This is a general book to help with high level maintenance. If you have an older truck and need help finding where to change the fluids, this book is helpful.Not a real shop manual by a stretch."
2,S-10 manual,"Very disappointed in this manual. The book seller was great, arrived on time and in great condition but the manual itself leaves a lot to be desired. Disorganized and worthless photo illustrations, I had to buy the Chiltons manual as well. A much better book. My Haynes manual will be donated to the local library where it will gather dust instead of in my garage."
1,I mad mistake?,"i thought it was brand knew? but I was wrong, I got mechanical finger print's in it! and the book was bent in half"
3,No 4 wheel drive information.,It is ok how ever the reason I wanted it was for the 4 wheel drive information it said it had not so.
4,"Good, but damaged upon arrival","This seems like a fine cover for this phone. Protects in all the right places and adds minimal thickness overall to the phone. The removable knob for the belt clip is a nice feature.Only drawback so far is that mine arrived with a damaged snap for the flip cover. Part of the snap was crushed and missing. It does snap, but easily pops open. I'm not assuming this is a defect in the product, but rather a fluke with the one I received. Not worth hassle of returning, though. These are so cheap, I'll use until it stops working and just order another one."
3,a one hit wonder -- but what a hit!,"Dawn Penn has a reputation as a one hit wonder -- her performance of ""No, No, No"" is mesmerizing, and it went to the top of the charts twice -- in the 1960s when first recorded, and then again in this 1994 remake (which appears in two different mixes on this disk). But after ""No, No, No"" the rest of the material is pretty undistinguished, even working with several production teams. She has a good voice, and apparently could get steady work as a backing singer, but she seems to lack the personality or charisma to really shine as a solo artist -- except on that one song. One might want to skip this disk and obtain a recording of ""No, No, No"" off a collection."
3,"Good collection, covers many topics","The Archbishop Desmond Tutu has been one of the foremost spokesmen for political religion in our times (whatever Pat Robertson may think). This collection of various speeches he gave brings his personality into focus - that of a deeply spiritual man interesting in his country and his people. None of the selections are overly long though some I thought got a bit repetitive (sp?). Divided into several sections, this book is probably of use to those interested in the political-religious intersection as well as those who like to read books of quotes. I am not one of the latter, but the fact that this book appealed to me speaks well of it."
5,An excellent addition to your library.,"This book is excellent value. No matter what your views on the brain, psychology or evolution, this book gets the non-specialist up-to-date on the latest findings with a wealth of data and beautiful illustrations. For the information it provides, plus keeping you abreast of some cutting edge research, you cannot go wrong with this one."
4,A useful visual view of the brain and affect development,"I am ordering this book for our Library to support a postgraduate course in pastoral counselling. This course has an emphasis on self psychology and affect development. ""Mapping the Mind"" provides a visual view of the brain and brain development and explains the processes of the brain in language which is accessible to people with social science and humanities backgrounds. One of the subjects in our course is the Psychology of Religious Experience and includes some focus on affect development. ""Mapping the Mind"" offers physiological and neurological information and this which supports an understanding of affect and feelings."
5,I can feel my brain working when I read this book.,"Review from an information architect's point of view. This book does very nicely for my ongoing research to further understand myself and others as human. It's written in great detail, beautifully and clearly illustrated, and written for laymen like me.It's a continuous treat to recall and observe your own behavior, either online or on the road, and apply it to the way your brain works. It's one of the few times when ""looking into yourself"" isn't purely philosophical."
5,Mapping the Mind,"Written with amazing insight, this book takes Neurophysiology from sleep-inducing to fascinating. The book is an interesting read for anyone, with great pictures and anecdotes. I would recommend it to anyone looking to understand the brain."
5,A Truly Outstanding Book,"This is a truly outstanding book. I thought it would be all fluff, but it was incredibly informative. Much better than anything else I have seen out there, AND it was immensely readable. A true pleasure to read."
3,Fine,"This helps organize all my girlfriends irons and straighteners which was why I got it; however, it doesn't stand the heat well. The heat hasn't done damage to the outside of the holsters yet but the inside has definitely been chard. I also was disappointed with the base. I thought it would be heavier or have a bottom that wasn't metal, because it unfortunately slides around the counter-tops really easy. Now I'm worried my attempt at organizing her hair stuff will end in the expensive Chi I got her crashing to the floor."
4,great item but!!!!,"I really like the look of this product but when I recieved my holder the main bolt to put it together was not there I went and had to buy one to be able to use it, I'am ordering another one for my co-worker because she really likes mine I hope it's all there next time."
2,TOO EASY TO DISMANTLE,"We bought this for our grandson's second birthday. My husband put it together and basically before he had moved away from it our grandson had taken all the parts off. No matter how hard my husband push on the pieces to ""click"" them in they would easily be pulled out. Our grandson loved the basic concept of driving the cars up and down the drive but the ramp wasn't there because he had easily unhooked it. We were very disappointed in the qualilty of this product and would not recommend it."
2,Pricey Play Toy,"Luckily (for me) my mom bought this expensive toy for my son. He got it when he was around 12 months old and didn't really play with it much for the first six months. He initially was afraid of the sounds it made! He mainly tore off the arc with the ""P"" on it to use for teething. Later on he snapped the little barrier arm to the elevator in two-which created a potential choking hazard in the small round piece created when it broke. He does love the magnetic cars, though. He enjoys the sounds the garage makes now that he's 21 months old, but still doesn't really get the concept of running the cars through the car wash or sending them for a ride in the elevator. I'd say this is a toy for a three year old and up. Overall, I'm glad he's gotten some enjoyment from this toy but I'm glad I wasn't the purchaser."
5,A Winner For the Rugrat Set,Bought for two different sets of grandkids once they turned 18 months. A big hit for all. Hours of play. Inserting quarters in the elevator slot will block its operation requiring major repairs. Don't ask me how I know this.
1,"Expensive, poorly designed toy","If this worked it should be worth about 35 bucks, but it doesn't even stay assembled. My toddler loves ramp type toys but whenever he tries to play with it the ramp and tower come apart. There are no screws or snaps to hold them in place, they just ""rest."" Yeah right. You can't use it to play cars, it's just a giant poorly designed heavy puzzle to be put together by the parent over and over again."
1,FALLS APART,"With the slightest touch the toy falls apart where it is supposed to ""snap"" together. Called the company about it and they had massive attitude. Will never buy IPlay again."
4,"Good toy for toddlers, but very basic","I bought this garage for my son's first birthday. It was very easy to put together, but it is also very easy to take apart. It could have been designed a little better, so that the parts wouldn't come off the base so easily. It is fine if you don't pick it up too much. It has a volume control, so you can adjust the noise level, or even turn off all the sound effects. I am a bit disappointed with the size of the top floor of the garage. There is barely enough room to put all three cars on the top level. It is a nice toy, but I wish that I had bought the Fisher Price garage instead."
3,Good playset,"We purchased this for our son's 1st birthday in early October, and it remains a favorite several times a day. However, our little guy loves to attempt to take it all apart, which is rather easily done. All he has to do is start by removing the ""U"" shaped ""P"" sign 1/2 way down the ramp. He loves the cars, and enjoys pressing the buttons. However, he hasn't understood the entire elevator process, but nonetheless enjoys putting all 3 cars, and whatever else he can fit there inside the elevator.I think it's a bit pricey, but any toy that keeps your childs interest for over 3 months is a good toy. 3.5 stars."
1,Not a fan.,My son received this for his first birthday and I thought it was going to be something he loved but not in the slightest. It comes apart much too easy. About the only thing my son has enjoy about his toy is pushing the buttons to make noises. It's a cute idea but it needs to be better built in my opinion. I would not and am glad I did not spend the money on this.
4,Great toy!,Wonderful toy for toddlers who love vehicles! My son loves that the cars are magnetic and the sounds are fun (not absurdly loud/obnoxious). I gave it four out of five stars simply because it is a little pricey for a toy.
2,Sister Act Karaoke,This product did not meet my expectations. I needed it for a retirement celebration and my colleagues and I wanted to sing our own words in French on the original instrumental I will follow him.The reason I bought it is the Product Description that said: Sing the classic songs from the movie musical Sister Act. The CD includes full lyric book (no books was included) and 2 versions of the songs: one with guide vocals and ONE INSTRUMENTAL ONLY. This is not true. We still hear backvocals In English. So I cannot use it.
3,Philadelphia Experiment II,"This movie did NOT star Michael Pare. The movie was O.K. The first time I watched it...I did not get it at all! It can be very confusing. If you are a philadelphia experiment/Montauk project buff and have read a lot of books on this subject, you will enjoy it. It has a lot of what if's having to do with time travel. I plan on buying it. The first P/X was the best of the two movies."
2,A Bland Experiment,"The Philadelphia Experiment should have never had a sequel, but, alas, here it is. The plot is muddy, characters bland, and the action marginal. Many plot complications are left unresolved throughout the film, and the careful viewer may have difficulty seeing connections between the plot. The film is by all means a bad clone of Orson Welles ""1984"" and is best described in one word: mediocre."
1,This movie is awful!,"The Philadelphia Experiment 1 is good, but the second part is awfull. The first movie is coherent with the supposition of experiment really happened, but the second is only bad science fiction. Well, we don't know if the Philadelphia Experiment really happened, but the second movie makes clear movie is sci-fi."
5,the Philadelphia Experiment 2,always loved it but only saw it once. Now i can enjoy it. In fact I had never seen all of the movie only pieces of it.
2,"bad, bad movie","Slow moving, nonsensical follow up to the original, which was at best just okay. Bad acting, insipid pacing, sloppy direction, and an incomprehensible script however sink this lame follow-up."
3,Positive,I have always liked this movie. I do wonder what the outcome would have been if the same actor had done this one as in the first.
5,Harrison,"A great movie about a man named David Herdeg who is the only one whose DNA enables to leap through time. Another man, Mailer,runs time military experiments during the duration and second larger experiment that forces Herdeg through to a time when a stealth fighter plane is forced through time changing the whole space time continuum in earth's history in second world war when the Nazi wins the war. Now, David Herdeg must go back from 1993 in time to 1943 save the world by tempting Mailer to leap back in time so Herdeg change the course of history and save the United States from the Nazi military bond invasion by destroying the phoenix stop the recreation of another horrible future."
2,sequel not as good as the original (2.5/5),"this movie doesn't live up to the standards of the first one(which wasnot spectacular,but decent enough).a combination of dog awful actingand dog awful throwaway lines,and a sometimes slow as molasses pacemake this one hard to watch at times.plus,you you get to see verylittle of the actual time travel aspect during the movie.it's basicallyjust a drama,with a maybe a minute or two in total focused on the timetravel aspect.i did however like the ending.i found it very touchingand unexpected.it actually redeems the movie a little bit,in myopinion.for me,The Philadelphia Experiment is a 2.5/5"
1,The Philadelphia Experiment 2,"OK: I loved the first movie, so when I heard that a sequel had been made, I decided to track it down. I was never able to find it in a video store, so I ordered it on-line. I had high expectations, and even if the movie wasn't quite as good as the first, I would have been happy. I love Sci-Fi, and especially well thought out stories and movie production. THIS MOVIE STUNK. The story was full of technical holes, the acting was overdone, the villan scenes/alternate history scenes were nonsense and there weren't even any good special effects. I feel sorry for the actors who were in this dog. If anyone would like my tape, you can have it for free. (But many thanks to Amazon.com for helping me find it.) My curiosity has been satisfied (and disappointed!)."
1,Garbage,"Nothing even remotley like the first move, this movie protrays a future dystopia in which the premise that the first movie was based on (the U.S. Navy's ""Project Rainbow"" to make use of time travel and invisibility) in order for a man to go back in time and change the course of history. most of the movie is just senseless violence and dumb attempts to fill up two hours with due to the lack of any interesting characters or any real plot."
1,Lousy Film,"Don't waste your money on this film, the first one was alot better than this, I recommend that one."
4,wonderful ticket for time travellers.,"ready for some audio time-travel? chicago 1924-28, sound good? well, here's your ticket. this is a fantastic collection of jazz recordings from that place and that era. the sound quality is excellent - bright and clean, and the performances are lively with a spirit of their times. i wasn't born until 1961, but this music makes me nostalgic for the 20's. fine stuff, indeed."
4,Talking Watch Pleases User,"The person that the watch was ordered for is almost blind and needs to hear the time. So when her previous one gave out, we searched for one and found this one on this website. She is very pleased with it so far and it looks good on her wrist. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good talking watch."
2,Too micro to stay up,"Maybe it's my shoes, but these socks don't seem to have enough around the ankle to stay up through any level of activity. I can't tell if the extra bit around the back of the sock is helping or hurting, but at least it gives me something to grab on to while pulling up the socks. Otherwise, I like the material and thickness."
2,Silent Joe---Yawn,"Well, what can I say? I had such high hopes for this book, the reviews were so favorable and the book won an Edgar Award so I thought it would be a superior story. Not! I had to force myself to finish it, found the story line lame, the action not credible. Joe, face scarred so badly that he frightens people, but the ladies were mysteriously attracted to him? His sexcapades were amazing. There was no mystery involved here, no surprises. I found the multitude of spelling, grammatical and punctuation errors very distracting; I plan to volunteer to proofread books for Kindle!"
4,Silent Joe is a Treat!,Intriguing and unusual plot...many subplots. A good relaxing read. I enjoyed the characters and look forward to reading more of Parker 's novels.
5,I loved this book!,"I didn't want this book to end. I have reread it already and hope Joe Trona becomes a fixture in future books. I think there are a lot of possibilities for this character and the girl he loves. If Mr. Parker uses this character again I hope he gives the kid some happiness, as he deserves it."
3,Review of Silent Joe,Slow start but kept my interest as it progressed.Last stopped read I Nguyen it but am glad I finished
3,"TOO, TOO, TOO MANY TYPOS","I am a HUGE fan of Parker's but the typos drove me crazy. The book itself was brilliant, as are most of Mr. Parker's works, but the incredible number of typos really distracted from the body of work. I give TJP a solid 5 stars for the book but a -1 for the proofing."
4,Bittersweet story of love and loyalty,"Silent Joe develops the flawed and unlikely hero that T. Jefferson Parker features in all his novels. This time, however, the character is not as easy to relate to as his other central characters. Joe does not feel as well-rounded, I think in part because the writing is more terse than in Parker's previous works. A few more words could have softened Joe into someone we can all identify with and learn from. This is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.Parker delivers all of his good stuff in this book: fast pace, shifting values, people who are not what they seem, and satisfying resolution of pressing questions. The ending was more predictable than some of his others, but I wouldn't have it end any other way, so it is forgivable.All of his other works have been enjoyable. Parker writes books that are both intellectually and emotionally appealing to all lovers of the mystery/thriller genre."
5,FANTASTIC!,"This is one of the best Parker books I have read. He is usually good but this one is above even that. Joe Trona is a cop, assigned to a jail for his first five years then he will go somewhere else. He is also working for his adoptive father, Will Trona. His father is murdered as Joe is trying to protect him. Joe then sets out to find the killer or killers as the case may be. Joe works within the system using the police force to his advantage. He finds out many secrets and maybe, just maybe, Will was not the saint Joe thought he was. There is some action but the mystery of the book will hold your attention. You won't want to put it down. If you have never tried Parker this is a god place to start."
3,Not as advertised !,"I bought this book based on the fact that it had won the edgar awards and three quarters of the book did demonstrate why it was selected for the prize. However, what let it down was the ending. Without giving too much away, the book starts off as a whodunit where the ""hero"" of the book has to find his father's killer but the revelation left me glad that the book was only about 400 pages so that I had not wasted too much time on it.Basically the book had a good buildup and joe's characterization was nicely fleshed out, especially his relationship with his father, but the ending was a real cop-out. I kept on expecting a twist in the rationale behind the murder but I was left disappointed. Once you get past the ""novelty"" of having a physically scarred hero and the challenges in life he has to endure as a result, there is little of substance left.Easy way to pass the weekend, though!"
2,Another reason I'll never move to california,"Started off interesting with fast-paced writing, then began to get repetitive. Joe had very little personality and the ease at which hot babes became attracted to him was totally unrealistic. In real life, hot chicks stay away from men with badly burned faces. Another annoyance was how every single women character introduced was ""attractive"". Every one. It's possible this was intentional on Parker's part, maybe everyone DOES appear attractive to Joe when he compares them to himself, but it annoyed me anyway. Also annoying was the ""liberal"" california feel of the book: white rich men bad; poor latin people good or misunderstood. Like many others, I'm tired of liberalism. Yaaaawn.Silent Joe is enormously overrated. I was disappointed given the rave reviews."
1,MULTIPLE GRAMMATICAL ERRORS IN BOOK,"This book has MULTIPLE errors in spelling, grammar, and even several places where a completely wrong word is inserted. All the T. Jefferson Parker books I've read are this way. The stories are great but there obviously is not proof reading involved.This had to have been the worst grammatical offender of the all of T. Jefferson Parkers' books. Really takes away from the enjoyment of the story."
3,The Other Parker,"I was searching for a different kind of mystery and tried this Edgar Award Winner. Maybe, I hoped, it will be similar to Robert Parker. Well, it's not. I almost gave up on it. The problem is that the hero is basically unlikeable. He's a ""just the facts, Ma'am"" kind of cop, who is incapable of spontaneity. Every comment and action is calculated. He has no sense of humor and no tolerance for ambiguity.Towards the end, I had to admire the author for structuring his plot so well. He did a good job of linking the disparate strands in the final pages. But please, silence Joe forever."
2,Too Many Words for So Little Substance,"This really won an Edgar? Seriously? I can only assume it was a really down year for the Mystery genre.The central character in this book, Joe, is painfully boring. Painfully, excruciatingly boring. And yet, Parker feels the need to expound on and on and on about every tiny little detail of Joe's entire life. Parker gives us boundless information about Joe, none - well, almost none - of which is relevant to the plot.Midway through the book, if somebody had just stepped in and killed Joe, I'd have wept with joy. Nice payback for him torturing me with his boring character.If I'd checked this book out of the library, I'd never have finished it. And as it turns out, that would have been for the best, as this book had one of the worst non-ending ever."
2,Lame Joe,"What a lame thriller ! A great premise is executed with lack of style and sensibility. The protagonist - Joe Trona , has overcome a great ordeal in his early childhood just to become a killing sex machine - good for him. The plot of political and high society intrigues is O.K, but doesn't come close to noir classics, the love story is preposterous and the action scenes are unbelievable. If you really into physical and mental scarred heroes, look for Carol Starkey in Robert Crais' excellent Demolition Angel."
3,O.K. Book,"I like reading books by Parker, and the book was OK,, but whoever did the proof-reading did a terrible job! Typos and wrong words throughout the book."
3,What Happened?,"I have been a fan of T. Jefferson Parker since his first book. All of his books are real page turners. This one is slow, with characters that I didn't like. Silent Joe is too polite and predictable. Too much of the story takes place in his mind. I hope his next book is better."
1,Why did I read the entire book?,"After the first few chapters there are no unexpected plot twists and this just becomes a typical, by the numbers, boring book. I bought this book based on the good reviews and kept reading expecting an interesting revelation to pop up. Nothing. The story has a soap opera/after school special feel to it and the idea of a hero with a horribly scarred face from an acid throwing incident is as laughable throughout the book as it sounds (I assumed the author would have made this interesting instead of silly, but I guessed wrong. Shame on me.)Find another book to spend your money on. This one's not worth it."
2,It just didn't grab me the way I expected,"I actually read this novel about four years ago and didn't really like it, but after reading all the rave reviews on this site I decided to give it another try. I came away feeling exactly the same way as before, let down. The plot never really grabbed me like I thought it would. Also, I never really cared for the character of Joe. Emotionally and physically scared by an abusive father, Joe grows attached to his foster family, and even becomes his adopted father Will's personal driver. When Will is murdered Joe decides to uncover the mystery behind his death on his own. Sounds like it could be interesting huh? Well, seems like most of you have but I just coulded get into this one. When it was over I was relieved, and that's not a good feeling. Sorry, maybe the third time will be a charm, but I don't see myself reading this again just to come away with the same opinion."
1,Didn't live up to reviews,"I was very disappointed with this book and shocked that it was an Edgar Award winner. From the reviews I expected a first rate mystery but I could never really get on board with ""Joe."" I found the narrator's (joe) voice stilted and awkward, his train of thought difficult to follow. The scenes were choppy and disconnected. It wasn't until page 133 that I was even marginally interested in the plot. The plot line was unique and compelling but Joe was not. I never connected with the characters (translated: I didn't care.) I was constantly annoyed by the cadence and lyric and didn't really enjoy one moment of the book. ... I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,An interesting exercise,"You have to give Parker points for taking risks. I'm sure I've never read a myster with a hero/narrator quite like this one. Isolated from the rest of humanity by a gruesome childhood disfigurement, Silent Joe is just the kind of person you expect to grow up to be pushed out to the margins of society, and grow up to be an angry, selfish monster. But he lucks out because of internal assets (eidetic memory, extreme strength of will) and of his loving, wealthy adoptive parents. The end result is not quite believable, almost like a comic book superhero."
4,thin and sleek,great watch! I have had mine for several years. very elegant and very lightweight. The only issue I had with the watch is that the black mesh wears off over time. Eventually the whole band turns a metallic gray/black. I recently lost mine after several years of trouble free use and plan on buying a new one even with the worn band.....
4,Great Slim Watch,"I tried to get in touch with Skagen to get the actual grade of the watch, but even after 6 months, no answer. Titanium is strong but its alloy is greater (Aircraft Grade, of commercial grade is used in many cases for an almost scratchless effect). This may be only pure titanium (like a pure gold, softer, hypoallergenic and usually preffered, but its lasting quite nicely. I have worn this watch every other day and there are no scratches on the titanium or the crystal even after banging against walls and stainless steel.The Stainless steel band obviously is not as great but i havent seen any scratches on it either. I am very happy with this watch and would recommend to anyone who doesnt want to spend too much. This watch is great quality and great design. It's shaped like a spaceship on the bottom kind of, so when its worn it looks even thinner than it actually is. I love it. Slim and elegant, perfect watch to wear to impress."
3,"Great looking watch, but band comes apart","Awesome watch...until the some of the woven metal links in the band came apart and started snagging on any cloth that came near my wrist. Not too expensive to replace the band, but still a hassle."
4,Beautiful & accurate,"I love this watch. It is thin, light weight, sleek and keeps excellent time. The only negative is the watch band. Although I love that there is no loose strap that hangs out like a leather band, I have found on occasion, that if the mesh clip on the strap gets slightly caught on something, the band latch will open causing the watch to fall. This has happened 3 times to me but fortunately I caught it before it had a chance to hit the floor. Putting the watch on by myself is almost impossible, but it does look beautiful. Just be careful with the band. I would give this watch 5 stars if it weren't for that one negative."
3,Looks cool,"Seemed a little fragile, and it was smaller than it looked so I am going to return it. Not really durable."
5,"Quality, elegant look. Very skinny!","I was looking for a watch that looks elegant, but is light weight. I was also tired of arm bands getting broken at the ends. So I was shopping at the local mall when I saw this. I fell in love with it on the spot! I knew this is what I wanted. I found out that Amazon sold it for way less. I still get a lot of complements.Now for the negative - the arm band is made out of a metallic (titanium?) mesh. I accidentally scratched my hand on a wall and broke one piece of the mesh. It is sticking out and scratches my hand every now and then. So, I went out and bought another Skagen (blue face). I use this one whenever I'm playing sports or doing some 'dirty' work. At the Bahamas I went scuba diving into the salty ocean water and took this baby down with me. For 45 minutes were submerged. I come up and have no problems with this watch. Several months later, no rust. No issues."
2,Clasp Fail,"The clasp failed on mine. I put a coat on and went to target. It disappeared somewhere, of course noone turned it in. I had trouble from day 1 with the clasp. It got lost within a week. People are right, it's so light you don't notice it, and then the clasp unfastens and its gone."
5,Eye catching watch,"Excellent watch and extremely attractive. It is practically as thin as the band, and overall sleek and sophisticated. The blue face is spectacular, particularly if you like blue. The pictures really do not do it justice. It is also very light and comfortable to wear. Really catches peoples attention; I get many compliments and inquiries as to where I bought it.The band is really easy once you figure it out, but there is a few minutes of confusion when you first get it. The watch holds up well so far, and I abuse my watches pretty well."
2,Read the fine print,"This is a very attractive watch, I've looked for a long time to find it at a good price. But when I got it, the clasp didn't work-it immediately fell open. In reading the fine print in the instructions for the watch, it states that the seals have to be replaced every two years under normal usage. I've never seen another watch in my life with this limitation. It would be interesting to hear from people who have owned the watch for 2-4 years. I sent it back, but it is too bad because I love the way it looks."
4,Very nice,"I like this watch a lot. It's very stylish. Because of the titanium case it is so lightweight you hardly feel it. That, and the fact that it's very thin. Only four stars because of the lack of a date feature and the water resistance is questionable. (I'm careful to take it off in the shower.)"
1,The crystal face cracked one week after wearing it,Was not happy that the face cracked one week after wearing it. I don't recommend buying it. Almost wonder if this was a fake!
1,Expensive watch - Cheap clasp - Terrible packaging,"This could be a very nice watch if the designer had spent as much effort in the design of the bracelet clasp as in the watch. The locking clasp is extremely difficult to use and is definitely not ""heavy duty"". Also - the packaging for this product was very poor - my watch arrived with all of the ""protective containers"" separated into multiple pieces in a box much larger than required. When I asked for another watch - the 2nd watch arrived with worse packaging than the first!"
5,10 Times,"I've already watched this about 10 times. It's a must have especially if you like either Magic or Bird. If it were an ESPN film, it would fit in the 30 for 30. HBO did themselves a service by producing this. Tieuel"
1,Just Plain Speculation at Best,"Arm-chair speculation parading as science. Dr. Socarides' ""theories"" are not falsifiable. A ""theory"" that cannot be tested is not a theory at all, just a collection of musings, or in this case, biases. Methinks the Dr. protest too much, if you want to get all psychoanalytic about it."
1,Ridiculous,"Socarides has carried a chip on his shoulder about homosexuality since his views were repudiated by the vast majority of psychologists, psychoanalysts and psychiatrists. He assumes that homosexuality is a disorder; starting from this first principle, he naturally comes up with conclusions that support his error."
1,This book was pseudo-scientific claptrap!,"This book, reflecting Socarides's political agenda of theorganisation he heads (NARTH) is telling. The book is full ofinaccurate, biased research results."
1,Heterosexism to the Extreme,"Charles W. Socarides never tells us WHY homosexuality is a bad thing. Why is it bad? What's wrong with it? He just can't answer that question. His reasons for disliking gay people, or thinking gay people are ""yucky"" make about as much sense as my distaste for certain green vegitables. Who cares if someone is gay? I couldn't care less! Why does a ""so-called"" straight man spend his entire life studying and obsessing over issues having to do with male homosexuality? Gee, I wonder. Looks like Socarides has his own closet-cleaning to worry about. Straight guys, and I mean real straight guys, don't spend their lives thinking only about gay stuff. Think about it. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what's going on here. I'll give you one adjective, the best one adjective to sum up Socarides's whole career (and life): self-loathing."
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly of the Christian Coalition","I bought this book for a class project on community organizing. Our specific organization we examined was the Christian Coalition and their organizing tactics. It was quite interesting and useful to our paper and presentation. The book is not pro or con Christian Coalition but more a statement of facts on how the work, organize and where they get their money."
5,Great slice of Las Vegas history,Steve Fischer has created a literary trip back to Vegas in its classic era... and what a strange trip it is! The Mob played by their own rules and the lore of Sin City is seldom more compellingly recalled than in this book of stories by a man who carries the town's history in his bones. Some of the tales are funny as hell while others are downright chilling. A very good book for those who want to know how Vegas used to be.
1,I would prefer to give it NO stars!,"I cannot believe the reviews on here! This book is not readable. I was given this book as a gift and tried to read it twice because the topic is interesting to me. I finally gave up. The format of the book is a mess. It's impossible to follow a story line. The cover is nice, but DO NOT JUDGE THIS BOOK BY ITS COVER."
5,Quick Read,"Quick read full of short stories about the history of Vegas. A look at what we all think Vegas was, is and should be."
2,When the mob ran Vegas,The book was difficult to put down. The writer made you feel a part of all the events as the story unfolds. Good book.
1,When the Mob Ran Vegas,"When the mob ran Vegas stinks. If you have a tiny amount of knowledge about the mob in Vegas, you are way ahead of Steve Fischer. His horrible writing style makes you wish to be the victim of a mob contract! Don't waste your money on this one."
3,"good info, odd structure","As much as I enjoyed the stories and histories, I found the organization of the stories was lacking in clarity. Stories jumped from 1930s to th 1970s then back to the 1940s without a sense of continuity. Many times, I had to look back at other chapters to get a sense of what time I was reading about. Other then that disconnect, the stories were fascinating, the tone was clearly that of someone excited about the topic, and a breezy read. For someone that grew up in post-mob Vegas, it was an eye opening look at the city just before my time...."
4,The Early Days,A very factual and interesting take on the early days of Vegas. I was dancing there at the time and the first nude showgirl (Lisa Malouf) is my dearest friend.
1,"Folklore, Not History","Reading this book is like having to endure your poker buddy's loquacious Las Vegas monologues every Thursday night in a friend's basement recreation room. That is, lots of titilating factoids interspersed with inappropriate ethnic stereotypes and slurs. An impressionable reader could easily come away from this book thinking all Italians are in the Mafia and are out to get you. The author's own apparent ethnicity is no license for this sort of cheesy, dated innuendo.And where was the editor? As mentioned elsewhere in these reviews, there is only the loosest continuity with characters being introduced and then re-introduced over and over again in subsequent chapters. Mr. Fischer plays fast and loose with the facts and the book should be read as a compilation of annecdotes rather than as a serious history."
3,IIs really a group of magazine articles,"This is a collection of articles, some are interesting, some not so interesting. It leaves many questions unanswered. Especially concernimg Virgina hilland Ben Siegel.But its a fun quick read and a must for all mafia buffs"
3,Good for Experts not for novices,"When I got this book I thought it will be an excellent book with lots of illustrations for beginners, however, it is for someone that is some what experience. The book has a with of information only if you know how it is done and this will be a review."
3,Ahsley Book of Knots is not the end all,I recently bought the Ashely book of knots because I thought it would tell me how to tie every knot on the planet. I found it a bit confusing because it did not use colors to illustrate the knot ties. It was hard to follow most of the knot patterns. Also it did not have climbing knots used by most rescue people. I found a great site that does animation and colors: http://www.animatedknots.com/doublefishermansrescue/index.php . Perhaps if the book came with a DVD it would be better. I know it is an old book...but come on...we have new technology now!
2,The Knot book,"This book would be good if you are a sailor, and already have knowledge of knot tying. I am a first timer who wanted to learn. Unfortionly I am 71 years old and this book does show me step by step. I requested a refund or credit back to my credit card but was refused by seller."
4,excellent book,"as reference books go, this is one of the best for knots. any knot imaginable is here and a clear concise way to tie it. great book for any purpose."
5,A Great Archive of Knot Construction and Usage,"This book is an excellent resource for knot tying and also explaining, as the knot number or the page number can be used to identify a knot anyplace in the world, regardless of the local name. I have found it to be very useful on the many overseas cruises I have made. I would recommend it to anybody who has a need or interest in knot tying. It is a household (forecastlehold?) name for serious mariners."
4,Lots of Knots,If you are into knots this book is for you. It gives a clear explanation of over 1300 knots to tie.
4,Above all other knot books...in weight only.,"I gave this book a 4 for just one reason, a lack of detailed drawings. Although it is the most extensive book of knots known to man. A must for any extreme mariner or avid boatswain mate."
2,Great as a reference,"If you are looking for a book with a ton of knots, what are they used for, and their names, this is for you. But if you are looking to learn how actually to tie some knots better look somewhere. I can difficulty count more than 15 knots that you can actually manage to decifrate how to do them. It's not that is difficult to understand, its just that it doesn't explains at all.Remember, as a reference book is excellent. But is not a guide for making knots (in the cover it says so, but trust me it isn't)."
5,Ashley Book of Knots,I was very pleased with the quickness of the shippment and the quality of the product.
4,Complete Book of Knots,This book has every knot that you can imagine. The descriptions are good. It is still going to be easier to go on line and see an animated knot but every sailor should own this book.
4,THE most expensive BOOK I ever bought,This is the most expensive single book I have ever purchased BUT it is worth it if you ever wondered about how to tie something.This books does a good job of explaining how to tie and uses for knots. A very handy addition to have
5,"Great book, Great desserts","What a wonderful book! Now I can eat great tasting desserts without feeling guilty! Karen's recipes are very tasty, directions presented clearly and I like the fact that she has included nutritional information for each dessert. If you have a sweet tooth but want a healthy dessert, this book is for you."
2,"Sigma Apoteleconverter 1,4X for Pentax",The autofocus of some pentax lens (300mm F 4.5 star for example) does not work properly; the same happens with the exposure time.My suggestion is: test it with your camera and lens before to buy it.Bliss
3,Surprise with Sigma teleconverter,"I bought the Sigma APO teleconverter 1.4 (Nikon mounting)via Amazone. I like Amazone, but the converter was a surprise to me. It didn't work at all with the Nikon 18-200mm. Bad surprise. It works very well with the Sigma 150mm macro 2.8. Good surprise, as I expected. It works with the Sigma 150-500mm, but with losing autofocus, so not very usefull. It works, but very slow, with the Sigma 120-300mm 2.8. Be aware: good information about teleconverters and their possibilities is hardly available."
2,Not very good,This teleconverter is alright. You really have to stop down in order to get a half decent photo. The extra reach is nice but the picture quality is not very good at all.
2,Only compatible with Sigma lenses no matter what they tell you!,Look very closely at the product specs before purchasing. They give you a very specific list of lenses it will fit.
1,incompatible,this is only compatible with select Sigma APO Lenses. Most other lenses won't even fit on it.
1,Not suitable for action photography,"I have to say I was very disappointed in this. I tried two of them. I really wanted this to work. I expected some drop off in image quality with my Sigma 70-200 f2.8 lens. But complete still shots, it does a suitable job. But for action, and I primarily shoot college football, it was a failure.I tried two copies and on both, over 80% of my shots were trashed upon first viewing. I had high hopes for this, but no luck!"
2,Slows auto focus,The extend reach is not worth the loss of auto focus speed. I lost many action shots due to out of focus pictures. Probably better if you aren't doing sports
5,Teleconverter by Sigma,My converter did not fit. I did not return itI will purchase another lens someday so I am ok with it. The package came on time an it was in great condition. Please post if possible the Sigma lens that will fit this converter.
1,Sigma APO Teleconverter 1.4x EX DG for Canon Digital SLR Cameras,"I did a lot of research on this item before I bought it. Nowhere did I read a bad review or rating and most buyers raved about how their pics remained sharp as a tack with the Sigma 120-300 mm f2.8 lens, but this is not what I experienced. All my pics are now slightly out-of-focus when I use this lens so I no longer use it and mark it off as a bad purchase."
5,Great!,"I wanted a large pastry scraper to help me carry food from my cutting board to the stove-top. That is why I bought this; it has a very large surface area (compared to most other models), and the handle is curved, to give even more space to transfer food. If you want a pastry scraper for dough purposes, I might recommend looking at other models, but I think this model would work just fine too.The stock picture they provided is useless; see the customer images. I added two pictures of the scraper in action. = )"
3,Design works but pitted & rusted 1st time in dishwasher,"I agree with the positive reviews but wanted to add that this item should be washed by hand. First time in dishwasher and the item is degrading, pitting and rusting at curve on both sides. Too bad, otherwise it's a nice product."
5,"Chef Scoop/Pizza Rocker, Brushed Stainless Steel","I purchased this item at the same time as a pizza stone. Haven't made a pizza yet, but I just love this as a scoop."
2,This is NOT a pizza rocker,This has a flat edge to it with measurements (like a ruler) and is in no way shape or form a pizza rocker. The edge isn't tapered at all so not easy to slide things on it etc...
5,Every American Should Read This Book!,Book is great for All Americans to read. Especially Christians. It brings to light all the struggles between the Catholic and Protestants through the ages. Points out how both sides used religion to exploit the Native Americans. Easy to read for a 100+ year old book!
1,More Left Wing Fundamentalist Rhetoric,"This only gets one star because there was no 0 star category. Mostly tripe from a severe Left Winger who starts sentences with, ""According to the UN..."" That alone should warn most readers that what is to follow is all one sided. Frankly I agree with Jon Stewart about Iraq and our embargo supposedly creating starvation, ""Saddam makes a bazillion dollars from oil, let him buy sandwiches."""
3,"Lots of interesting information, but dispersed","I appreciated the author's efforts to go to Indonesia, Iraq etc. to observe events in its place. The book is very good in terms of journalism. The writing, however, is a bit dry. Time to time I felt like drowning in a sea of hard-to-digest facts. I would expect more reasoning and a thorough analysis about why and how the things evolved in the way they are. I also would have liked to see more of opposing point of views. It is certainly an interesting read, though."
2,Its all our fault!!!!,"This book is not about who controls the world, or its ""new rulers."" This is a typical liberal guilt-inducing account of a couple of situations around the world. Pilger spends a great deal of time discussing the suffering of Iraqi children due to the sanctions imposed on that State. Another chapter is spent talking about the plight of Aboriginal Australians. This book is aimed to preach to the converted, and if you want to see how bad America and other Western States are pick this up. Its written in a journalistic format, and reads very fast. I did not get much out of this book and sold it right away.."
1,Where to start...,"There were some interesting facts presented along with some equally horrendous misinformation. I just can't get into someone who writes about the atrocities of one group without discussing the equally deplorable behavior of the other side. I find it disappointing that no one ever manages to write something that is completely objective. Just the facts please! I think I can make up my own mind from there on. In the end, some interesting facts, and some leaps in logic that might give you a laugh or two."
4,Cute Shoe,"This is a cute shoe and I get many compliments when I wear them. However, the leather is stiff and can be uncomfortable on certain points of my foot. The footbed is great, but the stiff upper material hurts at times."
2,Not my son's favorite,"My son is 3, and we have two different sets of trains. The classic wooden one, and this one. The one that he is always pulling out and playing with is the wooden one. I'm not sure why, I understand every kid is different, but we actually bought the geotrax set a few years back, and have since bought a couple of extensions to go with it, and we originally bought it for our daughter the first year it came out I believe. We dropped over $100 for the basic set, and about 15-20 per each extension. She's barely touched it. The prices have dropped since then, but it still makes me a little upset how much we spent on it, and how little it's been used. The geo trax set is set to go in the garage sale pile this year, and we'll use the money to invest in some more parts for the wooden set which our son dearly loves (which btw are much more cheaper and don't need batteries!!)"
5,Best Investment Ever!!,THIS IS A MUST-HAVE TOY!! I purchased the GeoTrax Railway System for my son when he was 2. He is now almost 4 and he and his 2 yr-old sister play with their GeoTrax train EVERY SINGLE DAY! They love to put the track together in different ways and use the remotes to run the trains. The entire system is incredibly durable. This has been the best investment in a toy I've ever made! We have certainly gotten our money's worth!! (Our poor expensive Thomas train gets negelected next to our GeoTrax!) I recommended GeoTrax to several friends and co-workers and every one of them has been thrilled with it. A MUST-HAVE for young boys AND girls!!
3,my review,"We had a smaller Geo Trax trail a couple years ago, and we loved it. Over time the pieces began to disappear, so I bought this one for my 3 year old for Christmas. It's easy to assemble. There is one spot on the track the the train just will not go over. It doesn't matter what pieces I use in that spot, the train just gets stuck. So maybe one of the pieces of track isn't the right size, and that's causing the entire track to rest in a way in which it isn't straight. Also, every time the train goes over the bridge, it goes too fast on the way down and falls off the track. I think I'm going to buy a different track for his birthday."
4,awesome train set,"My just turned 2 year old received this as a Christmas gift and already in two days can manuver the remote control. That in my opinion is enough to give this an awesome rating, finally something he can do by himself!!! My husband is upset with how slow the train goes, but I think its fine, and he said the accessories don't load the train worth a darn, I haven't tried that yet. But its really cute and easy to use. I will let you know about the durability later on as I have in home daycare kids that will play with this all day!!!"
5,Great Train to keep for years to come,"This is a great gift with lots of options to ad to. Its a little addicting even for the parents! Very Durable and its nice you have the option for battery or non-battery play. One thing I love is you can customize your little city with different piece that can suit your childs room. (example nautical, construction, planes, rescue/emergency, mountains, so on) What a fun way to play with your kids!"
5,Great Train Set,"This is a great train set. I have two boys 2 1/2 and 15 months, My oldest has played with the trains almost everyday, it's easy for him to start and stop and he can re-connect the track when his younger brother has taken it apart. The youngest doesn't take it apart as much as does the wooden set because it stays together really well. They both enjoy the train set and worth the money."
5,This is the language of the heart,Rarely do we have such a despairing story told with such eloquence. Kotlowitz deserves praise for his ability to give so generously of himself with language. The life of the Rivers' family continues to haunt me these many years since I first read about them. This is a sustained labor of love.
5,Great Reading,I was required to read this book for a class and loved it! The story of these boys was so moving. I would recommend this book to everyone!
4,There are no nonsense talks here!,"I had to read this book as a part of my college course, but boy! What a book it turned out to be!The descriptions that the author creates are vivid and the story is touching. Undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read."
2,Sorry to bring the average down...,"While I think it is very important to expose the evils of american poverty, I was not impressed with this attempt. It seemed as if Kotlowitz was wavering between a novel and a journalistic expose, and the book goes on much longer than it should. He piles on detail after detail of their horific situation until you are desensitized. There is no real reason to drag the book out for as long as he does since there is never any conclusion to the situation. Overall I just did not find this book to be enjoyable, inspirational, or particularly well written."
2,The Truth is boring,"Alex Kotlowitz could have written a book about anyone in the United States and it would have been the same story. The book was uneventful, but it does show the inside track to the ghettos in Chicago. Character development was handed to the reader on a silver platter. It was a 9th grade level book. However, Kotlowitz did show courage and originality in his untainted description of the lives of the two young boys. I commend him for his adventures, but it just wasn't extremely exciting or outrageous."
5,I wanted to care for the entire family,"This book takes on a 'true approach' to living in poverty, especially for blacks to live in poverty. I'm a social work undergrad college student, and until I read this book, I was'nt aware of exactly how it was in poverty. Alex writings in the book, made me feel as though I was living with the Rivers and feeling their emotions. Thank you Alex for writing this excellent book. I encourage all college students to read the book, especially social work students. It really made me understand how blessed I am. Now I'm trying to see how I can get a copy of the movie, Oprah Winfrey played the mother. I didn't even know there was a movie for it. Can't wait to see it!"
5,Book Review,"An email I read initially brought my attention to this book and I thought I would try it. The title initially grapped at me; 'There Are No Children Here'Growing up in a small rural community and currently living in a comfortable suburb is far from what these children grew up in. Knowing this is reality for many children just saddens my heart and for whatever reason, many choose to ignore or believe their life situations truly exist.I wanted to scream; this is not fair! No one should be treated the way they were. God put us on this earth as his companions; each equal in his sight!It must hurt him greatly how we sometimes treat each other.A true eye-opener and recommended book for all."
5,This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.,I just want to congradulate Mr. Kotlowitz on the great job he did with this book. I came across it through a school project I had to write. It really made me think about how lucky and blessed some people really are. You never know how good you have it until you see how bad others have it. My heart really went out to these boys. But the sad thing is that their are so many Pharoahs and Lafeyettes out here in the world. The author did a great job showing us the lives of those who unfornately are less fortunate. Thank you for opening my eyes.
5,One heck of an insiteful book!,"Back when I went to school, we practiced ""Duck and Cover"" drills incase of nuclear war. We also had tornado drills, where we huddled in hallways. Today's kids, in the inner city, learn the above, but instead of nuclear holocaust or violent tornadoes, they are escaping gunfire and gange violence. Having lived in Chicago 20 years, I know all too well what these places are like. Warehousing the poor, that's what it's all about."
1,Absolute Left-Wing Propaganda,"Well one of the reasons ""there are no children here"" is that there are no fathers here. This book is explotative in both the children written about and the role of fathers in general. Barely mentioned, the role of the father is fully dismissed. Rather, society and lack of government intervention is blamed for all the problems of these two young boys. There is no emphasis on personal responsibility nor is there an effort to offer alternative solutions for resolving the plight of similar youths. In short, this is a maudlin, contrived attempt to emotionally manipulate the weak minded individual and duping them into believing that only gov. programs could possibly help."
1,There Are No Children Here...Wonder Why?,This book was incredibly boring. I couldn't stay awake while reading. The only people who would want to read this book would be people who live in the Ghetto of Chicago. The book had little action or suspence and the boys were not incredibly interesting. Kotlowitz did do a fair job of reporting and I give him credit. It takes a lot of guts to dodge bullets just to follow a 12 year old kid around. Read this book only if you want to know about the problems Chicago has in the projects
1,This book is boring,"This book is the most uneventful story that I've ever read. The only person who would want to read this book would be the family of the characters or author. Anyone who is even remotely distracted when reading a book that's not ""grabbing"" should by no means at all read this book. I must have picked up and put this thing down about 2000 times, and had to reread sections because of my wandering mind."
5,In reaction to the people who gave 1 star.,"I was truly disturbed to read the comments of the readers who disliked this book. I honestly believe that you are either ignorant on the matter of poverty and drugs in America or that you just don't have a heart. I appologize for making such ""ad hoc"" statements, but its very disappointing to see someone casually blame the victims in this situation when they don't have any of the facts. To call people in the projects ""lazy"" and ignorant is not only a terrible stereotype, but also completely wrong. If you would like to see where i'm coming from, either come stay with me in my appartment in North Philly, or read ""The Corner"" by David Simon and Edward Burns."
5,Excellent Book Review,"Can you imagine living in the projects in Chicago? Well for Pharaoh and Lafayette it isn't a dream. They wake up every morning knowing that there might be shooting or a gang fights. They live in what used to be one of the nicest areas in Chicago, but not anymore. Now it is one of the worst areas in Chicago. Families are afraid to go outside during the night because a bullet might accidentally hit them.Alex Kolwitz is an excellent writer. He goes into great detail explaining how difficult it is living in the projects. That if you live in these areas you grow up extremely fast because of all the violence that goes on everyday. If you have never experienced living or even gone there then the book would be very interesting to you..."
5,Startling Revelation into Inter-City Poverty and Hope,"I have read and re-read this book about 10 time in about 15 years. The trials these boys and their families face is so increcibly real -- so heartbreaking. Reading this book makes me want to find these children, bring them into my home, and nurture them into the realization that life actually has beautiful, wonderful things to bring to children. I have recommended this book to so many people, I've lost track. I have six (6) new copies in my personal library, and whenever I hear of anyone who is going through a rough time, I send them this book. Thank you, Alex Kotlowitz, from the bottom of my heart. Nothing that I've ever read has meant so much to me."
3,Character Development,"Interesting view of another side of America that those of us who live in suburbs do not fully understand. I wanted more character development about the two boys. There were too many brief digressions of others who were not well developed in the book (e.g., Weasel, Ricky, etc.)"
5,best book i've ever read,shocking look into the lives of inner city children. this should be required reading for everyone in America. unbelievably good!
5,Very Descriptive!,"Kotlowitz writes so dramatic in telling us how the other half of the world lives! The story of how the two boys:Lafayette and Pharoah grow up is so detailed and so touching. How everyday something bad happens, or someone gets killed. A very true realization on how people attend a funeral more likely than they attend a wedding out there. I definately recommend adults as well as children to read this story. It gives you a real feeling for the unfortunate neighborhood."
1,Waste of Money.,"I was very disappointed by this book. It tells you that you ""should"" or ""shouldn't"" do things, but doesn't tell you how.My orphan was 5 days old when I found him. He does not remember his mother or siblings. As a result, he lacks social skills. I purchased this book to find out how to compensate because it has become a problem. The book says that socialization is a problem.Well a big fat ""duh!""The authors may have chosen great photos, but their exertise with orphan kittens leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Surprised!,"I have read alot of these books (well, high not university) but I thought that it was ridiculous how that an EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD was contemplating having you-know-what with her boyfriend, and this was the RESPONSIBLE TWIN? Sorry, but I hated that part."
5,Lt Pruett vs Private Jessica,"When Private Jessica has had enough of Vanessa Pruett's bullying.she wants a boxing match,She wins it.Vanessa throws Jessica and her new friends out of Flordia Security Camp,or whatever it's called. Elizabeth's star actors have quit,and it seems that the play might be over before the curtain is raised. I think something about Jessica in jail,and one of her friends friends from the boot camp arrests her or something."
4,Don't Tell everything that Happens!,hi i would like to say that one person before wrote bout jessica coming i haven't read the book yet so it ruins it for me i may still get the book but next time please don't ruin it for others
1,pathetic.,"i seriously think this is the worst book i have ever read.i also think jessica is a low-down, evil, cowardly little pig-headed dumb blonde.she put someone elses life in danger to save her own (...) butt.this has really turned me off from all other sweet valley books.it isnt worth it at all.i cannot beleive i wasted my good money on this."
4,A VERY Good movie!,"I have never seen the original, but from what I have read it does not compare to this one. Kim and Jennifer are HOT!!! in this movie...especially Kim. This is when Kim was very good looking and the scene of her with her clothes off was worth the price of the DVD. I own this movie and must have watched it about 5 times or more and I never get tired of it. I gave it 4 stars cause I think they should have shown more shots of Jennifer naked. In my opinion this is the one that should be on HD...not the original one."
4,Don't Let This One Get Away (hehehe)...,"Okay, the plot is a little thin, the bad guys are a tad on the black and white side, and the believability rating is somwhere between Star Wars and Fantasia, but you have to love any movie that Kim Basinger [reveals all], and anyone who just enjoys a good shoot-'em-up... will get a charge out of this one. Leave your intellect at the door and enter one helluva thrill ride.. definitely an ""E"" ticket attraction and well worth the price of admission. Anyone looking for The Lion in Winter will undoubtedly be disappointed and anyone watching with the eyes of your average critic will find so much to write a bad revue about there could be a book in the works. But, remember this.. Kim Basinger is... in this movie. Thank God for Hollywood."
2,Why on earth did they do this?,"What a crazy piece of work this is. I do not mind remakes so much, but really this is too much. Whole scenes have been copied directly from the original Peckinpah movie and nowhere is there any improvement. On the contrary! Basinger is not to bad, but I liked Ali McGraw better in the part. Steve McQueen was a hundred times better than Alec Baldwin, Donaldson is no Peckinpah and through it all I missed Quincy Jones' excellent score. The story is practically the same, but without the taut suspence of the original. Michael Madson and Jennifer Tilly steal the show and while they do a good job, they are not supposed to carry the movie. Now you start thinking them the interesting part and the bit about the McCoys running to Mexico with all gangland USA on their tale becomes an anoying sideline. Don't bother to watch this one. It is nothing better than any other action movie. Stick with the original!"
1,Sanitised Version of the Remake,"Don't buy this!The packaging on the box claims this is ' unrated' - IT ISN'T!ALL the sex scenes are missing - how the studio involved can get away with the lie on the packaging is a mystery to me, but they have!Worthless sanitised US version, NOT the print that was released in Europe.AVOID!!"
3,the getaway,"The tape is in poor condition, the picture jump for about 5-10 min. at the begainning than it right itself,but its a good movie and other than that its ok. I stiil would buy again from them."
2,"An absurd, unsurprising actioner that rips off the original","Don't see this one if you've seen the original for two reasons. One, it is a near scene-for-scene reworking of the 1972 film and two, it's simply a bad movie. The only difference I noticed was that there was heated sexuality in this which only makes it crude and unpleasant (I don't remember the first one having as many--if any at all--suggestive scenes). Baldwin is acceptable in the lead but has nowhere near as much effortless charm or verve as Steve McQueen. Basinger is awful and makes Ali MacGraw (a rather untalented actress) look like Bette Davis. Skip it."
4,????????????????,Why on earth is the only version of this film available on DVD the Rated version? Isn't getting uncut/unrated versions of movies a staple of the DVD format?
2,Why remake a bad film in the first place?,"The Getaway is based on the 1972 action thriller from director Sam Peckinpah. This remake is fairly better because of James Woods, who is a major improvement over whoever played the Jack Benyon character in the original.The Getaway is really just a teched-up version of the original, with added sex/nudity, a lot more bloodletting and shootings, and more profanity. In the long run, it's a pretty bad movie but it rarely moves at a slow clip as the original did for just about its entire running time. Alec Baldwin is really not bad as Doc Mccoy. As for Kim Basinger, I know she won an Oscar but is she really a great actress? Compare her one Oscar award and nomination to 4 Razzie nominations (she's almost sure to get another with her performance in Bless the Child). She's not particularly good in the role, at least she doesn't act like the typical damsel in distress."
1,Another Piece of Garbage from Amazon.com,"I purchased this product from Amazon.com and it will NOT load or ply in my HD-DVD Player. The advertisement clearly staed that this product would not play on either a standard DVD Player or a Blue Ray Player, however it would play on ANY HD-DVD Player. I have a very expensive Samsung HD-DVD Player and this movie will not load or play. I'm starting to question what kind of compant Amazon.com is? I am a new member and have recently purchased 3 different products from Amazon.com and absolutely none of the 3 products have worked correctly. What's up with that?"
1,Format woes,"I ordered this before I realized HD format would not play on my existing DVD players. Went out and bought a new high qual Blue Ray unit, and it still won't play. Won't play on either of my computers with several different Video (HD and otherwise) programs. Too much trouble and expense to return it. It is now a pretty coaster on my computer desk."
2,Anyone who likes this better than the Pekinpah is a moron.,"All the pretty people in this film. Even the Rudy character played by Michael Madsen. This is adapted from a Jim Thompson novel for cryin' out loud! These are supposed to be marginal characters, not fashion models. Though McQueen and McGraw were attractive (but check out McQueen's crummy prison haircut) they were believable in the role. Baldwin and Bassinger seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases. Action wise, the robbery scene in the Pekinpah version was about 100 times more exciting and suspenseful than anything in this re-make."
1,Buy the original,"I can't imagine the size of Mr. and Mrs. Baldwin's ego's when they thought to remake a Steve McQueen classic. Remake a film with a good story, that was produced poorly. Not the case in the original. This remake is 2 hours of the actors mugging for the camera, it's unwatchable."
4,WONDERFUL EVEN WITHOUT THE IGGEDIES,"i like it because it is good, raw hip hop. this is the type of hip hop in which i grab my headphones and just chill. like one reviewer said, this is for hip hop headz, TRUE HIP HOP HEADZ, only. IF ONLY there post HOLD IT DOWN stuff would've sounded like this........along with DEAD SERIOUS."
3,Not identifiable as Weill,"An interesting ""unknown"" piece, but the dissonance expected in a Weill piece (Three Penny Opera, Mahagonny) is striking by its absence. Part of the Milken Archive of music by American Jewish composers, the recording is well-performed, featuring highlights of the opera, under direction of Gerard Schwarz and soloists mostly not familiar to this listener."
2,Watch,"I loved the watch when I first received it. I wore it two or three times, then a piece of the wire mess that the band is made of broke and was sticking up. I tried to bend it around but the loose wire continued to snag my clothes so I stopped wearing it."
4,Good watch,"Looks nice, and it was easy to adjust the band to my small wrist. Weight is low. The knob is so small that's it a bit hard to change the time. I like the look of the Skagen watches and my husband has been very happy with one I gave him a year ago. I wish they had more models with second hands, which I need for work."
2,"Beautiful Watch, but the band is already ruined - Not the seller's fault of course.","I love this watch, but the band snagged on my pants and is already ruined within two weeks of receiving it. :("
3,Prompt service but not super happy with product,I have been using this watch for less than a month and there are already scratches on the dial. I used this watch just while going out and no rough use. Surprised by the quality as I thought skagen was high quality stuff.
5,Love this watch,"I have a tiny wrist and have been searching for a watch that fit it for years. Finally find a gorgeous watch that fits. Great price, love the style."
3,nice watch with not so great package,"I like this watch a lot. It really looks very nice, but the shipping package does not look so great. The plastic box of this watch has a cracked line on it. The outside card board box is not packed with tissue paper and looks as if the box had been re-used for many times."
4,Skagen ladies watch 107SSSBD,"Saw this watch at a cdn.retail store purchase price would have been $141 taxes in. Enter Amazon.com not quite $70 all in and only had to wait one week from time of order to delivery. Love the watch, looks very stylish, the watch band is so easy to adjust. Would buy watches by Skagen anytime."
4,Great Style but...,"The style of this watch is hard to beat. I have owned this for almost two years and it functions perfectly. The wrist band is very flat and the black face color with the silver band is a great combination. I have a small wrist and I don't like bulky watch bands because they look over powering. The smoothness of the band makes it so comfortable to wear. However, I do have a couple of complaints. When I'm out in the sun the glare on the crystal number dots and the second hand make it hard to read at a glance. I will order another Skagen watch but I won't get the crystals on the watch face. It is also very difficult for me to pull out the knob to change the time, although I only need to do that a couple of times per year."
2,"Nice looking, but unreliable","I bought this watch because I needed durable metal construction that wouldn't pinch. Plus, I loved the way it looked. However, every day I have to constantly check to make sure it is still displaying the correct time. It loses 5 minutes every 3-4 hours."
2,The best book,"I could't stop reeding, I loved reading it. The book was entertaining and imaginative, I learned a lot. I can highly recommend the book to anyone who wants a relaxing break."
2,"Pretty, but poor clasp.","It is a very pretty watch, but the clasp is poorly made and won't stay closed! It has already fallen off because of this."
4,A fun gift,I bought this and the toothbrush shaped cookie cutter as a gift for my sister who's a dental assistant. She absolutely loved them. They are cute and fun and different from your average cookie cutters.
2,No help.,"I have a big house and a wireless network. One of the computers is placed in a room that gets a weak signal. So, I purchased this antenna which seems to make no difference at all. In addition, the instructions are vague and unhelpful."
5,Great gift!,"I bought this as part of my husband's birthday gift, along with a watch box. It is beautiful! The mesh strap is different from your standard men's watch, and the blue color is a gorgeous, vivid cobalt shade that's not quite captured in the product picture. My husband also likes that it is thinner (height-wise) than his other watches and doesn't catch on his sleeves as much. You will not be disappointed with this watch!"
5,Skagen Men's Blue Face Mesh Watch,"Beautiful watch, simple and elegant, not too gaudy - for the price a geat value. Clasp has safety latch to prevent watch from falling off."
2,Wedding Game **Sad**,I would never have believed that Jane Feather wrote this book. I have enjoyed many of her novels in the past so I was very surprised how lacking this book turned out to be. It is very tough to like either of the characters and it drags along all the way through to the very end. I kept expecting something noteworthy to happen that just didn't. It was a story with possibilities that just petered out. It wasn't a horrible story just a very dull one. It didn't even seem to have the same tone of writing that Mrs. Feather has had in the past.
5,an esteemed translation,"David Ferry is one of, if not the best translators of ancient texts we have in America. His erudition and keen ear (and this is a difficult text to translate) open up the Georgics is such a way as to make them both complex and accessible at once."
4,Shocking Expose of Homophobic Community,"Countries that maintain stiff macho, anti-homosexual laws leave theirselves open to the kind of result depicted in ""O Fantasma.""A case in point was Germany, especially under Nazisim, and other homophobic countries like that of ""O Fantasma."" How sad a result: our anti-hero is so frustrated with pent-up sexual emotion that he becomes crazed with one-track attention. Going from repression and confusion to blatant animalistic activities, he embodies the consequences of a society trying to maintain its male population in particular. However, such repression affects females too in a direct way, as demonstrated in our anti-hero's physical abuse of women.A cautionary tale, ""O Fantasma"" graphically demonstrates the dire consequences of homosexual repression, particularly as backed up by laws. It's a crucial message that should be heeded by everyone. Therefore, ""O Fantasma"" becomes a highly significant and important film work."
5,male body,"For the first time in a very long time, I found a movie that's not affraid to show male frontal nudity. Most movies don't waste time showing the female body but this movie shows it all."
1,Good first 20 minutes then falls way flat.,"Saw this at the theater. First twenty minutes is exciting and the storyline seems like it would go somewhere. However, after that it's just a waste of time. I mean c'mon the guy ends up drinking leachate from a landfill and eating almost composted fruit? Something really went awry for the filmmaker."
1,How did it get financing?,"The first hour of this film is truly dull, with only a few bright spots. This is one you definitely want to watch on fast-forward unless you have an extremely high threshold for boredom. As we visit - unfortunately - every detail of a garbageman's workday existence we do have the few bright spots contributed by his reluctant object of lust that he encounters on his route.When the most excitement you get is wondering how the garbage service differs from the one offered within your own geography, you're in trouble with the film. But the lead character is so empty, and the other characters one or two dimensional at best, so everyone and everything is an oddity. And the commentary track reveals there is SUPPOSED to be a dreamlike quality to the story. But the is-this-a-fantasy element passed me by. Surreal, evidently, for those looking for it, but ultimately uneven, unrealized, dull, and boring. It's amazing this was financed at all."
1,I hated this book,"This is not a typical fairy art book. It's awful, just naked women with wings. Nothing 'magical' or even slightly appealing to fairy-realm fantasy fans. Maybe guys would enjoy it. ----Ladies/girls, look elsewhere for a book of beautiful fantasy fairy art or prepare to be disgusted & disappointed...."
2,fairy bait and switch,I bought this book thinking it was a beautiful book of fairy paintings.I was judging it strictly from the cover painting which is etheral and beautiful.Unfortunately every other portrait is a soft-core porn fairy.These images aren't even painted well.They simply appeal to low brow male fantasies.Buy a print of Beloved and skip the book.
4,Great,The String Quartet Tribute to Clay is a great CD with great music. Come on.. It can't be bad.. It is a Tribute to Clay Aiken. This CD is a great addition to any Clay Aiken fan CD collection.
1,How disappointing; Clay deserves better!,"I was thinking this was an interesting idea, a tribute to Clay. Since he sings with such emotion, and instruments have the ability to evoke powerful emotion too, I figured this cd would be very moving. What a shame it came out so...mundane! (I'm glad I listened to the clips before purchasing this sad little cd.)It started out with a rather interesting rendition of Invisible, but just goes downhill after the newness of the concept wears off. Actually, the instrumental Run to Me showed some promise again, but is followed so horribly by the unrecognizable Shine. (I really hope Clay hasn't heard Shine on this cd - it's that bad!) And I didn't think it would be possible to screw up Clay's intense I Survived You and Measure of a Man, but their versions are lackluster and downright trivial.I would've laughed by the end of this cd, but Clay deserved much better than this...it's just sad."
4,Classic-Pop crossover,"This album is perfect for people who love both Clay and classical music. The quartet is faithful to the arrangements Clay established but takes you to another world. ""No More Sad Song"" was omitted from this CD, but ""On the Wings of Love"" was an inspired addition. Though the album really is only tangentially related to Clay (the quartet has also done ""tributes"" to Led Zeppelin and Nine Inch Nails), it will make Clay fans smile."
1,ohmy goodness!,"Please dont slap clay aiken for this cd!!! I am like the biggest clay fan alive. Plus, i have been a viola player for almost cough cough 40 years. This could of been a lovely cd, but who ever did the arranging was like on speed or something, and they were so busy having the violins do some high quick melodies with some lower underscore, that it sounded tinney and out of tune. I actually have heard a lady who put together some violin and piano recordings of a few of clay's songs and they were wonderful...made you cry. This made me cry too, but for a different reason. No more sad song if you dont listen to this!"
5,This is not a review...I just have a question,"Hey Claymates!I just wanted to know what exactly this CD is. What do they mean by a ""String Quartet Tribute""? Is it a string quartet playing Clay's songs? Is it a bunch of classical musicians who were inspired by Clay to write their own songs?I want to buy this CD because I love Clay, but I would like to know what I am paying for before I order.Thanks!"
2,Too amature,"I love Clay and have watched him on American Idol several times but this string quartet sounds very amature, and are not representing Clay's music in a benificial way."
1,Sounded Interesting...BUT...,"Interesting concept, very bad execution! Puh-lease! Listen to the samples and it becomes clear that this CD lacks one really IMPORTANT thing....CLAY'S VOICE! It's his voice that makes these songs so powerful and beautiful. Not only that, but these musicians have terribly mangled the music. I think some of the instrumentals on Measure of a Man are heartbreakingly beautiful, and this doesn't ""measure up"" to them in any way, shape, or form.Are these people just trying to cash in on Clay fans?"
1,"OMG, They Must Be Kidding!","Oh.my.God. What in the world is this thing supposed to be? I love classical music, I love Clay Aiken's music, but this bears no resemblance to either. I had to keep peeking to see what song the amateurish quartet was trying to play! The depths that greed can sink to........."
5,Great Clay CD,"This String Quartet Tribute to Clay Aiken CD is a must have for any Clay Aiken fan. The music is so smoothe and it will take your breathe away. It is a great CD and will make a great addition to your collection. Plus, you have to buy it.. It's all Clay"
1,Don't throw away your money!,"ALL of you that love Clay, please don't buy this thinking it is going to help Clay. This is a shameful attempt to exploit and capitalize on Clay's popularity and name. The only people making money off of this CD are the people putting out it out. I love Clay Aiken, love his voice, love his music, and love Measure of A Man but this is NO tribute it is an insult!! I guarantee Clay would not have approved this painful attempt at music! I LOVE string music but this was unbearable to listen to, many of Clay's beautiful songs were unrecognizable in their choppy amateurish version. There needs to be a disclaimer statement by the sellers that Clay Aiken had NOTHING to do with the making of this CD and buy at your own risk!!! My regret is that I'm not permitted to give it a ""0"" stars!!"
3,Tribute to Clay Aiken,"This CD is done for Clay Aiken and the people who did this CD thought of Clay Aiken.But I don,t think they really cared about whether it was good or even if Clay would like it they just threw things together and they called it a CD.I LOVE CLAY and I would never want to see his songs screwed up like they did."
5,Best watch I have ever owned!,"I can not stand wearing watches, they make my arm itch and my skin turns green. This watch is perfect!! It is light and small and it never bothers me! I wear it for weeks at a time and it is water proof on top of everything. I have gotten several comments on it."
3,Skagen Blue face,"Very comfortable, easy to forget you have it on, adjustable band to perfection. No alarm or night light. Looks great, feels great. Nice price."
2,Nice Watch - Band is really junky.,"Very nice design and stylish. Long battery life. Band is very stylish but does have a tendency to fall apart and become sharp - and catch on shirts, etc. Band is not under warranty."
3,"Nice watch, but with a warning","I just received my watch and I'm pretty pleased... it looks nice, the band is comfortable, and the titanium makes it nice and light. However, please be advised that, contrary to the product description on this site, the manufacturer claims this watch is water resistant only to the extent of an occasional splash while washing hands... it should not be worn in the shower or while swimming.This is a loooooooonnnnnnng way from ""water resistant to 100 feet""."
5,Can't go wrong,Skagen watches are by far the most comfortable and reliable watches I have owned. A great watch for a great price.Don't worry you will glad you ordered one.
5,Nice watch,Bought this for my husband and he loves it. This is his 2nd Skagen watch and I myself have had a few over the years. Work well and very comfortable. And they look great also.
3,scratch of the surface within three months,"The surface is easily to be scratched, even though the watch is light and beautiful. Please see the image of the watch I uploaded in the customer images, there is a 1 centmeter line scratch near the center and a strange scratch at hour 4."
5,another stunner from Skagen !!!!,"A beautiful, sophisticated, sleek, subtle and very, very stylish watch. Very slim and light weight, fits the wrist beautifully.The face is a lovely iridescent, burnished blue that reflects differently in different lights.This is my third Skagen and - yes - it won't be my last.Looking much more expensive that it is, this lovely watch is a real statement of masculine maturity to be worn with pride and to complement good grooming.Very highly recommended. !!!"
3,Decent enough,"This is a beautiful watch, however the person to whom I sent it as a gift received it with a broken band. He (may dad) had to find a jewelry store to have it fixed before he could wear it. (He was too stubborn to send it back for replacement.) Once he had the band fixed, though, he loved it. If you are going to order from this company for a gift, be sure to send them item to yourself instead of directly to the receipient so you can be sure to get an undamaged item."
2,Skagen Junken,"Very nice looking, and the illusion of being slim ... but the clasp started undoing itself within a year. Replaced it with a model with leather strap, but one day the crystal just ... cracked! For no reason. Skagen is junk."
2,It's as described.,"This watch is just as described in the description and in the reviews. I ended up returning the watch the next day becasue it just wasn't my style. I have a Movado and a few Seiko's so I guess I am just used to the size and wieght of larger watches. Though in this Skagen Watch I did appreciate the ease in which you can adjust the band length yourself with only a little screwdriver. The blue face is very attractive and eye catching and the watch itself is very light. If you like larger watches with wieght and substance, I doubt you will appreciate this watch as much as someone who wants a lower profile, light-wieght watch."
2,Skagen Men's Blue Face Titanium Watch,No second hand and no date indicator are minuses. Nice look for everday watch.
2,Dead Battery,"The watch is on its way back, because it arrived with a dead battery. Bummer.That said, while this watch is extremely light and comfortable to wear (for the hour or so that I had it on), the instructions say that you can't wear it in the shower - and it's pretty small. I'd have dealt with it because it's a good looking piece, but it's noticeably smaller than any other men's watch I own.Don't miss this detail: THERE'S NO DATE ON THIS WATCH.Aside from that, you can tell this is a pretty nicely made watch...I'm just not paying to have the battery swapped on a brand new watch."
5,Elegance and simplicity,This is the best watch I ever had. The large blue face looks great. The band can be adjusted to fit any size wrist. It is light and very thin.
2,Music is ok but TISM do better lyrics,Tripe by the bagfull. Sounds are good however there is little mystery to the lyrics. TISM are far better at taking the p..s out of society and rockstar culture. The english are good at this most of the time but this one is undercooked unless you are 14. The subjects are as basic as going to the toilet in your pants.I almost believe these guys believe themselves to be worth the money and that right there eliminates the back and fowrd cool or too cool warble. Could use some mid-range on the guitars also we don't need any more treble and dico beats. HAHA. Relax don't do it..........
1,WOW!!!!!!,"I don't think i could ever stop laughing about this album....even just thinking about it. I know i can...i know i can.....i know i can. This is the most horrible band i've ever heard but yet its so amusing, well just two songs are....and after playing them over and over laughing at how bad it is....i suppose its worth buying...yeah sure buy it...its totally worth it."
4,The Best New Fall Album In Years,"Most of these neo new wave bands like Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Interpol, etc. etc. etc. leave me cold, being a tired old man who was buying the original versions back in the early 80's. Art Brut, though, are surprisingly really good. They're rougher and a bit more punk than most of their ilk, have a great sense of humor and even with spoken vocals are quite catchy. The band they resemble most closely is The Fall, mostly due to those vocals. Anyway, even if you're normally averse to the kids and their recycled sounds, give a listen to a few tracks off this and it might surprise you, too."
2,Gets Old Real Fast,"OK, I get it. I understand that Art Brut are tongue-in-cheek, and that it's the classic stance of hating rock&roll and loving it at the same time. OH the ambivalence of it all. My main quip is with vocals. Rarely do I enjoy snotty brit twang, and this album did not get a pass. Eddie Argos's vocals are so grating, I hardly got past the first two songs. The music itself is nothing original (much like the lyrics), but is catchy and fun, at times. Basically, the state of Rock & Roll is easy to bash, poke fun at, and criticize. So if you're going to do it, at least have some lyrics that are indeed funny, insightful or otherwise, and not just noting what is already known. As a music and R&R fan, I have to say that this album's worth is overrated and hyped by critics and fans, while Art Brut is laughing at us (rightfully so). If that's what salts your corn, dive in."
2,Disappointing,"If you want repetitive punk rock that thinks it is clever, buy this CD at its inflated import price. It did not grow on me, and it has chastened me to relying on just the reviews posted here. You'd be much better off getting old Replacements, like ""Sorry, Ma......"", if you don't have them. Even the Hives are better than this, and they are tired after two times through."
2,"Creative, original, annoying.","Ok, so it doesn't sound EXACTLY like everything out there. And the lyrics are witty, I'll admit. But I find this album so annoying that I skip EACH TRACK hoping to find the next one more interesting. No luck. This band REALLY LIKES TO REPEAT PHRASES OF MINIMAL INTEREST. I don't ever want to listen to my Art Brut album. It may be better than 99% of what's heard on major channels (both radio and video), but it is still basically unlistenable. Enjoy."
5,Great wrestling book!,"I snapped this book up after I saw it mentioned in Amateur Wrestling News.I read it over three nights and really enjoyed it.My older brothers wrestled and one was 4th at the states years ago,losing to the eventual champion in a close match.It's amazing how the matches stay with wrestlers after many years.This was a great read and I couldn't wait to resume reading after work each night.The 2 wrestlers,Ivan & Bobby are very interesting characters.You find yourself rooting for both but knowing only one can win.Besides wrestling, each boy is dealing with other stressful situations in their life.Personally I liked Ivan better and found myself rooting for him to prevail.I also liked how the book showed the weight cutting and sacrifices wrestlers endure.I consider it the toughest sport there is.I recommend you pick this one up.I was thankful I did."
4,Pinned Revealed,"I really enjoyed reading this book, even though it isn't a true story I think it gave great insight into what the world of wrestling is like. I really wish that the author had told us who wins the state championship game, but I guess he didn't know who he wanted to win, or he wanted both of them to win. I don't know what was running through the author's head, but I really did want to know who won."
2,Great writing/ hate the ending,"I read this class book, while taking a course in YA literature. I thought the book was well written and that the characters faced some realistic problems. I enjoyed the book right up to the last page. Then it was ruined for me.I actually thought I had gotten a bad printing of the book, I went to the book store and checked out a couple of other copies just to make sure the last chapter wasn't missing. It wasn't.I've been watching for a few years now for a sequel, but to no avail.I had my husband, who wrestled in high school, read the book and didn't tell him about the ending, just to test whether anyone else would be as mad as I was. Yikes! He was really angry and told me to never give him a book like that again.I can't imagine that any student reading this book wouldn't be upset by the cliff hanger. Had he actually finished the story I would have given this author's book a much higher rating."
2,Dirty,"This review is written for Christians to warn that Pinned contains sexual immorality. If I had known that it did, I never would have wasted my money on it.If only the author had written a clean book!! Because, aside from the sexual immorality, it was very well written and the characterization was strong and believable. The story is very dramatic. However, it is so disappointing that the guy decided to contaminate his book with sexual immorality. Shame on him for writing such content in a young adult book."
5,Realistic!,"Anybody who has ever been involved with wrestling, parent or wrestler, will enjoy the realistic value of this fictional story that deals with the reality of being a high school wrestler."
5,Swoon like a high school girl again,"I had the ""album"" with most of the early songs that are on this cd, but it has been misplaced through the years. When I discovered this CD I wasted no time ordering it. I have not been disappointed - the early hits bring back old memories and the new music is terrific also. I would say out of all the songs there might be 4 that I don't enjoy as much."
1,Two word: Don't Buy!,"I totally regret buying this book.There are no references to any historical works, nor any martial arts references either. It tells the story of the ninja clans and and the super-ninjas of the more fictious kind.The only worth is the pages in the end that tells a few of the histocal ninja legends. But even these are better written by others.If you are interested in historical ninja - S. Turnbulls book Ninja is a much better choice. If you are looking for the Martial arts aspect, I suggest any book by Grandmaster Masaaki Hatsumi or his students.Some of the tools he has connected to the historical ninja is very modern fiction picked from comic books."
1,Save your money,"This book doesn't have much of anything that the person with the most basic knowledge of a ninja would not know. It tells a lot of WHAT a ninja did and not HOW. For example, you get comments such as (paraphrased) ""Ninjas had a special way of stepping that allowed them to move silently,"" but that is all; you are not told how this technique was accomplished. You are also briefly told about other techniques or devices that without a graph or illustration are impossible to comprehend. Not well organized or written with a lot of typos. You are also not told what are the sources of the author's information. If anyone knows of a decent book witten about ninja techniques, let me know."
3,"Nice reading, but not totally correct","This book is a nice read, but some parts were incorrect. First of all, there was no ninja costume in Japan's history. No black hood, no black suit or anything. Why would a ninja wanna wear such costumes that says, ""hey everyone, I'm a ninja.""? Next is the ninja sword. There is no ninja sword in history too. Why? Because it's a giveaway.Nevertheless, this book was fun and I completed it in one day."
5,Outstanding Entertainment,"An eclectic compilation of traditional Jewish songs that really gives you a bank for your buck. The vocals and instrumentation are exceptional and I enjoyed each and every piece thoroughly. I find myself listening to it almost daily and just basking in the gorgeous sounds from classical to jazz to folk to spiritual. The singers are top notch and I love that real instruments were used giving the music a depth that simulated sounds can't even begin to match. Exceptional all around, this is a real treasure for anyone interested in Jewish music or just great music."
3,American Jewish Music,I have listened to this once since I received it and was not impressed. I am not sure what I was expecting but I was disappointed. I plan to listen to it again and hopefully appreciate it more.
3,Excel Simplified,"I got this book on recommendation from a teacher of an Excel class I was taking at the time. It is very detailed and user friendly and answers most all questions anyone could have about Excel 2003. Unfortunately, I have the 2007 version and some of the items are positioned differently but the general information in the book is still very helpful. Tips and pictures on every page make it impossible not to ""get it""."
5,Excel's advance tools!,Provides the tricks and how to utilize advance tools in Excel 2003. Easy-to-understand methods by showing the real screen appearances & categorized very well.
5,Lovely!,"The pictures and story in this book are fabulous. I love the drawing style, and the story was fun to read. I wish these books would be printed again. I can't find all of the Devlin's other stories and I would love to read ALL the others."
5,Pancakes anyone?,"This is one of my all time favorite children's books. The story & illustrations are wonderful. But the best thing? You guessed it! The pancake recipe in the back of the book. To this day, it is the only pancake recipe I used. I even say the spell."
2,I dont like,The book was ragged and the pictures weren't the sameas the little book that we have had all these many years whichhas been loved and the pancakes made over and over again!
5,See how it began,It's been 25 years and so much in the gay community has changed and so much hasn't. A quarter century ago it seemed unthinkable that Love and Death could ever co-exist. Now we live in the midst of an uneasy truce. See this film and see how the first generation dealt with the unthinkable.
4,Heartbreaking but Eye Opening,"Even though this film may not have had the full impact of it's original version found in type, it had all the necessary ingredients to help one understand the impact of AIDS and it's debut into our society. Without films of this type, people may never understand that AIDS is not predjudice to race, religion, gender or sexual preference. No one is immune from this horrible disease and in my opinion, the purpose to educate people was accomplished. There may be other films that are more graphic or less watered down, but in the end any film about AIDS has value and should be viewed as a valuble learning tool."
2,And the Band Played On,"My cousin wrote the screen play so I was interested in watching this movie. Overall, I found it too preachy, sentimental, and trite. The whole AIDS epidemic is still not really understood by people anyway, so why should I be surprised that a selfish doctor (aren't most of them selfish creatures who fashion themselves to be gods?) is blamed for withholding some life-giving elixir ""cure."""
5,And The Band Played On..and still does!,"Maybe I'm getting more compassionate as the years add up, maybe I'm just realizing the frailty of what it means to be human. I recently bought the dvd, ""And The Band Played On"" from Amazon.com. It deals with the early years of the AIDS crisis and the fear that went with it. Having known several people who died from this horror, it is very hard for me to remember but harder not to.It is a wonderful film and I cry every single time I watch it and if I were chancellor of a major university, I would make this film/DVD mandatory viewing for all sociology and social science majors. If ""And The Band Played On"" doesn't move an individual to fight the fight against AIDS and other immune diseases, YES I'll include Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, etc...then our claim in Heaven will be nothing more then an IOU slip from St Peter.I remember those who died during those years..I will never forget them.sent with love and compassion,Mark Chase"
3,Not as good as the book,"The movie is mostly worth your time, but not as good as Shilts book (which had it's own problems but, still, was better). HBO tried to pack too much of Shilts book into one movie, and a miniseries would have been a better choice. As it is, the movie suffers from too many A-list cameos, which distracts from the flow of the story. After Richard Gere accepted a part, there was a stampede from Hollywood from every big name in the business to get a cameo, and at times it seems HBO did their best to include them all. Audiences didn't go ""Oh, how sad for the victim's brother"". They went ""Hey, even Steve Martin has a part"". Of all of the star cameos, Gere's was the best performance (especially the haunting ""Party's over"" line during the Halloween parade). Also, HBO doubles down on Shilts portrayal of Bob Gallo as a kind of medical Darth Vader, when the truth is, shall we say, somewhat different."
5,An engaging portrayal of one of the modern world's greatest crises,"Having read the book, I felt that the movie was, as is naturally the case, not as thorough or intricate as the story that it is based on, but the acting is great and the key players and events are still intact."
5,The start of an epidemic,"I saw this movie when it aired on prime time television, and it amazed me what content was censored out. Greatly affecting, gorgeous cello soundtrack, I highly recommend it."
5,Monkey See. Monkey Do. Monkey Dies.,"Getting the HIV-AIDs message out was as difficult with Gay Men and Lesbians as it was to the majority of the Straight populase. This was the first TV Movie that was based upon the outbreak of HIV-AIDs. HBO really did a public service by making, then showing a story that brought the subject matter into the living rooms of America.The storyline is acted by total professionals who deliver dynamite performances. The entire production was handled perfectly.Details of the story are available through the ""Editorial Reviews,"" on this page (scroll up).If you are looking for a light entertaining diversion, this is NOT the case here. This is factual, reality based scripting and played for a strong warning to audiences, regardless of their sexual orientation.The only other film (of this specific genre) I consider this film's equal is: ""Longtime Companion.""Watch them both..."
5,Wonderful Movie about the History of HIV/ AIDS,"Every since coming across this movie 5 years ago, I have been a huge fan and read the book soon after seeing it. I was happy to see that the movie really did a good job staying true to the book and the saga of HIV. I am now a science teacher and I always show this in my class when discussing HIV and AIDS. The students always enjoy it and many are moved to read the book, do more research on their own, or even join the cause. This is a movie that everyone should see!!!!"
4,Excellent movie,"If you ever wanted to know more about the beginning of the aids epidemic here in the US, this is the movie for you. They manage to include a ton of information without ever becoming boring or slow moving. Terrific casting makes this a must see movie you won't ever forget."
2,Weak and Uninspired,"Although the film will be an eye-opener for viewers who know little if anything about the factors which encouraged AIDS to move from a disease afflicting the few to a full blown epidemic, to any one in the least knowledgeable it will prove singularly uninspired.Based on the powerful book by Randy Shilts, And The Band Played On had the potential to be one of the single most galvanizing films (and not to mention a fascinating story) ever made. Instead, we receive a watered down, fairly sanitized version of everything which make the book such a knockout.See the film if you must, but you're much better off with the book. If you are interested in the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, I also recommend the film Longtime Companion, which traces the impact of AIDS on a circle of friends living in New York when the disease first began to spread."
3,something went very wrong here,"If a disease showed up that killed 100% of ordinary people,no expense would have been spared or measure left undone.Sometime in the 80's measures and research should have been done to stop this disease.If the disease wasn't associated with homosexuals and IV drug users,measures like those for Syphilis would have been put in place at the earliest moment.As a result of this disease millions have and will in the future dieand world wide, the epidemic still rages pretty much unchecked.The medical community and the CDC failed to dowhat they were supposed to dofor a contagious disease.History will look back and call this the dark ages of medical science."
3,A Bit Dated,"While this movie was very relevant 10-15 years ago its less relevant today. AIDS is no longer the runaway epidemic in the USA as it was years back.The movie in general. Fantastic stars who all do a great job. The movie tends to be more political than I had hoped, but it does blame not only politicians but local gay leaders which was refreshing. Back in the early 80's, AIDS was denied not only by politicans but by the gay community too who didn't want their lifestyle threatened. This movie does a fine job of showing both aspects."
2,"Not abysmal, BUT...","For heavens sake, read Randy Shilts' book instead of watching this mediocrity! The man wrote like a dream and covered the beginning of the AIDS era like no one else could."
3,Couldn't get into it,"I tried to watch this film, and I stayed with it all the way through, but I found it to be drawn out and depressing. I'm not belittling the AIDS crisis, but this movie didn't do anything for me. The only part that really caught my eye was the end when they played a touching Elton John song and they showed clips of famous people and others who had died from the disease, and the AIDS quilt. You'd do better to read the book that this movie was based on. A more interesting film about AIDS, I thought, was PHILADELPHIA."
2,Don't know why I bought this,"Yes I do. Stupid. I knew not to buy and did anyhow. That's the definition of insanity I believe. Didn't even watch all of it. Hmmm, have I thrown it away yet. Just moved to a new house and don't remember seeing it when I unpacked? Guess so."
5,Still Resonates,This was one of the early films about AIDS and it remains a quietly powerful work. We too soon forget the politics and egos that needlessly allowed this disease to spread. Kudos to the cast and crew for a making an excellent screenplay come to life.
5,If You Know Someone,If you have younger friends who were not there while millions died buy this DVD and let them see it. I worked for some time with a youth group and we watched this DVD together. I had to pause it dozens of times to explain what was happening. The younger people up to age 30ish simply have no understanding of this horrific epidemic. Believe it or not I think every school in North America should have this DVD as a class project. I work closely with the AIDS community today and find it difficult to see 16 to 28 year olds now testing positive. This movie gives out a lot of information and the list of people in it will get anyone of any age to watch it... and then watch them cry at the end. This DVD is a gift of life for a friend you may love.
3,not so waterproof,These boots run true to size as stated and are very cute and stylish for a young girl. The problem that we have experienced with this particular pair is the waterproof issue. In the title it states that these boots are waterproof however our first snow indicated otherwise. The price was pretty comparable as well. The only problem we have had is the waterproof issue otherwise these boots are comfortable and well made.
2,this is one weird idea for a cd!,"This cd contains 5 songs from ASIA and 5 songs from BOSTONwhich have been taken all over the place without(it would seem)much logic.While i love those two groups alot,i find this selection ofsongs relatively unsatisfying or incomplete.Forget about this cd and buy a full cd of each of those twogroups instead,it s worth the extra money!"
3,Butterfly Clips,"The clips are the perfect size for my length of hair. I just wish they would grip a little tighter. I didn't like the fact aslo, that Amazon charged me $8.50 for shipping on a product that only cost $1.50."
1,utter garbage,nuff said! took something excellent and made it soulless . i wish i would have listened to it online first. i literally could only stand 30-45 seconds of each song and wanted to throw the cd away before i got home from Best Buy(less than 5 minutes)
3,no buttons,The shorts are nice. My son really likes them. They are just missing the buttons. There was no remark about this in the description.
5,The best of its genre,"What's all the fuss about cranky ol' Ezra Pound? This may answer that question. It may also be the finest piece of literary criticism in the language, the best work of a man who is not merely a critic of the modernist writers, but a great modernist himself. No one who loves 20th Century poetry, fiction and visual art should miss this book."
5,perfect cereal bowl,This is a perfectly sized cereal bowl for the whole family including kids 3 and 5 and even for us parents to help maintain portion control. Love the turquoise color. Also good size for fruit and yogurt. Added bonus: made in the USA.
3,Not that New,"This item was classified as brand new but was clearly not. It had been written in in several places but was in otherwise good shape. However, I specifically wanted a brand new item and this wasn't."
2,served it's intended purpose,"Not the most enthralling read... but it served it's purpose (for a grad class). There was quite a bit of writing inside, but some of the highlighting helped!"
2,too Short,"Short in length so it comes off easily but the delaying Power not bad. I wld not rebuy same brand, if u aggressive and just slightly longer than average it will fall off"
5,Running with Poco,"Poco's Running Horse Compact Disc provides eleven terrific and new songs from veterans Rusty Young, Paul Cotton, and new comer Jack Sundrud. This is a must buy for everyone who enjoys the California Country Pop/Rock Sound of the 60's & 70's.This is Poco's finest effort to date. Poco continues to craft excellent songs, provide solid song arrangements with strong vocals, and use of Rusty's magic steel guitar. Each song is timeless. My favorite tracks are Rusty's ""One Tear at a Time"" and ""Forever""; Paul's ""I Can Only Imagine"" and ""Everytime I Hear that Train""; and Jack's ""Never Loved"" and ""Shake It.""So if you are sitting on a fence don't burn a few songs invest in Running Horse it won't let you down. Also pick up Paul Cotton's Firebird CD it's a great buy."
3,new poco cd,"this is the first cd from the legendary country rock group since 1989's legacy , the group consist of paul cotton, jack sundrud, rusty young and george grantham. the song's that really stick out on this cd are one tear at a time, everytime i hear that train ,and running horse."
2,From pioneers to followers........,"You could remove the Poco name from the cover and replace it with Lonestar,Diamond Rio,Restless Heart or any others of that style and you would never know the difference. This is just another sound-a-like recording coming out of Nashville. Disappointing to see Poco has gone from innovators to followers. Cotton contributes two great songs, Everytime I Hear That Train and I Can Only Imagine. The rest are country radio clones. I know they have a die hard cult following that would praise anything Poco does no matter how bad it might be, but if your looking for that familiar country rock sound that the band abandoned 25 years ago.......well.....it's still missing."
5,the best puller!,I bought this puller after my other pasco puller bent on me. This one is way more heavy duty than all the other pullers I've seen. it's a tool I rarely use but comes in handy when i need it!
3,Good book but caution to those who buy this book used!,"I bought this book and from what I've read and seen, it's pretty good but there is one problem. If you buy this book used....you better make sure the disc is included because that is the only way to do the lessons.I contacted the publisher to ask if I can obtain the disc and they replied that they couldn't.So, I've had this book, can't really do anything without the disc, so with that being said...just wanted to let those of you who are considering in buying it cheap on Amazon ala used, to make sure it comes with the disc."
3,Solo para los nostálgicos.,"Lo compré para acordarme de los viejos tiempos en Costa Rica, cuando Marfil tocaba en bares y discos y la gente se ponía a bailar y pegar brincos oyendo 'Saca Boom'. Me alegro de haberlo comprado, pero la verdad las demás canciones no valen tanto la pena. Sería mejor comprar un disco de los mejores exitos de Marfil, algo que incluya 'Represento', pero dudo que eso vaya a existir en Amazon."
5,Great Book,"This was a great book. I would reccomend this book for kids in grades 3-6. Claudia decides to run away from home, but she doesen't want to do it alone. She decides to pick Jamie, her younger brother to go along with her. After they run away they decide to stay overnight in a museum (the Metropolitan museum of art)....... read the rest to find out the obsticales that come along the way."
5,Inspiration for The Royal Tenenbaums?,"I loved this book as a kid, and I suspect it was also an inspiration for the recent Wes Anderson film The Royal Tenenbaums. In the film's prologue, a young brother and sister run away to the New York Public Archives and live there for a week, sleeping in the hollow base beneath a big taxidermied animal. The film also had the magical, beautiful view of Manhattan that I got as a kid reading this book. Curious stuff! Both book and film are wonderful."
5,Such a great book!,One of my childhood favorites! I recently went to the Met and just had to purchase and re-read the book!
5,midnight museum magic,"Do you like adventure, mystery and fun? Well then this is the book for you. It is about a girl named Claudia (11), and her brother, Jamie(9); they decided to run away to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They worked together which helped them to survive many days and nights in the museum. I learned that you should work together no matter who it is you are working with; your brother, your sister, a friend, or even Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler! I'd love to tell you more, but I can't spoil the story befroe you read ""From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler."""
5,"So well written, it's a pleasurable read for any age.","I loved the book 28 years ago as a ten-year-old girl, and I love it now, reading it aloud to my young sons. Children and adults will find the humor in sometimes the same thing, and in sometimes quite different situations. (My sons and I both think the boy Jamie is a hoot). Ms. Konigsburg's insight into the sharp and curious minds of young boys and girls -- and siblings, at that! -- is right on the mark. The action never lags; the museum/city setting and details draw you in and the dialogue speeds the adventure along. I can't imagine anyone being dreadfully disappointed with this book. Check it out!"
5,"A Great, Fun, Cool Mystery Book","From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler is a mystery book about a brother and sister, Jamie and Claudia who get sick of doing daily chores, and decide to run away. They get a train ticket for New York and ride to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They secretly eat, sleep, and live in the Museum while trying to solve the mystery of who made a famous angel on display. That is when the fun starts!"
5,Fabulous,I loved this book and still love it as an adult. My daughter has enjoyed reading this wonderful book as much as I did.
4,Better the second time,I read this book in elementary school and I am now 22. I remember enjoying it when I was younger and I understood more and enjoyed it even more this time around.
3,This book really catches my attention!,I thought this book was exiting. It was boring in the beginning because I didn't understand why they were running away. When they got to the museum it was intresting. Also while they were figuring out the mystery it was exiting. I think this book is a good book for anyone who likes mysterys.
3,This book was exciting when the mystery broke out.,"I gave this book 3 stars because I didn't understand why they ran away, when they got to the musuem it was a little better but not much.But when the mstery finally broke out it was exciting. I think this would be a good book for anyone who likes mysterys."
4,wierd in beggining,I thought it was a very good book. It was very exciting. It was exciting because it had a lot of clues. The clues led up to the solution to the mystery very well. I think a person who likes art would like this book.
5,Fond Memories...I enjoyed it as much as my son did!,"There are not very many books that I have a clear memory of reading at a very young age and this is one of them. It left an indelible impression on me as a wonderful tale of adventure with suspense and a mystery thrown in. I did not recall the name and I think I googled ""children's book metropolitan runaway"" to find the title! I bought this recently to share with my 6 year old son and my 8 year old daughter. Tonight, I finished reading the book to my son and we both loved it. The magic and mystery are all there and the conclusion was even more fun for the fact that I didn't remember how it ended. Now my daughter, an avid reader, can enjoy it!Presentation wise I'm undecided on the ""Deckle Edge"" paper. It does confer a nice feel to the book but it does make it tough to leaf through it looking for a particular page.I could not more highly recommend this book. Buy it now to share it with your kids, to relive part of your childhood, or both!"
5,Classic,"What a wonderful book, it is not only well written, but it is well researched. I loved this book as a child, it was so fun to follow these kids on their adventure. The description of the Met is wonderful and the story is so joyful to follow. This is always one of the first children books I recommend, I have never heard from a child or an adult quite frankly that didn't love it, it has a huge following. READ THIS BOOK"
5,It started my passion for reading,"Last week a few of us on line were remembering our childhood favorite books. I read this one at age 11 and loved it. I wasn't the only one in the group who loved the adventure. Now, I am buying two copies-- one for my library and one for a young girl."
5,I read this when I was a kid. One of my all time favorites,"This book is really terrrific. I'm happy I found a copy for my step-daughter. If you're from the NYC area, you can take your child to visit the Met and see the rooms where the kids sleep!"
5,My review,I really liked this book! It really makes you want to read the next chapter! I didn't want to quit! This is 1 of the best book i've ever read! It is very good! i would recommend this to anyone!
2,Disappointed!,"I bought this book as one of several presents for our daughter who loves to read. I read this when I was her age and loved it, and the story is not why I am disappointed. The quality of this book is disgraceful- it looks like the pages were cut out and bound together by a three year old. The edges of the pages look like the were put next to a paper shredder. Not at all happy with this purchase!"
5,Great book!,"My grown kids knew about this book, and for some reason I didn't. They brought it to my attention in discussing a news article about an octopus that lived out of view in a laboratory, going nocturnally from aquarium to aquarium to live and eat, rather like the kids in this story, hiding in the Met. A fine story, well written, for kids and even their grandparents."
3,Review for this book,It was a good book but not one of my best ones I will want to read more books from this author.
4,A book for every one!,"The book From the mixed up files of Basil E.Frankweiler is a great book. It's about a girl that wants to runway with her brother from home. The girls name is Claudia and her brothers name is Jamie. Claudia wants to pick her younger brother because he has all the money that he got from his friend by trading cards. They leave the day they have muisc because they take there instruments that day. But they don't take their instruments they put clothes in the cases instead. At the end of the bus ride everyone got off but Claudia and James. When the driver left the two went into the museum. They hid in the bathroom when the museum closed and found a bed to sleep in. They found a sculpture with two rings overlapping. Claudia thought Michaelangelo did it but found it signed ""the mixed-up files of Basil E. Frankweiler. I liked this book because it was full of adventures and excitement. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like adventure and excitement in their reading."
5,A piece of my childhood returns each time I read it,"""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"" has got to be the longest, most confusing title of any classic children's novel, and I wouldn't change a word of it! Having read my copy to pieces in the fourth and fifth grade, I recently bought another copy to have in my daughter's library. Even though she's only 3 now, I know she'll love this book in a few years. To this day, whenever I go into a museum, I find myself wanting to sneak into the bathrooms and hide there until after closing, just so I can sleep in one of those old beds and jump into the museum fountain for the spare change! The novel is as good now as it was thirty years ago, with all the same simple beauty of this fantasy of the successful runaway. If you haven't read it yet, I envy you. If you have, read it again -- it just gets better with age."
5,This book is simply marvelous!,"The story is very well written and filled with adventure for young readers. I read it years ago when I was in elementary school. Since then I have recommended it to both of my younger sisters, and just last year to my daughter. When she began doing book reports for school this year, it was definitely on the top of her list! The story is so timeless that kids from several generations can relate to Claudia's feelings of restlessness and under appreciation, as well as her relationship with her little brother. I suggest it to all parents for their 4th - 6th grade children."
4,I think this was a good book.,I think this was an adventurous book. The reason I think this is because you did not know what was going to take place right after the part you just read. I also thought the characters were very brave. they even stayed at the museum by themselves so that shows that they are responsible and can take care of themselves.
4,Great for young and old!,"This book mixed humor, suspense, misery and mystery to form a truly captivating book. After reading this, I bought the book on tape. My family listened to it about 5 times in the car on the way to Boston and back home. It's the kind of book you never get sick of"
4,A brilliant winner of the Newbery Award!,"Fun and intelligence are mixed together in this award-winning book for young readers. BUT, SURPRISE-----adults will enjoy it too! From bossy, know-it-all Claudia and her gambling, cheapskate brother James to the cynical, eccentric Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, the characters are appealing and real. They have their adorable little quirks and are genuinely likable. At the same time, the idea of living in a famous art museum---sleeping in its bed, hiding luggage and out-smarting guards, is fascinating. It provides James and Claudia the opportunity to return home ""different""---learn about themselves and about culture. OK, that sounds boring, but it isn't ! Learning about art is just the apparent goal; uncovering the SECRET that everyone wants to know is the real one. Guess who James and Claudia must turn to? The writing is FAST, FUNNY AND ORIGINAL . I strongly recommend it"
3,light and pleasing but not teasing,"Two siblings, a boy and a girl, run away from home and hide in the Metropolitan Museum of New York, where they become involved in trying to find out whether a new statue was the work of Michelangelo. In the end they do find out by talking to the person who sold the statue to the museum.So there you have it: easy to read, easy to summarize, pleasing and somewhat diverting. It's no brain teaser, though, it didn't really draw me in, I didn't feel captivated by the language or the story - I cared what happened to the characters but in a detached way, sort of like you wish your neighbors well but don't ponder too much on it.I don't really understand why this is supposed to be a classic: I mean it's not bad, but come on: can it really compare with something like Pinocchio, or Alice? It's too much of a light souffle for that, in my humble opinion."
3,yellow group review,The story was okay. I was suprised that Cluadia and Jamie didn't get caught in the museum. Also I think that the story was like a mystery because they were finding information on Michael Angelo.The story was also a little exciting. I would recommend this book to 10 and 11 year olds.
4,The Very Good Book,"The book is really good. Two children named Claudia and Jamie run away from home, because Claudia does not like it at home. She needs Jamie to go with her because of his money and his radio. So they run away to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. But, there is a mystery to solve. Who made Angel? Will they get caught living in the Met? Most of all, will they solve the mystery of who made Angel?ClariceChicago, IL"
3,A must read,I just finished From The Mixed Up Files Of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler I liked this book because it was easy to read. I also liked that there was a mystery in it. One part in the book was they got off the bus and they had to walk 40 blocks to the meusum. If you want to know how it feels to hide out in a meusum read this book.
1,The mixed up files of me Basel e frankwiler,This book is a very bad book because it was not very exciting and there are no cliff hangers and it is a very boring book$$$
2,Lame,"This is the second book i had to read in school. The first one was called Rules. I am only goving this book 2 stars for 2 reasons, one its five strars COMPARED to Rules. And second they acctually do something! Run away! Yay! even though its a lame place to run away to, there is no action, little comidy, the mystery is boring. If you want a real childrens book, try Percy Jackson. Its New York times best #1 bestseller. WAY better then this dumb book."
2,"Not exactly ""heroic.""","If you don't like the idea of kids running away, becoming brats, thinking of their parents as ""bad"" and acting sassy towards an elderly woman trying to help them, then forget this book. Definitely not worth your time."
5,JUST EXCELLENT!,"I must have read this book a half dozen times when I was a kid and on a recent whim, picked it up again. It is just as enjoyable now as it was then. Definitely a great book for all ages!"
4,Still good after all these years,"I feel funny reviewing books that are older than I am (this was published in 1967), but I will share what I thought. I thought this was a cute story, and I don't know how I missed this one when I was young...it seems like it would have been just my style! And, except for a few details (such as how much things cost and the fact that Claudia wears a petticoat), it doesn't feel like it's outdated. I thought a couple of parts were particularly funny, like when Claudia and Jamie find an unopened candy bar on the ground, and Jamie wants to eat it. Claudia says ""You better not touch it. It's probably poisoned or filled with marijuana, so you'll eat it and become either dead or a dope addict."" How funny!"
5,I Want to Go There!,"I want to go to New York to see this museum. This book was incredible and I loved the style of writing and the way the story unfolded letting each character have their own voice. I loved the notes at the end from the author. I really could tell she loved these characters and did care about their ever after. Every child should read this book. Wait, every adult should read this book!"
3,A Classic,"This is one of those books that deeply affected me as a kid. I, too, was the oldest and had three brothers (creepy, huh?) Running away to live in a museum: what a great idea, even if you have to drag your little brother along. The only thing I dislike about this book is that it seemed to end too quickly, and the ending didn't make sense to me. But I have noticed that with a few of Konigsburg's books. All in all, worth reading and buying."
2,This book is not good.,It's about two spoiled kids who run away and secretly live in a museum to figure out a mystery. I never actually understood what the mystery was while reading this. Claudia and Jamie are spoiled filthy brats.
1,It is not real book,"When I got the book, I just found it is not high quality, crudely made. But when one student in my class showed me the one she bought from bookstore, I found much difference, the cover, the paper quality, the text color. And what make me unbelievable is her nice book cost $6.99, while my crappy one cost $9.99."
3,Not my favorite book.,"Unfortunately, I was made to read this book in fifth grade, and have disliked it ever since. I have always loved reading, even then, but this book just never sat well with me.The story was good, it had exciting events that makes any kid want to be apart of it, but the way it was written could have been better. I found that I could not get attached to the characters, and their reactions were not very believable. The last part that I disliked about this book was that there was a long narration of the kids in the museum, but the actual part about the mystery was at the very end of the book.I wish I could give examples of my reasons, but it was so long ago that it's hard for me to remember. I simply remember why I never liked it."
2,Not So Good,"If you would like to have a adventure, you will like this book. But in my opinion, the book was not good. They all were talking and fighting a lot. The only cool thing in it was that they ditched school. The book had a lot of weird critters. The book was kind of hard to understand."
1,not satisfied :(,"This is the worst book i have ever read. Just keep in mind that everything i say is true... in my perspective. I don't like this book mainly for two reasons... one is that i read this for school and we had to do a lot of comprehension questions with it... so that just ruined the future of me having feelings for this book. The second reason i hated this book is because it included tooooo much information. On every single topic/thing in the muesuem, the author included information about it... this book got tiring to read at times. But, that's just what i think, so i would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading flat-out information."
1,The BOOK THAT COULDENT CUT IT!,"The Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E FrankwielerBY:E.L.KONIGSBURG OWEN,NEW JERSEY 10I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS JUST HORRIBLE BECAUSE YOU COULD PREDICT EVERYTHING AFTER THEY WENT TO THE METROPOLATAN MUSEUM. THE MIXED UP FILES SHOULD OF MADE A BOOK BEFORE IT TO SHOW HOW THE KINCADE FAMILY TREATED CLAUDIA.YOU SHOULD NEVER READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,My Take on the Kincaids,"Claudia and Jamie Kincaid run away from home to the Metropolitan Museum in New York. They hope to go back home and be different. They have found a statue called ""Angel."" People believe that Angel was designed and created by Michealangelo but is is not confirmed yet that he is the sculptor. Claudia and Jamie are out on an adventure trying to confirm he made it. They go to Mrs. Frankweiler's house and get a lot of information from her and about her.I liked this book a lot because I like adventure books. This is definitely an adventure book because Claudia and Jamie are sneaking in the museum, hiding, and the whole running away part is scary because I didn't know if they would get caught, or not get the sketch from Mrs. Frankweiler."
5,From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler,I had several students ask for this book. They have leaning disabilities but are great auditory or visual learners. I have the CD also for other students to follow along.
4,Good Read,"I reread From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. The book details a young adult's struggle to want more and also provides a nice little adventure. The book is clearly written for young people, but still good. I definitely recommend it!"
5,As wonderful as it was when I was ten years old,"I loved this book as a child and so far this is the only book that I've bought from an ""agency"" publisher, I just couldn't pass it up. I was surprised at how well it stands the test of time. Sadly the fountain is no longer in the Met but other than that it's just how I remember it. A great story for young adults and those young at heart."
4,Mrs.Basil or Mrs.Bazil,This book was one of my favorite books but the movie was so much different. For one they call Mrs Basil Mrs Bazil which is really weird. Claudia and Jamie look totally different and thy have an older brother steve and no younger brother. so if you really want to read a good book read Mrs. Basil. ( Don't watch the movie )
3,Better for Grandma than the today kids,"It was surely a fine book in a time my mother was a child, so it reminds me of our classical sweet kitsch ""Heidi"". The children act as I've never seen children act - don't even forget to change their clothing, to go to the laundry and to count every cent to pay for fees ... - sooo very good children are parents pride, aren't they? For me it is a (little bit outdated) projection of what adults wish how children should act, historically interesting, nothing what my child will probably enjoy today."
4,Great book if no errors.,"This is a great book but I gave it a 4 star because I have fond some errors in this book I have listed them below: 1: page 68 paragraph 3: ""Jamie answered, ""Oh, I... 2: page 93 paragraph 7: What kind of a sentence is that? Crushed up!"" 3: page 109 paragraph 6: ...began walking up town with him as fast as he she ... If you did not have these 3 little errors then it would get a five star from me."
3,Mystery Statue,"Claudia and Jamie ran away from home, and they find a statue named Angel. Find out the secret behind the statue in From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. I liked the book. The book got into the mystery at a good speed. If you like books that are not suspense, but are fun to read I would recommend this book for you. See-yah!"
4,It was a nice book,It was a nice book I gave it 4 stars because it had a nicecontent. It could have been a little better because they could haveused a little more detail in the story. They could have told a little more about the characters.
5,The Best Kids Book Ever!,This book is all about how Claudia and Jamie Kincaid run away to the Metrpolitian Museum of art in NYC...and it rocks! Claudia finds a wonderful statue named ANGEL and won't leave the museum until she finds out who sculpted this wonderful statue.
4,From the Mixed-up files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler,"It was a good book because it was full of suspense, action, funny stuff, and laughter. I would like to read it again somtime when I have free reading time."
4,Nightfall,The game was a gift for my son. He has played the game and was very satisfied with the gameplay.
4,Nice expansion to the original campaign.,"I was about 3/4 through the original Guild Wars game when I got Nightfall and I must say it's an excellent expansion and pretty good (a little smaller than the original) as a standalone package.The free gameplay in addition to the very well balanced system will have players thinking and constantly adapting well beyond their maximum level. Players can also join groups called guilds and alliances to play and chat with same minded individuals throughout the 3 games (this one, the original, and the expansion Factions).Graphics and sound look good and can be used with almost maximum settings on my two year old laptop. All in all, Nightfall is an okay game to start with and a great expansion to the orinigal Guild Wars game."
2,Do not feel like a MMPORPG,"Most of the time I spent playing by myself with no interaction with other players in a party. You can only see people that are not in your party in cities what makes the game kinda boring as in the ""roleplay"" section of the game all you gotta do are quests.The PVP section of the game is somehow funny... But this it's really not a *real* MMORPG.I would not recommend this product if you enjoyed games like Ultima Online, Lineage or WOW. But if you want a game where you can join in a day and in that same day start facing other players in pvp than go ahead."
3,Poor Customer Support,"Although the game itself is interesting, the customer support from the supplier was most unsatisfactory. Instead of receiving 2 disc in the package, there was only one. When we contacted the customer support concerning this, we were told that all material had been sent via Amazon, and they were not responsible if we did not receive the complete package.We relayed this information on Amazon's customer service and never received a response from them."
4,"definitely addictive, but great game!","This game is awesome. The graphics are pretty sweet,and it has a good storyline. If you don't want to do the RPG part of the game, there's always PvP which is always a blast. The new Paragon and Dervish professions are pretty cool too."
2,same old - same old,"Very disappointed. Paid alot for the same old game. If you enjoyed it so much you want to do GW over again, go ahead and buy it. Not enough innovation to justify the money."
3,fun but way to short (only 20 lvls),its a great game but with only 20 lvls and dosent take long to git to but the game play is good the is story so so over an ok game not the best but good non the less not recommended
5,Great Time in the Night,"This is a great game and this is what 2nd installment of Guild Wars should have been. This has everything and even more that a true addition to such game like Guild Wars should contain. Interesting story line, many new towns, skills, competitive areas and addition armors."
1,NCSoft MMO Killers,"NCSoft is a horrible company to deal with, they have a long history of canceling successful MMOs and leaving fans out cold. MMOs are a great social experience and they become a significant part of the player's life. If you value those aspects, then don't look at anything published by this company. Sooner than later they WILL cancel the game on you."
3,Piercing studs.,"The price is great and I have used them four times to pierce my ears. The only problem is that by the time that my ear healed, the color in the stone faded to a milky white with black at the edges only."
5,The Best of Desorden Publico,Aqui tienen el mejor grupo de Ska de Venezuela para el mundo. Este grupo mezcla varios ritmos latinoamericanos para dar el mejor disco de toda su carrera. Here you have the best group of Ska from Venezuela to the world. This group blends many latinoamericans rythms for creating the best disc in its career.
4,"Xcentric,Eclectic,full of ryhthym and latin hot sounds!","Desorden Publico has been around the Venezuelan music scene for a long time. This title could be their best perfomance ever, including Simon Guacamayo (a ska song with a very eclectic ""vallenato"" and ""cumbia"" sound), Latex (makes you wanna jump and jump and jump some more, and finally Aya Callo. We will wait for Desorden to come up with something even better than this one.Extremely recommended for those searching for new and different sounds!"
3,Maginary the Fairy,"Based on previous reviews, I expected a lot more ideas from this book. In planning a birthday party for my 6-year-old daughter, I had hoped to find more practical crafts and games for children. I was dissappointed that few of the ideas were original-- many of them I already had. I mean, come on, I thought the page dedicated to making fairy invitations could be more creative than: Get a paper, fold it in half, write the party information on the inside and outside, glue sparkly things to the invitation, address and stamp the envelope, put the invitation inside, and mail it. I may adapt a couple of the crafts for our party, but the flower fairy dolls are too difficult for children to make themselves, and I think many of the crafts and games I already have will be more fun. If you are experienced with throwing good theme parties, you probably don't need this book. If you need ideas and don't have many of your own, this book will get you started."
5,Fabulous activity book for children and parents!,"If you or your child is fascinated by fairies and loves to create props for imaginary play, this is the book for your family! My five year old daughter has used this book almost every day since receiving it last month. Most of the projects she has picked have needed some guidance or hands-on help from an adult, but she can participate fully in their completion. My nine year old would be able to do most of the projects independently. We've made fairy dust, and hand sewn bags to carry it. The stick puppets and fairy treasure box are used almost daily. My daughter is busily planning her next birthday party entirely from the pages of this book! My favorite feature is that while the directions are thorough and can be followed by older children, they leave plenty of room for individual creativity. Your fairy lover can take the authors' suggestions and easily adapt each project to her own style!"
3,Good for Beginners,"Be honest, this book is, as what its title said, good and well written for dummies or those who's not familiar with windows registry. If you want to look for advanced tips/skills to teach you how to fine-tune or edit your registry, you're better to find another books for advanced/power users."
3,Good for Beginners,"Be honest, this book is, as what its title said, good and well written for dummies or those who's not familiar with windows registry. If you want to look for advanced tips/skills on fine-tune or edit your registry, you're better to find another books."
5,THIS DOES BARBARO PROUD,"This Barbaro Beenie Baby is just adorable and downright cuddly. Proceeds go to the BARBARO FUND at UPENN NEW BOLTON CENTER. It is wonderful for young and old alike. Many FOBs (Friends of Barbaro), who post online on the TIM WOOLLEY RACING site have found great comfort in their ""Baby"" since our beloved Barbaro's passing."
3,Not so good,"I have unfortunately gone through a few of these watches. Problems with my watch have been the following:1. Backlight burns out frequently2. Poor quality on the wrist band3. Can't remove battery on your own, you have to send it back to the manufacturer or spend obscene amounts of money to have a watch maker do it (this feature has been remedied on newer models.The concept of this watch is great, but the quality is quite poor."
4,"Good, not perfect.","I have this watch for about 6 months and I like it a lot. Few comments are:Good:- The watch is pretty accurate (I just calibrated my compass one time and, even traveling a lot, it has worked perfectly);- The size is not so big. I'm man but even in my wife's arm it fits well;- It has a beautiful design.Bad:- The materials are not the best (the center button does not work anymore and the ring, used to calibrate the compass, seems to be locked right now).Why am I giving 4 stars? I had different watchs from Suunto, all of them more expensive and bigger than this one. The size and the ""all information in one screen (time, date, temperature and weather forecast are shown together)"", plus the update Highgear did in the past months make this watch the best value for the money (an besides, I paid only $80 at Amazon website)."
3,Highgear bands suck,"Why do watch manufacturers keep putting these cheap, uncomfortable rubber bands on their otherwise good watches? The Highgear (unlike the Suunto) band is almost impossible to remove, and if you DO remove it, you'll find that it's impossible to even slip one of those The Bands under the pins, and then you'll find that it's also impossible to put the rubber watch band back on once you've failed to upgrade it. At least the Suunto manufacturer offers a little kit that makes it VERY easy to put a really nice velcro band on their watches. Once I wear out or break my brand-new Highgear, I'll be going back to the Suunto."
4,High Gear Axis,"Bought this off of Campmor for 80$. Once you set your local elevation the weather prediction is pretty on top of things. It will forecast probable weather patterns for the upcoming 6 hours. The compass is damn good as well, just be sure to calibrate it daily if you want really good readings. the thermometer doesnt work when it's in conctact with your skin cause the metal watch frame picks up body heat easily but if you hang it off a belt or backpack for 30 minutes you'll know exactly what temperature it is."
1,This watch never came.,I bet this watch would have been amazing.... but it never showed up. Check the seller's profile before confirming sale.
3,Highgear watch review,Nice watch with easy to read numbers however having problems with the Altimeter and Compass. You have to go through a lot of steps to calibrate and you must calibrate these every day. Temperature is not accuate as it does not compensate for body temp.
3,good but not great,"the time and date is easy to read and checking time in the dark with the glow numbers is neat. I haven't figured out how to use the barometer, altimeter or digital compass. maybe i didn't following the directions correctly when i first got the watch. it doesn't seem to be very accurate. Having a watch with all these features sounds really cool. if you don't have to use the features and your getting it to just say that you have a watch with all theses features then go for it. If you do need to use the features then i suggest on passing up on this one for a more accurate watch."
5,Paints a picture....,"I could hardly improve on the other review. Mr. Adams is incredibly skillful with the written word. My appreciation of American history, New York history, and the Erie Canal were all improved by these stories....enjoyably. This book has my unqualified recommendation, for ANYONE, but most of all for modern kids, who need the historical perspective these stories provide."
5,Lawrencemania!!,This is a great & quite long documentary about Lawrence detailing his activities when he helped the Arabs create an uprising against the Turks during WWI. It was shown nearly 10 years ago on The History Channel for those lucky enough to have seen it.It covers pretty much of his known life in detail from when he was a boy & then was assigned as a map clerk in Cario as a Captain & later of course his tragic death on his motor cycle.From the asking price it looks as if it's becomming quite rare & who knows when they'll shown it on TV again for free?
3,Stretcher please!,"The DVD is just silly. Not worth the $10 it added to the price. Assembly is a bit difficult due to small diagram and less than complete nature of instructions. The (pre-assembled) cam device sometimes does not lock when nearing the peak point of the stretch. That said, it is the most comfortable, and useful stretching machine I have owned."
5,Keepsake,I bought this toy as a keepsake for my niece. She is newborn so hasn't had anything to do with it yet. my son has the blue one and wags it absolutely everywhere. The pink ones are scarce these days so this one was a great find. I love it and I'm sure that one day my niece will too!
5,Pink Monkey,I made a diaper cake for my daughter's baby shower and I used this monkey as a topper for the cake. My daughter loves monkeys and she's having a girl. This was the perfect topper. She loved it!
3,Come Sail Away is BUTCHERED!,"Bought this collection years ago. 3 songs that I absolutely love on a compilation! Now I don't have to buy the full CDs that they were originally were on! Woo-hoo! Well, to quote an old Meat Loaf song ""2 out of 3 Ain't bad"". ""Mama Told Me Not to Come"" is an excellent song (written by Randy Newman I believe) that isn't on 3 Dog Night's Greatest Hits. ""Still the One"" is one of my all time faves, great driving beat in a feel-good song. Now for the not so great, ""Come Sail Away"" is completely butchered. The entire 2nd verse is DELETED. I was listening on headphones and I thought the CD had skipped! Not the case, it had been edited. That seems to happen alot on greatest hit compilations by various artists. In any event, you're better off getting Styx Greatest Hits for this song, at least you'll get the full version."
4,fine introduction to zen practice,"This is a good little book introducing Zen practice. The introductory chapters offer a concise overview of Buddhism and Zen Buddhism. Basic concepts like faith, doubt, mindfulness and awareness are clearly explained. The mechanics of meditation from sitting, how to place the hands, etc. are well done. This latter section is reminiscent of Philip Kapleau's Three Pillars of Zen because the author studied under Kapleau. Overall, a solid book to give novices who want to clarify some points and just get started."
4,A good start but not long enough,"I felt that this book was a good start; it certainly gave me a clear picture of the interesting nature of Zen. However, I was looking for more of a instructional as well as informative book -- I found only the informative parts here."
2,lost my item!,"I needed this product ASAP as my roots were showing and I do my own color at home. few days later the tacking information displayed that the item was delivered while I received nothing! I had to contact the seller and inform them about the situation. They said they will look into it. One week later I still didnt hear from the seller nor received the item. I eneded up going to Sally Beauty Supply where I got exactly the same product much cheaper ( obviously because no shipping or handling). few days later the item appeared on my doorsteps. Thank you but I didnt need it anymore. Never again, I will go to Sally Beauty Supply from now on."
1,This book basically sucked.,"I thought this book was going to help me shapeshift, but all he talks about is Iran and his life. I have no clue why someone would buy this unless they wanted to sit through boring talk. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except for a World War 2 veteran."
5,Can we shapeshift society?,"After reading this book I believe so. This book is a must read for all activists working for the full potential of humanity. From Mr. Perkin's own journey into the world of shapeshifting we learn and see how our societies have shapeshifted in the past, a real clue for how to influence humanity on a global basis today. I learned that the most basic tenent of shapeshifting is absolute non-judgment and I am now convinced I can individually impact the future of our world."
5,Eye opening and thought provoking,"This book covers two areas that are important to me: Environmentalism and Spiritualism. It is a autobiography of one mans journey to learn to shapechange and how he comes out of it understanding the importance of changing the community around him. A book about a life story, about some tribal beliefs, not a book on technique."
5,Transforming,"From the moment I turned the first page, I started my journey. A journey into transformation. This book can help one shapeshift emotions, as well as one's life, if need be. I loved it and study it.Thank you John. ""Blessed Journeys"""
4,Excellent and fascinating.,Very interesting topic. I could relate with some of the stories in the book. A must read to anyone who is willing to face that which the intellect has no place. Get rid of fears and follow the compass within.
5,Shapeshifting into a more Real reality,"Love it! Awesome insight, techniques, and story. If you want to change your life and your past, read it now!"
5,Shapeshifting,"Excellent - chapter 7 The Nature of Ecstasy and Dreams Versus Fantasies, alone is worth the price of the book. The stories, the exercises, the highly readable format and the indigenous true power lessons make this a must read."
4,Works great!,"Works like a champ. Bluetooth is prohibited in the office, but this is OK with the security folks and it is faster to boot. The only downside is that the connector can be a bit tricky to line up right with the phone."
1,Disappointment!!!,This was not what I expected. I very quickly tired of the focus on selling light bulbs.
4,Magnificent,"This kid is so talented! The way this show was put together, the artist, and Little JJ himself wasn't anything short of spectacular. I had seen him in two movies, but had no idea he was so talented. I'd recommend this to anyone, children or adult."
1,Misrepresentation,The picture shown for this item is not what you receive when you place an order. Ace blames Amazon - Amazon blames Ace. Returned item and have yet to receive my credit. Very disgusted!
3,Hearse of a Different Color,"Hitchcock Sewell and his Aunt Billie are conducting a wake at their funeral home, when the corpse of a young woman is literally dumped on their doorstep. Hitch has no thoughts of finding the woman's murderer, but his TV meterologist girlfriend, Bonnie, has other ideas. Bonnie, frustrated by her career stall, convinces Hitch to help her investigate the murder; so she can prove her journalistic ability. Funny with snappy dry dialogue and plenty of interesting characters make this book a solid read.I did think the book, as well as the first one in the series, The Hearse You Came In On; has a few spots of unnecessary filler. Although, it doesn't really detract from the reader's overall enjoyment of the book, it is noticeable."
2,Rated good-new but clearly used,Product descried as good-new condition but came clearly used. The paper cover was ripped/tattered/frayed at the top and the hardcover binder was creased suggesting that it had been clearly used and should have been described as such in the description. It's obviously a dated book and in decent shape despite the tattered and creased appearance. The pages are in seemingly great shape at quick flip through. Overall happy with the purchase as it's all about the context but wasn't happy with the fact that it was described as good-new when it should have been described as used.
4,"Hi, honey!","Petty Booka is a Japanese girl ukulele duo. On this CD they sing American Christmas songs. There is something cute about girls with Japanese accents singing in English. ""Cute"" is actually a good description for the whole CD. It's a lot of fun, and if you are looking for a Christmas CD that is a little ""different"", you should check it out. I should mention that the CD is only 30 minutes long, and the last two songs are duplicates of songs that appear elsewhere on the album, but this time with Japanese lyrics."
4,A Must for heavy fuel users,"This is the most comprehensive and complete work for the person charged with procuring, blending or burning heavy fuels. All commonly used test criteria for heavy fuels are contained here, with a wealth of charts and graphs to assist the reader in determining exactly what the properties of any given fuel are and how those properties will affect the consumption. If you handle, sell or consume residual fuels or fuel blends, this is your best source for information."
5,EL MEJOR DISCO DE VICTOR MANUELLE,VICTOR MANUELLE NUNCA DEJA SORPRENDER A SU PUBLICO EN SUS DISCOS. ESTE ES A MI ENTENDER EL MEJOR DISCO DE VICTOR MANUELLE. ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES SONEROS EN LA HISTORIA DE LA SALSA. VICTOR MANUELLE ES UN CANTANTE COMPLETO!
1,Esto no es salsa...........................,"La musica de Victor Manuelle es floja y no se puede clasificar como Salsa. En realidad es un sonsonete recyclado en cada disco. Como instructor de baile de salsa puedo decir que las personas se frustran tratando de bailar salsa con la musica de Victor Manuelle. Les digo que si quieren escuchar y bailar buena Salsa escogan la musica de la Sonora Poncena, Willie Rosario y El Gran Combo entre otros..........Eso si es musica de verdad......."
5,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SALSA ALBUMS!!,"I love all the songs that are in this album. I love the rhythm! All the songs are very danceable. When I listen to it, I have to get up & dance. He's an extraordinary salsa singer!! I give him 5....never mind, 50 stars!!"
2,This Feels Not Right,"Sometimes, many new artists don't seem to adequately find some decent values within good songs. It does seem to take a lot for those artists and thensome. For Maroon 5, their second song does seem to falter a little bit, and not have the decent feel Harder To Breathe compiled. This Love does seem a little bit quirky at first, but does not feel like it is a strong hit. It sounds like a good party anthem, but not all the way as longful and lasting. Still, it does beat other good songs out there these days. I just don't know if Maroon 5 will have a better single in the future, but maybe it'll happen soon."
5,Pleasure in hearing such good music!,"It's incredible how now and then new groups come along, showing so much talent...In this world of music created for purely commercial purposes, it's a pleasure listening to great music still being made. And this is just the case with ""This love"", be Maroon 5...A song with great rhythm, catchy melodies and lyrics, you are immediately trapped in the musical potential this group has to offer...The singer is superb, demonstrating the influence of one the greatest singers of all time, Mr. Stevie Wonder, and the bass player and drummer are truly excellent.I truly recommend this single, in fact, this record, to anyone who desires to listen to one of the most talented groups to come along in a long time."
3,catchy cut,this Love was a catchy cut. very Jackson 5esque vibe going on with the Groove and vocals. I tend to like some of Maroon 5's singles as to there albums. this song was catchy and still sounds pretty good.
5,best watch I've ever owned,"This is the best watch I've ever owned and has lasted the longest. I've had this watch for over 4 years, it runs great, cleans up easliy, always looks nice. I love the mesh band and is easily adjustable, no need to take links out to adjust. The date is a little hard to read, but my eyes are older. The next watch I get will definitely be a Skagen!"
5,Funniest Book Ever on Pro Wrestling,"If I could give this book, ten stars, I would. Of course, I'm biased because I'm the author. I loved compiling the quotes for this book. I always knew pro wrestlers were funny, I just had no idea how funny! Let me give you a few:Jerry Lawler on Rikishi--""His belly button doesn't have lint--it has sweaters.""Jerry Lawler on Mankind--""He's not too smart, but he leads the league in nose hairs.""Vince McMahon on Boxing--""The trouble with boxing is that it lacks credibility.""For 998 more funny one liners about pro wrestling, I urge you to buy this book. For more info about my books, contact me at glennliebman.com. Thank you and enjoy the book."
1,No even a trader,"I though Nick Leeson was once a good trader who have lost it all, but I fact he was just a back office operator who was send to the floor of the SIMEX to take order from clients. He never make money trading, nor have trading strategies. He just sell put to have income to cover some handling order mistakes. After he lost too much he buy futures contracts to try to come back. Also note that this book is so small that you can read it in 30 minutes."
4,Ready for some heavy analysis?,"Speelman has a reputation for exhaustive analysis and deeply conceived endgame strategies. This book certainly reinforces both of these descriptions, but Speelman also shows a bloodthirsty side! His organization is a bit unusual, dividing the games into two general sections (""Growing up as a Chessplayer"" and ""Themes""). This has certain advantages, but given the depth of his commentary (sometimes spending more than two pages on a single move), I would prefer a more traditional format. The games are entertaining and instructive. I have always been a fan of Speelman's style, and this book ranks among the year's best. However, I wonder how many readers will actually go through every comment of this densely packed trove."
5,Great design!,I've found it be very handy when travelling multiple time zones and keeping track of the time at home.
4,Camcorder Bag,"Great camcorder bag, just the right size. I especially like the detachable storage for items you don't need on your outing."
3,"Trust the reviews, these fruits are TINY","This set is very well made, and I trust the quality and safety of Plan Toys. However, the fruits are really teeny tiny. I gave this item as a gift, and I wished they were a bit bigger."
5,why are two of them not cutting toys??,Toy is great. Pieces are overall small -- wish they were more life size.But honestly that't not as big of a deal as the fact that two of the veggy/fruits are not cutable. The bannana and mushroom are not cut toys! LAME. So far the velcro is holding up I wish they had done bigger pieces of velcro for more sticking power. Cutting board is nice.
5,"Fun, high quality fruit/vegetable cutting set","My 20 month old daughter loves cutting her fruits and vegetables! The velcro does a good job holding the two halves in shape, and there's a nice slicing sound as the knife cuts through the velcro. The wood and paint are good quality. There are a few things they could do better, IMO, such as making the banana slicable and the cutting board completely flat rather than with rounded edges, but overall this is a great toy that I would buy again."
3,Velcro wears out quickly,"My 2 year old daughter received this as a gift. She loves the bright colors and that she is able to ""cut"" the fruits and vegetables. I love wooden, non-toxic, and durable toys that offer imaginative play. The down side to this particular ""cutting"" set is that the velcro, which sticks the two pieces of vegetable or fruit together, wears very quickly. In a matter of months, withstanding moderate play, our fruits and veggies don't stick together very well anymore."
3,"smaller than expected, not everything cuts","We can't complain other than they were smaller than we were expecting. I have a mini set from the same company, and its larger, and has alot of neat details. This kit has some things like the banana and the mushroom that don't cut open. Needless to say my almost 2 year old had no complaints with the toy, and played for most of the afternoon."
5,LOOKS YUMMY ENOUGH TO EAT!!!!,This set is as real looking as it gets! Kids love it and play with them and pretend to eat.
4,Smaller than expected,"Nice quality but I was hoping for larger sized pieces of fruits and veggies, something more realistic. We may still keep them because they were not that expensive."
3,ok,"I love that these toys are chemically safer for my child. They are really small, though. If only they were a bit bigger, more life size, I think my daughter would like them more. The banana is so small..."
4,"safe ""slicing""fun for little ones",nicely made wooden fruits and veggies for pretend cooking and passively teaches healthy food choices through play
3,not for young toddlers,"I loved the idea, but the pieces for this toy are too small for young toddlers as they present a choking hazard, especially if your kids are still always putting things in their mouth like mine. This is disappointing as I think think they could have easily made the pieces bigger and more realistic. Melissa and Doug have done it right!"
3,3 stars is...........,"the best i can rate this one. while its a decent read if your looking for what its like to walk the AT, the author too often strays off to quoting others, his problems at home etc."
3,Would have liked a little less self-involvement,"I was embarrassed for Mrs. Rubin, whose husband told the whole world that he was not very happy with their marriage. He also was not happy in his work (ahh...poor baby!), which we heard about at length. Otherwise, this was a ""fact book"" about the AT.If you want to read one really great book about the AT, read Bryson's book. This one is just so-so."
5,A Thought Provoking Book,After the second chapter I wanted to strap on a pack and conquer the trail myself. And the book only got better.
3,Thru-hiker's Success Story,"I'm a thru-hiker wanna-be, so I've read several of these journals - some better and many worse. The thing that stands out to me in Rubin's book is the way he grows from a whining, irritable hiker in the south, to a thru-hiker that is truly wrapped up in the wonder of the AT at the end. He also has real-life problems that linger in the back of his mind: home responsibilities (with the matching set of guilt complexes) and a job that sucks, but he still manages to complete the pilgrimage which is no small feat. Not funny like Bryson or technical like some of the others, but interesting."
1,This is a bunch of bs,"i bought this to dye my hair (also because i was told this is better for darker hair) and each time i tried to color it..this washed right out (i tried 2x but bought 3)! First off, my stylist told me i shouldnt have to bleach my hair in order to see the color...not true...this for dark hair only product is just terrible...not only will i never buy it again..im trying to get my money back for the last box...unfortunately im still stuck with my brown hair (which i have been able to easily dye before)"
4,the dopest mc's from the 'hood,"yo, yo, yo hommiez! the dopest mc's from the hood are back to bring you the freshest collection of songs about icing suckaz ever assembled. most of the songs are about killing suckaz and drinking 40's, which is why I relate to this record so much..."
2,Not Scientific,"This book is fun and educational if you are interested in performing a DEMONSTRATION regarding a scientific concept. The examples have nothing to do with conducting an EXPERIMENT that one would present at a Science Fair. The ""problems"" listed for each example can be answered by opening an encyclopia. Generally a problem/question that begins with the word, ""how"" can be answered in such a way. The purpose of a science fair is to conduct ORIGINAL experiments involving an experimental group and a control group. There are other guide books on the market that take a more scientific approach and steer the student in the right direction."
1,"Terrible, These are NOT the ""Best"" Science Fair Projects!","I picked up this book for my son in 6th grade after reading so many glorifying reviews about Van Cleave's books and the fact that she has so many books out there. Boy were we ever disappointed! These are not ""science fair projects"" that a student can use for doing a science fair project in grades 5 and up, rather, they are trite projects for little grade school children or kindergarteners. How can a project that asks the question ""what are the parts of a fingernail"" and for materials required lists only a magnifying glass for the so-called experiment which is consists of a student holding the magnifying glass over his/her fingernail to observe, how can this possibly be a ""best"" science fair project? How can this be any science fair project at all? Where is the hypothesis, what is the real experiment, how could a student enter this in a science fair? Don't waste your time with this one, I returned it for a refund."
3,Something to Think About Before Purchasing,"I'll start by saying the seller packaged this light fixture very well; the original fixture box was placed inside a shipping box with sufficient padding. While the shipping box suffered a bit in transit, the original box and fixture were perfect. Shipping was fast, and I would not hesitate to order from this seller again.The only reason I purchased this fixture is because someone took the cover (diffuser) to my existing fixture. While the Sea Gull website lists the replacement cover on its website (as do dozens of other websites), it has been discontinued and is completely out of stock (this information is direct from a Sea Gull representative and possibly why someone felt the need to take my cover).Prior to purchasing this fixture, just keep in mind that you will not be able to buy a replacement cover. If you break or lose your cover, they only option you will have is to buy the fixture again."
5,Valuable Information on Every Aspect of Beauty,"Here it is, finally in one place. Everything you ever wanted to know about hair, makeup, fashion, celebrities, all in this one great book. From the latest beauty supplements to 2 day emergency diets that the stars use, 911 Beauty Secrets covers it. Many of the beauty solutions can be made at home or bought inexpensively from the grocery or drugstore. Diane Irons simplifies beauty so that we ALL can get there. If you're sick and tired of those ""coffee table"" beauty books and need some practical solutions, at last it's here. I highly recommend it."
2,Lacking in Clarity,"On page 40, Diane says to ""Slough off dead skin cells with a solution made of sea salt and lemon,"" but she doesn't offer the proportions for each ingredient. This kind of problem is present throughout the book. It's great to read some of the techniques she offers, but it doesn't do a lot of good when she doesn't explain everything we need to know about their application. It would have been more helpful if the author had included an appendix of ""recipes"" for the solutions she offers."
2,Some of her advice is actually UNSAFE,"I did find a couple good tidbits, but most of her advice was cliched and simplistic. Some of it was downright silly... ""never chew gum, never drink from a straw"". Come on now, who really is going to abide by this? She also advocates temporary anorexia for those who want to ""crash diet"" which she doesn't consider ""very bad"". Ask any doctor and he/she will tell you that it is unsafe and unhealthy. Mrs. Irons needs to think twice before she gives people advice on how to starve themselves."
1,i gave my copy away,This beauty book is not very good. The advice is very dated and the writing is not engaging. Save your money and pass on this one.
1,Excellent idea for a book...if the stuff in here actually worked!,"I was very excited to hear about this great book that has all these fabulous home fixes to our everyday beauty problems as women. I became very disappointed when all the fixes I tried DID NOT work for me. I feel like it was a total waste of my money.Perhaps I gave up too quickly, but I do not have any idea where I put my copy of this book since I found it useless. I got more good real working advice from this little cheap book I bought from a bargain bin called Natural Beauty or something. It really is too bad since I love all grandmother homemade beauty recipes and fixes, but Diane Irons just does not work for me."
3,Common sense mostly,This book is pretty basic common sense. Especially in terms of the advice on how to dress: ie. don't wear midriffs to the office on casual Fridays or torn jeans. Duh. But some of the makeup tips are useful. Overall it is an average book filled with common sense and anyone with a bit of fashion savvy doesn't need it.
2,"Okay, but not what I expected","I purchased this book to get specific instructions on diminishing those horrible lip lines we develop as we get older. Why? Because the author talked about the miracle of boric acid and lemon juice throughout her latest publicity tour.GUESS WHAT! There is NO MENTION of boric acid for this purpose in the entire book. NOTHING AT ALL on reducing the appearance of lip lines. I was duped.As for the rest of the information, there were one or two novelties, but most is what we've heard before."
3,"Some good, some bad, some the same-old-same-old!","I have been reading GLAMOUR for years and most of the secrets have popped up at one time or another. I'm not saying that it's not great to have them all in one place, but most of this is old news. I will use it and it's pretty good."
5,This is a wonderful book!!!!,"Please, I am visually handicapped and desperately need an audio version. Is ther one available, please? I would be very grateful for anything that you could do to help me obtain this. Thank You."
1,Talks of Love but fails to define it,The book was content free. I found the Introduction and Forward to be enjoyable reading but after that the rest of the book was tedious and failed to provide me any idea what love is or how one goes about growing their own love. I will now have to look elsewhere in my quest to understand what is love...
1,Hard to believe David Weber wrote it.,"David Weber is my favorite author. As I read Apocolypse Troll I was stunned. A poor, overworked plot, undeveloped characters and action that was incomplete and not intense. In short, it had none of the features I have come to expect from David Weber. I have to believe that this book was either released in sketch form without Weber's permission, or that it is an old work that the publisher dusted off and printed without giving Weber a chance to finish or re-write it."
3,The Apocalypse Read,"This is my 1st time out reading David Weber. I have not had the honor to read any of the Honor Harrington novels, although my friend tells me they are on the ""must-read"" list. Apocalypse Troll starts off promising, but quickly falls into a semi predictable fish-out of water story mixed with Robin Cook's: Invasion storyline. The characters were put togher haphazardly and didn't command much from my attention as well as feelings. The book is good for a light read and I wouldn't rate it high on my reading list."
3,"Very good story, page turner - with flaws","I picked this up at Borders, and got involved. Like the guy says below, it's not a bodice-ripper. It's a military sci-fi story, and it's quite good. It's got his usual clearly monstrous bad-guy critter(s) that nobody would have any problem killing.Like much of Weber's stuff, he has excellent battle scenes, and as long as the scene makes sense as a decision that seems reasonable, it's great. Only thing is, that at critical points it doesn't seem reasonable. The final battle scene - well - given the setup, it would have been handled differently. Wouldn't have been an infantry battle. Would have been 1, maybe 10 nuclear missiles instead. I just can't believe anyone would make that decision, because of the risk.But it's a good story. I'm just a stickler for authenticity of details at all levels."
3,"A good read, but not Weber's best","A bit predictable, but good action, some interesting ideas. I liked the characters, and I'll probably read it again.I'd check this one out of the library before buying it, if I were you.If you want Weber at his best, read On Basilisk Station."
3,"Not bad, not original, but not bad...","Another fairly solid book by Mr. Weber. The plot to this book is not original by any means, but for what its worth, it is a well written and entertaining little novel. I always like David Weber's ability to create a detailed universe and this novel is no exception. However, if you are looking for a more original plot, stick with his Honor Harrington series, because this book recycles plot elements seen in numerous other sci-fi books. So, if you are looking for a light read, this book should fit...if you're looking for something to stimulate the mind, skip to something else."
3,A good read from one of the Best in modern SF,"The Apocalypse Troll by David Weber is yet another feather in his cap. The story revolves around a fighter pilot from the far future who is flung back in time during a space battle and is rescued by a modern day man. The Fighter Pilot explains to her rescuer that she is from the future and that one of the aliens she was fighting is now loose on the planet.Together they begin to organize and notify various governments and orgainzations to find and destroy the alien. Mr. Weber works into this work of SF current events and trends such as the growing dissatisfaction between the races in America, the instability of the Russians, the animosity of the Argetines and England and more.Though not indepth enough to make one believe that it could truly happen, the interactions are far from totally unbelievable. Not one of his best works but far from boring I would say that this book is a good read."
5,A Darn good story!!,"David Weber does it again! A great read that I couldn't put down! A warning from the future about a enemy who wants nothing more than to destroy all of humanity and a chance turn the tables. But first there is a killing machine lose on earth that must be destroyed. If humanity fails there will be no chance for the stars, victory will bring a wonderous collection of technology from the future and the chance for humanity jump into the star with a technologal edge that will make them unstopable! David Weber once again desplay's his superior writing talent. The author is one of the few who can make all the technology in his imagination come to life in terms that are clear, exciting and don't bore the reader to tears. Definately worth reading if your a David Weber fan!"
4,"Fast action, quick read, holds your interest","Here's a story with a unique twist - ""human"" aliens so to speak. It's a fun story with characters you'll like. The opening grabs your interest and it's a fast ride from there to an exciting conclusion. This is the first of Weber's books I've read and I'll certainly try another one."
5,GREAT novel,"This is a great novel. The characters are as believable as science fiction can have. Though it takes place in the present, the novel explores time travel with legitimate alternatives."
4,Good Read,"Its refreshing to come across a good sci-fi with all the elements of adventure. Written with an almost Tom Clancy style, this book is worth the paperback price."
3,"A competent enough work, but lacking his later flair.","As you may know, ""Apocalypse Troll"" is actually an older work by David Weber, which is being released for the first time now. While an engaging read, it's not quite as good as his later book, with characterization of the Troll being even sketchier then usual for a villain. Over all, not bad but I wouldn't want for somebody to get introduced to DW with this."
2,Ever seen The Fifth Element?,"I still have a hard time believing David Weber, who's been responsible for so many books I enjoyed, wrote this book. The plot is lifted directly from Luc Besson's The Fifth Element. The name of the main female character is even taken from the lead actress in the film.I generally don't mind finding a lifted plot or character. I've read excellent rewrites of the Odyssey, The Brother Karamazov, and Les Miserables over the years. For that matter, Weber borrowed liberally from Forrester's Hornblower and the history of Nelson to create his Honor Harrington series. Unfortunately, this was poorly done. If you catch the plot similarities in the first few chapters, you'll know everything else before it happens."
2,A male fantasy at best,"Hmmmm..., let's see. There's this warrior guy in our world, minding his own business, when (gasp!) all of a sudden, futuristic warships appear and blow the stuffing out of each other. A supersmart, super beautiful, youthful woman (who also happens to be superhuman and a great warrior) is rescued by the said warrior man (Boy meets girl.) I'm sure many of us young men have had the above fantasy at least once. For one thing, Weber already did this kind of story in Mutineer's Moon and to a lesser rate, at Heirs of the Empire. This stuff is so old it's stale."
5,Excellent Book!,"I just finished reading this book tonight. With it's intriguing intro, it was hard to imagine what a treat it really was. Perhaps the main thing that contributes to this story, is that once it moves into a near future timeline, the plot is very very believable.And the barbs at the wackos on both sides of the poltical aisle were great!The characterization was good and the plot was pretty tight. Unfortunately, this book has left it wide open to be carried on, so now I'm dying to see where this one goes. So what really is going to happen when a prepared humanity meets the Kangas now???I have read virtually everything by DW to date and haven't been disappointed yet."
5,"A Vastly Underrated Novel, Overshadowed by Honor Harrington Series","I should've reviewed this book years ago. It is an outstanding novel that would probably make a great movie. Unfortunately it has been largely overshadowed by Weber's subsequent Honor Harrington series. Much of the technology that is common in the Honorverse books and the strong female lead character are foreshadowed here.The portions where the human woman (well, mostly human) is introduced to the major governments on Earth (secretly and not including the Chinese) is handled extremely well and realistically with our heroine having to use a vast amount of her ""phaser like"" hand weapons charge to prove her claims.And the portions where the ""troll"" (the ""apocalypse troll"" of the title) gains control of the minds of humans, especially the minds of those in various racist hate groups in the U.S., is quite chilling and effective.The final page of the book leaves the reader both saddened yet fullfilled in a way that the best stories should."
4,Enjoyable Fast Paced Sci-fi,"This is one of Weber's tighter novels. It stays on plot, on track, and doesn't have excessive viewpoints. The confrontations are entertaining, and the amount of military terminology was exactly right.It's an enthralling read without any big lessons or morals, and I recommend it if you enjoy military science fiction. The protagonists are good human military officers, and the antagonists are evil aliens. Has time-travel, space battles, and alternative geo-political history.If you like Weber, you'll like this."
3,Just for the record,its seems to this viewer that Wagner's opera house recorded this performance of the second of the Ring Operas to have an historical record of the production and to provide a memory device as to the main principles of the cast. There are so many better versions on disc that I would recommend for the collector only
1,Pre-teen fodder,The review below pretty much sums up my opinion as well. Seeing Retard O Bot live was so lame it hurt. Prolly the worst band to come out of the Florida scene next to Deadstar Assembly.
3,"Good ideas, terrible conceprtion","I am not quite sure, but I think this was put out on Herbie Mann's label, which was issued by Atlantic, when he was a big shot there.Whatever. This album contains some very interesting soul pieces, some experimentarl rock jams, and some out and out electronic experiments. Most of these are decent enough to at least get your attention.But they are lined up on the album in an order I cannot understand. The album hops from one idea to the other, with no common thread. Just when your getting into one mood, your whipsawed to another. Everything comes across as half-baked.This was the downside of the late 60s. Everybody thought they could mix a bunch of styles and they would have Sgt. Pepper. The result was a lot of dreck.Circles is good as a curiosity, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get."
2,I dont like this toy,I am sorry we purchased this toy for my 4 year old. She does not have the strength or patience to push each of the pieces of yarn through the rubber board. She was not interested.
4,Good product and fast service.,The product was exactly how it was described and arrive really quickly.I recommend this product to any parents who would like to get something that'd help enhance kids' creative mind.
3,Lots of fun,"This is a great toy which is easy to use. It works for kids of various ages.No batteries, no noise, and it takes a mild beating without too much difficulty."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap....","I loved the size and shape perfect for 1.5-2 lb of pasta. I was a concerned about how lightweight and flimsy the metal seemed when it arrived. It has already started showing signs of rusting on the bottom after only 2 months of use. Stainless steel should not be rusting in 2 months. I do put it in the dishwasher along with my stainless steel pots, which do not rust. Guess the old saying goes, ""You get what you pay for."""
3,Over the top,"I am very familiar with ""pir"" culture and grew up in same region as discussed in this book and I understand that this is word of fiction but still this is way over the top. Yes these so called holy men are taking advantage of poor uneducated masses but still is it to this degree I am not sure ."
5,An excellent systematic approach to managing kids behavior.,"As a marriage and family therapist, I'm always looking for books to recommend to my clients. This book helps parents manage difficult children with a great system that has some very important concepts. For instance, you are given ideas on how to help your child develop self-control. I recommend it all the time!"
2,Coffee cup and saucer,Not expected to be so small.very disappointed....not normal coffee cup size.the size half the size of a standard size...should write in description smaller the normal size cup
3,Reaction from a 3 yr old,"Our grandson liked the book, but did not like the music. I was very surprised, as he generally loves all kinds of music."
5,Super detailed map of Louisiana back roads,"This book is a necessary tool for researchers of local or family history. The scale is 1""=25 miles so you get incredible details of small roads, cemeteries and other structures. Names of small communities and physical features are listed. The areas are easy to locate by checking a map of the state as a whole (located in two places in the book). And the book is a convenient size to throw in the car for an adventurous road trip (the pages are glossy paper and easy to clean). I find I frequently give ""The Roads of Louisiana"" as a gift to friends who like to explore the back roads as much as I do."
4,'L' Hook not so useful,"I agree with one of the other reviewers - I find little use for the 'L' hooks. The product image shows a bunch of wrenches hanging from it, but who in their right mind wants to remove three wrenches to get at the one they want? I would much rather order an 8-pack of 'S' hooks. Gladiator should rethink their packaging.Other than that, the product quality is great, although I find these hooks to be rather easy to knock out of the GearWall track if they are mounted high and you are trying to slide an object with a 'hanging hole' over the hanger (especially the L hook, with its rubberized coating). Also, the bottom lip could be a tad longer, especially if you are trying to span two GearWall panels. If you leave any bit of gap between the panels, these hooks will have trouble locking in (and it's almost impossible not to leave a tiny gap somewhere on these panels)."
2,Stupid Packaging,"I like Gladiator GarageWorks stuff, but I don't like that the company chose to package these two types of hooks together. The J hooks are much more useful, and I have many more unused L hooks lying around."
4,Can find uses for BOTH hook types,"Some users complain there isn't much use for the L-hooks. I would disagree, and if you have a bunch of extra laying around unused, feel free to send them my way :-) I use the L-hooks for holding a couple of things, like extension cords and some tools that are too thick to hang on the J-hooks (e.g. clamps). I also have a few lined up on the wall to hold longer pole type items. The angled tip keeps them from rolling off.The only reason I took a star off was for the price. In fact, I only buy gladiator stuff when it's on sale. The regular price is way too costly!"
2,Rubber coating a little thick.,"The J-hook hanger works well for shallow tools, like a crescent wrench or box end wrenches. The L-hook is functional for items that have a moderately large haning hole. However, the L-hook doesn't work well for smallish holes that the J-hook would work for, the covering on the L-hook is too thick and more like a foam than a plastic coating(the kind you get on Channel Lock brand pliers). The thicker, tacky coating on the L-hook limits the kind of tools it will hold. If you pull a tool off to quickly the tackiness can cause the hook to come off the gear track/wall."
4,Assault on Ul-Drakken,"A Drow priestess and head of the house of Vrama wishes to unite the Drow people in a war against the surface world and the pcs are just the pawns neccessary to make this happen. Queen Of Lies is an adventure for 11th level players and takes place in the underdark. Includes a Drow fortress, new magic items & monsters."
4,"Berkeley is not his best, but really good","The gem of this video is ""Hey Baby Land of the New Rising Sun"". The reason this does not get 5 stars is the idiots who filmed this. Jimi's playing is awesome as always, but the camera work is too big of a distraction on ""Hear My Train a comin'"" & on ""Machine Gun"". Shaking the samera for effect, showing Jimi sideways on the screen...what is that all about? Sorry to dwell on the negative, but other than those minor points, this is a great video."
3,cut or uncut,"the vhs does not give the minutes. i bought this tape around 7 years ago because i new it was his best live performance on film next to monteray pop, but i was disapointed when i played the tape because a lot of songs were cut. i mean the middle of these songs were cut out and it was such good guitar playing. if you have hendrix in the west you know what i mean or one song on rainbow bridge. the tape i bought runs about an hour and is cut up. i did see this tape somewhere else and it ran for a lot longer like 1 and 3 quarter hours or something like that. mabey its the uncut verson"
5,Jimi at his best,"OK, the production of this video is not on par with Lord of the Rings. But I'm giving it 5 stars because (IMHO) it is the best footage of Jimi Hendrix in existence. At Woodstock, Jimi looked tired and short tempered. At Berkeley, he really seemed to be having a great time - laughing, cavorting with kids in the audience, and playing at his absolute best. Berkeley was Jimi's home town, and he really gave this concert his all. So the video gets about 3 stars, but Jimi gets 5, only because I can't give him 10!"
3,I feel slightly cheated,"This dvd could've been sooo great. From the different clips i've seen, this was a great show. the problem is.. the length of the footage from this dvd almost equals footage shown on other films. the way this show is butchered makes it seem like jimi came on, ran thru three songs for each show and left. the actual footage, with the performance, interviews, protest footage and other random stuff is a whopping 45 min.... yes 45 min.on the bright side, jimi, mitch and billy play brilliantly for the short time they're shown. Also, the audio for the entire second show is included. hopefully one day, they'll release footage of at least one of the entire shows ala woodstock, blue wild angel and band of gypsies. films that truly illustrated why jimi was one of the greatest of our time"
2,Butchered,"This DVD is not complete,several of the tracks have been grossly butchered.I don't remember the original movie beingthis hacked up,whether the missing pieces were poor qualityor not I think most of Us would prefer having poor qualityvideo segments rather than none at all.Also in the original movie there is a scene in the limo where Jimi takes a drag off of a joint ,that has been cut out,is this an attempt to manipulate Jimi's posthumous image?If so I think it sucks!The original movie presented things as they were and shouldhave been left as such in its transfer to DVD."
3,Jimi is great ....,"....but whoever allowed this to be released in the butchered state that it's in should be shot!!!! I have waited for this complete show/movie to come out with good sound and uncut now for so many years, when I found out that they did this to it, my jaws just droped.... I will buy it but I am so angry that some of his best playing has actually been cut out.... Get your act together ""the people who are in charge of Jimi's music"" please, you are doing him a great diservice..... If Jimi was alive he would be doing the shooting himself....Enough said but the dvd is still worth it because of the 5.1 and stereo sound remastering.....(if it was not cut i would have given it a 5)...Buy it anyway it's still worth it...""Purple Haze"" ""Johnny B Goode"" and what is left of ""Hear my Train A Comin"" alone are invaluable...ROCK ON JIMI (the undisputable master!!!!)"
1,"The video is horrible, the music is great",The music is inspired but the camera work was done by a LSD-soaked reject who had no skill. Warning: Buy this ONLY as an audio source because the video SUCKS. I want you to know that I am a huge Hendrix fan and I have voraciously consumed his catalogue and enjoyed it for what it is: the work of a genius with a guitar who turned the world on its head with his incredible talent and pioneering creations. Buy something else: Woodstock!
4,"3 stars for the video, 5 stars for the music","In the end, while we all want to SEE Hendrix play, it is just as enjoyable to sit back and let Jimi's guitar take us away. There is some really inspired playing here. The presence of the audio version makes it worthwhile. Good stuff for Hendrix fans."
2,2003 edition re-released?,"If you have the 2003 DVD release, save your money. Nothing here to justify a ""re-release"" with different packaging and BS promises of ""never-before seen"" footage. I foolishly believed the hype...all the songs are on the 2003 disc..."
3,I would like a uncut version on Blu - Ray,Hear my train comin. I listen to this a million times so when he startedplaying this I was so excited to watch it be performed. Well the first solois cut down but second solo was completely cut out I had to turn it off
5,Jimi tears it up!!!,"This is an awesome jimi concert, the set list is great and jimi preforms it well. This dvd should be in the hands of every true Jimi fan and if its not, you shouldnt call yourself a fan of Jimi Hendrix. The video quality is o.k but its the best your going to be able to get from concert footage from the late 60's.Jimi is great although he is so wasted that he often forgets the words or skips verses. But hey, he aint known for his singing!!!"
4,I was there,"I got this DVD mostly to remember the night I got to see Jimi Hendrix, live. I went to the second show that night in Berkeley with a buddy, we were seniors in high school. After all these years, it's interesting to compare the film to my memories of the event. My memory bank seems to have embellished that evening with more color, more electricity, and verve than the DVD seems to show. ( and, no, I wasn't on any sort of potion that night,... I was as straight as can be),... I suppose for those who were not there, this would be pretty interesting, but for me, it's a bit of a comedown. I guess they cut some of the concert out of the film,...... I understand that,..... but, I just had higher expectations for the film based upon my memory of that evening,.......Still, nice to have that bit of history documented."
3,an OK movie,"This movie is really pretty typical. A family gets terrorized by bad guys. A lot of people get shot or have their heads bashed in. It's nothing that hasn't been done before. It probably only deserves about 2 stars, but I gave it an extra one because I like Christopher Lambert. The movie isn't bad though. If you don't mind a lot of violence in movies, then it's worth watching."
1,"Horrible movie, horrible scripts, or horrible acting? I can't decide...","Honestly, I really can't decide if it was one or the other, or simply all of the above. It was bad! I like Craig Sheffer as an actor, which is the reason I wanted to see this film, but it was a disappointment! Pretty weird.....especially the part where the evil brother stopped his brother Cliff from killing the father of the family they've been trying to hunt down that whole time!! The reason for this was...""you're lucky I like you!?!?!?"" OK, they've been chasing this dude down like madmen from hell, now one of them stops his brother from killing him because he likes him? Then they ride off with his daughter, while the father tries to chase them down in a car, and they try to shoot at him on the road. If I were Craig Sheffer and Christopher Lambert, I wouldn't use this one on my resume."
3,"Fascinating, informative perspective","this book is written by the man who orchestrated much of the defense against the bombing attacks on Germany during the latter part of the war. Unfortunately, as an autobiography, it presents with a limited and skewed perspective of the big picture. For example, author repeatedly refers in the belief that earlier embrace of miracle weapons such as guided missles would have turned the tide. However, it is likely that many of them had serious operational deficiencies that would have rendered them expensive and ineffective. For example, unmanned guided motor boats loaded with explosives were available to the german navy but had precious little success, and usually resulted in the remote human operators being hunted down and wiped out."
2,TYpical German biography,"Hermann, one of the more nazi of the nazis in Luftwaffe, was a controversial character, and decided to write this book to make the truth clear. But he writes in a heavy language, that makes the reading unpleasant and totally boring. Anyway, as a major figure in Luftwaffe, he deserves credit for the book."
2,Not What I Expected,I didn't realize this is simply a taping of a live event. This is not what was advertised and he simply didn't deliver much of any value. Simply seems like a way to generate revenue from another product. Thin on content and value for me. I returned the DVD.
4,wrong item sent - but full money refund:),"I ordered a 3 book set and when it arrived, 2 of the books were wrong. I emailed them, and about a week later, they responed. They were very nice and explained that they were out of the item, gave me a FULL money refund and said I could keep the books that came. So even though I did not get what I orderd, things worked out in the end...I guess."
4,Another protest.,"As the author of Death of Gods I wish to protest the inclusion of quite a few titles that my book is said to have cited. I have long struggled against being associated with certain ideas, and although I do not know these books, they are certainly ones that I did not consult. They are: Egyptian Pyramids by E. Longley, The Aztecs by P. Ardagh, Ancient Egypt, by V. Parker, Ancient Egypt by Boase, The Middle Kingdom, by Williams, Ms. Frizzle' Adventures by Cole, Book of the Dead by Russell, Book of the Dead by Preston,and History of the World by Carter. A new edition of Death of Gods will soon be available in a new size (6X9)and a new price.The Death of Gods in Ancient Egypt"
5,"Merengue from the Puerto Rican Queen, ASHLEY","Ashley strings spanish verse to the booming sounds of the greatest Puerto Rican merengue. ""Ese moreno"" and ""Yo soy la bomba"" are the highlights of this stellar rookie album by Ashley."
3,LA CHICA BOMBA!!!,"Ashley es una muy buena interprete del merengue bomba. Este es su primer trabajo para Sony Tropical y fue producido por el talentoso Guillermo Torres que ha trabajado con artistas de la talla de Lourdes Robles y Rawy, y quien trabaja como director del Grupo Kaos. Este disco esta lleno de sabor, ritmo y mucho merengue. Los temas mas exitosos del disco lo son ""El Truco"", ""Yo Soy La Bomba"", ""Yo Tengo Un Ritmo"" y ""Ese Moreno"". Si te gusta el merengue tambien te recomiendo los siguientes discos: ""Pasional"" de Jessica Cristina, ""En Vivo"" de Manny Manuel, ""Caminando"" de Tonny Tun Tun, ""Natural"" de Jessica, ""Maria Alejandra"" de Maria Alejandra y ""Ni Es Lo Mismo, Ni Es Igual"" de Juan Luis Guerra."
2,Lasted for a little while...,This camera was good for me but I just wish it lasted for a longer period of time. I had to repair it once and then it broke again so now I have no camera to use.
2,Frustrating camera,"I bought this camera about 1 1/2 years ago, and I'm having to send it to the shop for the second time with the same problem. It freezes, and replacing the battery doesn't unfreeze it, so off to repair it goes. The first time, the shop suggested that it was because I didn't use Sony nickel-hydride rechargeable batteries. Happened the second time using those batteries, so it's is apparently a bigger problem than that. My old Kodak and my friends' other brands of digital camera haven't been in the shop once. I would not buy this product again."
2,speak up for once,"This is less of a review and more a one note filter of this pseudodocudrama.After a few tens of minutes on PBS, the voicing of Mileva in a constant whispering was just too aggravating. I guess somebody decided that to create the subtext of Mileva standing in the shadow of Einstein's shoulder, whispering the secrets of the universe in his ear, she had to be whispering at all times. If overdone things like Ken Burns' violins get on your nerves, maybe this will too."
2,How to coach Tee Ball with out going INSANE,This book is a good book for older kids playing Tee ball. I am coaching a YMCA league comprised of 3 and 4 year olds. If you are coaching little guys/gals - I would recommend videos more than books.
5,good product,This is very good condoms. It doesn't irritate as many others do. And very economical pack. :) I realy advice it!
1,beware!,Got this package in a plastic bag instead of original package! Very disappointed. The condoms are made in India! I don't trust this seller!
1,Breaking Condoms!!!,I bought these condoms and I had trouble with them breaking! They came in a ziplock baggy. I had trouble getting down on my johnson was the first thing I noticed. I don't have a large or long cock but I'm not small either. So once I got the things on they broke! So I don't recommend these at all!!!
1,Weak,"It feels like nothing but it's really weak. If you stay less than 5 sec this might work ( lol ) because in the first 10 sec this things will break. This stuff is useless, the condoms are breaking 2 times over 3 use, and believe me, I know how to put a condom on. I just trow them away."
1,Unreliable,"When I ordered from them 6 months ago, I got a large zip-lock bag of 94 condoms, and they were all well within the expiration date. A few condoms short, but otherwise okay.HOWEVER, when I ordered from them last month, the package that showed up was a box of 24 condoms. I immediately contacted them, but didn't get a reply. Subsequent attempts have also failed, so I guess I just paid $30 for 24 condoms. :("
5,"Great price, but not retail box","This is a great price -- cheaper than any I have seen. However, I was a little surprised that it was not retail boxed. Just individual units (Durex sealed package) stuffed into a big envelope."
4,Rather fragile,"These are EXTRA thin for super sensitivity, making them a bit fragile. They do meet our need when handled carefully. These were VERY inexpensive, loose packed, but we got short changed by two condoms. Still a value, but I do not like being shipped short.... Not worth complaining to the vendor, but they need to take more care counting..."
5,Good product !,I bought 100 pack from Potential Dynamix LLC (Seller).The product quality is great. I got it for an amazing price.
1,Condoms,"This would be a really great deal if they weren't 2 years out of date.I recieved this packageon Tuesday October 12,2010 and they had an expiration date of September of 2008."
1,Sketchy at best,"Just received that ""100"" pack, and it's just a bunch of loose condoms in a bubble envelope. It's sketchy, and I'm not even sure I'd trust using them. It says nowhere in the description that it won't come in factory sealed boxes, so I'll probably end up throwing them in the garbage. Not worth risking an STD or pregnancy over $12."
3,Poor package.,Seller just put 100 items into a bubble envelope. I do not feel good because that looks low end and unsafe.
1,"it should say ""almost 100 condoms""","there were only 92 condoms, no big deal but I paid for 100. Also, they break very easy, they are not safe!"
5,heck yeah!,Best DONG BAGS EVER. use this in accordance with the product below for immediate results.How to Make Someone Fall in Love With You in 90 Minutes or Less
5,Nice tool,"Very well made tool and worth every penny of the price. if you've tried to remove ferrules with the $10.00 home center tools this will be a pleasant surprise. I""m not a plumber but need a puller 3 or 4 times a year. When my latest home center puller broke I did a web search and found the Pasco 4461. There were other pullers that looked ot be good tools but they were almost double the money. I can't imagine they could be any more well built than this one."
4,Good Piece of Gear,"I just finished sheetrocking my home office - mostly by myself - plus a little help from the wife. As I was ordering equipment for the job, I saw the Free hands Drywall Supports and thought, ""What the heck"" and ordered a set (they come 2 to a pack).Now that I am through the job, I must say they came in quite handy. Good stuff. You are able to screw them into the studs and they are able to hold up sheets of sheetrock while you drill them in. I found that I was easily able to hang most of the sheets myself. A very simple device - but very helpful. Money well spent if you are contemplating a one person sheetrock job."
3,Needs an editor with common sense,"The latest Aunt Dimity outing was pleasant, if not particularly substantial. But there's one thing that doesn't make sense...in this or any of the books. If I'm not mistaken, Lori is supposed to be in her mid-30s. Yet her mother and Aunt Dimity met when they were both volunteers during World War II. If the books are set in the present, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense unless Lori was born at least 20 years after the end of the war. It's not *impossible*...but it certainly is a stretch...Or have I forgottedn something from one of the earlier books."
4,"""Casparetta"" the friendly ghost","This is another in a series of highly improbable stories that have a strange fascination for me. While I am not completely averse to sex and gore, it is a pleasure to read about resolving problems with the assistance of a charming other-worldly ghost. I have read all of Nancy Atherton's ""Aunt Dimity"" books several times over, and they continue to be enjoyable, even though I do not fully understand their fascination. I look forward to reading the latest book, due out this month."
4,A GOOD BOOK,"This was a good book. Don't listen to those reviews that say it was bad. It was a little nrealistic at points, but you should read it and see what you think for yourself. Anyway, I loved this book and my opinion is that it was really good. So, if you haven't read it, read it!"
5,This was an intresting really cool book!,I loved this book! I had to buy it twice because I was halfway through it and I lost it but it was well worth my money... I loved the mystery of the reincarnation in this book. Imagine! Theodore is Damon and Flore is Lila. It is totally romantic and still manages to send a shiver up my spine!
2,This was not by far the best SVU book published.,"I really did not enjoy this book. I could definately put it down. It was put down so long that I waited for the next two books to come out and read before I finished it. It just didn't have the funky spirit as the others have. I thought it was very slow moving, not too interesting. Don't really care about Lila. By the way what happened to Bruce?? Is it me or do alot of boyfriends disappear from time to time during each book??? Seems there is a lot of cheating going on here for a teenage book."
1,Disappointing,This version of Hillerman just doesn't recreate the book's story for me. The actors are not putting out much effort and they are too obviously not Navajo.
4,"A great mixture of intrigue, and comedy by Phillips.","Dark Wind is an interesting tale of a young Navajo police officer wanting to become a healer. The story is full of intrigue and gives the watcher a small viewpoint of native culture blended with the present. Lou Diamond Phillips shows us a comedian side we rarely see, he is actually quite funny in places. Though it is not one of his best films, it is certainly worth watching. I liked it enough to purchase the video, and all of my family enjoy watching it. It's a great movie. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Lou Diamond Phillips, or movies pertaining to Native Americans."
4,Truest to form,"I am a long time hillerman fan and waited anxiously for his movies. I have seen all of them and this is the truest to the hillerman ""feel"". Usually the movie is not as good as the book and this is true of all the movies. It is because the magic of the books is not the plots but the ""color"" which is difficult to transfer to film. Lou Diamond Phillips is Chee. He is better than Adam Beach. If you are a Hillerman fan then this is the best. The later ones are good but have been hollywooded up a notch."
4,Review of The Dark Wind,"If you're a big Hillerman fan, you will enjoy this. It is the first of Hillerman's books that was made into a movie. Not as well made as the newer ones done for PBS, but still worth watching. Follows the book closely."
2,wish it wasn't so,"Like some Hillerman type excitement and entertainment? Keep wishing...Seeing Robert Redford's name in the credits of what might pass for a high school film class production is quite a disappointment, but then, if it didn't make the theaters I guess you shouldn't expect much from the cartoon-like characters.The story has no explanation for the two suitcases of cocaine that suddenly appear in Che's truck at the end. You'll have to read the book to figure that out.Watch for the boom mike overhead on camera, unedited, in the climatic ending scene."
2,not durable,"It worked ok for the first few days after we got it for our dog to play and walk in the snow and on the pavement with snow/salt.We realized that these boots are extremely hard to clean by hand. The salt and sand get stuck on the bottom of the boots because the bottom of the boots are not smooth. They feel like suede/fabric. Unless you toss them in the washing machine after every use, it is very hard to maintain them and dry them.After using for a few weeks, the bottom of the boots began to break. There are holes on the bottom towards the front of the boots (we do keep his nails clipped frequently). They are no longer waterproof anymore. The company's website stated that ""many dogs have worn their Muttluks for over three years"", but it only lasted just over a month for our dog. We never use them on dry pavement or concrete. We only use them to protect his feet from salt when there's snow.The boots are also not very easy to put on. It takes us about 10 min to put all of them on the dog."
4,Protects and keeps paws clean!,"These are wonderful for keeping my dogs feet clean & dry. He's the type of dogs with tons of fur between his toes and he always managed to find the mud anytime he'd go out after it rained. Now he always comes in clean! There is about a week learning curve for you and your dog to effectly and efficently get them on without one coming off outside. They work great in the rain, snow & ice and are machine washable. My only complaint is that they don't quite last as long as I think they should, considering the amount of time they're actually worn. My dog is 7 years old and I just bought him his third pair. Still the best dog shoe on the market."
5,"Sara Lazarus, a great talent","This lady has the style and class of the classic female jazz aingers, from Billie to Ella to Carmen to Sarah V. This CD has some great tunes, great arrangments, a great back up band and a great singer on it. I highly recommend it."
5,Good stuff,"Really happy with this watch. Very wearable, not too expensive. So light and comfy, it feels like you are wearing nothing! Date might be hard to see if you have bad eyes. Bracelet is somewhat fragile. I stupidly wore it when I was working on my car and it caught on something, but most people shouldn't have problems. Really easy to adjust for your wrist! Clasp works great. Very aesthetically pleasing and thin! all stainless steel is also a bonus."
2,Didn't Last A Week,"I read all of the reviews on this watch and saw some claimed the crystal broke without any trauma. I figured that just couldn't be....well, this was the magical exploding watch that didn't last a week. The watch was sitting on the table when the crystal just broke and little glass chards scattered about the table. We've never seen anything like it! There is certainly a design flaw with this watch. I loved the sleek look and the lightweight titanium band...but had to return it due to the exploding crystal."
1,"Not so good, as I aspect.",This item is look's good. but when i ordered i found problem on that watch.
2,What is THIS????,Why only 9 songs????? What the f*** is that??? You don't really need this alubm because the songs are basics and if you know the 70s you're well aware of them. I actually got it free from my uncle so i don't have to worry about prices. Don't buy this album unless hell freezes over.2 best songs- Boys are Back in Town & You Wear it Well2 worst songs- thick as a brick & show me the Way
3,New niv bible,"The bible is nice ,can as described except the cover I thought was a different color when I bought it.This was a gift for a friend and I was hoping she didn't mind the color which she didn't.The content is more important than the cover anyway,but I believe it should be as advertised in the picture."
4,Nice Bible,I bought this Bible for myself and it's great. It's a 14pt Print and so a true large print. I like the translation but bought it more for the print. It can also be a good men's bible as well
4,Great,I was not pleased with the fact that I could not be given a direct delivery date at the time of order but the book arrived before Christmas and my grandmother loves it.Thanks
5,Perfect!,"I bought many bibles looking for the perfect size, font, version and ease of use and this is the one. I love the larger font and the thumb index that helps me get to the book I want quickly. And the price was good too...well worth it."
5,Quality product at a good price,Exactly what I was looking for .....the large-size font was the largest available (the ink/paper had good contrast) but the Bible itself was not too heavy to carry around with much effort.... I wish it came in a Burgundy cover.
4,NIV Large Print Reference Bible,"Zondervan publishes many types of NIV bibles. I like the format and easy reading of this font size (11.5). This bible does not have the ""bleed through"" of Christ text in red present in several other of thier bibles availble today.The translation, font size has worked very well for me. These older eyes do need help and this bible fills that need."
5,excellent reading bible,"I like this bible because of the large print, easy to handle and softness. I have many study bibles but the note get me off the track. This is my favorite one to just read."
1,"Did not receive. Got a notice from USPS that an empty wrapper was found, and a copy of shipping label. Notified Amazon, but no","Did not receive this item. On Friday, 5-16. I received a notice from the USPS that an empty wrapper was found in the mail, together with a piece of paper containing the product info. Notified Amazon, but no one replied."
4,Accuracy + Ease of a Read = Enjoyable Study,"The combination of the NASB and The Message Bible is perfect for anyone who wants to study a very accurate translation of the scripture, while having a very easy to understand translation right next door. That is the beauty of this bible. I only wish The Message had verse numbers, but that only delays you a few extra seconds of scout time until you find the scripture. I highly recommend this for anyone who desires accuracy, but also wants it to be easy to understand."
3,What is the fascination?,"I give this one a '3' star recommendation due to the fact that it represents only one Bible therein---the NASB. The other half contains The Message by Eugene Peterson, which some people purport to be a Bible. It is not a Bible. It is a book of Bible stories by Eugene Peterson. Why people are so fascinated by this book continually amazes me. As far as the NASBU is concerned, it is a literal and readable translation of the Scriptures that is word-for-word accurate. I would recommend that you save yourself some money and just buy yourself a New American Standard Bible that has all the amenities. rather than settle for this edition."
4,Fantastic resource,"I am grateful for this dual, side-by-side Bible. While I rely on the more authentic translation of the New Revised Standard when preparing my sermons, it's nice to have these two to be able to offer another perspective.My only ""complaint"" is that the pages are kind of then, so making notes or underlines has to be done carefully."
3,terrifying,This book was terrifying. I've read other books by this author which were terrifying and suspenseful. This one I thought she described in too much detail the sexual component to the crimes. It could have been more understated and still been suspenseful.
4,Dearly Beloved by Wendy Corsi Staub,"I have read most of Wendy Corsi Staub's books and enjoy all of them. Dearly Beloved held your interest from the very first page. If you like mystery and suspense, you'll like this book."
4,"What goes around, comes around","This saying could never be more truthful than in this book. Sandy, Liza, and Jennie (pretending to be her twin sister) are all about to make a journey in which not all of them will survive. The past is about to come back to haunt them in the form of a man who has been a part of each of their lives.Ms Staub has written a good solid thriller, it's not really a mystery because fairly early on she reveals who this stranger is. The intrigue of this book is the unfolding of the story and learning how each woman made an impact on this man's life and how he reacts to that impact. The characters are fun, real, and engaging. If there is a moral to this story, it's be careful how you treat others, you may not live to regret it."
4,"Great, Fast read!","I've read all of Staub's books, and I found I actually liked this one more than I thought. Although the ""girls stranded on an island with killer"" is a familiar one, she manages to give suspense even when you think you know what's coming. Great characters and she spares no one!"
3,Not her best...,"I have read all of Wendy Corsi Staub's books and have been mostly impressed by them. However, this one seemed less creative and realistic than some of the others. I didn't feel like I knew the characters well enough to really care about them, either. It was more violently graphic than her other books, as well, something I don't appreciate. Though Staub has a great talent for suspense stories, I'd suggest ""The Last to Know"" and ""In the Blink of an Eye"" over this one. ""Dearly Beloved"" was just okay."
4,Great Mystery book,"Three girls travel to the Bramble Rose Inn in Tides Island, a remote vacation island off the coast of New England. Each are asked to attend a different function in order for the killer toget them there.Once they are there the killer calls each of them away from the inn and tries to marry them, ( only in his mind of course) A storm bears down on the island and makes it impossible to leave.The characters are well defined and are very likeable. Except for the killer and his demented ways about himself. The inn keeper who is the killer's friend, is also portrayed as alittle strange and wierd.The book was good, and catavated you right away."
5,Wendy Corsi Staub is one to read,"I've read 4 books by Ms. Staub and I have to say all were very good. Dearly Beloved is another thriller from her. She has a host of characters, but manages to tie them into the storyline. She keeps you guessing to the very end."
5,Motivating a Change,"I loved this book!. I'm 40 this year and after struggling with my much weight and not feeling as good about myself as I would like too, the stories and advice in this book were hugely motivating. It was very refreshing to read the words of real people and how they used Laura's methods to achieve success, not the words of a celebrity author just trying to make more money. This is not just another fad diet book that falls short of a permanent change. Been there, done that. Also, the beauty and styling tips are great, especiall the section on eyes and eyebrows. If you are in your 30's or 40's a bit overweight and looking for a change -- I recommend you read this!"
5,Great product and service !!!!!!!!,Really great service and product is just what was described and price was the best around!!!!! I highly recommend anyone to buy from this company thanks....
3,So So,Mainly general information that is available many places. Realistic valuations and a lot more about costs of authentications would make this book much more useful.
3,Castaway,"CastawayThis book Castaway was about a boy who was struggling for his life.When he and another friend were in boat, they got too close to shore,and they were flung into the rocks and the other boy was nowhere to be found . The other boy managed to find an ore and paddle himself to this island. There was absolutely no live thing on this island. He was straneded on this island all by him elf. He struggles for his life and managed to survive ooff fish and clams. He was able to survive uder very harsh conditions. Then he saw a boat and he waved, but the boat went right by him. After that he became very depressed. Then two months later he found and saw a boat, and he waved. This boat came down to him, and he was picked up and left the island and he was left happy ever after. What I feel about this book that is I think it was a very informative book to read and to learn about survival book, and this book made me think about how privileged to have what I had."
4,2nd Favorite MacLean,"This novel is my 2nd favorite that MacLean wrote (so far). There is plenty of adventure as the story takes many twists and turns. The character of Professor Witherspoon is the one who makes the story great, but there are others too. Fans of MacLean won't be disappointed with this novel nor will one who enjoys reading spy/adventure novels."
4,"Nice combination of ""life"" and ""thought""","England works hard to not only tell the story of Pratt's life, but also to understand his theology and methods of thinking. One of the most interesting parts of the biography was explaining the virtual poverty that Pratt and his families lived in due to his sacrifices to promulgate the gospel. When Pratt's extreme circumstances are understood, it becomes difficult to question his the sincerity of his testimony of the work of Joseph Smith, the LDS movement, and even plural marriage. In many ways Orson Pratt was the most controversial of the early apostles that stayed in the Church, but his humility and willingness to accept reproof, are a real testament to his greatness. Today he is one of the lesser known figures of the Restoration, but when England puts his theological impact into context, it becomes clear just how important he was."
3,Playing the Percentages,"I liked this because it started out with a premise I could get behind: 80% of photographic evidence of UFOs can be explained away; 15% is insufficient to be sure; 5% is ""very interesting."" For me that was not only reasonable, but pretty darned compelling. They use reports from astronauts, air traffic controllers, and pilots to back up their theories."
3,So many conspiracies!!,"This is an insane DVD with SO many UFO conspiracies detailed by experts in the field...it WILL make you paranoid. Cover up after cover up, governments using alien technology, political figures involved...it will blow your mind. My mind--BLOWN."
4,"So far, so good","I am very satisfied with this product so far. I'm expecting a baby, and I purchased this for extra storage room for his clothes. It was very easy to put together; I did it myself at 8.5 months pregnant! It was very light weight, no tools are required for assembly and it is easy to maneuver. There is also plenty of room in the bottom of the unit for extra storage bins, a shoe rack, etc. The only thing I wish it had was 2 hanger bars instead of 1. Overall I definitely think I got a good product for the purchase price."
4,Works Great for the Price..,"Great product, might get another one to hung and store jackets and sweaters.. except for the wheels, which is not stable.But it works for me without the wheels. or else i would give it a 5 star.."
5,'...it's the price you pay for the life you choose...',"While Michael said this to Vincent in 'Godfather III'. It easily describes the tragedy of Joseph P. Kennedy and his progeny.The American Experience footage, interviews and comments by those who were there, make this the definitive look back at the point in time that forever changed America. We haven't been the same since. This saga is the end of our national innocence. It's as real a look at what happened as we'll see in our lifetime. Much better than that drivel on Reelzchannel."
4,Good energy saving ideas,"This was a quick read. The suggestions were mostly beginer or obvious. In hind sight, I should have rented it from the library as it has just sat on the shelf since the first read."
3,Heat and What Can Be Done With It,"I skimmed this book very rapidly so this is not a comprehensive review. I bought it looking for ""how to"" information on solar energy. I didn't find it, at least in an easy to assimilate and put to use form. What I did find was almost a dissertation about heat at the level of a physics class: what heat is, what its innate properties are, where it comes from, where it goes, etc. It actually is fascinating reading and probably makes an extremely good foundation for the most efficient use of all the forms of energy that we use in our daily rounds. But it wasn't what I needed, super-fast. I may contact the author from his blurb on the inside back cover of the book for help."
2,Not for older homes,"The book is much too thorough in some ways and not thorough enough in others. It is too through because the author will go on for pages about Ohms and Btus and Watt hours to the point where my eyes glazed over and I found it a very good sleep aid. He doesn't know how to get to the point and put his suggestions in an easy to understand synopsis. Other topics are covered in an almost off hand way or not at all, for example, we own a house built in 1912, and for us this book was nearly completely irrelevant. There is no discussion of the issues facing a homeowner with an older home. So if your looking for an easy to understand, easy to apply book that will help you make your home more efficient and save money, look elsewhere. There is certainly lots of information in this book, if you like sitting down at night with your hot water heater's manual, this book is ideal - but I didn't find it easily understandable or useful and can't recommend it."
5,The way the Bible sees human nature and character,This work makes an effort to provide an understanding of the Bible's conception of human nature and character. It will give new insight to anyone for whom the nature of the Biblical picture of the world is important.
4,Partition,"I love Jimi Mystry no matter what he is in...I was pleasantly surprised that this story kept my attention because of the twists and turns it threw out to me.For shooting most of it in Canada, I was totally fooled at the scenery, really believing it was in India that it was shot.The other actors were quite good; as well as the costume design..I wish Jimi would not had to have a beard, He would have looked too good for this story to be believable.I am very glad I purchased this DVD."
1,Partition pas en franais !!!,"J'ai bien reu le dvd mais c'étais bien indiqué sur l'article sur amazon que la langue était en anglais et/ou en franais et la je viens de le visionner, ce n'est que en anglais et sous titré !! pas de sous titre franais !!!!"
4,Hard to find (in the US) but worth the search,"Partition is a beautifully-shot and well-told love story, and this disc features a gorgeous transfer. The commentary (director Vic Sarin and actress Kristin Kreuk) is informative and interesting, and the making of featurette is long. The disc isn't cheap, but it's certainly worth the money; the film sparkles, even on a smaller screen, and the extras are well worth the price."
4,An Eye for an Eye MAKES the whole WORLD go BLIND,"An Eye for an Eye MAKES the whole WORLD go BLINDThe scenery is poetically beautiful. The colors are lively. The plot is touching. It has some twists. Some of its are predictable. The lead female character played by Kristin Kreuk is so lovely and gentle. Jimi Mistry is convincing in many scenes. I saw and felt the pain in his face in many scenes.This is the right time to show this movie. Just like in the film, today people are killing one another in the name of religions. They don't tolerate one another. This picture shows that only love, tolerance and kindness can eliminate hatred and bring peace to us.It's absolutely worth buying."
5,Nice bracelet at a nice price,"This bracelet has a nice weight and feels solidly constructed. While it is adjustable, just how it is adjustable is a bit deceptive. The links appear to be held together by screws. In actuality, the links are held together by rivets (for the lack of a better word) that are pressed into a hollow shaft. So instead of unscrewing the pins, you actually have to pry them apart. With that bit of knowledge, it's fairly easy to adjust the size of the bracelet. My personal suggestion is to use a toothpick or straight pin to put a drop of super glue into the hollow shaft when replacing the rivet to help prevent it from working loose. Also worth noting is that because of the overlapping link structure, the links have to be removed in a ""set"" of outer and inner links so they'll fit correctly. Now that mine is just a few links smaller, I love this bracelet."
3,Could be better.,"Being into the world of metal, this thing was quite neat looking on the site. Once it was opened and taken out of the box is another thing. I think I was hoping for just a plain polished stainless steel piece, what I got was a stainless steel piece with a chrome or silver plating. The plating makes the links of this thing hard to move. I find that it binds up alot especially in the center. I gave it 3 stars cause of the plating and overall look of it. I was hoping for a rugged looking chunk of chain and what I got was a quirky lil ornamental thing.Not amazons fault nor the fault of the seller, I should have looked a lil better at what I was buying. Overall, nice piece just not what I was expecting. I kept it though and do wear it."
4,"Nice bracelet, cheap looking package","The bracelet is nice and solid. It comes in a cheap plastic bag and at first I was disappointed. When taking the bracelet out though, it is well made and if it holds up, might be worth the price. Other than having to repackage it to give it as a gift, I am happy with it."
1,TOO THIN,THIS BRACELET IS PERFECT FOR A YOUNG LADY BUT IT'S TOO THIN FOR A MAN UNLESS YOU ARE A RACE HOURSE JOCKEY( 5 FOOT 105 LBS.)
2,good service,I got this bracelet extremely fast. Unfortunuately my boyfriend did not like it. I sent it back and received a refund. Very pleased with the service.
2,short life...,"Works great for 6 months, then the product just stop working and it wasn`t battery problems..."
2,Not worth even $8...,"Should have known by the price, but this thing doesn't trim much of anything. I can put it right up against a hair and it takes a good deal of repositioning and time consuming acrobatics just to trim it. Very weak blade and very little power. I'm back to using scissors..."
1,Item you would find at the bottom of your cracker jacks,"This item arrived and is a piece of cheap china junk,...it was not the same product ordered... and when we plugged it in it did not even heat enough to create steam... amazon is making it right but this is truly a piece"
5,"Kaz steamer is excellent, works perfectly.",I purchased this product based on the reviews I read and found it to be just as others had experienced. It steams up quickly and has a great flow of steam. With the aging process I have found my facial pores to be more enlarged and I hoped this product might help. After just 2 weeks of daily use my skin does indeed have a much more youthful tone. And . . .without the cost of expensive cream and surgery. I love this product!
5,"I really LOVE this steamer, but...","...it really puts out some pretty HOT steam. You honestly have to be pretty careful, so not to get burned by the steam. But...I would rather have a facial steamer that puts out lots of warm steam (which it definitely does) than one that does not. I personally take a towel and drape it over my head and the face of the steamer to sort of trap the steam..but still keeping about a foot of distance between my face and the steamer. I'm still giving this facial steamer 5 stars because it's very well made and powerful for the price I paid."
1,broke immediately/no more produced,"The steamer broke immediately. CacheBeauty told me to call Kaz directly (Since I had bought it more than 30 days before they were not responsible anymore). Unfortunately Kaz does not produce this product anymore so they couldn't do anything either.If I were you I would rather buy the Conair Facial Sauna, Conair is still producing it."
1,Buyer Beware,"Only gave one star since giving it none was not an option.This product was a huge disappointment, which is really saying something given the fact that what it is supposed to do is pretty simple. Had I seen it in a store, I would never have purchased it even for $5 let alone $30. Cheap construction and no steam output even after 30 minutes of fiddling with it to get the proper ""salt content"" for the unit to operate. The box it came in promoted it as a room vaporizer. The Conair steamer I had years ago did not have the huge tank to double as a room vaporizer- just a little concentrated area for water and a huge, concentrated steam output. Cache Beauty flatly (and rudely)refused to refund the shipping cost for a defective item and I am now out the $8.80 they charged for shipping PLUS the cost to send the piece of trash back to them. Terrible customer service and a terrible product. Shop elsewhere."
5,A very good product,I purchased the steam facial device about a month and a half ago and have been using it daily since then. It works great. It has inproved my complexion tremendously. It starts to generate steam almost instantly. It is very sturdly and does everything that it promises.
4,Not Bad for its Price,The steamer has been working fine since I bought it. It is simple and it does its function well.
3,OK but not great product,"This product is ok; it's more convenient than using a bowl of boiled water to steam, but not much more so. Cheap construction and materials; not sure how long this unit will last. As another reviewer pointed out, the steam is not projected and you must position your face above the product -- again, not much of an improvement from a bowl of boiled water. Also, while the photos show you do not need to place a towel around your head/face to capture the steam, I found the quantity of steam insufficient without a towel. The steam generation is not consistent or continuous; you can feel it somewhat pulsing or fluctuating.Yes, there are better facial steamers available, as one reviewer pointed out. But note that those will cost $250+, as well as about $65 in shipping from Japan."
2,No change in skin,"Gives lots of steam, but I really didn't notice any change in my skin. The container is unnecessarily big for a regular facial and occupies a lot of space. I wish I had ordered a more managable-sized steamer."
3,Steam Facial,It works great.....just need to have a on/off switch. It becomes a hassle to plug and unplug if you have to step away for a minute or two which sometimes can turn into 15 minutes.
1,Disappointing product & customer services,"If you are like me that look for easy-use, low-maintenance product, think twice.According to the instructions, I need to add exactly right amount of salt to make it work every time. I also need to soak the steam unit in the vinegar once a week as the maintenance. I've contacted the vendor by email and 2 phone calls and the customer service experiences were not pleasant. And they seem to have no confidence in their production either that they do not offer satisfaction guarantee.I really wish that someone had listed the above facts earlier so I would not have paid for something that I tossed away and, in turn, needed to make purchase from other vendor!!!!"
5,***THE BEST STEAMER OUT THERE!!***,"I looked on amazon for a facial steamer and purchased this one based on customer reviews. When I used it for the first time I instantly knew I would also have to write a review. This steamer is AMAZING! It heats up as soon as you plug it in! Steam begins after only 20 seconds! I wanted a powerful steamer and almost opted for the more expensive brands--DONT DO IT! This steamer is effective and more than affordable! Paired with a good exfoliator, and my pore cleansing tools, it's like getting my profesional facials done at home!! LOVE IT:-)"
4,Good and fun Switchfoot,"Yeah so this is a typical good Switchfoot album. Virtually the same kind of style as the Beautiful Letdown, but a bit more guitars. I can't see any Switchfoot fan having a problem with this album.I actually am writing this to deal with the copy protection. The best way to deal with it is to upload the CD and use Windows Media Player to burn a copy. You can use the copy to upload the songs to iTunes. Works fine, but you have to burn it as an audio CD.Oh, I heard that the DualDisc doesn't have the copy protection. Maybe that's not true, but it's probably better to get it anyway."

5,Can't get much better than this,"I thought it would be impossible for Switchfoot to follow up the Beautiful Letdown (2004), which sold 2 million copies world wide, with another incredible album but that's exactly what they did. After picking up this CD, the day it came out, I soon found out that Jon Foreman and the rest of the boys are true geniuses. The albums fourth track ""The Shadow Proves the Sunshine"" is one of the most beautfiful songs ever written by man (I know it sounds a little too much, but just listen to it three times, you'll see). And it doesn't stop there. The entire record is incredible. I can't really put it into words. You just have to pick it up and listen. It will change your life. It changed mine and I am counting the days until their next album hit the stores."
1,Do NOT buy copy-protected CDs!,"I went ballistic when I saw that nasty ""content-protected"" logo on the CD. Sony/BMG continue to alienate their market by treating consumers like potential crooks. Copy protection is insensitive to the needs of the consumer, and it reeks of arrogance. What if I want to rip the CD to iTunes AND keep a physical copy? Well, thanks to the geniuses at Sony/BMG, I can't. NEVER buy ANY copy-protected CD. Avoid like the plague."
1,Dont waste your money on this............,"This CD is terrible, trying to follow up the beautiful letdown, listening to this is a BIG LETDOWN.....Also, what is up with all the protection nonsense on this disc?It wont play in my car and will play on my computer after going through a lot of screens.Dont worry SF, I WONT be making copies of this piece of crap excuse for music!"
