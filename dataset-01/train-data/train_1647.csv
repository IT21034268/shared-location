3,Cold Sweat- Bronson,"Have seen this movie in 70s and Bronson was a rage then. Seeing this after so many years, felt that this was dated. Didn't excite me as much, though of course have seen some scene copied in some Hindi films"
2,no improvement in 50 years,"I first read this book around 1960. It was a local sensation due to being modeled on the little southern Ohio town I was living in. At 14-years of age I didn't understand the book, saw no socially redeeming value in it but chalked that up to my youth. Now, fifty years later, I have revisited Mr. Frank's novel and once again found it lacking in positive characteristics. I certainly found no person in the book I could or would want to relate to or consider a hero. I was left with a feeling of sadness and confusion over just what it was that the author had tried to say. Two stars is too much but I can't really say I hate it."
5,a great r&b cd,"I love this group. I listen to this cd all the time. I also listen to thier old cd. It's great to listen to also. If you like listening to R. Kelly, Keith Sweat, Silk and Blackstreet you'll love listening to this group."
4,There Back!!!!!!!!!!!,Being from the Chi myself I always check for artist coming from my hometown. 3pc. is a very underrated group. Their new CD is off the chain. I look forward to them releasing more music.
3,wasnt too impressed with this one,"im not a die hard meteors fan. some stuff i like some i dont. nothing really too catchy on here. my favorite song isnt even a real song. its music with an interview over top of it. but its cool, the title song-meteors vs the world. cool tune"
4,A good supplement for Houellebecq fans,"As with other Houellebecq novels, this one has moments of cynical wisdom and hilarious black humor. However, the scope of the book is a bit limited, and seems to be a supplement (or extra chapter) for 'The Possibility of an Island.'If you want to read a great Houellebecq novella, go with 'Whatever.' It's plot is self-contained. Regardless, 'Lanzarote' is a great snack, and can be read in 2 - 4 hours."
2,Too Much for Me,"I liked the author's most recent book, even though it was pretty twisted. The earlier two, including this one, were too gruesome for me!"
5,Nice,"Bought this to give as a gift and am disappointed that Amazon did not show in its picture that the company name is on one of the cuffs. Other than that, it seems well made, true to size and color and really well priced."
1,Don't buy it,"I didn't realize this book was written in the late 70's when I bought it. My fault, I guess. Crappy information, crappy builds. Save yoiur money."
2,Not effective on black hair,"I purchased this to dye my black eyebrows, hoping it would turn medium brown, or at least dark brown. I followed the instructions and left it in for 5-7 minutes. I didn't show any difference, so I tried again and same happened. I have sensitive skin so it irritated. On the plus side, it was easy to mix. It would probably work for blond eyebrows."
1,Defective blades?,"I've used these wiper blades previously and they worked great. The most recent pair I installed, however, is horrendous. They make a terribly loud squeaking/chopping noise while barely cleaning the windshield. I think I must've got a bad set since the rubber part on both blades is much harder than it should be. Oh well, time to go buy some Bosch Micro Edges..."
2,clean but make noise,"I installed this to replace the old one. It wipes clean, but in both ends of the movement, there are uncomfortable scratching noise. Feel not good."
4,Pretty good for the money,Had these for about three months now. No real complaints. Survived an icy and snowy winter. Quiet and don't streak. The end piece of one blade did pop off but I was able to easily pop it back on (may have happened when it got stuck in snow). Installation instructions are terrible but I was able to figure out how to get them on.
3,"Chatters if your windshield is ""curvy""","I got this for my 2001 Audi A4. Apparently it doesn't ""fit"" the curve as good as more expensive bracketless models.Result is an annoying chatter. I replaced it with a Bosch ICON and no more chatter.So this is not a negative review of the product itself, but be warned that it doesn't fit all cars.I purchased the ANCO 3115 for my rear hatch window and that worked out much better.Just wish this would fit better on my car since it does wipe as good as the $15 Bosh."
5,Great wiper,So far I am very pleased with the ANCO wiper blade. Big improvement over the past few brands I have used.
3,The best thing about this product is the price,The best thing about this product is the price. Their aren't perfect because it makes a streaking noise at first and the quality isn't that great. I recommend them because they are much cheaper than other blades. I live in southern california so the weather's not worth investing in high quality wiper blades.
4,A real good value.,"The cost of the wipers plus shipping is a great value and the blades give a great dry, streak-free sweep.The rubber seems new and is very flexible. The date now is Thanksgiving 2009. I expect this set to last 2 yrs."
5,Works well,"I waited until there suitable weather in order to test this properly. With this morning's heavy rains and wind gusts up to 50mph, it seemed like a good time to put this wiper blade to good use. With the wipe speed at medium, the wiper blade was able to wipe away the rain without leaving streaks, thus allowing me to see the road clearly. It worked just as well as the more expensive adjacent wiper blade I had installed earlier.Installation of the wiper blade was pretty easy as it just hooks on and took less than 5 minutes."
1,china made junk,"this worked for a few days than got hard to pull trigger , now grand son doesnt want to play with it because of this, would not recomend this"
2,capsules,go get yourself powder form. the serving size is 3-4 horse sized capsules 3 times a day. The bottle will last you 1 week. I ended up grinding the pills after 3 days.
5,M,This is one hell of an overlooked artist with the exception in France of course! He should be known worldwide as the man has skills and can play some freakin good songs!This is the best compilation in terms of getting an overall idea of what his music is all about. Well basically his only big song Pop Musik is missing but still. This is very much well worth checking out if you're into good musique.
4,Israel Has only One Warrior -Yahweh,"Lind has made a remarkable revelation. Yahweh is a warrior but he is the only warrior. Israel's role is to have implicit faith and Yahweh will take care of their enemies. The patriarchs were not war-like and even in the Exodus, Yahweh bore the weight of the fighting. Israel unlike all other countries did not rely on kings or warriors but on prophets."
3,Interesting Read,Three interesting exotic love stories by three different authors. Still the One is about a boy's crush / love lasting throughout his life for a very slightly older woman. Her Wildest Fantasy is about a woman's journey to actualizing her fantasy. Pure Pleasure is about two adults letting go so they can hold each other. On the 1 to 10 erotic scales; I place this book at a 4. On the 1 to 10 adult love story scales; I place this book at a 10.
2,pet booties,I purchased these dog booties as the ad said they were waterproof. I have found that they are not waterproof. Cute but did not serve the purpose I needed.
5,Life changing perspective,"This book was recommended to me by a therapist who deals specifically with eating disorders. I started reading the book and immediately became engrossed. O'Malley really does take a revolutionary approach to compulsive behavior by asking us to see our compulsions as friends rather than enemies. After a lifetime of battling my compulsions and hating their control over my life, I am slowly learning to listen to what they are trying to say. Like young children, our compulsions are desperate for our attention.While I don't really relate to O'Malley's humanistic perspective, I was still able to apply her ideas within the framework of my own spiritual beliefs. No matter what your ""world view"", I think this book has a great deal to offer those of us who are tired of fighting and losing the battle of our compulsions."
4,Thrilled a Galle' lover,"My aunt is 96 years old and as you can guess, it's a little hard to buy unique gifts for her. She has had a Galle lamp since the 1950's and adores it. Recently on a visit we were talking about her lamp and she said she didn't know much about it or Galle. She once had it appraised by a gentleman from New York that told her the lamp was worth between $8000 and $10,000 but couldn't tell her much of anything about Emile Galle. I bought this book for her as well as another on Galle and she loves it!! She was like a little kid talking about all the beautiful pictures and telling me about Galle. While I haven't personally seen the book, I think it's wonderful just because it thrilled my wonderful aunt!!!"
5,Best product on the market! Absolutely the most reliable!,As always Iomega has the best products. They always make a reliable product. They have great support for their products and this is no exception.This is an extremely fast 2GB drive that is faster than 90% hard drives out there.
4,penguin sweater,"The penguin sweater is adorable! It arrived at my home within a few days of ordering. At first it was too large, so I had to send it back for a smaller one. They sent the new one out right away. It fits perfect!"
4,I really like this story about elephants.,Several years ago I listened to this on tape. I liked it so much that i bought the book and then I bought this one to give to a friend.
5,The Eye of the Elephant,"This is one of the most fascinating books that I have ever read.The authors are enjoying a most spectacular life.In this book they recount their adventures( all in first person )in the wildest & remotest wilderness in Africa while intensively studying African elephants. Their is an extremely strong emphasis on wildlife conservation, something to which this fascinating couple has devoted there entire adult lives."
2,Wasn't a favorite,This was for my son. It was a book for a class in college. He said it wasn't his favorite
3,Not a great read,"I'm fairly obsessed with Gene Kelly and ordered this book because of the promise of a more accurate biography than some others out there and because of the pictures. There are nice pictures and the first part of the book does reveal what I had hoped to learn about Gene Kelly. Worth the price for that much. Other than that, the book is poorly written, incredibly dull and sophomoric. The author is so incredibly self-involved, conceited and immature, it leaves the Gene Kelly fan somewhat disappointed in his taste in women."
4,A Star You Never Heard Of,"Betsy Blair was married to Gene Kelly(for a while), appeared in a few films, and was a political activist. It was an active and interresting life. Although I do not agree with Miss Blair's politics, I enjoyed this book and recommend it."
1,Never Received my book after three e-mails to complain!,"I am seriously disappointed in both Tutts Booksellers and Amazon. I ordered this book one month ago and have yet to receive it. I have e-mailed the book seller twice and Amazon once...never received one reply, nor my money back. I would have like to have read the book, but apparently that won't happen!"
1,"""I Love Lucy"" without the humor.","The above detailed reviews all match my own opinions of this book,and are generally better written than the book. What a ditsy dame!The Hollywood frou-frou is from an old fan magazine, or somesuch automatic input. Her perceptions of herself are just asvague and silly. One would only read this in desperation totry to find out more about Gene Kelly, genius of the dance.Slim pickings indeed! And not even an ""as told to"" entry.This book is without value on any level."
5,"As Low Budget Features Go, This One is Epic!","THE JANITOR is what it is - a low budget Troma style Blood, Gore and Boobies Romp - that being said - it's a great one!The characters are memorable, the gags are totally over the top, the laughs are all over the place, and the body-count is enormous!It's obvious watching the extras (which ELITE did a fantastic job with), that these guys didn't have much money at all, yet went out and gave it their blood, sweat and tears... their excitement for the material shines brightly, and as long as you go in expecting what it is - a gory, goofy, independent midnight movie - you should have a blast...I have a new found respect for Custodians and I can't want to see what these guys do next!"
3,certainly interesting,"Movie certainly has plenty of gore. The nudity is not very sexy, but the overall concept is very good. Worthy of watching, but not high-tech effects."
1,IT'S A TROMA MOVIE!!!!!,"Did'nt realize how much of a Troma movie this was, juvinile acting, FX, the whole nine yards, let me put it this way, this makes Redneck Zombies look like Citizen Kane...... But for a NO BUDGET movie... ah what am I saying, not even worth the price for the gore, and this is coming from someone who is very forgiving, save your money (I wish I had) and buy something like REPO! The Genetic Opera! You'll Have a much more fulfilling experience!!!"
2,"Not even ""The Janitor"" can clean up this mess.....","""The Janitor"" gets two stars for its gore alone. The gore is cheesy and somewhat funny and is the only part of this movie that is worth viewing. The actors, delivery, story and direction are totally horrendous.I agree with the reviewer who said it's impossible to watch this movie and not hit fast forward. I was wide awake when the movie started and fell fast asleep before the halfway mark!There are much better examples of independent horror out there. Nobody is going to gain anything or find anything unique in this film. It just downright sucks.Im a huge fan of independant, horror, and B movies but this one is beyond bad. ""The Janitor"" reminded me of a student video or film school class project - in which case I'd give it a D+.If your under 14 or under you may like this movie but everyone else should look for something better to satisfy their horror fix!Garbage!"
3,A fun and gory ride,"I pretty good dvd horror film, the film is about a janitor who kills his co-workers when they wrong him. It has humor,gore(LOTS of it) but not alot of T&A like another reveiwer said(almost none accually except for 2 scenes). This is a very bloodly film so if you are not into that then you may not like this. Watch for a cameo by Troma's Lloyd Kaufman as a drunk hobo. When the janitors dream job is taken from him by someone he trusted,he must go out and get bloodly revenge. Good humar, lots of gore and a pretty good story make this a movie any horror fan should own on dvd, especially if your a fan of any Troma film."
5,CULT CLASSIC,this has gotta to be the BEST horror film ive seen in a long time. well worth the 13 bucks it cost me and well worth the 14 times ive seen it since i got it. you cant go wrong with this purchase.
5,Not your standard high school poetry book,"When a friend gave me this book I silently rolled my eyes, remembering the rhyming verse I had be forced to endure in English classes; or worse yet the stuff that didn't rhyme.Honestly this book is just captivating. Inside is a collection of tales that go to the heart of life, from the seemingly mundane to the extraordinary.What impressed me most was the multilayered depth I found in each short (Almost always less than two pages) tale, not only by what was said but by the oftimes more profound given between it's well written lines. I've taken to reading just one short tale in the morning; carrying it with me throughout my day to ponder and amuse.This sure ain't the book of poetry I was expecting.Gene Smith"
5,Second Time Around,This is our second purchase of this product because we needed more than 8 trays for our raclette parties. It works just as well as the more expensive raclette grills. Easy to clean and maintain. Our 2 year old raclette grill looks almost as good as our new grill.
2,Not a true raclette grill,"I was very diappointed with this grill. The set does not include any scrapers to scrape out the cheese, or any tongs to help you grill your food on the top grill. I was hoping for more from T-Fal. It's also very compact, which is great for storage, but horrible if 8 of you are trying to use the grill at the same time."
3,Raclette specialist,"I bought this unit for its ""not too"" expensive price. I have a concern however over the fact that the instruction manual specifically says not to leave the grilling plate without any food on it for more than 30 minutes. Usually, you eat raclette with the melted cheese, proscuitto ham and boiled potatoes. You DON'T need to cook something on the grill above. I was wondering how the people that use the unit deal with that problem? Are you forced to use the grill on top of the unit even though you are not interested in it?Thanks for commenting"
4,Fun social activity,Great for small gatherings with friends and family. The grooves in the cooking surface are a bit hard to clean and the cord could be a few feet longer. A temperature control would have been appreciated as well. Altogether tasty and fun. Perfect for a game night or birthday.
1,I would not recommend this raclette grill,"I ordered this item and was disappointed with the quality of this product. ""You get what you pay for""."
5,Raclette question?????,Pls can you answer :1. This is eletric sistem????2. How do you can export to Brazil? How freight rate?Thank youCristina
1,"... maybe ""2 stars"" -- because its inexpensive...","This grill is fine if you intend to eat raclette for fun once a year. But, if you eat raclette on a regular basis I'd recommend buying the heavier, more durable and reliable (and more expensive) model. As for performance, I found the T-Fal model heated too hot, too quickly and, since it doesn't have a temperature control, I had to control the heat buy plugging in and unplugging the unit throughout the meal -- not very conducive to a relaxing evening entertaining friends."
3,Nice introductory set,"For the price, the T-Fal is not bad. The set does not come with spatula or turner so you need to get your own. The light coat of nonstick and the construction makes it feel durable enough for occational but not frequent use. The lack of variable temperature control makes it a little more work to just enjoy if you have to unplug and plug to prevent the food from burning.I'm returning the T-Fal for something a little more heavy-duty, maybe the Swissmar."
2,Zeiss = not always great,"I thought this would be my ""be all end all"" monocular, and it seemed to have a lot going for it; light weight, nice objective size, alleged Zeiss quality, etc., but what a disappointment. The optics are not great. Chromatic abberations are reasonably well corrected, but the image suffers from softness at the edge of the field and is not terribly impressive. IMHO, it is nowhere near what I would expect from Zeiss. Admittedly, I am a bit of an optics freak, but this means that I have a good basis for comparison (Nikon, Tele Vue, Leica). I ended up selling this monocular to a backpacker, and I hope he is enjoying it, but for me this thing just didn't cut it, and I would imagine anyone else with a discriminating eye would feel the same way."
4,Kids love it!,"Fun DVD for my 2 little ones. Thye love Baby Loonies, but it is hard to find in stores or on tv. only 48 minutes is the only issue."
5,Gammy,My Grandson loves Baby Looney Tunes. I too enjoy them. I hope they never stop making good ole'cartoons like these.
2,Wanted more,"There was only 2 ten minute cartoons, and 2 songs on this DVD. This was way to short for my tastes. My son loves Baby Looney Tunes, but there has to be something out there that offers a little more."
1,Disappointing,This was a dissapointing purchase-much less product inside than expected. $20 for a few sheets of paper and some ribbon...will not purchase from this supplier again.
3,Ok but Small,"I bought this as a gift. It does have a lot of stuff, but it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. It could be good for a beginner."
3,A Live Concert: SRO,"Woods Tea Company has some great CDs- this is a fair one. To here this group live years ago was phenomenal- some members have passed away and new people brought in; all excellent musicians and singers. People in Vermont are lucky they can here the group- fans in the Midwest, not so fortunate."
3,Needle in the Groove ... The CD,"Since i am a hardcore Jeff Noon fan, i procceded to buy his new book Needle in the Groove. then when i found out about this cd and i thought-what a great idea a book with a soundtrack-so i got the book read it and then afterwards i got the cd. i imagined the cd to be filled with techno type climactic music that goes well with the book. but it wasnt, its more like poetry spoken with back round trance music. and well if your a noon fan you'll probably like it, but in my oppion i wanted full songs and am not a big fan of poetry. therefore i dont think its worth $25"
4,like it,I have a young son with Down Syndrome who is love with Amanda Bynes. I bought these movies for him and he loves them.
3,Out of date,"The timing of this book's release is unfortunate because Microsoft made huge changes to DirectX 9 during 2004. As a result, the code in this book is completely obsolete today."
3,Unbiased review,"First of all the retail price of the book is too much. The last section (video on texture and cloth simulation) which he thinks are the most advanced are just pretty lame. He could have better described how to export a skinned mesh better. The ragdoll effect as given is not combined with an animated model making it a bit less useful. The book does cover a lot on using skeletal animation that was definately not covered in other books that I've bought on the subject. I'm also glad that it has no intro to DX section. PS: Who wrote the 5 star review, the author?"
2,Nice to start whit animation,"I buy this book because I can not find another book whit animation on direct x, but you need install the direct x sdk 9 to run the examples, and a good video card, if you not, show you many error of memory, in some cases this book are helpfully if you not have any idea how to made an animation or cloth simulation, I recommend this book for a start into direct animation, the book only help you to take a path to start into game develop, because are very hard to find a book how to show you made animations, there is many things and ideas you can save from this book to use like a guide for a start."
2,My thoughts on this book.,"Advanced Animation with DirectX is not a good book at all. The author did a terrible job on the skinned animation parts and the later parts of the book is just plain bad. The beginning was ok but the code was not right. I tried to implement some of the stuff at the beginning and it didn't work. When I sat down and thought about the problem at hand and how to do it, I got everything working smoothly without using anything that was done is the book (which means the book was a waste of money). Who ever gave this book 5 out of 5 stars must be the author or a friend."
3,Not a Digiweigh Product,"The scale I received is NOT from DigiWeigh though it looks like it was made in the same factory. Same packaging, same accessories, but no branding on anything. The front just says ""Mini digital scale"" in the same color ink that DigiWeigh uses.It seems fairly accurate, but I'll run some tests and see. The price was definitely right."
2,"Less Inside, Less Grand","I love Grand Central Terminal. I love National Geographic. I did not love this documentary. It is not up to the standards of either GCT or NG. Although the cinematography was wonderful, the writing was terrible. Transitions were abrupt and nonsensical. The attempt to combine a chronological structure with a topical one, made the end result choppy. The reuse and over use of the same footage got to be annoying. I thought I was going to get an inside view, and although there was some behind the scenes footage, it wasn't enough to justify the title. It would have been better to have stuck with a true behnd the scenes look at the current Grand Central, and forget the history. Or, conversely, give the history and forget the behind the scenes. And hire a better writer!"
4,Inside Grand Central,"This was good for a review of the restoration of the Grand Central Station. However, I was looking for more of a history, so it wasn't exactly what I wanted. Preservation is of HUGE importance anyway, and I am sure that those who have used the building will thoroughly enjoy it."
2,"Rent this, don't buy it.","Even better: rent something else.This documentary suffered from a lack of a script editor and a video editor. If you're over 30, you'll find the nonstop MTV style swooping camera movement nauseating. Suitable for a documentary on rollercoasters, not on a building.The same phrases are repeated too many times and should have been cut. They should at least be consistent. You will lose count of how many times they tell you how many people a day pass through the station. And the number they tell you keeps changing. Cmon.I found very little substance and at least 30 minutes of useless and repetitive fluff in this documentary. Very disappointing."
1,"Ordered 2 ten packs, tried 3 different chargers, only 4 batteries worked","I had heard some good things about Lenmar nimh batteries about two years ago - but had bought another brand. This time around, with the good price on Amazon, I gave these Lenmar batteries a try. I ordered two ten-packs. Only 4 out of 20 batteries would accept a charge. I tried an Energizer charger, a LaCrosse BC-900 charger, and a RipVan100 Lightning Pack 4000N charger. The LaCrosse is a high-end charger, including diagnostics on batteries (voltage, etc., displayed for each battery). None of these would charge 16 of the batteries - even in the 'recovery' modes available on the RipVan and LaCrosse. Returned the batteries to Amazon."
2,Not very good batteries,I bought a set of these and 4 batteries were dead in a few months with no much use. I also bought a Lenmar for my digital camera that holds half of what it used to hold. The original battery that came with my camera almost holds the same charge as when it was new. I honestly don't think Lenmar makes good quality batteries. I am not planning on buying Lenmar again.
4,No assault with this battery.,"I purchased these and charged them all two at a time with my newly acquired Sony Super Quick Charger (Model#BCG-34HE)featuring voltage and temperature monitoring functions. (Which, by the way, recommends only using Sony brand AA and AAA Ni-MH batteries. Yeah, right. I guess I'm just a DC rebel.) And they all took a charge without a problem. I'm 10 for 10. No dead cells.Was this review helpful to you?"
2,Frustrating,Fortunatly this soundtrack does not really feature Brian Mays smothered and usually weak vocals but the composings mostly nothing special and dialogue from the film ruins Brian Mays first attempt at a soundtrack as well.
2,Great expectations that are not met,"Ed Bonja has unequalled acess to his subject Elvis Presley. His ""uncle"" was Presley's manager Colonel Tom Parker. Many of Bonja's photographs (the better ones) were used on record sleeves and tour merchandise--the rejects (the lousy ones) seem mostly to comprise this book.Blurred, dark,unflattering,etc. The presentation also leaves alot to be desired. In fact at least one full-page photo is presented TWICE. A great possibility shortchanged. Most people I know agree.Still, there are a few images that are grand, simply because it's Elvis."
3,NOT the swedish death metal band,"Just to warn you, this is ANOTHER band called Dimension Zero. You would think this band would have been sued by the swedish band already..."
1,Very poor book on money markets,"This is an over-rated book on money markets and I recommend ""Business Finance"" by Higson instead, much better approach and clarity."
1,Don't waste your money.,I actually rate this book as absolutely ZERO stars. There is ACCURATE information available!
1,terrible,I bought it off Amazon when it came I opened itTried to use it and it did not work it is a waste of money not worth the price
5,"Choose Mexico for Retirement, 9th","Very informative,organized and succinct. Answered my questions. I can't wait to visit several more recommended Mexican towns. I will take advantage of their recommended websites and seminars too."
2,checklist on top of Checklist,"If you are looking for a fairly comprehensive set of lists, this is it. I was expecting and hoping for a lot more"
3,"Starts Slow, Finishes Fast!","The story moves very slowly at first because it's so disjointed and too many characters are thrown into the mix at once. Although it is very hard to follow at first, the plot gains speed about a third into the book.It follows the reminisces of Budoc (Bedwyr) as he bands together with a British girl, Eurgain, a young Saxon, Ceolric, and Gorthyn & Nai, British warriors, against a malevolent Irish renegade, Eremon. Eremon is a nephew of Lleminawg (Lancelot) but becomes the pawn of Vortepor of Dyfed and is enlisted to find the holy ""chalice.""I was finally rewarded after reading a third of the book when it became a genuine page turner. I just wish the beginning third was as exciting as the last two!"
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!! RUN!!!,"I was in FYE one day, and saw this Manson DVD for $15, and of course was overjoyed at my find. I thought this was the amazing ""Birth of the Antichrist"" DVD(which is what it says on the cover, BTW) and bought it eagerly. I got home, and put it in. At first I was only mildly disapointed, as it was (very) low quality video of early Manson, and Spooky Kids. As I watched on my jaw hit the floor as ""Godeatgod"" started to play, a rediculous CGI/ real pictures of space, stars, and the cosmos accompanied it. I watched through the rest of the DVD, and found that this was by far the worst purchase i had made in at least a year. Overall, this DVD is of the poorest quality, in audio, video, and editing, and does a terrible job representing Marilyn Manson the band, and the shock rocker/genius front man by the same name. If you want a good MM DVD, buy the Guns, God, and Government world tour DVD, that it sure to please."
4,Qualitly rare footage worth the price,"I mean if you are looking for a good mix of his songs this is it. It's not all hits, but some older rare stuff too."
1,made me so sick,Allergy md made me so sick. I began taking it two weeks ago and after only 45 minutes I began sweating profusely and vomiting. It also gave me severe diahhrea. All of this lasted about a day. I stopped taking it after the first does and after a few weeks thought maybe I had just come down with a case of the 24 hour flu or something and decided to try it again. Again 45 minutes after I took it I began with the same symptoms and it continued again until I got it out of my system. I may have been allergic to something in it.... it made me bleed out of my rectum.
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS!,"Put the new Cap and Rotor kit in, immediately broke!! Was installed by a professional mechanic, ended up having to run out to Pep Boys later that night to replace it yet again! Still waiting on this company to refund the money back to my credit card!!"
4,My first; definitely not my last Travis McGee,"This was my first Travis McGee novel, and I'm hooked. The plot was just twisted enough to make it interesting, and the writing was clean. The main character (and probably the author) was a little more misogynistic than I'd like, but that may reflect the time it was written (1966). Overall, this was a great read with lots of promise for the other couple dozen Travis McGee's that McDonald's written."
3,THE BOOK IS KIND OF BORING.WITH MORE ACTION IT CAN BE NICE.,THE BOOK IS KIND OF BORING.IT REALLY NEEDS MORE ACTION.I THINK I CAN TELL THE WHOLE STORY IN ONLY TWO LINES.THE BOOK HAS ALSO LOTS OF UNNEEDEND DESCRIPTIONS.
1,"Bought it, tossed it","Bought it, tried it, tossed it, went back to arm-band/pocket type with separate phones."
1,Don't Buy it !!,"I bought this pan last year Aug, it's only one year old, the coating start to come off. I always hand wash this pot, use soft rubber cookware, it still did not work. Just let everybody know, don't waste your money on this one."
5,I got what I expected,"The 4 qt. pan was just exactly what I wanted and expected, just as the other Anolon products that I have purchased. The price was right, also!"
2,Sock mix up,"I have to say my children LOVE Sonic the Hedgehog so I was thrilled to see these cute socks. However, the socks came in 3 different sizes; one of which was too small for my 6 year old. So I am bummed that they weren't all the same size but at least they can each get a pair of Sonic socks."
5,awesome belt,I put this on my 03 dodge ram with the 4.7 liter. my old belt was squeaky and it wasreally starting to get annoyed so I bought this belt after reading some reviews and wow. it got rid ofmy squeaking fit perfectly and I'm so happy now. I can finally hear the radio not the belt
2,Does not fit,"The 4060882 GatorBack belt does NOT fit the 2003 Taurus, 3.0 L engine, too long. Squealing was terrible. The Amazon web site assurred me it would fit. Had to buy a new belt in town right away as I damaged the old. The belt that fits is 4060855. The belt is a great belt, the info was in error."
1,wrong item,"I purchased this belt and waited to long to install it when I did I learn that this is for the non a/c model, at the time it was not described that way, twice amazon got me but I am still loyal to amazon."
3,Not the right belt for a Tundra with A/C.,"I have a 2000 tundra v8 with A/C. Its not the right belt for an A/C Car, this belt fits NON A/C on Tundras, the notes are somewhat hard to make out."
2,Tries too hard to be cool,"I bought this because I like the idea of books about the Bible that appeal to boys instead of Christianity always being about the soft, gentle side of things. I read one page of it to my son and got rid of it. The whole demeanor of it is just trying too hard to be cool and conversational, at the expense of something real and interesting and meaningful. It's not that I have a problem with people doing something fun with books about the Bible (check out Hey! That's Not What the Bible Says! and Mike Thaler's excellent series), there just isn't much substance here."
5,A musical Must Have at any cost.,"If you are a George Duke Fan run,walk,use your computer and purchase this collection NOW or forever hold thy mouse.For the audiophiles like me,the sound quality is mind blowing absolutely DSD digital remastering at its BEST...Amazing...."
1,Neutrality,"This book is a great book for informing the reader about how American Airlines got from the early 70's to the time the book was published. It speaks of how AA conducts its business and how they improved their network and the way business is conducted. With that being said, the book is just a drain on an airlines entusiasts time. The book is very repetative and very biased about American Airlines. This would have been a great book if the author didn't think of AA as the gods of the sky. The book speaks of AA's financial and route problems, but when the author compares the airlines to a competative airline, AA was always doing things better then the competition. No company is perfect, but I don't know why the author has to justify everything that AA has done wrong."
4,Pink Kone,"The Kone was a gift for my sister-in-law. She had asked for a pink one, I looked everywhere, no pink colored ones available. I found it on Amazon! She loved it!"
5,A must for quick cleaning,"Not only is this cute it works great for pet cleanup, especially cat litter. Would recommend to any pet household that wants to be able to leave a hand vac out without the look of an ugly vaccuum."
4,"Love the look, decent performance","I got a pink Kone vac for my daughter's room. She has a pet parakeet and the thing is always getting feathers and seeds everywhere. I figured this item would help us keep her room cleaned up on a daily basis without having to take out our full sized vacuum every time. I am happy to say that it works very well for this purpose. It looks great and really blends nicely with the ""decor"" of her room. In terms of suction, I would say it is comparable to any other handheld vac, not the greatest but fine for small jobs. Overall I am very pleased with the product."
3,Typical but stylish hand vac,"Look other dirt devil hann vacs, this lacks much power and the filter needs to be cleaned frequently, but its ok for small jobs on occassion and look nice."
4,10 Years & Counting. Strong Signal.,"This baby monitor has been working for us for more than 8 years. My oldest (of the 3) is now 9. We did not buy it new; it was passed on to us by a family friend.The monitor can be switched to either A or B channel. It has a rotary volume control on the side.Pros:- I have to credit the length of service of the baby monitor with us.- Very simple to operate.- Strong signal- Durability. We dropped both transceiver and receiver a number of times- Plug-on or battery powered.Cons:- We hear other households, meaning they also hear us. (Although that tells you how strong the signal is)."
1,Do Not Buy,I have had 3 of those monitors and each has broken down in one way or another. Sure you can call Fisher Price or Mattel to have it replaced but their policy on replacement parts (monitor or receiver or cords)is non existent! They guarantee for one year from the date of purchase not from the replacement date. Graco is a better company and a better monitor.
1,Serves its purpose but bells and whistles are annoying,"I think Fisher Price has overblown it on this one. Lets just get the basic I can hear my baby from far away rooms in the house problem solved and forget signal lights, code-scrambling and alarms. If I were you shopper, I'd buy the basic transmitter-monitor product and save the dough. That being said - we own this one and it works just fine and has lasted in a durable way for many months. Fisher Price does have the basics down but appear to be abusing the line-extension approach to marketing its products."
2,Great monitor!,"I really like this monitor. It is extremely sensitive and doesn't have an annoying hum like some less expensive monitors. The homes in my neighborhood are pretty close, so I really appreciate the privacy feature. I highly recommend this monitor."
3,"One of the best monitors available, but not advanced enough!","Considering how horrible the selection is these days for choosing a quality baby monitor that doesn't transmit to anyone and everyone who may be listening in, intentionally or unintentionally, this seems to be one of the best choices to make. Your scrambled voice will sound like Donald Duck on a regular analog 46-49 mhz cordless phone or radio scanner, so it's at least a moderate roadblock for the average signal interceptor. However, why on earth there is no 900 mhz (or higher) digital-spread-spectrum baby monitor on the market is beyond me. So, this unit is one of the better compromises out there, and at ... on amazon.com, it is amazingly affordable."
3,It's O.K.,"They just don;t make them like they used to. The new model is JUNK!, compared to the one I bought in 1976 for my first child."
4,Perfect Size for a Cruise!,"I just came back from a 7 island (San Juan, St. Thomas, Tortola, Dominica, Martinique, Barbados, St. Kitts on Carnival) cruise of the Caribbean and I found this book to be the most practical guide of the 3 that I took with me. The maps are good and the advice on beaches was helpful. This is a book that you can take onshore with you in your backpack. It serves as a good intro, but of course you'll have to find other sources for more in-depth coverage of culture and history. What I found to be a huge surprise on my cruise was that almost all of the excursions that were offered by the ship were available as you got off the dock from private suppliers for a good 30% off the cruise price. The risk is very small and after a few ports almost everyone that I talked to went on their own privately arranged tours instead."
3,"Small and light on info, but decent overview","I bought this book expecting a good overall look at the Carribean ports of call. Found it to contain mostly the same info and scanty maps as the other guidebooks, but the small size made it worthwhile to take on board with me."
3,Not African Enough,"As a student of African American history, literature, and religious material, I was excited to purchase and read this book. It provided good material for church growth, but failed to demonstrate how African American church growth is distinctive, as the title suggested. It seemed that this book was written as a church growth book, and renamed for the purpose of selling to an African American market. I was disappointed that many of the truly distinctive elements of African American worship, ministry, and preaching were not high-lighted. I'm not talking about trite stereotypes, but about rich tradition, passion and enegergy. I would recommend this book for students of church growth, of any race or culture, but if one is looking for African American distinctives (as I was) he or she will be disappointed."
4,return to form for Big John,"Whether you are new to John Martyn, or a fan, I recommend this album. Martyn, who began as a folkie way back in '67, has traveled throughout the years in jazz, reggae, blues and other styles in crafting his own unique brand of music. Here (and in the recent ""Church with One Bell""--also recommended) he employs some ""trip-hop"" elements but never loses his signature sound-- sax-like vocals, piercing guitar, and sensitive lyrics of love and loss. Highlights include ""Wildflower,"" ""So Sweet"" and an incredible cover of Julie London's ""Cry Me A River."" John Martyn is unique, and if there were any justice in the world (there clearly is not) he would be much more famous than he is. Perhaps this will bring him some new fans."
2,Misleading at best,"This book may be titled Marine Force Recon, but it spends very little time talking about what it's like to be a Force Recon Marine. The selection process and training only receive bare-bones detail; the majority of the book is spent discussing the Marine Expeditionary Unit and its variants, as well as the equipment used by the Marines. As such, it reads more like a Cliff's Notes version of Tom Clancy's Marine rather than an in-depth guide to Force Recon.It would be nice if there was a book written about Force Recon selection and training that was on the same level as Dick Couch's ""The Warrior Elite"", which focuses on Navy SEALs. Given the fact that most people don't even know that Force Recon exists, however, makes such a book unlikely. Anyone who wants to learn more about this unit has really no other option other than to read Bruce Norton's ""Force Recon Diary."""
4,An excellent alternative reality and science novel,"A classic novel from Brunner, dating from the 60s. This is an interesting tale that starts in 'modern' Spain, where the Reconquista and the Siglo de Oro never ended with Spain's bankruptcy and fall from world domination. Science has taken a completely different path, and technology revolves around time travel. The protagonist is a member of the time police. He is sent to the Americas to investigate disturbing suspicions that renegade time machines are being built and used to attack the Monarchy.For as old as the novel is, it doesn't feel very dated. The fact that elements of history and alternate reality are thrown into the mix certainly helps. But, the story moves along quickly, the investigation is interesting, and the world that Brunner created is well-imagined. I think this novel stands up very well to many of the more well-known 'classics' from the time period."
1,"Messy, messy, messy!","I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas and wish I would have known how messy this is. When you grind the beans, the grounds leak out. When you remove the container, the grounds get everywhere. And forget about cleaning it. The area where the grounds come out is atrotious to get clean. Lastly, the container that holds the grounds is already cracked. I am only using it now because it costs so much money that I feel I have to justify the cost by using it as much as I can. I am very disappointed with this product."
3,Book purchase,"Book was in good condition. A little worn but still very servicable. Overall, satisfied with purchase."
3,Locked in,"Very nice hook, but my god, it costs a lot! but I already has the rack it fits so I shelled out the extra $20 to make it look nice with more hooks."
3,Functional,"Works well, but I thought I was ordering a set of them. Be aware that you are only ordering a single hook. Seems a bit overpriced. Necessary for pans thought."
3,"Does the job, but at a price","I have to say, the extender does do the job...it will get you closer to the thing you want to capture, but the quality just isn't so great. It turned my 70-200mm 2.8L IS into a much much lower quality lens. The price is right, so if you don't care too much about the quality loss, this is the way to go. For me, I'm returning the extender to get the Canon 100-400 4.5-5.6L IS. Lots more money, but I think it's worth it."
5,Canon 2x extender,"The attachment, which goes between the camera and lens, in this case doubles the focal length. A 200mm lens would now becon a 400mm lens. Two f stops are lost through this process.There is also a 1.4 extender which works in similar fashion. Borh are useful to you, the photograher.The alternative to using extenders is to get the log range lenses which becomes very expensive."
2,A Chris Rock quote comes to mind..,"You can use the 2x TC to double your reach, you can also drive a car with your feet, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea.In a nutshell, there is no cheap magic bullet that will give you high quality photos of distant subjects at half the distance, and still provide AF. (lookup digiscoping).PROS : Well built, does what it promises, brings objects twice as close.CONS: makes your images dark, and soft that no amount of Photoshopping can adequately correct.I basically out foxed myself by buying this one. I spent $300 to learn why people spend $6,000 on those big Canon telephoto lenses.The 1.4 TC is much better."
4,Effective,"What a great little piece of kit. It's great with my EF 70-200mm f/4L. The only drawback is you've no AF. You are forced to use manual focus. Now this isn't a big problem, unless you're photographing wildlife or moving objects. Well worth the price though and very useful."
4,2X extender EF,The extender lives up to the Canon reputation. The only thing I do not likeabout it is the fact that the autofocus only works with lenses that open up to 2.8. The pictures I have been taking with my L-series lenses are sharp and crisp.
1,Makes a 70-200 f/2.8L lens into a very disappointing lens,"Was expecting the reduction in aperture, but not a reduction in focus! Is so bad that after reviewing a days of shooting in Krugar park we never used the extender again. The other setup used my 70-300 IS DO USM which produced better telephoto pictures than the the 70-200 f/2.8L with the 2x extender - without the extender the reverse is true. Also for those looking for confirmation this Canon 2x extender does not work with the 70-300 DO, mechanically won't allow it due to the position of the innermost lens :( Am told a third party extender (Kenko 1.4) does work with the DO lense, which will be a much more pleasant to travel with ;)"
2,EF 2X II Extender,The jury is still out on this one...image quality is not really where I expected it to be.
2,Don't buy if you have a Digital Rebel and use Auto Focus,I have a Canon Rebel XTi with a 70-200mm telephoto lens. The extender does its job but doesn't operate the telephoto lens' auto focus.
1,READ THE FINE PRINT,"I recently purchased the canon 100-400mm L series with auto focus and image stabilazation. Amazon had the extender come up as a recommended buy. The problem is that the extender requires a lens with a 2.8 f stop for the auto focus to work. I tried using the extender withou the auto focus and found it almost impossible to get a clear picture. I'm sure the extender would work well with any of the canon $7000-$10,000 professional telephoto lenes, but not with the 100-400 L series zoom."
3,"Gets you closer, but at a cost","The longest lens I own is a 70-200mm f/2.8, so this accessory turns it into a 140-400 f/5.6, which is handy when shooting wildlife. The problem is that the keeper rate goes way down when I use it, as the autofocus becomes slower and the picture quality takes a bit of a dive. Being a sharpness freak, I only pull this out in dire need. The 1.4x has much better picture quality, and I still get an effective length of about 100-280mm, which isn't bad."
3,great tool to reach out and get that shot,great tool to add to L series lenses. Softens edges a bit and has some trouble focusing. Used mine on my canon 70-200 is 2.8 lens. Nice addition that is not too expensive.
4,Simply put...it performs to expectation!,"I have only used this Extender outdoors so far to photograph my 14 year old son's football game. Simply put...it performed to my expectation and beyond. I saw no loss of quality with these pictures. I sat in the bleachers and was able to zoom in to actually see the player's faces clearly. So far, I am very excited about this lens extender and the possibilities with football and baseball games."
4,Great addition to my EF 70-200 L f/4 !!!,"This high quality extender is a great addition to my Canon EF 70-200 L f/4 !! With a top-notch build quality and a tough, weather resistant design equal to that of their highly respected line of ""L"" lenses, Canon has produced a great product for its unbeatable zoom lens !! Although the 2X extender renders the A/F function useless on many Canon cameras, I found this to be a Very small drawback overall ( I prefer to manually focus under many of my shooting conditions). This extender is more suited for a low f/number lens due to the 2-stop change in brightness, but it is still VERY effective with my f/4 in normal lighting. A lightweight and fairly inexpensive way to double your focal length, while maintaining the incredible optical quality of the main lens...My backpack will always contain my 2X and 1.4X extenders !!"
3,Double Your Reach for a Cost,"Make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of L series lenses are compatible. If you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition. The AF only works with lenses f/2.8 and faster on most camera bodies. You do also give up image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body. When using longer telephoto lenses with this, you will want to use a tripod, cable release, and mirror lockup in all but the brightest of conditions. If you need this much extra reach you may be better off getting a 1.6X camera body or saving up for a longer lens."
5,Extend your power,"I was excited when the extender arrived. I was prepared to dedicate an afternoon to use it with my telephoto. So I unpacked attached to my telephoto and Voila! It was great, simple as that.I was surprised the easy of use and the great images I made with it.One thing, you really need to use a tripod, even for a steady hand. Othewise the added weight to your lens will render in blurred pictures."
2,2x Extender used with my 70-200 f2.8L,Of all of my Canon Products I have to say that I'm disappointed with this 2x extender. With my 70-200 f2.8L I have not been able to get a clear hand held or even monopod shot. Also my autofocus on my 40D doesn't work unless I'm zoomed out first and then zoom in. I thought this would eliminate my need for a 400mm lens however this combined with arguably the best Canon lens is no replacement for a 100-400 f5.6L.Once I upgrade to a full frame camera body I'll give it another try and hope for the best.
5,Excellent with 70-200 2.8 IS II,I bought this specifically to complement my EF 70-200 2.8 IS Mk 2. I use it with EOS 40 D which is 10 MP ASP-C sensor. If there is a quality degradation from using the extender I cannot see it on my camera. Maybe on the higher pixel density cameras it is more noticeable. The focus speed is lower than with the bare lens but still is pretty quick. I uploaded a picture of a water landing seagull. See for yourself.I bought the extender for one specific project with the intent to sell it later but after using it I decided to keep it indefinitely.
4,Acceptable for my needs,"I use this with my 70-200mm 2.8 IS lens. I get ""acceptable"" results, because I lose a little in sharpness and a couple of stops, but it is a much cheaper solution than buying a 400mm dedicated. For the price this is a good value."
1,Autofocus does not work with XTi body!,I did not find any information regarding the incompability between the Extender and my XTi body. According to email received from canon it really do not work.Be careful before you buy it!
1,Poor Quality,"This isn't the most expensive purchase but regardless it was a waste of money. Additionally, Dependable Resources didn't pack with any bubble wrap which I submitted a poor feedback for the vendor to Amazon. FOR SOME REASON, poor feedback doesn't show up on their vendor scorecard. interesting?"
1,Didn't fit my lens,"I ordered this because it looked like just what I wanted. When it arrived I found that while it did fit my camera as advertised, it didn't fit any of the lenses I have. On the instruction sheet that came with it there was a short list of lenses it would fit. This information was not on the ad. However, I checked at Adorama, where I usually by cameras, and it wasn't there either. No fault for the vendor, but it was still useless to me. On the other hand the return was handled quickly. My refunded was posted to my account in just 2 days. Good job!"
1,Canon EF 2X II Extender,"A big disapointment. Doesn't fit most of my lenses. I should have done my homework befor buying this. Image quality is very poor when coupled w/ canons 100/400mm lens. With all the good equipment canon makes, I expected more."
1,"Only works with Canon 1D, auto focu will not work with any other Canon DSRL","Only works with Canon 1D, auto focu will not work with any other Canon DSRL"
2,"Hawkwind - 'Codename Hawkwind,Vol. II:Live From The Darkside'","First off,I'd like to say that I am really tired of seeing this SAME title released over and over ...and freaking OVER!People!For those of you who may not know,it's the SAME disc that we old school Hawkfans know as 'Bring Me The Head Of Yuri Gagarin'(see my review).I've actually seen online reviews of this release from fans that APPEAR not to realize as to WHAT this CD title is.Only reason I'm giving it a two-star review instead of one,is because of the artistic cover.So FOR completists,it's almost painful."
2,This is just Bring Me The Head Of Yuri Gagarin reissued,"So check other reviews under that listing. Yes, it has some good songs. Yes the sound is terrible. Recorded on a portable recorder by someone in the audience the clapping in time and background noise is a real distraction on Silver Machine.NEW NOTE- May 2006: This concert has just been remastered and reissued IN FULL as 'Empire Pool Wembley 1973'. It still has an annoying humm through most of the concert that I would think could have been digitally removed but it is a somewhat better sounding CD than this one. Plus it includes 8 more tracks including a personal favorite, Seven by Seven."
4,Very Cool Item,Received on time and was exactly how the company described. They were actually bigger than I thought they would be which is great. Cannot wait to use them for my next occasion and will order again from this company.
4,Yeehaw!,"This is a charming book. It's full of rip-roaring barnstorming stories, spanned across the decades to present a nicely rounded view of the era. It's also glib, fun, and more than little informative. It strikes just the right tone for a collection of real-life tales about carefree, adrenaline-addicted sky gypsies."
5,Overcame my fear of large online purchases!,My transaction was quick and informative. I'm now more prone to make purchases through Amazon if not any other site.
5,Excellent Book,The Roswell High books are excellent and the t.v show is awesome too. I tune into the show every week and try to get all the books.
4,"Quick, easy read for those rainy days","The TV show sucks. The books do not. They're not great literary masterpieces but they're good for a quick and entertaining read when you just can't be bothered with Stephen King or Jane Austen anymore. And also, Brendan Fehr on the cover makes great eye candy...the same cannot be said for Max. I liked Cameron, I wished that she could have stayed."
4,There's a very evil control freak out there ...,"Something is controlling Adam - using his body. ""Ray took something that didn't belong to him. I have to get it back,"" the controlled-by-something-evil Adam responds when Adam's friends tell him that something's wrong with him. Soon Adam isn't the only one controlled by Whoever. Isabel is hurting people that she would never hurt if she was in control of herself. Max, Liz, Maria, Michael, Cammeron and Alex have to figure this out, pronto. Or else . . ."
5,Roswell.....Book 6 As Good As Others,"The Stowaway was as good as the rest of the Roswell books, ifnot better. When Adam and Isabel are taken over by some sort of evilit's up to Liz, Max, Michael, Maria, and Alex. When they find out that Elsevan DuPris is the evil force, they decide that they HAVE to get rid of him. With page-turning suspense this book is one of the best in the series"
4,LiftBox Lift,"Purchased Television lift w/cabinet a year ago and have been very pleased with operation. The LiftBox remote, however, got damaged and I have been trying unsuccessfully to locate on line a replacement. In going on the LiftBox (Amazon) web page I was directed to other products made by LiftBox and found remote garage door openers but not remote TV lift openers. Same technology, will these work? I prefer to replace the one I have with a like LiftBox opener. Can you help me?"
1,liftbox customer service,"I have a Liftbox unit in a Hooker cabinet. The remote is cheap and right now does not work. I have tried contacting Riverwood Casual which sells the Liftbox at 2 different numbers and an email (lcross@riverwoodcasual.com). No one has called and no one has answered my email. These numbers and this emailare supposed to be the contact numbers for Liftbox technical support.I am going to make sure I call technical support before I buy something. If you are thinking of buying a Liftbox,you might want to try calling before you buy. 1-888-634-3678"
2,Disappointing,"Another work disfigured by the inability to tell the difference between conventional liberal politics and the Christian worldview. I am sick to death of Brits like Bauckham and N.T. Wright going on about the ""ambiguous American empire."" It reminds me of the old quip about the Holy Roman Empire being neither holy, nor Roman nor an empire. America is neither an empire nor ambiguous, and the current ""international order"" or ""community of nations"" they are talking about isn't the nation created by the Founders. Englishmen like John Winthrop founded America on the purely Deutoronomist basis of creating in a new land a Christian republic. That Bauckham views this as just another discredited Enlightenment project shows that he doesn't understand the country and maybe he should leave out discussions of it in the books he writes."
5,Extra! Extra! Read all about it!!! Christmas After All!!!,"Christmas After All is a great book because it is so funny, mysterious, and a heart warming book. This book takes place during The Great Depression. Minnie, short for Minerva lives with her sisters Lady, Gwen, Clem, and later Willie Faye. She also lives with her brother Ozzie. I think it is cool because their house is still there. I think this book is good for young readers. I could read the book 1,000,000,000,000 times and not get tired of it. I enjoy this book alot. This probly the best book I have read in my whole life!"
3,Pretty Good,"This book, about a girl living through the Great Depression, captures the era marvelously. However, I found that it lacked that ""zing"" that some of the Dear America books posess. I enjoyed it, and it did not bore me. The ending was predictable, but it was well written. I do recommend it."
5,Memories of childhood,"This brought back many memories of growing up and hearing about how this wonderful family coped with the Depression. Also, the Polish customs was very pleasurable to read."
4,Nice!,"I liked this book. All the Dear America books have pictures and historical facts at the back, which is really nice. The book really captures the personality of Minnie, so you can almost imagine that she's talking strait to you. There are some parts that might not be good for small children with rampant imaginations, like when Mr.Otis shoots himself (not in the same room as minnie, and it's not to detailed, but still), But I'd say it'd probably be okay for a ten or eleven year old to read. Over all a good read with lots of interesting stuff from the '30s."
5,Wish I had invented it the Infinity Strap - great DVD!,I am married to a yoga instructor. I am not flexible like she is. This DVD is excellent. Buy the Infinity Strap and get the DVD. Fantastic combination and it is like having a yoga studio at the house with the best gear. I've seen a ton yoga videos and classes. This was done really well and is enjoyable for advanced and beginners. I put this up there with the BEST.
3,melitta coffee mill,"It grinds well and has the choice of various grinds and the price is right. The drawback is the transparent container that has the habit of cracking too easily and it always seems to be in the back corner so it spews out fine coffee unless I hold my finger over the hole. This purchase today will be the 3rd one, since I can't seem to get a hold of Melitta to get just the replacement cup."
1,I second that,"Am looking for replacement plastic container because like the others, mine has cracked and there are coffee grounds everywhere. Will likely just get out the old standby Braun; less sophisticated because it has no measuring capabilities but not such a mess and still in one piece."
2,Blunt,"I've had my grinder for about 2 years & managed to only crack the plastic holding cup. Drinking espresso, I keep the grinder on a fine setting & have had to gradually set it finer to keep the grounds the right size. I'm now on the smallest setting & the grounds are still too big. I don't think I'll bother ordering a replacement or buying another one of these.Spend a bit more & get something that will last."
3,Not very durable,"The plastic receptical is surprisingly fragile. Accidentally dropping the container or even knocking it to dislodge the grinds is enough to cause it to chip and crack. Replacements of plastic parts (if you can find them) is expensive. I found that the grinding blade became dull rather quickly (also an expensive replacement) and the coffee beans were heated during the grinding process. The effect of this heating was noticeable in the final flavor of the coffee (hey... if youre going to buy expensive beans, you want to enjoy them!). Finally, my grinder lasted for less than 2 years, with moderate use. Some sort of an electrical short. The cost to repair the problem was more than the expense to buy a new one!"
5,A Great Debut Album!!,"This is, hands down, one of the best smooth jazz debut albums I have heard in ages. These fellas from Portland, OR are a class act all the way. Their opening song ""N-Touch"" gives every member of the group a chance to shine. The vocals on ""Time Will Tell"" add a dimension to this album that most smooth jazz artists are unable to match. The Latin rhythms on ""Hasta Luego"" are outstanding segueing into the funky, upbeat ""Sweet Potato Pie."" My absolute favorite cut on this album though has to be the closing track, ""Coming Home."" It wraps you in its arms and caresses you with its mellowness. It feels like a bowl of hot soup on a winter day or a soak in a hot tub after a long day at work. Everything about this album is a pleasure to hear. I predict this is the first of many cd's from this amazing group. Jump on the bandwagon now. Don't be left behind."
4,Day of the Diesels definately needs an age appropriate heading,"The movie is really good but definately geared to a little older child than my 1 yr old who does not like the mean look of the diesels but loves the tank engines. He sees the diesels and takes of screaming. Things nightmares are made of. The movie is good, the story line is good, the production is great. Just make sure your child is a little older before you get this one."
5,Thomas & Friends: Day of the Diesels,Bought as a gift for my grandsons. They love anything that has to do with Thomas. When this movie is playing they are glued to the television.
5,this one is good,this is a good movie for all thomas fans!an enjoyable and attention keeper.if you want movie instead of segments this one is good
3,Weird plot - wonderful graphics,"Plot in a nutshell: Diesel trains conspire against steam trains to invade their sheds. To do that, they trick, trap and imprison steam trains. Then they make peace and become friends. That is really what happens in the movie. Sounds weird but they executed the movie in such a beautiful way that my daughter could not stop talking about it for weeks. Yes, at the end friendship and mutual understanding wins but the scenes where Thomas was not let go by the diesels were somewhat inappropriate and unnecessary. I would recommend this movie overall, but watch it with your child(ren) for the first time and decide for your self if you feel comfortable with some scenes that might be stressful to some children (minus one star). I am also not amused with the fact that all conspirators/ill willed trains had a heavy accent (minus one star). I am not sure what kind of subconscious message that would give to small children."
1,Old Thomas,"The stop motion and sets are beautiful, but the stories are pretty negative and the engines are cranky with sad and angry faces most of the time. I'm sticking to the new CGI versions from now on. But I'm not sure what year that transitioned exactly.Also the time length of videos is very deceiving. I had to fast-forward through a lot of ads and ""propaganda"" if you will, before getting to the actually videos themselves. There is a lot of useless footage of people/kids talking about how they love Thomas. We get it already! That why we bought the videos!"
3,Another good episode collection,"This is another good collection of birthday related Thomas episodes. While the Mr Perkins interludes are sometimes amusing, I prefer the railway line segues that you get when the episodes air on PBS. If you're looking to watch just a couple of quick Thomas stories before nap or bedtime, this is a good collection."
4,What's the big deal???,"My son is 2 and loves this DVD! He's a huge Thomas fan and would watch Day of the Diesels all day, every day, if we would let him. He doesn't find it the least bit scary at all! Is Percy whiny? Yes! Is Diesel 10 devious? Yes! But it's a cartoon. We grew up watching a desperate cayote try in vain to catch a roadrunner and turned out just fine!"
5,Lots of Thomas & Friends!,"This box set is perfect for Thomas & Friends both old and new. My boys just recently got into Thomas so they haven't seen really any of the older episodes which this box set has discs ranging from 2001-2008. Each disc has episodes focusing on a certain character or just the best of! There are over 50 episodes total and each disc is between 40-60 minutes long. Luckily my boys aren't too picky yet and love all the engines equally, but for kids who are specific or especially families with two kids who like different engines, this would be a great set. The episodes are classic Thomas & Friends episodes and I love that there are so many episodes in one set! For just $24 on Amazon, that is like $.50 an episode that you can watch over and over again!"
4,A bit scary for the younger viewers,"My son is 3 and normally loves the Thomas movies (Misty Island, Hero of the Rails), but this movie was a bit scary for him. I think it's Diesel 10 and his sparking claw that really scared him. I had to turn it off and try it again later. We eventually got through it, but he doesn't want to watch it again (unlike Misty Island and Hero of the Rails which we've seen a lot). The quality was really good, but it was a bit darker than the other movies. If you have a 2-3 year old, you may want to wait until their older."
1,Too Scary!,My grandson actually had nightmares after watching this. He trembles at the sight of the package cover. It's not the story itself that is scary to him. Not the fire. It is the sinister and scary character Diesel 10 and his giant snapping claw! I would not recommend.
5,DVD Review,"Thomas learns his lessons, as does the rest of the cast and crew of Thomas and Friends. This is another Mr. Perkins video. I think I like him because he reminds me of Mr. Rogers. Nevertheless, this is another great video, highly recommended."
4,Wonderful DVD set,"My husband and I were impressed with the 6-disc set of Best Tales on the Tracks. It is our first DVD of Thomas the Tank Engine. We use a Blue-ray player and although the DVD is not Blue Ray, the picture and sound quality are very good. We also like the story lines. Our daughter is 2 1/2 and loves Thomas the Tank Engine books, iPhone apps, and Duplo set. However, she is rather sensitive and it really upset her to see the trains on the DVD crash or get dirty. She doesn't even want to watch the DVD and says ""no"" if we try to play it. We are putting it away and will try again when she is a little older."
2,Should have been called Percy Goes to the Dark Side,"This movie was WAY to dark for the age of the children that normally watch the Thomas DVD's! Luckily, my son is almost 5 now so he was not as scared as he would have been a couple of years ago. The Diesels are like the evil Emperor, Darth Vader, and other dark characters from Star Wars, especially Diesel 10 (who lures Percy into the Dieselworks). I agree with other reviewers that it was disappointing to not hear from some of the regular Thomas characters and I'm glad I just rented this one and didn't waste my money buying it."
2,Disappointed,"My son is a Thomas and Friends fanatic. He has everything Thomas and was looking forward to getting Day of the Diesels for Christmas. He loved Hero of the Rails and Misty Island Rescue! However, this movie is a bit scary for 4 year olds in my opinion. I watched it with him the first time after reading some reviews that is was a little scary and sure enough, they were right! I think it teaches kids the wrong message too, that it's ok to lie, trick, and decieve others. It may be ok for your child if you watch it with them and explain to them that what is happening and how it is wrong. My son watched it twice and hasn't asked to watch it again. He watched Misty Island Rescue literally 30 times initially after getting that one. Point is, this movie is not age appropriate and is a disappointment coming after Misty Island Rescue."
1,Such a shame,"We were really let down by this. After watching either Hero of the Rails or Misty Island on an almost daily basis, we were all ready for DOTD to arrive. Both my three and two year olds were scared by the fires and by Diesel 10. They liked Belle and Flynn, but that's it. Percy is ridiculous in this movie and we had to explain why he was acting like a wanker. And then we have to explain being devious and lying and tricking one another - all conversations we had zero interest in having with the kids at their age.Such a shame because we're all such fans of the Thomas line."
1,Full of terrible concepts,"My 3 yo son loves his toy diesel engines, he doesn't want to perceive of them as evil and deceptive. He's never been disturbed by a movie before and yet he was by this one; he asked me to turn it off. It's ridiculous anybody thought this was a good story for young children. For young children something negative may be portrayed as a ""lesson"" to learn but in seeing that behavior in the first place a toddler-age child will emulate it so I don't want my kid seeing examples of evil and in this case in this film, potentially murderous (the fire) behavior AT ALL. At 3 years old he doesn't need to know that exists. When he's mature enough to filter it and understand it as he should THEN he can watch it. In general I really don't like the Thomas the Tank Engine stories. They're so weirdly negative."
4,Good Collection,"A very good collection. A little disappointing not to see ""Go, Lovely Rose"" included and there are a couple of alarming misprints (""Now sleeps the crimson petal, NOT the white""). I wasn't a huge fan of the Finale typesetting either, but it's easy enough to read. It is great to see the best of Quilter's excellent songs assembled so conveniently and for such a low price. A must-have for the library of any serious young singer and probably a good purchase for a repiteteur or teacher."
5,Michigan Swing Dance Association!,"The last part of the trilogy of Cathy Jean is another sensational album that I think you may like best of all. It has at least four or five wonderful dancing tunes as well as several great listening songs. Again she rocks with her voice and guitar. If you don't get the feel with ""Strut"", you're just not paying attention. ""Ms. Jeneration Hip Zone"" has that Latin Funky sound now so popular with the West Coast Dancers. There's much more to offer on this CD. Be sure to get this for yourself for many hours of pleasure! --Bob Budzynski"
5,This CD is GREAT!!!,"I'm very happy. I can honestly say that out of blues artists I've heard I think Cathy is the best! In my books she's right up there with Janis Joplin for sheer power, emotion & phrasing! Koko & Shemekia look out!"
5,Cathy Jean,"A friend of mine at work turned me on to her C.D.s the other day and I thought, WOW! this girl can sing, play the guitar and she is HOT!!!!!! it's about time."
5,Great Family Movie,"Joshua is an extradinary movie. It's a movie I recommend for the whole family. There are always what if this were true in the world. This movie makes the impossible to the possible. Tony Goldwyn does an excellent job in portaying Joshua, Who is to say that Jesus doesn't come down to visit us from time to time to help us with our troubles? Anything is possible. This is not the Second Coming Of Christ. But it gives us the faith, the hope and the belief that there is another world waiting for us. I saw this movie many years ago. I forgot how much I enjoyed it. I walk away from this movie feeling that love is still capable of being achieved in this turbulent world. I highly recommend all people to watch this movie. Joshua brings the whole community of Auburn together. He leads by example. In the end that is what all of us need to do."
5,Fun to Watch.,"A good story. Fun to watch. Definately recommend renting it. It is not an over-acted, mello-dramatic, cartoonish Christianity Christian film. Instead, it is a good story.Some may disagree with a few theological points in the film, but if you are seekign a perfect Christian film, it doesn't exist."
5,We loved it!,"We had never read the book, let alone heard of Epiphany Films when my wife brought home Joshua from the video store. As a Christian, I am always a little skeptical of Christian films - too many seem under-funded and over-acted. We were pleasantly surprised, however, as we found Joshua to be creative, light, and intriguing. In short, we loved it! After inviting friends to a second showing, we found the response to be overwhelmingly enthusiastic. The film was showed in two parts, and one couple went and rented the film in the meantime because they couldn't stand the suspense! The beginning seems subdued, like Little House on the Prairie, but soon moves into a new realm that is both fresh and inspiring. It left us feeling great, although we did feel we had to forgive a basic theological premise which suggests Jesus might show up on the streets of hometown USA today."
3,Family Movie,"If you are looking to get in-touch with yourself, find stronger meaning to life or a desire to believe in the Almighty, you may enjoy this film. Suitable for the entire family."
4,Interesting movie.,"I get tired of R rated and wanted to watch something with substance. F Murray Abraham was brilliant in this and I enjoyed the concept of the movie. A fascinating glimpse of the contrast between liberal, conservative, loving and oppressive Christians."
5,Quietly Impacting,"A simple, powerful film. If you're looking for all the bells and whistles of a Hollywood movie this is not the movie for you. If you are looking for a gentle story, with a message that will impact your life... Joshua is the winner! Be prepared to laugh, cry and feel your soul reach out to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."
5,Perhaps the most underated movie in history,"This is a GREAT movie.Great acting!Great shots !Great story from the Joshua series of books which are AWESOME.Well produced !.It has all the things movies in recent hisotry do not:- A plot that is followed in logical and well developed sequence to conclusion- Great actors who develop and shape their characters into ""beleivable"" people.Every one of them has fatal flaws in themselves and their lives,but Joshua teahes them to rise above tose foibles and ""become"".- Values, principles and a message that enable human dignity instead of degrading it.I've watched this movie at least 10 times and lent it and re-bought it as many times..While not everyone will see with my eyes or hear with my earsto me this is one of the few MUST HAVE movies for a home library.."
4,great family movie,"This was a great watch! It brings alive the truth and heart of God in Jesus. If you're wanting to be reminded of the heart of our God Jesus, this movie will help. Such a blessing"
4,Joshua,Entertaining for the whole family. I found it to be a feel good and motivating movie. Children and teens like it!
2,Joshua,"I found this film extremely disappointing; it did not compare to the novel. The novel had a sense of mystery; the film did not convey this. It was obvious what was intended but unfortunately the film lacked that magical something. Maybe, it is all in our imagination and novels should not be made into films as they lack so much and after all, it is all a matter of interpretation."
1,If they had a way to make 0 stars I would do that. This stunk!!!!,"After reading the book Joshua, which i thought was AMAZING, I was pretty leery of the movie. Christian movies are usually cheep, cheesy, and poorly acted. This movie was no exception. The only thing it has to do with the book was the title. Joshua the book is very controversial. It deals with all different types of denominations and how Jesus would interact in these denominations. The movie completely skips all of the important parts and just puts filler fluff. Save your money, don't buy this movie and instead read the book it is MUCH better."
4,Almost There!,Joshua is based on the novel written by Joseph F. Girzone. This is just another story to add to the list that the movies messed up. I read the book before I saw the movie and I could not wait to see the movie.I must say though I was very dissapointed when I saw the movie because it just did not go along with what I pictured and did not really even line up with the book.But it really has good morals to it. And I did grow on it. The score (written by Michael W. Smith!) was excellent. I also have the soundtrack and I love it.I cannot really say what the movie is about though because it would ruin the suprise that you get at the end (if you get it at all). But it is a very interesting movie none-the-less.All in all I recommend the book and not the movie. Or watch the movie only after you've read the book. I don't think you will be very dissapointed.
5,Everyone should see it . . .,"The universal message is clear and is delivered in a non-threatening way. People of all ages and backgrounds will be able to understand this simple presentation. Good for many viewings. The dvd offers the fullscreen version, surround sound, and includes the usual extras."
2,Item not received,I have not received this item. I've emailed the seller twice and have had no reple!!
1,Read the Book Instead,"The book on which the DVD is based is extraordinary. The story provides many thought provoking views on the life of Christ and their implications for faith. Plus, it's just an excellent read.It's almost shocking how bad the DVD is by comparison - constant, sappy background music, squeaky clean sets (i.e., unrealistic), and drained of drama. If you dare to watch, please don't let it put you off from reading the book."
5,Joshua,"Fantastic film, Tony Goldwyn is an amazing actor, especialyin parts like this, but one grows stale doing one kind ofrole."
5,A Gift from the lord,"I have watched this movie well over 50 times, though i dont beleive in the church i do beleive in god, this movie i have recommended to others in need weather it be for emotional support or physical pain, it is uplifting, and beautiful. I truely beleive that the actors in this movie at the making were guided by the hand of God, This is a MUST SEE MOVIE....if not a must own movie, one of the nicest aspects of it was all ages can watch it, and get something out of it"
2,enjoyment depends on if you read the book,"If you read the book...don't watch the movie. You'll spend the entire time noticing how different it is from the book. There are very few similarities, and the things that are similar do not go in the same order as the book.I read the book and saw the movie. I like the movie, but not until several days after i saw it. the message is still good, but not as good as the book."
2,The book is always better.,"First, let me say that I've read ""Joshua"" at least 4 times, that's how much I love that story. When I found out that it was being made into a movie, I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately, it has yet to play in my area, so when I learned that it was out on VHS/DVD, I ordered it immediatly. I hoped that it would be very close to the book, unfortunately, it is not. For example, Father Pat, one of the main supporting characters, was portrayed as a bafoon; he is definately not so in the book. Major parts of the story have been totally left out. Other major parts de-emphasized. Still other parts never even appeared in the book. However, I will have to admit that the spirit of the story is still there. Fankly, if I had seen it first in a theater, I would not have bought the DVD. Buy the book, rent the movie."
5,Have Got to See This...,This is a must see movie of the love God has shining through someone. Watching this movie made me want to make sure that I'm there to help others. If you show kindness the smile and love that you get in return is enough reward.
4,touching,"A positive message for a world that often forgets what ""love your neighbor"" means & has slipped into a jaded & judgmental mindset."
3,"Sweet, Well-Intentioned Pabulum","I think this is a kind movie & recommend it for those wanting a simple inspirational message & an uncomplicated approach to Jesus' message of love & how we should all get along. As a devout Catholic, I liked the idea behind the movie (I already knew that Joshua is Jesus' name transliterated from Hebrew while Jesus is transliterated from Greek). After 15 minutes I just couldn't watch it any longer because it came across as so hokey. Jesus is a complicated figure & Joshua was presented as a one dimensional ideal that ignores the many sides of the real Jesus & does not provide a model that represents the real inner struggles & turmoil that people deal with. At Gethsemane, Jesus had some real inner struggles & turmoil that we can turn to in solace. If you want something light & nice but not really substantial or sophisticated, I think this movie is a good choice."
1,WARNING!,"We turned the movie off near the end when it became outright apparent that Joshua was supposed to be Jesus incarnate. As Christians, we were offended by this sacrilegious production. It was very distasteful. You may want to watch this before you let your children watch this, it will only confuse them. Joshua could have been cast as just an ordinary person who served and helped others; he did not have to be portrayed as Jesus in the flesh. Good message, terrible delivery."
1,Joshua - biblically unbalanced,"All religious people are born in sin and are at enmity with God from the womb (Psalm 51:5, Psalm 58:3, Romans 5:10, Colossians 1:21). Before a sinner can ""love God"", he must first be reconciled to God through repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. The gospel of Jesus Christ is for the salvation of each individual sinner (whosoever will - one at a time) and has nothing to do with building earthly ecumenical ""communities"".Except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish, Luke 13:3,6.The Lord is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance, 2 Peter 3:9."
5,Joshua Really Touched Our Hearts,"I saw Joshua in our local movie theater and loved it!! I told all my friends about it. I found that I even had the book in my bookshelf and am in the process of reading it. There are definitely some things different between the book and the movie, however, where can you find an excellent video for everyone in your family to watch and one that really touches everyones' hearts? It definitely is a life changer. :) I bought the DVD AND video so I can go over over my friends to watch it with them. It's been such a blessing. I just watched it yesterday afternoon over a friend's house and there wasn't one dry eye in the house at the end. I would recommend this movie very, very highly!!"
5,Love This Movie!!,"Very moving film!! Enjoyed this very much, no problems with playback. Love is the key to many things and this movie shares that with the viewer. I like it and watch many times."
5,Joshua,"For a movie that was not ""big time"", I was amazed at the number of familiar faces who took part to create this truly inspiring movie! Based on the book by Joseph Girzone, Joshua is an uplifting, heartfelt, humourous presentaion about a lone man who comes to a small town and changes everyone's perspective on love. Through supernatural acts, he causes an uprise in the local church that reaches all the way to Rome.Well acted and well written, I recommend Joshua to anyone who needs a boost of encouragement, hope, and love. Definately one for the records, AND for my DVD collection."
4,Well told,"I don't go in (at all, frankly) for Christian Right movies but, like with Time Changer, this was on Sky and I happened to turn it on. Its actually a well told, moving film. I won't spoil it for you but the protagonist is just about the most famous person who has ever lived!"
5,Promoting Love and compassion,"I saw this movie on the religious channel. I wanted to watch something that wasn't violent or profane. When I saw this movie, I knew that I wanted to buy it and watch it over and over. I'm not a religious person, but this movie, I found was profound in the fact that it demonstrates a behavioral decorum for all who are seeking to be more like Jesus. It demonstrates love and compassion without judgment. No one is judged as bad, even though the behavior is less than kind. It's one of my favorite DVD's. I watch it over and over. It reminds me who I should be. Watch it only if you want to improve yourself and be inspired. The acting was remarkable."
5,What a movie A+A+A+A+AA+,This movie I have purchased two at different times its that great. You will enjoy and you must ask a friend over too watch .It will change you for the better each time you watch it.
5,Outstanding,"Wonderful movie, inspiring, good for the whole family....the ending was high on the goose bump scale. Plan to show it at family movie night at our church"
2,Quite a Disappointment,"If we measure and evaluate everything by the Book, which we try to do, then this movie falls far short of the Jesus (Joshua) we see in the Bible. Just the music itself does not honor the holy character of the Son of God. Rock music is sensual and worldly, and putting Christian words to it does not change it's corrupting character. Also, Joshua sent the young widow the wrong signals. She thought he was interested in her as a woman. Jesus would not have done this. I was moved in certain parts when he healed the blind woman, and raised Theo from the dead ( also healing his speech problem), when he touched the priest, and the Pope. It isn't that there was nothing good, but the fact that Jesus was represented so inaccurately at points was disappointing, and likely to mislead many who see this movie. I strongly encourage everyone who wants to know Jesus to read His Book, and pray for His enlightenment."
5,Joshua,"Pretty decent movie, for a Christian based movie. When I first saw it, I was kind of confussed what the story line will be like. After a while, I notice that everything will be symbolic. very good."
4,Joshua the movie,"""Joshua"" is loosely based on the first of the series of Joshua books written by Joseph F. Girzone. Joshua is a master carpenter who appears in a small town. He is a seemingly ordinary but unusual young man who changes the lives of those whom he meets--Jesus in present-day times. The movie is heartwarming, gently humorous, and touchingly beautiful. F. Murray Abraham gives a masterful performance as Father Tordone."
4,Life-Changing Movie,"I would rate this movie just below ""The Passion"" in the life-changing category. This is not another cheesy Christian film with bad acting. It is a fresh and non-religious look at who Christ was and who we should strive to be. It's not preachy and it's very relevant to the way we all live. See it."
4,Joshua DVD,"This film is very good.Sadly because I have read the book first, I was a little disappointedthat the whole book could not be in the film.People ordering this film should also be aware that it has to be viewedin region 1 when most English DVD players are region 2, luckily I couldview it on my computer screen."
3,Slow Streamming,"The movie was good, once I actually got to see it. For some reason the download on this was slow, and it kept stopping during the stream. I would just think it was my network connection, but I immediately stopped and went to a different movie, and it worked just fine. The problem lies somewhere in this movie, itself."
4,Joshua--very inspirational movie,"I really enjoyed this movie and found it very touching. As a Christian, the movie inspired me and I really felt the love of Christ."
4,Great service.....as usual,"Great service.....as usual. I appreciate knowing the order was recieved OK, and when it was shipped."
4,good movie,"The best reason I can think of for owning this movie is to be able to watch for the little details the second time you watch it that you might have missed. (look for the Challah bread!) My family and I really enjoyed this movie. Some of the parts of the movie were very clever in how they used passages from the bible in the context of this story (for example, ""I am what I am"")."
2,"Nice try, but not Biblically Sound","My biggest problem with the movie is that Joshua (the Jesus Christ character)agrees to make an idol-statue of the apostle, Peter, for the local Catholic church. I realize that the original book was written by a priest, but it's still not Biblically sound.I seriously doubt that if Jesus Christ came to earth now, He would willingly make an idol for people to worship. He didn't do it while He was here the first time, and besides He would be breaking the Commandment ""You shall not make any idols."" (Exodus 20:4)The story line is pretty good, and the acting is OK. But I was disappointed all together with the movie and it's lack of Biblical integrity concerning our Savior Jesus Christ."
2,Not Really Very Good,"Let's face it, if you've read and enjoyed any of the Joshua series, you've also thought that they would translate well to the big screen. Given the relatively short novel that the film is adapted from, it should have been easy to present the story without oversimplification. Not so, I thought this movie was really pretty bad. They have really watered down the message of the book and have made Joshua a ""Christians Only"" hero. They have completely removed the Hebrew element from the book. I also agree with an earlier review that they made Father Pat look like a boob. Complex characters were given sitcom-like personas on film and ulitmately, I feel, the message is buried."
3,"It works, but hurts","This mouthguard does the job for my bruxism, however, it's shape produces a sore mouth in the morning. The upper and lower side ""guards"" that prevent swallowing the whole device actually protrude into your upper and lower gum line, creating some morning soreness. I solved this problem by customizing the device; cutting off these sideguards. So, it's okay, but I'll try a different brand now."
4,"nice and simple, but bulky","I needed to get the knives out of the drawer block I had because our toddler can now reach in the drawer. I have never had a counter knife block before so I didn't realize how deep they are and how much room they take up. I was kind of surprised when I got it, but then I looked and all the others are pretty much the same depth, so I guess it's just me. Is really nice for the price and holds a lot. I got it because it is the only one that holds a full set of steak knives for the price, all the others were at least 30.00 more. Nice wood and finish. overall,does the job for the best price."
5,my knifes are happy,I love this knife block. it holds almost all my knife and the ones thatdo fit are kept sharp
5,Wish list request,"My son researches his wish list items very well. He chose this as the one he wanted. It was perfect, he said."
2,Slots too cramped,"This knife block is handsome and seems to be well-made. However, when it arrived, I discovered that the slots are placed too close together so that the handles of some of my knives end up jammed against the ones just above or below them. I have a set of Chicago Cutlery walnut-handled knives, and maybe my knives are just fat-handled (never seemed overly bulky to me before). I thought about trying to make it work, but ultimately I ended up returning this block for one that offers a little more space between knives."
3,So-so,"First, the pic shows 19 slots but the write up says 20 slots. Didn't know what I was going to get. Said In Stock, but took 15 days to ship with Super Saver.Second, Amazon & J. A. went out of their way not to let me know what the slot sizes are. The one I got fortunately has 20 slots. One for scissors & one for a steel, a 3 1/4"" cleaver slot, 4 - 2"" slots, 2 each 1 3/8"" & 1"" slots, 1 - 1 1/4"" slot and 8 - 3/4"" slots for steak knives.Now, my cleaver won't fit in the cleaver slot, but that isn't a problem because my 10"" chefs knife won't fit in any of the other slots so it has to go in the cleaver slot. My 12"" roast slicer doesn't have a prayer. All the other knives I don't use fit fine.All in all it's a nice block at a nice price. I didn't like wondering for three weeks what I bought.Hilditch"
5,Excelent knife block,The block was just as described. It's very solid and perfect for my Henckels knife set.
1,Terrible workmanship,"I thought I would be ahead of the game because I ordered one of these for my wife three weeks before her birthday, but when the first one came the top corner of the wood block holding the knives were chipped and broken. I returned the first one and ordered a second, still in time to arrive for my wife's birthday. When the second one arrived I did not look at it, because it was the day before my wife's birthday. When she opened it the second one was in worse shape than the other one we returned. The second one was chipped along the top corner and, even worse had a major chip in the middle below where you insert the top row of knives, AND right below that chip there was a large crack. The damages to both of these were NOT due to shipping problems, they were due to sloppy craftsmanship. We had to return the second one as well. After two tries, I'm giving up on this product."
4,Obviously a re-pack but works ok.,"The Henckels 20-Slot Super Knife Storage Block that Amazon sent us is obviously a re-pack of a returned item; the box is old, there's no paperwork, and the knife block itself looks used. Not happy with Amazon.We cleaned it (thoroughly) and it works fine."
4,Good for the price,"I like this block, but it really only has two slots wide enough for Santoku or chef's knives. The other slots are narrower and made more for slicing/carving/bread knives. I have a couple of older and cheaper Chicago Cutlery chef's knives that I store together in the cleaver slot, but they overlap by about 1/4 inch. It is a deep block, meaning it will hold a 9"" blade easily. Overall, for the price...it's a great knife block."
5,Really nice with all sizes of slots.,"I replaced a smaller block with this one and love it. I put my nice peeler in the bottom square hole and my sharpener in the upper left one. Holds ALL sizes of knives and plenty of em.Nancy RectorAuthor of ""A Painful Truth - The Entrapment of America's Sick""(How Being Ill Got Me Arrested)[...]"
4,Just what I needed,I have a collection of great knives - none of them came with a block to store. This has enough slots for all my knives. I have several large chef knives and they all fit.
5,Henckles Knife Block rocks,"Great purchase. Perfect price. Helps me organize the knives to find them fast. Keeps them from cutting anyone paging through a drawer. I had 2 blocks...messy look in the kitchen. This one holds all I usually use and looks so sleek. The block is deep and so it requires more countertop front to back than some blocks do, but the knives can easily be removed without tilting the block or pulling it forward to clear the top cupboards. The price is sooooo good. I hope you like yours too!"
2,"Bad mix of slots, wasted space","After reading all the good reviews and looking at the picture, I thought this would be a great choice for me. Unfortunately, the block only fit two of my larger knives, leaving 4 big knives without a home. Maybe if there were room for 4 or 5 larger knives I would have made due and gotten rid of a redundant knife or two, but as it was, this block is useless.Strangely, there was enough room on the rightmost column of slots that the slots could have been made sufficiently wide for my needs. For whatever reason, they didn't design it for my selection of knives. Oh well.All that said, it seemed like a nice enough block otherwise."
5,Knice Knife Block!,"After looking at several different knife blocks (including the ""ploosh"" type with the plastic rods), my girlfriend and I decided on this one. We have since been very happy with our decision; this knife block feels really sturdy and gets the job done well. Also, one thing I was pleasantly surprised by was the fact that the slits for the knives go all the way through the block, meaning there is plenty of air circulation to allow excess moisture to escape (which keeps the whole thing cleaner and dryer). Two non-severed thumbs up!"
5,Super Knife Storage Block,Great item especially if you bought knives that didn't come with it. Holds all sorts of knives even the sharpener and scissors. Price was reasonable. Shipping was within time they said it would come.
5,Super Knife Block,"This solidly built knife block neatly holds all my large and small knives, the knife sharpener and a pair of scissors. If I had a small cleaver, it would take that as well. Looks great on the kitchen counter."
5,Knife Holder Block,"This product was priced right and it is very handy to have all your knives in one place, not scattered in drawers. Looks very nice sitting on my counter. I do recomment this product."
3,Customer Service,"Goodwill Savannah did not have the ""activation"" code for the game but did refund the cost in a timely manner.Good Job!"
2,This game is old.,"This may have been a great game at one time, but not any more. The controls are lame and choppy. The gameplay is very difficult in some levels where you have no way of not being spotted and wind up getting torn to pieces before you can find a spot to hide from the mob of people shooting at you. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you can get it cheap."
2,More of a work project than a game,"I echo the comments of other reviewers here that this game was not a lot of fun to play. I was looking forward to this after playing the first IGI, and although I had my share of frustrating moments by not having save options it was good overall. Here you get all of 3 chances to save, and it's best to start saving as you go further along. With the slightest misstep you can have 100 soldiers right on you, and you're also an easy target from what literally must be a mile away for enemy soldiers with basic AK-47's. I was ready to throw my monitor out the window so many times I couldn't continue with the game, and I'm an avid gamer that looks forward to finishing each game I play. I'm glad I only paid $10 for this and not the $50 when it first game out. You'd be better off with another game. Huge disappointment for me."
3,Difficult game,"I finished the first level and it wasn't too hard after you understand that stealth is the way to play this game. That is, avoid the guards, cameras and be sure to hide in the shadows. I have begun the second level, going down into the mines, and I have been killed about 20 times now with less than two minutes into the mission. The slightest slip up and you have a dozen guards with automatic weapons all shooting at you. Even killing a guard with the knife is enough to get an instant response from other guards who come rushing from another room.It appears that there may be only about two saves possible per level, so you have to be very wise about when to save the game. Looks like I'll have to buy a hint book for this game.The graphics are excellent. I am running a P4 2.53, 512 MB ram, with a Radeon 9700 Pro with about everything maxed out.I am playing at the medium difficulty level, but will probably have to go to the easiest to stand a chance at finishing the game."
1,Perfect Game for Masochists,"There is a lot wrong with this game - awkward movement, imprecise aiming, idiotic AI, and lots of bugs. However the worse thing of all is that you get the feeling that you are being manipulated.It's like you have no control or real involvement in the game. You simply have to repeat a sequence of move, stop, kill, move, stop, wait... again and again until you hit on the exact sequence the programer predetermined. Making this worse, saves are very limited (3 on the normal level)so frustration quickly sets in.I have reached the 13th level and decided that this was just not my idea of having fun. Now I'm sorry I didn't uninstall it sooner. I could have spent that time playing a good game like Hitman 2, Thief II, SOF 2 or just about any other game."
1,DOES NOT FIT!,"This belt does not fit 2002 Ford F350 V10 6.8L, although they claim it does.It is too short. About 1/2"" too short. Could not get it on with automatic tensioner fully backed up. It was a little short to go over alternator pulley.Luckily, old belt was still in good condition."
1,"Right number, wrong wires","These wires look great, but these were NOT for a Chevrolet Cavalier with a 2.2. WAY to long and there were 5 wires instead of 4... The shortest wire was actually double in length of the OEM wire. These were supposed to be an exact custom fit set. Yeah right! I see the price went up too. Good luck, I hope you get the right wire set. I bought them locally. Paid less for the right wires, too."
2,Just a Toy,"Bought four of these for my family to use while skiing, four wheeling, paint balling and laser taging since they're supposed to cut out ambient noise and still allow you to communicate over the sound of the engine or rushing wind. But I was a bit disappointed with the build quality and VERY disappointed with the sound quality. I sent all of them back. Another thing is that the coiled cord for the remote trigger that you put on your finger in the product photo is NOT the one they send you. In fact, you can't even get that cord from the manufacturer anymore. It comes with just a cheap, plain cord that get's caught on things. Lame."
1,Confusing sequence and typos characterize this book :-(,"Granted; XSLT and XPATH in particular aren't easy to cope with, but I did never find the ""key"" to the sequence of material in this book. Especially XPATH must be covered better, since XPATH are so central in XSLT.When you also find typos, such as not well-formed XML in the examples, you waste time to figure out if the XML itself is correct or not.In short, I didn't like this book."
4,i like it,i really like this book because of william shakespeare. it is a very interesting book and it shipped really fast
1,Poorly conceived.,"I downloaded the KIndle app on my I-pad. Mistake. Some of the text is so small, I can't read it. I can't ""zoom"" nor do I know what page or line I'm reading. This is a complete waste."
2,No active footnotes for Kindle,"Penguin needs to take more care before putting out the Kindle editions of their Pelican Shakespeare plays to make sure they're all properly formatted. This Pelican Kindle edition of The Tempest doesn't have active footnotes for the Kindle, unlike their edition of The Merchant of Venice which I downloaded at the same time. Without active footnotes, you have to click through several pages to get to the information referred to and then click several pages back to where you left off reading. Not a fun way to read Shakespeare."
2,"The Tempest,a confusingly great story by William Shakespeare","The Tempest is the best play and also the worst one I have ever read.Actually I think it's just a tale for kids.No one would believe in that kind of magic in the world today(in my opinion).Prospero wanted to sink King Alonso's ship just because he wanted to revenge that he expeled him from his island!On the other hand,I am so impressed in Shakespeare's imagination,the way he created the characters.It's so great.The words he used are like a poem instead of just ordinary conversations.The play itself is kind of dull,but because he added lots of feeling,revenge,and humorous,in it that's make the play a lot better."
1,I totally didn't understand this book,I hated it because I didn't understand it. It was those old kinds of English that people used to talk a way long time ago.
2,Not Easy to Figure out,"Shakespeare's play, The Tempest, is thought to be the most complex of his plays. The Island can be seen as a microcosm of life, and how Miranda comes alive after being captive to her father's tormented imprisonment of his own making."
3,"It would be five stars, if not written by Shakespeare","The Tempest was an interesting tale, that kept jumping from scene to scene, not wanting you to put it down. The magical, illusional, and assymetrical events somehow have a more modern twist to them than other plays. When I was finished I felt like Shakespeare didn't complete this play or was rushed. Compared to his other works, it wasn't as fulfilling."
4,Excellent Commentary on an unusual play,"Shakespeare is not my favorite author, although I do understand the concept of his Iambic Pentameter and its style and flourishes are highly regarded. While I can appreciate the labor it must take to put a story in such format, I frankly find the poetics of it hard to read. That makes the commentary (which is about half of this version) very helpful to people such as myself. By reading the corresponding notes, I was better able to put the story together with the style, making for an exciting tale. I would highly recommend this version to people who have difficulty deciphering Shakespeare's style."
3,"Wonderful play, but no line numbers in Dover Thrift Edition.","Of course Shakespeare's TEMPEST is an enchanting--and enchanted--play, but my comments here concern the DOVER THRIFT EDITION of the play. Dover is to be commended for making texts such as these affordable for readers on a budget. However, students and teachers alike should note that the Dover edition does not supply line numbers. Students who are considering this text for a class and may have to write about it will not be able to cite specific line numbers as is convention (Act.scene.lines; e.g., 3.1.34-47). Professors and teachers should also be aware of this limitation and weigh it against the affordability of this text."
3,The Tempest Review,"I found the Tempest to be very difficult to read. Even the introduction, which was not written by Shakespeare, was a hard read. It took me hours to get through those 100 or so pages, though I am a fast reader. The actual play was difficult because of the language and the complex line structure. The plot was interesting, but it was hard to follow as I read. I was forced to read a bit, then sit back and translate it. The main theme of the novel was re-evaluation of the soul and reconciliation."
1,Natural Food Recipes for Healthy Dogs,"Author Carol Boyle has very little to offer anyone who is seeking a well-balanced nutrional diet for dogs. Her knowledge of dog nutrition is very close to zero with offerings such as ""Hummus with Red Peppers"" and ""Eggplant Parmesan"". Basically, this is a recipe book comprised entirely of the stuff that Carol Boyle and her husband eat: mashed potatoes, braised cabbage, and cheesecake. No kidding! And, that's the ""dog diet"" you're going to get if you waste any money on this silly book."
1,The recipes in this book contain foods deemed harmful by the ASPCA,"Raisins, onion and garlic are harmful to dogs. This book references raisins on one page; onions on 41 pages; and garlic on 49 pages.According to the ASPCA:"" . . .Garlic does have toxic potential to pets, and is generally more potent than onion, . . .""""grapes and raisins appear to cause renal failure in dogs who've ingested large amounts."" ""it is advisable not to give grapes or raisins to dogs in any amount."""
1,The title misrepresents the content,"The recipes in the book are not what my vet. would recommend as healthy at all. For instance, who would feed their dog spaghetti and meatballs,cheesecake,salsa and cole slaw? The book was not worth the postage it took to receive it, much less the cost of the book itself."
2,Use as a guide to supplement your dog's regular food.,"This book is good if you want to add variety to your dog's diet-which I do, that is why I purchased the book. But be careful, the recipes call for onions which my vet said are toxic to dogs."
1,ONIONS ARE TOXIC,"I understand that this book suggests onions. This is outrageousas onions are TOXIC to dogs. There should be some kind of boardthat reviews books that recommend toxic substances to dogs, before they are published."
1,Natural Food Recipes for Healthy Dogs,This book is nothing more than a cook book for people with the implication it is for dogs! I was hoping for something more scientifically sound with REAL supplements aimed at growing a healthier dog. Instead I got a cook book for people. I will most likely cook some of the dishes but I will not be sharing them with my prize pooch.
4,A Celebration of Tulips but no planting advice......,"While I purchased this book thinking it would help me learn about planting tulip bulbs, I didn't find any planting information. What I did find was still equally enjoyable. I learned that my favorite flower once grew wild in central Asia. I also found a creative idea for a ""Tulip Ice Bowl."" There is a short history of tulips and Chris Mead's photography captures the free, optomistic and swaying in the breeze life of the tulip.If you are looking for a house warming gift, this would be so well received with a bunch of fresh tulips. When I look at this book, it reminds me of visiting LaConner, Washington for the Tulip Festival.~The Rebecca Review"
2,NOT REALLY FOR NORMAL MIDDLE CLASS HOMES !,Leave much to be desired in todays world in mid suburban home yards geared more for big homes and businesses in my opinion as I did not see any houses like middle class would have.
3,Very outdated,This book gives some decent design information but is otherwise quite outdated. It was published well before LED low-voltage lights were widely available.
2,There are better vids out there,Got this video to supplement of safety training program for college students. The material presented is a bit on the juvenile side. Also the presentation was not really professional. (More like a C grade movie production.) This safety video is inexpensive but did not impress. :{
5,"It's oil, what's not to like?","I love natural oils. You can put it on your skin, you can out it in your hair, you can add it to lotions. What is not to like? It softens my otherwise very dry skin and hair."
3,Makes for a good sugar scrub,Its a nice product and you get a lot of it in the bottle (goes a long way).I mix it with sugar for an exfoliating scrub.I give it 3 stars since I wanted to use it to help with my KP on my arms and lower back and part of my butt and while the exfoliation helps with smoothness it doesnt really help with the appearance of red dots. It's weird since in a shower they will be less noticeable and you think you found something that works but right when you dry off your skin goes back (this is even after months of continuos use so its not for me not using it for awhile as some might try to argue)
1,Gunky build-up :-(,"I am a regular user of Aura Cacia products, and have never been disappointed -- until using this. I typically use Aura Cacia Almond Oil after shower to keep my skin moisturized. I tried the Grapeseed Oil on a whim, and ended up throwing away the bottle before it was gone. This product left a horrible gunky buildup on both my skin and the tub, and did not provide the moisturizing that the almond oil (or any other skin care product) provides. I am terribly disappointed, and still trying to figure out how to get the mess out of my tub and how to remove the discoloration from my skin. Go with the almond oil instead!"
4,Excellent!,"The product arrived as advertized, on time, and in tact. High quality and low price make this competitive offering of grapeseed oil my first choice for a carrier oil for simple blends of massage oils."
5,wicked good battery,"works well, came fast, was wicked cheap, what more do you want from a cell phone battery"
3,It takes a lot of muscle to make alittle espresso!,"We cannot get the filter holder into the locked position smoothly, especially when it has grounds in it. We did put a lot of muscle behind it-and were successful getting it into the locked position. It makes great creme, the frother works very well. Two things right off the bat that bothered us....1) the filter holder as explained above. 2) you must stop the flow of coffee when you think it is enough. This is somewhat interesting since the longer it pours out, the more diluted the espresso gets..."
4,Much better then 2 stars,"I was very surprised to see that this book only got 2 stars from the previous reviewer. While I agree, that this is not a spectacular Paranormal it was touching and warm. At moments, humorous and sad. I would like to recommend that you give the book a chance and draw your own conclusions."
2,"Same old, same old. Predictable.","I've always been a sucker for paranormal romances but this book is nothing special. It was just something I read to help pass the time. This is the second book I've read that's an ""Angel's Touch Romance"" and I'm beginning to think that all the books under ""Angel's Touch"" promise a lot more than they actually deliver!"
5,Every new mom should have one!,"""Goodnight Moon"" is a long-standing family tradition for us and while searching for a new copy for my soon-to-be-born grandchild, I stumbled upon this journal. What a fabulous companion to the book and also a wonderful diary for the new baby. My daughter was in tears when she got it and called me immediately to say how wonderful it was. She had been looking at a ""Goodnight Moon theme for the baby's room and had no idea this existed. She started filling things in immediately! I highly recommend this for all new mom's."
1,"Simple game, simple graphics, misnomer name.",This game has 1. nothing to do with the moon. 2. nothing to do with a base.You essentially play a 2 angle game. 1. decide what to build (some strategy involved) 2. GUESS at how to aim. That's it. It's not even as fun as the OLD freeware scorched earth. Get that instead.
5,"Simple, yet fun","I am a hardcore gamer. Warcraft 3, Neverwinter Nights, and Freedom force clutter up my desktop. I literaly need 2 mountain dews a day to survive. SO HOW COME A GAME FROM THE SAME PEOPLE WHO MAKE ""Backyard Sports"" and ""Freddie the fish"" IS TAKING UP SO MUCH OF MY TIME!?!?! Very simple, very easy, VERY fun."
4,"fun variant of the classic ""artillery""","This game adds many fun options to what used to be called ""artillery"" (or ""Gorillas"", for those who explored QBasic). You have to build to get closer to your enemies, and protect your constructions; you are given about 10 distinct options for weapons, and there is a little ""paper, rock, scissors"" for defeating defenses.Multi-player is very fun. Single-player can be adequate for some non-challenging fun, but the game's AI could use some work."
3,"It's like the ""Checkers"" of RTS games.","This game has a certain brilliance in it's simplicity that makes it stand out among all the RTS games I've played. It's kind of like the board game ""Checkers"". The rules are easy to learn, but you can really stretch your mind coming up with various strategies to defeat your opponent. I think of Moonbase Commander as a glorified electronic board game. It can be addictive, and it doesn't set you back a lot of money.I would have given this game a higher rating if I was able to save a game in progress. It baffles me why this functionality was left out. That's an unforgivable oversight in my book.However, if you're tired of all the expensive, realistic, intense, and resource-hungry games out there, and you want to try a game that's inexpensive, abstract, and relaxing, this might just be your ticket to gaming fun. Don't be surprised if you sit down for ""just one game"" some evening and look at the clock only to find that it's 2:00am and several hours have gone by."
4,Headboard clip on light,"This is a sturdily designed and built clip-on light. It's perfect for a wooden headboard that is slatted, but it won't work for a rounded metal (like a brass bed) frame. Plus, if you are on the top bunk in a dorm, the clip won't have anywhere to grab on to, so the neck of the light will be twisted in an awkward angle. As an alternative, the light can be clipped on to a lapdesk; it casts a lot of light, so working on a laptop is great in bed."
1,Cheap product,"The materials are really cheap and if that doesn't bother you, how about that you couldn't wear this necklace at all because it has a permanent knot. To wear it, you need to cut it in half, and if you do, you will be choking yourself, when trying to put it around your neck. Don't waste your money."
1,Absolutely awful,"I'm a sucker for those cheap multi-movie packs of rare/obscure films(in this case horror films) that are so readily available now. I always think there might be a hidden gem somewhere among the ones that deserve obscurity. Unfortunately, i was suckered by this one big-time. ALL 3 films are terrible. Audio problems occure on two of the films, the gore/nudity/scare/interest factor was low on all 3 films. The extras are barely worth accessing once. I would review these 3 films individually, but that would waste more time that i already spent watching them. Since there are so many multi-packs and obscure films to pick from, i can honestly recommend you cross this one off your list and pick from something else."
4,As good as it'll probably get,"It was shot 20 years ago on high-def video tape (analogue 1250 lines) so it will never look as good as if they'd used film; but it looks great for what it was. Most of the color/contrast issues can be attributed to the lighting used. I've got 5.1 audio, but I think this is better with the LPCM 2.0 stereo track instead as the DTS 5.1 doesn't sound quite right. I'm not sure what they did, but it sounds like someone messed up. It's probably a technical limitation they tried to get around to give people what they think they want. It really sounds great with a good set of headphones (then you can really hear every subtle note without waking everyone).I loved the whole thing, but am thoroughly confused by the final curtain. I won't describe it for those who haven't seen it, but if anyone has & understands what the symbolism meant, please tell me. Thanks in advance."
3,Not Bad,"So far I've only seen the Valencia (Sci-Fi) production of the Ring. I read the Barenboim/Kupfer version had some of the best musicianship and acting but the production was bland and I think the reviewer was right. I'm not an opera buff so I'm not a judge of singing unless there's a lot of vibrato. The staging was dark and not impressive but the opera's still interesting. Maybe it's good to see a version that doesn't dazzle with special effects so much but I like that stuff. This was recoeded in 1991 I think and the video resolution's not that great. I think my next copy will be the new Metropolitan Production (another ""showy"" one).Make it like Cats or Miss Saigon, the helicopter can crash into Vahalla at the end. Cool."
4,Great cast,The costume's and sets are a little disapointing at times but I think this Ring has one of the best cast's I have ever seen or heard.
4,"Five for the Orchestra, Two for the Staging ...","... an average of 3.5, so let's call it four stars. Wagnerites assured me that it was the best I could get, though not perfect, so I took the plunge. I watched the whole thing, 11 disks, 15.4 hours. I could have attended the ""American"" Ring Cycle recently staged by the San Francisco Opera, or I could have purchased the purportedly ""feminist"" Copenhagen Ring production. I have the impression that every devout Wagner fan has a ""Platonic form"" of the operas in mind, an ideal production in comparison to which any actual staging will be a delusion or a disappointment. This production from the Bayreuth Festspiele surely can't match anyone's ideal.I've reviewed each of the four operas of the Cycle separately, in more detail."
2,A little disheartening...,"After reading the first two chapters, I was inspired! Esquith's motto of ""We can do better"" resonated within me. Yes, I thought, we CAN do better.I bought this book hoping for inspiration that could help me reach my at-risk learners. However, most teachers will never be able to teach the way that the author does. There are many things about Esquith's practice that are unattainable for me and my colleagues. I cannot realistically ever expect to be able to purchase my own science kits, to pay for guitar lessons for my students, or to spend from 6:45 am to 7 pm at school every day (and go back on Saturdays!) and still be an enthusiastic, balanced, dedicated educator.Instead of inspired, I felt disheartened. I recommend purchasing an alternate book that focuses on modifying classroom practices, such as Igniting a Passion for Reading, instead of this book."
3,Inspirational; not realistic for most of us,"This is a great read about teaching; unfortunately it is what only a few special teachers will ever achieve. For the rest of us, it's inspirational till the reality sets in that most teachers do not have the time or the money to get sponsors, make their classroom a non-profit organization, buy or get donors for equipment, and many other extras. And somehow all this is done while still doing what is expected of you by the school, the district, the testing, and the parents. I do admire his accomplishments, but would love to see someone write a book about how the ""ordinary"" teacher can inspire kids without sinking so much money and all their spare time and energy into their classroom."
3,Don't expect this in your classroom,"This book is well-written and inspirational. If you are a teacher reading this book, there are a lot of elements to strive for in your own classroom. Make no mistake, however, this is not what the majority of us can achieve. Mr. Esquith has a LOTTERY system to get into his class. A waiting list. This means that he has his pick of the students he will and, more importantly, will not take. I would love to be able to do all of the same things he does in his classroom, but the reality for most of us is that we have to do our best with the students we have.All students deserve the best education possible and we as teachers owe them that. If you want to try some of his techniques in your own classroom, definately grab this book. This book should be used for inspiration, not as a reality that we can attain at most of our schools. I HAVE to teach the students I get, problems and English proficiency and all. Mr. Esquith does not."
5,insightful,i really enjoyed the book. gave me lots of new ideas and reconsideration of some old ones
5,Teach like your hairs on fire,"Very satisfied with the condition of the book. I can't say enough about the content, it should be a must read for all teachers AND parents."
5,Inspirational and Intuitive!,"""Teach like your hair's on fire"" is a great book that will inspire all those who are or want to become teachers. It gives good insight as to what it is like to be a teacher, including the challenges and struggles you could potentially face. This book shows the importance of gaining trust of the students, and truly being an example and encourager for them. I highly recommend this book to everyone because it is inspirational and easy to read."
4,A great read for anyone thinking of becoming a teacher,"Esquith's book ""Teach like your hair's on fire"" is an amazing piece to read for anyone who has children, works with children, or is thinking of becoming a teacher. Esquith practices great teaching methods, and has a way of making his students feel like they are a part of something larger that just a fifth grade class. The way that he conducts room 56 could make any other teacher jealous, and any future educator inspired. His way of connecting to the students in his classroom is absolutely amazing. This book is a great example of how teachers motivate their students to become great people and the effect that they have on them."
3,"ideas, ego",Mr. Rafe is at his best when he describes his teaching methods and ideas. The book would be immensely more enjoyable if he had not repeatedly shamed and put down colleagues. Teaching is difficult; to teach well is an art. There was no need to state his judgments of other teachers. His ideas and examples stand on their own as outstanding. The denigration of colleagues weakens his book.
3,A Teacher's Perspective,"As a first year 5th grade teacher this books was inspiring. There are definitely some great ideas that I will try. Yet, after reading the book and reading some of the negative reviews I couldn't help but agree that Esquith does tend to criticize his fellow administrators and peers which goes against the six levels of moral conduct he cites.What Esquith does seems almost superhuman and although his stories were quite endearing I really had a hard time connecting with him as a fellow teacher. It felt almost like he was gloating about his successes with his students but would downplay his own doing by adding a hint of modesty. The book is really more about his story which is great if that was his intended purpose. But for myself, I personally have enjoyed the books that speak for all teachers.[...]"
5,Cornucopeia,"TEACH LIKE YOUR HAIR'S ON FIRE was our book club's recent selection. Several members are retired teachers, and were stupified at the amount of time the author devotes to his class... and somewhat skeptical. Those of us who aren't teachers found literally dozens of fascinating, practical tips about interacting with children in a variety of situations... travel, reading, character development, dining, finances... This is a terrific book, not only because it paints a fantastic picture of possibilities and change, but also because it is infused with such enthusiasm."
3,A lack of balance...,"Anyone that teaches twelve hours a day, six days a week, has got to be missing a great deal of ""balance"" in their own life. Remember, every strength has a weakness. There are some good points that can be learned here by Mr. Esquith, but take all of this with a grain of salt, and know, that you can still be a great teacher without commiting seventy two hours a week to your craft. ""There is no free lunch"""
3,Teach like your hair is on fire,"Loved the free spirit of the teacher who wrote this and the ideas he shared. Particularly some of the art projects, and I plan on doing one of them with my third graders!"
4,Helpful,I liked the book it contained concrete ideas about how to enhance your teaching and it was good to read about someone who loves teaching. At times it sounded a bit self complacent but I guess it's natural when you have been very succesful at something that is so difficult. As a teacher I found it helpful.
4,Awesome book.,This book was very inspirational and informative. A new principal at our school requested we read this and while not sure at first it turned out to be a good choice. I still have my copy and refer to it often. Can't say enough.
5,Great Ideas !!,"Mr. Esquith's book is both inspiring and practical. He appears to be an extraordinary teacher at an ""ordinary"" elementary school in LA. He teaches a class in which most of the students speak english as a second language. He brings the same enthusiasm to his writing that he brings to his classroom. Mr. Esquith's approach is to challenge himself and his students to want more. As I read it I thought of all the great teachers I know that strive to reach students on another level and don't let the administrative nonsense destroy them. Mr. Esquith has created his own special world in Room 56, the challenge is not to ""steal"" his ideas but create your own Room 56. The book is broken into easily digestable and entertaiming sections. This book is for every parent, student, teacher, ADMINISTRATOR, or person that cares about EDUCATION. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK !!!"
4,Four stars,"In this book, the author describes the methodology of his teaching, which is based on trust and Kohlberg's theory of moral development. In addition to describing lessons, he details every minute of his day from 6:30 a.m. until 6 p.m. and how he spends his time with his students. This book is an easy read, but it's hard to believe most of what Rafe does with his students. I've never read about a teacher so dedicated and hardworking that he even spends his Saturdays with students. My favorite part of the book was where Rafe describes the money system he uses in class to teach kids about organization, planning and the value of ownership. The only thing I disliked about the book was Rafe's self-righteous tone throughout."
4,Book,Book is in great condition. If you want to be a teacher defiantly read this book. Has a lot of great tips!
4,Awesome and Inspriring!,"I am a newbie in the field of education. I am actually a career changer and I stumbled across this book by accident. I downloaded it and was pleasantly surprised. This educator breathes life into his classroom. The kids have a tremendous amount of respect and they mutually care deeply for each other. This is what I aspire for my classroom room. It is truly inspirational and a must read, not only for teachers and future teachers alike, but for anyone who is at all curious of what goes on in great classroom across our country each day. If 2/3 rds of our classrooms had this level of energy our educational system may look a little different."
4,Artograph 1520,"The booth appears to be well made as far as the filtering and the exhaust goes. I was a little disappointed to find that the booth itself is made of cardboard. It does appear to be of a high quality and I assume that it will be less expensive to replace when the time comes, but I did expect a metal booth for the price. Overall though I am pleased with the purchase. The free shipping helped a great deal."
4,An excellent beginner harmonica,"This was the first Hohner harmonica that I bought, and I still use it frequently. It provides fairly easy access to bending for all of the appropriate notes, and of course has a very appealing price tag. The case is a slight deviation from the Hohner norm - two plastic halves split down the vertical instead of the horizontal middle and opened by pulling the sides apart. The tone is quite normal - nothing special but nothing bad. The only problem I find is that overblowing seems to occur easier than with any of my other harmonicas, but that can be avoided. Overall a great beginner harp, and definitely recommended as a first or travel harmonica."
3,Eh. :/,"So I have been obsessed with the harmonica for quite some time, and I was like Heck, I'll just buy one and learn it! After waiting (extremely impatiently) for three days I finally got it and was super excited. I was so excited that I just jumped of board and starting teaching myself. I tried to be so careful not to overblow it and break it, but after only one day, the draw on holes two and three aren't working anymore. :( When it worked it was great. It was great to play and my two year old was having a blast listening, but I think I should have invested in something a little nicer. :/"
2,ummm :(,"This harp is not the best item for somone who realy want to play ,it`s realy better for spare harmonica. But if you do decide to buy this harp make sure you clean it because the first time it gets diry (very dirty) it`s no good. Also if you get the Aceyou may want to buy a nicer case. This case is not bad but it falls off easier and just itsn`t as nice as some other cases."
2,Not sure where 35 minutes comes from?,"I have been taking yoga classes for about 9 months and was looking for a video that I could do at home when pressed for time. The video starts with a too-long, unnecessary introduction and then goes into a series of Sun Salutations. The instructor moved quickly throught this series and failed to explain the transitions, so it was very difficult to follow. Her instructions did get better in the following sections. After sticking with this for at least 45 minutes, with no end in sight, I was bored and irritated that the 35-minute workout did NOT live up to its name. If you decide to use this video, make sure you have the following props handy: blanket, 2 blocks, strap."
2,Dissapointed,"My church decided to purchase these to make it more efficiant at the time of making the deposit to the bank, the deal seemed perfect only that when we received it and was ready to use we found out more than 50% of the straps where not stick as it should so we ended up placing scotch tape :("
2,Disappointed,"I have purchased Naturalizers for years for my narrow foot but these shoes, tho cute were too short and width was too wide. I love mules and was so looking forward to wearing these but ended up being very disappointed and sending them back."
4,pinnacle,"Pinnacle Studio Plus Version 11Have used version 9 & 10 previously, this is is the best so far."
3,"Easy to use, but frustrating","I've used Studio since version 1.0. Now that we're on version 11.1, I can report that Studio basically hasn't changed. It's easy and fairly intuitive to use, but somewhat unstable. The latest version is huge, and on anything but simple videos you can expect occasional hangs, crashes, and unexplained phenomena. Is it better to have a more professional package like Premier that you can't figure out how to use, or a simple interface like Studio that crashes once in a while? For me, Studio is doing the job for a reasonable price."
4,Excellent!,"I used to own studio 7, 8 and 9. Most of the time the studio used either hang or took huge amount of time to process the video. But with studio 11, I haven't faced any hanging issue so far and performance is amazing. I can create 2 1/2 hours DVD in 2.5 hours. I definately recommend this product. Also the installation time is quicker too."
2,"Nice features, but very buggy.","I've used this product on two different computers hoping that maybe the problems I had on the old one was becuase it had XP and was slower. Once on a newer and more powerful computer with Vista, it has had no crashes. However, successfully burning a DVD is another matter. Using the old computer I have destroyed many discs, RWs were the safe way to go. Even then it wouldn't write over a used RW. I've run into other frustrating bugs while using it. With the new computer, I have had trouble even getting it to the burning stage. Be sure to use safe mode when burning to avoid disc wasting.I did give it 2 stars because the features are nice and easy to use. Once, and if, you do get the disc burnt it's usually fine."
1,Pinnacle Studio is AWFUL,I am a Software Engineer. I know software. I know how it should work when it is well designed and I know when software is poorly designed.Pinnacle is the MOST disappointing software I've ever purchased. It is buggy. Its performance is erratic on multiple platforms. It does not install properly. It damages your system when it does install.And Pinnacle Help is horrific: they'll respond quickly but you'll be left with hours of useless tasks to perform exactly and without any real goal except to wear you out.AVOID THIS JUNK!
2,"Good editor, bad file conversion","This program has a good editor for HD video. However, the file managment of this software going cfrom the camera to the computer, and file conversion from DVI to Window Media Player video is terrible. A ten minute video may take 30 minutes to upload. A file conversion from DVI to Window Media Player video can take hours. Very difficlt to be prodcutive with this software with HD video."
1,Would not load on my computer,I am using Windows XP with SP3. This software would hang during install with no message. I went to Pinnacle's website and did all that they claim would fix installation with SP3 and still was not able to load the software. This included removing my old Studio 9 and doing recommended registry clean. I had studio 9 and 10 and terrible problems hanging during editing and rendering. I bought this because reviews said it was much more stable. Didn't even get out of the gate!
4,Pinnacle Studio Plus Version 11,I have used Pinnacle for digital video editing since Version 8 and I have found this version to be very acceptable for editing. Its greatest assest is ease of use.
3,Got what we expected,"I got this for my husband so he could spend more time editing his videos at home than the 3 hours a week at a studio. He's mostly happy with Pinnacle; this version is an upgrade from the one he uses at the studio. The only problem is that for a mid-range consumer program, it hogs a lot of resources. We have to kill all processes that don't involve running the operating system (antivirus, firewall, startup programs, Internet)- basically one step up from safe mode. If we don't the software locks everything up.It also took a little trial and error to get it actually get it installed. We updated the software immediately as others suggested. Otherwise, we got what we wanted, considering it was under $100."
1,Don't buy this software!!!!,"If I could give it a zero star rating, I would. It is a horrible program. It keeps freezing on me all the time, I could not finish editing one single movie since I owe it, I am returning this to Amazon. A huge waste of money and your time."
3,"Arcade style gameplay, decent graphics",This is better than the first title with pretty good graphics and scenery but very unrealistic flying qualities. It's not like a flight simulator at all. Aircraft instrumentation is primitive. It reminds me of the Star Wars vehicles more than an airplane. It works better for me with a joystick instead of the PS3 controller. Very poor documentation adds to the frustration.
3,Too linear,Must be played almost exactly in the sequence it was written for. Some levels make no sense but must be played inn the way written. Could not finish due to unknown path on level where girl is rescued in France by landing plane on street. No way to get past flak. All logical ways are not permitted as plane control is taken over by game. No thinking allowed. Must go through flak. Can not make it without full health but game will not save unless finish level. Can start over at checkpoint but health too low. Sometimes you can finish the level but can still die and game did not save. Game could have been fun but as usual it was written for to experts and no way to change difficulty.
4,Not a gamer,"Blazing Angels 2 is a fun game.It's one of the rare games that is fun and has a storyline. If you kill a character, it's for a good reason. I like that in a game."
2,Not so great,"Not a great game, and I like WWII games. Needs more freedom to fly on your own. Game ends if you don't stay on the mission. Borring!!"
2,Blazing Angels 2,This game is not the greatest. Have to many things to do and just difficult for an older adult to figure out.
4,Delivers a great Sixaxis controller experience,"I played the first Blazing Angels and really enjoyed. I saw this one and thought why not give it a shot. Offers more planes and new miswsions. If you are not running 1080P(Full HD) don't bother. I have found that when your at a high altitude, the targets and the game play is crappy. Besides, who isn't playing games/watching movies on 1080P. It's almost 2010!!!"
5,Blazing Angels is wonderful,I brought this for my 12 year old son he truly loves it. The graphics are good and the flying is more realistic then some of the other flying games he has had. He really enjoys this and its family friendly.
3,its just ok,i was expeciting not to easy to drive the airplane. the graphics are great but just like no surprises in the game
4,Challenging game,"Challenging is the epitome of the game, but that's not to take away from the gameplay it's a very interesting and exciting game. Once you get used to the controls and steering of the planes it's a fun game."
4,Does not come with a headband!,"The mask is great. Inexpensive and durable. One thing they don't tell you is that it does not come with a head band. Fortunately, I had an old hardhat that it fit. Byers be aware."
3,Photo falsehood.,"I should have known at this price, the shield came without the head gear. I have used a mesh screen before and prefer it for flying chips and rocks while weed whacking. If I could find the nice cradle shown in the picture, I would likely buy it. The photo is very misleading; and if the facts are in the text, pictures speak loud enough that the words get overlooked."
2,Oh god shoot me now,"Awful airy fairy prog with nothing progressive about it. Lame melodies, playing and some of the most stupid lyrics I've heard outside an Aryeon album. ""Perfume my vapor dream"", what the hell? I'll give it two stars as they can play their instuments and the sound quality is good throughout, but god is this thing shallow. Any band with a name taken from Lord of the Rings should immediately raise a red flag with potential customers. If its named after a place in Mordor its most likely gonna be a black metal band a la Gorgoroth, or Ephel Duath. If its named for an elf or good character etc. its most likely to be this kind of gauzy, ephemeral mush. Should go great with your unicorn and wizard figurine collection."
2,Use a USB port...,"This is slow to install, dificult to take anywhere, and slow to transfer info. Buy a USB connected ZIP or better yet, for this kind of money you should be able to get a CD-RW."
1,A great primer for commissioned sales people,"This book will teach both young and old people everything that high pressure commissioned insurance, real estate and other sales people are taught in sales school.Makes their jobs much easier.You can skip this one, unless you are a commissioned sales person with no soul."
1,Looking for some great financial advice?,"If so, then keep looking. I'de recocommend Talking Money or The Savage Truth on Money, both of which are more current and better than this tome.Quinn's book is huge, but still lacking in critical information. Most is just generic, common sense much, like how to buy a house is bad advice.You can skip this one."
1,"NOTHING FANTASTIC, THERE ARE BETTER ALTERNATIVES!","At well over a thousand pages, the first impression that you will get concerning this book is that its price is reasonable. But, the big BUT here is that the contents are on the contrary.I beg to disagree with some of the suggestions Mrs Quinn offered. They sound odd. Out-of-the-blues! Money seldom heeds the one-way traffic rule that you and I would like it to. Mrs Quinn seemed to have forgotten that. Well, I would not advice anyone to invest based on what he or she learnt from this book. Its contents are shallow! There are better alternatives: ""The Wall Street Journal Guide to Understanding Money & Investing"" is of greater value. You may start from Eric Tyson's ""Personal Finance for Dummies"", if you are a beginner."
2,Very comphrehensive book!,"Jane Bryant Quinn has updated her previous classic from 1991 with this 1996 classic. It covers everything! Quiin is funn and witty too! Everything is covered in detail. I could g on and on but you would think that I own stock or am a friend of the author or something. Can't recommend this high enough so yeah, go ahead and spend the ($$$) for a used copy. Well worth it!"
2,Mostly Fluff,"Instead of wasting your hard earned money on this, I recommend Eric Tyson's books; Investing for Dummies, Mortgages for Dummies and Personal Finance for Dummies.Ric Edlemen newest book is also a must read for solid financial advice.Tyson and Edelmen are both accomplished writers and genuine authorities in the financial field.Quinn is just a writer."
1,Interesting Opinion. Don't buy it!,"JBQ has to be the most opinionated writer of all time. Unfortunately, her opinions won't save or make you any money. If you are interested in this book, do what I did, read it at the library. Even though it is 1,000+ pages, most of that is fluff and you can get through it in a short time.Don't bother to take notes. Nothing in this book is worth writing down. It's that bad and I am being kind."
2,Pure nonsense!,"I tried Quinns advice on buying my first home. I bought a ""wreck"" as Quinn describes or a ""fixer upper"" as they are called in the industry.What a fiasco! I had to put over $... in new siding and that was after searching for a contractor that would do it because this house had aluminum siding and asbestos. The wiring was bad. And there were a ton of other problems wrong with this ""wrecker""After all was said and done I could have bought a brand new house for less than what I payed for this ""wrecker""I also tried the college saving advice in the book and hit a deadend again."
1,Mostly common sense - insurance advice is way off,"This book plays on common sense and makes it appear revolutionary!The credit card and reducing debt is basic is as basic goes.Most of the financial information you already know.The investment part is totally worthless. Just check the advice and go back three years and see how you would have done following this advice. If you followed Quinns advice, you already know what I mean.Insurance advice will have you way overinsured, you'll be insurance rich, but cash poor. Just what the insurance companies love.The only use that I get out of this book right now is as a overpriced door stop."
1,Skip this one - it's worse than bad,"It has been said that during the last bull market, a blindfolded monkey shooting darts at a dart board and making selections based on where the darts landed could have made a fortune.Conversely, I know people who lost a lot of money following Quinn's""safe"", ""expert"" advice.So if it comes down to choosing advice from Quinn or a blinfolded monek, go with the moneky. Your chances are better!"
2,"Condescending and repetitious, not practical or timely","First of all, I found the manner that Quinn discusses debt management pretty offensive and condescending. Also very repetitious. She spends pages discussing what should only take a paragraph or two.Also much of the information like a home is an asset and pay it off quickly is inaccurate. Notice she never discusses the expences tied in with that ""asset"" like mortgage life in addition to the regular maintenance of that ""asset"".Quinn mentions term life insurance but seems partial toward cash value insurance. In this regard, I definitely recommend Suze Orman who flat out states that cash value insurance is a ripoff and IF you need life insurance at all, term is the only practical choice...and I agree (I used to sell life insurance).Overall, I do not recommend this book. The best parts seem to be repeated over and over and much is outdated or inaccurate.Give this one a pass."
2,BORROW IT--DON'T BUY IT!,"I gave this book a 3 only for peoplewho don't know beans about personalfinance and like to read as a hobby.The information is way too basic andsome is misleading i.e. her commentson stock splits. Quinn makes itsound like when a stock splits say2 for 1, you now have two five's inplace of one ten. The truth is whena stock splits a tremendous amountof momentum and excitement iscreated --- it goes beyond a stocksplitting,it's the amount of moneythat can be made during all phasesof the split that makes investing instocks that are splitting exciting. I saw similiar errorswith insurance. home buying, mutualfunds, credit etc, etc.etc. If youare curous, like was, you may wantto read this. But don't take the in-formation too seriously and you'lldefinitely want to read some otherfinancial books to get some realmeaty financial techniques. My bestadvice---save your money and yourtime---READ SOMETHINGELSE."
1,What a crock!,"I have read quite a few books on personal finance and this one is the absolute worst. Quinn suggests that you have your insurance premiums raised and your deductibles lowered? This is exactly what your insurance agent wants and the exact opposite of what you need to do.Quinn may have meant well, but her advice falls far short of what consumers really need to succeed in the 21st century."
1,Outdated and misleading,I want to warn all readers about this book. I have read over a hundred books in the areas of personal finance and investing and am very successful. The information in this book is dated and the methodology not very useful.There are many other better books to read.
5,"Very complete, good advice","Talks not just about investing, but all aspects of financial planning, even ones that are often overlooked like life insurance and disability insurance. A great book to read instead of (or in addition to) seeing a financial planner. Well-written, although because it's so complete, it can be a slow read."
1,Try the Mutual Fund Wealth Buider instead,"No doubt, there are a lot of unethical activities beig committed in the securities industry. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of acrimony in thefinancial book selling business and for that reason I strongly suggest all readers to avoid this book by Quinn.If you want competent investing adviceabout mutual funds and invesing in print form, I highly recomend The Mutual Fund Wealth Builder by Dick Fabian. Fabian, unlike Quinn actually understands this industry, has made money investing and knows what he is talking about.Quinn doesn't have a clue."
4,Excellent First Start,"I studied this book--probably an earlier version--when I got out of college 12 years ago. This book was one of my first financial books and has helped me manage my money. What impressed me was the comprehensiveness of the book, which focused on money management from every possible life stage of a normal investor. The worksheets that the book has built into lend themselves into importing into Excel for your own personal use. At many stages of my life (i.e. Establishing a mortgaged, refinancing, purchasing life insurance) I have pulled this book off of the self to get a non-bias view of what I should do-and more importantly what traps I should avoid.I would recommend this book if you only purchase one financial book."
4,Excellent Reference Book,"I have read the previous version of this book cover-to-cover a number of times and found it to be an excellent reference/overview book. However, I find much of her advice to be very vanilla and too simplistic. For a topic as complex and important as personal finance, one should have a variety of resources available and should continue to educate oneself. I believe that this book can be a valuable part of that library, but should not be the only item. I have loaned this book to numerous people for education purposes, but only with a list of the applicable sections to read."
5,Very good,"Jane Bryant Quinn updated her previous classic; everything you could possibly need is in here, and it's witty, too. It is just fantastic: it covers every single area of personal finance. I read the previous one cover to cover, and this is different."
1,Terrible Investment advice,"I can understand all of the one star reviews, but I don't understand why nobody has mentioned the ridiculous investment advice by Quinn. Her investment advice is way off.And I love her credit management advice: ""Don't use plastic and don't get over your head in debt.""WELL DUH!!! Thanks a lot Quinn. My parents told me that when I was 12 years old.This book stinks. Avoid it like the plaque."
2,Highly over-rated book,"The few 4* and 5* reviews are from people who basically relate to Quinn because of her association with Newsweek. Keep in mind that there is no correlation between a writer who only writes about money and her knowledge of accurate, comphrehensive and effective money techniques. If Quinn is so great, where are all of the success stories?? Hmmm????"
1,Retitled book - You can skip this one,This is just another version of Everyone's Money Book released by Quinn back in 1991. Same book - more fluff.Do not confuse this title with an ecxellent book written by Goodman with the same title.
1,Pure GARBAGE!,"Where does Quinn get off suggesting that we should ask our insurance agents to raise our premiums? That is akin to asking a car salesman to tell us how much we should pay for a car and raise the price if necessary.As Suze Orman says, ""The best financial advisor we will ever meet is the one that we see in the mirror."" This is especially true when it comes to insurance products.And let's put to rest the misconception that Quinn is tryig to put insurance people and other financial professionals out of business---she is supporting them, not attacking them!This boo is pure garbage. Avoidd it like the plague."
1,Lot's of words--No Content..,"Although this book is over 1,000 pages long, the oly meat could have been summed up in 10-12 pages.Suggest Suze Ormans 'The Road to Wealth' or Eric Tysons 'Personal Finance for Dummies' for some real advice o what it takes to be financially succesful.Quinn is a good writer but is clueless on personal finance."
1,Another potboiler written by a publicity hound,"P>There are many good books out there. Some folks think that any book written about personal finance is a worthwhile read. Take my word for it, you can skip this one.Quinn tried to catch the coat tails of Venita Van Caspel when she [Quinn] wrote her first back back in the early 80's (It bombed) and we thought we were only forced to read her rhetoric in Newsweek and that would be it.In the late 80's, personal finance books again became popular and you guessed it, Quinn made a comeback with two lame efforts; 1991 and this worthless tome that came out in 1997.Quinn is a talented writer, but IS NOT a financial expert. She needs to stick to journalism and forget trying to compete with legitimate female financial experts like Suze Orman or Terri Savage (Re: The Savage Truth about Money)You can skip this book and never miss a beat."
1,Didn't do anything for me,I am new to personal finance but found this book pretty much a study of the obvious. More or less common sense. I am very dissapointed with this book.
1,College Student not happy with Quinn's advice....,"Advice for college students as espoused by Jane Bryant Quinn couldn't be worse. How can Quinn say that CD's, Money Market Accounts and T-Bills are safe investments. With these ""investments"" you are guaranteed to lose money.I'm working two jobs to cover the mistakes (advice) offered by Quinn.And check out who places ad's in newsweek. Do I see a conflict of interest? Hmmmmmmm."
2,This book isn't that bad!,"No doubt, Making the Most of Your Money is now nearly 7 years old and a lot of the material is outdated. But at least Quinn does a good job on showing you how to reduce debt---so did my mother.While this book isn't ""that bad"", I would give it a pass. Suggest The 10 Day Financial Breakthrough by James L. Paris or 9 Steps to Financial Freedom by Suze Orman for some good financial advice and both of those books will still cost you less than Quinn's.There. I've saved you some money while showing you a way to get better advice. (MUCH BETTER ADVICE)"
1,Not recommended - Outdated advice,"I bought this book along with Suze Ormans book; The Courage to be Rich and a few other books by Ric Edelman and Charles Givens.Of the books mentioned, Quinn's book was dead last. This information is six years old. Edelman was the best followed by Orman and Givens.Quinn has a nice writing style, but the content is horrific. Not a good financial book.You can definitely skip this one."
2,Why pay when you can get the information FREE????,"First of all, this book is really only about 150 pages of information expanded into 1,000 pages of fluff. The best of what is in here, can be found on the internet....FREE. Why pay Quinn???However, if you really insist on reading this book, check it out at the library for FREE. Or buy it at a used book store for a buck or two. Just remember to take the jacket off when you are out in public so you don't embarass yourelf.For some real real meat, I recommend Invest 101 or Talking Money.Another important point, Making the Most of Your Money is now over 6 years old and outdated, BUT judging by Quinn's recent articles, her philosophy has not kept up with the times. So don't get too excited if a newer version of Making the Most of Your Money comes out. It will just be""same ole, same ole.""Save your money. Only one who makes the most of their money with this overhyped tome is Quinn."
2,Not that good. I was dissappointed,"Unquestionably, this is one of the worst financial books I have ever read. Easy to see why all of the 1 star reviewers are not too happy. I gave the book 2 stars for Quinn's writing abilty. -3 stars for financial information."
1,SHOULD BE SOLD IN PAIRS-GREAT BOOKENDS,"Yes, they should sell this as a 2-1deal. The books would make greatbookends---that would be the bestuse of MsQuinns material! Most of what Quinn offers is basic and general, much is outdated for thetimes and in many places, Quinn shows that she is a journalistic paper financial authority only. There is better information out there by authors who are more up on the times and have researched morecarefully their material. ."
1,Easy to see why Americans are doing so poorly with money,"If this book represents the best advice available to Americans (according to consumers report), no wonder Americans are doing so poorly with their finances.In Japan, we save on average 30% of our income and are debt free. In America, you try to live on 125% of your income and are deep in debt. Unfortunately, books like this one by Quinn will only make things worse not better.Only in America can a mediocre book like this one be touted as the best information available.Unbelievable!"
1,Archaic and boring,"This book may have been written 8 years ago but it is at least 12 years behind the times. Making the Most of Your Money gives whole new meaning to the word--archiac.And even though I love reading books on personal finance (Goodmans Everyone's Money Money is huge but a joy to read as well as up-to-date), this book was a hard slog probably because I am so articulate about personal finance and had to stop so often to circle all of the mistake int his book.I usually am perceptive enough to see a scam and hate to admit that I got taken, but I got sucked in by all of the hype about this archaic and very boring book. You got me this time, but never again!"
2,Outdated book!,"One hundred fifty six reviews, 1072 pages and #81 best sellers at Amazon.com, truly amazing! On close inspection, the book was pulished in November 1997, and very much outdated. Yet to her credit, Jane is an excellent writer and does get the point across. Unfortunately, the info in this book is common sense that you would learn in any business school, newspapers, or magazine. Consumer Report September 2003 issue rated this book #1 and Suze Orman's ""The Road to Wealth"" #2. What sells may not be what is useful in real life....."
3,Good as a starter financial book,"This large book encapsulates so many areas of personal finance and should be a part of everyone's personal library.Makes a lot more sense than trusting commission earning financial people.If you like this book, then you also must read ""More Wealth without Risk"" and ""Financial Self Defense"" by Charles Givens. These books fills in the holes that Quinn misses.All three are great books."
1,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad is better","...this bookis out of date and contains potentially dangerous information, such as the insurance advice. In other areas, it is way too conservative. The investment advice offers limited upside but deep downside...I saw this book for sale for $1.75 at a used bookstore and nobody would buy it. Does that tell you something?"
1,This is a very poor book.,"Without a doubt, this is the worst financial book that I have ever read. No wonder Ms. Quinn's newspaper column was cancelled!"
1,Ever hear Quinn on tape?? Yuck!!!!,"I guess by the number of 1 star reviews that reders are pretty unhappy with the printed version of Making the Most of Your Money. BUT...No matter how bad that book really is, nothing is as bad as listening to Quinn on tape---YUCK!By the way, Quinn does recommend cash value life insurance, credit life and her mutual fund advice is at least 12 years out of date."
1,Not what it appears to be - I returned it.,"Don't waste your money on this. Instead read Millionaire next Door or The Only Money Book you will ever need by Tobias.Following Quinn's advice will cost you, not save you money. Very dissappointed with this.I also recomend Robert G. Allens Multiple Streams of Income for strategies that work (unlike Quinn's)"
1,Not so sound advice!,"Unless you consider giving misleading pension advice, suggesting mutual funds that vastly underperform the market, recommending insurance advice that only makes your agent richer and home buying advice that includes buying into a toxic enviroment.Only the most naive to personal finance bought into Quinn's b.s. in the past and only a caveman would buy into it now.Terrible, terrible, terrible advice Quinn."
1,"I disagree with the ""reviewer"" from ""Silicon Valley""","After carefully reading that review, I can't help but wonder if that person has a reading problem or comprehending what she reads.The fact is, that as anyone who has read this book knows, Quinn does recommend Cash Value Life Insurance. She also recommends converting from Term to Cash Value and she also suggests Credit Life Insurance as well.So I have to agree with the other reviewers that Quinn is attempting to push cash value life insurance and other expensive unnecessary insurance products either deliberately or becuae she doesn't know any better.In any event, bad advice."
1,Rate it T for Terrible,"Quinn's insurance advice will make you insurance poor.Quinn's investment advice will make you cash poor.Quinn's personal finance advice will make you a financial victim,instead of a financial victor.You only learn about money from those who have it, not from those who write about it.This is a nice book filled with lousy advice."
4,Clearly a smear campaign is afoot against this author,"Anyone with sense can see that some kind of focused attack against the author is afoot here. I have read Ms. Quinn's book and find it to be excellent in most financial matters. I have purchased it for several members of my family and recommend it to my friends as well. As for her ""lack of expertise"" in financial matters, give me a break. Ditto her advice on insurance matters. The book does not offer advice. It offers information. You, as the reader, take this information -- as well as information from other sources -- and make reasonable and informed decisions about your financial life. I don't know Ms. Quinn from Adam, but it's clear there's some kind of smear campaign afoot here, and that is highly unfair, as she is a distinguished journalist."
1,Not that good - I was dissappointed,"Despite the high flying five start reviews and obviously paid for article in Consumers Report a few months back, I found this book boring and totally lacking in real information. Much is outdated such as the college information, investing and the ""new Roth IRA"" (Quinn tells the age of this book with that one)and other information such as insurance and pension advice is harmful to your wealth.I'm taking my copy back for a fullrefund after only three days."
3,Must have reference material,A comprehensive overview of virtually every personal financial topic. Clear and consise information presented in a easy to readand understand format.
1,"Old, outmoded thinking is showcased here","I think I've finally figured out why this 7 year old book appeals to a few readers. Despite the fact that this is the information age, some folks prefer to cling to old, outmoded idealogy despite the fact that it really doesn't work. Information and education is doubling every two to three years. This book is now nearly 7 years old! No thanks, I'll pass!"
2,FOR BEGINNERS ONLY,"If you ahve no real money ""SMARTS"" this book may be for you. The best of what this book offers is available elsewhere. Do yourself afavor, borrow it from a library and save yourmoney for a good meal or a BETTER BOOK"
1,Why pay for outdated advice? What a waste of paper!,This is now nearly 7 years old and it wasn't all that great when it was released.Most of the information is outdated and useless. The pension information is very misleading. Insurance information will leave you insurance rich but cash poor due to too much insurance.Quinn's advice doesn't work. Why do you suppose her newspaper column was cancelled?
1,Perplexed indeed!,"I am perplexed too at the fanfare for this very old and outdated book.It's funny too how Quinn refers to the recent (ha, ha) Roth IRA!I picked up a copy Making the Most of Your Money at a used books store for under a buck and felt cheated.It's your money"
2,My two cents worth....,"Quinn does offer some good nuggets of advice in her program.The problem is that the good stuff is so interspersed with b.s. and is confusing.Quinn does recommend cash value insuranceOn page 296-""Premiums normally stay the same"", Comparinh to term, ""Policy preiums are level:, ""tax protect [cash value]"",""for those who want certaintly""On page 326 Cash value vs term and a mutual fund. ""You will be better served to keep cash value insurance""On replacing policies, term for cash value, Quinn states on page 328;""You'll be raiding your cash values which may be earning a attractive yield""On discussing Insurance Fee Advisors, Quinn states;""Typical fee of $100-$250 per hr may be a bargain""Quinn also recommends Single premium insurance which is whole life with a tax deffered option. Even annuities are a better choice (although not my choice!)For most people term or lpt (level premium term) are far better choices than whole life.5 star reviewer, try reading the whole book!"
2,Poor quality - outdated material,"For someone who is supposed to be as big as Quinn is, I wld have expected more in terms of quality of the reproduction of the tapes, overall financial content and information.The only thing worst than the tapes I suppose is the book.SUGGESTION: Buy Suze Orman's products instead. She is the best."
2,Revised???,"I bought this book on the basis that it was a revised edition only to find that it is only revised from the edition that came out in 1991.So instead of having 12 year old advice, I only have 6 year old advice? No thank you.I also think that Quinn overdoes the debt thing. But if you really want a good book to get out of debt, try ""The Everything Book to Get Out of Debt""And I don't trust Quinns advice (or is that opinions) on trusts and estate planning either. There are better, more current books out there.When Making the Most of Your Money was written back in 1996, there were a lot of trust seminars going on so I assume that this is Quinns way of jumping on the bandwagon of a popular topic. Unfortunately, her advice is outdated and incorrect.Not a good book for the times."
1,Behind the Times,"Do yourself a favor, skip this book and read Ric Eddlemens books instead. Ms Quinn may have good intentions, but her information is very, very misleading and can be hazardous to you wealth!"
2,Not to be used without parental supervision,"Although there are a few pieces of worthwhile information in this book, I would not recommend this text to any inexperienced or neophyte money fool. A lot of the information is obsolete for the times so if you do shell out the bucks for this, make sure you consult with an experienced financial pro who can point out the pot holes and trap doors and other loopholes that are left wide open.The title How to Make The Most of Your Money is misleading and a misnomer. At best, this is just a basic overview and as already mentioned, much is outdated."
1,Not the best use of your money - Yuck!,The only one who makes the most out of their money if you foolishly buy this over-rated book is Quinn!Quinn's weekly newspaper column was cancelled last JANUARY due to a lack of reader interest. No one reads Quinn's material anymore. There are too many other good books out there to waste your time and money with this one.
5,I love this game!,"In computer class at school, I always play this game. It is like your are playing a real game at Turner Field or something like that . My team is pretty good, but I can't just watch the game. Be careful when you are picking teams because, you might get a person that is not very good. I get Nomar G. as my shortstop, I like the Boston Red Sox. Get Randy J. or Carlos D. as your pitcher. This is a fun game to play if it is raining and you just want to ""PLAY BALL"""
4,This game is awesome...,"I really thought when I downloaded a demo of this game that it would be good and I wasn't disappointed. The only things I don't like about this game is winning 45-0, 50-0, etc. and also having to wait for the two idiot announcers to shut up before the pitcher will pitch the ball. Sometimes the announcers can talk for a long period of time and you are forced to press the ESCAPE button to make them shut up and get on with the game. I game the game 4 stars for these reasons, but the game is one cute game and you will never get over some of the kids voices and antics. They are just too cute. :)"
4,Backyard Baseball 2003,"I bought this for my 9-year old grandson three or four months ago, and he just loves it. The game permits him to make many choices, so that he feels he can play the way he wants. He is a super baseball player and fan, so he needs to be kept challenged. This games does this for him.He constantly reminds me that althought this is a good game, it's not the greatest because it doesn't have Mark McGwire in the lineup. However, it doesn't keep him from playing and enjoying the game."
2,Backyard Basketball,"One of my favorite Games from the Backyard series would have to be Backyard Baseball 2003, because it has all of my favorite players such as Chipper Jones, it also has all of my favorite teams (Atlanta Braves).I think that Backyard Basketball was a really big dissapointment. With terrible graphics and only two Pro Players. Thre was also no pro teams. I think that Humongous Entertainment should make a Backyard Basketball 2004. They should also have more than 2 pro players. They should have at least ten NBA players and at least five or ten WNBA players"
4,forced to do setups,"From the makers of putt-putt,freddi fish,spy fox and pajama sam comes backyard sports.It's fun but you buy it on software,that's where it gets **** instead of *****.Humongous FORCES you to do their setups BEFORe you can play your game."
1,The Complete And Total Destruction Of A Perfect Game,"It is truly remarkable that one of the greatest games ever made for PC was so easily and utterly destroyed in the 2003 version by a completely unbearable voice track. The voices are so mechanical, repetitive, and grating that it is impossible to play the game for more than ten minutes without turning off your speakers or tearing out your hair. The upgrades and updates to the game certainly don't outweigh this horrific failure; it is hard to believe that anyone at Humongous tested this game because no sensible person would have released it to market...."
5,WONDERFUL!,"THIS GAME LET'S YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES! YOU PICK YOUR OWN MAJOR LEAGUE TEAM, ONE OF THE FIELDS, AND THE MEMBERS ON THE TEAM AND TRY TO WIN THE WORLD SERIES TITLE! I HIGHLY RECOMMAND THIS GAME OR ANY OTHER OF THESE PRODUCTS FOR A HOLIDAY PRESENT!"
5,great game,this game is a great game for kids. My son spends half of his day playing it. this game is for children of all ages.
4,Midnigh Love,"I recommend this CD. Fellas, you can put this on when that special lady comes over and it will set the mood."
1,I agree...what a mess!,"I was so happy to find a coffee grinder that grinds the beans into a bottom container for so cheap. But the grounds fly everywhere! The plastic container is so full of static that the fine grounds stick to it like glue. This product does not come with a very good instruction book either. You have to experiment with times, settings, etc. until you can kind of get the consistency you want. I think I'll go back to my blade grinder."
1,Complete garbage!,"This thing produces a very coarse and completely inconsistent grind even at the 'finest' setting. Way too coarse for espresso - not even close. Much too inconsistent for French press. Maybe it's useable for drip coffee, maybe. But then why not just use a blade grinder for that? It would be less expensive, take up less space, and much easier to clean."
1,Not satisfied at all,I use a fine grind to make coffee with. The fine setting of this grinder wasn't close to the fine grind that I get from the grinders at my local supermarket. I have a Krups 203B which does a much better job even if I have to guestimate when it is done. I am not satisfied at all with this product and consider it a waste of money.
1,Terrible! Don't buy!,"This coffee grinder essentially stopped working after a couple grinds. Even the finest ground was totally coarse to begin with, then it quit entirely. I sent for a free replacement of the grinder gear (what supposedly was the initial problem), and with the replacement it limped along for a couple more months, still with very coarse grounds, then quit again. And, the countertop somehow always ended up a mess. I feel that you are better either getting a more expensive burr grinder, or go with a higher quality blade grinder for about the same price."
1,konked out,my Melitta has been humming along for over a year and just stopped working...it got used a few times a week nad it would often get stopped up and now just won't due anything anymore. very dissappointed
1,not a bargain,"I heard that burr grinders offer a better, uniform grind when compared to blade grinders. I do not have experience with professional grade burr grinders, but this one simply is not very good. It does grind coffee, so for the price it serves its purpose. But it is very difficult to clean the grinding mechanism and I had to fashion a seal out of duct tape to prevent it from spewing coffee dust everywhere (and yes, the container was locked into place). If you're looking for a cheap grinder, go for a blade. They're easy to clean and don't make a mess."
1,Melitta MEBG8B Burr Grinder by Salton,"This grinder is the poorest one I have used. It would not grind fine enough even for drip coffee, much less for expresso. After I took it apart and reset the adjustment wheel to the point of the burrs actually contacting, the grinder was adequate for drip. I expected better results since the design is essentially the same as a previous Salton grinder, the Maxim GC-30. The burrs, on the melita appear dull, as if they are cast instead of machined."
1,And it SEEMED like such a great deal....,"There is only one problem with this low-cost Melitta coffee grinder with all of these great features, but unfortunately it is a REAL deal breaker: Even at the finest grind setting, this grinder produces VERY large grounds. While at first this may not seem like a big problem, you soon notice that you need to grind about three times the coffee beans for your morning cup of coffee than with any other grinder model. So, within a few weeks you have just eaten-up any savings you kept by buying this low-cost coffee burr-type grinder -- and within a month you are just throwing money down the drain day-in and day-out. In other words, buy a more expensive burr-type grinder -- or simply a cheap blade-type grinder."
3,Bad show,"I purchased the little bugger , an it works .So what do u vant for 20 bucks ?Alright , next time yous get the Mercedes one !Fer me , its wickedly good grinder , hope its fer u ?"
2,Trying to Wash It Killed It,"The grinder worked fine and would have gotten a good review from me, but my wife tried to clean it and got some water into it and it ceased working after about 2 months.I'm looking for a different one to replace it. Maybe it would be OK if you don't get it wet."
2,My first grinder,"I've had this burr grinder for over two years now. I was very happy with it for a while, but it soon didn't grind evenly no matter what setting you used. And I soon found out I had to use twice as much coffee bean to make the perfect pot. I had difficulty removing the burr so my husband took the thing apart for me, and we found about a pound of coarsley unevenly ground coffee stuck in the back of the machine! What a waste! We have had unscrew and empty that wasted coffee twice so far. I am looking for a new grinder."
1,It's all true,"everyhting they say about this POS is true. I have two here, if anyone wants one. They don't even make a good paperweight."
1,"Worked okay, then broke","Out of the box, I was excited to have a burr grinder at such an attractive price. I make coffee in a drip machine as well as in a french press, so I enjoyed the flexibility. While it worked, it certainly was satisfying for the price. The difference in coarse and fine wasn't as good as my current unit, but it worked. Well, for a while - the plastic wheel which held the element snapped in fairly short order. No goodsie! So, works okay for the casual, non-discriminating consumer; but it's a Bic... disposable."
1,Horrible Grinder,This isn't worthy of being listed on Amazon!! It's cheap and only held up for about 25 grindings before it was ready for the junk bin. The cheap plastic internals don't last and the motor gave out. Total piece of junk.
1,NO STARS!,I see they're selling for half price. I hope that means the end of them. Mine died after 9 months. Phooey!
1,NICE LOOKING BEAN KILLER,"BEWARE. The grinder is compact and nice looking but that's it's only virtue. It has a top hopper that is supposed to hold 1/2 pound of beans. Storing beans in the hopper will GUARANTEE STALE BEANS AND BAD COFFEE. THE HOPPER AND LID ARE SO FLIMSY THAT THE LID DOES NOT LOCK IN PLACE. ANY VIBRATION AT ALL CAUSES IT TO POP UP AND COME LOOSE. I could not get the lid to stay in place just trying to but it on out of the box. You have to hold the lid down manually when grinding or it rotates itself and pops loose. The ONLY way to use this grinder is to measure out the amount of beans you need and then put them in the hopper and grind them all. But don't do it if there is anyone asleep in the household. This thing makes enough noise to wake the dead. And, at the middle setting in the grind adjustment, IT PRODUCES GRAVEL."
2,Melitta MEBG8B Coffee Mill,"This coffee grinder did not meet our expectations. It states that it grinds ""from very coarse to very fine for espresso"", but we could not get it to grind to this level. It appears that it would be OK for a regular coffee grinder, but not if you want a nice fine grind for a good cup of espresso. So we returned it and are in search of a better grinder."
2,OK if you don't like find grind,I read the reviews that said this was an OK burr grinder for the money so long as you don't want the really fine espresso grind which I don't. What they failed to say is that it barely grinds it fine enough for my coffee machine. If I use the French Press it seems to grind about right. I like the size of the machine and found no real problem with mess so long as you make sure the bottom grind catcher is pushed in far enough. I have returned it.
2,You only get what you pay for.,"First of all, I will say that I use mine daily, and have thrown out my old blade grinder for this one. I like the 1 touch operation and the bean holder. What I don't like is the construction of the grind catcher. First of all, if you select the 12 cup setting, the grind bin overfills and clogs the entire unit. Why there is a setting that can't be used is beyond me. The grind catcher is also a little messy. There is a lot of ""coffee dust"" that floats all over the counter. You can dial various settings for a fine or coarse grind, but I don't really notice a difference in the outcome. I use a drip pot on occassion as well as a French press. The French press requires a more coarse grind, but the unit tends to give the same results as the setting that is recommended for the drip pot. If you are looking for a good burr grinder, this is not it. If you are looking for just any grinder, I think this is better than blade grinders at about the same price."
2,Melitta MEBG8B Coffee Mill,"My Melitta MEBG8B Coffee Mill just died unexpectedly in the middle of grinding coffee the other day. It was about a year old. It was nothing but trouble from the moment I received it. It was extremely messy. The kitchen counter and the floor, and ME were always covered with a spray of ground coffee with each use. It clogged up, even though I cleaned it every time I used it. It would arbitrarily clog up and the motor would smell like it was burning out. This was with regular, careful use. It is a poorly designed product, though when it does grind coffee, the ground coffee is acceptable. Please don't waste your money. Find something of better quality. This Melitta MEBG8B causes pure frustration with each use. Much more trouble than it is worth. I wish I had sent mine back."
4,Great grinder for the price,After buying an expensive Italian grinder I found it would not course grind Kona coffee because of the oils. The Melitta gives me a perfect grind for my French coffee maker.
5,Nice burr ginder for the money,I bought this grinder for my sister for Christmas. She loves it. She loves the fact that the push of a button and it messures the right amount of coffee and then just pour it into the coffee filter. I've since went back and bought one for my daughters birthday.
2,Very disappointing,"I purchased mine in an upscale kitchen store thinking it had had to be a good buy; I was wrong. No matter what grind you select, it's all the same. I too would run the grinds through twice with little result.Unless you can pick this model up at a garage sale, don't bother to get one"
1,Run away!,"I thought I couldn't go wrong with a burr grinder, I was mistaken. This grinder dances around the counter, the suction feet are of no use. It's insanely noisy. I have to hold it together when I do grind with it because the cup tries to fall off due to all of the shaking. Worst of all, the grind is inconsistent. I get fine grind mixed with chunks. I've owned this for about 2 years and it hasn't gotten a ton of usage at all. I'm replacing it with a Cuisinart Grind and Brew, at least I know that machine is reliable."
1,Sucks,"Really hate to be negative here, but this thing sucks. It's impossible to actually clean the old coffee from between the grinding burrs and the container that holds the ground coffee. The grind is extremely inconsistent. It makes a huge mess. After using it for 2 months, it jammed on a coffee bean and the motor burned out on me.You get what you pay for!"
1,Useless!,"I bought this grinder to go with a brand new Bialetti Moka Expreess espresso pot I received for Christmas. I've heard that burr mills are the best way to grind coffee. I wanted one, but I didn't want to spend big money. I wasn't expecting much for the price of this mill, but I thought, ""How bad could it be?"" Man, was I wrong! No matter how I adjusted this thing, the grind came out unusably coarse. It wouldn't grind fine enough for a percolator, much less espresso. Seriously, I could have done a better job with a hammer! It doesn't really deserve the one star I'm forced to give it. If you can't make coffee of any kind with what comes out of it, it's useless junk!"
2,won't grind very fine,"I returned the first one since it died after less than 2 weeks. Even before it died, the 18-position grind selector didn't seem to function and the coffee always came out pretty coarse. The replacement unit at least works, but it still is very coarse even on the finest setting. That said, the unit is otherwise pretty easy to use and clean."
3,Mill is only ok,This is a decent mill if you do not want a real find powder like grind for a real strong cup of coffee. I like my coffee strong and the powder grind delivers it. I would recommend finding a different model if this is what you want. Has anyone found a mill that will do this? Thanks
1,It's a Fire Hazard,"I've had this model for 9 months, at first I loved it and recommended it to my sisters and mother, both of whom now have one.About three months ago something inside the unit started to burn and it gave off a burning plastic smell when wires overheat. Now the switch sorta works (I poke switches at random until one starts it up), it does not shut off and I have to unplug it to turn it off.If you have this, leave it unplugged when not in use!Other that that, the grind is very nice but I never could figure out the timer feature (always too long). Sure beats the blade mills by a long shot!"
1,Don't buy this if you're an espresso drinker...,"I bought this grinder because Melitta advertised that it would be able to grind up to Espresso fineness, but when I used this product for the first time, I was very disappointed. Even at the lowest/espresso setting, I ended up with inconsistently sized coffee grounds - unfortunately, the majority of the grounds were much too coarse to be brewing espresso! It makes for a very watery espresso.This was fine for normal coffee, although the grounds were also inconsistently sized."
1,a waste of money,"I bought this as a step up from my 10-year-old Krups blade grinder. It was not an improvement. The Melita locked up after a few weeks' use. I had to take it apart and clean out all of the errant coffee grounds in the motor and wiring to get it to work again. I used it a few more weeks, then the same thing happened. When it WAS working, it clogged up easily, the lid was loose-fitting and really pointless, and the flimsy bin leaked coffee grounds when grinding. This is a terrible product."
1,Melitta Coffee Mill,This cheap product broke down in the second week of use and had to be replaced. A waste of money.
2,Lasted just about a month...,"I purchased this grinder because my other grinder ground too fine for my French press maker. This grinder did a good job grinding an appropriate grind for the press, but it only lasted 4 weeks and quit. The lid to the storage bin never fit properly either. Don't waste your time, get a different grinder.As a follow-up: I called Melitta to find out about the warranty. I was told that it was under warranty for one year. I told them it had quit working and they asked for my personal information, name, address, place of purchase, etc. The customer service rep said they needed a copy of the invoice where I purchased it, so I e-mailed it to her right away. Within 24 hours I have a brand new grinder setting in front of me. The grinder may be lacking but customer service is excellent."
1,Save your money- pass on this grinder!,"Yes - you heard me. It is a pain to clean - which you have to often because it will just stop working! First it will start to smoke and smell like burning circuit boards... then just ""grind to a halt"". To clean the fine dust out and dislodge a piece of stuck bean you have to unscrew three screws to get to the problem - and then screw it all back together and ""hope"" it works... Meanwhile you have just gotten your counter and sink black with fine dust from the grinds a real pain to clean up...and tomorrow it will do the same thing!NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY."
1,"deserves zero stars; poor design, messy to use, don't buy","I'd give this zero stars if Amazon permitted me to. If you do buy this--which I recommend you don't--be sure to use it in the kitchen sink where it'll be easy to clean up the mess. I grind about 2 week's worth of beans each time and make about four cups of ground coffee. Inevitably, the machine somehow sprays about 2 tablespoons of grounds all over the place (now in my sink since I've learned the hard way!) The nozzle where the grounds come out has also gotten jammed several times requiring digging the jammed grounds out with a knife, otherwise you risk burning the thing out. The top for the bean reservoir (sp?) is poorly designed and is difficult to grasp with thumb/finger. Get something else!!"
1,Is This Really A Melitta Product?,"I have used the Melitta System for 30 years. It makes the best coffee, but requires a fine consistent grind. This grinder is not Melitta quality. The product description says: ""Burrs grind coffee beans uniformly...18 grind selections, from very coarse to very fine for espresso."" None of that is true for the machine that I received. The machine breaks up the beans into chunks of inconsistent sizes, even on the finest grind setting. I suggest that Melitta recall the affected machines, and correct the problem to protect their good name. I am returning my machine in exchange for another model.Ric in Seattle"
2,Did not last 2 weeks,"I purchased this coffee grinder because it was a Melitta it had to be quality right? Wrong! The motor went bad after two weeks of use. I called the Co. they sent me a return slip with postage.But what do I grind my coffee with while I wait for them to return it? Maybe I got a lemon, the coffee ground well when it was working. The Adjustment from fine to courase also worked.It was worth $20.00 if it only lasted longer We will see how the one they send back to me works. I will let you know."
2,Thoroughly Disappointed,"Heeding the advice of so many internet barrista's, I decided to go for a burr coffee grinder. The theory is the blade grinders heat the coffee and somehow diminish the flavor. I was disappointed that this machine could not produce the fine grind I prefer. Even on the finest setting my coffee resembled a typical commercial grind - too coarse for my taste. Result - weak coffee. I'm going back to the cheap little whirlygig grinder I've used for years."
2,Acceptable Grinder,"Two very important things to consider for this grinder, 1) They kept the price down by making it mostly plastic so it is very flimsy. Ok for the home but don't think about trying to use this in an office, it wouldn't last a week. 2) Grinds the beans great if you only need it for a drip coffee maker but even at the highest recommended setting it doesn't come close to getting a good espresso grind. I run the beans through once at the highest setting and then have to grind it again in my blade grinder to get the fine grind you need for an espresso machine."
1,Don't expect any customer service from Melitta,Don't expect any customer service from Melitta. Burr mills are for grinding coffee very fine (espresso) to coarse. This one will not grind fine enough for espresso. I contacted Melitta and they referred me to the people that manufacture this product for them. Was put on hold for 22 minutes and then was told that some burr mills do not grind fine enough for espresso. They were unwilling to do anything. Called Melitta back and was basically told that I am stuck with it. They should not be able to label this as a burr mill. Another consumer ripoff by a company that does not care after the sale.
2,little grinder not quite up to task,"The glue on the Melita stop button does not hold, revealing a sticky mess. When you do press the button it sounds like it is crunching something in there. Even at the finest setting this grinder still allows some pretty big bits of bean to get through. A bigger hopper with a lid that would actually stay on would also be a huge improvement."
1,Caveat emptor: Piece of polyethylene crap,"As the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. The buttons stick, the lid (which one would expect to be secure, seeing as how it stores fresh coffee beans) wants to pop off at the slightest provocation, the plastic smells like it's melting while you grind, and all that is on the first use. I'd like to grind a ""4"" serving for espresso, but the button stuck on ""8,"" so I'll be drinking 8 cups at a time until I can buy a new grinder. Amazon, you should pull this item, and let some other vendor take the heat for having sold, to put it bluntly, a piece of crap."
2,A real letdown,"I purchased this grinder in spite of some of the poor reviews and ended up sending it right back to Amazon. I have had several coffee grinders and this one is the poorest performer of all. It only costs $20, but why spend $20 on a grinder that gives poor results when you can get a blade grinder for $10 that does a much better job? This Melitta coffee mill purports to grind from fine to coarse but in reality only grinds to a course consistency. I sent this item back as defective because the product information clearly states ""18 grind selections, from very coarse to very fine for espresso."" This is clearly not accurate. I hope to get my shipping cost back. Anyway, it's a nice looking product but simply doesn't perform as expected."
4,Works great for my daily cappachino,"I have a blade grinder, and was not getting the uniform fine grind that I needed for the espresso for my cappuccino, so I purchased the Melita. I have it set at 15 and it makes a perfect grind for my machine and tamps perfectly. I agree it does have static electricity, but I tap it on a papertowel a few times before opening and don't have the problem. I am also carefull to keep the area between the grinder and holding container clean. All in all for the money you can't beat the grind..I am very happy with it."
4,The Burr Grinder Budget Bargain,"A nice little machine for the price. It quickly delivers the amount and type of grind you desire. Unfortunately, this grinder spews coffee dust out both sides like a volcano. This problem is easily remedied by placing a piece of saran wrap around the Ground Coffee Chamber before grinding. This is an OK grinder for grinding a week's worth of coffee/espresso at a time, but the clean up is just too messy for a daily grind. I don't know if more expensive grinders are neater, but no other grinder does the job any cheaper. Brew on!"
3,R. Johnson is the man,"I purchased this about 3 weeks ago with the understanding that I would tweak it before I ever used it. I followed R. Johnson's clear directions and it works great. We use it 3 times a day with no real complaints.Is it loud? It is a coffee grinder. No louder or quieter than any I have owned or used in the past.The consistency of the grind is not perfect. To me this is not so big of a deal. For $20 I'm not complaining. It's close enough for government work.So if you're wondering if you should, get a screwdriver and go for it. You can do it!"
3,"Better available? YES, but you'll have to spend 4X more!","Got this unit a year or so ago and have had little problem with it. Yes the gring settings are not exact, I keep mine second from the finest setting and it works wonderful for my Krups ProAroma machine (another reccomended buy!). I use this grinder 6 times a week and the only gripe is having to clean up escaping grounds from the container below. Some of the ground coffee escapes out the sides as there is no seal, just a plastic to plastic fit. I just have a cordless vac I break out and clean up, no big deal. It is noisy, but show me an electric grinder that isn't and I'll show you a deaf person. I would buy it again!"
1,"I agree, don't buy it! Wish I had read reviews first","Every review of this product is correct, I just wish I had researched this before I purchased, but I bought it on a whim because it was only $26. Well, now that I have used it 3 times it does not work at all, so I guess that only add $12 to the cost of each pot of coffee I made with it. For $26 I didn't expect it to last forever, but I did expect it to last through one bag of coffee."
1,"A classic example of ""you get what you pay for""","First, be prepared for the grinder to spit coffee grounds out all over the place when you grind the beans. The design of the plastic grounds catcher is defective; the gaps cause the machine to spew grounds everywhere. It has 18 settings but they really make very little difference in the grind. You pretty much get large chunks or perk grind with this. The grind is way too coarse for my drip coffee maker. The grinder is useless for grinding espresso. You will end up wasting a lot of coffee with this so in the long run, it pays to get a top quality burr grinder. This isn't it. This is an awful product."
2,GRIND IT BABY!,"I WAS LIKING THE CONCEPT, BUT THE GRINDER DOESN'T GRIND TO A FINE CONSISTENCY AND IT IS MESSY. IF SOMEONE COULD COME UP WITH A FINER GRAIN AND NOT MESSY TO UNLOAD IT, I WOULD BE THRILLED!"
3,"Great for coffee only, not for espresso","Although this is a mill grinder, it will not produce a fine enough grind for espesso machines. It's ok for filtered coffee and has a few bells and whistles. Skip it if you're looking for an espresso grind."
3,Still to Kiddie,"This short series could have been better, I don't understand why the Japanese feel the need to have all the main characters children or little girls, Of course this is not true for Macros Plus which is one of the best animation out there, maybe it's because they left the kids at home."
2,Flopped chopper,I was so excited to get this chopper...until I started using it :-( unfortunately the veggies get jammed in between the double blades so I spent more time trying to pry out the food than chopping it
3,it's OK,the blades are too close together so the salad material gets clogged up between the blades and comes up into the hand held area. you have to stop every few chops to clear the blades with a butter knife. it cuts up the salad nicely but the clogging makes it a real pain to use
2,Mmmmm?,Works fine on chopping but you spend a lot of time cleaning the food out of the inside of the blades.
2,Nothing you haven't seen before,"Though Coover is undeniably a talented writer, he decides to take a very well-worn path for this book. It's a deconstructed fairy tale, one of approximately 18 billion, and the themes are familiar. Yes, the old stories were often appallingly misogynist and affirmed rigid patriarchal values, including a distrust of the other and the outsider. Yes, this was bad. Coover scores some points for not completely inverting everything- the witches aren't quite innocent, just no more brutal than everyone else- but the whole story is pretty one-note and forgettable. It offers nothing new, it just deconstructs the old, and without offering real change it's simply a grim and ugly affair."
2,Bad Girl Gone Good,"First - I borrowed this from the library and it had so many typos that it distracted me from the story. It seemed like I found a typo on every other page.Second - I did not like the changes in Jana. I would have preferred Ray creating a tale about the devious Jana than having her turn into Saint Jana. Devious Jana would have made a more interesting story.Third - The constant mention of ""the changes in Jana"" and ""the new Jana"" - overkill.Fourth - The ""romance story with the happy ending"" format that works so well in other Ray books that I have read just didn't work for me here. I understand that people can change and writing about the positives in people, but for Jana to have raised all of that ruckus in ""Like The First Time"" and then to portray her as a woman on the verge of sainthood here - yuck!"
4,Predictable but Entertaining,"This is my first time reading a Francis Ray novel and it won't be my last. I couldn't put this book down. I was done in two days. The book is about Jana a woman that goes from a gold digging hoe to a reformed and polished woman. Olivia is broke and nearly living on the streets when she is rescued by Olivia a linen store owner. Olivia gives Jana a second chance despite her shady past. Jana finds herself falling in love with Tyler. Will Jana accept love when she has never been loved before or will she turn to her old ways. Although I really liked this book the plot was predictable at times. It seemed like the same theme of will Jana change or not kept repeating itself. Nonetheless the book was quite good. Also, although this book is by an African American author its not perse a typical Eric Jerome Dickey novel. Its more along the lines of Connie Briscoe or Mary Morrison. Enjoy."
5,Reap what you sow....,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Jana Franklin (bit character with a lot of 'tude) from Like the First Time has reaped a lot of heartache on people. This is her story. If I told more you wouldn't want to read it but read it you must.
4,Nice Keyboard,"I got this keyboard because it was on sale and needed a replacement for all my beige PS/2 ones. This does the job well and bucks the tired trend of ""laptop key"" keyboards. These keys have a decent depth and feel.The appearance is pleasing -- a little curvy with some trendy piano black trim.The only bummer is the Home/End/Pg Up key placement is a little wonky and takes some getting used to. But it does keep the footprint a little narrower."
3,"Cheap Compact, but adequate","PRO :Classic and cheap keyboard without all the short-cut add-ons that a lot of vendors keep slapping onto newer and expensive keyboards. Also it is usb and not the aging ps2 that a lot of keyboards were.CON:-keys are not soft compared to the HP keyboards at my university, and the one on my dell 700m.-The keys are designed very close together, so there doesn't seem to be much of a gap between them. This might prove good for cleaning, since not alot debris can fall in the gaps.-With the above 2 CONS, it seems I am more prone to mistyping on this keyboard. May have to get a different one soon.-The home, insert, page layout is compact and gets confusing if you are use to a full size keyboard layout."
1,Tiny keys; No incline,"Overall a bad product. The keyboard has no functional problems. But it does not incline at all since its 2 'legs' are tiny. Also the lettering o the keys is very very small and the keys themselves look smaller than a nomal keyboard. Plus I don't like it's layout: Small enter key, odd positioning of Home, End buttons"
3,"Basic decent keyboard, duplicates letters here and there...","I type close to 100wpm. That means that I have zero tollerance for imperfect keyboards. When my old and trusty Logitech keyboard starting dying, I ordered two new ones, hoping that at least one would be good. The first one, model 120, was crap. It duplicates lettters due to bad springs too often. This one, on the other hand, started of great withh no letters being duplicated. About a week after using it, I can see that it is slowly starting to duplicate letters as well. You can see that in this review two words so far have duplicated letters (""withh"" and ""lettters"").[...]"
2,Keys misplaced,"I was not very impressed with this keyboard. The alphabets are smaller than usual and the del the insert and the home keys (on the middle patch) are in different places. Take a clear look at a large image of this keyboard before buying it. I find it very frustrating to hit the wrong keys in the middle patch (delete, insert, home, end). I am not sure why this keyboard is so costly. Maybe just because of its shape and the logitech name. A $5 kensington will do the job equally well. I am not sure why Logitech has taken it upon themselves to tweak the layout of keys in their their offerings."
3,Good average desktop keyboard,"Bought this to replace an old keyboard that all the letters had rubbed off of. This is a decent basic wired keyboard with decent build quality. All button presses are solid and reaffirming.After a couple of years of use, this keyboard is headed in the same direction as the one before it: all the letters are rubbed off. Why manufacturers can not build a basic, no-frills, keyboard with paint that lasts more than a year is beyond me."
2,cheap keyboard and cheap key strokes,"no buffer on the keys but it is very cheap and very compact. smaller than most and very thing as well. i like it, except it feels cheap when you type on it and feel like it will break soon. the keys are not cushioned. it feels like a spring."
4,Good keyboard,"I might rate this key board even higher after I have had it a bit longer and had time to explore its full potential. Presently I only use in a very basic manner.I decided to replace my wireless mouse and key board because they were both lathargic on occasion due to some kind of interference. It occurred to me that if you intend to use your mouse and keyboard while sitting in front of a desk top computer, being wireless is of no real value to you. Plus you have batteries to replace from time to time.Another thing. I am a pretty good typist and the keys on this key board allow for faster, more error free typing."
5,Basic USB keyboard does the job well,"True to its name, the Logitech Classic Keyboard is a throwback to their heritage; a straightforward model requiring no special software, without any extra keys or controls. The keys have a slightly-firm springy responsiveness with audible feedback (a slight, but non-intrusive clatter).Compared to the basic USB keyboard that Dell ships with all its desktop PCs, the Classic's keys are springier, the spacing is a little less dense (which fits my fingers better), and the boundary around the actual keys is more asthetically pleasing in contrast to the sparseness of the Dell keyboard.This model is shaped slightly differently than the otherwise identicalLogitech Classic KeyboardPS/2 model; the trim on the side towards the user is a little narrower, allowing proper use of a wrist-rest, which was a minor drawback on the PS/2 model.This is a basic keyboard with nice feedback and a low price. It's hard to go wrong here."
4,Works good,"Works good, and the price is hard to beat. I bought two of em - one for the Mac and one for the PC."
3,Good keyboard with two little problems,"For most people this would probably be the perfect keyboard for the price, but if you use the editor VI (VIM, or GVIM), then you are going to be hitting the escape key all day long. Trouble is, on this keyboard, the escape key feels slightly out of reach. I keep having to move my hand, which I find disconcerting. On my Dell compact keyboard that I use at work, I have no problem reaching the escape key. Same thing with most other keyboards.This keyboard doesn't slope quite enough. They claim this is a feature, but I am less comfortable with it.The keyboard is pretty thin, making it look a little cheaper, but in terms of typing it feels solid enough.If all you are doing is word processing, emails etc., I don't see much problem with this keyboard. However, computer professionals like myself might want something that feels more traditional."
4,Cheap keyboard that gets the job done.,Needed a new keyboard and this works like a charm. Bought it over a year ago and it feels and works great. I can't see why anyone would spend a lot of money on a USB keyboard. This works and looks perfect. I use it on a MAC Mini so don't be sucked into a $60 white Mac keyboard because they are tough to type on.
2,Larger than size,I ordered a half size smaller than my size based on reviews and the shoes were still way too big. A comparable sizing chart is needed or guidance from Rieker that their shoes fit an ? size bigger than US sizes. I didn't bother to exhange for the next smaller size.
2,Editor ?,"This is a beautifully illustrated book, but I stopped short when I got to page 10 of the introduction. The caption says that it is a picture of Lance Armstrong entering Paris. It clearly is not, it is a mountain stage. With such an obvious mistake it calls into question the content of the entire book. Sloppy."
5,Great,"It's tremendous buying so cheaply. It works fine. Since several of my friends have asked me to acquire the reference also, since the price is excellent."
3,He needs an editor,"I enjoyed the book over all. The pictures and the old facts and history that came with the book were great. But in my opinion their was way to much filler, I skimmed through some things that just went on and on that again in my opinion didn't need to be in the book. It made it a little stagnate to get through.I am currently reading his other book The Lost Cyclist, so far it's a little better at keeping me involved. Their are still times I feel like I'm reading a text book though. Love riding, glad someone's there to write about it."
5,Great photos of the different bikes,"Bought as a gift for my Dad, the quality of photographs are really nice. Didn't get a chance to read it, not sure if my father has yet."
3,"""THE HIstory?"" no, American and Western European history","Hello,The book contains many beautiful photos and the author has done an excellent job of writing about cycling history. To call it ""Bicycle: THE History"" when only 1 page out of 480 pages mentions (briefly) India and China, two lands with rich bicycle traditions and where a 1/4 of all people on earth live, (of which many are cyclists) is like calling a book ""Christianity: THE history"" and then forgetting to mention anything but the Catholic church. Hopeful the author will correct this in a future edition."
2,Not a new item and maximum wattage incorrectly rated!,"This is a very pretty chandelier, but be warned that this is NOT A NEW ITEM and is rated for 40 watt bulbs maximum, not 60 watts as described here. Even 40 watt bulbs are very difficult to fit in it and press against the glass shade. I returned the first one since it would not hold together because of a previously stripped-out screw hole in the fixture. Amazon sent a replacement, but that one, too, had obviously been installed before as there were small chips in the paint and glass shade, plus the ends of the wires had been stripped, twisted, and slightly corroded. In addition, the wire and chain is too short if you have high ceilings. I had to re-wire the entire fixture and replace the chain which, unfortunately, can not be found in the same finish. I do not think this chandelier is a good value since I could have bought a used chandelier from my local thrift shop for a lot less money!"
4,Nice looking light,"Unlike the other reviewer, I did not have as many problems with my light. It looks beautiful installed above my staircase. It is designed for A15 lights (aka ceiling fan lightbulbs), not the traditional el-cheapo ones - they would hit the glass shade as the other reviewer described.The only problem I had with the light was that I had to pry open a link in each end of the chain to connect it to both the light and the ceiling mount. This is the only reason for not giving it 5 stars, as that was quite a pain!"
2,picture looks better,"Item arrived with critical parts missing, had to piecemeal it together and doesn't quite look right. Not very sturdy construction. Does give off a nice glow."
3,Not bad,"The light looks nice, was easy to install. The only thing is the darker dome makes the room look dull and the size of the bulb has to be small, it will take a standard build but with a smaller profile. But for the price I paid, I am happy with it."
3,Great looks for the price...,"This is a great looking light and for the price it can't be beat...however, it's a pain to put together and you have to becareful to make sure everything is even...that said, it looks great."
3,"great look, uncomfortable sheets","I own this set. It looks nice but I tossed the sheets. Even after 2 washings, they were still uncomfortable. The set is actually more muted tones than the picture shows."
4,"unknown, but worth getting to know!","A must have for any DJ or avid listener into the silky soft sounds of the lounge jazz scene. Bluetrain is hybrid of lush sounds that will hold you until the last martini is gone. Although relatively unknown, your collection should not go without knowing this group!"
4,A Real Gem,"What an engaging collection of stories. This little tome is a gem - perfect to curl up with on a rainy afternoon. The author has chosen an especially fitting title in that these are not so much ""stories"" as ""fables"" - each containing a kernel of truth gleaned from his own reflection and introspection. I daresay that some of Mr. Gressett's tales will evoke memories from the reader's own past, for many are universal in nature, if not in particular. I enjoyed this book and recommend it to others."
5,The Cliff Notes were great!,"I was forced to read this in my English class. I read both the book and the Cliff Notes. The book was too drawn out. I really don't care about a bunch of stupid sheep and pastoral scenery. The plot, however was really good. I read the book first and almost died of boredom, but when I read the Cliff Notes, I was swept up in the story line. I guess I just needed something to get over Hardy's long-winded style to see the wonderful story beneath. But, even with the stupid stuff removed, I still wanted to slap Bathsheba. (How can she be so incredibly BLIND!) If you read the book (or better yet, the Cliff Notes), you'll understand. The most annoying part of this book was that the person who got the high on the test only read the Cliff Notes."
3,"Extremely long, but the storyline is cool.","Although the book was indeed long, the storyline was interesting and the detail and description broadened my vocabulary. If you are still in high school, you probably ought nought to read it, simply because you are not mature enough to appreciate Hardy's brilliance."
5,Lo Michael,This was an excellent book that I would highly recommend. A young boy from the slums that keeps his promise to his friends when he is taken from the nasty living on the streets. I had a hard time putting the book down I kept wanting to read what he would do next.
2,disappointing,"Other books by this author I have enjoyed, but this one for me is unbelievable. First of all, it is hard to read with all of that Irish brogue dialogue. I actually ended up skipping much of it. And the continual same old, same old description of the golden haired boy is tiresome. I rarely give up on reading a book to its conclusion, but will have to admit that I am giving up on this one. I can imagine what the outcome will be without having to read all the tiresome descriptions."
3,"Good Plot, disappointing characters","You must suspend a great deal of disbelief for this story. Michael is practically flawless, Starr's mother is definitely without a redeeming characteristic. Starr and the father are more believable. I thought it was a great plot idea and enjoyed the story. I was just really disappointed in the main character. Unless he was Jesus Christ, he could not have become the man Hill made him out to be without any close, warm relationships in his youth.I also personally missed the overt Christian theme (present in most of her novels) which would have helped to make the moral transformation of some of the ""street urchins"" more believable."
3,Keeps you interested,Not one of Grace Livingston Hill's best books in my opinion but never the less it was pretty good. I really enjoyed some of the characters while others were just frustrating. It seemed a bit long and drug out to me but it is difficult to find a Grace Livingston Hill book I really dislike. Although this had good people in it it didn't refer to Christianity or God as often as some of her others do. I like best the books that teach a little about God and what the Christian life is really about. Would highly recommend The Enchanted Barn.
1,Esqueleto,This movie is incorrect....you advertise this movie as an Amparo Rivelles movie and is not...she is not on this movie. I requested EL ESQUELETO DE LA SENORA MORALES which is the correct movie where Amparo Rivelles is the main actress...but you send me ESQUELETO this unkonwn movie...two times. Already returned both movies..hope you will credit me asap.Gustavo Young
5,Any Book by Miller,"Any book by Calvin is to a fertile mind what chocalate fudge is to a kid. You can taste every word, feel every nuance, and realize that-at last-you have discovered a true Jesus man. He is just that. I am his neighbor at his mountain home in Glorieta, NM. I watch him closely. He is a wonderful sermon, walking around. We all love Calvin, Barbara, the kids, and Kaiser, their dog. Sell your horse and by ALL of Calvin's books-then you will wexperience what we do. He is the one whom than whom there is no whom-er Jess Moody"
5,God is glorified,"The most elementary courtesy requires that we accept an author's right to say what he wants to say, not what we want him to (we can always write our own books, after all).Calvin Miller is out to glorify God, and to help others to see His glory. He succeeds brilliantly. There is an immense breadth of material here, all of it excellent, and when brought together in one volume, the effect is overwhelming."
3,"All in all good, but lacking in ""characterization""","At first glance, this book looks great. Very thick and very full of articles about Jesus. However I was a little dismayed when I found that all except for less than a handful were by fundamental christian types. The title is ""a Book of Jesus"" so I think the author would have been best off to keep the fundies but also add other writers in as well. It wouldnt hurt to have metaphysical and esoteric christian write about Jesus. or to have a Muslim speak about Jesus in an edifying way. Dont get me wrong, the book is nice....but it remains a little too fluffy. Its time we start being more Unified. We need to see that Jesus is a main figure of course in Christianity, Fundamental and Liberal, Muslim, Buddhism, Hindu, Taoist, Mystical. If we can incorporate all those views, then we certainly have a ""Book of Jesus."""
5,A Must Have!,"Dark, robust, cutting edge, cool, and classic are only a few words that can describe this ""have-to-see"" version of a future batman. If your a fan or just looking for something new, the batman beyond series is right for you."
2,mediocre,This is batman at his worst. I love batman but this is nothing like Batman that I've ever seen. He's supposed to be Batman from the future. But I have a hard time seeing him as batman at all. There's a different voice too. It's not Kevin Conroy. I've grown to love Kevin's voice as Batman. This show is mediocre at best.
3,worthy continuation of the batman's adventures,ok when i first saw this show i was very skeptical..i come from the batman the animated series old school...after watching the return of the joker film ..i was impressed . the show fast forwards 20 yrs later after bruce wayne retires from being the batman(still voiced to perfection by kevin conroy)..and we find that wayne has a new protege..and new high tech weapons . this is a worty follow up to BTAS and is worth a look...although the storylines could have been better thoughps its cool to see wayne's dog ace from the early 90s books in the show as well.
4,Needs live movie!,"I like Terry as the new Batman. He's young(er than when Bruce was Batman), hip and full of flaws. He kind a give the human-aspect to the old Batman. There are a few ""old enemies"" but the new ones are pretty solid. None, though, stands up to the original Batman's nemesis. Regardless, it's a good series."
3,sediment,"I like the looks and ease of use of this coffee maker. It is also easier to clean than my previous combo machine. But I wasn't prepared for the gold filter basket being the only option - you cannot use any paper filters, and therefore you get sediment in the bottom of the cup and carafe. Also, the thermal carafe does NOT keep the coffee as hot as my separate thermos carafe does, so the coffee left over from breakfast is cold by lunchtime. So it is not worth the extra $49 to get the thermal model."
3,Coffee Should Be HOT!,"Fresh ground coffee is very nice but this coffee maker does not produce hot coffee. I was surprised that the coffee was warm but not hot. You can drink it without hesitation. No sipping needed. If you add cream or milk, then it really cools it off. There really should be a temperature switch so the user can set it to their taste.So brew your fresh coffee and then microwave it so it is hot!"
2,poor design,Coffee is OK but nothing to jump up and down about. Small plastic tab has broken off after 3 months of use making the coffee maker useless. I would not buy this again. This is definitely something that should have been designed better.
2,Great Coffee-Poor Design,"I have had this coffee maker for 9 months now. I feel the coffee could be hotter. The carafe should be designed to pour faster. It is easy enough to clean. I really like it except for one thing. It broke. That is-the latch on the lid that covers the grinder/basket. Without this latch working nothing happens. You see-the cover has to stay latched in order to depress a pin in order to brew coffee. So now . . . I have this ugly bungy cord pulling this cover down so that the coffee maker will still brew coffee. I would not buy this one again because of this one thing, Poor design!"
2,What a Mess,"I do enjoy the coffee, and love the built in grinder. My major complaint is the awful mess generated by this coffee maker. It seems to leak from everywhere, including the handle. I finally had to pack it away, where I will most likely throw it out in my next big cleaning. Another smaller complaint would be that the coffee is not especially hot, but my biggest complaint is just the mess. I tried to convince myself for months that it was worth it, but it just is not worth having to clean my kitchen counter between the coffee maker and the sink (and the floor as well) every time I make coffee."
4,Couldn't Wait To Taste It,"Biggest drawback so far: the instructions don't state WHICH end (1 or 7) of the 7 mill settings will brew the coffee the strongest vs the weakest. Rather than the trial and error way, I checked this website's customer reviews to find out. I recently bought a Mr. Coffee thermal carafe coffee maker and I hated(!) it. Even after a month of daily use, I could still taste plastic in my coffee. I only received this product today, and, so far, so good; no icky plastic taste, great placement of water reservoir, and the coffee tastes very good. I can not wait until tomorrow to wake up to the whir of fresh coffee being milled."
3,Good taste though coffee is not quite hot enough,"The initial temperature is probably fine for those who drink their coffee black, but for anyone else it's a bit frustrating as the fresh ground taste is quite good."
2,"Poor design, it will break on you","Used this for nearly a year and loved it, then like so many other reviews here, the latch broke and the machine becomes almost useless (I now put a heavy empty glass on top of it to hold it down while brewing) It won't fucntion if not latched, hence until I find a new machine, I am using the glass.Though this machine has a lot of good qualities, it won't hold up, and I have also noted that the filter basket is not ever replaceable, which is ridiculous. This machine will be a good buy if you plan to die in the next year, otherwise, take my advice and look elsewhere.Sorry Melitta, but just a little more common sense in your design and plans and you would have had a solid winner here. As it is, its not a wise investment at all."
1,Not happy,"When I purchased this less than 18 months ago, I paid over $100. It made good coffee. I would have liked the pot to keep it warmer a little longer - but I REALLY expected it to last longer than 18 months! I have not over-used the unit. Many days I did not make coffee in it at all. Today, it will NOT heat/brew at all. It still grinds the beans, but that is the end of it - Coffee beans without ""water added"" really do not make a very satisfying drink! I certainly will avoid another Melita product, might as well go back to a $25, discount store special!"
4,Great coffee maker but it doesn't get or stay very hot,"I really like this coffee maker. Waking up to freshly ground fresh brewed coffee has never before been this easy. The flavor of the beans really shine with this machine. However, as I imagine is the case with all thermal carafe machines, the coffee is never piping hot, and unless there is a significant amount of coffe in the carafe it cools down very quickly. Like other reviewers I have resorted to microwaving my coffee to reheat it.I still would not trade this coffee maker for any other I have tried."
2,Such a nice unit...too bad about the carafe,"We bought this coffee maker after years with a Black and Decker model that was a workhorse. We liked the idea of less mess with a built in grinder. The brewing/grinding unit works perfectly for us although it is more work to clean and does seem to grind beyond what is necessary. But the carafe is the biggest drawback and that's why we give it 2 stars! I can't tell you how many times I have dumped the entire pot all over my counter because I turned the lid a fraction too far. If you don't turn it enough, you only get a small trickle. Very frustrating.Doesn't seem like rocket science to me. If you spend that much on a coffeemaker, you should expect a better designed carafe.And now a year after owning it the lid latch has broken and won't brew unless something heavy is placed on top to keep it down. This seems to be a planned obsolescence feature as I have read at least a dozen or more reviews that mention the same thing after a year of owning. Hummm...."
1,Worst tasting coffee I've ever had,"I just received this coffeemaker yesterday. I have made six pots of coffee trying different grinding settings, different amounts of coffee and I have yet to get even one cup that is drinkable. The coffee is weak and bitter tasting. I have been using a Cuisinart Grind and Brew which makes wonderful coffee but the glass carafe broke recently so I thought I would try the Melitta Mill and Brew with the Stainless carafe. You cannot pour a cup of coffee without taking the lid completely off and it still leaks coffee all over the counter. Melitta you better go back to the drawing board on this one!"
1,COLD COFFEE,Just purchased this coffee maker and frankly I want to send it back. It is not the Quality but the coffee gets cold in the pot. NOT GOOD
2,Sorry I Invested in this Coffeemaker,I'm sorry that I paid the eighty (80) dollars for this coffeemaker. The coffee is not any better than my way less expensive coffeemaker. It is NOT user friendly either. The biggest complaint that I have is that NO PARTS can be put in the dishwasher! I'm going back to my four cup Mr. Coffee.
3,It almost has it all....,"This product comes the closest to what I am looking for. I thought this was it based on its title: ""Mill & Brew..."" I would love to purchase a coffee maker that MILLS, brews and drips into a stainless steel carfe. It would also be nice if it were programable (which this is). Upon further investigation, this says BLADE grinder-milling beans is so much better. The beans go through once instead of round and round...heating up...etc. Too bad!!! Still looking..."
4,very nice coffeemaker/bean grinder,"I own the one with a see-through caraffe and just bought my dad the one with the stainless steel caraffe. I've never had a malfunction, the timer is easy to set, and it's easy to clean in the dishwasher. My only ""gripe"" is I can't figure out a way to disengage the automatic shut-off. It shuts off after an hour and I tend to drink about 3 cups throughout the day so I end up reheating my second and third cups in the microwave. Nevertheless, I'd still buy this brand again if I ever needed to replace it."
1,ALL ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS BREAK WITHIN 4 MONTHS,We acutally liked the unit very much until after 4 months of purchase the plastic Mill/Brew Assembly Lid lock broke off; the Carafe lost its heat rentention; and the Grinder no longer ground. To add insult to injury the company Salton takes back the machine in total--no replacement parts sent--in a 4-6 week turnaround.(either buy a new machine or go without making morning coffee for that time!!)and will only either fix or replace with a refurbished unit (someone elses old coffee unit???)Something not right here. Suggestion and rating: AVOID
3,Melitta Coffeemaker not that hot,Makes great coffee.... my only issue is that the coffee temperature is not hot enough for my liking.
1,Leak! Leak! Leak!,I looked forward to receiving this product after having read the editorial review. I have now received 3 of this product and every one leaked profusely. There's a serious design flaw. Amazon was great about accepting returns and replacing the product but Melitta customer service was not. They reluctantly agreed to let me ship one to them for testing ( I am still awaiting their solution after 3 weeks of waiting) but had insisted that they were built specifically for Amazon and I needed to work things out with Amazon. I'm still waiting!
1,Disappointed,"I should have believed the negative consumer reviews, which were the majority, before odering. The coffee did not brew very hot and the stainless carafe leaked from the seams around the black plastic upper part of the carafe when pouring coffee. I am going to try another manufacturer's model coffee maker and regret having purchased the Melitta Mill & Brew coffeemaker."
4,Good Coffee But Not Hot Enough,"If you like your coffee real hot, then this isn't the coffee maker for you. Even after preheating the carafe, using tepid water, and warming up the coffee mug with hot water, I still couldn't get it hot enough. The first cup was ok, but after that, I had to heat each cup in the microwave. Maybe it's because I'm just making half of a pot but it should still stay hotter longer."
1,coffee lover,We had our coffeemaker for 2 months and it started leaking. We contacted Melitta and they send us a new part. It lasted one month. They finally sent us a new unit and it lasted one month. We really like the design and got many coments from friends but something is wrong. I read all the reviews and chose it because no one listed any mechanical problems. Something must have happened somewhere in the production line. I hope they are able to fix the problem it did make a good cup of coffee.
2,Not Hot,"I just returned this machine after a few days. It grinds fine but trust me, it does not get hot enough. My wife who is not a big coffee drinker looked at me and said the coffee is not hot enough. You can chug it if you want too. We preheated the carafe with hot water and it still did not help.Too much of a pain."
2,A great idea while it lasted,"This product is scheduled to return to the US market in January 2006 - don't buy it. I spent $70.00 on a product that I may have got 20x use out of; I'm not impressed and will be returning to a grinder and coffee press (the 'keep it simple, stupid' approach).I owned one of these models for 3 years, it received light use during that time and I thought it was a wonderful machine until about a month ago when it began to percolate very slowly, generated a lot of steam, and would not turn off when all the water had boiled.I de-scaled it according to manufacturer's instructions with vinegar (old housewives' standby) and CLR, there is no improvement. I'm guessing that the thermostat has blown but there is no obvious way to take the machine apart to find out what is going on, or to clean/replace the part.I'm not impressed with the manufacturer's problem-solving instructions or the customer service provided by Seton (USA importers)."
5,Great Product,"My daughters love this Aqua doodle, the puzzle pieces and stencils make it more enjoyable for longer playing time! I would recommend this, until puzzle pieces come up missing, but so far so good."
3,"2nd Symphony one of the best, 4th cool and emotionally flat","I have owned this CD for a very long time. The performance of the 2nd symphony is brilliant with lots of passion and excitement. The 4th is very cool with very little emotion. It is Tchaikovsky played in the style of Haydn and Mozart. In my opinion, it does not work. Next to the Pathetique, the 4th is Tchaikovsky's most emotional symphony. It needs passion to work. If you want a great recording of the 4th with superior playing I would suggest Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra. And it is really passionate."
4,Electronic keyboard,"I ordered it in black and was shipped blue, but other than that it is a great keyboard for the money. I am not sure who has more fun playing with it- my daughter or my husband and I."
1,Priced too high,"This is a very cheaply made keyboard that should probably go for $25 or less. The volume control doesn't work for the mic, which is ear-piercingly loud, and the volume buttons are incorrectly placed (the ""volume up"" button is pointing to the left and the ""volume down"" is pointing to the right) which can be very confusing for children who are learning. It didn't even come in black; it was royal blue which makes it look as cheap as it sounds."
1,It doesn't play the notes you press.,"I bought this having read all the reviews. If they had all been true, including the cheapness of the buttons, and the volume level limitations, it would have suited my needs very well. Nobody mentioned however that it has a serious software bug that causes irrelevant notes to sound when keys are pushed.If you play a simple C major 7 chord: c e g bflat, the instant you play the bflat a d and an f sound as well. Most four or more note chords are corrupted with spurious notes added. This would be very confusing for a beginner and makes the keyboard utterly useless as a harmonic instrument."
1,"i would not promote this item, or seller","I received this item on September 30, 2009. I had intended to use this product as part of an architectural project, thus I thought it's low-tech design would work. The output jack was not functional and the keyboard in general looks like a toy I had in the 80's. I returned my item promptly and have still not received a refund. To say the least, I would not suggest purchasing this item, nor would I promote this seller."
2,Damaged,"The toy was sent tome already damaged, the supplier never did the devolution of the money or an exchange for other toy.I wouldn't recommend anymore the supplier."
5,Women of the cloth,"What a beautiful book of how simple nuns were able to help women and children in the 1880's. Even though it was a male-priest dominated society, these uneducated women, clothed in black that only showed their face and hands and living under a medieval dictate were able to thrive. As a child I was taught by this order in New York City and always knew that these quiet women were a force to behold. Thank you, Sisters of Charity for quietly relieving the city's poor. Your history was and will never be taught in the Catholic schools. I always knew you could do anything you put your mind to."
5,Would love more games like this!,"This is one of the first computer games that my 6-year-old could master on her own while still having a lot of fun. There are 3 levels of difficulty, so she could keep playing as she bagan mastering the game. Probably not very challenging for a 7-year-old, but it may depend on how many games they've played before. Graphics and sound are really good for someone at this age level. No ""cheats"" needed, but still a lot of fun!"
1,"Chopped way to small, almost dust not chips","This is nothing like the aspen bedding I'm used to using. Rather than it being chips or shavings, its chopped into very small pieces - similar to saw dust. Much finer than shown on the photo. As a result, it does not fluff up and can not be tunneled through and the particles are so small that it can be inhaled into the nasal lining and lungs of anything living in it.Not a good value."
2,Guitar Songs,"Although the listing said it works with Windows XP, it does not. I purchased the Guitar Songs 1 version 2.0 edition. It did not work with XP at all. I am wondering if there is a version that will work with XP. Be careful before you purchase it!!"
2,Disappointed,"When I saw this watch on line, I thought it would be perfect, small, stylish, simple. However after ordering and receiving it, I was quite disappointed. The case depth is quite thick for a small watch, and the metal looks very inexpensive. The strap is so thin, instead of looking delicate, it seems out of proportion with the thick round case of the watch itself. I'm glad that those who wrote the other reviews liked their purchase, but I wanted to share a different perspective. I returned it. For those looking for a small, modestly priced timex watch, I'd go with the Cavatina line (the smaller version) which is much finer looking in person.Timex Women's T2M566 Cavatina Gold-Tone Case Black Leather White Dial Watch"
2,Looks like a child's watch,"This watch is pretty but it's so small that it looks like it's made for a child, not an adult. I think there is a fine line between delicate and childish, and this definitely veers more into the childish realm than the delicate."
1,Didn't work,Watch didn't work when I received it and it was a Christmas present for my Mom. I took it to the jewelers to get battery changed and it still wouldn't work. I notified Amazon and asked for a replacement watch and they made it very simple to return the watch. I'm waiting for the replacement watch to show up. Hope it works! Very seldom receive anything defective from Amazon.
4,Perfect for slim wrists,"I was looking for an everyday use, my wrists are really slim and bulky watched look strange.This watch fits perfectly. I only gave 4 stars as its too soon to determine how it works."
5,Great game,"Great fun. Only MW series that works flawless on XP, and runs beautifully on a reasonably new computer."
2,Does not contain all the stories,This edition is missing several of the stories originally published in the collection. Don't buy if you want the complete story collection.
5,the best,Paul Wilbur's music is the best of the messianic genre. He has a beautiful voice and the music is always wonderfully orchestrated. The songs convey deep truths about the Lord and move me to tears. I have all of his CDs and each one is a treasure.
1,Never failed!,"Siempre he comprado memorias Corsair y nunca me han decepcionado, son excelentes, aunke sabemos ke ninguna memoria garantiza un OC al 100%, pero Corsair es confiable y rendidora."
1,Get what you pay for ...,When mine arrived it wasn't working properly so obviously no one put batteries in it to check the unit before they shipped it. The TURN SIGNALS never operated. I went ahead and installed it on my bike as I needed the safety of the flashers and headlamp but within five (5) weeks they ceased to function as well. File this under LEARNED MY LESSON. Piece of junk. Spend the $ to get something that will work for you.
4,Green Thoughts,Interesting tidbits of information not found elsewhere. Author carps constantly which gets in the way of enjoyable reading. Author doesn't know there is a US beyond the East Coast.
3,Great for capturing architecture,This lens is great for capturing architecture and all inclusive scenes but not good to use as an all around lens. Auto focus does not work with this lens. This is a great lens as a third but I don't suggest buying it as your first or second lens.
3,Steve Took's Horns - 'Blow It!!!' (Cherry Red),"Twelve tracks,of WHAT I assume are maybe rare and unreleased cuts from the one-time early T.Rex collaborator.Not sure if this collection of tunes would be considered so much as 'psychedelic' as it would be just straight ahead rock&roll. Tunes I dug the most were ""It's Over"", ""Woman I Need"" (two of the disc's three versions), ""Yeeooww"" and the cool instrumental ""C.I.A."". Was semi-amazed at this line-up: Steve Peregrine Took-guitar&vocals, Judge Trev Thoms(Inner City Unit)-guitar&vocals, David Mantell-vocals, Commander Jim Hawkwind-synthesizer, Ron Tree(is this right?)-bass&vocals and Dino Ferari-percussion. Maybe not a masterpiece, but decent. Eye-catching cover, no?"
3,Great multi purpose device with some problems,"I received this pen for Christmas because I was cramping up my hand writing with the stylus included in my Palm III. I didn't want to carry a pen, pencil, and the tiny stylus.It is a great pen with a few flaws. The rubber grip coating is not durable enough and mine has been gouged and stratched off in a few spaces. The pencil tip unscrews itself and falls off in the pen regularly and the pencil mechanism jams easily. Also the eraser is small and I have not found replacements yet. The pen and stylus point are top notch.Overall it is a usefull tool and much more comfortable than the basic stylus but it could use some more work."
3,writes best when it works!,"I just received this stylus yeterday, (july 11, 2001). The stylus was great. It was very easy and also very fun to use. Then the next day I woke up and found out it was also very easy to break. When I took of the cap I had the stylus end selected. For no reason I gave it a little twist on the end, thinking nothing would happen. I was wrong! The Stylus part lost a lot of its spring back and was almost useless because it would always jam. I thought to my self, ""well I am sure I can just brake into this puppy and fix it"", that was a bigger mistake. When I tried that I just made it even worse and the whole stylus trio was gone. The stylus was a great tool and worked out great unfortunately it wasn't idiot proof. I recommend this stylus to anyone who needs the trio action to help them, but be careful and don't play around with it!"
2,Piece of Poo,"The can was fun the first few times it was used, but, soon thereafter the thing stopped working. Very poorly made as evidenced by ""Made in China."" Do not purchase unless you simply have money to rip up and throw away!!!"
1,DOA,"This product shipped fast and arrived ahead of schedule, but unfortunantly was dead on arrival. When turned on, it emitted a very loud buzzing sound, and dilivered no shock when grabbed. The seller was curtious and prompt in a refund. So I rate the seller high, but the product low."
3,Super Reader,"This is the first book in Moorcock's Pyat quarter, something that took him quite a while to finish. Not that this is a shock to anybody familiar with this work.The protagonist in this series is a bit half and half, in JC terms. Half Jerry Cornelius, half John Constantine, and full of a lot of rubbish as a consequence, without being as useful or competent as either.He is living through some harrowing times in pre WWI Russia, and is just trying to slide on through. He has a fairly serious problem with s*x and dr*gs though, and does some not nice things as a result."
2,Disturbing ride,"The reader knows from the beginning that Col. Pyat a is disturbed and wounded character. I initially accepted this and watched him gradually lose his innocence as WW1 unfolds and darkness falls on Russia, but when he brutally seduces and attacks two young women while in a cocaine induced psychosis he became just another one of the many criminals littering the landscape. I lost all sympathy for him and closed the book. Perhaps Pyat is supposed to represent the descent into madness that occurred more generally in Europe at that time, but I'd rather examine that horror though the eyes of a morally strong character that I can continue to care about."
1,JUNK! CANNOT FIND PARTS!,Our Corrego faucet didn't last a year and you can't find parts! - and I'm a plumber! I would give it zero stars but that's not an option!
3,"Companies are starting to forget what ""relaxed fit"" really means.","I want to stress that these are not ""relaxed"" in any way. They aren't skinny jean tight, but they're just normal fitting, and that's before washing. Visually they look decent, and the material feels quality (since it's Dickies this does not suprise me), but it's just the fit that feels problematic.The other issue I'm finding, not just with these but others as well, is too much in the waist and pocket area and not enough in the crotch and leg area; meaning the belt line should not go up above my belly button, yet I'm forced to do that because of how much excess there is. It's like they constructed the pants with a large bottomed female in mind or something.Pockets are rather shallow. This is standard Dickies but given these are jeans I guess I expected them to flex a bit."
4,great value and shipping,We had only slight disappointment because they are 'vanity' sized a little large and the main reason why we buy my husband's jeans online is because it is hard to find 32x34 stocked in stores. They were not so big that he can't wear them but require a belt which is not the case when he gets the same size in other brands.
2,Poor description of product,"These jeans are 'relaxed fit' fat boy jeans not real jeans. The only way you would know this is by an interpretive reading of the manufacturer's description, not by plainly stating the fact in the Amazon product description that these are fat boy jeans, like they do on some of their other products. I haven't even opened the package yet, and I already disappointed. I will know better in the future to be more careful when buying a Dickies product."
5,"Very, very nice jeans!!!","My husband was thrilled to get these. The color was just right, the fit was perfect. He wants me to order him another pair. He's a big and tall guy so it is hard to find his size in the stores and at 6'4"" sometimes we will order jeans and have the length not be correct. In this case the length was just right!"
3,When Brown is Not Brown,"I like brown. Fall oak leaves, chocolate, wheat before the harvest... you know, BROWN. These jeans were supposed to be brown, but they are basically a dull blue. They are NOT brown. I'll wear them because I don't want the hassle of doing a return. But seriously, people, get the color chart corrected!"
3,large,"dickies usually run smal on me so order two sixes larger, has to take these in a couple inches around waste, must be the style or just inconsistancy, look great and even roll up bottom cuffs, get nice comments"
4,Great Album!!!,"Inspectah Deck sharpened his lyrical sword for this one. All WU TANG FANS and fans of hip hop will really appreciate this one. I can honestly say that its his best CD to date. Production is nice, lyrics complement very well."
4,Great Album,"this album is very underrated since most Wu fans don't appricate Inspeactah Deck as they should, but this album doesn't matct up to is debut Uncontrolled Substance but still any Wu head should go pick up this album"
2,Let's stop lying to ourselves,"Deck stole the show on countless Wu tracks. Everyone was hyped for him to drop a solo. It was decent, but not what everyone was hoping for. The 2nd time out, he didn't slip lyrically, but the beats slid. This time, the beats sound like they were selected completely at random from demo tapes sent in to Wu headquarters. Worst of all, Deck is sleepwalking through the songs.It's time to face it....some people are just ment to shine in a group and leave the solo career alone. Look at the people from Brand Nubian, ATCQ, the Lox and other groups that all did decent together but put out average at best material when left to thier own devices.Deck dominates Wu albums. Maybe he should be the centerpiece of the next one. Even at that, he would have the others around him to work off of. This album shows he needs it"
3,Patient for more,"Whenever an artist drops a mixtape with at least a few great tracks, it's a very good sign. Now'a days I only expect a few classic tracks on an album to concider it getting my moneys worth. When you find that same quality in a mixtape, you can feel good about whats to come. Ever since the Record Companies put a ban on the singles... to me mixtapes seems a must.The Wu Tang Clan has a lot in the works. With there typicaly delayed release dates and album hype, being a true Wu Head can keep you hungry. Mixtapes dropin' from the Wu is a good sign that the group is about to put some stuff down."
2,What is this?,"If you're a hard core WU-fan don't buy this album. Inspectah Deck seems to have made a CD out of reject tracks from the from his lack luster album ""The Movement"". He also decided to recycle bits and pieces of lyrics that he has already spit over the span of his career. Skip this album and pick up Masta Killah's new cd Brooklyn King."
3,A great singer's ill-advised last album,"Some of us who vastly admire Elisabeth Schwarzkopf react badly to this farewell recital that she was persuaded to make after her voice had declined. I believe the date was either 1972 or 1977 (my disc doesn't have the program insert). Schwarzkopf was the absolute mistress of Wolf lieder, and in the Morike selections heard here, one can't help but respond to her artistry, yet vocal security comes and goes, and all of these songs were done to greater effect on her many recordings for EMI. Georffrey Parsons provides excellent accompaniment, and Decca's sound is first-rate. If you don't know Schwarzkopf, this is a bad place to begin."
4,"Genereic AND specilised, at the same time","One of few books about security consulting. It is also a very general walk-through of some of the more practical aspects of starting a consulting business.Recommended, as it is written in a very straight-talking way, without any mumbo-jumbo or great theories, just pure experience."
3,Need to research more.,It takes the pain away if I take it 3 times a day but I cannot sleep when I do. I cut down to 2 times a day and I can sleep but have more pain in my knees during the day.
1,Not effective for gout,This stuff doesn't work. I had an attack after beer and salami for the World Series. It was relatively modest since I'm very careful limiting purine rich food in my diet. But it was still painful and disabling. There was no Miracle. Eating cheese sandwiches and vegetable stew for two weeks and drinking two quarts of water a day caused the crystals to dissolve. There was no difference from former attacks without the pills. For me it was a waste of money.
5,Sacred Knowledge,One of my teacher's on the path told me to read this book. It's wonderful and very inciteful into the Heart of Mongolian Shamanism. It's quite a journey and excellently written. Someday I'll get there!
3,Not Bad...,"The book covers modern Mongol shamanism to a reasonable degree, but leaving some areas not covered. At first I thought the book was simply deficient in spots, but I think perhaps it is Mongol shamanism that is deficient. What I would like to see is a book on how their shamanism was BEFORE the Russians and Chinese tore their country to pieces and forcibly converted so many of them. Perhaps such knowledge is lost to history."
3,Rita Hayworth DVD set in Trinidad,"I purchased this DVD more so to see the historical setting in old Trinidad. It was a great movie, and I recommend it to anyone, especially people from Trinidad who want to take a peek at Trinidad in the old days when the movie was shot."
3,More than I expected,"I have seen Ford and Hayworth in movies (seperately) since World War II. The story is quite good, as are the script and the direction. The suspense and plot twists are interesting, and Rita Hayworth was very good in a fairly difficult role. I expected only a steamy romance vehicle, having seen repeatedly publicity so indicating for Gilda and for this picture. I was very pleased at the picture,including theTrinidadian blacks being so favorably and well protrayed for the time, and such roles being very well acted. And there is some chemistry there ! Maybe 3 1/2 stars out of 5 (I don't give many 5s)."
1,More like a English to French dictionary on tape.,"If you are looking to speak and understand French, this is the wrong course. Simple words and phrases are spoken in english then repeated in French. You are to repeat after the french speaker. The problem is that you only hear each word/phrase once. The average person with no French background would have to listen to the tape 10-20 times just to retain some of the material. The first tape goes through the whole alphabet, a ton of numbers, complete conjugation of several verbs, and different greetings.A better choice for the beginner, would be a course where you will actaully LEARN to speak and respond to French sentences."
2,Very difficult and hard-to-follow approach,"I had no idea about French when I first bought this tape, and after I listened to the first tape I still had no idea about French! It is impossible to learn French from these tapes! I spent two days listening to Lesson 1 trying to grasp its content, but it was very difficult. New words are introduced without explaining their meanings, they talk very fast, basic concepts are ignored, and the exercises are useless! After spending almost a month trying to learn from the tapes I decided to enroll in French classes. After a month now I am the best student so far and I can initiate basic conversations. I guess this means that the problem doesn't lie within me, it's with those tapes. I did however benefit from learning a few new French words, but that is not worth the cost at all."
3,"WWII London, with spies and black outs","An English journalist just back from Dunkirk writes a story blasting a London-based peace-in-our-time organization, but the story is killed by a government agency. Are there Nazi sympathizers or just cautious bureaucrats in the agency? Is the peace group led by innocent dupes or by ruthless Nazi agents? The reporter intends to find out.The movie isn't A-list, but it's better than a programer. It's a craftsman-like piece of work. In feature roles are two first-rate British character actors, Roland Culver (The Pallisers, Dead of Night) and Miles Malleson (Kind Hearts and Coronets, The Man in the White Suit)The DVD transfer is surprisingly good considering the age of the movie and that it was never considered a classic"
5,incredible,"This is one of the best books I've read in many years. Not only is Ruark's style incredible, it's amazing how he managed to ruthlessly portray the changes in Kenya. Some may say he was a racist, Uhuru however portrays some Kenyans as the most intelligent inhabitants of the country at the time. Unfortunately, , they were stuck to their traditions and unable to cope with modern times. Like the British colonialists however, who were insensitive to the changes going on in the rest of the world, which was at the time so incredibly far away from their farms, their own world.A wonderful book."
4,tale set in 1962 Kenya poised on brink of self-rule,"Robert Ruark captures the political turmoil that swept though Kenya, the Congo and is still going on in Africa today. The story centers on a professional white hunter, and his friends and family. Some may object to his usage of various deragatory remarks toward Africans. Slow in beginning but picks up pace. I couldn't put down during last 100 pages"
2,Narrow disease perspective!,One will not find anything new in this book. If you are not a strong proponent of the disease concept then you will probably not like it.
3,"A good read, but not a keeper...(3 1/2 stars)","The daughter of a prosperous rancher, Rebecca Anderson is shocked and upset when she finds herself pregnant and abandoned by the man she loved.Jake Burnett is a good man that has had a hard life... he has never felt wanted. While working for Rebeccas father, Jake falls in love with her, but only from afar. He is surprised and pleased when Rebeccas father proposes that Jake and Rebecca marry so that her child might have a legal name.""Sweet Lullaby"" was an okay read. I really really liked Jake, but I wasnt too impressed with Rebecca. I though she was extremely selfish and didnt deserve Jake. I also thought that the books style felt oddly amateurish for Lorraine Heath. Many of the scenes where very short and choppy and didnt flow well together, but overall it was a quick, decent read. This is not a book that I would consider a keeper, but it was worth reading."
2,Ugh Rebecca,Jake was wonderful and at the same time I could not believe he put up with Rebecca bs for so long.This book could have been oldie but goodie if Rebecca learned to grow up and If Jake grew a pair
3,Lacking,"The hero was perfect and deservered someone better to love him. I would recommand reading A Convenient Wife by Carolyn Davidson, because it is so much better story than this one."
3,Enjoyed the book but the heroine is a *****,"I liked this book very much except for the character of Rebecca. What a selfish cow! Jake was sweet, kind, and gentle to the point that I could no longer have much respect for him. Ok, they both went into marriage knowing the score, but by the 5,000th ""Anything you want, honey"" and ""I love you too much to hold you"", I was groaning in disbelief. How stupid does a woman have to get---you show up at the hotel to run off with the guy you think is your True Love...and he's got a naked blonde in his bed! A woman with a brain in her head would slap him, say ""Drop Dead."" and return to her not-so-handsome but idiotically devoted husband. She was too stupid to get a happy ending, in my opinion. Sweet book, but a little too much masochism on the part of the Hero."
3,Okay,Not my favorite Heath. I stopped reading about half way. The story was just not interesting enough for me to continue.
4,Sweet Story,"A man who is a nobody, marries the bosses pregnant daughter. He is not attractive and the heroine initially thinks so too. Eventually, she comes to love him and becomes a better person."
3,Don't get it.,"I picked this one off the shelf (at the library, fortunately!) without knowing anything about the author or the previous books in the series. Reviews here make it seem like you can start in the middle of the series: that's not the case at all. I read the first fifty pages, and saw no particular reason to waste my time finishing it. The characters are pathetic cardboard caricatures (the Revolutionary With Excessive Vocabulary is a perfect example: been there, read that; and I've seen much better, might I add?). It might have been worth reading on if any of the characters had any more than their single, overemphasized quirk. As it is, I couldn't manage to care about any of them long enough to find out if they ever attain development.I'm only giving it three stars because I didn't read to the end, and it's always possible that it gets more interesting. Anything is possible...."
4,as advertised,"This style by Anco is made of metal, not plastic, so it does not wibble-wobble in the wind and it does not break if you happen to rough it up with a snow brush or an ice scraper. It will last about 6-10 months, certainly the length of every repair manual's replacement schedule."
1,"Don't bother, try anything else","The wipers are so stiff they skip and bounce across the glass. The result is an unbearable noise (like fingernails on a chalkboard) and streaks. I thought they might loosen up with some use, but am now convinced they're garbage.The 5-year old wipers I replaced worked better than these."
5,Our windows are cleaner,"Yes, we went too long between wiper blade changes. This blade does a great job of clearing off water, and we get a nice clear windshield. It does tend to squeak a bit for the first couple of swipes, then that goes away."
1,"Came with missing parts, vendor not helpful","I ordered a pair of wipers. One was fine. The other came with missing parts, which made it impossible to install. Contacted the seller, who asked me to contact the manufacturer to return and get a replacement. This is too much hassle for a $5 part. Most other decent vendors will simply send another non-defect one.Not satisfied with the service, and will not buy from this vendor any more."
5,Good Buy,"Wiper blade is high quality and well worth the price that Amazon charges. Instructions for attaching the blade is limited to meaningless diagrams, I guess that's easier than using several languages. Also, I remember when one could buy just the rubber blade and insert it in the old metal frame."
1,wipers came apart,I replaced all the wipers on my 2008 Chevy Equinox. The driver's side came apart at one of the flex connections after a months use. I pushed it back together but it has play. The wiper rubber/metal sides inside the blades are smaller than they should be.
4,Great Wiper,These wipers really do a good job. No smearing or streaking just wipes the water away. Its been raining alot herein southern california and these Anco's are helping me get around. Im using the 18inch and 20 inch for my 89 probe.
5,Excellent,"Great deal. Did not have to go to the store. Saved time, effort and money. What more can you ask?"
1,Very noisy and poor performance,"I bought these wiper blades after reading a Consumer Report review, thinking that it's not necessary to pay a lot to get good blades. Well, they are not expensive but not very good either. Even brand new, they leave stripes on the windshield. On top of that they make a lot of noise when the blade changes direction. Last week Hyundai sent me a coupon for free wiper blades with any paid service at the dealership. It was time for my 15000 miles service. So I went and they put brand new Hyundai blades on the car: what a difference... Now I now what a good wiper blade is like...The Anco blades are not worth the cheap price that they sell for."
3,You get what you pay for,"A friend of mine recommended to me that this brand was cheap and does it's job and indeed he was right. The wiper doesn't wipe smoothly enough so it makes this ""farting"" noise against your windshield compared to RainX and Bosch wiper blades. It is good for the price you pay for it though."
5,Good buy,"Easy to install, Four mins. Could not find a lower price anywhere. Recommend for any one who needs new wipers. Purchased 2 at this price."
2,CHEAP,I ordered this costume and it was really cheap. The quality was awful and was sent with a hole in it. It looked like cheap felt sewn together in a minute. I returned it and was charged restocking fee. I will never order from this company again (Costume Cuzzins)
1,Don't bother!,I have had nothing but problems with getting this magazine. Numerous emails to the publisher and clearly they have no idea what they are doing. Missed 6 issues straight. I wouldn't bother subscribing to this unless you enjoy getting a headache.
5,Perfect,"I purchased this whistle for my son, who lifeguards. This whistle was just what he needed to be heard. I would definately recommend to others."
1,bad product,"it`s a very bad product , so big to handle between your fingers , the sound is poor comparing to FOX whistle , i prefer a Mini Fox whislte at this product , don`t waste your money at something like this."
4,Excellent Heavy Duty Snap Ring Pliers for large jobs,Rec'd it quickly in great shape! I had to grind it down a bit to fit into an outboard lower unit. It did the job perfectly! Large snap rings are not longer a threat!
5,Looks and Feels Heavy Duty!!,"I have yet to use it ,but you can tell when something is going to get the job done. These are big enough for anything I might run across in the mining industry. I know for a fact I would have paid a lot more on a tool truck for these."
2,Not what I expected.,The photo is not true to the size of the gloss. It is probably half the size (maybe even a little less) compared to the bag. A little disappointing since it is quite expensive. I probably would have returned it if I had seen it before my sister opened it for Christmas.
1,Doesn't WORK at all.,This charger doesn't work at all. I tried several times and it charged the Zune only two times and it took forever to start to charge. Look likes that Zune doesn't recognize this charger or something like that.
3,Zune Charger,"It's inexpensive and it works, not too much more to say than that. Some of the plastic parts will come apart, but snap back together if you catch it in time and don't lose any small pieces."
2,Made my zune act erratically,"For some strange reason, this charger, when connected to my Zune HD, made the touchscreen act very erratically and made touch inputs jump all over the place whenever i placed a finger on the screen. I tried a drawing app to test it, and sure enough, lines looked like they were drawn by a person having a stroke. This was especially a problem when typing.Otherwise, it worked fine and charged well, but this should not be happening."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"This unit has worked in all the outlets I've tried it in so far. It has successfully charged my Zune both times I've used it while travelling. I received a product that looks different than the one in the picture, but there don't appear to be any compatibility issues."
4,"It works, but doesn't fit quite right","I bring my Zune to work with me, because we are allowed to wear headphones and listen to music while working. Because I don't have my own computer at work, and for security reasons, I cannot charge my Zune using the USB cable I use at home. Appalled at the high price for a wall charger ($20 or more!), I was excited to find this one for around $5. While it charges up just fine, the plug is awkward and doesn't seem to fit the Zune perfectly. I've had to struggle with it a couple times to get it to fit into the slot, or to pull it back out. I guess you get what you pay for. I am still happy either way, since all I really need is the ability to charge the battery, which it does."
5,Perfect!,I use this mold to make chocolate cameras for clients as a thank you. It is a great size. I give one to each client (client or client couple) or two for each client family. The mold is easy to use and clean!
3,disappointed,"In the fine print the book I received WAS described as ""Revised Edition"". However I thought I was ordering the original version. Sadly I paid more for a used copy than the original price from the publisher. My copy is in good condition as described but absolutely not worth what I paid. Be aware!!"
1,Cropped to fit modern screen,"The two later Columbo movie sets, 1991 through 2003, were cropped on the top and bottom so that the image will match the shape of a modern TV screen. (The two earlier sets, 1989 and 1990, were not cropped.) I really wish people would speak out against this reprehensible practice, which amounts to mutilating works of art."
4,"Ah, just one more thing","I really enjoy this whole this collection. Eventhough the stories aren't as tightly made and well crafted written stories they had on The Sunday Mystery Movie on NBC, they are entertaining. Gee, what do you expect, once a Columbofan always a Columbo fan. The last one that was unaired, ""Columbo loves the Nightlife"" was the poorest of the bunch though. It started out as a a badly made independent film (believe me, I have made a few of them). The plot stumbles along until Columbo comes in and it gets a little better and the ending is pure Columbo but it as though Peter Falk could of phone it in and have a cut out picture of him in every scene(except the last one) I can see whyABC didn't air it. As I said, Columbo is excellant the last one is not.Quigs"
5,Good movies !,Columbo. Burning cigar. There will be more questions. Peter Falk's last Coulmbo movie was a bit different - but absolutely no complaints - They are all very good. We will enjoy seeing them several times.
5,love the movie,We love these movies. They arrived on time and we love just watching these for relaxation. We have movie nights with friends and show these. Many people forgot about how good they are.
5,Prize posession...,"Columbo can only get five stars, what can i say.... I now have every single columbi movie and tv show"
5,Columbo Mystery Movie Collection 1994-2003,Peter Falk was very entertaining in this film series. Iwas throughly entertained while watching .It brought back pleasent memories of watching it on television when I was a child.
4,Showing its age?,"The last seven ""Columbo""movies in this set are a mixed bunch. Some of the plots are threadbare and gimmicky. ""Murder With Too Many Notes"" could have been titled Murder With Too Many Minutes. I'm a Billy Connely fan (I would listen to him read the phone book) but it is a weak entry. Patrick McGoohan is back (does he ever leave ""Columbo""?) in ""Ashes To Ashes"", which is very entertaining indeed. The ageless William Shatner is on hand to chew the scenery as well in ""Butterfly In Shades of Gray"". Peter Falk as always plays his role perfectly, but Father Time was closing in. Good entertainment if you're willing to forgive a series that may have been kept going a little too long."
5,WHAT A MAN,ANY THING WITH PETER FALK IS AMAZING. IT BRINGS BACK THE 70'S WHAT A UNIQUE CHARACTER HE PLAYED AND DID IT SO WELL. I MISS HIM AND HIS SIMPLE HUMOR...
2,Not like the others - very irritating,"Disks won't play in my parents' unit, which isn't even that old.Reduced image on our TV.Not happy at all, although I LOVE Columbo!"
2,Columbo,I am disappointed due to the fact that I received two of the same discs of a three dick set. I am not sure whom to contact to fix this.
3,Careful! These are elsewhere,"We diligently bought each season of Columbo as they came out on DVd over the years. When we saw this, we were thrilled that a collection hadn't been released. We should have read more (I know, our fault) but these have ALL BEEN RELEASED ON HIS OTHER DVD SETS!"
1,Disappointing,"These are not hot stories - I don't know how anything S/M can be called the ""best"" without being really sexy, but here it is. A couple of stories from name writers are good, not great, and the rest is completely forgettable. A big disappointment."
3,Nice personal account,"This is a simple, personal account of long term encounters with crows. Great for us Corvid lovers. It's not scientific nor great literature, but feels like a conversation with a friend who really knows crows. I like the simple narration."
3,Human interactions within our species compared to other species.,"How can we humans compare the motivations of other species with our own?Speculating on motivations of other species is not necesssairly correct.However, the story was interesting and I appreciate the writer's work."
4,Safer on the screen than the kind that ship with most PDA's,"Most PDA's, Visors included ship with a low-quality plastic stylus that almost always scratches the screen. I haven't seen a single scratch yet from using this one. Also it is weighted better, feeling more natural in the hand. It has a nail-type of top which makes it stick out of the top of the Visor a bit, which makes it easier to remove while using some of the more form-fitting cases. This style of top could, however, get in the way of larger Springboard modules, but I haven't seen an example of this yet. Its reset pin, accessed by unscrewing the top, is a blessing... no more searching for a paper clip to perform a reset after a crash. It is perfectly round though making it prone to rolling off of table tops."
3,Mixed review,"The book is well done in terms of displaying portraits and pictures of various tribal folks in authentic ceremonial costumes. There were some pictures of those in day to day clothing but the book could have had more. Nevertheless, the book does serve the purpose of recording the various tribes and their varying traditional clothing.The main complaint I have may be with the publisher/printer and not the photographer. I have acquired two of the hard cover versions over the web and both have missing pages (pages 137 - 160) and duplicate pages (pages 123 - 136). I would like to acquire one that has the full 240 pages in the correct sequence. Buyers need to be aware of this problem before purchasing this book over the web."
3,Grindhouse import with subtitles,"This is an ambitious early pink grindhouse film that was distributed in the late 1960s in the US. It's the story of a student protester gone mad who witnesses a woman about to jump off a cliff saves her by sexually assaulting her. What ensues is about a hour of ""rape,"" (by no means graphic by today's standards) an echoing soundtrack littered with screams and muffles. The ending is a bit unsatisfying in that she simply walks off ""liberated,"" however, you are left wondering about the perpetrator! If you seenSlave Widow (Grindhouse Sexploitation Collection)orThe Bite: Japanese Slave Girls, see this for a good comparison of black and white pink films. Subtitled, dubbed and with optional commentary."
5,It Changed Me,This moving spiritual journey was painful and uplifting. I felt that I was personally experiencing the emotional turmoil of the author. He articulates his feeings so well and the depth of these emotions was palpable. I feel I learned a great deal about the trauma of divorce and the monumental impact it has on those involved. It will forever change how I relate to those going through this experience.
1,Two thumbs Up,"The book, With or Without You-A Spiritual Journey Through Love and Divorce, by Cameron Conant, is one of the best books I have read on the subject of divorce. As a professional dealing with divorcing couples, I find that this book has a positive message for those going through the heartache of divorce. I have recommended this book to many people who have been able to relate to the emotions which Cameron so aptly expresses. The book ends on a note of hope for the future as the author shares what he has learned from this painful experience."
4,honest and raw,"I didn't know what to expect when i picked up this book.I didn't expect the rawness and honesty that come flowing out of the pages. The Author doesn't gloss over his failures.The journey through his experiences and the link with U2 song titles is just awesome!I couldn't get enough of this book, I've read a few books on marriage and divorce, but this one really caught my attention."
2,Not telling the whole story,"He's a good writer; I found the book hard to put down and finished it within 24 hours of picking it up and thinking, ""I wonder what this is about...""That said, I don't think he's telling the whole story. The way he tells it, I feel like the wife is absolutely crazy, going ballistic over nothing--but she seemed normal enough before they got married, so I find that hard to believe and conclude he must be hiding something.What the book really needs is the same story told from the ex-wife's perspective."
2,He should have admitted more of his faults,"I agree with the reviewer who said he glossed over his problem with sex addiction. Because from the way he presented it, it was a relatively normal attraction to pornography and his ex-wife's reaction seemed to be a little overboard. I didn't really feel like he was as forthcoming as he could have been about what exactly made his ex-wife flip out. If there was nothing more to the story, he should have stated it, but he leaves the extent of his problem up to the reader to figure out. If he stated his whole problem, then the book is fine, and the ex was just a freak, but I have a feeling there's a little more to the story. And it would have been helpful if he could have explained what he knew about her family and why it wasn't the perfect family that she had always thought it was. It was a decent read, but I'm sorry I spent the money on it."
1,Not buying again from them,"The book wasn't in the condition described, it was described as in a very good condition, it has water stains, dirt, it's bended, it a big scratch. Terrible"
4,Good deal,"The book is more than perfect, its content, the way its written. It was right on time with a big discount, but had a corner a little wrinkled."
4,Calphalon Nonstick,"Wonderful pan, but the handles get VERY warm since it is oven-proof - wish it was broiler proof."
2,"A good pan, but only lasted 2 years","This was a great pan and one that we used everyday. It was a little on the small side for a family of 4 but was great for for most tasks. Then just a few weeks ago, I noticed that the nonstick coating was bubbling. Another week went by and an entire patch started coming off. I am now giving up on buying anything with a nonstick coating and am now going with stainless steel instead. Just seems like a waste of metal to have to replace these nonstick pans every two years."
3,"Good pot, but needs to get a ""handle"" on things...","There are two factors influencing the way you should look at this pot: 1) the cooking surface and 2) the handles.The cooking surface is great. It is perfect for an omlette or a couple of chicken breasts and is very easy to clean. It heats up quickly and looks brand new after many uses (be sure not to use Brillo pads when cleaning this!)The handles, however, try my patience. They are small and make cooking clumsy. I never realized how much I relied on other pots' handles until I started using this one. They do get hot, as other reviewers have noted, which is not beneficial. The handles are a con in my book.If you do not cook often or in great volumes, this might just be the perfect pan for you. However, if you want something that is going to be versitile and manageable, save your money and invest in a non-stick Calphalon omlette pan with a handle and lid."
4,Great pan except for the size,"This is a great pan.cleaning is a breeze.Heats up uniformly and fast.Great from stove to oven.If it was slightly bigger,nothing could beat this every day pan."
3,"A decent all around pan, but the handles hurt its rating","As a general non stick wokish type pan.. it works fine. It is a heavy pan that heats up nicely, and has a nice non stick coating.The handles... are just plain awkward.. Because of the weight of the pan, you do need to use both handles to move and pour the contents out of it. Due to the handles getting hot, and heat going all the way up the sides of the pan, you need to be very careful indeed... but the angle of the handles make it very hard to pour from, and it is near impossible to hold it up by one handle and use a spatula to scrape out the rest...This is my workhorse pot.. I dont use it for my nice dinners, but for an 'everyday' pan.. it is ok."
4,Great pan - but too small,"I was really disappointed when I received this pan. It is the smallest ""10 inch"" pan I've ever seen, and not very practical. I would return it, but it instantly became the best quality pan I own,and I will try to find some use for it. Save your money and buy the 12 inch! Also, [...] is a slow shipper. But hey, the pan was 70% off, so who can complain!"
4,A little small but useful for small cooking tasks,"For my family of four this pan is a tad small for cooking for the whole bunch. I can see this pan being used for smaller cooking, such as for one or two, and I do use this pan for that purpose. I like to eat scrambled eggs for breakfast, or even an omelet, and this pan cooks both dishes well. Easy to clean and I love the shorter handles. A good buy, especially for smaller families."
3,What you pay for,Just exactly what you pay for. hard to quantify quality or any other subjective measure but seemed good in my estimation
3,A convoluted dictionary that needs pictures,"A good dictionary doesn't use the term being defined in the definition. This is not a good dictionary. Geology is a visual science. To be a good field reference, pictures would be so very helpful, but there are none. Instead, stratification will be defined as ""having strata."" This may be a decent memory jogger for someone with a degree in geology, but for the amateur rock-hound, it's a waste of money."
4,Go Blue!,The only thing that would improve this visor is a dark color on the underside of the bill for better sun shading.
5,A Must for all PokéFans,"If you're new with Pokémon or you've become totally obsessed with it, either way you should get this book. A nice layout, and a page for every Pokémon, and a handy pronounciation key. Yah, get it! =^.0.^= MEOWTH Daaats right!"
2,"Nice art, but not very useful.","The artwork is very nice here, but it doesn't actually provide any new information on the pokemon, or anything that will help you in the game. Pronunciation guide and trivia are nice, but aren't worth buying the book."
2,Not enough Information.,"This book doesn't have enough information and is incomplete. It is missing over 100 Pokemon-- That's a lot of Pokemon missing! Even the other revised ""Official Pokemon Handbook"" is missing 99 of the Pokemon -- not much of a difference! I recommend just going to a whole other series that has a COMPLETE list of all 251 pokemon. Also, this book has NO information on the gold and silver versions! I like Pokemon and have a Pokemon Silver and think there should be a new version of the book (if this series is going to do something), but that probably won't happen because the Pokemon craze has basically ended. I went to another book that had a list of all 251 Pokemon and now I have 245 of the 251 Pokemon in the Silver version for Gameboy Color. The book has nice pictures of the original Pokemon, but it's nothing with out the additional 100 Pokemon."
3,"Overall, a good book","The Official Pokemon Handbook is a must for anyone who has the Pokemon Gameboy game. It tells you almost anything you want to know about each and every Pokemon - evolution style and level, strengths and weaknesses, attacks, and MORE. Perhaps the only bad thing about this book was that, well, it was not 100% printed with diligence (i.e, Lickitung is said to attack 5 times in a row with Supersonic, and confuse with Wrap - it is the other way around). Still, it is a wonderful book, though it lacks information about Togepi, Togechikku (Togepi's flying-type evolution), Mew, Marril, and Buru. Hopefully there will be information for the 251 Pokemon in Pokemon Gold and Silver, and help on Breeding, Bug Catcher's Tournament, etc in those games."
4,"A very helpful book, but I have seen better descriptions.","I think this is a great book for people who like pokemon, but do not have much knowledge about all the pokemon.I have the game boy Pokemon Red game, and it heped me at the beginning, but as I went through the the it does not help me much"
3,Could be better.,I thought this book was ok. The pictures were pretty good and the bits of trivia were neat but it wouldn't have taken much to make it a lot better. the main thing it needed was an index that had the strenghs and weeknesses were.
5,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book tells you everything that you wanted to know about all 150 of pokemon. My favorite thing about the book is the illustrations and facts about all the pokemon. The book is off the t.v. show mostly, I recommend this book to every person in the world who likes pokemon!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
2,not happy with the product,I was very happy with the product that i purchased until my nephew opened it Christmas morning and he found boxes already checked in the section to check off the pokemon you have. This irritates me because this product was supposed to be new and it obviously wasnt since it was written in!
4,The pokemon handbook,I really liked this book it definately helped me to learn the names of the pokemon.The only bad thing about it is in the book it mentions Mew as the rarest pokemon in the world but it dosn't show you him.And it also gives you some hints on the game.
4,Pretty good!,"I had this book when i was a kid but it got thrown away. Ordering it was a nice way to revisit some good memories. The only downside is that some of the info is slightly off/ made up. For example on page 37 in Pikachu's description it says ""Pikachu do not like to be inside Poke Balls"". This is a generalized statement based off of the fact that Ash's pikachu doesn't like to be in his poke ball. This is also the case with the surfing pikachu ash and the gang meet during season 1 of the tv show. Slight discrepancies like this are common throughout the book. That is the only downside to this book, otherwise its very interesting and also worth the money."
3,"Good, but not as good as the Deluxe Edition","The Official Pokemon Handbook is very easy to use, and can be very helpful at times. Basically, it has all the information you need from Bulbasaur to Mewtwo. Mew and Togepi appear in the Deluxe (Collector's) Edition. On my opinion, I would go with the Deluxe Edition instead of this one. Pretty good. An overall 3 stars."
4,"Pretty, but....","I bought these in Denim. It is a rich, pretty shade of blue. The leather seems like good quality. They are also VERY comfortable... The heel is a perfect height: tall enough to look high, but low enough to walk with ease. I seriously have sneakers that are not as soft and padded as these shoes.BUT... they are VERY pointy and the pointed toe is VERY elongated. I like pointy shoes, but these are a bit too ""wicked witch"" for my taste. They look okay from the front or back, but the side view is comical. I wear between a 7 and 8. I ordered these in an 8 (the 7.5 would have been fine), but they make my feet look HUGE and long like I have elf shoes on. Perhaps the toe would not look so ""long"" in a smaller size, but I'm not sure. I think its just the way they are made.I am sending them back, because I would feel silly wearing them, but I still gave them 4 stars for comfort!"
3,You get what you pay for,"The fingers don't move very well, but it works fine for a night of wear... I had to return the first pair because there was spilled paint all over the glove but Prime really makes these situations a breeze and I had the new pair in no time."
2,Not a Deluxe,This should not be advertised as the DELUXE GLOVE. The one I received is plastic and looks cheap. I bought the SAME ONE at a local costume store a while back and thought this one might be better. The glove shown in the picture appears to be suede with metal. WHAT I RECEIVED IS NOT THE SAME ITEM PICTURED.
2,not what was expected,"The item look nothing like the item received, will not shop with this company again."
5,A Terrific Laptop Case,This is a good looking and well made product. There is a lot of room for all sorts of computer extras. I'm ordering a second one when done writing this. If you need more protection for your laptop then check out a Haliburton case but for the most of us this is the real deal
1,acesonic am-828,Amplifier returned for 2 reasons: a bad constant speaker hum and the interface was advertised as a 2 way for recording. The interface only worked in and did not work out for recording.A refund was received for the full amount. However I paid shipping both ways at a cost of $70. The amplifier did have great power and sound.
3,"Shreds, but hard to clean","Soft cheese ends up getting sucked in between the blade and the cover toward the end, but for the most part shredding is quick and simple. Washing the blade takes more time than shredding the cheese, assuming you actually want to get every bit of junk out of all the unnecessary nooks and crannies. That's a bummer. Will continue to use and look for better ways to wash."
3,Cute but fragile,"My daughter (aged 6) loved this unicorn. She loved it so much that she was twirling around with it. While it is really cute and soft, it is a toy that should be kept on a shelf. Its seams have broken off in 2 places on the first day. I have patched it up but now my daughter is not comfortable with holding it for fear that it will fall apart."
2,Tiny,It was pretty but so much smaller than I expected. I guess I didn't read the measurements close enough. I think $10 would have been a more resonable price.
1,unhappy,"you did not send the one i ordered. i ordered capricorn the unicorn and you sent Claire and the unicorn, which was about $15.00 less. i had to go ahead and give it to the little girl for christmas because there was no time to get it back to you.... this is the first bad experience that i have had with amazon....but i think you have broke me from ordering gifts online...so i will take this time to tell you goodby...........David Price"
5,AMAZING,"Soft. Durable, beautiful colors. Nice size. Cuddly. Excellent value for the high quality of this toy. 6 year old loved it and I was proud to give it."
3,"Pretty unicorn, but not well made","This is a lovely little unicorn and I hope my daughter (3yo) will enjoy it. I am concerned about the quality- the seams running up the neck of the toy are already strained and pulling. I can't imagine it will last very long in the hands of an active preschooler, but I am sure she will enjoy it while it lasts."
1,"How can this brutality be considered ""related"" to dog rescue?","While ordering ""The Lost Dogs: Michael Vick's Dogs and Their Tale of Rescue and Redemption"" this horrible item is displayed as ""related"" to the book mentioned above. Only a dumb computer can assume a relation between these topics. While ""The Lost Dogs"" shows how to rescue poor deranged, misused dogs, confiscated from a criminal named Michael Vick, the latter item tries to glorify dogs with baring their teeth, snarling, being misused as weapons or ""sport objects"".I am so disappointed to find this kind of ware at Amazon.""Ghetto Dawg"" is exactly, what nobody really needs and wants. Except some criminal owners who should be banned from owning any animal.Sorry, I cannot rate it zero stars - what would be the correct rating.Sorry for my bad English, I am from Germany. I have two rescued dogs at my home (Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier)."
2,Terrible,"The producers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. Not only are they giving pit bulls a bad name, but they are portraying black people just as racist people think they really are. This movie is dispicable and should not even have been made. This is just another reason why black movies suck."
5,A to Z on how to heal the sick.,From the first to the last chapter this book is filled with good practical and biblical insight into the proper way to minister healing to the sick. I recommend this book to anyone who is searching for a fresh way to minister life to the hurting. Thanks.
2,"Good Movie, Terrible Transfer","I had been anticipating the release of this movie on DVD for a long time, but what a disappointment it turned out to be. The picture is about the same as my old Star VHS tape, but the sound is a disaster. The Francis Lai score sounds like an old tape recorder in its death throes. This appears to be a bootleg item. Judging from the reviews here, Amazon should pull this item and return all copies to the distributor -- if they can be found. Save your money until a better release comes out."
2,"Horrible DVD, Good Movie","This is one of the worst copies of a movie on DVD I have ever seen. It looks like it was copied from a video tape. The sound is even worse, in a lot of places it sounds like it was taped on a tape recorder with weak batteries, the sound problems are almost entirely during the music and background voices. The main characters can be clearly understood. I am a big Charles Bronson fan and hadn't seen this movie and was glad to finally be able to get it on DVD. The movie is very good, but the DVD transfer is pretty bad."
1,Horrible Reproduction,The reproduction quality of this DVD is worse than the VHS copy I own which is almost 20 years old. Save your money and wait for a better copy.
5,BRONSON AT HIS BRUTAL BEST!,"This is one of Bronson's best films,you haven't seen it you should definitely check it out. Its definitely one of his more unusual roles and you get to see his more comedic side at times. The film is heavy on atmosphere and it might take you a couple of viewings before you really ""get it"".The picture quality looks just like my vhs copy of the movie. However, don't let that deter you from getting this dvd if you haven't seen the film before. For a vhs to dvd bootleg it doesn't look that bad, believe me I've seen much worse (and I'm sure you have too if you buy cheap ass bootleg quality dvds.)I'm not holding my breath for a nice region one dvd release of Rider On The Rain (maybe some dvd company will prove me wrong but I doubt it). The dvd is cheap enough that its worth it, even though its full frame and vhs quality. If you just want to see the film go ahead and get this dvd. Don't expect a stunning transfer, just a stunning film."
2,Don't waste your money,"I was really disappointed in this movie. The message was positive and reinforced what I already know, however there was nothing new or profound that you won't get from every other source on this topic. Very poor production and soundtrack. Definitely not worth $15."
5,A must have,"It's getting me through my ""no dental coverage"" period. Easy to handle. Rubber grips are great. And love the no fog mirror."
1,didn't work for me,I ended up removing a filling and had to go to the dentist to get it refilled. He scolded me for buying this product which he was completely right about. GO TO THE DENTIST or you'll end up there with a worse problem then you started with using these tools-- they are sharp and you could puncture your gums if you aren't really careful.
1,garbage,"This descaler comes dull. The metal is insanely soft. If you sharpen it (assuming you have the necessary tools), it will be dull halfway through your cleaning. The mirror handle is made of very bendable plastic. It is garbage too. Buy a different product."
5,Perfectly acceptable,There is nothing unsatisfactory about this product. They clean both the residue under your toilet and the plaque off your teeth with equal effectiveness.
1,Duped,I feel mislead as I have now received my order. Upon review I received exactly what it said. However the picture shows two packages and said 2 picks with mirror. My mind automatically thought two packages. I had found the same product for a bit less but with two I could share. So I paid more for this one. I feel the wording and picture sneaky and misleading. They will get no more of MY money.
4,Plaque less,Was very helpful in removing plaque. I have saved $70 for a dental cleaning in between my regular bi yearly check ups.
5,Works well.,I brush and floss daily and I'm amazed at how fast plaque and tartar can build up. I've been using scalers for over 20 years. I generally use the scaler every two weeks or so and it is very effective in between my regular dentist visits. I'm 48 and my dentist always comments how good my teeth look. It's a good addition to your regular cleaning routine.
4,Does the Job,"This is a really good kit, you can get most of the same stuff that you would get at a cleaning done with this, my only suggestions is to get a mirror with a light, big diff when you're looking."
1,Could Be Hazardous To Your Teeth,"I got these thinking it would be a good way to get at my pesky molars. I've always had good teeth and great hygiene. That is, until I got these picks. I know I should have paid better attention to what was happening, but I've used these for over several months. I now have cavities for the first time in my life at age 30 because these damn things were slowly building crevasses in my back teeth. Yes, I'll admit the scrap and flat side works well with these tools, but I felt like punching the first dentist I saw the day I rolled my tongue under my back molars and founds a sharp pit of worn enamel in several teeth. What was an attempt at continued dental excellence and maybe home dentistry for just a few dollars turns out to cost hundreds of dollars at fixing the problem. Go ahead and get these. The handles are comfortable and quality, however the metal will bore holes in your teeth if you're not careful."
4,Awesome TV - especially for the value,"I highly recommend this TV! 4:3 is the way to go, most people watch 80% tv is 4:3 mode (do you watch DVD's more than you watch regular TV?) 16:9 mode on most TV's either stretch the image or leave annoying grey bars on the side. Mitsubishi recommends you play the tv in stretch mode all the time so you don't burn the screen which is something you don't have to worry about on this tv. Also, the fetch mode on this TV makes the High-definition even crisper. The simmulated surround-sound on this on this unit is wonderful. There are two problems with this TV, (which aren't real problems), there is only one set of component video in, although if you buy the right HDTV directv unit it goes into the svga port instead. Secondly, the picture in picture is one set size, the consolation prize is that you can put it anywhere on the screen."
1,BEWARE,"I did my due diligence. Consumer reports, and other places and decided to by the D52130 and it was a fantastic TV for 1 year and 4 months. Then the power just went off and wouldn't come back on( Best Surge protector money could buy on it to). Repair=$... (Power Supply is integrated into main digital board)After getting very ( upset ), I researched on the web and found the same exact story from other consumers on this exact model and other RCA TV's. The real problem comes down to poor soldering on RCA products. Overtime weird problems like this creep up because they changed their methods a while back.So dont' windup paying 2 grand for 16 months. Oh and from what I hear the fixes the extended warranties offered eventually just didn't help from what I read on the web.Product was great during its short life. What happened to TV's outliving your pets?BUYER BEWARE:"
2,RCA will not stand behind this product,This tv does have a great picture but there are a couple of problems. Number one every time there is a surge coming in the house I have to unplug the unit for about three hours even though I have it plugged into a quality surge protector. Second and most important after about six months the surround mode went out which also to a lesser extent affected the regular stereo sound. RCA gave me the number to a service center and they came and took the tv for three weeks and during that time RCA said it couldnt do anything to speed up the process. Well now three months later the same problem has popped up yet i'm supposed to go through the same BS I went through before. I will never purchase another RCA product EVER!
2,Could be Better,"This case is reasonably priced but is kind of disfunctional. The palm pilot slides into a holder that has cut-outs for your screen and your buttons. However, it is difficult to get to your stylus and the holder covers parts of the screen."
5,Wonderful (and fun) teaching tool!,"Great photographs help children connect daily activities with the time of day. The hands on the clock can be moved as the activities of the day progress!What better way could there be for young readers to learn to read a clock and enrich their reading vocabulary at the same time? Currently, this book can only be found on Amazon through other dealers. I only wish it was available through Amazon again -- it is quite good!"
3,Not a great fit...,"Well, I'll keep this short, but I actually thought this looked like a nice stylus, and, while it is, there is one problem. The stylus works very well with the Visor, and it's very sturdy. But, it sticks out of the top of the Visor. To me, that's very annoying. So, since the included stylus is fine and includes the reset pin and screwdriver, I don't think this is the best alternative. Needless to say, I returned mine, but if you don't mind it sticking out a bit, you may enjoy it."
4,Good for the money,"The heft and feel of this ""nail"" makes it easy to manipulate, and the fact that it sticks out of the top of the Visor is something that I actually like, makes it very easy to grab.The chrome finish does make the thing quite slippery in the hand, and my finish was chipped and pitted out of the box. (Didn't affect writing with it of course)The orange tip did aid my writing in the ""near dark"", and felt a degree softer than the Handspring stylus tip.I have used the PDA Panache stylus for the Palm Vx and III, and find this to be a solid addition to their line."
5,The best stylus I own...,"Great stylus: feels more like a pen, absolutely love it! My Visor case has a stylus slot where I keep it for quick access, so I'm less concerned about its size. If you want a stylus that is comfortable, has a little weight to it and that looks great, get this one!"
4,"Very nice stylus, though a bit pricey","This stylus not only feels good in hand but works well (""writes"" better than the stock Visor stylus) also. I have no problem with this stylus sticking out of the Visor because I'm using the Visor with a leather case, so it still looks good with the Visor in the case. However, the only downside is the price is a bit high for a stylus."
1,It's doesn't cost its price.,"Unfortunatelly it scratch the screen, doesn't feet a visor and some kind of slippery. And why I should use my nails to get it from the visor ???"
1,I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY DVD MOVIE,"I am very worry up for my purchase, because almost 2 months ago I have purchased the DVD movie Black to you and it doesn't came, please send me the DVD movie ""Black"" or get my money back."
1,"Very, very dissappointed","I also bought this product based upon the first review, and the fact that this spear was selling for more than comparable items (which I thought corroborated the higher quality). What I recieved was a very cheap and damaged plastic spear. This was for a birthday present, and it was a huge dissappointment. I am asking the seller for a full refund."
4,Nice Prop for Halloween,Worked great for Halloween Spartan costume. I also bought a shield and my daughter fell in love with the sword for the outfit. We entertained many a party guest as she attacked me with the sword or the spear and I defended other kids with the shield. Lots of fun.
3,Great costume part but only for looks.,"Part of my 300 costume, it looks great, but a little short. It bent in shipping and never regained form. Looks cool but purely for looks. Do not play with it and it will work."
1,MY CONSOLE IS MISSING!,"My shipment arrived today. I opened it at once and my console is missing. It's got everything, games and accessories, but the console is not here? WHAT THE F*CK?!!?!???!!?!!?!?!"
4,Please allow me to brag.,"This concert was my first ever(Lived in Denmark then).I somehow managed to drag my mom along or I would not have seen or heard this.It was truly a brilliant show and our ears were ringing for a week after.This recording is a bootleg of sorts and therefore not up to the same standard of Made In Japan,which must be one of the top 5 metal live recordings ever.This is a recording of the first or second time they played Machine Head live .The trax are somewhat different than they would be in Japan,but the quality of this recording sounds like a boot,but performance is top notch.So if you know Made in Japan note for note like I do,I welcome the different versions."
5,A broad spectrum anime,"The title was what got my attention, with an artistic air to it that seemed like it would have a meaningful plot. I then read the reviews and learned that it was full of fanservice, something that tends to ruin a lot of Anime.All in all, the fanservice was obnoxious at points, but the plot was maintained in the background at an appreciable level. It wasn't so deep as to boggle any minds, but it was an enjoyable story with enough depth to keep me interested, but was layered so that if that's not your interest, you still may find something to like about this one.For a finale, I was pleased with how they completed the character development and explored the main character's hearts and motivations in a very captivating manner."
1,Liers,Straightening gel? it made my curly and frizzy hair more curly and frizzy. May be my hair is so curly and strong to hold this gel instead of this gel holding my hair. I am not satisfied at all.
3,I wanted better,"I love the idea of a small twon full of magic. But Mysteria just didn't work for me. I understand that with a short story you really don't have time to slowly build a relationship between the characters. The heroes of the story were ok, and I liked MJD werewolf. I would have enjoyed reading more about him and the family he grew up with. But for the most part the heroines were really forgetable. A couple of them were even irritating. The stories were all so ho-hum. I suspect that this might become a series of short stories because the minor characters all seem to have intresting backgrounds. If they come out with a mysteria 2 I'll give it another shot.."
1,upsetting,"I bought the book not realizing that I already read all four short stories in a previous anthology. I wished the book informed me of this, oh, I don't know, somewhere on the cover, before I threw my money away."
2,Intriguing but Vague,"The beginning of the book is very good with a perspective on scientific thinking.The idea of blending is then clearly explained with a multitude of examples. But it is overdone with too many examples and too many question and answer discussions. One has almost the impression that the text is in fact intended as a study supplement.But in the end one asks, isn't this all just another word for association and so what any way. It is vague in a way not to be useful.Nevertheless the text is referenced by many cognitive linguists and is a source of inspiration apparently."
3,Great book with a somewhat annoying issue on Kindle edition,"I thought twice before taking two stars from this book because its content is so good. But I am evaluating the whole product so I had to consider the fact that this book has colored pictures which Kindle is unable to display and that are fundamental for the points being presented.I know I can go to Kindle PC and see the pictures there with all the colors etc. but one must agree that it is a pain in the butt to switch to the computer every time I needed to see a picture.So, if I had purchased the printed book, I would give it 5 stars, but the Kindle version has flaws.About the book's content, it carries very useful information if you look for something beyond a pure recipe book."
1,Trite collection of aphorisms,"First and foremost, please note this is a Christian book that contains frequent references to God and various religious principles. If you are not religious, or don't believe in using religious teachings about ""success"", then don't even bother with this book. The editing of this book is so poor it it resembles more a vanity publishing book (which is probably what it is, or started out as anyway). If nothing else, it appears to be nothing more than a random collection of trite aphorisms, general observation, and various Christian principles that can be found in no shortage of other books like Thing and Grow Rich, which at least has the benefit of being well-written and edited. Stay away from this one, regardless of the price."
2,"Repetitive & Yes, Very Poorly Edited",The other reviews about the poor editing is correct to the point that the poor editing coupled with the repetitive content makes me think I am going to stop reading it and move on.
4,"Part autobiography, part life lessons","This was a book I've been wanting to read for a long time and finally did. Mr. Stone was a legend and a billionaire who lived to be a hundred, so why not read what he had to say? While I enjoyed it and learned from it, one will quickly tell that it was written a half century ago. Worth your time, but don't expect a lot."
4,A 50 Year Old Book that Still Resonates,"A 50 year old book that still resonates. It is a typical ""self-help"" style book that gets you thinking about improving your approach, your effectiveness, your values and your life. W. Clement Stone views the key to success in three concepts - Inspiration to Action, Know-how and Activity Knowledge. These are attained through continuous education, self-improvement, ;earning from others, acquiring both financial and holistic wealth, to embrace our patriotic duty, to align our values and to find the true riches of life. The style is definitely 50 years old, and some of the approach is pretty dated - especially when J Edgar Hoover and Herbert Hoover are noted as great American heroes. Nevertheless, it is a good read if you are into these types of books."
3,Very good career advice.,"Very good career advice book. Forces the reader to critically analyze good and bad work habits.Somewhat annoying is the author's repetition and advice to ""Reread this chapter and absorb it's concepts.""The go to church and be a good christian gets hokey; I reach the point where I wish they'd admit to greed and avarice!"
2,Great book - terrible edition,"This is a great book, but this edition is poor. Poorly constructed, typos, missing bits, layout lapses. Try a different edition"
2,Good book. Abysmal editing.,"This 2010 edition is utterly horrible. Its a good book--3 or 4 stars for content. Zero stars for the hundreds of typos and other distracting errors this edition has. It looks like they scanned a previous edition with optical character reading but they failed to fix errors in the scan such as words appearing as ""modem"" when the particular word should read ""modern,"" further the layout is reminiscent of formatting errors that occur when you copy and paste to a word document from another source that just doesn't mesh well whatsoever into word formatting (the spacing between lines fluctuates throughout and lines trail-off early before reaching the margins). ""BNpublishing"" should be embarrassed of themselves. Fat chance I will ever buy another book from this publisher, lest it comes with a guarantee that they have since hired an editing staff."
5,This book really delivers,"[...]W. Clement Stone was the guy who tasked Napoleon Hill with a 20-year study of wealthy people and their habits that resulted in ""Think and Grow Rich.""The Success System that Never Fails is a straight-forward book that describes how to create a proven system to succeed in just about anything.While Mr. Stone had a background in insurance, his system could just as easily apply to any sport or other activity."
5,Classic!,"The stories told are of archaic companies and circumstances, but the principles hold true today! This book should be read over and over, for a lifetime."
3,Good but not necessarily worth buying,"Not bad, but definitely not great. It's got the standard list of things to be if you want to be successful. I didn't find it really useful."
1,belief in god required,"This booklet is really a repeat of all the other books with the same thème. However, you will need to believe that god will do some of the work. But as my dear old mum used to say 'god helps those who help themselves'"
5,Amazingly powerful book,"This book is so powerful. It is simple, and easy to understand and apply to your own life. W. Clement Stone has done it again and answered the age old question to life: ""Why do some people work so hard all their lives and get nowhere while others quickly and easily find success?"" If you want to know this, then get this book!!The Success System That Never Fails"
3,it's ok,"I made the mistake of expecting this to have more to it. first off I had been told it was more grafic that it actualy turned out to be. I also had been led to believe that more of it had to do with the pre-story behind the show it was based off of.Despite this it is still a good story. The 1st disc is kind of depresing, but very well riten and with great animation. I was less impresed with the other discs, but they where still ok."
3,I was so excited,"After hearing so many people talk about Samurai X I decided to purchase the Complete set.First let me say that the first disc ""Trust & Betrayal"" is amazing. After watching the first disc, I was completely blow away and could not wait to put in the second disc. Well, when I did put in the second disc I was so let down. The second disc has different artists and it is apparent within the first few scenes. I didn't expect them to keep up the romance angle that was started and ended in the first disc, but overall this disc and the rest of the set could not compete (except for the Director's Cut of Trust & Betrayal).I loved loved loved the first disc, just save some money and try to get the first disc because it sets the bar so high that you will be completely disappointed with the rest of the set."
2,"Syrup is great, but PASS on the lozenges!!!","I've used the syrup version of this product in the past, and had no issues with it. -Tastes fine, easy to swallow, and so on. However, the lozenge version of this product is HORRIBLE! It's like sucking on a gritty pill, not like a smooth cough drop. The actual taste is on the bitter side, and takes forever to dissolve. Additionally, you'll be left with a reddish-purple stained tongue.Overall, I absolutely would NOT recommend the lozenges. They're not convenient and have too harsh of a taste for the amount of time it takes for them to dissolve. Buy the syrup version instead; it's a quick drink, and you're done!"
2,American Wholesale. Would have to rethink ordering from them again.,Seller may be o.k. but delivery VERY slow. Also got a seemingly flippant reply to one of my questions.
2,Made me cough,I enjoyed the other four ounce product better without zinc and extra stuff cuz this one makes my throat itch
2,Taste Terrible!,"I hate to pan any of the Nature's Way Sambucus because I LOVE the liquid. But these things taste TERRIBLE!! Unfortunately I purchased two boxes. Oh well. I'll still use them if I'm away from home and feel a cold coming on, but will always use the liquid at home and will never purchase these again. Ugh. My husband didn't think they tasted all that bad, but he has no taste. LOL - pun intended."
3,our pediatrician recommended this,not really sure if it works or not. but it does seem to help alleviate the severity of the symptoms. it has zinc in it which is probably the primary reason it has any effect.sometimes depending on how early we catch it we will take this and cold-eeze together. that can sometimes head off a cold.
1,Didn't Work!,"I tried this when the usual elderberry that I use, Nature's Answer Immune, was unavailable. While it tastes good, it did nothing for my cold. Next time I will just have to stock more Nature's Answer Immune"
2,Not For Me,When I took this product it made me feel worse. I suspect it is the Zink in it.I knew this was not just Sambucus but thought the combination of ingrediants might be better.I found out this was not for me. Will not buy again.
5,"Great Product, Fast Delivery!",The product is really good for preventing cold. And it arrived within a week.
5,My Son doesn't come home as sick anymore,"Like any new parent who is annoyed with their child's pediatrician constantly saying, ""you have to wait out the cold. I can't give anything."", I looked into homeopathic medicine. I don't care what doctors think because if they're not into alternative medicine when nothing else can be given, then what good are they for their patients.I got this product and gave it a shot with my baby/toddler. He'll be 2 in August and hasn't gotten sick since the beginning of May. He was sick due to daycare every other week. Once he got better, he got sick again. The problem has been resolved between Sambucus and once a day gummy bears with the Zinc and Echinacea. Since he'll be 2, I cut them in 3's and wait for him to swallow. I call them candy and he looks forward to having them every morning. He likes the tast of Sambucus and calls it yummy juice. It works wonders."
2,Had high hopes,"My kids just cannot kick this awful cough. They have both been to the dr. at least three times. Tastes good, however did not help with shortening the cold/cough and the kids got sick(er) again while taking it. This was highly recommended by some of my crunchy (natural) mommy friends and they swear by it. It may work for you. (g's Wifey)"
4,great 4 cold sores,i take this for cold sores and it helps. you have to start high dosing this when you first see the first sign of an outbreak of cold sores. then you can stop them dead in their tracks. GREAT!!
5,Perfect for Coughs,This product is great for the occasional cough I get.It calms the 'tickle' that sometimes keeps me awake.I also use some before trips to help boost my immune system.
1,Easily Breakable,Love this necklace SO much!Just wish it wasn't made with cheap product! It broke within a few week and I can't fix it because the round part where it hooks to the chain is the part that broke.
4,more info needed,"At $28 this may be the 3 CD box on DGG. I'd check with the supplier. Maazel's 3rd is ok, but not the best. If this IS the 3 cd box of ALL the symphonies, then see my review under his DGG recording of the 2nd symhony. You DEFINITELY want that performance! The DGG box has the cat. number: 419-314-2 and I believe DGG recently released another incarnation of this set as part of its ""trio"" series. For the same price as here, I'd get the whole box set."
3,Cheap Handy Tool,"Cheap socket set (25 Piece 3/8-inch Drive) that includes inch/metric sockets, extensions, and wrench set under $30. Handy for home and small-scale projects. However, included wrench set seems made of cheap material, not chrome polished, and there is no quick-release button on the 3/8-inch socket driver."
5,"Joseph Campbell, Pathways to Bliss","If you appreciate Joseph Campbell, you will be glad to have a copy of some of his posthumous writings that might not ever have seen the light of day."
4,Cultural Mythology,This is a very hard book to read however it was very interesting. I've known for years that many ancient stories and biblical stories all go to one beginning point. Campbell takes you to the point of first contact. Most religion dogma believers could not handle the truth as it is not profitable (pardon the word reference). All Campbell books seem to do this and should be read as a college level historical reference guide in Cultural Anthropology.
5,Fantastic Campbell,"This book is wonderful for everyone! Whether you are a long-time fan of Joseph Campbell or new to his teachings, it is great.I am a long-time fan and it is nice to see his philosophy presented so clearly and conscisely in one easy-to-read volume.Buy and read it today!"
4,New Horizons: Do I Dare?,"""Over and over again,"" writes Joseph Campbell, ""you are called to the realm of adventure, you are called to new horizons."" (133) And the questions remains, ""Do I dare?"" I you do, read this spiritual and clever book. If you don't the journey that awaits you is even more necessary and all the more exhilirating. I recommend Joseph Campbell in any form and colour, in any book."
4,Shiitake Growers Handbook,This is a very good starter book. It is an easy read - have already read it twice - and I find that it is good to get the basic principles. It does go into a few practical ideas for production.
5,very good,"needed it for a class, school charged $60 for it, but here i got it for under $5, and when i recieved it it looked brand new"
2,What about ADD,"Did I miss something? The book had some techniques for the side effects of ADD but had nothing for the CORE problem of ADD - Attention Deficit, i.e. concentration versus distraction. I was very dissapointed in the book. If someone could point out in the book where concentration is addressed I would be most grateful!"
1,dont waste your money,"This is a book that is designed to make you feel that the ADD brain is perfectly normal and, in fact, just out-dated by modern society. As if in times past the ADD brain actually conferred an advantage to its owner. So those of us with ADD, or with children who have ADD, should really just rewire our thinking about ADD to fix the problems we encounter with this disorder.Never mind that ADD causes problems for the child in integrating him or herself into this modern society. Never mind that the world will not stop to accommodate those of us who are ""different"". Never mind that without some real help the ADD child is at terrible risk of not successding in today's world.Dont waste your money on this feel good nonsense. Buy the ""Healing ADD"" book by Amen instead. That one is rooted in science and is actually helpful."
2,not very useful or practical at all...,"the book promises ""practical exercises"" that can ""be readily picked up"", yet there are hardly any. those that are there are described in such a vague manner that the ADD reader will just lose interest and not actually get the point.apart from one or two bits I consider this book largely a waste of my precious time"
5,The 18th century pure logic and basis for the pure logic of today,"Not compliant in the Bible logic with pure logic, but is compliant in what is to definitions of pure logic!The ""Book Pure Logic"", was written by me, before this book, which I found later !George F. Thomson Broadhead.A very important historic book by William Thomson !"
4,GURPS Magic - A much needed gaming resource,"Great book - not only is it easy to use (complete spell index with costs, times, and effects), but it really expands on the original Basic Set spells! All the elements are available, as well as Making & Breaking college, Movement college, and information on powerstones. This book is the perfect device (sometimes in conjuction with The Grimoire) to round out any Mage, Wizard, or dabbler in the mystical arts. A worthy investment for any GURPS player."
3,Other Books,"GURPS Magic is one of the many competent supplements for Steve Jackson's Generic Universal Role Playing system.Or, handy when you want to be on the receiving end of the Game Master interdimensionally hi-jacking you from the present day setting into a magic using environment. Handy for him, anyway!"
2,way too sweet,This product gives me heartburn when I take it. It is too sweet and gewy. I don't understand why everything gets so oversweetend now a days.
3,"Serves its purpose, not real tasty","This is a quality product that doesn't taste very good, which is pretty much what I expected. Mixes decently and serves it's intended purpose."
4,A nice overview of Sun and his struggles for China.,"Spencer wrote this book for young adults, but I thought it a good read for those uneducated in China's history. Sun Yat-sen was certainly a dreamer and an idealist, but he provided his countrymen with an inspiration for a different China, not the semi-feudal Manchu Empire. In large result, Sun was responsible for the Revolution that overthrew the Manchus. He also was an inspiration for the latter Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists. Both Chinas now pay reverence to his legacy.This is a quick and easy read for those interested in China. This book is a good read for both the young adult and the adult."
3,"Colorful and sweet, but...","This is a lovely book. Large and coloful, with tabs to pull to move pigeons, change hats, help Moo Moo eat ice cream, and more.I do, however, have one reservation. The book is tearable. And I do mean TEARable. In our first reading my 1 year old easily removed one of Moo Moo's rollerblades, and Moo Moo's head nearly followed. I think the book is lovely, and my daughter thought it was facinating too (""birs!!"") but for the next year or so we'll be sticking to the durable Spot."
2,Shiver? I don't think so,"I won't rehash the plot. I agree with other reviewers, this book could have been written on a lot less paper. So much of the book is repetitive. You don't have to write the same thing 10 times for anyone to ""get it"". The book is rather boring....very little suspense. Honestly, I could not finish it."
3,Am I missing something,"I actually am only about half way through this book, and just had to review it. Am I missing something? Isn't this supposed to be the 3rd book in the New Orleans Series? Suddenly more than 2 years have gone by since Cold Blooded, Bentz is married to the woman he'd just had a date with and we know for sure that Marta is dead?I really enjoyed Cold Blooded, I was hoping to learn more about the characters from that story, but it seems to me that I've skipped over a HUGE amount of information and just got dropped into these peoples's lives with very little context.So, like a few reviewers have said, there are a lot of editing errors, and this is in the paperback version, which should have had some time to be edited after the hard back was released.Sorta disapointed. I'll finish it, but am really wondering if I am going to bother with Absolute Fear, then next book."
3,Shiver,"There is a serial killer loose in New Orleans and he is killing people in pairs with no connection to one another. Why? Detective Reuben Montoya's only lead is with Abby Chastain, the ex-wife of one the victims. But what is her link to these grisly deaths? Lisa Jackson's SHIVER started out with some suspense and mystery, but soon failed to keep me intrigued. There was a lot of jumping around, no real character development and an easy plot to figure out. And it needed some editing. Since I borrowed this book from the library, I noticed a previous reader circled misspelled words and written question marks in various places."
4,Shiver,It started out great then it laged in the middle but as you got to where she kept going over the dreams and what happened it got to be better . I was shocked to find out who the actual person was who was doing all the mahem. I never even thought of that person. It is a ahame to know that these thigns do happen in the real world also. Kudos for bringing it to light .
2,First and probably LAST Lisa Jackson book...,"I was NOT a fan of this book. The writing wasn't that good, the plot was predictable, and the romantic element was so obvious and heavy handed, not to mention the BAD dialog. Maybe I'm just not a romantic, but I don't think romance belongs in a suspense novel."
2,Waste of time,I suffered through this book to the end hoping it would improve -- it didn't. Don't waste your time with this one. Characters are one dimensional and writing seems canned. Main characters are uninteresting and plot is over the top -- and not in a good way.
4,Got me hooked...,Being the first of Jackson's books that I read...I am now going back to the beginning of the Louisiana saga to find out as much as I can about these amazing characters. Great read!
2,weak effort,"I shouldn't have even bothered reading this one. After picking it up, I had to groan at reading yet another serial killer novel. You would think by the way they're portrayed by writers, that every fifth person in the world is a serial killer. With so many of these types of novels out there, the writer needs to do a strong job of distinguishing it from the pack. This novel not only fails to that, it doesn't work at all. The characters are weak. The plot is generic. The melodrama is constant. There is nothing remotely believable in the story. In other words, don't bother reading this. It is a waste of time.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
4,Very Good Book,"While there are sections that go on a little to long, this is still a very good book and well worth reading."
3,Good but not great,"I did enjoy the plot, although the storyline became a bit repetitive and very religious. The author spent so much time rehashing the same information that she then rushed through the romance. It happened too quickly, was pretty unrealistic and felt like an afterthought.But, the biggest problem I had with this book (and it was EXTREMELY annoying) was the lack of character development. The central male character Reuben Montoya has been in Jackson's previous books, but very little time is spent on his background in this book. During the course of the story, Reuben's past history with a woman named Marta is constantly alluded to, but never fully explained... perhaps this was a plot in a previous book, but you would think it would have been explained in detail since he is a main character! I'm still confused over that.Overall, I'd give it a B+ for mystery, a C for romance and a D for character development. Wait for it to come out in paperback."
3,too many errors,"lisa jackson is a good writer, but she needs a better editor. there were too many misused and misspelled words for my taste. for instance---she has somone ""pawning something off,"" when the correct term is ""palming off."" she also calls a crime scene ""grizzly."" last time i looked it was a bear---perhaps she meant grisly?? for god's sake, have someone check your work-preferably someone well educated."
3,Original is better,"I eat the French Twist on a regular basis in most of the flavors. For me, I wanted to taste more chocolate to satisfy my chocolate craving. Also, I thought it was a little pricey for the size of the bag and the quantity. I'm not sure I'd order again unless there was a special promotion, specifcally for the Chocolate Chip Flavor. I wish I could have bought it in a local store as I can with some of the other flavors, prior to my purchase from Amazon."
1,Crapy item,the only difference betwwen this and the one they come with is that its heavier and uglyerVERY BAD!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The Next Step in Architectural Field Identification,"For numerous years, I have been collecting field guides to American Architecture. These guides do a great job of pointing out most of the important architectural features that make up a particular style. However, often times the smaller details of the buildings are not described. This is where Cyril Harris' ""American Architecture: An Illustrated Encyclopedia"" comes to fill this gap.Most people know what a gable is. But if you want to know the difference between a bell gable, clipped gable, corbiestep gable or cross gable, this is the book for you. To further add value to the book, Harris uses numerous line drawn illustrations to add texture to his definitions. This is a highly recommended book for people who like to read buildings."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"Ok Usually I find something good to say even about the worst movies. Unfortunately, I can't find anything good about this one. The only thing that even made me give this movie 1 star was the ( heroine's )acting...and she ended up dying anyway !Aside from her, the acting was just atrocious, the villian laughably unbelieveable , and the effects we've loved from the first 2 Manglers are nowhere to be found. This is probably the worst movie I have seen this year and it should no way be associated with the original Mangler movie which kicked ass.Whether the studio needed something in a hurry to put out or not, the budget of this movie was just awful. Don't waste the money to even rent this. I'd rent Strawberry Shortcake first before I ever watched this awful piece of crap again"
2,THE MANGLER REBORN DVD REVIEW,I honestly thought that this movie was going to be REALLY terrible but it wasn't that dreadful. Sure there wasn't any point why that guy was killing people but I did want to know what would happen next.
1,MANGLED KING,"Stephen King should have sued the filmmakers for this abominable ""sequel"" to the original MANGLER. The script has none of the skill imbued in King's short story or any of the style of the original Tobe Hooper film. This one follows a middle aged plumber who buys the dreaded machine at an auction and becomes obsessed with repairing it. This leads to his being gobbled up and HE becomes a walking, killing mangler. Also involved in this mess are a father and son house burglary team, and a young girl who has just lost her job and her lover. They got trapped in the mangler's house and do innumerably stupid things, all without any real sense of suspense or credibility. The movie tries to use its gross out gore to make an impact but it ends up being sadistic and absurd. I wouldn't waste my time on this one, folks."
2,The Mangler Is Back......,"I enjoyed the very first Mangler movie, though a old movie now. I rented this movie the day it came out for it looked like it promised to be a great horror film. Well, I was disappointed like I have been in many other ""sequels"". The gore and blood scenes make me give this movie 2 stars. Other than that, the movie is neither suspenseful or thrilling. The mangler machine is rebuilt by a repairman who decides to keep the machine alive by feeding humans to it. A couple of cool scenes but that's it. This was another let down movie. Barely worth the rental fee."
1,Snore..... let the idiots die,"When an entire movie centers around a couple of pathetic idiots who can't get out of a locked house and are chased by a fat slob of a psycho killer with a hammer, my wife's comments say it all.......""these victims are so stupid they deserve to die. They are too dumb to live"".I agree with the others on here.... a terrible film"
3,Regret,I regret that I purchased this book because the industry changes very quickly and you have to be sure when purchasing a computer dictionary that it's going to be at your level of expertise. The book is very small (195 pages) I think it's great for a beginner but not for programmers or Engineers.
3,Funk!,"Maceo is an originator! Down with James Brown, this dvd is 30% talking about his childhood & career, 70% concert footage. It's better than average because of the grooves him & his band play. He's got some of his buddies that used to play with him while down with James Brown & they do a good job...I wish there was more concert & less talk, but overall, it's better than average..."
4,Classic Maceo with George Clinton Great stuff !,"If you like Maceo, James Brown or P-Funk and George Clinton, you'll love this dvd. It shows Maceo in a personal setting, talking and it's just nice to see him in that light. Then you get all the showmanship of the horns and music and a very funny interview with George Clinton. I loved the way the opening is put together with the titles jumping to the music. Put this on your home theater and crank up the volume."
5,The Best Book,"This is the cutest book. The story is so sweet, and the pictures are great. I read this book to my daughter's preschool class and they loved it. Originally, we got it from the library and my daughter enjoyed it so much, I bought it for her to keep."
5,The drummer looks like Screech,"Morning state completely rocks my face. These guys have a lot of promise. Four totally average dudes, that write off-the-beaten-path music that still manages to rock. I love your music guys. Can't wait for your next release."
5,WOW!! Pictures don't do it justice,"This is a gorgeous watch at a terrific price. My wife loves this watch. She was very skeptical about buying it this way, as the savings was over 40%. This was supposed to be a backup watch till her primary gets repaired. BAM! now it's the primary! One detail of minor note- it has no second hand."
2,Bad Binder,The binder was not as good of quality as suggested. It was broken and was on only about half the cookbook.
3,"Interesting, but not worth buying","This book contains too many goofy expressions, less dramatic work."
2,Returned the book,I found that this book was not what I expected. I was looking for a reference for fine art sketching and painting. This is more appropriate for graphic art--cartoons etc.
2,Returned,"This book was just what it stated, however, I was looking for a book of instruction for the photos included. The book was returned."
4,Oh Boy!,I am an art student with the Art Instruction School. This book is very handy to have. I enjoy skimming through the pages and picking out the various expressions to aid me in my work. There were more of this type to choose from but I can say I made a very good choice.
4,Good book,"This is currently the best photo reference, but seems to be a repeated expressions and angles.But still it's the book necessary and of great help for the study."
3,Very Interesting,"Not bad, not great. Worth buying if you're looking for inspiration and are already pretty good at drawing. Might want to save it for later if you're just starting out, like me."
2,Good for cartooning...only,"I was disappointed in this book. The small photos are certainly varied, but the expressions are far from subtle. It's chief value would be for someone drawing cartoons or anime."
1,Not good for serious sculptors,"I purchased this book to use as a reference for sculpting faces on dolls. The book shows different angles of the expressions and that was what I needed. Unfortunately what I did not need was an entire book filled with goofy expressions that you'd never even see on a human face!! There was no romantic expressions or serene, contented, laughing mildly at something mildly funny expressions. Just over the top, completely over exaggerated mutated faces! If you need some serious or normal faces, Don't buy this book."
2,"Great for Caricature, Not So Much for Subtleties","I'm an illustrator and was searching for something to use as a launch for getting facial expressions. I need subtle, human emotions, but what I got in this book was a lot of outrageous expressions. If you're doing caricature, this book would be a great resource. If you need slight lifts of the brown, a downturn of the mouth, then take your own pictures. Also, I had hoped that the photos would have been arranged by emotion, rather than by model. This forces the reader to have to look at page after page of pictures in hope of finding the right expression. It's off to a book reseller I go..."
2,Needs labels,"It's great to have all of the photographs of various people from different angles, but none of them are labeled. The author says that he asked the people in the photographs to act various feelings like ""scared, angry, etc."", but he leaves that mapping out of the book. For me, it makes it almost useless."
4,Facial Fun,"This book has very good assortment of faces that go through a set of emotions. The pictures are small and the paper isnt the greatest for photo reference, but they give you enough information.This is a good book to have in your artist reference set."
3,"Great idea, but...","The book is a great idea in terms of being a great source of different facial expressions of the same face, but the photographic quality is lacking. The photos are in black and white, which is a great idea, but there's flatness to the lighting of the faces, there's not enough contrast created by the lighting."
3,"Good, just not what I was expecting...","Not quite sure what I was expecting.It's a good book if you're bad with thinking of expressions. But as many others said, the expressions are the ""traditional"" or what I'd call muted/subtle expressions of traditional artists. It's great for cartoonists and anyone looking for a handy reference book.What i love is that it's got around 4 pages each of the same person, doing different expressions, or just the same expression from many different angels. And in the beginning it's got a few reference shots of the skull, in the back it contains some headgear photographs, and throughout there's some cute artist's representations in the form of caricatures.Overall, I'd say it was a great reference book. Definitely worth the price. Just not the most exciting piece of art reference material to look at."
4,No kids faces but its great so far!,"On recieving this book I have instantly used it as my reference material as a flash animator and designer. I needed a granny face and i just flipped to the back and found one! Although it is missing kids faces, it is a great book and Mark Simon has yet again supplied the industry with some more support and reference. Thank you!"
3,Wrong place to look,"With respect to the author (and the authors of similar books), this is the wrong place to look for facial expressions. If you want a truly valuable source, look at Paul Ekman's books. Even Darwin's book of expressions in people and animals is more useful. Most of the art instruction pose/expression books are heavy on over-the-top mugging expressions. Get a book with a scientific approach."
2,Facial exressions: a visual reference for artists,I was disappointed with this book. I'm not terribly picky but these expressions are mostly just goofy faces and not those which I would use. I needed regular expressions not absurd one's.
4,Mixed review,"Some useful photos and information. Much more a reference book than instructional, and I have to agree with the reviewer that said this is more for cartooning than portrait drawing.That being said, it's not useless. I will definately refer to it, and there are some more natural poses and useful information. I didn't think the faces were ugly, certainly intresting, but then most figures in paintings that are enjoyable to look at aren't classicly beautiful. It's not a stand alone book, but certainly one to add to your library of reference material."
2,Unhelpful in its layout,"As an artist I'd love a great book of facial expressions. Unfortunately this isn't it. It's very tedious trying to find the right expression the way this book is laid out. I need to be able to search for a specific expression, not a model type. Trying to find the right kind of dubious expression, or quizzical, confused, etc., is a mountainous chore because you have to search through all the various models. I would like to see a book with fewer models, better actors, and indexed by expression type."
3,"Judith Hamilton ""buggin"" Janesville, Wisc. USA",Endless supply of pictures of facial expressions but no instruction for beginners. Good for more experience artists.
5,A great resource for an artist,"This book contains black and white headshots of people showing different emotions. It starts with younger adults and moves through the ages. Each person is shown from different points of view of the same emotion. The personality types are varied too. Not just glamour girls and boys, average Americans of different ethnicities. As an illustrator this is a big help."
5,Excellent reference for drawing comics,"I'd used this book often when drawing my manga. However do note that the facial expressions are mostly very exaggerated. When drawing my characters talking or just a gentle smile, I could not find reference from there.I'd to use a mirror. I hope there's a volume two with two people interacting with each other and different camera angles."
4,good drawing book,i thought the book was something different from what i ordered. but i guess its good for artists
4,"Excellent somewhat ""older"" mono recording of Mozart's ""Coronation Mass""","I purchased this CD primarily to review the Mozart for a performance I was doing as a soloist. While I did not listen too critically, it's a fine recording, though I'm spoiled by the technology of stereo recordings, so that was a bit of a let down. I have not listened to the Bruchner at this point."
5,A very readable description of Win32.,"A very good book. Don't let the word ""Advanced"" scare you off. For anyone who wants a better understanding of how it all works, this is the place to start. Richter knows how to write as well as what he talks about, a winning combination"
4,Doing serious Win32 Development? YES. Then get this book.,"Anyone doing serious Windows development using the base Win32 API's must have this book. It covers intermediate and advanced usage of the file system, DLL's, memory architecture, memory management, thread synchronization, memory mapped files, and a host of other more advanced topics. The coverage of the various subjects is complete and the code examples well written. Really anyone doing development under the Win32 API will benefit greatly from this book. Get it. I hope this helps J."
1,Not a good tecnical manual,"This book is difficult to read, and doesn't provide sufficient information to follow along. If you want a book that will help you with advanced programming techniques, this book is NOT the one to choose."
4,"Try ""Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows""","I believe ""Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows"" is the fourth edition to this book. The Microsoft Press summary for the new book says ""This fully updated expansion of the bestselling ADVANCED WINDOWS digs even deeper into the advanced features...""And after comparing the table of contents of the two books, I decided to buy ""Programming Applications"" instead of this book."
4,Papers from 1994 Summit on Learning Disabilities,"Papers on adults with learning disabilities from the 1994 Summit on Learning Disabilities organized by the National Center for Learning Disabilities. Topics include education, labor, justice, and health and human services. The section on employment is interesting and includes perspectives from several adults with learning disabilities who can serve as role models.This review was originally published in the Annotated Bibliography of Learning A Living, A Guide to Planning Your Career and Finding A Job for People with Learning Disabilities, Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia."
1,Visually poor.,"I thought the quality of video was quite cheap looking. The actor was hardly better than a cardboard cutout. It had some useful recipes, but it was not too interesting to look at."
4,Somewhat different!,"If your looking for something different, than pick up this collection. Although the songs sound familar, most of them are mixed differently than the studio albums you may be familar with. Much of the earlier tracks sound like demos and at times can be distracting but interesting. Give this disc a listen and you will understand what I'm talking about."
4,Good product,I have used Hempz products since I discovered then. The Pomegranate Herbal Body Wash works well for alleviating dry skin
3,It wasn't good but it wasn't bad.,I thought it would be more moisterizing than what it was. I didn't dry my skin out but it didn't make it feel soft and smooth afterwards. I wasn't crazy about the smell either. I love the body cream so I thought I'd really like the body wash. I won't purchase it again.
3,Nice but not what I was looking for,"This stylus has good weight and the chrome makes it look very stylish. I own a palm IIIc and this stylus is much better than the stylus that it comes with. The problem that I have with this stylus is that it doesn't fit perfectly in the slot holder for the stylus. It is slightly too big and it has a tendency to fall out. The orange point is makes it easier to see but the fact that it does not have a spring, like some more expensive models, makes it seem very rigid on the screen. I would recommend this stylus if you use it as a starter stylus. A pentopia stylus has a spring and a pen and at the price makes it a much better stylus."
5,This stylus fixed my Palm,"My IIIc had developed a bad spot in the center of its alpha-writing area which was not receptive to stylus input, causing horribly mangled character recognition. I bought a foldaway keyboard in a desperate bid to extend its useful life, but it wasn't portable enough.I got the PDA Panache stylus on a whim. Maybe it's just gentle enough on the screen that it seems safer and more natural to press a tiny bit harder ... but regardless, the bad spot becomes MUCH less noticeable when I'm using this stylus.Other points: The nail-head top makes for a snug fit in the IIIc's stylus holder; no danger of falling out. Nice weighty feel and grooves for finger grip. The orange tip is so gentle on the screen that I'm hesitant to use the original plastic stylus -- for fear of (further) damaging my Palm!I had been considering replacing my Palm before I got this stylus. Now, I simply don't need to."
4,Great but expensive.,"If you like stylish, then choose this. If not, then get another product. It does the same thing. Amazon, keep up the good work."
1,sadly disappointed,"Based on its cover, which let's face it, is how we buy decorating books, this one looked really interesting and quite sumptuous. Unfortunately, the contents did not live up to the cover and featured rooms and ideas that are already beginning to look ""dated"". There were no ideas for creating a rich or monied decorating style and the text was rather ""homespun"". Having bought it on sale, I was very glad I hadn't paid full price; I would have been most disappointed."
1,cover deceiving...inside looks something from 70's and 80's,"I was very disapointed with this book. For a book that was published in 2001 all but a few of the photo's look dated. Way overdone, dark and heavy for today's style. Even the photography has a dated grainy look. Jo credits her parents as the ones who encouraged her to accomplish her dreams by learning. Well Jo, as an interior designer myself with 20+ years under my belt...you need to go back to square one and learn some new material."
3,"Full of great ideas, but not all of them practical.","Jo Packham proves that you can have a beautiful home without spending a fortune. Success depends on buying only what you love and arranging it well, not on how much you spend. Jo starts with a terrific section on creative wall treatments and then continues with various ways to accessorize the home. Many of her ideas are excellent, such as using inexpensive fabrics in luxurious ways. Others sound like she is giving how-to's on creating a window-display, not a home. How does someone use towels that are tied together with beaded tassels, or put wet soap back in the seashell soap dish without getting water drops on the fan underneath? Tucking fancy dishtowels over cupboard doors may look pretty, but they have to be re-arranged each time the door is opened.All in all, a good book for those who want ideas on creative ways to decorate with what they love without spending a great deal of money."
5,Not bad,Good plugs. I had to regap them because none of them where even close to the gaps I needed for my Speed. I have had them on for about 300 miles now with no problems. They are also holding up during my E85 tune.
3,Not a whole NEW THING!,"I enjoyed the movie. I understand that sexually coming out for the young man is a whole new thing for him personally, but the subject matter is NOT a Whole New Thing.It is not a horrible movie, but I would not claim it to be one of my favorite stories about a young man having a crush on his school teacher. Worth seeing."
3,"Good program, annoying presentation","I really like a lot of what Ms. Roth has to say, but was extremely disappointed because in purchasing this audio-book, I was hoping that I was acquiring a resource that I could turn to for comfort, as I do with some of my other Sounds True audio-books. That will not be the case with this one, unfortunately, because I find Ms. Roth's voice inflections to be exceedingly annoying at times. When she speaks normally, I have no problem, but I actually take my ear-buds out when she uses her dramatic or sarcastic voice (which is a lot). Bummer.I just bought a couple of her books. Hopefully her writing style isn't annoying."
5,Great lens!,"This is a great lens. Every photographer should have this lens in their kit. I've spent the last few days shooting pictures of almost everything I see and I am blown away by the quality of the pictures - sharp with excellent colors. The lens is very fast and can take pictures in low light conditions that give even Canon's IS lens difficulty - certainly when you consider the cheap price of this lens versus some of the other Canon offerings.The few inconsequential negatives is the focusing mechanism is slow and noisy (old style) but strangely charming. It certainly *sounds* like an SLR lens unlike the newer USM models that are very quiet. And sometimes it has trouble focusing but in my experience it does well the vast majority of the time. Finally, you cannot manually focus while autofocus is engaged.I am pretty sure this will be my standard walk around lens for the majority of the time."
4,Great for the price,"Pro:Small, light, fast f2 (good enough for most low light), great IQ stop down, beats zooms hands down. (Just did some test under perfect light shooting grass and trees)Neutral:Build, MF, no hood included (as expected of course, thanks to Canon), AF fastCon:AF whiny, worse than my Tamron zoom and Sigma non-HSMs.Use this with 40D, don't know how good (or bad) it is on FF, but being around for this long, there must be a reason for Canon. Overall, I'd say it's not that different from Canon 100 f2, and maybe slightly better than my 50 f1.4 in resolution. Only the AF is a bit lacking. Great for crop sensor cameras."
4,Good lens,"This is a good lens. And take nice pictures. After testing it, this lens takes better pictures than the canon EF 17-40mm f/4.0 L. However as far as I am concerned it is still not wide enough (after 1.6x crop factor) for landscapes. It is also kinda noisy."
4,Basic 35mm lens,"This is a great low priced prime lens. While it lacks any zoom, it has a great DOF and crisp clear image. It is a bit noisy, but more than makes up for it with quality and small size. Highly recommended entry level lens for quick easy photos, and that old 35mm experience and shot."
4,Great lens,I'd look for a while for this lens. To be honest i would say that i was a little disappointed for the noise but the images quality is excellent!
1,so so even for a plastic,"I am a pro photographer and bought this to replace the 50 mm f/1.4 (a mistake .. now i can see!). I replaced the 50mm initially because it was not sharp enough albeit a good construction and felt it was a quality lens. This lens costs the same so I felt it should be about the same quality even if in terms of aperture it is a bit of a step backwards relative to the f/1.4 of the 50mm... but I was wrong. The 35mm f/2 is a HUGE step backwards in every direction. Every time I put it on the camera I feel like I will break it.. it is like a plastic toy. It is small and light, which is great. But it is soft... way too soft.. not too great. I have yet to get a sharp shot from this lens. Lesson learned: get the L series next time. Simply not worth $10 in my opinion."
3,Not as good as zoom,"I returned this lens after comparing it to my Canon 24-105.It wasn't as good, in the center or the corners."
2,"canon wide angle lens, ef 35mm, not wide enough",I thought this would solve my group picture problems. NOT! The field of view is about the same as my 18-55 mm lens. I will double-check the specs before I buy another WIDE angle lens.
5,Canon EF 35mm f/2 review,Lens is small and light and gives you a classic 50mm type of view. It is VERY sharp at wide open.
3,It's just OK,"I originally bought this lens because a 35mm is the closest you can get to a 50mm full frame equivalent on a Cannon Rebel T3i. I mainly use my camera for portrait work. I also have a Cannon EF50 F/1.4 USM and I have to say that I still like shooting with the 50mm better. The lens is noisier, colors don't seem as bright, distortion is higher, and auto focus is slower. It just seems over-priced for what it is. It's still good for those situations where you want a particular shot and don't have the space, but I probably would have been better off putting the money I spend back in my pocket and started saving for an L-Series lens."
3,Nice Pictures but VERY VERY LOUD!,Takes wonderful pictures for the price. But the other reviews were right in auto focus this thing is is crazy loud. It sounds like the gears are grinding. In a quiet setting it would be very distracting. But for the price I would still recommend this for a beginner or for a backup.
2,Had problems with this lens,"I am sorry to say after reading all the information and good responses on this item, I did order it. Yes, I loved the price!However, I had nothing but problems. It simply did not take good quality pictures and they certainly were not sharp as some others had posted.Maybe it needed to be calibrated but I don't want to go through the send it back and hope.On the plus side, I was extremely impressed with Amazon and the seller for their easy, no hassle return.Thank you so much,S.B."
2,Surprised none of these reviews mention this...,"The Chromatic Aberration (purple fringing on bright objects) with this lens is just awful. Stop your lens down to f2 and take a photo of a brightly lit chrome faucet. Look closer. See it? Try stopping down to f5.6 or even f11. Sure it gets a little better, but it's still there.This lens is frustrating! I'm selling mine!"
4,"Cheap, Fast, 56mm Equivalent","This lens is a good value if you're looking for a 50mm equivalent (actually 56) for your 1.6 crop-factor dSLR (30D, 20D, XT, XTi).The design is a bit dated, and it suffers from slow and noisy autofocus, and pretty bad ghosting. But, this is the lens that lives on my camera the most.Especially great for low-light conditions!"
1,Artic White - poor service,"Product support is lacking. Tried the product as instructed - difficult to make the trays as specified. At least two gel packets were received leaking. Caused extra teeth sensitivity -more than I was accustomed to from other products. Contacted the company about returning. It was difficult to make contact and after finally receiving instructions, I returned the remaining product at my expense which was over two thirds of what was received. I never received a refund or a response. I just gave up and wrote it off as a bad experience with a bad company."
5,Great Design - Easy to use,"Great Design I've owned this roll for over 12 years and no trouble. This roll has two gearings, one (like on all the others) for fast rolling of thin stock, and a lower gearing for heavy material. On the lower gearing I routinely roll 10ga pieces a foot wide and more. I have also rolled 3/16 stainless 5"" pieces on this setting. Be sure to get the Optional floor stand."
3,Histry of BK!,"BK (Burger King) is a British coorporation. It is popular in Europe and US. BK is also known as an innovator of HIYW (Have It Your Way), BOGO (Buy One Get One free), IJTB (It Just Tastes Better). Interesting book for first food lovers."
5,A wonderful overview,"Colin Tudge's The Variety of Life is a great overview of life on Earth. If you ever wondered where a particular type of animal or plant fit into the world ecosystem, this book will tell you. It covers not just living plants and animals but also fossil forms - every thing that ever lived. It is easy to use and clear in its descriptions - a good reference for college and highschool students taking biology. It does not talk down, but explains its points clearly and simply. I can not recommend it enough - and I do recommend it to my students."
1,Lacked information,"I wish I could say smothing better, but this book was not much help to me. It did not offer any practicle ideas that I can implement into my career."
3,GI joe,This GI JOE book is alright for basic information and pictures of the figures and accessories available. I wish it had more detailed info about each piece and more pricing options. Other than that it is a good book.
2,Don't bother,This guide is very incomplete! It only has the basic figures and uniforms only up to the 1990's even though it just came out in print in 2006.
5,Possibly the best herb book on the market!,"As a nutritionist and natural health educator, I highly recommend Pharmacist's Guide to Medicinal Herbs. It's well-researched, fun to read, and easy to find what you're looking for. Dr. Presser has managed to present scientifically credible information while maintaining a style of writing which is not only easy to read, but clearly reflective of his wonderful sense of humor. Furthermore, Pharmacist's Guide to Medicinal Herbs is especially important at this time since we currently live in an age of self-prescription regarding herbs. Up-to-date information is extremely important to help consumers make educated decisions. Dr. Art Presser's book is just what the doctor ordered. As a matter of fact, doctors who are interested in integrating herbal medicine into their practice should read Pharmacist's Guide to Medicinal Herbs too."
5,Near Perfection,"I've found this to be probably one of the best stylus' available for the Palm Vx out on the market? Why? Because of its slim design and great feel when writing.Many of the styli's used are bulky and just plain ugly. But, this black color makes the Panache very sleek and eye catching. Plus, its lightweight yet good feel in writing on the Palm Vx allows the user to write with ease.When using the stock stylus that's included with the Palm Vx, I was afraid that I might scratch the screen. But, now I can write with confidence in knowing that the Panache writing tip is gentle enough to take care of my Palm Vx screen.The only thing I would add onto this stylus would be a pen. That would actually come in handy, but for now, this is one stylus to get your hands on!"
2,"Sure it's got panache, but not much else...","It's cute, i don't like the plastic one the palm V comes with so i like the idea of a replacement stylus, but this just isn't the one. For the same price, the Chameleon stylus looks very similar with a metal barrel and better tip as well as has a pen on the other side.This one looks good, but doens't have much else going for it."
5,Near Perfection,"This is probably the second best stylus that can be found for the Palm Vx. The only thing missing is the pen feature, but everything else is perfect. I think that its size and weight are perfectly fitted for the style of the Palm Vx.When compared the the stock stylus that comes with the Palm Vx, this one blows it away! The original stylus that's included with the Palm Vx is bulky and feels like you might scratch the screen if you press too hard. The Panache stylus makes writing on the Palm Vx a cinch without a worry of whether or not the screen might be eternally scratched (unless you pay to fix the screen!).All in all, this is the best bang for your buck, so get one soon!"
3,Not Stuck on It,"I didn't realize when I purchased this product that it's on a clear background. Therefore, it didn't show up when I stuck it to the window of my car."
4,The best sponge,"This is a great sponge. Soft, but durable. I think it's better than Bath & Body Works sponges. It's definitely cheaper! And, since it comes in a 12-pack, it sure beats having to buy a new one all the time. The only minor complaint is the hand strap. A small rope would've been better. The strap is made of the same material as the sponge, but stretches. There aren't as many places for it to hang when not in use."
3,National Theatre Of The Deaf (NTD),"If you are interested in learning about Deaf culture and entertainment, this is a book well worth your while. It is filled with information as to how the NTD came to be, who the founding members were (as well as members beyond that time), what plays were performed up until the writing of the book. There are some photographs as well.A good bok with good information, but not the most exciting read you'll find. It's also not up to date, but it gives you a good idea. Recommended by this deafie. :v)"
3,It was okay,I thing gza could have done better on this album the beats werent really that great and if I cant feel the beat I cant feel the song even if the lyrics are tight.
3,"It says explicit content, but where?","I just got this album for Christmas! I think it's GZA's second best album next to Liquid Swords, but where are the explicit lyrics. The album cover has the parental advisory label on it, but there is no need for it. Every track that has a curse, is either cut off, or substituted with sword slashes. What gives? There must have been a problem at where they packaged and shipped these at. I read some reviews though that say they have edited versions too. This is the only thing that makes this album not a 5 star. My Cd was bought at Best Buy. If anyone knows where I can get the ""real"" explicit content album, please let me know. ...Thanks, but aside the cut curses, the album is really good."
4,Legend of the liiquid sword,The only problem i have with this album that it isvery repetitive and almost every song sounds like aduplicate of the next well i have another problemwith the album as well it sounds like the gza isusing a bunch of big words trying to sound deep butit comes across sounding redundant and lameOverall it is a good outting for the genius!
1,"Does not deserve to be called ""legend""","This is not classic GZA. This is not GZA at his best either.The one star that is given is for the one track that is o.k. This CD sounded too mainstream compared to previous GZA work. I don't want to say that you have lost your touch, but come on Genius! I know you can do better. Liquid Swords was a hard act to follow, but you did it with Beneath the Surface. And now this?What is this? It sounds like each song was done in 2 minutes flat! I sorry but this album doesn't deserve to have the word ""legend"" in it. I was waiting for this CD to come out and I was disapointed. No thumbs-up for this one. Save youself the anguish and get a copy of ""Fresh Mode"" by Ugly Duckling"
3,GZA lyrical frontman of wu-tang,"this is album is pretty dope,when gza dropped liquid swords that album was absolutley ridiculous,great production and great lyricism,heads are still feeding off this album, now that legend of the liquid sword dropped, gza hasnt lost a step, right from the first track its ill,theres like 1 or 2 songs i wasnt really into(beatwise) lyrically gza can go all day and he can go untouched thats why hes the genius.. i reccomend this lp for true hip hop heads..."
1,Is it just me?,"I bought this cd at target and it had a parental advisory sticker on it. However when I listened to it, it sounded edited. For instance, the chorus in the lead single ""Knock Knock"" dubs out the f word. On track 8, RZA says you can't F#*ck with the Wu Tang, but instead of F*$K, it just has sword slashing sounds. I returned this cd to a different Target thinking that the previous one had a bad shipment or something. Well, the new cd was exactly the same, so I'm assuming that they're all like that. My friend even downloaded a few songs on the net and he said that he had those sword slashing sounds over cuss words also. If anyone knows of a version that actually cusses, please let me know by writing a review. I hate edited cds; that's why a gave this one star. If it wasn't edited, it would be off the hook."
2,Legend Of The Liquid Sword is ok,"Ok album, a few good beats, but nothing amazing, or as good as GZA could of done. Wu tang hasnt been on since their first classic album. I prefer the new Nas cd."
5,this is junior's review,I think legin of the liquid sword is tight.It has bomb beats i never get tierd of it.Their floes are crazy status and if you dont got their CD then your wour's than the word wak!.For those who have it ride on.All ways remember the saga continues Wu- tang.WHAT YOU GOT ON THAT!!!
5,Typical GZA,"the album is hot. don't really like how some of it seems to be edited, but the beats and rhymes are tight."
5,Truly A Genius,"Undeniably one of the greatest lyricists of all time. The track, ""Fame"" is mind-blowing. In fact, they all show why the Gza is said by fellow Wu Tang members to be ""the head"" of the clan. Get this album...and see if you can keep up with the Gza's incredible conscious flow. This guy is just too much. Peace"
2,Pillow Case Dmensions,"Material was satisfactory - but not the dimensions of the pillow cases. Too smallto contain king sized pillows. Really scrunched and not happy with this purchasebecause of this.If manufacturers are now changing the 'usual dimensions' on king sized pillow cases- it'd be nice to make it noticeable to purchasers - as it sure was news to me.Therefore - passing this info on to others so they may consider this.Being the pillow cases were washed first in cool water before putting on the pillows- did not send these back, but disappointed with this company's products.Thank you..."
3,Sheets don't fit,I ordered the King set of these sheets. They are very comfortable and cool. The only problem is they wrinkle up a lot as if they were made for California King instead of regular King.
5,Cool stuff,"This hitch receiver is perfect designed and match my 2006 Rendezvous, and the installation guide is simple and clear enough for DIY. It took me 2 hours to install...of course this is first time, if I do it second time, it won't exceed an hour!"
4,Joy Division still rocks,"A good book. Some nice pictures. If you're like me and weren't listening to Joy Division while they were around, it's a very good book for getting to know the whole scene and some of the basics of Ian's life.All of the best to Deborah and their child.There's a beautiful picture of Ian Curtis by the microphone with a black background."
5,IAN CURTIS DEPRESSED GENIUS,"AL LEER ESTE LIBRO ME HE DADO CUENTA DE MUCHAS COSAS QUE YO NO SABIA SOBRE TAN FABULOSO CANTANTE , COMO LO ES IAN CURTIS , UNA DE LAS RAZONES POR LA CUAL COMPRE ESTE LIBRO ..FUE PARA ENTERARME MAS DE LA VIDA INTIMA DE TAN GENIAL CANTANTE , QUERIA TRATAR DE INTRODUCIRME EN SU CABEZA Y DARME CUENTA DE DONDE SALIAN TAN EXTRANAS CANCIONES ..DE DONDE SALIA TANTA OBSCURIDAD..(LO CUAL ES LO QUE MAS ADORO)LA OBSCURIDAD DE VUESTRAS CANCIONES ME HAN DEJADO SIN ALIENTO MUCHISIMAS VECES Y NO ME CANSO DE OIR SUS CANCIONES UNA Y OTRA VEZ ...ES UN BUEN LIBRO PARA TODO AQUE QUE SEA UN FANATICO DEL GRAN GRUPO BRITANICO .""JOY DIVISION"" Y AUN SI NO LO SON .POR LO MENOS SI SON AMANTES DE LA LITERATURA ..ES UN BUEN LIBRO EN TODO EL SENTIDO ..OS GUSTARA ..OS LO PROMETO"
4,Touching from a Distance book,"I received what I ordered, on time & in good condition. However, it was mailed to my billing address and not the shipping address I indicated. As this was a surprise gift for my boyfriend, I was disappointed that it did not ship to the correct address."
1,When does 1 item constitute an assembly?,"Part FC212, Oil Filler Cap Assembly on a GM parts website specifies this includes the cap and oil fill tube. Granted, there was no such detail to the description on Amazon. It simply said AC Delco FC212 Oil Filler Cap Assembly.So to answer my own question, 1 item becomes an assembly when you expect the same part number on two sites to mean the same thing!"
3,Nice looking but too fragile!,"I got one of these cute lil' ""beans"" for a present, and it was extremely adorable. Nice feel when you hold it in your palm. (Received quite a bit of ooh's and ahh's among my friends!)But there was some sort of a bug when I installed Sonic Stage. With some frustation I got it solved, finding that SS was a very bad software. You cannot drag files directly into the bean. SS also makes your computer very slow.Then, just as I was starting to enjoy this little guy, it fell from my table and went bad. A table no more than 3 feet and with a carpet on the floor! Now the bean does not funtion properly--its keys are extremely sticky (does not respond regularly) and there is a big ugly crack.I am now planning to send it back--or maybe buy a new mp3 that is tougher.Still, the bean is really really cute--if you are careful enough!!"
2,"Not bad, didn't hold up though against competitors","I wouldn't recommend it, too many other mp3's to choose from. Go with the others."
4,"Software not great, but best portable design","I had a Sony bean for about 18 months until I dropped it and broke the volume/song selector toggle. Actually, that was the fourth or fifth time that I had dropped it, but the only time that did any damage. I really wish that this device was still available, as it seems that Sony discontinued it. Mine didn't have a ton of memory, but it was unbelievably easy to use.I loved how easy it was to switch between songs, playlists, and repeat styles on the go, no need to even take it out of my pocket. I have not found a single other mp3 player that lets me use it on the go without pulling it out and looking through things. I hate the design of iPods and the newer Sony players are nowhere near as easy to use on the go."
5,"The coolest littttle gadget, much nicer than the ipod Shuffle","Wow This Baby is sooooooooooo nice. I don't have any comments at all other than the software it comes with is clunky, but just DL from sonys web page and its much easy to use. I do think 512mb is a bit small, so maybe go for the 1gb instead. I love this thing, its PERFECT for when i workout or play poker. The hidden USB plus is the coolest feature about this gadgets, it is spring loaded behind a small little door. Man this is nice. Give it a try!"
1,Don't bother...,"Nice piece of hardware... Everything I was looking for, retractable USB, rechargable battery... Sounds pretty simple and if they kept it that way it would have been real nice... But it looks like Sony was trying to impose their standards through hardware... The software is ugly and painfully slow.. My biggest complaint is that you can't just drag and drop MP3, WAV or WMA files on to the device using windows explorer... Well, you can but you can't play them... Anything you want to listen to has to go through the Sonic stage software to be converted to OMG format, which is very slow as well as unnecessary (in my opinion).. So you can't just go up to any computer, plug it in copy files and listen to them... Looks like I just bought an expensive thumb drive..."
4,"Easy to use, lightweight","This is my first portable mp3 player and it took me about an hour to go from taking it out the box to having music on it and for me to learn how to work the controls. I did have to read the manual for a few minutes to understand what ""hold"" meant on the screen - but other than that - very nice little product, good price, and very easy to use."
2,Save your money! Don't buy it!,"I had it replaced four times and got totally fed up. For all four times, the on-board battery died and the entire unit had to be replaced. I urge you to stay away from media player units, like this one, that have permanent on-board battery systems that you can't replace yourself! You're better off purchasing an mp3 player that has a battery you can remove and replace easily without help. I ended up purchasing a SanDisk Sansa c200 series media player and am extremely happy with it!"
2,I thought it was good...,"At first, I got it for christmas, and it was great, great sound and great all around. Then my first problem came, I couldn't download ANY songs off the conect store and the support team was no help what so ever. And then a couple days ago, I dropped it on the ground maybe a 2 foot drop and it will not turn on. So know I am going to buy a new mp3, and it won't be a bean!"
1,Please Read this before you invest your cash in this product!!!!,"First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have toadvise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacementinsurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphonesalways pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!!!"
4,The Bean works great for more casual users.,"I wanted an MP3 player mostly for the gym. I got a Bean because it was half the price of an ipod, and was super small and light and could be held naturally while running. I mostly just transfer CDs to it, and it takes less than a minute to tranfer the whole CD. I've had no problems downloading single songs from Sony Connect, either. The sound quality is fine, and the battery lasts a really long time. One of the most convenient features is that you can plug the Bean directly into your computer, with no cords to worry about. Overall, it's met my needs perfectly."
2,mediocre player at best,"I got this player as a gift. Sony requires me to install the Sonic Forge software in order to use the music player. My mp3 files were transferred OK, but some of them do not play on the music player. No explainations were issued, except a ""no play"" message.No mp4 files support either, which means music downloaded from Apple music store are not playable."
2,Too fragile!,"I bought one of these. Absolutely loved it. And then I dropped it and knocked it against the side of my hand. And the electronics went bonkers. And I couldn't turn it on/off, change the tuner, adjust the volume, etc. But I loved my little bean. The sound is crystal clear and the radio reception is superb. It's easy to handle and easy to recharge and who could ask for more? So I bought another one. Loved it too. And it's worked well for several months until yesterday. I dropped it. The electronics went bonkers. I can't turn it on/off, change the tuner, adjust the volume ... get the picture? It's just too fragile. I won't buy another one. Too bad."
1,Sony Sucks,"Buying this product was a huge mistake. I urge you to refrain from buying any type of Sony product that uses Sony Connect. It is the worst software when it comes to adding music to the player.The player itself was okay, great battery life, so-so screen, great idea with the USB connect. All of this is washed out because of Sony Connect. It makes adding music to the player because of share rights. Basically CD's that you own and burn to your computer are useless. Customer service is terrible. That's right Sony, I am calling you out of your hole. I will never buy another Sony product (which I consider their other proucts great) because of my distaste for Sony Connect.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I HATE YOU SONY!"
3,Unsharp until f 2.8. If you need lowlight buy the 50 1.2,"With all the mixed reviews of the 50 1.2L's ability focus and the plastic build of the 50 1.8, I figured this would be a great affordable lens to add to my arsenal. The #1 reason for me to buy this lens was for its lowlight capabilities. As a wedding photographer, at this range, I live off of the 24-70 2.8L, but it just isn't ""hand-holdable"" in a dark room (ie wedding reception). Unfortunately the untold secret of this lens is that it is completely unsharp until it gets to about f2.8. The color saturation is great, the weight makes it a dream to hold for a couple of hours, but it doesn't do what I need it to: shoot decently sharp between f1.8-f2.8. Until I cash in for the 50 2.8 I'll keep this lens as a walk-around when I'm not on the job I need the sharpness of an the L. For serious portraits and weddings, paying clients deserve better."
1,1 Year Max,"I have had 2 of these lenses on my Canon 40D. When the lens works, it's simply great. But on each lens, right after the 1 year mark -- boom. Auto focus dies. 2 for 2. If this lens would last over a year, it would be fantastic."
1,"Beware, Buy at your own risk","The lens has totally crapped out after 50 or so photos and 14 months on the shelf with some other lenses.No AF and will not adjust the aperture, So basically it is dead and send it in for $150 repair with the threat of it doing it again or just eat it. I think I will eat it. I am so mad at Canon.Beware"
1,Great lens before its not...,"Like many of the reviews note... this is a great lens for the price before it stops working.After 3 strikes I am moving to a different lens. Strike One: Auto focus and manual focus died in a month -- lens was replaced by store. Strike Two: Auto focus and manual focus died after warranty expiration -- Canon repair said I must have bumped it. Don't think I did. Charged $96 for repair. Strike Three -- lens focusing died again 10 months later.I like this lens, have taken good care of it (I guess I should say them), but there is a definite quality/durability issue."
2,disappointment with early AF failure,"I purchased an EF 50mm 1:1.4 for my new EOS Rebel XTi about 6 wks ago. It worked great for about 70 shots, then the autofocus abruptly quit working and has not worked since.My other two lenses, the standard EFS 18-55,and an EFS 70-300mm, both work fine in AF mode.The EF 50mm lens takes very good pictures in MF mode,but I am very disappointed that this lens failed so soon. I would otherwise rate it a 5 as far as quality is concerned."
5,Canon EF 50mm F/1.4 USM,"Great quality for your first prime lens at this price. I use it as a portrait lens, would not use it for group pictures. Next lens would be a Canon EF 28mm f/1.8 USM."
4,"Inexpensive fast prime, but buy a hood!","This lens is quite fast. It captures pictures in low light wonderfully on my crop camera. I'm sure the performance would be even better with full frame. This is the only lens I use if I know I'm going to be indoors at some point. I'm not a pixel peeper, but the picture quality is great. I am sure other reviewers with far better training than I have provided adequate descriptions of the picture quality.At any rate, the focus mechanism looks to be quite delicate. The barrel extends from the front of the lens when focusing. This lens is known to have some problems with backfocus or soft focus that I would guess are a product of the barrel being knocked when extended. I wouldn't carry this lens without a hood. I bought an inexpensive third party hood from Amazon and it works great."
1,Piece of Crap,"I bought this lens tempted by Amazon's price drop on it. I have to respectfully disagree with other comments that compare this lens with the L line. Just out of the box I could feel the cheap construction, mostly made of cheap plastic. The focusing ring feels inaccurate and loose, with a short play before it takes action. I returned this lens immediately. I wish Canon was more straightforward about informing customers that everything that is not an L line lens (although some L zoom lens may be questionable too) is just hopeless toys for the unaware or under demanding amateur. Serious photographers beware. This lens is NOT an upgrade from the already crappy (but at least justifiable for the price) EF 50mm 1.8 it's the same type of construction and it is not worth around [...] at all. Honest and reputable retailers must receive a lot of heat and returns of this lens from unsatisfied customers. Don't do it. Save your money for the EF 1.2 L."
3,Disappointed,I wait much time to see if the price dropped and finally when I bought it just two days then the price dropped by 15$ thanks to amazon.It really disappointed to me :( THats why I give it 3 stars and also the quality is not as I have read and I knew it is the same as 18-55 maybe my lens is better
4,Still Waiting,"This lens has received excellent reviews so I won't repeat what others have already stated. I ordered this lens on March 20 with a shipping estimate of ""usually within 24hrs"". I just received an updated ship date range of May 5th - May 15th. If you are in a hurry for this lens it might be best to look elsewhere."
3,ADORAMA SUCKS,"i'm not giving this item 1 star because it is not a bad item, but since it was impossible to leave feedback for Adorama I'm leaving it here.Canon EF 50mm f1.4 feedback: ***1. it takes good shots - it's a 1.4 lens after all - not bad2. many people say that this lens doesn't feel cheap compared to other lens, but it's not true - it feels very light and cheap to me3. the focusing ring is very loose - hard to believe you'd be counting on it to focus withAdorama feedback: *1. it shipped with a 10-day delay when was marked as ""In stock"" when I ordered it2. it came completely off focus - 12 inches away from where I'm aiming3. no option to leave Sellers Feedback anywhere4. no option for replacement - it's good I can return it thougha similar thing happened with my 85mm prime lense i got from amazon/adorama - it came off focus, i replaced it and the new one came off focus as well - go figure. and no - it's not my camera - tested on 30D, 50D and 7D."
2,Canon 50mm f1.4,"I bought this lens 5 days ago and fell in love the instant I saw the pictures. Used it all weekend and loving the lens until I set the camera on the tripod (about a foot high)and accidentally bumped into the tripod. Next thing you know, camera & lens falls on the carpet floor. Camera was fine but the lens now doesn't want to focus. I hear the motor and the focus ring is slightly moving but feels very tight. Even though I'm able to turn the focus ring, the distance scale shows that it's stuck on infinity. I've read reviews that this is a very sharp lens but the build quality is really bad. I truly believe that now. It will cost me over $100 to fix this lens on top of the $350+ that I already spent, considering I've only had this lens for 5 days. Picture is awesome but build quality is really bad."
1,Skip the headache and the heartache and go for a better lens,"I love all my canon gear. I have a 50mm 1.8 and upgraded to this as I have progressed in my photography. Unfortunately, I have had the same sort of trouble the other reviews have stated. At this point I only have had trouble with the focus under f2.2. Every shot lost in two photo shoots and I had not realized until after researching on the internet as to why.No trouble with the AF failing as of yet, but I'm pretty disgusted that I have to redo two shoots - wasting both my time and the models time. Shame on you Canon!"
4,great lens!,"Great lens , takes beautiful pics. The lens cap has a scratch on it, hoping that doesn't mean it was dropped. It was shipped in a bubble lined envelope, not enough protection in my opinion. Could've used a box or at least wrapped it in more bubble wrap."
4,Nice lens but soft :(,"I had a 50mm 1.4, build quality was better then my 50mm 1.8 but not as nice as my 85mm 1.8. Has beautiful bokeh but is just too soft for my taste. I guess I got spoiled with my 50mm f1.8."
4,Best lens for price,This lens is the best lens you can get for the price. The cheap brand Sigma was more expensive and less quality.I would definitly recommend this lens.
2,F1.4 autofocus problems,"When this lens works it is fantastic. Beautiful pictures, great performance even in lower light. Unfortunately, it hs died on me twice (autofocus). The first time Canon fixed it under warranty, mentioning something about a cracked housing or something. The lens has been well taken care of so I don't know what that's about. Recently, it started having the same autofocus problem again. It starts by not being able to focus on close objects. Now it just won't focus at all, not even manually. The lens weighs a lot more than the 1.8, but I don't think that translates to better quality components. Everything is plastic inside with relatively loose tolerances. I probably would have just gotten the 1.8 if I knew I was getting a short-lived lens. Very disappointing. Anyone considering buying this lens may want to reconsider."
5,Beautiful,Worth the step up from the 1.8 - much happier with this one. Does everything I want it to do.
2,Doesn't wow me,"To me, this lens is just okay. The IQ is good, but I don't know if it's $250 good (the price difference over the 1.8 version). The build quality is definitely better - it's one of the reasons I bought it, after my 1.8 practically fell apart in my hands one day. I don't find the AF any better though - it hunts in lighting where other lenses work fine, and the colors just seem flat. Maybe I just got a bad copy, and need to send it in before the warranty is up, but I find myself forcing myself to use this lens to justify the purchase. Plenty of people love it, though, so I would recommend trying before you buy, or buy it somewhere where you can return it without issue if you end up not liking it."
5,Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Standard & Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras,A GREAT PRODUCT WITH VERY GOOD BUILD QUALITY.THE 1.4F GIVES A VARY GOOD ADVANTAGE SPATIALLY IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS.DEFINITELY A MAST HAVE FOR A BUGGERING WITH DSLR.
5,Must have lens...,"This is a must have lens... I originally bought this lens because I wanted to shoot more portrait style pictures of friends and family. But I quickly discovered it's a great lens for shooting just about anything. Especially useful for artfully making the ""bland"" in life look beautiful. I was originally looking at the f1.8 but decided to spend the extra money and get the f1.4, and i'm glad I did. The build quality is solid... It's fast and quiet, a world of a difference compared to my Sigma 18-200mm (in speed and noise that is). Discover what your SLR is really capable of and get this lens..."
5,excellent,it is will be perfect if it is with international guaranteeBECAUSE I AM NOT FROM USAthank :)
3,EF 50 1.4,"I bought this lens as an upgrade for the 50mm 1.8. I like the 1.8, but was disapointed by the build quality. I assumed the 1.4 would be like the 85 1.8, but it was not. Picture qualit is good and I have no issues with the pictures I get out of this lensThe AF motor is not true USM which makes everything a bit wobbly. The lens does extend when focussing. A solid and robust build is one of the things I like about primes and I do not find it here."
5,Nifty fifty for serious people,"Hello,I had the nifty fifty (50mm F1.8) for a long time, didn't really get a reason to upgrade until one day, on impulse just got this ... don't regret it for a second.This this is awesome, it's focuses way better, faster.I has great quality, great colors and really really pretty bokeh (after all that's what you get this for).Highly recommended ... just get it, it'll put a smile on your face.Cheers."
5,Fantastic piece of glass,"I was eyeballing this lens for about a year before I got my DSLR. I was hoping I was going to get it at the same time. I was fortunate enough to get my DSLR and then get this lens at the same time. The pictures I've taken with this lens are just fantastic and beautiful. Every time I get to go out and take pictures, I am amazed at the quality and how it just glistens with beauty. It has some weight to it, so it feels like great quality.When I go out and shoot with it, all of the other photographers swear by the lens. They always say that they would love to have this lens. Some of them have the 50mm f/1.2 and then they see mine and say, ""That is a fantastic lens. This one is great but, between the 2, they are basically the same, except the f/1.4 is $1,600 cheaper.""This lens is fantastic and cheap. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,I've only had this for a month or so...,"and I've only done about 2 sessions with it, but so far, I love it. It's very sharp (I'm a sharp freak) and fast, great in low-light (I only use natural light). The only thing is that it's insanely close-up with my 1.6 crop (I can't use it anywhere in my home except for maybe close-ups). So I'm on the hunt for a 35mm or wider (thinking of the Sigma 30mm), but I'm not giving my 50 up."
1,Read the One Star Reviews!!,"Absolutely a fantastic lens for the money - while it's working. Like many of the other one star reviews, this lens simply stopped working before it's time. I could not have been any happier and would have called this the best lens for the money - had it simply not stopped working. Mine was the same problem as everyone elses, the Auto Focus just stopped working - even the manual focus broke. I wouldn't risk it, but I must say before dying before its time, this camera is excellent indoors when shooting in natural light. I wanted to buy another, but decided to read all of the lower reviews before that decision. Turns out everyone has the same issue as mine."
4,Wonderful Lens,"This is a wonderful lens with great image quality, very fast, and very good build quality. No complaints."
2,50mm 1.8 lasted longer,This lens was amazing while it lasted. That AF/MF stopped working a month after I got it though. It's really unfortunate.
5,Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Lens,"Love this lens! Upgraded from the 50mm 1.8 and couldn't be happier in all aspects. From the durability, build and feel of this lens to the picture quality, this lens has been a great upgrade with no regrets!"
1,Don't buy this lens,"Like may others here, both automatic and manual focus stopped working for me soon after buying it (only lasted 4 months). If had read the other reviews before buying it, I would have skipped. Shame on Canon for selling a $300+ lens with such a short life expectancy."
1,This lens has major problem,I like this lens but recently I am having issue with auto focus. The lens cannot autofocus anymore. On further research I found that many buyers faced same problem but cannon has not done anything to resolve it. My suggestion is not to buy this lens. Here is more info on the issue : http://photo.net/canon-eos-digital-camera-forum/00R90I
4,Better build quality than the 50mm f1.8,"I am quite happy with this lens. It's reasonably sharp and lightweight. Build quality could be better, but the 50mm f1.4 is noticeably better built than the 50mm f1.8. The f1.4 has additional aperature blades over the 1.8, which gives more pleasing bokeh. On a 1.6x crop camera, this is a nice portrait lens.If it felt a little more solid, I would give it five stars, and Amazon won't let me give it 4.5."
5,Amazing lens,This is my number one lens - you can make some beautiful portrait photos with it! Highly recommend getting it.
5,great product,i love my lens!!! its a great starter for people who are exploring the lens world and product came very fast! thank you!
5,Love the lens.,"I was worried after reading many had some problems with the lens but prayed and I received a great lens. Now to just get use to using my body as the zoom.Took it out for a test drive yesterday, I am happy."
1,Disappointed,"Really wish I could rate this lens well, as I had heard great things and was very excited about it, but the autofocus was 2-3x slower than it should have been, new, right out of the box. I'm just glad I realized it and sent it back instead of using it for years as another unfortunate reviewer stated. After returning it, opted for the EF-S 60mm macro instead for various reasons. So as long as you don't receive a bad copy like I did, I'm sure you'll love the lens."
3,good while it lasted...,"I've truly loved this lens for 2.5 years. It's been beautiful. But this morning, the AF locked up on me during a photo shoot. I was so surprised, but now I read that it's a common problem -- I guess I'm lucky that it didn't happen sooner (although under warranty would've been nice)! Buyers should beware that it's likely to fail; you're basically paying for a disposable lens. I'm thinking that if the 1.8 lasts just one year, it'll be a better value. Not sure I'll be buying another 1.4 to replace this."
5,Stunning,"I'm fairly new to photography, but after playing with the kit lens for a while I learned its limitations - and wanted more! Looking around amazon this lens and the f1.8 50mm prime caught my eye. After some deliberation I decided that I would go all the way and get the f1.4. As I have never used the f1.8 I cannot do a comparison, but I will say I am thrilled with this lens. It makes it so easy to shoot beautiful, natural looking portraits and has great low-light performance. I am not disappointed going all the way for this lens, it will be part of my kit until the day it dies."
3,I had to return mine - a bad copy,"I received the lens yesterday. I spent a few hours testing and calibrating AF microadjustment on 5DMkII. It never gave me acceptable level of focus/sharpness at f4 or below. Throughout the whole aperture range, the images are much softer than my 24-105 f4L in side-by-side comparison. I did not like the color as much as any of the lenses I have. Overall, the images I get from this particular lens were disappointing.I believe I received a bad copy, because a prime lens cannot be this bad and I have seen very nice results by other reviewers. I wanted to exchange with another copy but Amazon did not gave me the option as the product was ""being reviewed"" and temporarily unavailable at Amazon. I do not know what it means, but it makes me wonder. I give a 3-stars (neutral) as I believe I received a bad copy and the return process has been easy so far. If I were to evaluate the particular copy I received, I would have to give a 1-star."
4,Great upgrade from the 50 1.8 II,"I recently upgraded from the 50 1.8 Mark II to the 50 1.4. I find this lens to have a nicer rendering when used wide open, smoother bokeh, and I like the build better (though its no L quality lens). It works well on both my 5D Mark II and my T3i. Definitely a worthwhile upgrade."
2,Disappointment,"When this lens first arrived, I was more than pleased with the results. Even with a fixed focal length it became my go to lens for almost every situation. Within a few weeks of arrival I shot an entire session using f/1.8, and every image came out clear and crisp. After taking only a few thousand pictures over about 2 months, the quality quickly started to deteriorate. Now I am completely unable to focus (in auto or manual) under around f/2.8 or so, and even higher for subjects more than a few feet away. I'm hoping I just got a lemon, but i've seen other reviews showing this problem, although after more use. Will be sending to Canon, hopefully they can repair the problem."
4,"A good len, mainly for closeup shots","I've been using this lens pretty often in the past couple of weeks.At first I wanted to send it back, but changed my mind after I figure out the limitations.The 50mm is great for closeup! No doubt about it! The pictures are very vivid, and the 1.4 provides a beautiful DOF.The problem that I stumbled upon was a very unsharp results when hand-holding the camera and shooting in wide open F stop and in low light area.I assumed that having the f on 1.4 will compensate my shaken hands... I was wrong...It turned out that these shots have to be taken on a tripod to get the sharpness that I was looking for.You can live without a tripod as long as you are shooting closeups, but once you want to shoot farther then a few feet, you will probably need a stable platform to get sharp shots.Conclusion... Good len, if you can live with the limitations."
4,Excellent Lens Quality -- but the wrong lens for me,"This is an incredible lens, delivering consistently great photos. Auto focus is fast and accurate. Of course, the bottom line is what kind of image quality will it dish up -- sharp, crisp, brilliant, excellent. People look at the pix I shoot with this lens and say, man, this looks professional. The only problem is, I can never back up far enough to get the right shot with this lens. Inside the house, crops are always too close. Walking down the street, if I want to take a photo of a nice house, I have to stand all the way across the street to get the whole house in the frame. I'm using a Canon D20 with the 1.6; that means this lens is a 70 mm or more. The 1.4 is great for natural light photos indoors, but it's kind of hard to make a semi-telephoto lens work for a birthday party or what have you. After a year with this excellent and beautiful lens, I'm now looking at 35 and 30 mm alternatives, because I can't make a 70 mm work for my needs."
3,Good Lens for low level lighting,"I take photos of Indoor Volleyball...a very fast paced sport with notoriously poor lighting. When I am allowed to roam around this lens works well when I can't I need a zoom but here is why I am really writing this review........The autofocus ceased after a few weeks time. Amazon sent me to Adorama who sent me to Canon. Canon did not reply back but they did send me an email of a survey about their customer service!Amazon helped me file an ""A - Z Claim"" which without informing me they denied. In all this time I have been waiting for a response the warranty expired. After another email pleading Amazon what I should do next they sent me to Adorama who in turn sent me to Canon who of course......did not reply back.All part of Life's rich paegeant I guess.Anyone want to buy a slightly used EF f1.4 50 mm? Manual focus works well!"
2,Stopped focusing after 1 year,"I originally rated this as a good lens, but it just stopped focusing on auto after a year of using it. Really disappointed. It served me well until now but will never buy it again because it is obviously poorly made. I've had my 24-70mm for several years without any problems."
5,Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM,"Excellent lens for a decent price. The optics and the picture quality are superb, you can instantly tell the difference between this and the stock lens you get in beginner packages."
5,Great lens,"This was the perfect answer to my son's photography interests. He took a class and got some great information about the right lens for his needs. This one was suggested and it met his needs perfectly. It is of excellent quality. Great product, great price."
4,awesome lens,"Some of the most beautiful pictures I have taken in a long time. The only thing that I am disappointed about is that I waited this long,"
3,Nice price for a 1.4 but a fragile lens.,This is a very reasonable price for a 1.4.......but you must baby this lens....If you attempt to manual focus it while in af mode you will damage this lens...And you will need to manual focus frequently when shooting in very low light which is the point of this lens.....That being said if you can avoid manual focusing of the lens while in af mode its a nice lens for the price. This lens is just particularly sensitive to that problem....
3,Great but fragile!,"I loved this lens but it broke. The AF stopped working. I was very happy with the quality of this lens so far, but the fact that it lasted only a couples of years really annoys me."
3,Maybe I got a bad copy,"I ordered on Amazon on 10/30/2006. Reading so many good reviews, I'd at least expect it to perform at the same level as 85mm f/1.8 lens. However, the color does not look as natural as the 85mm lens, exactly same camera, lighting, object, etc... Even had two people trying it. The major problem is AF. Subjects are easily out of focus with this lens, which does not happen often on the 85mm one. Of course, I have other friends who use the same type of lens claim it's fine. So I sent mine in for repair already. Hopefully the lens is still good, just my luck that I got a bad copy. It's still annoying because I will have to live without it for 2 weeks. If your house is big enough, I'd say go for the 85mm f/1.8 lens instead."
1,Never again...,"I bought it in 2002 and used it several times andkept it stored in a bag in a dry and cool place.It was well taken care of.In 2009 the AF just stopped working.It would not have surprised me if I had owned and if the AF would have diedon the Canon 50mm 1.8 lens...but on the Canon 50mm 1.4?I Donated it.I now use manual focus 50mm 1.4 lenses.I will never again pay so much for a Canon 50mm lens of any kind. It's notdurable and it's not reliable.The Canon 28-135mm did the same thing.Two very expensive lenses.One by one as they die on me, I'll be replacing my Canon equipment with something morereliable."
2,Soft focus & it Quit working,"I bought the Canon 50mm f/1.4 lens about 3 years ago. It was OK and did a descent job of capturing low light images (small clubs/concerts) but it has lost its ability to focus. If I auto focus, I have to back far away from my subject for it to lock on and if I switch to manual focus, the focusing ring just spins and does nothing. I have not dropped or handled this lens roughly, it just seems to have give out and quit working. Even when it did work, it was never tack sharp but I shoot with all L lenses so I know this isn't a fair comparison but I have seen other images this lens produces and mine never seem to compare. So I must have bought a soft copy along with being poorly built. I am being generous giving it 2 stars. I dont think I will replace this lens and I cant see paying $1500 for the f1.2 L version either although I would to have it."
4,Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM Lens,Guess most people know how good this lens is. The only cons I see -1. hunts a bit in low light to achieve focus.2. The manual focus ring is kinda rough - but this is in comparison with some of my other lenses - a coupla L lenses and the EF 100mm f/2.8 - all of them have a smoother focus ring.But the images make up for these shortcomings. Overall - I think a good buy.
5,Beautiful shots,"I'm not a professional by any means, but I do love photography. I bought this lens after lots of consideration because of its qualities as a good macro lens and potential portrait lens.This lens is so much more. Because of the relatively short distance necessary to create close shots, there is a sense of intimacy created in my photographs that has surprised me far beyond my original expectations.Portraits do have the tendency to be fairly ""in your face"", depending on the lighting, and again, depending on the lighting, the skin of your subject's may be a little too ""hi-def"", but I just attribute this to the macro-quality of the lens. Overall I have been really pleased.The lens does tend to hunt a bit depending on the light, from my experience, but re-positioning of your own body fixes that.I have this lens on my Canon K2-- a 35mm camera, and used in combination with different types of films, the results can be spectacular.Great buy!"
4,It works,"Purchased it from Amazon last Summer to shoot indoors without flash. It works under most conditions. In really low light, the focus may get slower."
4,good except shot at 1.4,"sharp, good color & contrast, especially at aperture f2.0 or above. It is soft at f1.4. It is OK with 4x6 prints, but the softness will be obvious with 8x10 prints. Stopped down to f1.8 or smaller, it is sweet."
2,Some one has to be different.,"Nice, sharp, bright, fast. But the darned thing focuses slightly in front of the subject.I was using the AF to get close and then switching to manual focus to fine tune, but then I decided, hey, why am I doing this for $360? Its not my imagination. I ran a test with a tripod and three focus cards on sticks. Very disappointed.I assume you can adjust it, but that should be the manufacturer's job.Thanks be to Amazon, they accepted a return at less than 30 days and gave me a refund.Canon should hire Amazon's Customer Service Manager. You have to like Amazon. Canon Customer Tech Support actually told me that I had to be wrong. Blame the victim.Amazon is, I think, the best customer service and support organization out there.BTW, I now have my second Tamron lens. Top quality performance and a six (6) year warranty. With Piezo drive their technology is ahead of the prime manufacturers."
5,The lens that got me hooked on photography,"I bought this lens over 2 years ago... it was the lens which hooked me on photography and started a very long, expensive road of purchasing lenses that cost more than some cars I've owned.But not this lens... reasonably priced, and it has earned its spot next to the other lenses in the collection that cost 3 to 8 times more. The build quality can't compete with any of the L-series lenses, but the images that it can produce definitely give them a run for their money.Just had to pay respect to the lens that started it all for me, even though it's now over 2 years after the fact."
4,"Pretty solid lens, but leaves me asking for more","Like the title says, this is a pretty solid lens, but it underperforms in certain situations. In daylight, it's super sharp at f/2.2 and up. From f/1.4-2.0, its decent. Theres lots of bokeh in this range, but edges tend to be a little softer. Thanks to the micro USM, focusing is extremely quiet, but in lower light situations, you may find yourself getting VERY frustrated in waiting for the autofocus to get a clear picture. It gets so bad sometimes, that I just resort to using the manual focus ring. Other than that, I have no complaints with this lens. Image quality with this lens is great. Excellent color and contrast in most of my pictures. The lens is well built, and you don't have to worry about any of the parts breaking off. I would definitely recommend this lens to anyone considering to get it."
5,outstanding,"Im very satisfied with this lense,very sharp photos, we need to be a litle closer to subject, works great in low light conditions, and also is one of the top lenses."
5,Love this Lens,This lens is amazing! If you are looking for a lens for low light situations then this is the one...Canon makes a great product at a great price.
1,Poor quality,"Very poor quality. It died on me twice, each time on an exotic trip - horribly disappointing! Both auto and manual focus stopped functioning. Canon fixed it for free the first time, the second time it was no longer covered by warranty. I probably took just 300-400 shots with it total! It appears that a lot of Canon products - unless you buy the most expensive ones - are having quality problems. (My lens was made in Japan, BTW). The Toyota syndrome? Would like to buy it again, hoping that I may be be lucky this time - but do I want to risk spending over $300 just to see it die somewhere in Burma or Borneo while getting ready for one of those on-my-god shots, which is exactly what happened to me TWICE?"
3,I probably got a bad copy of this lens,"The auto focus is not accurate. All my raw pictures came out too dark. I expected this lens to outperform it's cheaper version: canon 50mm/1.8, but it is not so."
5,Celestial Lens,"The first time I used this lens was on a wedding shoot. I read some in-the-mouth advice somewhere that said every photographer needs a 50mm prime lens to be happy. So I thought to myself ""I'm every photographer!"" And plopped down the $300+ for this.I was beginning to regret the decision until I used this puppy.Pictures so crisp and clear and beautiful came out of my camera that day. Pictures that need no sharpening, no photoshopping, no curves adjustments or contrast adjustments. Just honest to goodness dead sexy clar pictures.I was so happy with the pictures that I composed a poem about this lens on the spot! It goes:Oh I think that I shall never seea lens so ripe with clarityThen the 50mm which sits abreastUpon my camera's lovely chest.I now don't mind 'walking around' more, or ditching a zoom lens. This lens is Empyrean."
5,"great lens, great price","i was preparing to buy the L series lens for 3-5 times as much when a friend who owns both advised me to get this one. i have been using it every day and it has become my standard lens. the autofocus can be slow, and you need to make sure, at the f/1.4 setting, that you have your focus correct, because the depth of field is so thin, but with a little practice this creates the most amazing images. i have done portraits with it and my sitters all cannot believe how great the final product is. i strongly recommend this product."
4,Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Telephoto Lens,Good value for the price. Have not used it much so I have yet to see how it holds up.
3,Auto focus broke after 3 months,"The lens itself provides beautiful photos, but the auto focus is not rugged at all since it broke after 3 months of very gentle use. My camera bag fell from 1 foot high (completely closed and padded), and all of my other lenses were just fine. This one, however, would never work again.I can't recommend it until they bring it up to the same rugged standards as their other lenses"
3,"Great shots, just not as durable as I thought","The main reason I chose the f/1.4 over the f/1.8 was because of the more solid build. I hate the feel of cheap, plasticky lenses so opted to pay a couple hundred extra dollars for something heavy duty.I had it for about one month before I dropped it less than 3 feet to the ground. It landed on soft, almost shag-like carpet so I thought it wasn't a big deal. I turned it on and it no longer would auto or manual focus. When I give it a shake, you can hear tiny little broken pieces moving around. It really was as soft as a drop could be and do not see how it could have messed it up that badly, but it did.It took amazing pictures and would be a great lens for someone who was not such a klutz. That's just not me I guess."
3,Awesome BOKEH of a Lens.....,"Lens has AWESOME BOKEH. Thats the only reason you will need to buy this lens?But if you need more convincing it has a fast aperture of 1.4, great for low light. Build quality better than the canon ef 50 1.8. Image quality I feel like its better than the canon ef 50 1.8. Definitely more consistent focusing than the canon ef 50 1.8, Fast auto focus. Sharp at 1.4. Even sharper when stepped down to about 2.8.Only thing wrong with this lens is that front barrel of the lens zooms in and out (similarly to the 50 1.8) while it is focusing. I REALY DISLIKE THAT. lol."
2,not what I expected,"First of all I am not a professional photographer but I took thousands of pictures over the last past years.I bought this lense especially for low light situations where you don't want to use a flash.Well, that said the lense arraived yesterday and I took my time to get familiar with it.I think its a good lense but its just not working for me and my Canon D60.In every light situation whenever I want to use the aperture fully open the pictures are not in focus.This only gets better around F2.5 and above... well, for this I didn't buy it.This lense is on its way back...I will upload some test pictures for you to compare.Next thing I will try out the cheaper F1.8 version."
5,Great pictures,"I really love this lens, excellent portraits in- and outdoors. The lens is light but still feels much compact and robust than the f/1.8."
2,Nothing but issues....,This lens has been problematic since I got it. I wish I had returned it right away. First it would not lock focus then I took it in and they fixed it. Now it is causing some sort of ghosting on the bokeh. Looks awful when subjects are placed on dark b/g. I am so annoyed cuz now I have to bring it back iN AGAIN. When it is working the photos are amazing.
4,professional quality lens for reasonable price,"Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR CamerasI love this lens. There are only a few lenses under $1,000.00 that are available for the digital canons and also capable of really top quality performance. This is one of them and a big step up from the standard zoom that came with my Rebel XT. It is exciting to be able to shoot in low light conditions again (I had a F 1.2 lens for my old AE-1 film camera). I even shot some great stuff at night.The focal length is a very useful one and I LOVE the bokeh but sometimes the short focal plane is a little too confining. For detail shots you have to switch to manual settings and stop it down to get enough depth of field to keep your subject all in focus."
4,Great in low light.,As a wildlife and outdoor photographer I needed a high speed lens capable of taking pictures in the early mornings and late evenings. The Canon EF 50mm f1.4 gave me an addition 45 to 60 minutes shooting time over my other f2.8 lens. The pictures of hunters during the early and late hours of the hunt are clear and sharp. The auto focus time is slightly longer than some of my prime lens but adequate thus the reason for 4 stars. It works very well indoors too without flash.
1,"Nice photos, but horrible build quality and failure prone","Well, when it works, it takes nice shots. The large aperture makes for some pretty good bokeh for the price. However, most copies will not accurately focus throughout a range of distances (for example, mine was spot on until the subject got about 6 feet away, then it was extremely inaccurate from there to infinity). The autofocus mechanism is also failure prone and if it happens out of warranty (it WILL happen) it costs about half the value of the lens to have it fixed. You can sort of protect against the AF failure by storing the lens with the hood attached, but my copy failed while using this method. I'd go with the cheaper f/1.8, or the slightly more expensive Sigma 50mm f/1.4 if I had to do it again. Simply not worth the trouble and I've gone through three copies of this thing. All were not acceptable."
2,canon 50mm 1.4,this lens was ordered as new but came with a LOT of dust inside on the elemenst. Also was slow to focus.
4,Amazing lens,This lens is great. I've been doing portraits and just random snapshots and it makes every picture beautiful! The only downside is the lack of ability to zoom. Other than that it's a great lens!
2,Great lens - arrived broken,I needed to replace my originally 50mm 1.4 because it was dropped accidently by someone over the weekend. I ordered a new one and it arrived broken. The lens box was NOT protected at all in the shipping box from Amazon. It had some bubble paper on only one side. The lens was rattling inside when I opened it. Gave it a quick test run and photos were blurry and AF struggled to lock. I put my 580ex speedlite on and the shots were still not tack sharp. Hoping the replacement lens they are sending arrives in NEW and WORKING condition. The lens arrived without a packing slip too which is odd for Amazon.
5,Fantastic lens,"The Canon EF 50mm F/1.4 is a fantastic lens! I love using it when shooting products, though I don't like using it for portraits, I prefer my 85mm f/1.2 to do that job, but overall this is a great lens and it's every photographers favorite and worth owning."
1,A $500 (or more) lens,"I paid $360 for this lens and for a year and a half I had no regrets whatsoever. The images are sharp and clean with no CA or distortion of any kind really. What sucks is that after a year and half the AF motor has given up, and now Canon wants another $150 to repair the defective lens. I suppose if you used this lens mostly for portraits this wouldn't be a huge concern because you could always focus manually. I, however, used it for street photography, so by the time I would finish accurately focusing my shot is long gone."
4,Good for the price - but beware soft pictures,"I've had this for 6 months now and for the price it can't be beat - this one or the 1.8 are awesome for people who can't afford ""L"" lenses.However, it is sometimes slow to focus & focuses and then un focuses itself. Sometimes you can't wait for it to get it right. I just used it for a shoot and I was annoyed at the number of soft images I had to toss.It does create stunning images but I tell people to get the 1.8 - it's the same build & blur for a fraction of the price."
4,Great Lens,"At 1.4 this lens is really tricky to get the plane of focus right where you want it. It's helped me learn to move around my subjects more instead of relying on my zoom to get in and out. It's more expensive than the $79 2.0 50mm, but it's a lot more solid and should last a long time."
5,Got a good copy,"Got a really nice copy. at f/1.4, it is still sharp unlike the others I've seen which is soft. I am happy I got this over the 50mm 1.8. The body of the 1.4 is really well built. Nice solid feeling. I debated on getting this or the 1.8, and decided to get the 1.4 based on its built. Its 3x more, but I think its worthed it. Read too many reviews on the 1.8, the lens just breaks apart after a few use. I picked up a lens hood to protect and reduce flare."
1,"Under a year, and it is broken","Skip the heartbreak and don't buy. This lens' manual and auto focus stopped working after a couple months of use. No falls, no bumps, nothing."
4,Amazing lens,I purchased this lens via B&H since they had a much better price at the time ($399 -$100 instant savings plus no tax and free shipping). Total price to the dorr $299. I had previously purchased the f1.8 versin of this lens and wasn't really impressed. This lens and its sister lens are definitely not cut from the same cloth. The f1.4 lens is crystal clear and works well for low light shots as seen in the picture I uploaded of my dog staring at the Christmas tree. All lights in the house were off -only the tree lights were on. This lens produces great bokeh effortlessly. Any professional or amateur photographer should have this lens in their kit!
5,This lens is great!,"This lens has been one of my go to walk around lenses for quite a while not since I had first bought it. The bokeh at f/1.4 is amazing. I have yet to try this with my 5D Mark III. But the lens is simply amazing on a camera like the Canon Rebel T2i (550D).This lens is very fun, and very fast. The pictures are very sharp."
2,"Great lens, but unreliable AF","Like many have said, the Canon 50/1.4 is a fantastic lens, a great bargain. But like many others have also said, the autofocus loves to break, rendering it a manual focus-only piece of glass. Mine's not broken all the time - not even most of the time - but when it does refuse to work, it seems to do it at the most inopportune times. If all you're doing is taking pictures of the kids, go for it - just remember to always rest it on its back, never with the glass facing down. That's how it gets injured, or so they say. But if you need it for weddings or other blink-and-you-miss-it events, you can't trust it.It's a 5 star lens if they ever fix this issue, but until then it only gets two."
4,Great Pictures,"This lens is made with quality, and produces great pictures with my Canon 40D. Great Portrait photographs, with a professional look. I would definitely recommend this lens to anyone looking to not spend a ton of money on a lens. You cannot beat Canon lenses."
5,Worth Every Penny,"I've owned this lens for a couple of months now and this is by far my favorite lens for low light and portraiture. The images I get with 50mmm 1.4 are by far the sharpest of any lens I've ever used and the bokeh (background blur) is beautifully smooth. The construction is also solid, lightweight and VERY quiet.Working in a theater, I often get the chance to sit in the front row for shows and take shots of my friends... The colors that this lens picks up from theater lights are simply unbelievable. As so many others have written, If you are debating between the 1.4 and the ""el cheapo"" $80 1.8, do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks on the 1.4. I guarantee you will be happy you did so and, like me, you'll probably smile a little every time you put this lens on your camera."
5,Lens,This is still the one lens I use the most. Works perfectly and I just Love it so much. This is a definite lens that should be in everyone's collection. The 1.4 is just amazing and the depth of field.
3,Serious AF problems,"This is definitely a great potrait lens but thats only till the AF starts malfunctioning. Its surprising that Canon has not yet fixed this problem considering that its cheaper version the 50 f1.8 never really had problems with the AF. IF you are lucky enough, your piece might just last for more than a year. If i were a millionare, i would definitely buy this lens and never worry about it stop functioning"
5,Great lens for photographers,"I started out cheap with the Canon 50mm f1.8 lens. It is fine for basic shots in average conditions but falls short in contrast and sharpness compared to my zoom lenses. That lead me to get the Canon 50mm f1.4 lens. Wow! Sharpness is fantastic. The crispness, color and detail are unsurpassed with this lens. I am very pleased with this lens and wish I had just spent the money for it to start with. I also found this lens focuses faster than the f1.8 lens. I am using it on my Canon EOS30d."
5,A leading highly readable book on poverty in America,"This book is extremely readable. It lays out the story of poverty in America; the programs, policies and legislation that were created to address it; and the social, political and cultural issues surrounding it all. The guy writes very, very well, and it is enjoyable. I did buy it for school at the University of Chicago, but anyone with an interest in this subject would enjoy it."
4,"Trim kit is looking and functional, but not crazy about the shower head.","Shower head holds a lot of water after use, and it drips for a long time. It has no hand-held shower head either."
3,Land of Evening,This book contains poetry that is generally about aging and how the aging see themselves. For that reason I gave the book a 3 becuase one has to be aging to understand the book. The book most likely will not appeal to younger individuals. The author is a French man and writes in a way that is transcultural. That part I did enjoy. Thank you.
2,INCOMPLETE ITEM DESCRIPTION,"I was under the impression that I was buying a dual McFarlane pack of the regular 6"" figurines, not the 3"" ones. Somebody's got to change that item description. I was extremely dissapointed upon this package's arrival."
5,Essential,"This book has managed to live on, which is perhaps unfortunate - historically speaking, it's far more relevant to contemporary geopolitics than it should be.In any case, SIDESHOW has managed to stand as one of the better books on Cambodia, and America's involvement in Cambodia (Elizabeth Becker's WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER is a must-read as well). One could debate Shawcross' perspectives, but his research is meticulous and has withstood many attacks, and his depiction of the machiavellian darkness that can creep into foreign policy is chilling and ruthless, and - for better of worse - makes for hypnotic reading, all the more frightening as it's drawn straight from history, research, the Freedom of Information act.Now more than ever, this is essential reading.-David Alston"
2,I am not sure that this is good book..,"I just want to mention that defensive check is not shown good, as a 10 year handball player I could say that."
4,Very good but could be better...,"I like Jerry Rivera's music a lot and I love all these videos. The only thing missing is the song named as this album ""Amores como el nuestro"" which the sticker inside the packaging says it was included but it is not, kinda odd."
2,What to do on Long Island,The book listed many places and sights and places on the island but was short on just what the places consisted of. I expected the book to suggest some itineraries of interesting jaunts about the island. It was not very helpful to me.
1,worst book ever,Do NOT waste your money on this book. I'm glad I checked it out from the library first. This was my first and last Connie Mason book. I am an avid reader...I have over 2000 books in my private little library so I like to think I know a bit about a good read. This isn't one. The characters were shallow...Jess was a pig headed idiot...the first love scene was little more than rape. Just a bad bad book. I managed to read to page 120 when I just gave up and threw the book down. Obviously I won't be finishing it.
4,A devilishly good book!,"I am a horror novel fan and this one was very good. While it lacked the depth of a Koontz or King novel the story moved along very well, with no unnecessary sub plots. The story takes place in Southern California in an area know as ""Apple Hill"", where bakery and pie shops sell homebaked apple goodies. This was quite amusing to me as I go to Apple Hill in Northern California every fall. After reading the book I will never look at an apple orchard or a mincemeat pie in quite the same way. This is really a great book to sit down with and realx with. I will be on the lookout for more of Ms. Thorne's books."
1,Not Worth the Candle,"I love horror and mystery stories, but this one was tedious and predictable from start to finish. The descriptions were stock footage and the climax was evident far too soon. Too bad it wasn't nearly as interesting as the picture on the paperback cover."
5,moonfall,An excellent read!! A thrilling roller coaster ride. It will make you want the light on at night!!
4,Great Book!,"I love Tamara's books, I cannot put them down! This one is not as scary as 'Haunted', but it still keeps you turning those pages! ""Moonfall"" has a couple of slow spots but once you turn the page, you are hooked again. Tamara's books always add a bit of the erotic to her stories that just adds to the horror. TAMARA, GIVE US MORE! I love her books, the are scary from the first page and just increase from there."
5,Tamara Thorne is an excellent horror writer.,I would like to see something new from her. Still reading Moonfall but her Haunted book was exceptional (plus 2 more words for amazons review)
3,Very Scary,"This was a good horror novel with depth. There is plenty of back story, which is explained, fiendish baddies you love to hate, and good guys that take a number of punches but still manage to win.There are some very strong violence and violent sexual scenes - rape does appear in this story. I would NOT recommend this to a young adult.The only other horror I've read is Stephen King. This is not quite on his level, but is a good, chilling, Halloween-prep reading, nonetheless.(*)>"
3,chrome not the best choice for the palmV,"If functionality was everything this stylus would get a higher rating. I got this stylus on the strength of the first review, but the bright(!) silver styling contrasts poorly with the matte surface of my Vx. if aesthetics are important to you, you may want to wait for a matte version. Another product, the Palm combo stylus/inkpen has its faults but it has a great matte surface and looks terrific flush against the Vx.this stylus sticks out like a chrome thumb."
2,There are better ones,The major problem with this unit is that the top is always a little bit loose and needs to be tightened once in a while.Bottom Line: Not really necessary to dig into your pocket to buy this one. It's about the same as the original stylus came with the palm unit.
2,Useless if you're intelligent or non-traditional,"This book has incredible insights like ""manage your time effectively"" and ""choose a quiet place to study."" Also it's totally aimed at people who knew at the age of 15 that they wanted to be doctors. It has nothing to say to vaguely non-traditional students -- people who are coming to medicine after being out of college a few years, or not being science majors, or even just in their last few years of college."
4,It was an over good book,"I thought it was a decent book, it offers alot of the basic information that someone would need to know when applying. I was looking for some more ""insider secrets"", but it really didn't have a ton of them."
5,Great information source for to-be medical students!,Great book! Full of information worth knowing if you really want to go to a medical school.
1,Worst wiper blades,"Anco used to be the gold standard for wiper blades. I bought these a while back, put them on my Highlander - lasted one week. Not going to buy this online again."
1,Do not buy Anco,I bought anco wipers for my nissan sentra. It worked ok for couple of months and now it chatters a lot. It even does not clean the windshield.
4,Good replacement blades.,"These blades are good, but not as good as Triple Edge, which is what my husband prefers to have. These will stay stored away to be used as short notice replacements."
1,The reviews are right.,"Very poor product, noisy in use and bounce along, a waste of money.I know why they are so cheap, GARBAGE !!!"
1,Broke after 6 months,"Very disappointed in these wipers. The rubber stripping fell off and was scratching my windshield after 6 months of light usage. I live in Northern California, so it was rarely used all summer and fall. As soon as I start to use it, it fell apart. Junk!"
1,wipers did not function properly,"the windshield wipers did not work.my mechanic said they were inferior and installed another brand.he threw away old wipers anco that i purchase from amazon,so iwas unable to return for credit.one of your employee's said they would credit my acct. for20.00 but did not do so. leonard ranta"
2,No adapter for Tahoe,"Seemed straight forward to order this, but there was simply no way to attach this wiper blade to my 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe. There was a plastic adapter piece needed and not included. I should have simply gone to the auto parts store and gotten the blades and I would have saved a lot of time. Now I have to go anyhow and I have to do the return hassle. Amazon does not know how to accurately tell you which wiper blades fit which cars."
2,Streaks out of the box,"I bought this wiper and a Ford Motorcraft wiper at the same time for a comparison on my two cars. The Anco wipers are not worth the cheap price they charge you, they are very poor out of the box . The old wipers I replaced did a better job and they were separating. These wipers streak the windshield and are noisy as soon as you put them on. Not worth the time it takes to swap them and maybe you might do better with used wipers. The Motorcraft wipers I bought as a comparison are smooth like butter with a very clean windshield as a result. Not sure what consumers reports was evaluating but this wiper was poor for both the passenger and the drivers side. Not sure I have ever bought a wiper that was worse.Be warned"
