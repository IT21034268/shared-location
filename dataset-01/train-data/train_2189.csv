5,i'll be back,"terminator what better way to get it ,then in a box set . so you don't miss any of the good stuff . thank you."
4,Summer Breeze,"This is good a S and C disc (ha,one of the 2 disc available!) but I feel that there are 3 better recordings not available. Maybe if record companies read these things they'd make more money. Seals and Crofts were important to millions of people and those people are buying lots of CDs today."
4,Classic record in the field of softrock- Westcoast style,"If You like bands/artists such as early Eagles,Bread, Poco, Jackson Browne, here is something to try. The record shows fine singing and playing spiced with tasteful orchestrations. The only things that made me feel a bit uneasy were couple of lyrics that, however, are honestly made and performed. The overall feeling on the record is relaxed yet sharp to carry on the songs with ease."
4,Soft as Summer,"Seals & Crofts' Summer Breeze is a soft and easy album with excellent harmonies and folky grooves. The title track is a classic piece of music with vivid lyrics and sweet harmonies. ""Hummingbird"" has a strong chorus and ""The Euphrates"" and """"East Of Ginger Trees"" have some deep lyrics. Summer Breeze perfectly encapsules the folk-rock sound of the early 70's."
1,"very good, but...",this is a very enjoyable cd but Year Of Sunday has always been my favorite seals & crofts album and i would love to see it released on cd. is anyone listening?
4,"Globe Trekker: Earth Journeys, Vol. 1","Excellent music, but this contains the same material as disc-1 of the 2-cd set Lonely Planet Vol-2. Please see those reviews."
5,CHANGING OIL THE EASY WAY,Works very well. I change oil on mt CLK-500 from under the hood. No jacking the car up and getting underneath(NO drain plug on oil pan). Filter on top of the motor. Inserted tube down oil fill tube and extracted 7.5 litre's of oil in 15 min.
5,Mityvac 7201 Fluid Evacuator,"The product performed just as described. After yeasr of approaching oil removal from an engine that does not have an easy oil pan drain pug access, I decided to spend a few bucks and purchase something that would always do the job. It has functioned very well and I am pleased with my purchasesummer 2012"
1,"Horrible customer service, horrible quality control","If it works, it works pretty good. Chances are you will get one with a missing O ring though. Several people on car forums I am a member of receive defective items including myself. I called customer service after multiple emails went unanswered. I told them I think it was missing an o ring because it would not hold a vaccum. They said ""yep it might be"" and that was it, no ""we will get one right out to you"" or ship it back for an exchange. They were very rude. I just sealed it with some gasket maker and it works now but looks terrible. I would go with a different unit with beter quality control."
3,Good concept,"This device is commonly used to change oil in Mercedes. It does not, however, work on all makes and models. I have a 2002 explorer that apparently has a screen prohibiting the evacuator from reaching the oil pan. It would be nice if the description would include a list of vehicles that the device would work on."
1,"Pumping function broken out of the box, Evacuates great","Evacuation function works great. Unfortunately I was unable to try the product out until it was past the amazon return period. The pumping function is broken as others have reported. Return of this for the manufacturers warranty seems not worth the effort. I am sure I am not making an operational mistake, since the reversing valve is a simple function."
3,Mityvac 7201,This pump was difficult to make work properly and when it did the time to empty my oil pan was longer than I wanted to be. About 45 to 50 minutes to suck out 7 quarts. The top is very picky about sealing properly - don't tighten too much or it won't seal at all. Overall the price from Amazon was great the pump just left a little to be desired.
1,wouldn't hold vacuum pressure,"Bought based on good reviews. This would not hold vacuum pressure, I had to constantly pump to extract the oil. By constantly, I mean not the 5-10 times the directions say, but rather hundreds of pumps. I would rather have bought the 12volt pump for much cheaper. I returned this item."
3,Mixed review,"I haven't really used it yet for the reason intended, changing the oil in my jet ski. So, I can't comment on how well it works. The main reason for this review is to put it out there that it does not work with a 2000 Chevy Silverado. The siphon tube does not fit thru the bottom of the dip stick tube. It would be really nice if Mityvac had a published list of what vehicles it works with and what ones it does not. I have my fingers crossed that it'll work with my jet ski, otherwise there will be a new/(un)used Mityvac on *****'slist. Long story short, do your research to see if you can confirm or deny if it will work with your vehicle before you buy it."
1,Waste of money,"A great concept, but the container would not seal properly from its first use. A great deal of money gone to waste."
1,Tubing too big in diameter to fit in dipstick tube,"I am very disappointed. I have a 2002 Ford Explorer with the V-6 engine. The smallest tube supplied wouldn't fit in the dipstick tube. I still haven't been able to find a tube that will fit, so the pump is useless!!!"
1,Just don't even think about buying this ! Its junk !,"This little mousy vac doesn't work Period. I'm mechanically inclined and work on cars all of the time. Followed instructions, what little there are, and had read through many reviews before buying it.Its going right back in the box. Pumped at least 200 times, got maybe a quart.Run, dont walk away from this product."
1,Mityvac 7201 Fluid Evacuator Plus,I could not get enough vacuum to draw the oil from the crankcase... unit would not work. I am very dissatisfied with the product.
4,Works,Overall not bad. I used it to change the oil in my Mercedes took about 30 minutes to the job. Mine leaked around the pour spout while trying to pump the old oil into the bolltes (air not fluids). Easier to just poor the old oil out. BTW I did this all from a wheelchair. I'll be using it to change the power steering and brake fluids soon.
4,Works well,"A good product. I read many reviews,and good thing too as dthey are right. I did everything like yoou were supposed to do and nothing happened. I went inside to reread some reviews and ten minutes later I cam out to the garage and the mityvac was full of oil. So in the end it workded as advertised and was an easy job, a lot less work than jacking the car up, etc."
3,"Works great on German cars, not so much on Japanese cars.","When I bought this, I had an 03 Audi A4 and A 99 Honda Civic. I used it on the Audi and it worked great. It sucked all the oil out in a about an hour. When I used it on the Civic though, I could only get half the oil out (about 2 quarts from a 4 quart capacity engine). No matter how hard I tried pushing the tube down the dipstick hole, it would only keep sucking air. I had to empty the rest by unplugging the oil release nut at the bottom of the oil pan. May have something to do with the engine design."
4,Great oil change product,"Followed the advice of reviews here an other places:1) tighten all screws on receipt2) push the tube as far as it will go and then pull it back about 1/2""I used this to change the oil on a 2003 Mini Cooper and it worked great. No issues. Took a while to pull all the oil out and had to pump a few times, but very good overall experience."
1,Need some QA improvements.,"This is my second unit of Mityvac - used to have the 7300. Better then the 7300 because of the separate air pump, and the reversible flow.This particular unit did not hold the vacuum, so extracted out around 2L and then stopped. I could hear the fuzzing sound near one of the screws. Kept bumping and tighten the screws with no positive effect. Returned for a refund. I ended up with an unsuccessful oil check with 1/2 new and 1/2 remaining oil - wasted oil. Need better QA checks before getting these out for customers."
4,Fluid Evacuator,"Mityvac 7201 Fluid Evacuator PlusGood Product and very usefull for many areas, cars, and boats. Simplifies life and on boats remove water from hard to reach areas."
3,"Test your luck, may get a good unit, may not. 4 stars if it works","I have one of these and love it. Ordered a second from amazon for another house, went to use it 11 months later for the first time, and it won't pressurize. Amazon won't exchange - so I'm done ordering on amazon and with Prime. $70 wasted. could have exchanges locally, and considering what I spend here, would expect the same service.So four stars for this Mityvac 7201 if it works, a bit slow sometimes, and 0 stars for Amazon customer service on my first attempted return after spending thousands here."
3,why dont things work out of the box,"I purchased the Mitvac 7201 Fluid extractor. Out of the box the construction looks solid and it is. Based on another's review I tried it in the house trying to evacuate water from a 2 liter bottle, it took forever. Fortunately I heard a leak where the top cover gets connected to the main tube housing. I was able to tighten the screws on the lid and it worked rather quickly. It only takes a few pumps 5-10 to get all the oil out of my 13hp lawn mower engine. The reverse valve is part of the reason I purchased this model unfortunately pressurizing the system the air leak was much more prevalent. I will probably remove the top gasket and reassemble it with rtv silicon which I believe will fix the issue. There is a plug on the top of the unit that you can open to pour the contents out and that is the way I cleaned out the cylinder."
4,didn't start out well but it all worked out,"I can't get it to work. I read the directions and advice from these reviews and get about 8 inches of liquid into the tube and that's it.My entire weight is on the handle with feet off the ground and it won't budge anymore. I agree with "" Kevin D. Buickerood ""Kev in Dallas"" --have to pump and pump--something is definitely wrong. --what a waste of time!A few pictures in the directions might help.--------------------They did send me a new one. I had to get permission and an address to return the unusable one before the would send a workable one.Make sure the oil is warm, but not boiling before you try siphoning it - after you have done errands would work. I can get two-three oil changes done myself on one oil filter then I take it to my mechanic and he checks out my car's status. My car is an '89 Honda Prelude with 225,000 miles on the engineThis has saved me a lot of time and money. It just didn't start out very well."
2,Worked great for over a year- then imploded,"Bought from Snapon,worked great for a couple years..However, be ready for the deficiencies:1. Rubber stopper a bear to get out, even after lube.2. Tubing connections fiddly.3. Dispense/Extract valve sticks repeatedly.4. Final death occurred by implosion of the actual polyethelyne chamber. Just crumpled like a tin can. Made me jump about a meter, and got oil all over my driveway. Not like I used it more than a couple dozen times, in total, either. Just for oil changes at home.However, I may buy a replacement, as it works well if you can live with all the fiddly stuff, and that final scary crumple."
1,Missing Parts. Brand New In Box - Botched,"Overall can't comment on the functionality of the unit. But unfortunately as a Brand New In Box item it came without the 5 foot house, adapter et. Makes you worry about quality control. Dip stick accessory also missing. Thankful for Amazons quick, easy and free return and exchange policy. Lets see how the next one goes. Dr. Tasso Pappas"
1,never used,"I discovered that my new car does not have a dipstick, so I returned the product and as of today have not received credit."
4,High quality,"After one use, I can already say this is quality stuff. The only reason I don't give 5-stars is because I would've like volume measurements, graduated cylinder style, to know the amount of fluid extracted. I ended up measuring, pouring quarts, and marking them myself. No biggie."
5,World great,Better than expected. Easy to use. Seems well made. I'm pleased with this product. Would recommend it if you have a Mercedes.
3,"Works great, not sure of reliability","I bought this one to replace my 3 year old one. The old one worked fine, until the casing ""popped"" while evacuating oil from my car. I have used this on 4 different vehicles to remove oil, and it works great. But it should last longer than 3 years. Hopefully this one will be around for a long time."
5,Great product!!!!!,"I read the reviews about poor suction. Hogwash!! Before I bought the item I saw a guy use it on YouTube. There he tightened the top screw before his first use. So I did the same. I've already changed oil on 3 cars. Best of all, 2 of the cars had the oil filter on top of the engine. Hence no lifting and crawling underneath the car! I may never again go to my local Jiffy Lube for an oil change!"
3,"Works OK, but I think I have a vacuum leak",I don't think my Mityvac works as described...I had to pump my unit more than normal (meaning alot more than the guys on YouTube). I also hear a hissing noise when I pump....so I think there is an air leak.
5,Pump It Don't Dump It,"First jack or lift my car; then slide underneath my car followed by the good part...pulling the oil plug. After wiping the oil off my body....you know this story. The Mityvac is the best. Run your car till it reaches normal operating temperature; turn off your engine and remove the oil dipstick; insert the Mityvac evacuation tube in place of the oil dipstick;Pump the Mityvac 15 times (the instructions say 10) to build a vacume preasure and walk away for 10 to 15 minutes. Though I bought this a month ago I used it this weekend to do my first 2 oil changes. When you return the oil is neatly drawn into the Mityvac and you can now put the clean oil in your car. It's that simple. I used the Mityvac to then pump the dirty oil into the empty oil containers. My next 2 oil changes will pay for this device. Great device, very sturdy."
1,Bad Seal & Pump only worked ONCE!,"I received product on time and it worked great the first time I used it on my Merc C300. Yeah the seal is missing, but it still had suction so I continued to use it. Even reading about the possible flaws: Seal (missing), Pump failure, No suction and the ability of switching between suction and extraction, I went ahead and gave it a shot. HEY USE MY BAD EXPERIENCE AND LEARN FROM IT. DONT BUY THIS!!!!! FIND OTHER ALTERNATIVES!!. The Pump completely stopped working after first use. Purchased in Aug 2010; used Sept 2010 (1st time) and 2nd use Feb 2011 (wife's car). IT came apart from the inside of pump mechanism. If anyone one wants mine for parts, I'll send mine to you. WORTHLESS! I even did a YouTube Vid on how to use it once I got it. Haha I should make another on all of the things wrong with mine. Good luck if you decide not to head my warning."
3,I expected better results.. but it works.,"I saw a lot of guys using this on my BMW forum. When I rcvd it I was pleased at it's quality.. it's just plain cool. BUT, when using it, it's so slow. I needed to pump and pump to get it to work (maybe I was doing something wrong?) and it seemed to take AN ETERNITY TO PULL THE OIL OUT.It worked better on ourt Honda than it did on my BMW. It works, but don't expect to sit back and relax."
4,"It sucks, it blows, revel in it","Pump it, baby, pump it!!!!!! Then, let it blow!!!! or, move a valve and let it suck. Withdraw liquids or dispense them. The narrow tubing allows access to tight narrow spaces. Mine was made in Taiwan. Nowadays, unlike years past, I have observed an increase in quality of many Taiwan-made products.To assist in longevity I do not over-pump the critter. It IS made of plastic. The device seems to be solid enough for home use but abuse may be problematic and you don't want to drop it since plastic can crack.As others uttered within their reviews, the withdrawing/dispensing of fluids is an evolution requiring some patience since the size of the tubes limits the fluid flow.But, for the typical home use, the time spent waiting for fluid to flow allows time for pondering, to meditate, to achieve a Zen-like state wherein one's thoughts become clearer, more focused, perhaps even achieving fluid flow enlightenment.And that is a wonderful thing."
1,Had to manually pump out the oil,"Returned the first one as oil would stop evacuating once the pumping stopped.On the second one, there was a leak where the tube inserts into the mityvac as the connector ring came off. Grease or tape didn't fix the leak.On the whole, a very bad experience."
3,Works but tricky and slow,I had to retract me negative review because I finally figured out how to use it when I found a picture of someone using it in action and played around with it.Hopefully it'll work for you:1) Warm up the engine2) Stick the dipstick tube only as far as the length of the dipstick (by looking at the picture I release I had shoved my all the way in)3) Seal the rubber stopper contraption by the handle by latching it down(Manual did not mention this)4) Pump 10 times5) shove the dipstick down further once you have established suction to ensure it's all the way down the pan.It's slow to empty and keep an eye on it once in awhile. It may break suction like it did to me which required pumping again.I rate it 3/5 for the fact that the instruction sucks and it's slow to suction.
1,Bad Quality Control,"As many have noted, some of these ship without a required gasket/o-ring that is needed to keep the vacuum. I had hoped this was an issue worked out over the many months since the first complaint, but I just received mine and it was DOA out of the box. While the overall impression is that the tool is a good quality, it simply doesn't work. At the very least, if you order one, test it out right away. If you wait until you need it, you might be stuck with it."
4,Mityvac 7201 Success Story,"I'm very pleased not to have to crawl under my car anymore and pull the drain plug to empty the oil.The Mityvac works as advertised. Very refreshing in today's market place of ""have to have"" items.All you do is push the small extraction hose down the oil dipstick tube and pump the siphon handle about ten times and watch the old used oil come out of your engine. Then pull your oil filter and replace it with an new one, and pour the new oil in. Fast and easy. No muss no fuss. It's the easiest and cleanest oil change I've ever done. I showed it to a friend and he rushed to Amazon to buy his own. I highly recommend it.tim...."
4,This thing sucks!,"Impressions upon opening the package were highly posive do the quality of the materials. This thing looks like it would cost much more than it did. The only dissappointment was the short length of the tubes that came with the unit. They are not long enough to change transmission fluid. However, longer tubes are easily purchased for couple bucks from a hardware store.The operation is simple and fast. A few pumps and out comes the fluid. Very easy to dispose the fluids with out making a mess. I recommend this product."
5,Great Product,I used this product to change the oil on my car. This product worked flawlessly. It is also very sturdy and well made product.
4,Great product,"Mityvac 7201 is great. It was a lot easier to change motorcycle oil, transmission oil, or just try to suck fluids out of anythings that is hard to get to. Only draw back is hard to clean."
1,"Save your money, better to just hooked a drain valve and add a hose for a clean drain","Air was leaking from the top side cover in between the two screws where the suction tube outlet is located. I have tightened tightened the screws/nut and it still leaks air unless i'm clamping on it with my two hands. I tested it out on my brake master cylinder reservoir and it worked fine. After pumping till my arms got tired, I only ended up with about a quart of used oil, which in fact was at operating temperature. I'm sure if there was no leak, I wouldn't have had to pump as much. I ended up just draining from the bottom, which was 100x easier."
2,Wouldn't hold a vacuum,"So far this has been a big disappointment, but I think it's due to a quality defect. I tried pumping the oil out of my BMW (8 quarts), and it took 45 minutes and 200+ pumps, and yes the oil was hot and the cap was off.Upon investigating, it appears the main plastic tube was poorly cut at the end--almost like a crimp, which won't let it seal with the second tube going into the dipstick. I will re-splice and try again, but even if that works, they get 2 stars for the out of box failure."
3,NOT for all vehicles,"I tried to use this to change the oil on my Ford F150 5.4L V8 4WD truck. I carefully slipped the tube down the dipstick tube, and it slid in easily. However, when I tried to remove it the tube would not come out. I tried everything I could think of and it would not come out. A tow to the mechanic ended up with removing the oil pan to get the stuck tube out. I finally found a review from another user who had the same problem with the same vehicle, so I think it's safe to say do not use this product on your Ford V8 truck."
4,Mity Vac,"Mityvac 7201 Fluid Evacuator PlusThe manufactuer needs to replace the tubes supplied with this piece of equipment with tubing that is less temperature sensitive. Once in the warm oil, they curl-up. I lowered the rateing 1 for this reason. Otherwise the rate would have been 5. George G Port Saint Lucie, FL"
5,Excellent Vac,I use this for changing the oil in my Mercedes S320. It performs flawlessly and with minimal effort. I look forward to using it again.
1,Marketing boys and their marketing toys,"I hate to sound like a snob, but it's hard to imagine anyone over the age of 5 being at all intrigued by this silly little CD. The music is great, well mostly great, of course, and a couple of the performances (Reiner's ""Zarathustra,"" Gould's ""Grand Canyon"") are among the best out there. Others (Tomita's awful synthesized Debussy) scrape the bottom of the barrel. The big question is WHO is likely to enjoy something like this? Only children and adults with very, very limited attention spans who don't like really classical music, I'll wager."
3,Does not have all 1990's,"If your looking for a book that would have Barbie, Skipper, ken, stacey, Kelly and friends. This is not the book you want.It doesn't even have all the 1990's barbie dolls, it is only from 1980 to 1997. It Only has Barbie, Friends and no family."
3,1990's Barbie Dolls,A very anticipated book because this was the decade I predominantly collected Barbies. However it fails to showcase many of the special edition Barbie Dolls and International Barbie Dolls produced at certain times of that period. Quite a small book and would of preferred pictures to be bigger and more information about the Barbie itself.
3,Didn't Make Me Happy,"I was fairly pleased when I received this umbrella, although something about the fabric made it feel seem a bit ""cheesey""...worse than the $20 beach umbrella I was replacing.I had been careful to keep it folded in bad weather, but one day we had a sudden wind come up. The pole broke cleanly in two at the plastic tilt connector. I would not buy again as this one plastic part is too flimsy to count upon."
3,buyer beware!,"These are great films, and they deserve better treatment.""Traveller"" and ""Matewan"" are NOT widescreen presentations and ""Breaking the Waves"" is not 1.85:1,as listed on the case, but is 2.35:1. Nit-picking? I think not, as I believe that even though these are budget-priced discs, films should be presented widescreen if that was the theatrical presentation, and ""Traveller"" could have done with a 5.1 sound mix given that there are no extras. I guess i would rather pay more for premium treatment of great movies, than pay less and have to settle with just being thankful that the movies are on disc at all. A missed opportunity from ARTISAN, especially since the potential buyers for movies such as these three would happily pay extra for top-notch releases."
2,Good Movies - Bad Picture Quality,I was suprised to find the films of these disks not presented in widescreen. The overall picture quality seems very poor.
2,"Matewan: phenomenal movie, terrible dvd","I can only comment on Matewan, since it's the only one I've watched, but is is abundantly clear that whoever produced this DVD did the cheapest job of it they could. NO subtitles, NO special features, wrong aspect ratio, crappy sound, *terrible* picture quality, etc. I'm not a videophile and this is the first time I've ever been so disappointed with a dvd. Incredible movie though."
2,Good Movies - bad copies,I was suprised and disappointed to find these films squashed into the square TV format (instead of widescreen). The picture quality is also poor. I've learned a valuable lesson: just because its on DVD doesn't mean its good.
3,Fit kind of...,I should have measured the circumference of the antennas because they are not has thick as the one I was trying to replace. DUH. They still worked but they just did not fit as well.
4,"Not perfect, but good enough","First of all, let it be known that I bought this collection for one story by one of my favorite authors: ""The Wedding Album"", which did not disappoint. Of course, I had to get my money's worth by reading the whole thing.There are some real gems in this collection: Bear's gruesome classic ""Blood Music"", Ian Macleod's superb ""Breathmoss"", Sterling's ""Dinner in Audoghast"", ""Daddy's World"", and a few others. Unfortunately, these excellent works stand up like islands in a sea of others that range from ""good"" to merely ""competent"". There was one story in particular that had me scratching my head as to why it was included.I agree with another reviewer, in that I understand that Dozois wanted to create a well-rounded collection precisely by not picking the most widely-read works. That said, a collection of stories with the equally visceral punch of ""Blood Music"" and ""The Wedding Album"" would have really rocked my world.Recommended."
3,Good Read,"Science Fiction has under gone many changes since I started reading this genre in 1965. Some years are better than others. This collection of stories has a several gems, the rest are adequate to keep my attention."
4,"Finally, befitting its title!","This collection indeed compiles some of the best novellas that had been anthologised by Mr Dozois in the previous years as 'Annual Collections'. In terms of subject, style, structure etc. etc., these stories cover the entire gamut. My only regret is that some a few thrillers of more of pieces written by Connie Willis would have made the collection a little more entertaining. Nevertheless, recommended."
4,great card reader,"reader came free with the puchase of the microSD card. It's compact & functional. Gave the reader to my friend who's has the Samsung Memoir, which uses MicroSD for the photos. Better than using the SD adapters the cards usally come with & easier to use, pop in, slide out. Doubt she'll use the Sony M2 slot, but good to have just in case."
1,Short life...,"I used it maybe four times before it failed. ""USB device not recognized"" is all I get when I plug it in. I have checked it on my laptop, desktop and another laptop. No go."
1,False advertisement,"The description said this reader would be free when buying a Sandisk 32GB MicroSDHC card. I ended up getting charged around $9 for it, and never got the time to call them to question. Haven't felt it's worth spending time to make the call since it's only $9, but the 'false advertisement' is still kind of annoying..."
3,Mistake to buy adapter for microsd,first off all it looks like it comes with the memory card. but it is only a memory card adapter. u have to buy memory aditional >20 dollars.yesterday i went to a store and bout a memory card with its adapter with 27 dollars. i think this one is better.the seller should clearly write to notify the items on sell.by the way it was shipped very fast.
1,CRASHED,"I purchased this card reader to use at my job. I have tried to use it on three different computers and each time I plugged it in, it crashed the computer. It is a cute little device but did not work out good for me"
4,very usefull,"Got it for my micro SD card, it works just fine. The only thing is that in the picture I thought the little key chain squares were mini card holders, like, if I had more than 2 cards I could put one in the stick and keep the other in the key chain. Turns out it is just a reference so you know which one is which, they're basically just decorations. I guess I should have read it better, but then again it's no big deal. The important thing is that card reader works perfectly fine, so I am happy with it. =]"
4,Worth it.,"I haven't had to use this often but often enough with a number of cards and devices. It's still in great shape and I'm very pleased with my purchase. I would have given it 5 stars but there are so many little pieces to move around and hopefully not lose, thus the 1 star deduction."
1,Didn't work,"This card reader did not work at all. I tried it on two different computers and with 2 different 4 gigabyte microSDHC cards. I bought another card reader at the same time, and it worked. It came free with my order, but they charged me $6.00 for shipping. It is fair to say that I am not pleased with the whole transaction."
4,Still has value as a reference,"Written in 1988, this book is somewhat behind the times. However, last fall when I was teaching a course in networking, there were a few times that I consulted it when I was covering some of the specific details of NetBios. The students in my class program in many languages, the one that they all have in common is C. Therefore, when I needed to present a specific point about NetBios using code, C was the only language that I could use. After consulting this book for the organization of the data structures, I was able to give the students sound examples of how to do things and was happy that I had kept this book in my library. Therefore, despite being almost ten years old, it still can be used as a reference when you need information about NetBios."
4,TJ Watson experience,This book is the first I had when I was in my training period at IBM TJ Watson RC. One of the best after reading the IBM TokenRing Reference Guide! Good Job for all who wants to know a little more about NetBios.
4,great book if you are thinking about joining the armed force,This book will help any one who is joining the armed forces
5,DARTH VADER,Marvelous. Just be careful when you stand it up because it fall over easy. Really movie phrases and sounds
3,All about karma,"Not sure whether I'm entirely on board with everything Vimalananda discusses on the topic of karma in this book. That said, it opens up many possibilities in terms of ideas. Which is always welcome. I found the book a little repetitive in some respects, but overall a useful addition to my library of Tantrik tomes."
2,Broke down after second use,"These glasses are fairly well made. Lenses are not bad, but they get scratches very quickly.Unfortunately, the frame broke down just after the second use, when I was changing the lens."
3,Combo Lenses Classes,"The glass set is very well made, however there is no instruction on the package how to switch lenses and judging by the overall look, it will be not easy."
4,good price point,"probably one of the best values available. it does, however, have a tendency to fog and/or become hazy due to condensation."
5,Wow!!,Let me start by saying that these glasses are definitely worth more than $18.00Pros:Comfortable even with protective ears wrapped around. Comes with 4 lenses. Comes with a well made case with slots for each individual lens. Soft contour bridge piece.Con:Does not come with cleaning cloth.Bottom Line:For the price point these blades are exceptional. They are not cheaply made blades. They do what its intended to do. Oh and... Treat them like a pair of Gucci glasses and they will not break!
2,"Good idea, very flimsy execution","The glasses looked great on arrival, as did the case with extra lenses. Huge problem with the product, though: as others have said, there aren't any instructions for removing the lenses, and upon trying to slide them out of one side, the frame snapped.I liked the design enough to try them again, and despite being extra careful this time, the same thing happened, at the same spot. Now I'm left with two broken frames and eight useless lenses.Very disappointed with this product."
4,Good value,"Bought a pair for the trap/skeet range and general target shooting. Yellow and red lenses work well. Bought a second pair for my wife. You would think changing the lenses would be a no brainer but the directions were lacking and I thought I was going to break them before I finally figured it out. Grab one side of the frame near the lense, hold the lense and pull...hard. Once you get one side out, it's a snap."
3,"Really Nice, But I Broke Them","I broke mine within 3 minutes after opening the carton - trying to swap out the lens. My fault, but there are no instructions with the product. Another reviewer seems to have it right: hold one side of the frame firmly, then pull the lens sideways so the small 'notch' of the lens comes out first. Playing with the nose piece won't get you anywhere. Otherwise it's actually a nice package, they fit well, the nose piece is adjustable, and the case has separate sleeves for the lenses to keep them from getting scratched up. Lens colors cover a variety of light conditions and scenarios."
4,An OK product,"Ok, the product matches what is described, all lens are perfect, case is very nice since it holds all lens in separate. A little bit too big for my face since it's for shooting and I've bought it to use with my bike. My mistake actually."
5,Pretty incredible,"I normally hate gimmicks, but these things were worth every penny when it came to hanging drywall on the ceiling. Really impressed with this product, and it performed as advertised."
5,"Very Inspirational, I still love this music 15 years later","I worshipped this music in my youth. I still have all the original albums, although they are a bit beat up at this stage. I was searching for Raw Sienna ( In my mind their greatest album, and one of my all time favorites), but a boxed set still captures one of the greatest white blues bands ever."
5,Savoy Brown Collection,Savoy Brown Wow ! This CD was great I relly enjoy everything that Savoy Brown has to offer . Hope there is more to collect !
2,mediocre,"I was an art history student when I took a class in 18th century art. This text is unfortunately the only survey of Rococo and French academy art from the era, so there are very few alternatives than just the Rococo chapter in a general survey book like Janson's History of Art. The material is organized thematically, not chronologically, which could be engaging if the text was not so confusing or superficial. Most of the book focuses on the art of the 17th century, and absolutely nothing after 1760. The section on Rococo interiors is fairly comprehensive, however, and to his credit, Minor does include writings from Winkelmann and Diderot, grave omissions from previous survey texts."
2,Not Worth the Effort,"Being an art history major and having read numerous books on 17th and 18th art, I found Minor's work to be one of the least helpful or accessible. He arranges his text by subjects instead of chronologically or by artist or by country. Though an interesting approach, it makes it difficult to follow the development of the arts through the centuries. Anyone really interested in Baroque art and culture should look instead to Julius Held and Donald Posner's classic text."
4,"Not bad, but it could have covered more",I was rather disappointed that this book didn't go into much depth about Netscape's Crown Jewels: 1) Netscape Merchant System 2) Netscape Publishing System 3) Netscape Community System 4) Netscape Smartmarks
4,Looking back...,It's amazing to see at what speed everything was being developed while I was playing around with Mosaic back in 1994.
3,Unforgivable lapses,"Two things: 1) Netscape's biggest problem (like Apple's and AOL's and just about everybody else's) is that instead of concentrating on their own strengths, they insist on defining themselves only by their relationship to Microsoft. So, even though this book is about Netscape, look at the cover: the name ""Microsoft"" is in bigger type than ""Netscape."" That speaks volumes. Netscape cannot blame Microsoft for the lead they let slip away by failing to take advantage of (among other things) their portal site. 2) How are we supposed to take a book like this seriously when it doesn't even have an index? Pretty shoddy work, there."
3,Speeding the Reading,"The first part of the book gave an entertaining account of the Netscape programmers' college years. It then went on to show us the frantic excitement surrounding Netscape, the start-up. After Netscape goes public, the details become light. The last half of book speeds through many of the facts at the pace of a CNN story. It should be called ""Speeding the Reading"". It is a shame that book did not have more unpublished details on Netscape acquistions or the technology leapfrog game between Navigator and Internet Explorer. In the end it was an interesting read; I'll be watching the sequel play out on the Web."
4,An Exiciting Ride,"Given the first two thirds of this book, it could be called ""The Inside Story of Netscape."" The last part of the book gives a good overview of the war between Netscape and Microsoft. There is a lot of good information about how the whole Internet craze began. It's an exciting ride.The book gives great insight to Netscape's side of the story. It takes a bit to get into it because each new player has to be introduced, where he or she began, and brought up to the present. There are quite a few players. So you might lose your place in the story if you put the book down too long. But hang in there. The story is exciting and moves along. You will find yourself rooting for those young programmers and hoping they make it.I can't wait to read the sequel."
4,Interesting account of Netscape's origin...,"Aleks, thanks for your anecdotes.I zipped through the first half of the book, vicariously living through Andreesen and company as they developed the browser and struck off on their own.I also felt the second half of the book could've been more indepth, as Netscape's battles to stem the Microsoft tide could surel have been recounted with a bit more flair. I really wanted to know how the main characters handled their newfound wealth/fame and the drop in Netscape's fortunes/stock price. Aleks...when did y'all cash out???"
1,Very disappointing,"I was quite disappointed with the quality of sound from this setup. Despite trying various EQ settings on my Ipod there was far too much distortion. It was ok if I turned the volume down, but for 1/5 the price of this I can buy computer speakers that will perform as good if not better. it I will be returning it for a refund today."
3,They're okay... not great,"The sound quality isn't as crisp as I've heard, but they are reasonably loud enough to fill a hotel room. However, the louder you play the more distorted the sound. I was expecting a great product in a small package. The package is great, compact, easy to pack in your suitcase.... but the sound is just okay. Keep your expectations reasonable and you'll be okay. Mostly, these speakers are great for travel, but not for high quality sound."
3,You get what you pay for,"I tested this product quite a bit when I was looking for a home stereo system for my iPod. The sound is okay at a low level--it's actually better than I'd have thought considering the size--but distorts quite a bit when you turn it up much. You also have to adjust the settings on your iPod to get it to play well--there's a small speaker option on most of them. The upside of course is that it's portable, so you can take it with you on a trip or wherever, and it's cheap. For me, however, it comes to this: when I pay as much as I did for 'the next generation' of music (the iPod) I want it to sound like the next generation of music. With that in mind, I prefer a higher end, better sounding stereo system."
3,Cracked For No Reason,"I found these speakers convenient to use and the sound was fine, but after just a few months, the on/off button simply cracked in half for no reason. The company has ignored my email asking about whether or not this in included in the warranty. I don't think a speaker system should fall apart after just a few months of probably less than average use. I would question buying another of these...."
4,"Very cool idea and great sound for its size, but...",just one addition to the comments so far. The case of the speakers is vibrating very strong. The iPod leans against this case and therefore is also vibrating. This sometimes produces loud unwanted noise and I am not sure how this affects the lifetime of the internal hard disk.
5,Perfect compliment to the i-pod!,"I just received my INMOTION speaker system and it's already what I had hoped for! Great sound but even more exciting very small and portable. I love my i-pod but don't get to enjoy it much with the ear buds. I currently have my new speaker system in the kitchen for all to hear and can hardly wait to take it camping, boating or just out in the yard if I want."
2,not that great,"This is a very cute package and an innovative design, but I find the sound quality to be very sub-par. It's a shame too because I had really high hopes for this product! I own several sets of Altec Lansing speakers and I am a huge fan of their stuff, but these are truly disappointing :( Spend about eighty dollars less and buy the Altec Lansing VS2120's- they're not as cute or easy to travel with, but they sound 110% better!!"
1,"Good Concept, Poor Product!","I like the idea of having portable speakers for my ipod, but Altec seemed to not put much effort in to the quality of manufacturing these speakers. Within two months of use my left speakers went out. I opened it up to find that the motion to open them split the wire because they were not tucked away properly. Currently I have gone in and ghetto ridged the speakers to work. The core components are there but the assembley is bad. Sounds like other people are having better luck with theirs, just beware of potential problems."
3,Not worth the money,"Hi,Just received mine. Nice design and packagin. But the sound is not worth it. It sounds like a tin canDo not waste your $ on this"
1,Not worth it,"I received the Altec as a gift and was excited to use it with my iPod. The sound quality just isn't there. It sounds tinny and certain higher notes that are heard with headphones and other speakers are missing with the Altec. It's like not hearing the violin in an orchestra. That's really annoying. Finally, there's an odd vibration when playing the iPod and I find myself constantly readjusting the iPod in the stop the vibration.I've switched back to my [..] cheapo speakers I got at the office supply store. Save your pennies for the Bose iPod docking station."
2,Total Waste of Money!,"Come on?! Do you really expect to get any sort of sound out of this cheap product? If you are an ant with really small ears, then you may like the crappy sound. This is so overpriced. People are jsut falling into the whole iPod ""gotta have it"" syndrome, that they pick this up and may think its great?I recommend buying a 50.00 pair of computer speakers and hooking them up instead. You will get way better sound!The only +++ of this product is that its really small, but that is also its downside when it comes to quality sound."
4,Great Speakers for Your IPod,I am very happy with this purchase. I use the speakers in my office and take them on the road with me. The sound is great and they are very easy to fold and go. The only thing I would change is the volume controls. They are two buttons with with a plus and minus respectively. I prefer a knob or some type of dial. I highly recommend these to anyone looking to purchase a mobile set of speakers for their IPod.
5,amazingly powerful and small sound system,"i dont own one of these (i dont even own an ipod) but my best friend has a set of these for his ipod. let me tell you, size doesnt matter. these little babies have got amazing sound, and are amagingly portable. they are no bigger than a notebook (each speaker is the size of an ipod, and there is a base they fold into) but they are better than my cd players speakers, which are about 7inches by 14inches. i definately suggest these, i think they are just a tad pricey tho. but think about it: you get surround-sound quality speakers that are above all portable."
4,I'm glad I have this baby,"Although this item is a little pricey and you can find options with better sound, here's why I like this unit:1. It serves as a second docking station and iPod charger.2. It's compact and portable, i.e. smaller than most hardback books.3. It gives me a variety of options, i.e. hotel use, take to work, to play music outside, etc."
2,Hate to ding this otherwise fine product but...,"As noted by some other reviewers, this product is good, but the docking function does ***not*** work properly, at least with Firewire connecting to a Mac. Copying large files over the Firewire attachment (I use my iPod to store big files that I want to work on at home) bogs the computer down to the point where I have to unplug the iPod and connect it to the cable directly. iTunes connection probably works okay, but there seems to be a problem with using the unit in full firewire disk mode. I've returned my set and will try again with the deluxe version of the speakers later."
2,Many pitfalls,"This unit is ok for just putting your iPod in and playing music over the speakers.The docking pass though does not work for USB on XP. XP will not recognize it though the docking station, but if you take the iPod off the docking station and connect direct it works fine. This does not allow you to leave the iPod in the charger while connected to your PC. At least with XP and USB.Also if you get one of those remote control units that goes on top, you cannot control the volume though the remote, you must use the volume control on the base unit."
1,Advice,"I must admit, the initial euphoria of having finally purchased an iPod combined with the good name of Altec Lansing resulted in my purchase of the inMotion system.What has my experience been? Unfortunately, not satisfactory. The static that is continuously emitted from the speakers drives you crazy. This problem seems to be known to Altec as it's addressed in the Instruction Manual-being put down to the compression of the music in the iPod.Is there a solution? Yes, buy a different set of speakers."
3,not as good as the logic 3 istation,"I bought a pair of the logic 3 istation speakers at the same time as the altec lansings. the istation came first, and I was very impressed at the bass, volume and quality of sound I could get from them. My ipod 60 fits right in and charges as I use it and also transfers data nicely. The altecs came and I sent them back as I wasn't as impressed. I've had the best speaker systems in the world and can tell you that these are no match for them, but only a few unreasonable people would expect them to be. They are the best at what they do. You can adjust the eq on the ipod to small speakers and that seems to work the best for me. It's also holding up nicely after a few months of hard use."
3,A little too pricey...,"To keep it short and simple...1. It is convenient to plug this in. It acts as a docking station and/or a charger.2. It can take batteries... folds down nicely... so it gets an ""A-"" for portability....3. It takes in Aux input and has a headphone jack for output. That is a plus.4. If it sounded better (or if it was cheaper) I would give this 5 stars. I can destroy the bass easily and this is with very good recordings (and some iTunes purchases). Seems changing the equalizer on the iPod doesn't make it much better. Thus is uber bummer... and why I only gave it 3 stars."
1,disappointed,"My inmotion worked well for the first two times I used it. After that, it started popping and evenually stopped altogether. I have attempted to call tech support on numerous occations as well as using the altec lansing customer service e-mail. I have never been able to get through either source. I am not only disappointed with the product, but even more so with the support. I have wasted my money!"
4,Great little sound system!,"What can I say...XLNT set of travel speakers.These don't have the ultra-rich-deep bass of the Bose system, but that can be easily adjusted with the iPod settings to compensate for what little is lacked. (Problem solved)I have traveld with these for the last two-weeks, and think that I would need a twelve-step program if I had to give them up.Small, portable, light-weight... Perfect!!!"
2,has to be plugged in,"this item plays very well when it is plugged in, but when you unplug it and try to make it portable, which it is suppose to be, it gets very staticy and just stops playing. I would not recommend it for being a protable player."
4,Sound not as good as a Bose,The sound in the high range was a little distorted. I miss the convenience of a remote to be able to go on to the next song but for the money it is a very nice little unit and it will be no problem in packing for travel.
4,A solid performer,The small speakers produce reasonably good sound. It conveniently recharges the iPod. The compact size makes it easy to tote along.
1,Quit after less than a month,"Seems like QC is a lost art these days. Although we bought the AL iPod system for its compact design and sound quality, our pleasure was short lived. The thing just stopped working after just a few plays. The light comes on, but no sound comes out. AVOID! AVOID! There's no excuse for new things not working."
4,Could use a smaller form factor,"It's actually rather lightweight which makes me think that there's some ""dead space"" inside that could be removed to make this a bit more sleek. The folding design is good, though, and I've traveled all over the world with it, so no complaints there. The sound quality is good for the size of the speakers, but nothing outstanding. There are undoubtedly better-sounding products out there, but not in this price range."
1,Broke 2 ipods with no warning,"These speakers were awesome for a while. For a year and a half they were perfect, with a good sound.One day they just randomly started to short out, completely breaking my dad's ipod. At first we though it was just my dad's ipod since we hadn't mihandled it or anything, so i plugged my ipod in and it messed up mine too, so that it only plays out of one ear and doesn't hook up to the high speed port anymore."
2,Not what I remembered it to be,I loved this when I was growing up. I like his newer albums much better. Fun to listen to school's out though
2,"""Audiophile"" Gold CD Flunks Sound Quality Test!","Don't get me wrong,this classic Alice Cooper album is worth 5 stars in my book,but this gold CD offers no improvement in sound quality over the unremastered one (which you can buy dirt-cheap ANYWHERE!).It's still sounds thin and muddy,nowhere near as good as theBillion Dollar Babiesand theWelcome to My Nightmareremastered reissues Rhino put out a few years back.Save your money and buy/keep the old one!"
2,Really surprised about the sound.,"I've never owned the School's Out CD before. To my ears, this sounds like an 80's CD thrown out to the mass market just to get it out there. Very disappointed with the sound, thin sound, no oompth, muddy. I was expecting way more than this, I doubt that the original would be any worse than this CD. I would save your money, and just buy the original one. Or wait for a proper remaster job from Rhino, they seen to always do a top notch job. Billion Dollar Babies 2 CD set sounds good, so does Muscle of Love, I bet Welcome to my Nightmare would sound good as well. Anyway, avoid this. I have never owned one of these types of premium discs, with the premium price before, and probably won't bother again."
3,The worst from Coop's originals,"That isn't saying its terrible: the title track and My Stars make the album worth purchasing(or at least finding a best of collection with both on it). The rest either were unfocused but average(Public Animal #9, Blue Turk, Luney Tune) or just wastes(Grande Finale, Alma Mater). After the excellent Killer, School's Out is a big letdown. Plus it didn't date very well and the production is not very good. They would rebound better on the next years Billion Dollar Babies."
1,A capa no é igual ao original,"O disco continua muito bom, mas a arte da capa no é igual ao lanado em 1972. A capa no monta imitando a carteira escolar e no as mesmas partes do original. Vale pelo som mas no para quem deseja o disco com a arte original"
1,School's Out,"School's Out - a really poor song. Hah? Hit?! Just kidding - no it's true. awful song. what a MESS. the album is good, but the song... School's Out wrecks the album."
4,5 STAR ALBUMS NEED TO BE REMASTERED!,"THE ALBUM IS A MASTERPIECE, IT NEEDSTO BE REMASTERED THOUGH. IT REALLYDESERVES IT."
5,This is the music of my youth!`,I remember when this album was originally released on vinyl and it how Cooper completely dominated the charts then. The album encompasses all of the yearnings and angst of 15 year olds everywhere (and some 40 year olds). Well worth it.
2,Disappointing remaster from Audio Fidelity,"Has the Huffman lost his touch, or is being a celebrity wanabee going to his head? It is very doubtful that this is from the original analog master tapes, and even the liners are very vague on the source used. Sonics tell the tale. There is lots of definition and detail, excellent separation, and as good a soundstage as this can have. But it still sounds digital, unlike the earlier Huffman remasterings for the defunct DCC. Clarity is favored over warmth, and the high end - cymbals in particular - sound bright and exhibit digititis.Not a bad remaster at all, and betters the stock Warners CD. But not up to the standards of DCC, or for that matter, anywhere close to what the Mobile Fidelity true analog, and true original master standard is.Not worth the money. Message to Huffman - upgrade your digital front end, and stick to original analog master tapes."
4,"Hey, remember the panties on the original release?","""Killer"" is a fav album in my collection without a doubt. Definitely a must have. ""Schools Out"" is really just a better than average outing. But remember the stir they created and the great PR they got with the original packaging. The album cover, depicting an old school desk with carvings and initials, opened like a school desk, and the protective jacket for the vinyl was a pair of panties. Still got mine. Pretty funny stuff."
5,Alice Cooper at THEIR best!,"What can someone say about this gem of rock history? It is one of the best albums by Alice Cooper (the man and the band), there are no flaws here. This gold edition has excellent sound. Alice has no remastered editions for most of his albums so this is the best you can have for now. My only concern was that it would have no booklet but it turns out it has one just not in the jewel case (no lyrics though). Also, it is numbered and limited to 2000 copies so all you Cooper fans better buy soon for it will not be arround for long!"
4,And We Got No Class...........,"You have heard the title track a million times, and the disk is worth buying for that song along. I don't think this album was as strong as the other Alice Cooper Band releases with Warner Brothers, but it's still a really good disk. Besides the title track, you have to hear 'Gutter Cat vs. The Jets' a kind of goofy send up of 'West Side Story', and the follow up quickie instrumental 'Street Fight'. One of my favorite tunes on the disk is 'Alma Mater'. The rain storm sound effect, the echo vocals and the ending lyrics where Alice hopes he will be remembered really give the song a melancholy feel that will leave you thinking back to old buddies you haven't seen or heard from in awhile. And when will Quentin Tarentino use 'Grand Finale' in one of his movies? That would have been perfect in Kill Bill, just a big old 70's wall of sound instrumental. Pick it up, with Alice Cooper you just can't go wrong."
3,Great message - not so sure about the format,"The real meat in Pete Greig's 'The Vision and the Vow' is an urgent call to radical discipleship. In an age where we have reduced 'becoming a Christian' to mean that you once stuck your hand up in an evangelistic meeting, this is an important message. The proposal to adopt 'rules of life' as a framework for discipleship runs against our culture and will raise questions for some branches of the church, but is well argued and biblically rooted.So why do I only give this book 3 stars? Well, the double sided format is confusing and puts it in the 'novelty' section, when it actually deserves better than that. The 'vision' and 'vow' sections are aimed at different audiences and sit uneasily together.If you can get past the format, this is a rewarding and thought provoking read. I reckon that if a publisher would re-issue 'The Vow' on its own with a different cover, it would probably gain the wider readership that it actually merits!"
1,Beware,"Beware-- this is false teaching totally contrary to God's Word. This author is part if a cult that looks spiritual when in fact, it is eastern mysticism with roots in paganism. Stay away!"
4,Good...,the product to be prepared when it is handled ... so that on occasions can come bent pins ...
3,"Not entirely satisfied with HPa500n (Great MB,Crappy case)","Great MB, has 5 usb 2.0 front 3, rear 22firewire plugs front 1, 1 rearaudio plugs both front and rear headphoneplug,input, and mic up front.Motherboard includes 2 SATA plugs, so potentialy 8 Sata, and one additional Ide HD (9) total ""potentialy""2Ide connectors onboard CDr/w and DVD HD is using a proprietary cable so u have to order annother cable to fill the last ide device (money grubbers)unfortunatly there is no way to mount even just 1 additional HD, without purchasing THEIR HD ""cage"", which I could not find on their website, despite their correspondence that said it was.Powersupply 250W BARE MINIMUM, I will have to upgrade case to intall more HDs, and the power supply for ANY casefans.No Recovery CD included, but u could buy one from them (money grubbers) they did put a recovery Partition on the HD subtracting 5 gigs from the 60Gig HD"
5,Artists,"Great book for history of Egyptology. I used this book for college egyptian history and I kept it because of the illustrations. Good read, lots of information."
2,where are the free form projects,I was disappointed by the lack of free form projects in the book. Most of the projects simply involves stripes. The one scarf is a solid color with a drop stitch. I am going to keep looking around for a book that actually has more than a title and a cool cover.
3,a couple glaring problems,"Accolades aside for the music itself, there are two reasons to be miffed by this cd, though the problems stem from the original LP release: tape hiss and distortion (like someone blowing into the microphone) when the music peaks out. The cd insert (from the LP) mentions these problems, though of course they aren't apparent in the TV episodes...Secondly, while ""The Cage"" seems complete (thankfully the music during warp-speed is omitted), ""Where no man..."" is not. The music to the climactic 5-10 minute battle between Kirk and Gary is omitted! The insert says the master tapes were unedited. Was it that LP's were limited to 45 minutes (the album runs 43 min)? Whatever the reason, it's a disappointing result.While I'm glad for the music available and have gotten used to the problems, I wish they could have at least corrected the omission when they released the cd."
4,The Cage missing music,"Sadly, one of the best & most recognizable variations on the the cage theme is missing here. During the transition from the ""country picnic"" scene to ""Rigel 7"" there is that eerie chromatic soprano over a thumping timpani drum sounding like a heartbeat. Glockenspiel type bells play in the background. This theme was used over & over again in various episodes, usually when someone would be overcome by some spores or other alien force & enter a trance or euphoric state. As it contains the essential ""Cage"" theme & is so prevalent in other episodes I sorely miss a good recording. Will GRP Crescendo ever release more OST soundtracks? There is still so much great music from those 3 seasons that has never been released !!"
4,"Nice, clean and beautiful with only one problem.","The only problem I have with this unit is that the metal ring is not very tight and unless care is taken, frequently pops free. I don't know if this is particular to the unit I have but it is not a deal breaker.I would nevertheless recommend."
2,The Picture of this Jar is Deceptive,"When looking at the picture shown of this ""Bormioli Fido Clear Round Canning Jar 5 Lt."" one sees a rather squat, low-profile glass canning jar with the mouth of the jar as wide as the diameter of the jar itself. The jar is depicted as being almost as wide as it is tall, and that was what I was expecting. What I got was a very tall 5 liter jar with a small mouth. The picture is very deceptive."
5,Great Sun Tea Jar,"We bought this to make sun tea and for this purpose it works fabulously. Glass is the way to go for sun tea, and we had difficulty finding a large glass container locally, so as usual we found what we were looking for on Amazon.com!"
5,"Thorough, detailed, inspirational & easy to read","As a Canadian trained physician now transplanted to the US, I found the story of Osler inspirational and stirring.It may have helped that I had been to many of the locations in the book making it seem much more 'alive'. The style of writing was easy to follow, yet there was an obvious scholarly detail and depth. It has encouraged me to read more on the history of medicine. Quite engrossing."
3,Part of the adapter missing.,"When we received this order, it only included the adapter half. There was no cord to plug into the wall outlet. I called Amazon and we received a replacement by next day shipping. Unfortunately, it was also missing the same thing. As these come sealed in a box from Meade, I think they are the ones at fault here, not Amazon. I called Meade and they sent me the missing half with no problem."
2,too noisy,"We bought this heater for bedrooms and they are really noisy, so much so that ear plugs are required. Other than that they are a great heater. Every even heat, low profile."
2,"A product of the very ""lumpen intelligentsia"" it ridicules.","A mere patchwork of aphorisms, Stewart Home's ""Assault on Culture"" fails because of its inflated gesture. The book debunks itself as a product of the very ""lumpen intelligentsia"" it ridicules since the dialectics of the notions sought to be criticized backlashes against their very critique: Although ""The Assault on Culture"" suggests being about ""culture,"" the notion itself is not critically examined, but reinforced in the feuilletonistic sense of ""the art world."" This is manifest in such linguistic twists as the ""cultural worker""Ñtautological if ""culture"" had been more thoroughly reflected, backlashing into re-affirmation of its replace-term nevertheless. While ""The Assault on Culture"" may be in itself as much an aporia as Neo-ism is an oxymoron, ""The Assault on the Art World"" would have described the project better, and left its terminological calamities more obviously unresolved"
2,Voices from the Holocaust,"Voices from the Holocaust by Harry James Cargas was an ok book. I expected it to be mores about the experience the people had in the concentration camps, rather than the books they wrote about it. I liked Simon Wiesenthals story about tracking down Nazi criminals. I also liked Whitney Harris's story because it was more about the Holocaust than her books she wrote about it. I didn't like Arnost Lustig's story because it was almost all about the books he wrote, and it wasn't intresting at all. If your going to write a book called ""Voices from the Holocaust"", people who read it are going to expect to read about the Holocaust,and not about books other people wrote. My favorite story was Jan Karski's. I found it interesting because he talked a lot about the Holocaust, and about interesting things that happened there."
4,A Chronicle of a Dying Star,"This is a wonderful book, poignant yet revealing, just like the man it is about. Frances Kroll Ring was Fitzgerald's secretary in the last few years of his life. What she details in her memoir will enlighten anyone who has only ever thought of Fitzgerald as merely an alcoholic who just stumbled into writing. Yes, she records that he was drinking well up to his death, but he was also doing something important. He was in the middle of writing ""The Last Tycoon"", a work that was to be unlike his previous efforts, more mature and reflecting a different sensibility. But, as one finds out at the end of ""Against the Current"", he never realized his goal. The great work was left unfinished, and therefore one more tragedy closed the curtain on an already sad life."
5,A Rediscovered Snapshot,"The Los Angeles Times review got it right: This book ""is like a rediscovered snapshot, bringing a legendary figure into brief, vivid focus."" That snapshot also includes a perceptive young woman and her family, Fitzgerald's inner circle (Sheilah Graham, Scottie, Maxwell Perkins, and Edmund Wilson), and a slice of Los Angeles during its most creative period. Hollywood is the backdrop for this book and *The Last Tycoon*, which Fitzgerald was writing at the time, but there's no glitzy melodrama here, and Ring mostly steers clear of ""the Fitzorama""--her term for the literary-industrial complex that has grown up around Fitzgerald. By telling her story simply and beautifully, she produces the vivid focus mentioned above. The book also includes reproductions of letters, notes, and telegrams composed by Scott, Zelda, Perkins, and Wilson. Highly recommended."

3,Read the ingredients,"This stuff is just sugar, cornstarch, artificial flavor, and two artificial dyes. You still need to add egg yolks and cook it carefully like pudding. Now I'm thinking that it would be much better to make key lime pie from scratch using fruit if you can find it, or prepared juice. Even using artifical flavor with your own sugar and cornstarch would allow you'd to avoid the dyes. At best this is an expensive convenience."
4,Ideal for changing the oil in my '88 911,"I'm lucky enough to have a lift in my garage. I considered buying a big, bulky, lift drain but then saw this Lisle drain here on Amamzon. I put it together and used it for the first time last night, changing the oil in my '88 Porsche 911.Assembly was relatively easy - I really wish I could have used my electric screw driver to install the casters, but the instructions are pretty darn adamant not to do so. I was a good boy and followed the directions and my wrists were not happy as those 16 screws require work to get in.But it went together well.The funnel is large enough to easily capture the deluge of oil (10.5qts) that comes rushing out of 911's crank case. The unit worked very well. I'm quite happy with my purchase."
4,Serves it's Purpose,"It was quite easily put together and works just perfect under the lift, used it once so far, no mess. Only thing you have to worry about is if you wheel it around on an uneven surface it gets a little tipsy. All in all, a good deal."
4,drain pan,The lift drain pan works as it should . Its not to big so it dont get to heavy to drain when it is full .If you have a lift then it is much a neccesity. I read the reviews befor the perchess lots of stuff about dont use a screw gun and bad instructions. I found that it was very self expanitory with just dumping the hard ware on the floor. I use my screw gun all I did was turn the torqe setting down as not to strip out the plastic .
5,Great for changing oil at home(if you have an oil change pit).,Exactly what I needed to change my oil at home (I'm lucky enough to have an oil change pit in my garage). Price was quite a bit less than I thought I'd have to pay for this.
5,Author's typo corrections -Pie in the Sky,"PIE IN THE SKY by Susan G. Purdy (HarperCollins Publishers) Thanks you for your interest in my book.CORRECTIONS below for typographical errors in first edition. Corrections are made in reprints; I want you to have celestial results, so please check your book. Have fun baking!pg. 119,Chocolate Buttermilk Cake, step #3:Baking SODA is correct! NOT baking powder.pg. 196, Lemon Sponge Cake, step 6, add: ...fold in flour... ""along with previously whipped whites.""pg. 250, Brownies, introduction: cross out reference to brown sugar in first line, only white sugar is used.Pg. 123, Mocha Buttercream: Use 6(six) cups confectioners' sugar and only 5 to 6 tablespoons coffee instead of 1/2 cup . Also, make these adjustments on pg. 124 in procedure. Note that volume of frosting varies slightly depending on whether made with processor or mixer.pg. 192, at 7,000 feet, bake coffee cake at 350 degrees not 375.pg. 176, step #3: at sea level use 1/2 cup sugar , not 1/3 cup."
3,The Jury is Out,"I've been baking successfully for years and fairly easily made the transition to 5,000 feet after living my whole life next to the Mississippi. That move was more than 15 years ago but I still keep an eye out for high altitude cookbooks.My first attempt from this book was a cake. It was the most delicious cake I have ever tasted. The instructions were easy to follow and the results were fantastic.My next attempt was a batch of chocolate chip cookies. As with the cake, I followed the instructions exactly. The results... not so good. The cookies did all the things that the book said were a problem with cookies at high altitude. Obviously, this recipe did not contain solutions to those problems.So, is this a good book? I'm not sure. For me, this book needs more testing in my kitchen before I'm willing to buy it. I recommend you do what I did. Borrow the book from the library. Bake a few items from the book and if you get good results, buy the book."
4,High Altitude Baking,"This book is good for anyone who lives at high altitudes. I have yet to use it, but it has wonderful charts and instructions for those of you who are confused as to how to change the ingredients and oven temperatures."
2,"some, yes, some, no","My results with this book have been mixed. I live in Cheyenne, Wyoming (about 6,000 feet). The Angel-Food Cake recipe was good; however, I had poor results with the chocolate chip recipe. After experimenting with the remainder of my dough, it seems like the recipe should require a great deal more flour (almost a full cup more).In the recipe's dialogue, the author happily reports that the chocolate chip recipe works (essentially unmodified) between sea level and 7,000 feet. I think most people baking at high altitude could easily testify that their rude awakening to high-altitude baking occurred with some simple cookie recipe that worked well at lower altitude, only to blow up (and fall) at higher elevation. The claim that one baking recipe delivers consistent results between sea level and 7,000 feet seems counter-intuitive and, in my experience, is false."
1,disorganized mess,The recipes need to be in some sort of order in an index. The pointless anecdotes are infuriating when one is in a hurry to find a recipe. I have baked in Colorado since I was a child and these recipes do not turn out well. The cakes are heavy and some of the recipes are crytic and incomplete. The general suggestions regarding modifications for high altitude can be found using any Internet search engine. This is a total waste of money and time.
1,Pie in the Sky Confusion,I moved from Sea Level to over 7000 ft. I needed a book to help me learn to bake at this higher altitude. This is not a good book for that. It gives a lot of recipes only two of which I could find the ingredients to try. Almost every recipe calls for buttermilk. They do not sell Buttermilk in the country where I now live. The two cakes I made turned out badly. The Angel food cake was like styrofoam after a day. The other chocolate cake had all the chocolate flavor of a brick. I am very unhappy with this purchase.The book is full of stories from the author on her high altitude mistakes. I did not make this purchase for stories..
5,great book,"I just love this book! Looks like new, and is full of great recipes for high altitudes.I just made the carrot cake, and it turned out terrific!Thanks!"
5,Fantastic for High Altitude Baking!!!,"Last summer I moved to mile high living in Boulder County, Colorado, from sea level life at the Jersey Shore, and I found that some of my favorite recipes would just not work! I tried all the typical adjustments that people recommended to me (I even talked to a local baker), but my problems were not solved. Then my sister gave me Susan's book for Christmas! I have made several items from this book, and they all turned out well. I especially like the table layout of ingredient measurements, showing how much to use at any altitude. It's true that there are ""only"" 100 recipes in this book, but you can be confident these recipes will work! Also, Susan suggests using her recipes as guides for adjusting other recipes (e.g. adjust your dessert bread recipe according to the one she developed). This book contains great recipes and is an excellent reference for high altitude baking."
2,The cake is a lie,I got this book from the library so I could try before I bought it. So glad I did - the cakes come out dense and dry. The only recipe I liked was for the blueberry muffins.
1,Songs are NOT Originals,"Save your money and don't buy this foreign junk out of Italy. Many of the songs are not originals and sound terrible. It might be worth purchasing at a bargain price, but not at $49.99. You can buy the original songs cheaper."
2,"Topper, Vol. 2",The Topper series is great but the quality of the DVD is terrible. It is scratchy and grainy. If it was remastered it was very poorly done. I don't recommend purchasing this DVD until they are able to remaster the series properly to remove the many flaws!
2,"Topper is tops, alpha flops","I gave the program a five star rating. Unfortunately, the source 16mm prints were not worth transferring to video. They are atrocious and a discredit to such a wonderful program.However, if low price is your primary consideration regarding purchase, used discs for sale on Amazon are a bargain. But, remember, ""GIGO"" (garbage in, garbage out). Or, simply, ""you get what you pay for."""
2,Time sure affects memory,"I loved this series a child, but it sure is lame now.We only made it through the first couple of episodes"
1,Forget it - get the Rowenta,"We iorn every piece of clothing for a family of six and thought we would try the Krups product after several Rowneta irons. Big mistake. Unreliable, uneven steam, spits, spills and is uncomfortable. Krups products support has been as bad.I'm going out to get another Rowenta."
3,"Great sound quality, decent performance.","I like Rubinstein's style of Chopin playing. Kissin simply doesn't sound enough like Chopin to me. My favorite version of these works is Zimerman's early version (w/ Giulini on DG). He is like Rubinstein, but with something of Horowitz's virtuousity.But the sound quality on this disk is great. I was expecting is to be lousy, since it was recorded in Communist Russia. But the bass was sufficiently powerful and the brass was rather individual.This disk is good. But not the best."
5,Outstanding,To imagine a boy of 14 playing these concerto's just perfectly is just amazing. These are the best recordings of the two chopin's around. And just beautiful and wonderful. His technical abilities and performance are outstanding. A must buy for all chopin lovers and anybody who loves classical music.
2,A bit disappointing,"I bought this map because I thought it would give a wider view of Paris, as I'm taking a vacation there toward the end of the year and I am thinking that it will be necessary to stay in a hotel a bit out of the center of Paris in order get an affordable nightly rate. Unfortunately it cuts off right before it gets to the 20th in the east of Paris."
1,Very rough guide,"Multiple misplaced Metro stations (e.g., Porte Maillot, Miromesnil), buildings (e.g., Ministre de l'Interieur) and hotels (the one I stayed in) made this map useless - I spent about an hour in total walking the wrong way because of such mistakes on a map that claims to have been ""thoroughly researched on the ground"".The tough waterproof paper is good; in fact it's essential as the manner in which the map is folded is so awkward you will come close to tearing it every time you use it.I'd recommend a map book; even the crude maps in the Lonely Planet guide are better than this."
2,Kindle Format is Horrible,"Just to be clear, this review is not about the book, but rather the Kindle format. First of all, the Kindle sample, does not give you any text, it only gives you the table of contents. Then, when you order it, the Sutra that begins each chapter is barely legible on the Kindle. I think they must have printed it in the book in gray and did not reformat for the Kindle. I asked for a refund and got the hard copy."
2,Disappointing,"The authors seem to disregard the original text and come up with their own Buddhism-inspired interpretations, thus failing to do justice to the Yoga-Sutra, which clearly is a Hindu scripture."
3,the perils of scholarship,"This is a scholarly and well-written book. Obviously, the author is erudite and expert. Alas, the author also seems so thoroughly modern as to be inadvertently condescending. Specifically consider the sub-title ""How the Early Believers Experienced God"". I would have expected a sympathetic exposition, and instead found a treatment that takes as its unspoken premise that the insights of modern antropology and cognitive neuroscience are 'right' not merely as possibility but so certainly as to allow us to explain how early believers misunderstood their experiences. Now, to be sure, some of the commentary is fascinating, perhaps even brilliant, but for me fatally flawed by seeming to exclude the possibility that at least some of these experiences represent true miracle. This book in my opiion fails to be open to possibility, instead seeming to insist on purely human explanations, which is certainly not ""how the early believers experienced God""."
3,customer service,did not like book. they have great customer service. got back to me in 1 hr and were very nice. would order again
5,ABSOLUTE BEST BLUEGRASS CD EVER RECORDED!!,"This CD was originally issued as ""New Dimensions in Banjo & Bluegrass"" on Elektra Records in the early 60's at the height of the ""Folk Revival"".Eric Weissberg is an absolute virtuoso, none finer on this planet, with the exception of Earl Scruggs.The songs included are an excellent representation of traditional Bluegrasss instrumentals. The weakest cut on the disc is the theme song which was added to this superb collection in order to make up the soundtrack for the film. Thank you Warner Brothers for making available ""The ABSOLUTE BEST BLUEGRASS CD EVER RECORDED""!!"
5,Dueling: An Old Southern Tradition,"Southerners have always enjoyed a good duel. Luckily we've resorted to banjos instead of pistols, finding the affair less bloody for the most part. There's nothing like this music. It takes you home.Lucy Adams, author of If Mama Don't Laugh, It Ain't Funny"
5,Probably the Best CD I own,I bought this CD based on the movie sound track and have discovered that it is probably one of the best banjo CD's out there. I highly recommend this CD for anyone even remotely interested in banjo music.
4,Great entertainment for all ages!,I recently watched Almost Naked Animals with my son and found it EXTREMELY funny!! My son has been a fan of the show on Cartoon Network but to be honest I had not watched an episode until we bought the It's My Party DVD. As an adult I could really appreciate the quick witted humor but as a Mom I was pleasantly surprised to find something that I found funny & entertaining but is also acceptable for my young children. Finding good quality entertainment at such a great price makes this an A+ find for this Mom! :)
4,Zany funny cartoons,"Almost Naked Animals is a joyously irreverent animated comedy series, featuring an oddly lovable assortment of free-spirited animals. They run a beach-front hotel like kids at a summer camp -in their underwear - making every day funnier than the last. Howie, the lead dog and hotel manager, leads the dysfunctional but very funny ensemble cast.Very funny, for the 4 year old and over...my girls had a blast watching it. Get ready for a fun time...."
3,A Disappointment,"My wife and I had previously purchased a copy of this book which we loved. We ordered these copies to make our annual donation to local libraries. My wife immediately noticed the artwork on the cover was not of the same quality as the first purchase. Upon further checking we discovered these books came from a different printer/publisher. We will be returning these books as we have found some from the ""good"" publisher elsewhere."
3,An In-Depth Glimpse!,"Another fine effort to capture the ocean in a teacup! I'm sure most Michelangelo fans will welcome every frame, but again, the man and the art each need their own attention."
2,nothing special,"one of the drawbacks to specialized message-driven genres such as 'christian music' is that it already has a built-in audience willing to sacrifice some quality and entertainment in exchange for the message. this album suffers from just that flaw. it's passable indie industrial rock, with female vocals, and as such is just ok. lyrically it's somewhat vague in parts, but if you pay attention you soon hear the message. not particularly distinct from similar goth acts from the same time, just a different, at times more hopeful, message."
3,My leftie son liked it!,My leftie son liked this book. It was cute. Im glad I got it for him. It made a cute gift.
5,Favorite Childhood Movie,"Wee Wendy was one of my favorite VHS movies when I was a child. If any of you have a little girl, this is a MUST have!!! I have always adored this movie! My tape is almost worn out from watching it so much as a child. I decided to look on Amazon to see by chance if this cartoon was still out there. I was very pleased to see it was and will be purchasing it soon!"
2,utter DISsatisfaction,"I feel Wendy's fascination with muriel was a bit uncalled for and frankly showing signs of immaturirty that in the stage of our nation, we simpy DO not need. Our nation is in somewhat of a ""gray"" area now, and the last thing my, or anyone elses child needs, is to have one more thing to thik about. Thank you, and goodnight."
4,authentic Americana,"Excellent Hard to Handle and Smokestack Lightning electric. Acoustic (including Wake Up Little Susie!) songs are fun if not exemplary musicianship as Reckoning was from later 1980. Excellent album for Pigpen fans! Not an album of long powerful improvisation, but illustrates the authentic American influences that bred this unique band. 2nd best acoustic recordings of Dead after Reckoning. From the same 2/1970 shows that are on DP #4...which is 10 stars!"
4,Finally found some Cold Blood!,"You will find the well known ""Lo and Behold"" and ""Down to the Bone"" on this CD, as well as the ""Make My Life Shine"" Boz Skaggs classis. Highly recommend for the Cold Blood fan."
4,This is good listening for fans of true R&B music.,"The only things on this CD that I truly miss are two cuts off of the ""Thriller"" album. These are ""You Are The Sunshine Of My Life"" and ""I Feel Like A Ball Game On A Rainy Day"". To me with the addition of these two cuts, this CD would have 5 stars written all over it. It is a shame that all of the albums released by CB are not available on CD's for there is some really fine material on all of them."
5,The music goes on forever! cstoltie@ctlnet.com,"I left a review about the Best of ColdBlood about a year ago. I am the son of the original drummer of ColdBlood Sandy McKee(Cecil Stoltie). I was very surprised to see the import of First Taste of Sin out. The music of this band is amazing. They played so well together and loved their music more than anything. Since my fathers death I have been trying to find more of the music and am very glad to see this being released. I know he would love to have a pair of sticks in his hands again and singing with, in my eyes, one of the greatest bands to ever play the bay area."
5,Hurt Me Lydia - Make Me Write Bad Checks!!!,"""COLD BLOOD"" IS THE BENCHMARK TO WHICH ALL OTHER HORN BANDS MUST ASPIRE. LYDIA PENSE'S VOICE WILL MAKE AN ATHEIST BELIEVE IN GOD. THEIR ARRANGEMENT OF ""I JUST WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU"" STANDS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THE REST. FROM THIS BASSIST'S VIEW, THAT SONG ALONE MAKES THIS CD WORTH WHATEVER PRICE IS ASKED."
5,There may be more ColdBlood tunes on the way.,"I am close to one of the original members of ColdBlood (Raul Matute). The internet and this Amazon website has sparked some interest in all of the old arrangements and sources of recorded material. If legalities, logistics, and financials can be finessed, the Best of ColdBlood is only the tip of the iceberg. I hope it all works out, because there really is a lot of great stuff just stored in some attic right now."
4,"Gettin down,down,down to the best of........",I saw Cold Blood at the Kennedy Center in D.C. back in the mid '70s and there were maybe 100 people there in the concert hall. They told us all to come sit down front in the stalls and then blew our socks off. This band had a HUGE sound with a dynamite female singer. Don't invite them to do stand-up comedy though. During the performance the guitar player broke a string and then they embarrassed us with some weak jokes. It was a relief when they started playing again. Why doesn't this best of have VALDEZ IN THE COUNTRY ON IT OR VISIONS. Those were good songs. Anyway they're still playing out here in the South Bay area around San Jose if anyone's interested.
1,How to change history,"I was one of the participants in the making of this video, and I am ashamed of having done this. The producers have tried to change the real history of the U-boat to make things more spectacular and very unfortunately are repeating themselves over and over again, as already mentioned in another review.History made it's own history of this U-boat, which is not historical correct at all."
2,This show sank with the sub!,"I have watched this show twice.It is short,only about 55 minutes long,you can't see squat of the wreck due to the conditions of the water,it repeats it self several times at where the commercials would be inserted.Eventhough the program is informative,I was very disappointed in the show.I do not recommend this program!"
2,Not for Dean Martin fans.,"This was not about Dean Martin, but was more of his daughter's memoir. There is not much about her life which is interesting to me."
5,Now a Deana Martin Fan as well,"What a fantastic read. When I'm standing in the bookstore, I can usually tell of my interest in the book by the time I finish page one. This one captivated me from the first paragraph. A well-written account from Dean's daughter, she gives great insight into the side of Dean Martin that we never knew from previous books we've read. Regardless of the truth you find out, you still end up loving Dean Martin just as much as you did before you started reading. Not only that, but you end up a fan of Deana Martin as well. It is also worth it for the ""secret recipe"" contained within. Buy this book! A must for ANY Dean Martin fan."
5,Enjoyable.,"Read this for a book club pick on a bio of Dean Martin. His daughter had an interesting life, the first 8-10 years with her mother then the remaining with Dean (& 2nd wife). Very insightful into that era of entertainers. His daughter remained a fan of Dean's until the end."
4,good read for summer,"Memories Are Made of This, well she's not a pullitzer prize author but it was good reading for the summer, or I guess anytime, nostalgic and fun to read if you remember the rat pack era..."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I am a number one Dean Martin fan, but this book is terrible. This book is about Deana, Deana, Deana, NOT DEAN! Deana's picture taken with the Beatles, Deana meeting Elvis, Deana in England at school, Deans's dates, Deana's career (not much). Deana marries a man that looks like Dean. I don't think she knows her father at all, other than she is Dean Martin's daughter, her raison d'etre. I didn't want to finish reading this book, but I paid for it, so I bored myself to death and did.elvis,"
4,A must read for a Fan,"Deana Martin gives a very honest, blunt portrayal of her father - faults and all. Very easy reading. And a must read for anyone who is a fan of Dean Martin."
5,"Good service, great book.",This was a gift for my husband. He loves the book and has read me some of the passages. He also loves the pictures.
2,An overly understanding recollection of her Dad,"Only worth reading if you're a real Dean Martin fan. Not very well written and a very ""Hollywood expose-ish"" novel. Some new info about Dean but not enough to recommend as a must read. I like ""Dean and Me - A love story"" by Jerry Lewis quite a bit better."
4,Dean Martin,"A thoroughly entertaining read. I've been a fan of the rat pack for years, but obtained some interesting insights in this read"
5,Not your ordinary Christian rock,"I bought the first CD and liked it, but this is the album that made me a fan. Musically, it's edgy without being inaccessible; in fact, several of the songs are quite catchy. Lyrically, the songs are clever, inspirational, convicting, all in all stronger than the usual fare. The vocals are distinctive; it's not a sound many bands can duplicate. If you're still hesitant, listen to the sample clips and I think you'll fall in love like I did."
3,"It's ok, but you might want to keep looking","I thought about buying this CD recently then noticed that my dad had it. Now I'm glad I didn't get it. To me, the songs were kind of cheesy. They sounded very ""studio-ish"", rather than having that true ""Hawaiian"" sound that I was looking for. There's even these canned ""bird and surf"" sounds at the beginning and end of some songs. All of a sudden you'll hear, ""Chirp, chirp chirp"" and ""whish whish"" (that's supposed to be ocean wave sounds). Picture Lawrence Welk (who Buddy Merrill played with) playing Hawaiian music and you'll have an idea of what I mean. I would have preferred to give it 2.5 stars rather than 3. The CD isn't bad, but if you're not into your grandparents' music, keep searching."
1,Decaying Orbit,"I love scifi movies. They are always my first choice of purchase, however I regret buying this one. It is a lame movie and poorly acted. I didn't want to give it even one star, but the only way to get in this review was to give it at least one. If you 'have to see it' then rent it- if you can find it. My copy will just gather dust."
2,No point if it's out of date,"It's 2012. I bought this book in 2009 and then was disappointed to realize how out of date it was, but thought it would soon be updated. What's going on? Perhaps you are just expected to use the website. I would prefer to have the book version as well.This kind of book is nothing when it's out of date. To take just one example, PS 161 is reviewed here as a successful school. It declined dramatically in the last 3 years and would never make the cut now - in fact, it's now under threat of closure."
1,this book was not helpful,"This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon. I wish I hadn't wasted my $15 on this book! It is 7 years out of date. If you stepped off the plane in NYC, this book might offer some interesting tidbits about the NYC public elementary schools. If you've been in NYC for 1 month, as I have, this book offers no useful information."
4,My ex-husband left his doctorate field to be a lunch lady,"My ex-hubby left his field as a Professor of Masters students to be a lunch lady. We have a very amicable breakup and I'm still a bit of a sassy thing, so for a monumental occasion this year my son and I gave him the lunch lady. Thing is, he plays with it. Not like an action figure, but he will change the menu out for the lunch lady to serve.This is a hoot. And my ex is a good egg for taking the ribbing. So bring on the lunch lady in her glorious hair net and ice cream scoop and start serving the kids. In addition to the lunch lady we gave him the horror film stock charcaters, so that when the lunch lady sets out the day's meals the 'students' all look horrified. It's truly awesome in a sick way and my 9 year old likes to make diaoramas of the horror show that is lunch.To really add to the food fun, might I suggest Mr. Bacon vs. Monsieur Tofu Action Figures or perhaps Captain Corndog vs. Baron Von Broccoli."
2,Just for show,"I work as a ""lunch lady"" and thought it would be fun to have this figurine set out for the children to see as we served lunch. Our kids get a kick out of it. She is a sturdy figure and we change the ""menu"" almost daily. Rather than peel the meal stickers off of the backing and put them on the trays, I think that we will just cut the meals apart and put them with the backing on in the serving tray. It's difficult to peal the meals off of the tray to reuse and change otherwise. I'm glad I bought the ""lunch lady""."
2,magellan lakes usa north software,this product is not nearly as useful as navionics. Magellan is not compatible with navionics so this was my only choice. I will most likely not buy another magellan product until they have opened the doors with some other software companies....
2,Music for Tourists,"If you are looking for some portuguese music for tourists, perhaps this will be a good choice: well known cuts, good orchestra... However, if what you are looking for is the traditional portuguese ""fado"", forget this album. This is NOT the Heart of Portugal."
4,Azteca- Where have I been????,"I just recently got this album, being a huge fan of the early Santana albums (Santana I through Caravanserai), I recently ordered this CD and was blown away. This album I would say is a mix between the percussion and horn bombast of Santana III and the jazz/fusion explorations of Caravanserai. Some great playing by all musicians involved, I am very impressed with this album. So my question is, where is the recognition for this band??? Why have I just heard about them now?? Its a shame that the music business causes bands like this to become relatively unknown.Now I am looking forward to hearing their second album, but I guess I will have to get it in vinyl for now!"
3,"Hole in the Sky, A memoir, by William Kittridge","I bought this book because I live in Eastern Oregon and was eager to read a memoir of someone with literary skills and a regional ranching background. What I got was very satisfying writing, and an insight into agri-business. What I didn't like was the anxiety ridden, self-deprecating, mostly negative tone and typical alcoholic blaming of everyone else for one's shortcomings. In his defense, he was born into an era when male writers were influenced by others who were romanticized as self-obsessed and notorious drunks. Their literary license was seen as more important than the welfare of their loved ones. I kept waiting for him to ""get it."" He never did."
3,"Pretty, but Not for Me","From the online photo I thought this bracelet would be red and black. The one I received was dark, reddish brown and dark brown. It really is very pretty, but didn't go with anything in my wardrobe, so I returned it. If you're into wearing fall colors I think you'll like this. The beads were uniform in size and color."
4,Great performance of Tchaikovsky piano concerto,"This is a well-played recording of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto. Artur Rubinstein's performance is excellent. And the accompainant of the Boston Symphony Orchestra is done well. However, the same cannot be said for the Schumann Piano Concerto. Rubinstein's playing sounds tired and worn out. If you bought this CD for the Tchaikovsky concerto, then you did very well."
4,A change of direction for the Great JT,"Like most of JT's work, this album contains easy listening soft rock. It marked a change of direction for JT in that it lacks the introspective, personal quality of his earlier albums. Still, it contains some very good music, backed up by some of the greatest musicians around, including Graham Nash, David Crosby, Carly Simon, Randy Newman, and saxophone master David Sanbourn. Like always, it has JT's beautifully sweet voice and laid back six string accoustic guitar.Several classic hits came out of the album including the ""Mexico"" and ""How Sweet it is to be Loved by You."" Like much of JTs work, it reminds me of the easy comfort of waking up to diffuse sunlight on a Sunday morning."
5,Stephen Hurren from London (UK),"Yes, I agree too about this album becoming so good. Although ""Mexico"" & ""How sweet it is"" are already on his Greatest Hits albums, my other favourites of JT's songs which arenot included on greatest hits albums are ""Music"", ""Wandering"",& ""Sarah Maria"". I also think that there should be a double greatest hits album by James Taylor to be released in the future,featuring just the stuff from his Warner Brothers years. Basically, each CD featuring 20 tracks or more, so that those three favourites of mine are included on it aswell. ""Music"" was what I saw James perform when I went to see him in conert for the first time. James usually performs ""Wandering"" in most of his concerts too. I'll probably send some more thoughts about this album after I keep reading the information about it fromother people on this website."
3,OK,Good for copywriters. It is literally just a book full of different types of words and phrases. Not really an exciting read but I guess if you're searching for a certain phrase this might help.
2,Not what I expected,"This book is more of a thesaurus of sorts, not what i was expecting. I had no trouble returning this"
1,Not as useful as I had hoped,"I bought this along withWords that Sell: More than 6000 Entries to Help You Promote Your Products, Services, and Ideas, and while this one is slightly better than the first, it still isn't what I expected it to be. It turns out that this is a pretty limited poor man's version of a sales thesaurus. I suppose if your primary job is something other than writing sales letters or creating brochures, this can get the juices flowing. But I write marketing copy for a living, and when I get stuck, I find better results just by asking over the cubical wall, ""What's another word for ________?"""
2,Little in the way of use,Words are catalogued under headings and then presented as a simple list.Little infomation on how to use the word in context.Mainly aimed to non-internet usage as well.
2,could be better,"I bought this phone back in Oct.06 from cingular during their promo for this phone. I do like the size and compact feature of this phone. Nevertheless,performance is terrible. Callers on the other end complain that they hear static when talking to me. Reception is also poor with this phone. Why can't they make a phone that actually works when you use it. Don't bother with phone."
1,Can not rely on this phone,"I needed to make an emergency call and got the dreaded Insert Sim Card message. Took phone to Cingular and they said I had the correct SIM card. Their only suggestion was to mail the phone back and get a new C417. Seems unlikely this will solve the problem as others are reporting same problem. A phone should be reliable in emergencies. Want to be taking out your SIM card and reinserting it in the dark in an emergency? If not, AVOID this phone."
2,Phone has SIM card issues and poor quality,"I've been struggling with my phone for 5 weeks now. I kept getting the infamous ""Insert SIM card"" msg, and voice quality has been terrible. The support people at Cingular had me try 4 (!!!) SIM cards in a row, they did the remote resetting and ""tuning""(yeah right), and it's still acting up.On average, 50% of my calls are ""one way"", and I get many many dropped calls. They're going to send me another c417 (not new, refurbished), which I fully expect to be just as bad, now that I have read all the reviews. To be avoided... (the phone *and* Cingular)"
1,The worst phone I've had,I have bad signal or non at all in places where I used to have signal all the time. A co-worker had the same problem and told her to return before 30 days(wish I had) - Can't change the screen menu. The camera button goes off all the time (badly situated). Not a good ringtone listed. Battery marker will have 3 bars and then none. Can't wait to change it!
1,Lost Business Clients Due to Samsung C417,"I have had the Samsung C417 for ten months, and have experienced ""Insert SIM Card"" problem from day 1. Why did I wait 10 months to do something about it? got me. When this message appears, I cannot make nor receive calls. I must power down and up the phone to clear the SIM error message. After finally reaching me, Clients have told me they had called my phone, but there was no indication of such calls on my C417 phone. Lost business clients is NOT a good thing. I do hope Samsung has fixed this problem by now. If your phone is under warranty, you can call (800)801 1101 to get a ""warranty replacement"" phone at no cost. Good luck."
1,Avoid this phone like the PLAGUE,"There are very few positive things about this phone. And what pros exist are very VERY quickly outweighed by the ""INSERT SIM"" messages I got constantly (at least once a day on each phone) on Both phones I had. Yes, the messages kept recurring on mine AND my daughter's original phones so we replaced BOTH of them (through cingular) and now BOTH of the replacements are coming up with the message as well. Just to clarify, when these messages happen you cannot make or receive calls, the alarms don't work, and there is only a very quiet notification that the message has popped up, meaning that you can be out of communication for hours at a time. Features aside, I need a phone that Works, and this one certainly does Not. There should be a recall - FOUR phones with the exact same manufacturer's defect isn't just a fluke. Please, Please save yourself the hassle that I've been through with this phone and choose something different!"
2,Crappy signal,"So I traded in my Sony-Ericson for the Samsung, and my coverage was cut in half. The phone is slim and light which is great but that is about the extent of it.I was looking for a no frills phone and it had exactly what I wanted a calculator, an alarm, and a plug-in headset, all I need. However, the plug-in headset does not work with your standard headsets like it shows, instead you have to purchase a Cingular headset which is like $25 so that was strike two.Then my husband plugged his phone in and the front screen panel went blank and Cingular told him, you must have dropped it, even though he didn't. The phone kept saying insert SIM, that was easily fixed, apparently it is not capable with the latest Cingular SIM card.The phone has no shortcuts so that you can easily access the functions you utilize most. Hard to navigate in the dark because you can't see the buttons.This phone is below average."
2,Back to Nokia for me,"It only took three days for me to know that this phone wasn't the one for me.PROS: large display screen & thin designCONS: small buttons/large fingers (bad combination), sound quality was awful (hearing every 3rd word makes for a difficult conversation), menu navigation was hard to figure out (and the book was absolutely no help!), and ""insert sim card"" error twice in the week I had the phone.I'm back with Nokia. Ahh."
1,Insert Sims Problem with Samsung C417 Cingular phone,I have now received my second Samsung C417 phone from Cingular that has a problem with the Sims Card. I'm not sure why Cingular is selling a product that does not work with their service. The only option after purchasing this new phone is to take a refurbished phone. Not a very fair practice. Now I know why Cingular is giving them away...4 at a time!
5,"Good phone, great price.","I got this phone three weeks ago from the cingular store. For basic cell phone use, it's perfect. I had none of the reception problems that the other guy who wrote a review is having. The more advanced features like camera and internet aren't great at all, but I dont care - I'm just making phone calls. I made a full review and took pictures of me opening the box and a bunch of the phone, you can see it here: [.....]"
3,Average,"This is a very average phone, at a pretty good price. I've had no issues with it other than with it's reception(it seems as if it take a few moments to get any after being pulled out of my pocket).I was also dissappointed to learn(dispite cingular's advertising)that the only bluetooth items this phone was compatible with are headsets: which means to data transfers from my PC. Oh well.Overall, it was worth the money spent."
4,Decent phone,"Overall this has been a good phone. I love the size and weight of the phone. I have had it for about a month now. I have had a couple things that I have not been as happy with. When a get a busy line, I most times get no busy signal at all or occassionally I get about three beeps that are barely audible. The caller busy display only stays up a couple seconds and is gone by the time I take the phone off my ear and it returns to the original screen. Many times I am unsure if my call has even gone through and I have to redial and look at my screen to see what is going on. At first, I thought it was dropping my calls. I have had a little trouble hearing people that I could hear perfectly fine on my last phone. Other than those two main problems, I would recommend this phone."
1,Insert Sim card error,I got two of these phones a month ago and I'm constantly getting Insert Sim card errors on both of them. I replaced the sim. Still getting errors. The phones are bad and going back ASAP.
5,I LOVE Sweet Valley Senior Year!!!,"This is such a great series. I have all of them so far (1-8), and i'm hooked. Once I pick it up I can't put it down. I can't wait to see what happend between Will and Jessica. Also Jessica and Jeremy and Elizabeth and Conner. So buy this book I promise you will love it."
2,Warning,"I thought this book would be like the Sweet Valley Junior High series, but from the few pages I read here on Amazon.Com, I would not recommend this book. I would consider this book not appropriate for girls...maybe under 12. Maybe this book wasn't meant for younger girls, anyway, but I just thought I should warn Sweet Valley Junior High readers that thought this would be like those books."
3,Get on with it!,Ok so this series is pretty good but am I the only one who is tired of the Connor/Liz story getting dragged on? They like each other and then he gets mad about something and totally ignores her. I think we all know they'll end up together. It's been going on for 9 books so get them together and move on! They seriously need a new storyline.
4,The ups and downs of teen life in California.,"Okay,I like that the teens have made the transition into modern times(read:the biggest tramas in some of the original Sweet Vally High series were Jessica having a hot date and not knowing what to wear).But I am NOT happy with some of the new charecters.I dispise Conner.He's a jerk.So why do all the girls go crazy over him? No one's that good looking.And I really want Jessica to try dating someone after she knows some stats on them.By the way,what has happened to Todd? Elizabeth and him were hot and heavy for so long and now he's lucky to say a sentece in every other book.The series on whole rocks!!! :]"
5,Actually deserves 12 stars but ya know. . . . . .,"I LOVED THIS BOOK! I will start off by saying it kept me in suspense and was a real page turner! You just want to keep reading until you finish. I finished it in an hour the day I got it. I actually don't think Will is that bad a character, he seems sweet. Don't get me wrong, Jeremy and Jess rule, but maybe we could find another sweet girl for Will. Okay, onto the book. Liz and Conner are hardly in it. Jessica and William make this meeting which really isn't a date because Tia was coming, but then Tia backed out at last minute so it seems like a date and Jeremy caught them after Mellissa(YUCK)told him Will made a date with Jess, which wasn't true at the time and now Jeremy and Jess broke up. Whew, long breath, huh?"
4,Very thought provoking,"I bought a set of these cards a couple of years ago. I use them periodically to help me unstick the stuck in my ideas and thoughts.The art work is intriguing (sort of makes you want to create your own set), the words are clear and straight talking - although a few typos are a bit distracting. Perhaps they are cleaned up in the re-printed version.Would I buy them again - yep. Good stuff."
5,For those skeptical of New Age,"This isn't anything like the Tarot or those other decks that purport to tap into the future or anything New Age-y. While this deck has the term ""oracle"" in the title, I think it's more like a way of figuring out what you truly feel/how you are expressing yourself in the present. If you disagree with what you discover, that's equally telling, and equally important, rather than just being ""wrong."" It's more of a tool to better clarify your current state, for better or worse--and for that reason, Antero Alli and Sylvie Pickering deserve 5 stars for their efforts. It's often difficult to self-report.I've used the deck for apparent divination in the past, an action I've now found rather unfulfilling, but I have never left the Vertical Oracle entirely behind because it is so much more than a fortune-telling device. The Vertical is better for surveying the present and the internal--one could say it specializes in helping to turn things around, or keep them on the right track."
3,"Overall Great Show, BUT Terrible Way To End a Series","I have to say, this was my least favorite season of Las Vegas. The plot lines were okay and the show didn't have that same excitement/dynamic like season's 2 and 3 (My favorites out of all of them.I am also upset on how they ended this show. They could of done one more season to close out the loose ends and end the show in a satisfying way.Still a great TV series overall, but last season was blah."
1,Rip Off,Once again the loyal fans of a television series get ripped off! How can you leave a series ending like that with no conclusion??? Just bad business by NBC period.
5,Sorry It's over,"This was a very good DVD, and I just wished that they had not cancelled the series. It was good to see the extras."
2,Las Vegas,"OK, I'm really sorry Jimmy left the series and Tom is hard to get used to. It takes about 4-5 episodes for the characters to gel and get back into a groove. Like the Homicide, Sopranos, NCSI, South Park, and Arrested Development network interference can really screw up a good thing. It seems the shelf live of a good series is about 5 seasons max then the networks start ""tinkering"" with it and just run it into the ground. I hope LV can survive the cast change and uncomfortable story lines. LV used to be a fun action series with lots of T&A, a formula that's worked since the original Charlie's Angles, let it go."
4,Too bad it is the last,"Season 5 of Las Vegas starts out slow, but by the end it is as fun and exciting as the first 4. It is too bad it is the last sean because it ends with a lot of cliff hangers. They should make a movie or something to conclude the series. If you like Las Vegas you will enjoy this season."
4,not so bad,"due to bad reviews, I wasn't expecting much - turned out it was pretty good and that Magnum guy wasn't half bad.Not as good as seasons 2-4, and no closure, but still better than most...."
5,A must read while pregnant!!!!,"I wish I would have read this book while pregnant the first time!!! I recomend this book to all women!!! If fact, it should be required reading for every woman upon getting her period! In the US, we're indoctrinated with horror stories about birth, and Sheri Menelli now brings us the truth. I cannot recomend this book highly enough!!!"
5,This book is a must have for all moms and moms to be!,"Sheri Menelli has done an outstanding job of compiling a collection of beautiful and inspiring stories of natural birth. After two natural births of my own, reading this book made me want to go out and do it all over again! I am so glad there is finally a collection of stories that doesn't fill the reader with terror of childbirth, like many birth stories do. This is a great book for moms-to-be because it shows the true beauty of childbirth. It would make a great baby shower gift. Thank you, Sheri!"
3,Dog Treat Cookie Cutter oh so tiny!,"The kit was very simple and the kids enjoyed doing it. However, the picture on the box and website makes the dog treats appear large. In reality the dog bone cookie cutter is only one inch long and about 1/2 inch wide. It is so tiny! We have two large dogs, so the treats were kind of a joke!"
5,Larry Graham still doin' his thang,I was shocked when I found out that Larry Graham wasn't with the Family Stone anymore. But even on his own he did his thang. My dad burned this album for me. I loved it. The song Ain't No Fun To Me makes a lot of sense if you hear it. And Hair is my favorite because it's the same saying as don't judge a book by it's cover. And the song is saying it's not right to judge somebody by their hair. The Jam introduces everybody. Even Larry wrote songs about society like Sly. You can't go wrong with buying this album. And if you're a fan of Sly and the Family Stone then I recommend Graham Central Station. This is a really good group and album.
4,With different lyrics this would rock,"Musically this album is great. I bought this after hearing Larry Graham's excellent work on Sly Stone's ""Riot"". I thought song 2 and 3 kicked [...], as the grooves keep changing and Tower of Power horns add so much to the arrangements. Also interesting is the evidence of Sly's influence, and the presence of drum machine (used extensively by Sly on ""Riot""). But the album is a little hampered by lyrics that are not too interesting, and yes, dated. I guess you can't fault Larry for that given the period and audience he was going for. However the music is great throughout, and his bass playing never disappoints. Also a nice surprise is that Larry is a great singer. I understand this album broke lots of ground but listening to it I feel a little embarrased because the message is now a little passe. Historically significant but nothing you'd be listening too over and over unless you grew up with it."
2,slides,"This wheel chock works great on a level concrete or level asphalt. When used on a slope, they slide before ""digging in"" to hold the wheel. Having a trailer move while uncoupling from the pickup is not a very confortable feeling."
5,blood feud,I agree Sheriff Potts was an extrdinary man and sheriff in his relentless pursuit of Wallace. The author left out or didnt know that Sheriff Potts was related by blood to William Turner. An old fashion blood feud sub plot. Must read on many levels. ECT
5,"A chilling witness to old Southern justice,hate & murder","A true and horrifying story of old Southern arrogance backed by a brutal sheriff. These men don't discriminate when it comes to killing, nor do they hide in the shadows. I was sickened at the way they brutally beat the young white man to death. This book is not about killing people of color, it's about killing anyone that violates their way of life, such as it is. They kill because they can, and only a fool with a death wish would challenge them. This book documents the 1940's and 50's South with all of it's horror stories. How can one man in a small dusty town become so arrogant and above the law? You have to read this book to believe that it really happened. I still shake my head on occasion with a knot in my belly. I've always heard that you should never travel through the South alone. This book explains why..... JJR, M.A."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,If you already have Schildt's Windows 95 Programming in C and C++ you've got all you need. Herbert wrote the same book with another name
5,Very funny!,"Mike Warnke is a great comedian. This is one of the funniest cds that I have heard, but he also speaks about serious things quite well. Great cd! I highly recommend it!"
3,S......L.......O.......W to write but read is great,"I'm using the viking 256MB for a Palm T|T. It takes for ever to write such a 1MB file will take over 5 minutes. I've had to cancel saving MP3 files (~5MB) on the card since I couldn't wait after 10 minutes. You get what you pay for. However, I gave it an average rating since the reading capability is definitely faster. So if cost is a factor and you don't mind waiting then get this before the rebate is over."
4,"Good price, works fine so far","Works well with my Kodak DX3700 digital camera.The only problem was when I tried it in the very first time, a message popped up telling me to format the card, so I tried to format it and it said formatting failed. But then the second time I turned the camera on, it worked just like nothing ever went wrong in the first place.I am happy that for a relatively low price, I can take about 255 pictures at highest resolution.I do not notice any speed problems."
1,Afraid it's true,"I was not deterred by the previous reviewers' comments here; they mostly referred to shipping times being poor, not on the quality of the unit itself. The other critique was that it wasn't a full 256MB, which is true, but is also the case with all ""256MB"" SD cards.Having had good experiences with Viking CF cards, I decided to chance it. Got my card quickly (from another reseller); unfortunately, the card was DOA (defective on arrival). Writing data to the card was extremely slow, and would generate many, MANY write errors when sending it large files. What's the point of getting a 256MB card if you can't write large files to it? So, I returned the Viking card and got a Lexar 256MB SD card instead & it works great.Maybe I just got a rare, defective card, but I'm not brave enough to waste anymore time on it. So, though, I didn't agree with the previous reviewers' reasons for rating this card so low, they did get the ranking right."
1,Sandisk Card in disguise,I bought this card for my wife's palm Zire 71 and my plam tungsten C thinking Viking made it since my first 64MB Viking card has never had a problem. It turns out Sandisk makes their 256MB cards. I have corrupted 3 Sandisk 256MB in 2 wks. I did this by writing with the sandisk card reader and the viking card reader. 1 of the three cards can no longer be formatted to recover it. I went to the Sandisk site for help on what I was doing wrong and they have a list of things that can cause corruption to these cards. One cause can be writing any file too quickly to the card. Sandisk's solution is to reformat the card and start over. What good is using these cards if you can't trust the integrity.
3,S ... L ... O ... W ... !,"As others have mentioned, this ... card ... is ... slow! I had two 128MB cards (Lexar and SanDisk) before, and both read/wrote much faster with my Palm Tungsten|T than this card. A backup operation, for example, which took about 2 minutes to write to my old 128MB card took about 5 minutes with this card. The total size of files being backed up is about 13MB. Someone mentioned 5 - 10 seconds to write a 5MB file in another review; I have seen nothing CLOSE to that speed.I don't know if there are faster 256MB cards, but it may be worth checking out before buying this card."
3,Good card ... but slow !!,I bought this card for my dell pocket PC. This card along with its mailing rebate (which I got within a resonable time) was the best deal out there. There does not seem to be any realiability problems with this card but it is really really slow. It takes ages for me to transfer mp3 files to this card from my PC. Its so slow that I have stopped transferring files!So I would suggest that this card not be used with any device which benefits from fast data transfers.
3,UPC Code wasn't included so no rebate,"I ordered one of these and was going to send in for the rebate making this card a great deal but when Amazon shipped the card it came in a plain cardboard box with no vendor packaging. Therefore, I couldn't send in the required UPC code to get the rebate. The card isn't that good a deal without the rebate. Others are less expensive and better quality."
2,"Works, but it's slow","This unit is a re-packaged SanDisk SD card. Bear this in mind as you search the net for benchmarks that compare the relative speed of various SD cards.In my Palm Tungsten T, the card performs very poorly, particularly on writes. This is mainly based on results from the VFSmark application (freeware).This may not be the case for other uses of the card, but I'd still be wary."
3,Good Product,"This a good product, but I have a little problem when I want to take out the card from the camera, sometimes stocked in the slot."
4,no problem,Name brand is not necessary. Was very happy with card. Works fine with camera-Cannon A510 Powershot. Pictures came out great.
5,great value for the price,"The $12 rebate on this product made it an incredible buy. What's more, it only took three weeks for me to receive the rebate!"
1,Shipping and handling.,The chare for shipping and handling of this small item was RIDICULOUS! I would have been better off buying at a Retail Store.
1,Mine was DOA,"Judging by other reviews here, there is a real quality problem with this card. Mine was no exception. Tried it in two different card readers. Neither would recognize the card. Couldn't reformat. No help on Viking website so tried Sandisk which others are claiming really makes this card. Tried their troubleshooting tips to no avail. I am an experienced PC user - this product is junk. Spend a few more dollars and avoid wasting time. I wish I could give this product zero stars but the one star can be for Amazon.com's good return policy."
1,Laughable at Best,"This ""text"" is at best a simplistic attempt to subject an opinion of one person with no factual basis upon the masses. The author took no time to research or list references of where his ""information"" came from. If you would like a good laugh, buy this book. If you are looking for something serious....avoid this by all means!"
3,"Worthwhile, but not Coogan's Best Work","Coogan's books are always written in a style that makes for easy reading; this is no exception. If written for his own newspaper, however, Coogan (the editor) might have wondered at some of the errors. The sections on the less known of Irish diaspora settlements were excellent. Coogan's personal contacts and varied and numerous acquaintances enliven all of his work and are evident throughout this book. Any lover of things Irish will enjoy the read."
1,Really people??,I can not believe the 4 and 5 star ratings for this record. This is awful and should have a warning sticker saying how bad is sucks.
2,sophomore slump,"Ronnie Montrose had a heavy metal classic with his first album; so what was the logical next move? Evidently, turn down the guitars, add synthesizers, and put some boring slow ballads into the mix. What could have been a monster 70's act instead quickly (and deservedly) faded into obscurity. I recently bought the CD to see if it was as disappointing as I remember it back in '77. It was."
2,Decent book that doesn't really cover writing for the web.,I purchased this book with the intention of improving my ability to write for the internet. I was disapointed to discover there was very little coverage of writing copy for the web. Much of the book covered outdated search engine optimization techniques. Avoid this book if you want to learn how to write online copy.
5,"Witty, Practical, Educational","I'm about half-way through the book and love it! It's filled with practical advice that those responsible for Web content or design can put to use immediately. After a few hours, I have a checklist of changes I need to make to the site I manage. I also appreciate the author's witty style, which makes the book enjoyable as well as educational."
2,Dont waste your time,This book really is not a web savvy guide to writing web content. Do no believe the title.
3,Nice to watch but should have rented it,"This is an old documentary of russian folk song and dance. It was enjoyable but not something we will want to watch over and over again. For the price, I shoud have rented it once."
2,A Disapointment,"I expected some of the spectacular, athletic dancing we usually associate with Russian folk dancing; however, there were only a few such performances. Most of the singing/dancing was slower paced, low skill level, and, to my taste, quite boring. It was interesting to realize the broad multi-ethnic spectrum that Russia encompasses, but each performance was repetitive and dragged on too long. Tony Randall's narration was no help."
5,Help and healing for the homosexul,This book is the best I have read on the subject. It is from a very compassionate perspective but with the purpose of recovery and has excellent information.
5,From Brokeness to Wholeness,Self awareness that leads to freedom. Courage is one of the most needed aspects in coming to the reality that homosexual practice is a manifestation of seeking for wholeness. The journey of wholeness is a journey not to be taken alone. Every person who seeks wholeness needs to be in a community that will love you into the presence of Jesus. Honest hope and great insights are the foundation of this book. Hope is here in Jesus and His body!
2,I've read better..,I've read several books in this series and this one is the poorest. The others were good. The other books are better.
1,I whole-heartedly agree,"I completely agree with Mr. Attig about there being no need for this book. If you truly are gay, which is a reality for millions of people, you don't need spiritual healing, let alone when it comes from a book to know that whatever path you choose is your own path, and should be respected by everyone. This book is unnecessary and should only be bought if you're insecure. ""We have just enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another,"" said Jonathan Swift, which is obviously demonstrated by this book, which is derogatory and offensive to gays and lesbians, because it says that what they stand for does not exist. Those who agree with me, speak up, because this book should most certainly not be in print."
3,"greedy marketplace sellers, time to bite off your fingers","yes, great news brave new world, this box has just been reissued by RCA/Sony in a budget-priced box,Leopold Stokowski: The Stereo Collection 1954-1975, selling for just a little over 30 when I wrote this review, already 45 two weeks later (some happy buyers must have quickly taken advantage of the cheapest marketplace offers), but still, 14 CDs, a bargain compared to what marketplace sellers are demanding for the original box from 1997. See my review of the reissue with the complete contents, links to the individual discs comprising this earlier reissue, and additional discographic information."
3,Worth picking up USED if you can find it!,"Picture an outstretched thumb pointing sideways: neither thumbs-up, nor thumbs-down. Congratulations, you've just imagined exactly how I responded to this book. I've had it for years, and it's worth hunting down, the neo-feminist movement considers it required ""reading"". So get out there and scare up copies for your pride-filled women! Let's Unite."
1,yaaaawwn!,"Just another boring early Sweet Valley High book,Kristin Thomas is overrun by her heavy tennis schedule.I suppose it is mildly enjoyable."
1,Requires On-site consultant and training - Difficult Product,"This is a confusing product to use and has problems with synchronization. There are too many alternatives that are better including online ASP CRM products and even free CRM products online. The product is build on dbase and requires rebuilding periodically. Has lots of features which makes it very difficult to learn. You will spend more time trying to get this product to work, rather than selling."
3,Not as advertised,"The product claimed to be ""brand new in original packaging"". It was not.When received, the box had been opened, the CD envelope opened, the CD has scratches on it and the box was crushed.Not from s shipping problem, as it was inside another box.Fortunately the CD installed properly."
4,Canvas Paper,Printed photo's to display and I was pleased with the textured of the paper and it's ability to print perfect color.
2,Finally gave up trying to use it ( jams printer ),"Having tried two different boxes of this, I finally gave up on it as I simply could not get it to feed through my printer w/o jamming up and munging the canvas ( Cannon PIXMA pro 9000 ). Both boxes of paper had sheets that curl on the edges. It's a shame because the quality of prints -- especially darks -- was great on this paper."
3,Mixed feelings,"The quality of the paper is very nice. However, I discovered it jams one of my printers. It works best in a printer with a straight paper path. On the canvas side of the paper, the colors came out muddy. On the opposite side, they are crisp and beautiful. I have to experiment more with it to get the colors to look good on the canvas side. Coverage with other brands was perfect. Don't know if it's my printer or the paper. I think it will be trial and error."
3,OK product,The product is OK. It is not as rich as it could be. I don't notice significant reduction in wrinkles. I think it keeps my skin the same and not any better than before.
4,Best prices on Star Wars toys,My son loves anything star wars. Amazon has better prices and more selection than Toys R Us or any of the discount stores. He now loves shopping at Amazon!
5,Fun weekend read,One man's trials of the PGA golf tour. Lots of fun and even so to a newbie in golf like me.
5,Excellent Read,"I am a Senior golfer and this book was recommended to me by another golfer. The book was excellent and, of course, James Patterson is an outstanding author. I was delighted with the story and thrilled with the miracle that happened on the 17th green."
5,Five Stars,"James Patterson smashes it out of the park again. Whether you are a golfer or not, this story relates to all who feel like life is crashing in around us. James Patterson does a great job of taking us on a journey through this characters struggle with forced change and how he struggles to make life's changes, make sense.Through each round of golf becomes another hurdle cleared and the fighting effort of a man who tries to make his life make sense. I think we can all relate with feeling like our work life and our personal lives are out of control, how we relate with getting back into the drivers seat and taking control of the wheel.This is a wonderful story that keeps you turning each page until the end, the miracle. Not too cheesy and a quick read!"
1,What a disappointing book!,"This was the most boring I read in a long long time. What a drag! I wish I could give it zero star.It is painful to read, especially if you are not a golf fan: the book goes in so much detail into golf that it makes it even more boring. Who cares about his scores?And where is the miracle? The miracle is that this book was published and that some people were roped into buying it.I could not wait until I was finished reading it. What a waste!!"
2,Disappointed...,"I am usually a fan of James Patterson's books, but really did not enjoy this one. It is an easy, fast read, but just didn't grab my attention. I also think the cost of the book is a bit much for a book that has less than 200 pages and that includes many, many blank pages."
2,Trite,"While it was a light and quick read, Miracle on the 17th Green is very predictable and formulatic. Appreciate what you have or you will lose it. Don't be afraid to succeed. Beyond that, I found very few life revelations or insights. I love golf, and golf books, but I could not rate this one even in the top 10 of the golf books I have read.One item that really didn't ring true was that a course in the Chicago area is pretty unlikely to have real pins on the actual greens at Christmas. I live in MA, and our greens are always covered and blocked off by Thanksgiving at the latest. I realize that doesn't affect the essence of the story or message, but it bothered me."
2,Not James Patterson's best,I was disappointed with this book. I have read his books like Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and Sam's Letters to Jennifer before. And I thought this book would be of the same quality but it wasn't. I got thru the whole book but it didn't give me the feeling that I couldn't put it down.
2,Disappointed,Not a big fan of this book. I usually can't put a James Patterson book down but this one took me a while to get into!
2,"If you don't like golf, don't read this","I love James Patterson. I've never read a book of his that I didn't love, and even his non-mystery books are amazing. But I could not love this book. It's all about golf, and some middle aged man who hates his life and miraculously starts to play amazing golf. The plot is dull and predictable and the best thing about the book is that it is at least well written.But I don't like golf at all, in fact I find it to be horribly boring and don't even like mini golf, so to muddle through all these golf terms and descriptions of the course and which club he's using was torture for me. It's a very short book but I ended up skimming the second half of it after I realized that yes, it really is all about golf.So if you're into golf, you'll probably like this book. But if you're like me and just wanted to read another one of James Patterson's books but have zero interest in golf - skip this one."
5,A Feel-Good Tale About Life,"You don't have to like golf to enjoy this feel-good tale that is a small slice of The American Dream. A real departure for James Patterson, but his snappy sequences shine through this one...a great gift for Dad!"
3,Just Okay,"I am a huge fan of James Patterson but I would say this was not one of my favorites. It was okay but not great. If you are a golfer, I'm sure you will like it."
1,Maybe I Just Don't Get It,"I found this to be a very unsatisfactory read. It was predictable and did not inspire any sense in me of caring about the characters. Thankfully it was short, although perhaps its brevity is what prevented the plot and characters being developed sufficiently. At any rate, my reaction after reading it was essentially, ""so what?"""
2,"Trite, Lame and Predictable","Even an avid golfer will find this a tedious read. The plot is contrived and predictable. The humor is sophomoric at best. It is blessedly short but I'd rather play the worst muni in the world than re-read this book. The only reason I finished it the first time was because I couldn't believe it could grow steadily worse from page to page. If your golfer has any education at all, buy him or her a P.G. Wodehouse book instead: The Heart of a Goof or The Clicking of Cuthbert."
4,A 'feel good' book with a life lesson...,"In my quest to read all of James Patterson's books, I stumbled across this one in a bargin book store. This book is not the murder mystery he is known for - it's more like SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICOLAS.MIRACLE ON THE 17TH GREEN is set around golf - but don't worry about really understanding or having an appreciation of the game to read this book. This is a story about Travis McKinley who discovers he is not happy with his life and decides to make changes...starting with his job. The short story (only 150 pages) told in James Patterson style (short chapters) begins on one Christmas when Travis golfs the game of his life. From there his life begins to change - for the better. He discovers during the next year what really matters to him and his life takes on a clarity it has never had.A good book that proves Patterson can write a good story no matter what the subject!"
4,A Good Listen,Just listened to the audio version and really enjoyed it. Most of the positive reviews got it right on. I would have to say that it would probably help if you had a working novel of the game of golf. The narrator did a good job with both voice inflection and reading different characters.
4,golfer's dream.....,The book was a fast read and very entertaining - this is every golfer's dream...
4,Useful and Fun,Not only is this a useful phrasebook but tons of fun! The phrases cover most subjects but the book is not big to throw in a suitcase. A great gift for all your gay friends.
3,Fun but Limited,"I really do enjoy this little phrasebook, whether I'm considering travel or just learning to say something for fun. The book has a decent scope of topics that revolve around gay life, but it does seriously lack in many of the other basics. One would still need a second phrasebook to deal with most other aspects of travel.For entertainment value alone, you'll probably love this cute text. If you travel, you're sure to add color to your parlance in any of these eight languages."
3,"Amusing if you like Go, but otherwise pass on it","A fascinating read from another age and culture. I'm not sure if it will carry the same weight if the reader is not a Go player or interested in Japanese/Asian culture. However, for those that are this book contains the struggle of the retirement match of the then master of Go. The game goes on for several months during which the battlefield is carried into many mental arenas besides the board as the players have spats about conditions and terms. It ends poignantly with a later meeting between the master and reporter. The master dies during the night leaving the reporter in a dejected state, wondering if he should have accepted the dinner invitation."
5,"Beautiful, sturdy and well designed!","This is a very nice bird cage that is both well built and beautiful!It arrived way ahead of schedule, sent by XTREME CAGES who sold it at a price that is unbelievably low! It was also very easy to assemble! THANK YOU!"
3,Bird Cage,"Metal is definitely solid, directions are terrible, 1 picture recopied a million times. It is nice but I would like to see some way to fasten the top cage part to the bottom.It sits inside the bottom tray,sides hook together. It is big.Slots on perchs are too big, they slide around on the sides.Overall I am satisfied and so is my bird. (He thinks it's some sort of castle!)"
4,An excellent starting point,This is an excellent overview on leadership development and is a great starting point for further reading. Anyone who's taken a course at CCL will recognize the techniques referred to in the first half of the book especially the description of Feedback Intensive Programs.Keep in mind that this is an overview and no topic is dealt with in great detail. This should provide a good foundation for exploring topics in more detail. I found the section on cross cultural differences very enlightening and am encouraged to read more on the topic.This is not just for OD professionals but for anyone with an interest in leadership.
4,Shiver My Timbers,I bought this CD specifically for the Treasure Island Sound track. This Treasure Island sound track is for a version of Treasure island made in the early 90's staring Christian Baile and Charelton Heston. If you have this CD and love the music go and buy the Treasure Island movie too.
4,haynes is good,"i've used haynes almost exclusively starting with my dodge dakota, then subaru, honda accord, and i'll buy and use another for my dodge ramcharger. better for the home mechanic with no training - these books actually follow the service manuals for the vehicle. chiltons might do for the semi-trained mechanic, but i find hard to follow. no book will be perfect - this helps a half way smart home mechanic the best."

2,"Good Value, Bad Smell",This is really inexpensive so I ordered it for our business. Unfortunately it has an unappealing medicinal smell. It was so overwhelmingly chemically I had to wash it off my arms and it gave me a little bit of a headache. One of the bottles also arrived open.
3,Not Impressed.,"I got this bottle of lotion for 3 or so dollars at the Dollar General. After all the positive reviews I read on it I figured I'd give it a try. Now, I don't have extremely dry skin. Just every now and then the skin on my legs feels a little dry and itchy. I was hoping this would be my remedy. Not so. First of all, this product does not have a very pleasent smell. It smells very chemical. Second of all, this product provides little to no moisture or relief to the skin. My skin felt moisturized and less itchy for maybe 2 minutes? I would buy a bottle of St. Ive's or SEACRET any day over this."
5,Good stuff!,"This is really good stuff. It is smooth and leaves a rather silky feel like more expensive hand creams. The size is convenient to drop in your pocket! I first discovered it in Seattle, and finally found it again at a Rite-Aid drugstore in the Pittsburgh airport! It retails for $1 per tube, and I buy ten at a time. But the shipping, if you had to pay it, would make it prohibitively expensive. Try your local Rite-Aid, or visit Pittsburgh! But DO try this cream. It's nice."
3,I want my cocoa smell back!,"this used to clearly be my favorite lotion, BUT it no longer has the pleasant smell of cocoa w/ a hint of vanilla. some new, hard to identify, ""chemical"" smell now predominates--and it's not a fragrance i like.maybe they started putting in less cocoa butter (cocoa beans are now costlier)and added this off-putting fragrance as some kind of artificial cocoa smell. it's a wrong move; the lotion doesn't smell nice.keep the lotion's formula like it was in the past. if you have to charge more, then so be it; it's not like it's expensive already."
1,BAD If you suffer from acne.,"Yes this is ultra-hydrating and some people think it is a great moisturizer. I am here to tell you that if you suffer from acne, this will make it more worse than you can imagine! I speak from experience, and have researched this as well. Although this product is water based, it still contains oil and because it absorbs so quickly-it stays in system for a while. Even if you don't use this on your face it can cause you to break out because it does not completely wash off your hands even when you are washing your face. It is a very fine oil that can clog pores and add oil very quickly and easily.It is a great price, and for individuals with resistant non-acne prone skin I am sure this product is wonderful. For the rest of us, do not let the fact that this is water based and all natural fool you!"
2,Smells absolutely disgusting! YUCK!,"The bad news about this lotion is it reeks. I cannot tell you what on earth the smell is, but it smells so bad. I cannot tell if it is a chemical smell, or what? It smells like rubber crossed with a barnyard, or something. It's too bad, because it DOES make my skin soft. But, I cannot handle the smell. I'd rather use a product that works half as good but smells really good. This is nasty."
4,Very good book about Jamaican music!,"This piece is quite awesome, it has good back story about the Jamaican history of music and it got a CD with 30+ songs you can play to. I wish they were a little bit longer but I guess it would make it 2 or 3 CD's for each book. The recordings are very good and accurate to the originals too.The notes and tablature are easy to understand for a beginner and the level of difficulty are different to very easy to hard to learn which is good if you want to go further in your development to play bass."
5,Fun,With this book Ed Friedland covers the basics and origins of the reggae tunes and sound.It is fun to do the exercises according ones ability and you get a good taste of the music. Some fingerings are quite hard and practise is required. The rythms can also be challenging but this leads to more in depth understanding of the material in the book. All in all I'm happy and satisfied buying the book.
2,Ummm....leave it.,"I got lost. I had absolutely no idea what was going on. Some priest left his house, came home to a house that did...or didn't (one of the parts that lost me) have LIVING people in it, and overall, I think I was as confused as he was. I honestly gave up on this after trying to get somewhere in it for three weeks. The storyline..if there is one..isn't worth following. Try Rawn, Jordan, Friedman, or the Deathgate Cycle."
5,THE BOOK on Easter Island,"You would think from the title that this is book is actually a flaming, guilt-ridden treatise on environmentalism. But such is not the case. It is in reality a well balanced handling of all aspects of Easter Island. Yes, Thor Heyerdahl and his theories are covered but so is going on vacation there and where to stay. If there is something you would like to know about Easter Island, this book probably covers it in a most readable fashion."
4,The Ravagaing of Rapa Nui,"Helped me understand the wider implications of the civilisation's actions in their little microcosm.Demystifies and explains the rise and fall of the once great (albeit small) Rapa Nui community that once inhabited Easter Island by explaining, through forensic and historical research, the destruction they reaped on themselves."
4,Exactly what I expected. Great Portable Fun.,"This game is exactly what I would expect from a game titled Sim City 2000 -- especially when on such a small console as GameBoy Advance.The graphics and gameplay are very much like the original PC version of Sim City 2000.Even some of the game flaws are the same (with it not letting you build where a power line is already -- instead you have to do power lines last. This inconvenience was corrected in later PC versions).As others stated, if you only have green or blue squares -- it is not the game -- it is YOU not reading the directions and/or playing correctly.Power may not be hooked up... it may still be on pause... etc.This game is exactly what I hoped it would be. And exactly what I would expect from a game console I can put in my pocket.If you want more graphics and power -- you shouldn't be using a GameBoy Advance (which is, basically, a teeny Super Nintendo)."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"As a big fan of the PC (and event Super Nintendo version), I was so excited to get this game. But, it turns out that it wasn't worth the money. The parred down controls make it very boring after awhile - no subways or waterpipes to put in. They are missing a lot of the little detail such as the cars, etc. And, it's very complicated to lay streets and stuff in the direction you want or to scroll around to see your city. Don't bother with this one."
4,very fun,this is one of those games that never gets old. if your ever bored like me siting in a study hall with nothing to do or if your siting at home this is for you. this game was fun enough were people would sit on the computer and play it for hours. plus the cheap price and good graphics make have to have it. don't think the graphics are like the super nintendos version because they look just like on the computer. ive seen screen shots and they look clean and crisp. You also never have to wory about a slow computer either and it has all the same features as the computer version did. never ending replay value and never ending tasks make this a need to own game for your collection.
1,The Sims are fun- Just not this one.,"I reccomend the sims buting out or the urbz. its very hard to get money and you'll have to know what industral, commercial, and industerial- boring. This is supposed to be a game... not homework. I'm her daughter, by the way."
1,I Expected ALOT MORE,"This game sucks I Havent even bought this game but my cousin did and when he came over I tried it, Its THE crappiest game ever. When ever you have a fire in your city you can only put a limited amount of firefighters on the scene(about 10)and when an alien attacks your town (how stupid is that!) You can only put about 8 firefighters and cops are limited to!+ You start with about 15000 (not alot)"
2,Shall I compare SimCity 2000 on GBA to a summer's day ? NO!!,"This game is bull. I give almost all my games some sympathy (see Hulk on GBA review ""Show Me the Green""- that game rocks!!) but not this one. This is the worst excuse for a Maxis game on this planet. (I love all Sim games except this one.) All you do is build a city, but unlike other Sim games, you get no cash, so within three game years you're impeached or your city is in ruins. It's very impossible to lead a succesful city in this game. Even the scenarios start out with something bad happening. The only use for this stinking game is to throw it on the wall or take it apart and see what is inside the cartridge. Places like Wal-Mart jack up the price saying it is an amazing game. I got it for about $39.99, which the cashier said was mostly giving it away, compared to how famous it is. It sucks, mostly - that's what I've been saying for this whole thing. A review by Ben9er - they won't let kids have review names."
4,Terrible,The worst game i ever played on the back it shows these tall buildings and even when i zoom in the buildings are blue and green squares. i hate this game. The only thing i liked was destroying the town (because it was so stupid).
1,The wost game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!,All you do is make a city and then it gets demmalished in someway!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Fun game despite it's limits,Despite that it came out a few years ago it's still a fun game to play for GBA Despite it's limits you have to understand what hardware the GBA has which is an advanced 32bit version of the SNES hardware which is still more powerful then all the hardware combined that sent the space shuttles to the Moon so lets not gripe on the hardware side but this version of Sim City plays ok but i would not give it to the kids they might get frustrated i am 26 years old and had a time with it at first till i got use to the controls i rank it with Sim City DS which i also give a 4star rating over all good to have in your collection if you like the Sim City games and not the crappy Sim series of games
4,Great fun but only if management games are your thing,"According to an earlier review, ""The worst game i ever played, on the back it shows these tall buildings and even when i zoom in the buildings are blue and green squares. i hate this game. The only thing i liked was destroying the town (because it was so stupid).""As a matter of fact the game will look exactly like the pictures on the back provided that you build roads and a power grid. When you first allocate land for residential, commercial or industrial usage all you get is the coloured squares. Whack in a power station and transit and you're away. Buildings will sprout up.Anyway, that aside, this is basically the more simplified Sim City 1 concept but with graphics ported over from the PC Sim City 2000. It's not a straight port (nothing like as complex) but it's good hand-held entertainment and you get the warm glow of wielding power over a whole bunch of Sims on the bus/train etc. Top notch."
4,Good - but not that Good,This game looks great on the GBA but it gets a little frustrating trying to run your SIM CITY with the GBA controls. Though this game still gets addicting expect frustration with getting use to the controls.
3,Pretty Good,"Hard, and sometimes frustrating, but still kind of fun. PC versions are much better, like Sim City 4 Deluxe. This is for only select people who like this kind of game. Features aren't great and it has confusing and hard controls. The idea is good but it could be better.By the way, SimCity 4 Deluxe is one of the best PC games ever."
2,STICK WITH THE COMPUTER!,"Ok this one was ok but it takes along time to scroll and where have the cars gone? Very tedious disasters such as the earthquake, screen shakes a little and that's it! ANd no highways or signs, and when you build things it gets this stupid ""Loding"" screen and what the heck where they trying to tell with the bumble bee? Also there is not much fun in it and the menu music sucks. Take a PC or Mac version of this, they are much better."
1,Not worth the money!,This Game is glitchy and slow making movement of the camera very hard. Wierd controls and layout. Not nearly as good as the origanal!
5,"Excellent Resource, Especially for the Price","C.S. Lewis has long been my favorite author because of his lucid interpretation of what Christianity is all about (Mere Christianity), the Problem of Evil (Problem of Pain), bereavement (A Grief Observed), etc. I have over 40 books by Lewis and I would regard this one as one of the most valuable, for it sheds light on many of Lewis's views through a plethora of witty essays. This book is also very reasonably priced and quite meaty. Every essay is thought-provoking. This is a wonderful book for one who wants to get a handle on what Lewis believed (in regards to philosophy, at least). An invaluable book to add to the library for under $15.Daniel"
5,"An insightful little book into the mind of CS Lewis, esp on Christmas",Short little essays provide a lot of value and insight. A must for current theology students to add to their shelf. The audio version is also very good.
5,God in the Dock,This collection of essays is probably the best introduction to the non-fiction works of C.S. Lewis. It provides an intellectual and spiritual challenge to any intelligent reader.
2,"For grooming,not so sure about shedding.","I've used this comb for my cat and she still sheds all over the place.Maybe it's best used for grooming,not so much for shedding."
4,Good Bjork Single...,"Pagan Poetry single 1, is done well, for the Pagan Poetry song and the remix. The remix is good (though little instruments) but a lot of f/x's and a natural atmosphere, making you feel as if Bjork was singing to you at night in a forest. Though the vocal has been screwed up a bit, the rest of the song is very well done. As for Aurora, stick with the original, this one is hardly worth listening to. It contiously repeats 3 guitar chords, way too long, throughout the song. The only attraction of it, is its vocal arrangements.The first songs, are done well and memorable, but yet the lesser attraction sets it back, as so Pagan Poetry Single 1, rates a 4 out if 5"
3,"Always in the right spirit, but sloppy and dated","This set really doesn't hold a candle to the complete Berlioz with Colin Davis on Philips, or to many great readigs of the individual pieces. Despite Munch's reputation, his Berlioz is often hectic and sloppy. The choral work is particularly disappointing, since he had to rely on either the Harvard-Radcliffe or New England Conservatory choruses, there being no professional group in Boston at the time. The highlight of this box is the Romeo and Juliet, one of two recordings Munch made for RCA in Boston, and the overtues are bliazingly done. I also like the L'Enfance du Christ veyr much, and Munch's Symphonie fantastique holds up. But overall the deficits in dated sound make this a valuable historical set rather than a definitive modern one."
4,I read the book,"a story of honor and integrity. Wish it had a dragon in the story line, but it did't. Easy Kindle download."
5,GO Hawk!,"This story is about a boy who will try anything to get his father's approval. He, at first, was going to take the path of darkness and throw everything else away. But when the darkness seeks to claim his younger brother as well he can't take the path of darkness any longer. He leaves his home and seeks to join King Arthur's army. But the king's trust will not be free. Can he achieve Arthur's trust and accomplish his duty.Editor of the Hoppin Readin Review"
3,Does not align with legend,"I must start off by saying that this book captivated my interest and even had me up till 2:30 one morning because I simply couldn't put it down. It is vey well written and a good tale. That said, I did not like it, for the reason that many of the characters (most offensively Arthur and Gwalchmai) do not fit into the rudiments of personalities created for them by the traditional Arthurian legend. Also, rarely do events align; however this is because it deals with the means through which Gwalchmai comes to Arthur, which is a tale left noticably untouched in traditional legend. Despite this, I found this story too marvelous to have escaped even slight mention in the legend, and thus do not find it a believable account of Gwalchmai's past. Also, I missed Gareth."
1,Disappointing at best,"I have a tendency to read anything that is even remotely connected to Arthurian legends, so I snapped up this book immediately hoping for a new angle on the familiar legend since the cover clearly indicates this is Sir Gawain's story. I cannot begin to describe the depths of my disappointment. The story is tedious at best and becomes quickly bogged down in its own distinctions of right and wrong and sorcery and Light and Darkness to the point of seeming more like a sermon than an entertaining tale. The characters are predictable to an extent beyond them just being based on familiar legend, and truly there is little to distinguish one from another. The story goes nowhere, and the number of typographical errors (a repeated sentence at one point!) makes it irritating to read. If you're truly looking for a captivating version of the King Arthur legend, I'd suggest readingTaliesin (The Pendragon Cycle, Book 1)instead of this."
4,Go Gwalchmai!,"I really liked this book and think Gillian is a wonderful writer. I have always loved the realm of King Arthur. I thought she made a truly sinister character of Gwalchmai's mother. As for Gwachmai himself he's pretty cooltoo. The one part I was'nt fond of was when he drifted on the boat and was given his sword by Lough. I thought it sort of disturbed what was a very realistic look into Arthurian times. I thought the story was interesting enough to immediately order the second part of the trilogy which so far is also really good, though not told from Gwalchmai's viewpoint as the first book is. I like the idea that Gwalchmai is rejected by Arthur and other people at first because he has the look of a sorceror. I also enjoyed her books Wolfhunt and Island of Ghosts. If you like midevil settings you will like these too!"
1,Magic Belt,"The product came in poor condition, however, the return process and crediting my account back (refund) was excellent. Therefore, I still have supreme confidence in shopping with Amazon."
2,Mostly talk...where is David playing the dulcimer?,"David Schnaufer was undoubtably the most diversely talented dulcimer player of our time. I took classes from him and have every album he produced or contributed to. I was excited when I thought I might see him play once again! This DVD is 75% talk and 25% music. There is not a single song that is completely played without the interruption of boring narrative. Its a short 28 minutes, and could serve as a basic introduction to the dulcimer and a quasi-eulogy to David.It would have been worth it if David would have been featured playing even one song, or playing alongside of the quartet...I hope the quartet will produce a music album or video to redeem this talking video. Underneath the narratives, the music showed amazing potential. And yes it was great to see David once again...If you are looking for amazing music, buy one of his albums...you won't be disappointed."
5,Great Experimentalist Soft Rock,"Gary Wright's THE DREAM WEAVER is a great CD of experimental soft rock that, unlike many of its more commercial counterparts, still holds up after over 30 years. Perhaps that's because Wright never takes his use of electronics for granted, topping them with intense, soulful lead vocals which sound like they're coming from a singer such as Solomon Burke, Don Covay, David Ruffin, or Dennis Edwards. Also, many of the rhythms come straight from late-60s/early 70s R&B rather than the disco that was becoming popular in 1975. Overall, this album has stood the test of time very well, and is a must-own for anyone who enjoys high-quality pop-rock."
5,the best cd i heaed,this is the best cd i heard in a long time .i really like his song dream weaver.
5,GREAT cd,"This is a GREAT CD, I have it and it's good!!! Brings back the memories ;)I got this cd back some years ago, but I still listen to it, I love bringing back the classics."
4,SYNTH-DRIVEN ROCK AND POP,"This album of synth-driven rock presented quite an innovative mix of textures when it was released in 1975. Love Is Alive and Let It Out have beautiful melodies and female backing vocals framing Wright's rock vocals, giving the latter a soulful feel. Feel For Me is a similar mix of pop and R&B. Can't Find The Judge has a funky rhythm and strangled vocal whilst Made To Love You is a gentle pop ballad. The pace picks up for Power Of Love with its strong rock riff and soaring vocals. Dream Weaver itself is a masterpiece of synthesizer tinkles and whooshes with evocative imagery and poetic lyrics. Although this album makes extensive use of the synthesizer, the arrangements are still in a rock/pop format and the overall sound is nothing like Kraftwerk or the later synth-pioneers like Eurythmics, OMD or Gary Numan. But it remains a minor classic with its memorable and melodic songs."
4,Decent CD,Only bought it for the two songs that were hits when I was a pre-teen.I enjoy listening to those tunes.I would recommend this CD.
3,"It's OK, but nothing measures up to the title song.","My one-line summary pretty much says it all. His classic hit ""Dream Weaver"" is by far the best thing on this album. Other than that, not much is memorable."
1,I feel that Gary should've stayed with Spooky Tooth,"I just don't think he has what it takes to be a solo artist. He's lost his rock and roll edge that he had with Spooky Tooth. I remember those classics ""Evil Woman"" 9 and half minutes of rocking, and ""Lost In My Dreams"" more intense than any Black Sabbath, or Marilyn Manson song, and they did a good rendition of the Beatles ""I Am The Walrus"". This is bland pop music. I used to wake up to ""Dream Weaver"" along with Aerosmith's ""Dream On"", and one other tune every morning on Philly's WFIL AM 560. I didn't like ""Dream Weaver"" then I don't like it now. I especially hate ""Love Is Alive"" as it makes me cry as it's just a sad song. I had another solo album from Gary called ""Touch and Gone"" it's just as bad if not worse than ""Dream Weaver"". For some odd reason Gary lost his rock and roll when he left Spooky Tooth, and I don't know if he'll ever find it again. Hopefully so."
1,ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD,"People cite the title track ""DREAM WEAVER"" as the finest offering on this CD. As a matter of actual fact, it is possibly the worst thing to ever happen since Hitler invaded Poland. Rock can be divided into two distinct eras: Pre Dream Weaver (PD), and After Dream Weaver (AD). Dream Weaver itself is Ground Zero. PD Rock is fierce and driven, motivated and weeping, screaming for us to examine ourselves. Ground Zero was like an Atomic Bomb bent on destroying all things that bound us together. It's many little bells and inlay of glitter tapestry was sickening. Once I was exposed to it I craved nothing but silence, blessed silence. What followed (AD), was an era dominated by Disco, and deafening Dream Weaver knock-offs. It would be a full twenty years before the Rock Revival of the mid 90's. A damn nightmare."
1,Horrible scale,give me a 10 lb range inside of 5 min...you can step on it 6 times in a row and get 6 different weights with a 10lb weight range.. not worth it get something else!
1,Don't buy this scale,"This is the worst scale I have ever used. Just like what most of the other reviewers have mentioned, the weight fluctuates even when you measure the weight successively within a minute. The fluctuation on my scale is within 4 lbs. It is very frustrating to use such an inaccurate scale, because it is as good as not using one. I will never trust the Healthometer brand ever.And for the reviewer who thinks that other reviewers couldn't ""follow instructions"" and stand still while they weigh themselves, please don't insult other people's intelligence."
1,Missing blade,"As the other reviewer states, this knife has only the gut hook. I was looking for a Wyoming knife with both blades. The picture shows two blades. What more can I say."
4,Simple and effective,"Purchased this to connect my iPhone 4S and Studio Neat GLIF & Serif to my dSLR. The item works as advertised.. a shoe mount to tripod thread. If you're looking for a simple, effective way to do the same look no further!"
1,JUNK,Items Was bent bulk packaging way to long than discribed just not what i was looking for maby thay should check items befor thay ship...
5,special is right,"love, love, love this tea. it brews up with a beautiful color and aroma. although it's wonderful by itself, i sometimes add a little ground cardamom, ground ginger and honey for a slight chai flavor."
3,Did not fit my GMT-12A,I received these in hopes to make them work with my older meter. A previous review indicated they had to plug the longer probe into the meter and then solder alligator clips to the other end. This will work if you don't mind this solution and you have an older meter.The picture in the listing showed leads with a plug that goes into the meter as straight (in-line) leads without a protective cover. What I received was labeled as stated but the plug end that goes into the meter had a right angle and had a protective cover over the metal pin. I did cut the protective cover away and tried to fit it and the pin was the correct diameter to fit the meter but was not long enough to plug into the meter.I contacted Gardner Bender who told me they stopped making the correct test leads for my older meter in 2006 (because the meter design changed) and they no longer have stock on the previous connectors.For the cost of a new meter I will probably just upgrade...
3,Oh well....,"The description says these leads will fit the GMT-12A meter. Unfortunately, they don't fit my GMT-12A meter. I have to admit I bought my meter many years ago so perhaps the design has changed.It's not worth sending them back but I discovered that the probe ends plug into the meter and fit perfectly, so I'll just cut off the useless plugs, solder on some alligator clips (or whatever I have laying around) and voila! Test leads.I can't say the parts are bad as they obviously fit somebody's meter. Also the communication and delivery service from Grady's was pretty good.But now I can show-off my shade-tree test leads to some purist friends who will absolutely cringe at the fact that I would butcher up test leads instead of getting the exact replacement. I'll even stick some duct tape on them to ugly them up even more and cause further consternation! HAHA, these are well worth the price!"
4,"excellent text, 5 stars if it wasn't for the typos","This is a great reference, with wonderful physical insight into plasma kinetics mechanisms. Unfortunately the astonishing work of the authors is undermined by minor typos from the editor, which may throw off beginners- equations where charges or species don't add up, and the like. I could not find an errata yet, therefore only the 4 stars; but sincere congrats to the authors for such indepth and insightful work."
3,Acne Hello,Not sure if it works for hair growth but it does multiply the pimples on my face. Once I stop using it they went away and now it's just the normal pms pimples. Too much biotin is not a good thing for me.
2,Just vitamins,I really have not seem any change. But if the ingredients are correct. They are still good vitamins to take.
3,im still waiting for results?!,I`ve been taking these pills for about a month and only notice healthier looking hair and no growth. i am giving it another month to see if there are any results.
4,"So far, So good!","I have only been using this product for two weeks and it really does seem to be working! For years I have struggled with breakage and have been at my wits end with my short hair, relying on extensions to keep the length I like. Though I have never tried a product like this, I was very skeptical, but knew I had to try it after reading all the reviews. I am proud to say that I've already seen a change! My hair is much softer, shiner and even a little thicker. Before I started, I was due for a relaxer, but now I will be able to hold out for quite a while. I have also noticed a little difference in length and can't wait for more results!"
2,could be more potent,"I used this product for the 45 days and did not see any enhancment of hair growth.this bottle only has 99mg of MSM and 300mcgs of biotin. ( the vitamin used to promote hair and nail growth) this is 100% of your daily need.( and that is only if you take the three a day as directed) There fore, it will not enhance your hair growth if you already have had decent diet of biotin and other B vitamins. Hairfinity, however, has 2500 mcgs of biotin and and 750 mgs of MSM. This will promote enhancement. Ther has been no findings of any bad side effects of taking more than 100% of your daily need of biotin.IF you have a great diet already, i do not recommend this product. If you don't have a god diet, you should try eating better because it would be cheaper than buying these vitamins."
3,First Impressions,so far i have only been using this product a few days and im still working on keeping up with taking it three times daily. on the positive side it arrived within three days which i wasnt expecting since i qualified for free shipping. on the negative side as soon as i opened the bottle i hated the smell i almost didnt give them a chance because it made me sick but i decided to try and will update on my growth soon.
2,Not a miracle,"My hair suffered a bad break off, and I used these vitamins for about a 1 1/2 months, and it did NOTHING for the length, maybe the texture changed, but if you are looking to go from Halle Berry to Rapunzel over the months, this isnt the product for you."
3,UNSURE ABOUT IF IT WORKS OR NOT.,"I can't say anything bad or good about this product because, I don't know if it worked. I used it for a few months, but didn't see any improvements in my hair growth. I was also using other hair growth prodcuts as well so...I just don't know. To each it's own."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this product. Your money would be better spent on regular hair vits which would not only be cheaper, but if you compare the ingredients, you'll find that fast grow contains nothing more than any other hair vitamin on the shelf. if you're into more natural vits, taking plain old vit e (1 x wk), a horsetail & a biotin will do the same for you if not more"
2,EHH,"I had to return this product because it is basically a placebo. You have to take it too many times and the results arent anything less than what you would normally get> I gave 2 stars because maybe I did not use it long enough to see the ""miracle"". I stopped using it in February and have since just focused on nuturing my hair, scalp massages and no heat and I have already grown 2.5 inches. Don't waste your money."
4,Well...,"Since using this product I CAN and WILL say that my hair has grew a bit... but the problem is, while it was growing it was hard managing my relaxers and new growth! I would get new growth immediately (especially when using these pills) and my hair would break because of the kinky roots and straight strands. So I don't know... I don't want to complain because my hair has grown 'a bit' but my hair has been breaking also. Also I can't estimate how fast or how different my hair grew since my hair grows fast anyway. But overall, I only 'liked' the product and will switch to a different hair supplement pill-- only because I like to try new products, not because of the product itself. :)"
2,Waiting for results,"The jury is still out...This is my second bottle of Ethnic Grow hair supplements, and I have not seen enough credible growth to post an honest review. I want to give myself a minimum of 60 days to observe real 'changes'(if any )in growth. I will up date my comments when I have completed the final bottle."
5,Lovin' It Already!,"So I've been using this for only 3 days, and I feel likeI see results already. Maybe I just feel that cause I'm excitedto see if it works, but I really feel like my hair has already startedgrowing faster! Can't wait to see the results after using it for a fullmonth :) I'm also taking a daily vitamin (and drinkin lots of water), sothat could be part of why I feel like I'm seeing results so quick. But I havefaith in this product. Seems like it's going to do what it says it does. The onlydownside is the smell, YUCK. But other than that, I really really like it :)So now it's been 10 days, and i already see the speed of my hair growth picking up.My hair is a little longer than it was before i started. Can't wait to see howmuch it's grown at the end of the month! :)"
3,Not sure if it's working ...,"Fast Grow ethnic hair growth enhancerwell I've been taking it as religiously as possible only for about a month or so and i don't think that a good basis for review since most products require about 90days to take effect. i will not try it again, i don't think because it just doesn't seem legitimate enough and the dosage listed don't seem high enough. it's one more pill i have to swallow anyway..hehe... i can do without. I may try something different and something i can easily pick up at local health store. thanks"
5,Shiny healthy hair..,"Okay, I know I may sound silly, but this product really makes my hair shiny and healthy. Once my hair grows to a certain length, it usually starts to break. I have not had any breakage since using this product (almost 6 months now). Also, my stylist said she's notice a big difference in my hair. I really love this product. I just wish I could remember to take it as I should. Even when missing days, my hair still remains healthy. I am usually a skeptic, but this has worked for me. Remember, all things aren't for everyone, so if you try it and it doesn't work for you, don't knock the product... maybe it's just not for you!!!"
4,Can caucasian women use it?,I just wanted to know if Caucasian women can use this product as well? Has anyone tried it?I really want to try out something that will help me with growing out damaged hair and starting over!
3,Ethic hair growth,After recieving the product quickly I was very excited but experience no dramatic hair growth. I wouldnt recommend this product for growth but I will recommend it for shedding and strength
2,Great for nail growth,"During my pregnancy, my hair was falling out in patches, so I purchased these pills since nothing was helping it to grow back. After finishing 1 bottle, I did not notice any hair growth. However, my nails did grow noticibly faster and longer."
2,No Results,"I purchased the 30 day supply (90 capsules).One of the ingredients in is Biotin (300mcg/0.3mg) which is known to promote skin, hair and nail improvements and growth. Another ingredient is He Shou Wu (99mg) an Asian herb that promotes not only hair improvements but physical improves to one's body.I was very optimistic about this product. I have been sampling a number of hair growth products. Fast Grow compared to the others showed disappointedly no results for me. Prior to beginning this new product I trim my hair.Instructions are to take 3 capsules daily ideally with a meal or snack. There were no side effects that I noticed. At the end of the month the growth that occurred was the normal growth, there was no accelerated growth while using this product. Hope this was helpful."
5,So far it works,I always had very think long hair to be a African American. I started getting perms and Dying my hair and the Beta Blockers Medication I used had took almost all of my hair out. I was frantic. I used all type of hair growing products spend over 300 dollars on Hair growing shampoos conditioners and vitamins and oils and havent seen any hair growth or results. I just started using Fast Growth Vitamins and my hair is getting thick and is growing longer now. I am truly shocked and very impressed. I will definitely buy more
3,It works but a word of caution......,"I took this product for three and a half months. I did not see a dramatic change in the length of my hair, but it made my new growth really really soft.However I had to stop taking the product because I began having an allergic reaction to it. I would take a pill in the night before bed and wake up with swollen eye lids the next morning. This started to happen in the fourth month of use.Overall I would say it works in the short run but I would not recommend this product for long term use"
1,Don't Buy Save Your Money... and Your Hair!,"I bought this product after reading all the reviews it recieved. I took the pills and saw the growth BUT there were concequences. If you are the type to take pills forever for your hair growth, then this product is for you. But I'm not. When I stopped taking these pills, my hair started to fall out. Looking back on it my hair was shedding and breaking from the roots for about 8 months total (less and less each month). I stared using DAX and Optimum Oil Therapy Dry Hair Healer. I put the two in a container that I can use directly on my scalp and it's been great every since. Find out what your hair type you have and educate yourself on products or natural ingredients that really work for your own scalp.1 Corinthians 11:15But long hair is something for the woman to be proud of. Her hair has been given to her for a covering.God Bless"
2,No Change,"I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I have not noticed anything new. Still have slight breakage and no noticable growth. And yes, I am active, drinkin lots of wated and watching my diet ( since that seems to be advice that most get when the poduct isnt working) I will finish my bottle and just see if I notice anything by then. Not sayin its a good or bad product. Right now, I guess I'm still waiting for some results."
1,2 Months--No Results So Far!,"I used to take a hair/nail & skin vitamin i bought from the cheap-o discount store down the street--cost $1.99 & was a no-name brand. i kid thee not my hair was thicker & fuller within wks. i swore by those things until the store suddenly stopped selling them--i have no idea what the name was or where else to get them. been looking for a replacement ever since. came across Fast Growth, been taking them for almost 3 months now and have seen no results whatsoever in hair growth at all--wont be ordering again. Sometimes the cheap no-name stuff is just better."
1,placebo vitamins,"I purchased four(4) bottles of this product to get an accurate assessment of its effectiveness. I might have well used 1-A-Day instead( Vitamins A+E aid in hair growth.) Following instructions, four months have produced no noticable effect. Perhaps its ingredients have varying effects between body chemistry types."
2,not too great,"I wish I had've kept the receipt because they do reimburse. If you do some research on the ingredients some of them will cause drastic side effects. Also, it is a pain to try to swallow them three times a day. I havn't been able to see any true progress and I had them for a week, although I havn't actually took three a day. All in all due to the side effects, I say no!"
4,Taaarrrrific,"(from fiance) The skirt was a little ripped when we got it, but other than that it is cute and fits, though the size runs a little bit small, which was fortunate in my case."
4,OK,"I had to do some alterations on this. It was a little too big (I'm an 8/10). Once I did, it looked ok."
4,"Party, party, party",I wore this to a pirate party. It was unlike many of the other costumes and at a great price.
5,Excellent Must Read Book!!!!!!!!!!,"This was an enlightening book for me and would be for anybody interested in spirituality, and pilgrimage. Filled with full colour pictures it is a MUST READ book!!!!! Very very hhighly recommended!"
1,It's STILL A lousy movie,"I saw this flick and I have to agree with Blue Jean over our friend from Britain here. It may be an amateur film, but it's still boring, badly explained, dull to look at, and a general waste of time. Americans like foreign films; we just don't like dull foreign films. I'd rather sit through ""My Dinner With Andre"" (which is a good movie) a hundred times than see this one again. The students who made this need to go back to school until they learn how to make a movie that has engaging characters, clear explanation, an interesting storyline, and better lighting. And oh, leave the torn pocket alone, kids; nobody cares about that."
3,It was alright,I enjoyed the book... For the most part. I don't think the title really fits it. The ending is sad :( But I would read another from Erick Gray.
4,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS,THIS WAS A GOOD READ I JUST DONT KNOW WHY ITS CALLED NASTY GIRLS TOO THEY WERENT NASTY THE ONLY THING THAT WAS NASTY ABOUT IT WAS SHY I AINT GONNA SAY WHAT BUT SHE MESSED UP AND DID THE ULTIMATE NO NO BUT OVERALL VERY GOOD BOOK
4,IT WAS HOTT,I REALLY DID LIKE THE BOOK I'M A FAN OF ERICK GRAY PUT I WISH WE HAD MORE OF A UNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENED TO SHY DID SHE GET HELP DID CAMILE LEAVE HER BEHIND AND WHAT ABOUT ROSCOE HOW MANY YEARS DID HE DO BUT ALL IN ALL THE BOOK WAS GOOD LET ME PUT YOU DOWN WITH GETTO HEAVEN GET THAT BOOK IT WAS 5 STARS TO ME! BY ERICK GRAY!
4,Friendships last forever no matter what,This book made you think not to ever think it can happen to you. These girls had a great friendship and the bond that they created with each other was on breakable no matter what. I hope this book comes out with a sequel bec there were so many unanswered questions and I leave you with this never let a man misguide your own judgement and lead you to a life of hurt and dispair.
4,"Filters, The must have Book.",I have read several books on the subject and found this one to be very helpful.
5,Best practical book on filters.,"This is probably the best book on filters ever written. Frost is clear and practical in his explanations and recommendations of brand and uses of the various types of filters. This book helped me decide on my brand of filters and their best uses.I would recommend this book for anyone who has no clue which filter or brand to invest in. Even a pro would learn a thing or two in here. You would find great tips on how to make adjustments to filters, and their best uses. It's a great reference book for anyone."
5,Lee Frost's writings are in an understandable format,"I own other books by Frost, and I've always enjoyed his writing style. His writings are easily understood so the average person can apply his methods and see improved results. Frost show before and after results of filter use, giving full details on the filters and camera settings used."
3,pond fish net,"The net is good, but thought it was suppose to be telescopic...it's alittle short for a pon...but good quality and size."
4,sort of disappointed after reading the reviews,The story was great but Joanna wasn't burned as bad as you'd think. I thought she'd be horrific looking and Gavin would love her anyways. Only minor burns.....no wonder he didn't have a problem loving her. Still worth the reading time. Enjoy.
5,A great book!,It's a fun book to read to preschoolers. Its a cute book to read with your young/early reader. Its a GREAT book when your 5 year old reads it to you.
2,so-so,"My four year old son is not interested in this book at all. The images make it a bit confusing: there's a picture of a word, then the word with a letter that is supposed to be in a state of change, then a picture of the new word that was formed. I think the second picture is what's confusing him. There's also no real plot that I can see, which is probably why he doesn't like it. This seems like a perfectly fine book with cute pictures, it's just not for us."
4,Impressive follow up....,"to the perfect ""Captain and Me"" album. The Doobies were on a roll during this period, cranking out great tunes with regularity. While this one isn't quite as strong as ""Captain..."" it is still a very close second for me. The song everyone remembers from this album is of course the overplayed(but a great song nonetheless) ""Black Water"". My favorites here are ""Another Park, Another Sunday"", ""Eyes of Silver"" and the opening track ""Song To See You Through"". The Doobies were undergoing a transition around this time,about to add personnel in the person of the great Jeff ""Skunk"" Baxter of Steely Dan fame (he is in evidence on this album). This album is a must have for Doobies fans.Four and a half stars."
4,PRIME TIME RYHMES,"Captures the spirit of the times very well. Does sound and look somewhat prefabricated, but who cares really? I know I don't. Load it in your CD deck, Get a case of beer, light a joint, turn it up, and cruise the back roads. This is how one travels in time. Thank you DR. Doobie!"
4,good stuff,"i know they are not popular songs, but ""song to see you through"" and ""tell me what you want (i'll give you what you need)"" have got to be some of the best songs i have ever heard. they got me through some hard times. word."
4,Those guys from East really now how to get it down!,"kinky kinky kinky...between the trains, the sex chats scenes, and the actual sex scenes, this film really gets u going. A nice film of Train and Off Train motivation."
4,Not bad,For soft core stuff it's pretty good. This girl is very attractive. I can't really say I have any complaints.
3,Nice Sexy movie - Eye candy,This is a Japanese version of Eye Candy and it's good for the girls it shows. Nothing major in XXX department.
5,Absolutely Amazing- Works Instantly- A Miracle,"I run a pet sanctuary and pet consulting business. I have recommended this product to everyone with pets. It's completely safe so I don't have to rinse it which saves time. It works instantly instead of taking days/weeks like the more ""popular"" brands of odor products. Inappropriate urination is the #1 reason pet cats are turned into shelters. This is a small company with an excellent product- do not pass it up because you haven't heard of it. I do my best to get the word out for them because I think it'll save the lives of many pets. I also use it on dogs that have rolled in dead animals, or have doggy odor. I use it on everything, even hiking shoes, not just pet-related odors! I've researched it well and have used it for years. I'm convinced that it is safe to use directly on pets and people. Most people are stunned with the fact that it actually works instantly. It seems to good to be true, but it's true. I promise. Zenk9.com"
5,Great for diaper pails,"This is the only thing I have found that will remove the built-up stench from a two-year-old Diaper Champ diaper pail, and I tried a LOT of things. The spray gets rid of the smell, but has no odor of its own once it dries. It's also nontoxic, which is a big plus for owners of small children and other pets. Fortunately I haven't had to use it on other surfaces... yet."
5,Love this,"I received this for my daughter when she was a newborn. Now she is 15 months old and this is what we call""baby"". She won't sleep without her and hasn't for many months. My daughter is a thumb sucker and she holds on to it while sucking her thumb. ""Baby"" has helped us get through shots and boo-boos. The only advice i have is buy more than one just to have one for back up or while washing the other one.We now have three - one for home, one for daycare and one for back up. Oh and to wash it I throw it in the washing machine on gentle and I even throw it in the dryer. It holds up wonderfully and is still very soft. I don't know what we'd do without this item."
4,Great Wide Angles for Amateurs,"I'm very satisfied with the lenses, the resolution is crisp and pics look great. Raynox puts out incredible products indeed.The complaint; extremely high barrel distortion, and yes very noticeable even in the viewfinder of my S2is. Can be completely corrected though with the use of Panorama Tools. So how cheap it is, come with a little bit more extra work. Also with lenses this big (especially on an S2is or an S3is), the flash gets a restrike which shows on the photo having an oval dark tint on the bottom when the flash is used at full wide angle **which is mentioned in the Raynox website by the way.A few minor complaints, but it surpasses my expectations of a good lens, these are not cheap knock-offs of questionable glass, these are great lenses."
5,all-time classic,"In response to the previous reviewers question the answer is ""yes."" Although some of these songs had previously been recorded at studio 1, all of the songs on this album were recorded and mixed by Mr. Perry at his legendary Black Ark studio during the studio's artistic high-water mark.The creativity of Lee Perry's production on this album and other albums in this time period is unparalleled. Not just in reggae, but in ANY musical genre. Whether you're a fan of roots reggae or a casual Bob Marley fan looking to branch out (Lee Perry was instrumental in Marley's success), or a fan of top-flight production in general. This album, the ones the previous reviewer mentioned, Perry's Arkology box-set, and Junior Murvin's ""Police and Thieves"" are wonderful. The output of a true genius at the height of his artistic power and command."
2,I am very disappointed,"Yes, I am still very, very disappointed. Why? This item was intended as a gift for a very respectful and dear friend of mine. And I was waiting it with the real gladness. And what?!!! Opening the box I found that the very important part of it, the converter, isn't there... Unfortunately, I have opened it being already far fom the US, and I couldn't return it or at least make a complaint about such a loathsome attitude towars the consumer..."
5,Works exactly as it should.,These are an exact fit for an insulated lunch box I use. They stay cold all day when in a properly insulated container. I have not had any of these break or leak (that would be a deal-killer for me!) Works as advertised.
1,Bad Film production = Poor quality film,"10 years and still not paid?This movie was a joke. I worked on the film, but had no idea how bad it was.Most of the reviews look like they where written by the producing team and Paul Corvino.I was ripped off and never got paid by the scum writer Paul Corvino who personally stole negatives why looking at the photo selects. I did not relies until the next day that they where gone. He stole them to produce the box and send out PR pix. The production company aka Larry Eudene / director and his wife also tried to make me eat my own expenses. I had to sue to cover the film cost from Paul Corvino, Paul Corvino settled and agreed to pay me usage fees when the images where used. I never got paid from this thief."
1,Reunion Review,This was one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. The plot was unrealistic. It was grainy and unprofessional.And it's message was warped. The only redeeming quality was the acting of the male and female lead. Timothy Devlin was terrific and Mimi Langeland was just as strong.
5,"Funkify Yo' Life, yo'!","No D. Garibaldi, no problem. This album is truly underrated and the last with Lenny Williams. If you haven't heard this album yet, do yourself a favor and do so before you die. You won't regret it."
4,excellent r & b album from 1974.,"this is a fun, horn-driven set of rhythm and blues. white boys (all but one,anyway) who at times sound somewhere in the stevie wonder neighborhood of things, at other times in the jazzier realm of r & b. very energetic, very at ease with this music, these are some outstanding musicians delivering a fine creation to the world. i wish i had talent."
4,Urban Renewal,"This is classic TOP, reportedly Mic Gillette's favorite recording with the group. There are great, funky grooves and tight TOP horns and many memorable tunes. I rank this one just a half-notch below the Tower of Power release."
1,Disappointed,"This is an interesting book to read but I was looking for an actual cookbook, with recipes, in a cookbook format, which this book is not. If you read enough chapters you can glean various steps to the sourdough process but there are no recipes in an easy-to-follow format. I would have preferred to have the story telling in one section and a recipe section at the end."
5,It's a delight! I giggled with happiness!,"I tend not to read Regency romances so much as other things, but I was recommended to this book by a friend. I have read and enjoyed Jane Austen, who is of course writing during the period during which her stories take place, so she doesn't have a sense of humor about the delicious histronics that go on in a young girl when she's in love and can't admit it. Madeline Delaney is someone who, despite her curricles and duenna, I can really relate to - she's a big spaz and full of energy and very real to me. Devin Forth is so stern, he's the perfect man-you-have-always-wanted but was just not available - I was really tickled by her sense of drama and hyperbole. I hope Miss Blair comes out with another book soon - I like her style!"
4,Wal-Mart Exclusive Disc,"This particular release of the 1933 film was actually a ""bonus disc"" that was offered in a two-pack at Wal-Mart stores when the 2005 remake, a Paris Hilton starring travesty, was released on disc (hence the ""Promtional Disc. Not For Sale Or Redistribution"" tag at the bottom of the cover artwork). I'm assuming that it's a direct port from the 1953 ""House of Wax"" disc, and I guess the really cool things about it is that it's the only way to get this classic 1933 film as a stand-alone disc, and that it's a release that has never been offered as a stand-alone retail item."
3,GREAT FILM. But don't buy it here.,"This is a great film and i dont protest anyone wanting to buy this. BUT DON'T. I don't know about this DVD but new it is about $40. Altough you can get this and the originall Vincent Price classic House Of Wax for $8.99. Ok, i know your thinking its a different movie. But the H.O.W. DVD has both House of Wax and Mystery of the Wax Museum for just $9 from Amazon.See my point?"
3,Interesting and well done.,"The video is based on a survivor account but seems more a tale of luck and narrow scrapes than of what I'd suspect was needed in the dull, slow, grinding task of hiding. In other words, while interesting the presentation didn't seem realistic enough. It's still worth seeing and watching however, and seems quite realistic enough in terms of the settings used."
5,touching story during WW2,"I finally found and purchased this wonderful little film about Alex who waits for his father, all alone, in the ghetto. His determination and vulnerability are well played by the young actor who is alone in front of the camera very often during the movie. I knew that film from an old VHS borrowed many years ago but it was with a French title and even if I would type the word ""Island"" at Amazon.com, it did not appear but finally I found it on Google and back again at Amazon.com which found it from a little shop elsewhere. And the magic worked again when I watched it ! Touching and inspiring story which is a true story by the way. If you like WW2 films and kids, you will love this film!"
3,"good but won't play in a US DVD player, only in computer","The content of this DVD is very good. It is especially good if you want some ideas to decorate a new place but don't have patience to read long books about lofts and urban houses. You will see the best interior designers in the world in action and will marvel at how wowing and trendy their creations are. Unfortunatelly, although the Australian DVD makers claim that this is some kind of universal DVD that it is not zone 1 but will play in any country of the world, this DVD won't play in the US. I could only see the images in my computer. It's a pitty because I investigated their web site and they have fantastic DVD titles. It's as if GQ magazine british edition had a d DVD version. They have videos about the best in the world in terms of fashion, watches, wines, food, etc. You can investigate it at http://www.thestylist.tv but again be prepared to watch this in your computer only."
1,I was sent a damaged used DVD,"Had read earlier review and was prepared for it not to play on a DVD player but it would not even open on a p.c. or mac computer, it's very unfortunate as I had hoped to show it to a design class. printing was smeared and disk had scratches as well."
5,Best Puppy Pen Ever Made!!!,"This Precision Puppy Pen is great.I raise small puppies and I own 10 of these in different sizes.They open from the top and have a front door.The top opening feature is great for puppies,so they cant come piling out.When they potty it goes straight down to the bottom away from them through the floor grate.They are big enough for them to have a big bed,food and water and a potty area.Also fold completely flat for storage.Easy to clean and maintain.I would reccomend these to anyone with puppies.They also make a great and spacious pen for small adult dogs.Not small and confined like a crate.I give this product an A+++++ Rating."
3,precision puppy pen,I can say you get what you pay for I can't complain about the price. The pens are not are durable as I would like. The packaging was damaged when I got it and the pans were bent.
4,A Must for Breeders,"This is a must for Dog breeders; safe confinement, adjustable hieght levels eliminate bending over and made well. This can also be used for a mobile potty; contains your pet and keeps it safe no matter where you go. Perfect for the show dog on the go. I highly recommend the product."
5,great purse,I bought this for my best friend who is a NY fan and her favorite color is pink so it was perfect. She was SOOOOO excited about this purse! She couldnt stop showing it off to her friends!
4,Looks Great,Looks great and is easy to install. After only one day I've already gotten a bunch of complements. I was pleasantly surprised that the directions included a cutting template for the lower air dam.I would have given it five stars but it arrived with a good size chip in the paint that I'll have to touch up. Also it said to apply anti-seize compound to the stainless steel bolt threads but didn't include any.
1,"Not worth the time, not worth the money","I bought this book based on the 4.5 stars that the original reviews had given it. It must have the author's friends. None of the examples work and could never work no matter what platform. It is obvious that the author never actually worked through these issues although it looks good enough that it faked me out. Examples: he uses virtual base classes as if they were implementation classes (DOMImplementation class), he uses methods that dont exist (System.out.null()), he fails to declare or instantiate items that he uses in the examples, ..., ..., ... It took me a month to work my own way through the 2nd chapter. Not worth the time, not worth the money."
3,Out of Date?,"This book is full of good information about XML and Java, and almost any developer using XML for the first time would find it useful. However, I think it is a little out of date. A lot of the ""extension"" packages it talks about have actually been encorportated into the Java platform in one way or another, and there are a few new XML-Java initiatives that it does not cover. Also, some of the examples in the book are a bit contrived, and not very practical for real world applications. But on the whole, I think this is a very good introduction to the subject."
3,"Sloppy editing, otherwise not really bad","I bought this book for its sections on XML-RPC, SOAP and such. It had no in-depth coverage of these topics, but the overview wasn't too bad. However, the editing is bad, so you have contradictory sentences, even on the same page. Also the examples have lots of problems. If you want to use this book to get some overview, it's ok, but don't rely on it as the final word."
2,Does not handle SVIDEO inputs well.,"I bought this tv so that I could upgrade to HD, but I also needed to play my recorded shows from my Replay TV which has a SVIDEDO and composite output. After purchasing the tv and hooking it up to my Replay via the SVIDEO input, the picture quality was poor with far to much pixelation. Tried all the different screen modes to no avail. Returned the tv the same day as I am not ready to retire my replay units. This tv may be fine for HD (which is the picture they have on display in the store), but if you are going to hook up older video equipment to it that outputs SVIDEO or composite video, you will be disapointed with the picture. The pixelation on these inputs becomes annoying whether you are 3 ft away or 6. I had much higher hopes for this tv."
3,a lemon,"I think we got a lemon. We really enjoyed this TV, but after less than 2 years of use the LCD screen died. The repair price is $500-600."
4,Boss loves it,"You can change to wide screen view based on input. It hides inputs you aren't using so switching source doesn't take as long. Overall good set. Nice remote, just didn't work with my old DISH satelitte box."
4,Not Your Average Desperate Cop,"i found this book on my bookshelf and read the back with prejudge disinterest. half the books i own, and there's a lot, were given to me by someone who was moving and didnt want the extra baggage. THE TIN COLLECTORS was one among many other cop novels, mysteries, and historical war novels.from page one i was hooked.Although it doesnt read in first person, i got a sense of a well-developed character almost as though i knew the guy. the quick-paced plot, love-to-hate/hate-to-love characters, the twist and turns, and my favorite: the internal cop-corruption made me glad this was just the beginning of a SHANE SCULLY series.THE VIKING FUNERAL sits half-read on my desk now."
5,FAST PACED THRILLER,"Mr. Cannell has captured the essence of suspense, drama and excitement in this fictional ""real life"" story. From start to finish, the plot thickens with tension at every turn. I couldn't put this book down until I finished!!!!"
5,Great writing.,I'm reading all the Shane Scully novels at present.Theres something about Cannell as an author that makes reading his novels great!!!!
5,TIN COLLECTORS,"Another great read from Stephen Cannell. Shane always wins in the end, but he has to get beat up to get there."
4,Mindless fun,"Shane Scully received an emergency call from his ex-partner's wife saying that her husband is trying to kill her. Shane comes and shoots his former partner, Molars, dead in a clear case of self-defense. Unfortunately, Molars buddies do not see it that way and they will go beyond the call of duty to make Scully's life a living hell.This is one of those books that if the bad guys had left well enough alone there would not be a novel. In this case, there is an extensive Internal Affairs investigation to bring Scully down. Shane's hand is forced and he investigates his former partner. He uncovers a conspiracy in the LAPD as well as the mayor's office.If you do not try to look for logic in the story you might enjoy it. This book is pure escapist fiction where anything can happen. Lot of action, lot of chases and lot of double crossing. I liked this book, but I preferred KING CON."
5,Fantastic Audio and Video Really Bring this Disc to Life,"This DVD has it all...the songs we all know and love - packaged in a truly fabulous audio and video presentation! The DTS 5.1 format really brings this performance to life, making this one of my favourites to ""show off"" the home theatre. A must have for any audio enthusiast!Even if you aren't in it for the audio/video quality, the song selection is superb, covering all of the old favourites! Paul Simon and his band really capture the essence of the music in this amazing performance! Definitely a DVD that you will pull off the shelf monthly - it won't be collecting dust!"
3,Videophiles steer clear!,"Something bad happened with the video transfer. Color and contrast looks OK, but there are some issues with the resolution being reduced from some high-resolution format (or perhaps from French SECAM format?) to NTSC res. On a big screen or projected the information is simply lost giving the effect of thin lines and sharp edges 'disappearing' between the pixels. It is most visible right at the beginning when the camera does a slow zoom on the neon sign and all the jagged lines. Yuck!! Sorry, I'm a visual person and expect to get 'DVD' quality video when I buy a DVD, so this really annoyed me.Other than that, I have to give three stars for the great music, decent audio (make sure to manually select something better in the menu than the default, PCM!). I keep finding myself putting in the disc eventhough I know I'll cringe if I look too closely at the video transfer."
1,DON'T,"If you're not sure, DON'T. What's up with the hands? Audience looks dead. Band looks dead. Is he on a budget?! How about a couple pretty backup singers to liven things up on ""50 ways"", etc. etc. Just bland. I'm a casual fan, but just no punch to this show. Like a dead fish. Get Diana Krall in Paris instead. Same venue, but oh my what a difference."
4,highly recommended,"There are many great moments in this concert and the music is always good, with Simon and an eleven-piece band cooking away. The musicians obviously love playing Simon's music and there are some special highlights such as the percussion duel that segues ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes"" into ""You Can Call Me Al"" (the latter featuring a double dose of that funky bass guitar coda); a trio of early S&G; tunes finishing with a great version of ""I Am a Rock"" and a sing-along version of ""The Boxer"". Simon also bravely tackles ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" (written specifically for Garfunkel's much more powerful vocal abilities) but sadly, there is only one song from the underrated ""Rhythm of the Saints"" (And if anyone knows if there's a DVD version of Simon performing ""The Cool, Cool River"" at The Grammys, please post that info here!!).All in all, highly recommended."
1,Save Your Money,I gave them as a x-mas present and one broke within 2 weeks. Unfortunatly they only have a 30 day exchange policy and I purchased them in early December....
5,Superb Coverage of Research Design,"While written for those preparing a dissertation or thesis, the book proves extremely useful for the undergraduate discovering the world of research. Unfamiliar terms are thoroughly explained along with a clear illustration of many potentially obscure methodologies. This book is a ""must have"" for anyone preparing for a research project."
5,If you are doing research read this,Do not start your readings about qualitative or quantitative resreach somewhere else. This book will tell you what your supervisor did notl. Its a must a must for your research. It gives you a step by step approach on how to conduct and write up your research.
4,refills for Nerf Crossbow,I looked for a while for an arrow that would work with my vintage Nerf Crossobow. This one will work.
4,Good book,"Overall, it is a good book with clear instruction for intermediate user.I give it 4 stars since it doesn't tell you the detailed procedures to reproduce the cool special effect described in the Part 4 (Real World Case Stuides)."
4,Good quality reproductions,"Nice coffee table book for sure. Inspirational for geometric abstract artists, even vector artists and illustrators. Great for color fans, obviously, as Albers was one of the color masters. Would not pay full price."
2,"Visually over-designed, functionally undersigned","Good workmanship and average materials, mediocre functionality.- Abundance of the straps and cords which cannot be tucked in create a floppy look.- Yellow, reflective accents are hardly life-saving but looking clownish and attracting undesirable attention.- Shoulder strap pad never stays where it should be- Bottle holders have no profiled bottom making the bottle easy to slip away- as many as three company aggressively designed logos installedAltogether an example of a visually over-designed, functionally undersigned, irritating piece of merchandise."
4,Good for Overall Use,"The pack has tons of storage space. I'm using it daily around an industrial site to keep my camera, tools, glasses, and notepad handy but not in hand. I only have one gripe. I don't use the over-the-neck strap and it doesn't seat well against the small of my back if I've got the pack loaded up. Other than that, it's very sturdy and has lots of extra loops that carabiners can be hooked to."
5,Mountainsmith Tour Lumbar Pack,"I have found this to be most useful on day hikes, particularly for carrying camera gear and snacks/water for the day. Comfortable, durable and easy to use."
2,"Great illustration, but adult plot","The artwork is lovely, but I have trouble imagining any kidrelating to the topic of this book -- it seems clearly aimedat the adult doing the reading, rather than at the kid. (And,even the adult needs to have a taste for the heavy-handed.)"
1,"Too many ingredients, steps---and too much final product.","I bought this disappointing book after I was impressed by the ""Serves One"" cookbook. This cookbook has no helpful pictures, and there was also quite a lack of meat-free meals. I made the turkey meatball recipe, and it took A LOT of ingredients, a lot more time than she said it would take, and it made about 4 meals worth of food. And then I still had to come up with side dishes. Furthermore, when you're eating alone, you might not want to have to make 3 separate dishes just to cull a meal out of the cookbook. I like more all-inclusive meals when I'm alone, because I'm also the one doing the dishes and spending my whole night in the kitchen. Once I decided I had no use for this cookbook, I tried to give it away, but sadly, my single friend GAVE IT BACK!"
2,Poor quality book,"The recipes are decent, but the book itself is very poor quality. The recipe titles and other accent text are printed in a difficult to read orange. I could get over that, but some of the titles aren't printed at all in my copy, and there are even entire pages that were left totally blank so I'm missing parts of recipes. I own many cookbooks at a comparable price range that don't have such glaring errors."
3,For my meat eating husband,"While changing to a Vegan diet, I found this book for my husband. It is just the two of us, so he picks what he wants from his book and I get to prepare good meals that are smaller in size. Keeps him happy, easier for me. L.Dowen"
4,Good but not great,"I bought this book following a recommendation from my girlfriend and yes, it's a good book, with good examples and ways to keep the menu interesting for the lone cooker. I still have to try more of the recipes but I feel this book is more for someone who already knows how to cook and is more interested in knowing how to make portions smaller. I didn't find the variety of recipes very interesting either."
5,Going Solo in the Kitchen,"Practical, informative information. I would highly recommend this book to anyone of any age who prepare meals only for themselves."
3,Just Okay,"Since I'm allergic to seafood, there's a whole chapter in here I can't cook...plus many recipes in the other sections have some type of seafood in it. However, the ones I CAN make are great!"
5,Recipes for ONE,This book is great for someone living alone and cooking is difficult. Lots of good things in the amount you want!
4,Why have I never seen these cookbooks?,I picked this cookbook because I am single. I like the recipes because they aren't all just meat and potatoes. I love the amounts. Even though I ALWAYS cook too much it's nice to cook a little too much instead of a LOT too much.
5,Great for someone living alone,"I bought this for my grandma, who lives alone and laments a lack of interesting things to eat. She was happy that the recipes were sized for her and when she tried a few said that they were good sizes and tasted great."
3,Questions about Digital Camera Battery Power Cable For Canon,"At the moment I cannot rate your item because you don't explain what it is!I am a semi-professional user of Canon Eos Cameras, I know them very well, and I live in Italy.I own Eos 10 + Eos 5 + Eos 10Digital and many Canon lenses, Flashes and genuine accessories.Sorry, but I cannot understand anything about your cable.I can see that connector is for giving power to such Flash models, and then?1) Is it a genuine ""Canon CP-E2 external Battery"" for Flash 550EX?2) Is it something similar from another maker?3) Is it something different?Why don't you explain better your item?Why don't you show a complete picture of your item?Otherway, nobody will buy something that is not explained hot to use it!Best regardsGuido"
3,Absent Dove,"Has all the ingredients for good family entertainment that cut across all ages and all races. I gave it 3-stars because I could not see Lee Majors in all 4 stories of Vol.1, even though his name appeared on the DVD heading."
5,Ratchets instead of muskets? Puleeze....,"Though the program is well-chosen, the musicianship is masterful, and the trumpets shine, a powderless ""Victory"" just doesn't cut it. Sure, it's a cheesy piece, but one of my favorites when it's done up to the nines--and that includes real cannon and muskets."
2,"Wonderful movie, bad source print","It's such a shame that a better source print for this film wasn't used. The picture and sound quality are fine but it is full of splices. My first VHS copy of this movie that I was able to find was originally released in 1987 by United American Video and was wonderful. Hardly any splices anywhere but the sound had some hiss. I found a 2nd VHS copy originally released in 1986 by Viking Video hoping the sound would be better. It was, but it has the identical splices as this new DVD version. It's very disappointing to have the actors lines ruined buy these cuts.If Alpha Video had done just a little more homework they could have found a better print for this DVD. This title deserves better."
5,Perfect Tea,"Yorkshire Tea by Taylors of Harrogate is a bold comforting tea. I've been a tea drinker forever (I'm not a kid) and this is the best tea I've ever found. I purchased some while in England and didn't try it until I came home. Well, it was used up immediately and I was so happy to find it on Amazon. I order it regularly. It makes a perfect pot of hot tea and also a wonderful iced tea. It is never bitter and holds it's flavor, hot or cold. I recommend it highly!"
4,Bright and delicious,"A good basic black tea, much better than any Lipton's. Tea bags have no string or tag, so have a strainer handy. I think I still like PG Tips better tho."
3,"Good tea, but not great","This is a very good tea, but does not outplace my favorite tea from the UK (PG Tips). I found the taste of the tea bag material to linger in the tea, so be careful not to let it steep any longer than needed. Yorkshire certainly is better tasting than the average US tea brands, so try it if you are looking for an upgrade, though I would also order a box of PG Tips for a treat!"
5,Just the Best,Very pleased with Yorkshire Tea. We've been using Yorkshire Gold and find this to be a better value of excellent quality. Altogether an outstanding blend of English tea.
3,Warm up first before watching!,"Dvd arrived quickly, and is easy to follow - though you should really warm up first - as some of the exercises are quite intense and she gets right into it straight away. Not a beginners dvd - I think you need to be aware of your ability and watch the exercises first before attempting them. Good value especially as it is twice the price in the shops. Good for a quick blast if you don't have time to do a proper exercise dvd."
2,Ehh...,I thought this would've been cool when I wanted to kick my Pilates practice up a notch but the band was just awkward. I didn't like it one bit.
4,"Great workout video, but........",I really enjoy this workout video and after several weeks of doing it 3 times a week I haven't gotten tired of it. My only complaint is not with the video itself but with the included band. It is horrible!!! It sticks to itself and I spend more time getting the band ready to use than I do actually doing the workout. It is a pain to have to stop in between each workout to straighten the band back out into semi-usable form. If you have the option to get just the video without the band go for it and just purchase a band from another store.
3,She talks too much,"The exercises are interesting and have added value, but the instructor is impossible. She just does not stop talking even when it is unnecessary. I will never buy any of her DVD's as she is so Annoying."
5,tried and true,I received this cd about 2 yrs. ago and use it on a fairly regular basis. It was instrumental in helping me to trim down and firm up my muscles after loosing some weight. I don't know that it's helpful for a weight loss solution alone but great for toning certain areas and strengthening areas of our body that get neglected. It is not aerobic and does not increase your heart rate much at all. I do not get bored with the 5 - 10 min. routines and Suzanne is a pleasant instructor. She does a few moves that I doubt I will ever be able to do at my ago of 60. Using the band that is supplied you'll be able to keep adding strength to your workout without buying new equipment. I have purchased other bands with more resistance since then to increase my workouts beyond but it wasn't necessary. I am confident you will benefit for this workout. You'll see results and your body will feel better.
3,Good for beginners,I am new to pilates and I find this DVD is easy to follow and yet challenging. I have not made it through the entire 50 minutes but it is getting easier. I also lke it because you can set up your own routine in whatever order you choose. Some reviewers have mentioned that the band is cheap but I think it works well for this application. The instructor in pleasant and encouraging.
4,Doable exercises...and they work.,"Very good program, especially if one does not have much room. Common sense along with easy exercises, well demonstrated too."
3,Slim and Sculpt Pilates-with Pilates Band .,"I think this Pilates DVD works for me . It effectively gives me some good results after a few weeks . Working out with Suzanne Bowen , giving me a pleasure to follow her instruction easily ."
1,Not Good,The instructor is often hard to follow because it takes time to figure out how she is positioning the band. The workout has no flow to it. I found the whole thing ackward.
1,Not for beginners,"I ordered this DVD expecting it to have beginner Pilates on it. I was wrong. The routines were too fast and too hard to follow. While I've done Pilates, this is not a tape for those that are beginners. Truly disappointed."
1,Decided to Donate This DVD,I was not too happy with this DVD; I felt it was not what I was looking for and I decided to donate it after viewing....
4,good workout,I really enjoy this video. I do pilates in a studio (mat and reformer) and this is a tough workout. Really feel like you can get something accomplished in the 10 minute segments.
4,Tough Pilates Workout!!!!,I just tried this DVD for the first time last night and I can definitely say that I am feeling it this morning! This is definitely a more advanced pilates workout than most due to the use of the resistance band which I think is GREAT! It definitely makes the moves much more challenging. I will definitely be adding this DVD to my workout routine.
5,worth watching again and again,"patient teacher, slow motion allowing for memorization and exercise in front of tv. working at your own pace, daily or 3 times a week, this CD is a good reminder of what exercise done in concentration can do for your body!"
3,Not a huge fan of the toning band,"I've become very interested in pilates after trying Suzanne Bowen's Pilates Perfect Body, but I'm not as psyhced about this DVD as I am the other one.While the toning band works great in some segments, really giving you something to resistant against or assist in form and balance, other times it seems to just be in the way. That was definitely annoying, and if I couldn't figure out band placement to be able to mimic the move, I would just toss it aside and do a quick set of moves from her other DVD until she was finished.The moves are fast paced and enjoyable though. At times I would get to the end of a segment and not even notice that 10 minutes had gone by. I will definitely add this into my workout schedule, but I have a feeling I'll be going back to Suzanne's other DVD more frequently than this one."
5,Pilates tape with band,"I'm sure the band must make a difference in the pilates tape. It puts much stress on the exercise you are doing. I like the 10 minute tapes because you can pick which exercise you want to concentrate on & in the order you want to use them. If I don't have time to use the whole tape I just pick a few & always end with the cool down. The instructor is good at explaining (& if you are new at it you improve every time you use it).It takes time to perfect some of the exercises (I am new to the band), but practice makes perfect."
2,Band Seems to Mostly Just Hinder Workout,"I started working out with the Ana Caban pilates dvds and wanted to try out a little variety. I purchased this dvd hoping to alternate it with my other pilates dvds and was excited to incorporate the band into some of the moves. I was disappointed, however, when just about every single move uses the band and I often found myself more distracted by it than actually focusing on getting a good workout.With Ana Caban's dvds the time seems to fly by and at the end I feel as though I got a good workout. As I tried out this dvd, I found myself relieved when the end of a segment finally came and it seemed almost never-ending as I tried to get through all five. There were certainly some good poses and instruction that were pointed out in the dvd where I learned a little something about pilates, but overall I felt bored with the workout and frustrated/hindered attempting to incorporate the band."
3,great pilates,I loved the exercise and I sweat. the only problem I had was the band would not stay flat the way she shows but it kind of rolls under my arch of the foot and makes it hard to use it and follow her. maybe I am not doing it right. a lil to fast to follow.
5,"Great video, very simple",I thought this was a very good video. I have tried other pilates videos (i.e. Winsor Pilates) and I hated it. I am a beginner to excercise and I am very picky about the instructor's personality. I thought Suzanne Bowen did a great job. I have yet to find her annoying. I really like using the band as well. Another bonus that the band comes with the DVD so nothing extra to buy.
4,Great for busy moms!,"I have been a pilates fan for years and years. This video doesn't present as big of a challenge as I was hoping for, but it still provides a good mini-workout. As a busy mom, it is great to be able to grab a 10 minute ab session (upper body, lower body, etc) when I find myself with a few extra minutes during the day. This can't substitute a full workout(unless you chose to complete multiple sessions), but it is an excellent supplement."
4,"Will do, but have had better","This product is creamy and easy. It is pretty good if you have never had the real thing. If you can make it from scratch, but if you can't make it from this mix. Use skim milk rather than 2% or whole to lighten it up, otherwise it is too heavy."
4,Good Product,While this 'brulee' doesn't have much flavor (compared to other brands I've tried)...it is VERY creamy in taste and texture. Overall....good product for the price.
5,Superb Collection of Adoption Stories,"Ms. Robinson has amassed a large collection of work from 75 respected poets, authors and playwrights, all of whom have one thing in common--an adoption connection. Some, like the father of former basketball star Issac Berg, and myself, adopted children, many internationally. Others, like Paula Friedman of California, were birthparents. Still others were themselves adopted as children. It is a privilege to have my work included in this edition, whose writers hail from many racial and religious backgrounds, yet sing in chorus: We can all learn from one another, and from the adoption experience. Alyssa A. Lappen"
5,Not Alone,"As the author of four poems in this anthology, I can now say that I don't feel alone anymore. Each poem, each story I read, I am compelled to read a second time. Every time I pick up this book, it feels like I'm picking up a part of my life. I recommend this book to anyone ready to delve into the heart of adoption."
5,Touched By Adoption,"As an adoptive aunt, I found this book compelling reading. More important, my adopted niece recognized herself within the pages and was moved by the experience. This was a perfect gift for Patty, and I highly recommend it to others!Terryl Paiste, Fairfax, Virginia"
5,Touched by Touched by Adoption,"I read this book over Christmas and found it to be in keeping with the season. I enjoyed the poetry and the story ""Stupid"" by Sarah Freligh. I recommend this book for everyone!"
4,Note to Ligotti Fans,"nothing bad to say about this collection, but DO NOTE that it is almost entirely comprised of reprints from his earlier releases; if you think you'll be getting a book full of new ligotti horror, think again..."
2,Boeing puff piece,"This book is one of those internally generated corporate propaganda publications, in which each former corporate president or CEO is a towering, moralistic and unassailable figure. The book abounds with tales of eager employees working overtime without pay, as well as stories about shrewd corporate executives running circles around the competition. You will find a bit of general information about Boeing in this publication. But if your intent is to really learn more about this fascinating company and its history, there are far better books available on Amazon.com."
5,Great guitar....regardless of the price.,"I just got this guitar today, and played it for 3 hours straight. It looks great, and sounds even better. Once I tuned it up, it held a tune the whole time I played. I have a Dean Exotica that is much more expensive, and bought this one as my practice guitar. In all honesty, this one might actually have a better sound. This is a great guitar for the money. It arrived very well packaged, and is a major upgrade from my old practice guitar (Gibson Maestro). Dean has a great line up of guitars, and this one is no exception. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a solid beginner or intermediate guitar."
1,Waste of time and of money!!!,"The guitar looks beautiful. My guitar came with no picks or a pitch pipe. I had to send it back and get a replacement guitar, and the replacement guitar came with no picks or a pitch pipe. It was out of tune and the string were loose. It was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend this guitar to anyone. It has no way to hook the guitar up to an amp or the computer. I was very disappointed. I'm not happy with the purchase. WASTE OF MONEY!"
5,christmas gifts,this was a christmas gift and thats exactly what the person wanted and they were very happy to get it..
4,A basic Karate course in a single book.,"Karate-Do covers the history of Karate from it's roots in ancient Greece all the way to modern day. Though this book was last printed in 1975, it's concise style is accurate and complete enough for any beginner or experienced martial artist. This book is complete with numerous photographs of techniques complete with multiple angles as well as technical drawings. All in all it is an excellent technical manual for any Karateka."
5,A wonderful total body workout!,"I love this workout DVD! In 45 minutes, David really works your entire body - and makes you sweat. It's one of my favorite workouts, and I highly recommend it. I would recommend getting his book, ""Sound Mind, Sound Body"" to compliment this DVD."
5,A kick-ass advanced workout!,"Heed the reviews! This is an advanced workout! There is a lot of jumping and strength moves (ie push-ups) that will be very, very challenging to the beginning exerciser. For the intermediate/advanced - it's great. Using 5 pounds is probably the maximum amount of weight you can use, without causing any injury. This workout combines cardio strength moves, isometrics with the basics - squat thrusts, push-ups, crumches...etc. You do feel energized after doing it! David is a great motivator and not annoying at all. In fact he is quite funny: ""Your butt...IT'S STINGING!"" My only complaint is the music. It sucks. I wish the music wasn't so wimpy for such an intense workout. Also he does tend to speed up near the end of each set of exercises, but what can I say...he's pumped up!! Other than that...let this workout change your body and your attitude."
4,"Challenging, Time-Efficient Workout","I feel I get a complete strength training workout, and it keeps my heart rate up with some cardio moves mixed in. I also like that he does a bunch of different exercises, which prevents boredom, and that they work multiple muscles at once. You get a full-body workout in 45 minutes. I agree with some of the other reviewers - his cueing definitely needs improvement, and some of his mind-body connection statements can sound a little hokey. Overall, however, I feel it is an effective workout, and I feel accomplished afterward."
5,The video is great!,"Mr. Kirsch created a great at-home workout. While not the easiest workout, it is definitely one that will produce results. In the two weeks I have used the workout I have noticed changes in my body. I already had to go out and buy smaller pants. It is also great not to have to use anything but my weights, and the beach setting helps me feel more relaxed.What has made the biggest change is following this video along with the diet and nutrition advice Mr. Kirsch gives in his book. The recipes are delicious and I love the fact that I do not feel as if I am on a diet.Thank you Mr. Kirsch!"
3,David Kirsch is brilliant...but this workout isn't,"This video is full of great moves that will get your heart rate up and work your muscles, but it's impossible to follow! David doesn't explain how to do the moves properly, switches between exercises with no warning, and often loses count or speeds up/slows down in the middle of a set. You're better off getting his book ""Sound Mind, Sound Body"" and following at your own pace."
2,Not worth it,"Initially this seemed like a real good buy. After using it for a week, I switched back to my older Casio calculator. The biggest problem with this Sharp is that the keys are awful: if you write 123, you press 1, then wait one second, then press 2, then wait 1 second, then press 3. In all, you end up typing in extremely slowly because if you press the keys in quick succession, this calculator simply stops registering your input. If you're an advanced calculator user, you'd want to be able to type fast and without looking at the screen. This will not happen on this calculator. Often, I'd type too fast and not realize I was missing digits or brackets, which gives wrong answers. This extremely frustrating machine will give you a headache fast. It gets 2 stars because otherwise it has the same features as your average graphing calculator."
5,Nice and shiny,"These are beautiful looking ear rings that are much better looking in person. They are clear, and sparkle with no inclusions. They are a 1/4 cttw each (total 1/2) and the size is just right for everyday wear. They aren't too big, but noticeable. You'll love them."
2,Disappointing remixes on good songs.,"I bought this CD because I believe in heart-rendering patriotism and good country music. What I got was a couple of good songs, a few lesser-known decent songs, and two horrible remixed renditions of two of my favorite songs. A totally-tamed version of Hank William's Jr.'s ""America Will Survive"" and a powerpuff version of Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the USA"" had me taking this CD out of the player and putting it on the shelf. I say give us the original versions of songs when you promote a compilation CD like this - don't tease us with lame remake music."
4,Great CD,I buy many CD's to use when I put on programs at a local Adult Home. I was pleased with the songs found on the Patriotic County CD and with most of their vocal arrangements. The people at the Home enjoyed them with me. You will not be disappointed if you choose this CD for yourself.
1,are you kidding?,"you certainly must be, go listen to norah jones, not this redneck trailer dump album"
1,Zero Star for EXTREME PATRIOTISM!,Commercial country music is for sure a backward CRAP art. Extreme NATIONALISM becomes religion and dangerous too. Nationalism is great when is in the right amount and when the respect for other people and nations are there. EXTREME NATIONALISM reminds me NAZI GERMANY where people were brain washed by the EXTREM NATIONALIST party and the FLAG was all over. Even inside the toilet. ZERO STAR because I think EXTREME NATIONALISM is sick.
1,Patriotic? Schmatriotic! Just more disgusting Nationalism!,"Couldn't stomach the extremely nationalistic, God-is-with-us! attitude. My neighbor plays it with the window open (probably to amuse his pitbull). Since he also flies a confederate (lower case on purpose) flag (sic), I take it that he has some attitude toward some of my friends who do not shine the same color as he (like sickly pale). Culturally, we have become like all morons who support dictatorial governments, reveling in cheap, nationalistic music like this. It disgusts me that anyone would sell junk like this."
1,One of the worst cds ever,"Reading the reviews of this cd really makes me sad. People actually listen and defend this trash. Some of these reviews are unbelievable. But i guess I'm just a liberal america hating commie....A great American entertainer was silenced by foreigners whose religion attacked this country... [their religion attacked us??, different skin/language doesn't make you a foreigner, racist/xenophobe!]...If you feel so compelled to blast music with a social and political agenda, then why don't you do so with music that has lyrics that has been proven to cause youths to commit homicide...... [which music is that again??, if you're worried about homicide maybe you oughta look towards Iraq, nevermind they're just foreigners who cares]...by the way, i love the United States"
4,Great music for a very worthwhile cause!,"This is an excellent album with a variety of music. Despite some of the strange ""hate America"" reviews, several of the songs have absolutely nothing to do with ""nationalism."" Some of the songs are about things like missing loved ones, about being far away from family and friends. I'd like to suggest that reviewers stick to the topic at hand: the review of the music on this CD -- and leave the political rhetoric and hatefulness to more appropriate venues."
5,Charlie Daniels Should Not Have Been Silenced,"When Charlie Daniels came to Dearborn, Michigan he was advised not to sing, ""This Ain't No Rag, It's A Flag"" due to the Muslim population there. A great American entertainer was silenced by foreigners whose religion attacked this country. Foreigners taking away the freedom of speech of a true American singer. All I can say is, keep on singing the song Charlie! Even if you come back to Dearborn, we want to hear it! AMERICANS LOVE IT!!"
4,That seals it,"DanD and captainarcher,Well said. I can't understand where race, color, creed, or religion come in to this CD.I was simply searching for SOME place I could find a legal copy of ""Mr. President"" by the Warren Brothers.After reading SOME of the mindless ranting in these reviews I am buying this CD. I agree that it could be better in some ways (and Nora Jones does rock, sometimes).I have heard most of these songs seperately and like several (sorry but too much of anything <God Bless The USA> can be bad).Please do note readers that MOST of the negative bashing of this CD has come from MUSICFAN (who could benefit from a spellchecker and a ticket home).Off to place my order thanks for the good reviews..."
5,A Must For Anyone Needing Help With Their Money,"This book really impressed me with the legal help I was searching for. Inheriting money with no knowledge of business, it really helped me with the questions I needed answered and many more I hadn't even thought of. It was ordered for our library and after reading it, I ordered one right away so I could add it to my library and start setting up my estate right. A must for any person needing legal advice and knowledge how to manage his investments."
3,Not so useful nowadays,"I bought this book to use it as a reference book, but never had the chance to apply the stuff in it, which is sort in the early stages of this theory."
4,One slight issue,"This is a great cutter, but in my unit, the two holes that allow you to integrate it with a Logan ruler were not screw-threaded, so I could not lock the two units together (as they are designed to do). Reaching out to the manufacturer on this, but otherwise works well."
4,Good buy,"The product itself is of very good quality. There are no directions, however, so I had to look up how to use it on wikihow.com . It also does not come with the metal ruler so important to cutting a mat. I guess it is what it is, a matte cutter, but you'd better know how to do it, and you better have steady hands."
3,Handy tool. Takes some practice.,"Handy tool. Takes some practice but you can get good results. Good build quality. Not always easy to run cutter butted tight to a straight edge. This can result in some spoiled attempts. For improved performance, go for the more expensive cutter and guide/T square, all in one."
4,smooth WOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I've always dug Babyface. the Brother had the Smooth Slow Jams and he grew as a Solo Artist after writing and Producing for others and a whose who of Acts in the Industry. His videos were cool as well. Face always kept things on the smooth tip and he never sounded trendy as he was his own trend. a Good Solid collection here. Face has left a lasting mark.
5,I Could Completely Relate,"I thought that this book was great. I received it as a gift during my illness. As a 19 year old, battling ovarian cancer, I could relate to every part. It always made me laugh and put a smile on my face. I am now in remission and still sit down often and read the book. I always read it completely in one sitting because it is so good that I can never put it down or walk away. It puts things into perspective and helps to lighten the situation. I recommend it to everyone and am going to buy it for my friend who also has ovarian cancer. To Susan- thanks for the laughs and inspiration."
5,Written by a dear friend,This book was written by an old friend of mine; a woman with more grace and love of living than anyone else I have ever known. Reading it always brings a smile.
5,Good product,"Nice setup - works well, only difficulty was entering the encytpion password to match the access point. Seemed to take two or three entries before it remembered it."
5,Great Help,"I found these items to be extremely helpful. After spending hours holding my kids in the pool, we all completely enjoyed and appreciated the freedom these items offered the kids in the pool. And the price is right."
4,very revealing research /conclusions,this text exhibits strong research methodology and interesting conclusions about perceptionsand how they are related to ethnicity.
4,AN EXCITING PRISON MOVIE,"A NEW YOUNG JAIL GUARD BECOMES FRIENDS WITH AN EX-LAWYER PRISONER AND THROUGH HIM MEETS + FALLS IN LOVE WITH THE PRISONER'S SISTER. THE WARDEN IS A CRUEL,VICIOUS PERSON WHO RAPES THE SISTER WHO COMMITS SUICIDE. AFTER SO MANY VIOLENT ACTS COMMITED BY THE WARDEN THIS FINALLY TURNS ON HIM AND HIS LOYAL GUARDS AS THE INMATES RIOT AND SEEK JUSTICE"
5,great timing,"I was just about to mail off some gifts when I noviced this item haad arrived, I like it some much I kept it for myself!"
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this product to assist me in making my homemade beef jerky. When I received it, it didn't work. The power switch lights up but the slicing wheel won't turn"
3,Haven't even used it yet,"I haven't even used my machine yet, but I was disappointed to see the serrated blade when the product description here indicates a ""smooth blade,"" which is what I was looking for. Maybe it will still work for what I want to use it for, but it's disappointing to not get what you think is coming. I also don't like reading that it's meant for less than 10 minute intervals."
2,food slicer,"It's not possible to slice, e.g., prosciutto thin, as the cutting guide on this machine bends, and doesn't align properly.it works for thicker slices and bread cutting.disappointed.maybe shouldn't expect more for the price."
1,waring slicer.,Not a good product does not spin fast enough to cut anything all it does is mulch the meat i do not recommend this product . JUNK !!!
1,does not do the job,I tried to slice both a roast and a proscuitto into thin slices and was unable to do either properly. When the meat passed the leading edge of the blade it slowed the motor down signifigantly by pressing on the full surface of the blade. I could not get one full slice out of that machine. I will try to return it and look for a better one to buy. It is useless for the purpose I bought it for.
1,Light intermittent household use at best.,"Stainless-steel and die-cast aluminum construction promises performance, but the undersized electric motor limits this slicer to very light intermittent household use. The Waring FS800 Pro Electric Food Slicer seems to have a barely adequate motor when brand new with a new sharp blade. Just think how it will perform when the blade gets a little dull. This is definitely not a professional quality food slicer, it is only a light intermittent duty slicer at best."
4,Great Value,"This is a upscale home owner unit. Slices London broil for Jerky, 5 or 6 lbs at a crack. Does a great job on 3 or 4 lb. Pit Beef. Would give it 5 Stars if it had a blade sharpner, they say it doesnt need one. We will see. G.C."
5,a great scare for a little kid,"My 2-yr-old daughter adores this story. I picked it out at the library, because she really enjoys scary things. She's had me read it every night. In addition to a well-written story with a marvelous cadence, there are beautiful illustrations to discuss on each page. We play an ""I spy"" game of locating the cats in each illustration. I would not necessarily recommend this for the average 2-yr-old, but I feel it is quite appropriate for the age range specified."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"The Tiki Stool is an excellent example of modern art. It's also very strong. When I used it as a step stool, it had no problems supporting my 190lbs. You may not be able to determine from the picture, but the Tiki Stool is made of hard plastic. Again, a great product!"
4,"Great product, arrived a little damaged",My bird and I love this cage. It is well constructed and a real steal for the price you pay. Mine came a little damaged. A few things were bent and the tray had a some chip out of it but it was minor and I loved it so much I fixed it and kept it.
4,Julie's Review,"This cage is well worth the price I paid for it. It is pretty strong, but probably shouldn't be used for a large or particularly destructive parrot. It is nice and spacious for my tiny parrotlet, and would also accommodate one or two of the medium parrots like cockatiels or conures nicely. I have a feeling I'm going to have it for quite a long time. :)"
4,Good product,"I got this cage for my Conure and it is fine, not great like my CA cage but at 1/3 the price it is a good value. I wouldn't trust it for a large bird though it isn't very strong."
4,Pre-Heligoat album offers no trouble whatsoever!,"I ran into this band because i caught the Heligoats opening up for Clem Snide many a years back now. Chris Otepka *is* the Heligoats and he made mention of how he was in a band prior to this and how he wanted to move into something different. So, there is the breakdown...now about THIS album; to my ears you can hear where he evolved from into his Heligoats persona. Penturbia has quirky songs about migraines and work and other assorted good jingly jangly bits.Troubled Hubble is certainly more of a band scene and you can feel it in the music.If you enjoy weirder slices of pop with quirky lyrics, you will not go wrong on this album. I found it easy to get into and was singing the songs within a few days."
5,"he's Baaaack! less ballsy...sort of, blue as ever and funny as heck!","Great to have Robert Schimmel back! He is blue...and dirty and driven by sexual desire and able to express it in the most funny and original way. Schimmel faced cancer 8 years ago and is back to pick up where he left off with his gut splitting takes on marriage , divorce and sexual mores. Schimmel hits all the right notes for the adult viewer/listener and even manages to be a bit serious and heartfelt at times. The bonus 20 minute deli interview is a big plus as is the short 5 minute making of."
2,Wished I knew this would work out!!,First of all the display numbers and letters started to fade..the battery didn't last long at all not compared to the other brands that I used before. Seems I have to recharge it every minute and can't talk a long time on the phone..just not a good model I love the features but I need a better phone.
4,Good deal for the price,"Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive phones, but does the job. Sound quality excellent."
2,You get what you pay for,"Brought phone for the kids to use, its ok for short conversation. For some reason when your on the phone for a few minutes, here comes the static."
4,VTech ia5847,I assumed this phone had a speakerphone option when I purchased it only to find out when I received it that it does not. The phone in all other regards is perfect. I just really miss being able to use that speakerphone.
1,I'm throwing it out.,"We bought this phone b/c a previous vtech phone served us well. This one, however is just missing too many key features that I took for granted. For instance, there is no speaker phone feature (was great for when I was put on hold) and the ringer volume control only works if you press it WHILE the phone is ringing, and then resets to ""loud"" for the next call - in my house the phone keeps waking up the baby and I can't set any handset or the base to silent mode. Also, switching to pick up call waitibg is a crapshoot, you never know if you will disconnect one or both people. If you want a totally stripped down phone, this might work for you. For anyone else, it's a step down."
2,Vtech phone,"Retunred unit. One battery worked, one didn't and was having a hard time trying to replace the battery, which I shouldn't have had to do, decided I really didn't need it."
1,Terrible Phone,"Bought this phone package, and everything was ok for about 3 weeks. Then, for no apparent reason, the phone began to experience very noisy static - to the point that you cannot hear the other person unless they are yelling.This seemed to occur primarily if you move farther than 5 to 10 ft from the base unit. Switching through all available channels, and researching online at V-tech's website led to no solutions to correct the problem.After researching for a replacement, it is clear that all of the negative comments about this phone are justified. Given it's almost non-functioning state, it deserves a zero rating."
1,Horrible Phone!,"You can't be on both handsets at the same time, i.e. 2 people can't pick up to simultaneously speak to the caller - calls have to be ""transfered"" from one handset to the other via a ""transfer"" button! They don't tell you this in the description, but now you know why it's so cheap! Pay the extra and get a better model, one where you can be on both handsets simultaneously!"
2,Disappointing,"This is one of the oddest, unprofessional, books I've ever purchased. Instead of appearing to be collaborators, these authors wrote portions of each chapter and gave each other credit for each portion. There are multiple sections with different titles and attributions to each author. There are a few illustrations in the book - all drawn by hand. The book also has no index and no references."
1,very disappointing,"I puchased this for my father. We tried it on 3 phones in his home. The volume never increased on any of the phones. Attempting to return it has been very frustrating. It was a week before the distributor returned an e-mail. Three weeks later, the issue has still not been resolved. Not a lot of money, but the principal of the matter remains. It was very difficult to contact the distributor!"
1,BAD NEWS,"Got the first one batteries were dead. Put in new ones worked for 5 min.went dead. Sent it back for exchange (excellent service from amazon)second one came with dead batteries also. Put in new ones, worked but almost no gain on or off! I gave up on it!"
3,Speaker Phone Feedback,The device provided adequate amplification. However when used with the speaker phone function (hand set hung up) the device caused severe feedback on the line. The feedback stopped when I removed the amplifier so I know the amplifier was the source of the feedback.
2,i wish i did not buy this one,"it's not really that helpful to me.. It just created more doubts about what it is written here, but I am giving it to someone that might interested.."
2,An Unknown Piece,"The orchestral music is very moving and very well performed. While I am a long-time fan of opera, the choral contribution to Corigliano's First left me cold. If I had realized how much of it there was I probably would not have made the purchase.As an aside, the jewel box was smashed in transit, which is not an infrequent problem when ordering CD's and DVD's from Amazon."
4,"A great, overall view of North Korea","When my son chose to do a report on North Korea, we had to scramble for resources. Not a lot is known about the country. This book provided a broad general overview of just about all aspects of the country, society and people. It wasn't as in depth in some areas, but excellent overall."
1,The Voice is a Shadow of its Former Self,"This CD is of interest only as a example of what age does to a voice and perhaps the desire for the applause to continue long after public performance should stop. Go for the early Price - a beautiful, beautiful voice."
1,I wanted to like it but could not.,I had trouble with this book because it is poorly written. I love both hatha yoga and walking so I hoped that this book would have something to offer.You might like it if you are not picky about good writing and you enjoy inspirational life stories.
4,Read at your own danger,"If you aren't a doctor or biologist this book will be hard for you to understand. Ecological Dynamics of Tick-Borne Zoonoses is a good book to find out about Tick-Borne Zoonoses, if you don't know what that is dont read this.This book holds great information about ticks"
2,Heavy on problems but light on solutions,"I know the importance of good strong male mentors for young men, so I was eager to read this book.Unfortunately, the author seemed to take his entire book talking about the problems that this generation of young men faces. He spent very little time talking of solutions. When he got to the end of the book, he said basically, ""if you want more practical solutions, buy my teaching/study series""."
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL MEN IN THE CHURCH,Mr. Bundschuh has hit the nail on the head. Chrisitan MEN need to be building up and raising Christian boys into manhood. His politically incorrect style is a refreshing change to the watered down authors of recent times.
1,"Cheap looking, no certificate/COA","These are very cheap looking earrings. There was no COA/certificate which, on a ~$1,000 diamond pair of earrings seems very strange to me. The clasp on the pair I received was bent, and the prong on the other earring was actually slightly crooked. The diamonds didn't look like G-H near colorless to my eyes as they seemed to have a yellowish tint, but I'm no grader so I can't take that part as too much of a negative. Of course, that is part of the problem -- there's absolutely nothing that states what these earrings are or that they are in fact VS2 grade. There is no certificate, no IGI, not even a basic COA. (There's also no hallmark on the earrings -- I guess because they are too small? Which means they could even be white gold and cubics...)Overall though, they just look and feel cheap -- and that's the real problem. I returned mine."
1,Rip off!!,bought these in 2009. My wife started to have an allergic reaction to them. took them to a jeweler to replace the posts. they promptly told me that they were cubic zirchromium on a base metal posts. This is a high-end professional company. They tried to keep it quiet in the store because I was pretty upset that I paid this much for paste!
2,Boring and Trite,Well...I got it...I wish I could return it. Good bathroom book. That's about it. save your cash.
1,A Good Read Spoiled,"This is not John Feinstein. This could have been a great read BUT there is NO substance! I am not sure that I learned a single thing about the tour from reading this book. Golf magazines provide more information than this guy - who seems to have relied on very weak interviews and a lot of soft second hand stories.Note: the jacket cover has all the substance you are going to find in this book and even then you have heard most of them!PLEASE NOTE: This guy reviewed his own book as""exceptionally informative... and insightful"", something it is clearly not!Don't waste your money!"
4,Good Insider Stuff on Tournament Week,"Breezy, easy to read anecdotal insights into what goes on inside and outside the ropes at golf tournaments. This is a real light summer read with some new stuff on competitive golf. I liked it."
2,Sliced For a Double Bogey,"Just like the drive that starts right down the middle, then slices way off to the right, this book is a letdown.It promises such great things, inside the ropes of the best golfers. It doesn't deliver, but rather just provides collected anecdotes, rather than real first hand observation, interview, etc.Suggest turn to some great golf writing on the topic, e.g. Lorne Rubenstein's ""Links:An Exploration"" of which Greg Norman says this is one of rare journalists who understands the tour, and John Feinstein's ""The Majors."""
5,Great combination of music and collectibles,"This IS the CD with the 11 Pokemon cards. What a greatpackage! There are 5 holofoils: Charizard, Blastoise, Venasaur,Snorlax & Porygon, plus promotional cards of the very rare Mew, Mewtwo, and Arcanine. Also included are 2 promotional Japanese trainer cards and an American Pikachu. The CHARIZARD, VENUSAUR & BLASTOISE cards each have a promo ""LIGHTNING BOLT"" stamp in the right corner, below the picture. MEW & MEWTWO each have a ""POKEBALL"" stamp in the same corner. WHAT A GREAT SET!"
4,Best Collection (Import),My cd came with eleven promo cards - all wonderful - and beautifully packaged....I wonder if this one does? 6 stars if it does....
3,Great but doesn't match the photo,"A great little stand for your biOrb, biUbe or Marineland Hex5 fish tank.One important note however, the photo used doesn't accurately portray what you'll receive.The upright column is actually a matte gray more akin to PVC than the polished chrome you see in the photo.The back of the stand is actually composed of two flat black boards, not a solid piece as depicted above. As a result the chords coming down from your tank will be dangling visibly taking away from the slick presentation you're hoping for.That said, it's still a nice little stand."
4,Into the mind of a serial killer...,"What a brutal, gory movie - for intense gore fans ONLY. Do not get this DVD if you're the LEAST bit squeamish. Brought to you by Joerg Buttgereit, creator of ""Nekromantik"", this is a raw, bloody look at a pretty twisted guy named Lothar Schramm. Though the movie itself is relatively short (only a little over an hour), this DVD is packed with goodness - extras aplenty here, folks. I'm rather pleasantly surprised it's even here, as Nekromantik wasn't available here last I checked. In conclusion, if you think you can handle the rather disturbing subject matter of the film, by all means, grab this baby while you can... it'll be worth your money."
2,A big letdown for me,"I have scene people say that this film is truly shocking, but if you are a true horror fan all I have to say is skip it. Made by the director of two of the most shocking films ever made. His name is Jorg Buttgereit the infamous director of the Nekromantik films. This one is about the serial lipstick killer, and one would think he would have done a good job with this true and evil sicko, but I say it is horrible. I hope he does better next film."
3,Worth the viewing...,"If you're a serial killer buff, just as i am, you'lllike Schramm.it has some slow spots, but does deliver the goods(and bads) >:-) when necessary.its not very long, but it does provide some insight of the ticking of the s.killer's mind.Its more a 3.5 than a 3 tho.Check it out."
2,INCOMPETENT,"What may have started out as an interesting premise...ends up as an uninteresting mess of a serial killer flick.If only the filmmaker had spent more time developing his storyline and his characters, instead of trying to shock...it may have resulted in a better film."
3,Correction to [Amazon.com] Review,I think the scale works well. I'm not reviewing the quality.This scale is not accurate to the tenth of a pound as stated in the [Amazon.com] Review. It is accurate to the half pound.
4,consistent quality,"Consistently good. That sums up Bonnie Raitt's albums for me. Actually, some are better than plain good, bordering on outstanding, but at least you can always rest assured that her albums will be of consistently good quality ... and ""Home Plate"" is no exception. Listen to those first two tracks (""What Do You Want the Boy to Do"" and ""Good Enough""), take a deep breath and smile: yes, the lady delivers in the clutch again. Typical Bonnie Raitt: bluesy and soulful tunes mixed with rockers and sweet, melodic ballads. And she performs her usual magic on the guitar to up the ""wow"" factor. What more can she do? This album does indeed cover all the bases. ""Home Plate"" may not be Bonnie's MVP album, but the batting average here is very high!"
1,cd skips,the cd was inexpensive enough but it skips. what good is a cd that skips no matter what you pay for it.
1,false advertiseing,"Read the reviews on this product before you buy. I also received a product that was not what was pictured in the add, with a copyrite date of 2006, which as I understand in a previous post is the actual production date of the product. I probaly wont sent this product back to the seller because of cost, but I will not buy from this vender again."
4,Great value...but not like the picture.,"Great points: Original Energizer manufactured batteries, priced right. They are holding up just fine so far.Caution: They come in small blister packs of 5 (not as shown in the ad). There are no expiration dates on the packaging so you are not aware of how old the batteries are. This is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating"
3,"So far, ok","As others have said, the actual delivered batteries are not packaged as pictured. It's still too soon to report how long they a actually last."
2,Not what I ordered but it will work,I ordered 2 of these therefore I should have gotten 24 packs of 2. However what I got was 9 packs of 5 and additional 3 to make up 48 total. I SPECIFICALLY ordered the double pack but that is NOT what I got.I will make do with what I was sent as I don't want to go through the hassle of returns and I NEED the batteries now but buyer beware - it is NOT what they advertise...
5,Great Deal! Batteries Last!,"These batteries are great. They did not come in the packaging shown, rather they came wrapped in foil, but they're still Energizer batteries. I paid $14 for 24 batteries which is an excellent deal, in-store I would pay about $2.50 EACH for these! Would definitely recommend buying in bulk if you have several gadgets that use these batteries. I get roughly 6 months of battery life out of each battery (on my watch & pedometer), so I expect these to last a long time. Definitely buying these in bulk again!"
1,came in 5 battery packs,"came in 5 battery packs, different from the 2 packs in item description and picture. They are still Energizer but I don't know if they'd be as good as the 2 pack ones. Unhappy with incorrect item description."
5,Master of the keys,"What a wonderful musical journey this album takes the listener on!Eloy offers us an absolutely melodious work, obviously, to the use of a true arsenal of keyboards. In general it consists of compositions very well elaborated that come closer to the atmospheric odysseys of Vangelis and Jarre, as well as to the long electronic-progressive passages of Rick Wakeman.

5,Amazing,Great book. Must read for someone who has lost a loved one. I highly recommend this book & can't wait to meet her in a few weeks.
3,Don't confuse this with the Icon Version!,"Note that there are two 'For Beginner's' series, one by Icon Books, and another (this one) from Readers and Writers. The Jung for Beginners by Icon Books is excellent, highly recommended. If you can find it..."
5,Fun Jung,"This book is a great introduction to a set of ideas that compliments most people's thinking. After reading it, you will not be an expert, but you'll see the world a little differently, question some of your previous held beliefs, and be able to hold yr. own or better in some conversations with well-educated people."
1,Horrible! Take your money and feed pigeons instead.,"It is rare when I can find nothing good to say about a book. This is one of those times. The writing style is primitive, the organization of contents non-existent, and technical information provided either trivial,misleading or wrong. The book is currently unavailable. I hope it stays that way. Speaking probabilistically,any source of information on Jung is likely to be more useful than this one.Similarly, anything else you could think of to do with your money would give you more pleasure than reading this book. The author has good credentials. Why he published this is an enigma.A true waste of trees."
5,An excellent tool for ethics practitioners,"For those of us who are struggling, or who have struggled with the daily issues of establishing or runnning an ethics office, Driscoll and Hoffman's offering is a welcome arrival. By not only laying out the framework for the 'best-practice' development of an ethics program, but by supplementing this with the real actions of firms, the book joins a select few books on business ethics that is actually useful to those of us in the business world. An invaluable day-to-day aid."
4,Lotus Guide Magazine Review,"The New Children and Near-Death ExperiencesBy P.M.H. Atwater(ISBN 1-59143-020-8)Not only is this a glimpse into the inner world of a child who's had a near-death experience (NDE), it's part of an ever-growing mountain of evidence that we, as a human race, are fast approaching a quantum leap in our evolution. P.M.H. Atwater started her research into NDEs in 1978, one year after having three NDEs herself. She presents compelling data that suggest children who return from a near-death experience are not the same children they were before. As you read through case studies, you find yourself left with new insights about what death is and, for that matter, what life is. Since these are children you get the sense that their accounts of their experiences were uncontaminated by beliefs, concepts, and ideologies that are learned through life experiences as adults.Rahasya Poe, Lotus GuideTo Believe Or Not To Believe: The Social and Neurological Consequences of Belief Systems"
2,children and NDE's,"i don't know what i expected, but it wasn't to be bored to death. maybe to be inspired, or to learn something i didn't know. it was far to clinical for inspiration. it reminded me of a college textbook, and it was just as tedious as one. it is definitly not a book to keep next to the commode. yes, i learned some things, and that's why i gave it 2 stars. the book wasn't bad, it was just not what i expected, or wanted."
4,A must own for Sabbath & hard rock fans.,"This album, along with ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" are the best offerings from this legendary band. There isn't a dull moment on this disc. They were exploring new grounds at the time, and came up with a winner. Eveybody wins here, the band, the record company, and especially the fans. Black Sabbath is the best hard rock band of all time, and great albums like this one and ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"" are the proof."
4,"THIS BAND WAS AMAZING, OUT OF THIS WORLD","Here are my prefered Sabbath ( with Ozzy ) albuns:1) SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH 2) SABOTAGE 3) PARANOID 4) VOLUME FOUR 5) BLACK SABBATH 6) MASTER OF REALITY 7) NEVER SAY DIE 8) TECHNICAL ECSTASYSo, I can say there's no flaw at all iN SABOTAGE. The album is perfect, heavy but with musical differences between the songs. Ozzy is singing like never. A true gem."
5,At their best ever !!,"I am still waiting for a double cd release of this album. To me, simply their very best ever ! Sabotage is very well produced and performed. It contains some of the heaviest songs ever put on tape by the band !!"
5,The Most Underrated Album Ever,"Not just for Black Sabbath, but for any band. This is probably the best album by Sabbath, and many say it is the worst. This 1975 album showcases a much heavier edge than Black sabbath was used to. It's like the usual sound, wxed with almost thrash metal sounding melodies. Well, maybe not that fast, but real fast. This album shows how Black sabbath is still one of the heaviest bands out there. Pantera covered Hole In The Sky on Reinventing the Steel, and it sounds almost exactly the same. Megalomania, clocking in at almost ten minutes is probably the best song on the album, beginning with sludgy, doomy, weeping sounds, then going into crunching rock melodies. This is definitely the most underrated album. Ignore what most people say about this album, it is all wrong. This is far better than Paranoid."
4,Not quite as good as Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,"This album gets off to a ridiculous start: the cover is one of the silliest I've seen, and at least two band members are wearing embarrassingly naff gear.But the music inside is great. For me the highlight is 'Thrill of it all'. The music sounds so contemporary, and yet -- and this will put off all of today's teenagers -- it contains next to no offensive language.Iommi is an excellent guitarist here. Who was best: Iommi, Page or Blackmore? You can see that the three were playing to broadly similar audiences. Both Iommi and Page wrote for acoustic guitar, too. But whereas Page's acoustic is a vital facet of the Zeppelin canon, Iommi's seems dispensable. Sabbath without the acoustic was still Sabbath; Sabbath without the heavy electric guitar would be commercial suicide. (Has there been a Sabbath Unplugged?)If you only buy one Sabbath album, get 'Bloody Sabbath'. But this comes a reasonably close second."
5,Sabbath's Best,"This is simply Sabbath's best. All the songs on this are great even the short acoustic don't start (too late) and the haunting supertzar. Evreyone who even has a slight interest in heavy metal should get this if just for Symptom of the Universe which contains one of the best (and often immitated) guiter riff that is certainly the blueprint for all heavy metal bands to come this song is defintly one of the sabs best and is a absolute classic. But IMO the best song on this album is the last track the 8 min magnum opus ""The Writ""what a perfect way to end a perfeect album. Sabotage also contains to other sab classics Hole in the sky and the 9 1/2 min Megalomania. I still cant understand why this album didn't do that good when it was first released. BUY IT NOW!"
3,HELLO?,"This is the last decent Sabbath album with Ozzy but not as good as any of those preceding it.you can already hear their bordome in the music. The beginning of the end for this line-up.THE ALBUMS TO GET ARE THE FIRST FIVE, ""BLACK SABBATH"" THROUGH ""SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH"" and if you're not an Ozzy purist,THE TWO DIO ALBUMS."
1,NOT such a good album:(,"I saw Black Sabbath live, during the early eightees!!! We LOVE the eightees, NOT the seventees:( They look like hippies on the cover:( We hate hippies:( Look at that hippy dress Ozzy is wearing!!! And those hooker boots!!!;) They looked better with Ronnie James Dio when I saw them live;) They opened for Bananarama, Spandau Ballet and The Thomson Twins!!! We LOVE the eightees:) NOT the seventees:( We hate hippies:("
1,They sabotaged themselves with this one,"Black Sabbath / Sabotage: apart from a single decent track, this album is wretched. This band once had guts and imagination. Now they are a full blown parody of themselves. The band should have posed for their picture wearing rubber ball noses and big floppy shoes. One Star"
5,Their peak,"Great song-writing, good compositiion (if at times pompous- but hey, that's the point of hard rock/heavy metal). Angst oozes from the tracks and the lyrics are thought provoking (but don't spend too much time mulling it over)."
5,Creative Peak,"Sabotage, without question, is Sabbaths finest moment. This knocks all previous albums (and that includes SBS and Paranoid) for six. Infact even Zeppelin couldn't match the grandiose, gargantuan Heaven sent sound of this album. It may take you a few listens to fully appreciate, but when you do you'll realise this IS the defining moment of 70's Classic Rock. I cant get enough of Meglomania, The Writ and The Thrill of it all, and once you get this, nor will you."
5,Classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Other than ""Paranoid"",which is my fave Sabbath, ""Sabotage"" is way up there,among faves from Sabbath w/ Ozzy.The album is strong from top to bottom.My standouts are,""Hole In The Sky"",""Symptom of The Universe"",""Megalomania"",""The Thrill of It All"" and ""The Writ"",which is one of my fave tunes,behind ""The Wizard"". Ozz rules and will always be my fave lead singer of Sabbath,although a big fan of Dio too.But that is another subject.Go get it!!!!"
5,There Must Be a Hole in the Sky...!!!,"This album is quite different from other Sabbath albums but it is still great metal and a classic! It is so aggressive and brutal - it really works! Ozzy's voice is so aggressive that you should beware...!!! Black Sabbath did 6 classics during Ozzy's area - and this is one of them. The songs like ""Hole in the Sky"" and ""Symptom of the Universe"" are their live classics, and ""Megalomania"", a 10-minute long is definitely not a boring song at all. I really love this album because it is not as doomy as the earlier Sabbath albums.Stars: The Writ, Hole in the Sky, Symptom of the Universe"
5,BLACK SABBATH LIVE FROM PANDEMONIUM !!!,"L'Album de Black Sabbath que vous devez posséder (wharf !) absolument si vous tes fan de Blue Öyster Cult. Superbe d'un bout à l'autre et faites gaffe à ne pas retrouver avec l'ersatz sur lequel figure un titre live en plus. Non seulement, ce dernier gche tout, mais encore vous prive-t-il du chant a capella qui figure sur l'album vinyle original et qui vaut son pesant d'ail !!! Ré-écoutez les riffs -qui n'ont jamais été aussi lumineux- de Tommy Iommi, entendez-les décrire comment vous essayez de vous désengluer de la mare au Diable dans laquelle vous vous tes invités bien seul(e)(s). Vous tes bon(ne)(s) pour les sables mouvants et c'est si bon. Un album jouissif !!!"
4,Solid Sabbath,"What else can be said?Black Sabbath released Sabotage in 1975. Though this album, in my opinion, isn't their best, it is nevertheless a very solid Sabbath album from the Ozzy era. Ozzy, Geezer, Tony, and Bill are pretty much in top form. Black Sabbath is known for their catchy hard rock guitar riffs, and this album provides many. Songs such as ""Megalomania"", ""The Thrill Of It All"", and ""Supertzar"" are good examples. These three songs also happen to be favorites on the album.This album is a must-own for all true Black Sabbath fans."
4,The beginning of the end . . . almost.,"By most accounts, Black Sabbath's stride began to waver a bit with the release of Sabotage. In strictly relative terms that may be true. Any band is bound to peak sooner or later, and Sabotage is clearly the day after. No new ground is broken and the performances occasionally lack Sabbath's typically tight delivery. Nonetheless, Sabotage stands quite nicely on its own merits and offers enough to keep any fan happy. On no other album will you find Bill Ward working as hard as he does pounding out Symptom of the Universe. Megalomania is an unheralded classic, displaying great production and quintessential Sabbath song construction. The rest of the album includes similar efforts except Supertzar which is just weird and ends, thankfully, before it ever really begins. For the most part Black Sabbath are guilty only of resting on their laurels, but, given their credentials at this point, zero growth isn't necessarily a bad thing."
5,"Actually, this is my favorite Sabbath album","If I had to pick a single favorite Sabbath album, this would be it. Of course Paranoid set the bar for heavy metal, but I think this album was a bit more mature. Some of Paranoid's lyrics were a little clumsy. With Sabotage, Iomi, Osborne, Butker, and Ward a little more mature, and it shows. Of course every track still rocks like a mother-f#&$%@!"
4,Photo lab quality at home,"This cp-220 printer was easy to set up and print photo lab quality pictures right on my kitchen table, without my computer. Only one concern: I wish that the 4x6 paper did not have the post card lines/address/stamp on the back."
1,Printer NOT compatible with windows 7,"I bought this printer after reading the good reviews. I was excited to use it, and spent two frustrating hours trying to get it set up on my computer. I finally contacted CANON support. They informed me that this printer does not have a driver for WINDOWS 7. THey gave me suggestions for using the printer, by transferring photos to a card, then to a card reader, then to the printer. NOT worth that much work! If you don't have a Canon or PicBridge camera, Don't buy this printer!"
4,This is an excellent book for every woman to read.,Beth Moran really lets you into her soul and explains how to get in touch with your body and with what is really going on in your life. She lets you see how emotions effect your body and how you are holding on to past hurts.
4,Great item,This hose warmer worked very well. Our only issue with it was hanging it close enough to the hose bib to keep most of the hose warm...
4,K&H All Season Hose Heater from Amazon,"The K&H Hose Heater works great. I am using it in a horse barn and it is a life saver. Last year we had to disconnect the hose all winter and carry the water in buckets, now we can use the hose and never have to worry about freezing. The zipper could be improved, it does not seem too heavy duty and the tap to pull it up already broke. We had to fasten a wire so we could use it."
1,whimpy squaring arm,"the 450 is good. however, the 5 1/2"" squaring arm is totally inadequate. further, for narrow cuts you may only get 1"" worth of squaring arm. therefore i would rate the 450 as a poor machine. logan must have had the same view because they discontinued the 450 and replaced it with the 450-1. the 450-1 has a nice calibrated squaring arm. i wish i had known that i was purchasing d/c'd item at the time. if logan was responsive to there product users needs they would see fit to make a suitable calibrated squaring arm for sale to 450 owners which could be adapted to that machine."
2,Beautiful,"I absolutely loved this bracelet. Unfortunately, while at the Celtic Festival in Belfast, I lost it. It was exquiste and just what I wanted. Not to worry, however, as with Amazon I can certaily order it again!Thank you so much for such a beautiful piece at such an affordable price."
3,Feel The Need,"You can't hear this here, but i find, the track ""Feel The Need"" is the best track on this CD. Beacause it's a melodious, mid-tempo evergreen. But i find, the followed CD (Ain't No Doubt...) and the first CD (Graham Central Station) was more funkier."
5,IT a good look bait And it work good,All fish bait do not cauth fish but work the bait right and it will work try all of my bait let it work for you
3,"easy to use, but.....","I have a love/hate relationship with this product. It is easy to use and does what it's supposed to. My only complaint is that the sound quality is horrible - even after messing with the vloume levels on my phone. The sound quality alone is enough to make this product unworthy of being purchased. Do yourself a favor and test it out with the free trial (offered on their website) before purchasing. The sound quality may or may not annoy you as much as it does me.Update: You can go to the official website and download an upgrade that has a volume normalizer - it makes a big difference in the sound quality, though it is still slightly annoying."
4,"Hey it works, what more can you ask??","Hey, this worked. I have never used another type, so I can't compare, but it worked and was easy to use! YAY!"
2,bad sound,this program is easy to use but the sound is terrible when it gets to your phone I would not recommend.
2,Beware. No Internet No Workie,"My issue is that the CD I got was verion 3.5. Which would launch but would only work in Demo mode becuase I was not connected to the internet to register my code. I bought this program for my son's PC that has no internet. So i connected to the internet and registered version 3.5. I then upgraded to the newest version 4.5.3 with no problems. The newest version has many new features the version 3.5 claims to have. When I removed the PC from the internet DJ ToneXpress version 4.5.3 stopped working. It would try to connect to the online services and fail and not launch. SO BEWARE, NO INTERNET NO WORKIE."
1,Watch OUT,"Purchase AT YOUR OWN RISK! The quality of the ringtones generated was poor. Unless you have web access on your phone and pay for the service, it's difficult to get the ringtone to the phone (even though they include a link to download the tone to your computer for transfer, my phone didn't see the transferred file as a ringtone until I msg'd it to myself). The link to send the ringtone download link to the phone didn't work. Poor customer service - NO REFUND, so be sure you want ro risk the purchase price before you spend your money. Their reason for not refunding is that the software prompts you to create a test ringtone to send to your phone before purchase. Problem is that no matter what sound file you use to create the test ringtone, it generates a generic ringtone which is in no way resultant from your source file. In my mind that is not a valid test.I would not recommend this product. I will buy my ringtones instead. At least I will get something for my money."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This program is good, UNTIL you get the ringtone on your phone, and it sounds worse than an AM Radio station. Don't waste your money on this thing, just pay for the decent sounding ringtones."
1,STOPPED WORKING,Do not buy this software. The software stopped working when I updated to 4.7.5. The response from support was to re-install the program. That did not work & now I get no response from support. I cannot recommend this software because it can stop working at anytime with no recourse and no support from website or company.
1,Won't work with IPhone,"I bought this thinking it would allow me to make ringtones for my iPhone. Based on the description, I thought this would work. What I received is an old version of the software (v 3.5) and it isn't compatable with iPhones. Fortunately it was only $10, but still a waste of money for what I thought I was buying."
4,Not fancy but works well,"This is not the fanciest ringtone software out there but compared to others that have more bells and whistles I get no error messages, it works quickly and is easy to set up. Some of the others have more creative graphics but I wouldn't pay more for them. The best feature is the zoom and tuning to 1/100th of a second. Rating - 3.5/5 for functionality; 5/5 for price; overall 4/5."
3,Need no life to play,"Everquest is a valiant attempt at an online rpg hypbrid but is far too encompassing for its own good. One must have no life and play constantly to really get the most out of the game and advance. I like the characters and idea but i just cannot get into it, i am looking forward to similar games with what i feel will be better online capabilities and better enjoyment and value. I would recommend Capcom's Monster Hunter or even the obligatory FF but that one has monthly fees whereas Monster Hunter is free."
4,Not bad at all.,"If you'd like to start playing Everquest but have never touched it before, this is a good title to start with.The graphics are top notch, there's enough servers (worlds) to explore and monsters to kill.The one small problem I found with the game (That should *NOT* deter you from checking out this title) is the lack of abilities at the lower levels. Here, you are expected to follow a linear path of doing tasks for trainers. I'd rather be out killing monsters, but in order for you to get to this stage, you have a few hours of boring tasks to do.Other than that, it was well worth the purchase and I can't go a few days without playing."
3,Good enough set,"I really like to organizer box. Came with plenty of batteries, some odd sizes that I hope will not go out on date anytime soon and too few of the two most common types that I have had to re supply. THe tool itself is not of that great quality. Good enough for changing batteries now and them, but not much more. The pin remover broke on the first use. Would probably have invested a little more in the tool kit itself to get better quality. But a good enough deal because of the batteries."
2,Watch Battery/Tool Kit,The instructions are very basic - they reference tools and items that aren't available with the kit. There is no description of the tools included and the battery tester has no information with it.The quality of the vise is pretty poor - the watches I had wouldn't fit in the vise.
1,Spirit voices,"I found this group because of the beautiful song ""You are the new day"". I'm dissappointed that the rest of the cuts I've heard - while technically sound - lack even an ounce of soul. It seems clear to me that they should stick to classical arrangements and immediately abandon covering pop tunes. That or be arrested for terminal lack of hipness."
5,Perfect for exploring one's relationship with the Lord!,This book is wonderful reading. Juanita Bynum has the ability to make you understand that she is a woman just like the rest of us out here that are trying to be the virtous woman that the Lord would have us to be. The book will lead you to examine your walk with Christ and your walk with the people that are in your life. KUDOS!Juanita's testimony is a true blessing.
4,My computer can now cook omlettes while I play!,"Amazing video card, I am howver having to upgrade my system cooling. This card runs (Idle) at 75c and under load at well over 80c. It maintains stability, but is so hot! I would still recomend this card to anyone that wants great graffics at a low price. (The money you save will be spent on cool LED Fans, and mesh windows to lower your ambient temperature) Lol."
4,Amazing 8800GTS card,This purchased product is really good. This video card has the latest technology with 320 MB of memory. Its price and features are suitable for normal users.
4,"Fast, Quiet, and Cheap","This card will run pretty much any current game at max settings with a reasonable resolution. It's quiet, reasonably cool, and this is the sweet spot in terms of price/performance. Half the price of the GTX for 80% of the performance (I'm estimating based on what I've read)."
4,"""Exodus""--3 stars; ""Throne""--4 stars","""Farscape"" has developed into one of the best shows on television. Enjoyment of these early episodes is enhanced by the addition of deleted material and lively commentary. ""Escape from Exodus"" is an enjoyable story, but far from ""Farscape"" at its best. The tale of an infestation by space parasites is enlivened by entertaining character interaction, always one of this show's strengths. ""Throne for a Loss,"" on the other hand, is terrific. Rygel, as despicably hilarious as ever, is kidnapped by the Tavleks, a race of warriors who rely on an addictive drug, administered through ""power gauntlets,"" to heighten their power and aggression. To save Rygel, Aeryn, Crichton, and D'Argo all take their turns with the weapon, and the way in which it affects each of them provides interesting and amusing insights into their characters. The way in which Crichton resolves the conflict is perfect."
1,smashed cups,"Of the four cups received, one was smashed as if hit with hammer; two had their handles broken off. Who knows, maybe someone was practicing their drop kick. I read the one review about the badly packed cups. I thought that that may have been the odd experience. It wasn't. I believe its the typical experience. Either amazon does a poor job of packaging or their supplier doesn't care to package their product for a safe return. Incompetence! I would never never ever buy a product from this Company. I've been buying from amazon for years. This is the first time I've written a review of any kind. Maybe this will stop someone else from buying this product."
3,Cute but breakable,I really loved this pendant when I got it. Problem is that only lasted for about a week before one of the arms broke off. I only wore this when I was going out and wasn't ruff on it at all. I don't feel like there was any reason for it to have broke so quickly.
3,Very Small Snowflake Pendant,"This item is very small. I am not pleased. The size on the picture is deceptive. I thought it would be true to size, but it isn't."
4,"Good explanation of ""where it all came from""","Hecht does a good job of explaining where the technology of fiber optics communications came from. His book is not an explanation of how fiber optics communications works, but a history. I have a reasonably good background in fiber optics communications so it's difficult for me to judge whether someone who knew nothing about it would find it easy to follow, although I think they would.I would particularly recommend the book to fiber optic techies - it really makes the technology more meaningful when you understand how the technology developed. A fine job by a good writer - very close to five stars.And if you're technically oriented and want more knowledge of fiber optic technology, I'd recommend ""Optical Networks"" by Ramaswami and Sivarajan."
5,"Great Section on Nobel Prize Winner, Charles K. Kao!","Charles Kao recently won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics ""for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibers for optical communication."" Hecht does a terrific job giving a thorough description of Kao's work that won him this award."
4,Fascinating,"This book is one of the most fascinating things I have ever read. The descriptions of the MGM auction and the details of the days leading up to it are priceless. As another reviewer has stated, I also think this book should be expanded/updated and re-released.... possibly as a hardcover coffee table book. Since it was written, Debbie Reynolds has publicly shown her Arabian test shoes and has admitted her dealings with Kent Warner. Also, at least one pair of slippers has changed hands again and one pair has been stolen."
2,Handle is Very Short,"I returned this product the moment I saw it because the handle was so small. Because I never opened and tried the brush, I can't tell you if it works well or not. I just don't like how small the handle is. It would not be a comfortable brush to hold for any lenght of time so I returned it."
1,Good Video/Bad Ending,Shame that the 2002 Fiesta Bowl had to be marred by contraversial call by game official Terry Porter.
2,Get a better frame.,Picture contrast is too high. Pictures look washed out. There are no image settings other than brightness control. There has to be better frames than this available.
4,RPG action game has finally been born!,This game is great i have looked at forty screen shots before i baught this game and let me tell you is is worth buying. I you liked diablo 2 then this is just like it only with better grafics!
1,backgrounds and music anyone?,"Okay, my best friend and I rented this game because it seemed really cool. Then we put it in the PS2 and waited for about 10-15 minutes for it to load. Seriously! Then we built our characters (the coolest part) and went to play.The beginning wasn't bad. Pretty standard leveling up crap. The sound, however, never worked properly. The music came and went. The cut scenes constantly froze. The backgrounds would take about 15 minutes just to load and then when we left one area we had to wait another 15 minutes for that background to load. We tried 3 different games all with the same results. Also, the PS2 plays every other game perfectly, so I think this is a big problem with the game.Try something else because this game isn't worth it."
1,the #!%$ing game will not work!,Ok so i just got the game like 10 minutes and when i put the game in the playstation2 it it read the disc for about a minute and then said disc read error did anyone else have this problem?
1,Get real,This game is nowhere close to what I expected. I was tired of playing it the frist day. Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance 2 is 10x more fun!
4,Explore the Worlds of Norath,"I found this game a bit too easy but there are times when the difficulty rating was high and it was certainly more challenging. The Prince of Hate can only be defeated a certain way regardless of what difficulty level you play. Once you figure out how to beat him and the other bosses you pretty much got the game cornered. I liked the character customization at the very beginning. You'll also notice that all the NPC's you encounter that are female have very noticable endowments to say the least. The game is prone to crashing if there's but one small scratch on the disc or if your PS2 isn't at least a year old. Yeah that bites and this is the only reason I don't give this otherwise enjoyable game more than 4 stars. The bugs will annoy you after awhile. I am fortunate enough to have ordered a game that's bug free, but I've heard other folks complain mostly about the bugs in this game. Well, I suggest renting first."
5,Awesome,"This game has many adventures. The characters are not weak. Opponents are ok. Bosses are the funniest. they can be very challenging and on two players, we watch each other scream like little girls when the boss kills us(it is funny.). It is a awesome game."
2,it doesent work,I bought this thinking the minute i get it play for 2 hours. i got to play it for 2 minutes before it froze. and the 2 minutes were boring.
3,"Great game, with what appear to be some glitches.","It is a great game, almost exactly like Baldur's Gate for those who are looking for similar games. The disk itself appears to require alot of space on the memory card, but even when I deleted enough, it still only let us save the game once because there wasn't enough room. One other problem was that several times the Loading menu got stuck and we were looking at it for 5 minuetes before we decided we should reboot the game.So those were the problems, but I had a lot of fun playing it, so it was worth it I think."
4,Good RPG game,"Good game, if you like the type. Even though this is like the countless amount of hack and slash RPG games out there this is still good. This game has typical graphics but great music and sound effects. Definately worth checking out, you'll spend quite a few hours playing this."
4,Almost as good as LOTR games!,"This is a great game! The graphics are good, and so is the gameplay. This games would have gotten 5 stars if the camera veiw was better but you get used the the camers veiw. If you liked the Baldurs Gate games then you will love this game! If you are a gamer that isn't very good then buy the strategy guide for this game! When you buy this game make sure that you have a big tv! With a small tv you will die easier because you can't see as well."
2,this game was better when it was called baldur's gate: dark alliance,"ok so i knew it was like baldur's gate, but unfortunately it's worse! it gives you too many options to deal with items, customizations and whatnot, and not enough fun action. i was really hoping a big problem with baldur's gate (aiming arrows) would be fixed, but nope! it wasn't. in fact, the problem was worse. screw this game."
2,didn't live up to the hype,"i was expecting this game to be really good, along the lines of baldur's gate, and it started out that way. but then i kept playing. i was a cleric, and i think i had about four different weapons the entire game. i racked up over 500,000 gold because i had barely anything to spend it on. it's a good hack and slash, but the only driving force is getting to the next level. there's no saving up to buy new stuff because there's nothing good to buy, and hardly anything i could even use. same goes for the spells, which were practically useless. played it once through, but not going to again"
4,Fun to Play,"Very similar to Bauldrs Gate 1 and 2. In this one you can modify your character and you have the option to play 4 players unlike the Baulders Gate's. Otherwise very similar, but easier than Baulders Gate 2."
5,"Oh man, wanna play Champions?","This game is the tops. Best multiplayer RPG for this system!! I spent hours with friends, family, and usually alone time playing this awesome game. Pretty good graphics for the time period, decent storyline, that really is optional to follow (the game is really straight-forward), and I am proud to say that I was able to sway many of my girls that are friends to spend the afternoon crawling through the dungeons.It's easy to get into, super addictive, and pretty awesome character design. I had a bit of a rough time when it came to solely spell-caster class, but as long as you're familiar with the hotkey, you should be absolutely fine."
4,Best game i have ever played,I was told by a friend that this game was good. He lied it is an amazing game and i would recommend this game to anyone that likes hack and slash style games. From beginning to end this is one of the best games i have played. I usually don't give good reviews for games but there is no way that this game should deserve a bad reputation. This game you don't just get new weapons but you get to change armor by picking it up randomly throughout the game. And the game couldn't have come in any better condition than this. It was just like any game you buy brand new except it actually worked (jk). If you want a game that doesn't cost much and has plenty of replay value then buy this game and start playing.
5,awesome game!,this game is awesome! I've been looking for this game everywhare and its never around so when I saw it here I bought it as soon as I could.if you like dark alliance and games like it you will love this game.
3,If I'm not mistaken...False Advertisement?,"I received the book, and it is in good condition, but there is no CD(s) with it. I had a hard enough time finding the workbook on its own. I feel the CDs, which follow parts of the workbook, would have been very helpful. This is my education, my future, and I would have liked to know before I made the purchase that something was missing.Here it mentions the CD, I thought it was mentioned in my description. Please let me know if the CD was suppose to be included.Thank You"
2,not what was pictured,"This product is much, much, much darker than pictured. In fact, I'd say it is almost black. Also, it is much larger than pictured. I purchased the 18 to 24 months hoping that my long legged daughter would fit in it- it is way too big on her! She has out-grown almost all her 18 to 24 month clothing, this one hangs past her knees and falls off her shoulders-I'd guess the more accurae size is 3T. It looks to be of durable quality. I can only hope it washes up well."
2,Not Charo's most entrancing,"I was extremely disappointed with this production. Being an owner of Guitar Passion which I play in my car and on my MP3 player almost daily, I purchased this one ""sight unseen"" (without listeming to a single demo from it. I was expecting to hear her playing ""solo"" (at which she excels) and also listen to her singing a few tunes (which her smoky voice and Castillan --i.e., real Spanis-- render into magic, her guitar playing in this CD was almost somethered by the rest of the instruments. I could spemd hours listening to her Flamenco (or even modern) solos, but not this one. I spend more hours on YouTube listening to her than to this CD."
5,Chiro the Great,"This lady is a true artist her guitar music gives me goose bumps. I cant just listen one time, 2 or 3 times is a must."
4,A few new songs and some previous favorites,"Aside from a couple of songs that have appeared on previous releases, this new instrumental release includes studio recorded songs that Charo performs in her show. The recording of Bolero is very similar to the live version and is beautifully done on the CD. Even the techno version of Bolero is surprisingly good! The other tracks don't stray far from the Guitar work that appeared on her previous release, Guitar Passion"". Anyone that enjoys her live shows will love this CD. Charo continues to amaze people with her talents as a classical guitarist. She's truly gifted!"
4,Worth the price for the entertainment value alone,"We've had this toy for several months now and honestly I'm surprised that it's survived as long as it has. My dogs are pretty hard on toys and tend to destroy stuffed ones, this toy is still in one piece which is pretty impressive. The best part is the barking though, my dogs are so entertained and occasionally confused by the barking toy, which is in turn, incredibly entertaining for anyone watching, this type of toy is well worth the price just to watch your dog play with it. The only reason why i didn't give it a perfect 5 is that the toy gets dingy looking pretty quickly and with the electronics inside it's not the easiest thing in the world to clean since I can't just toss it in the washing machine."
4,Very cute,My dog loves this toy. He sleeps with it and loves to make it talk. Material could be a little stronger because I can see it won't be long and I will have to replace because his chewing rips it up.
3,cute but...,"Cute toy, liked it because it looks just like my little 15 lb. King Charles Spaniel. She LOVED it but had the nose ripped off and the stuffing pulled out within an hour of giving it to her. Hope I can sew it up again but if not will have to throw it away which will be a big waste of money."
1,not for puppies,I was surprised that this toy is suppose to be for dogs. My puppy which is a small dog had the nose torn off and was taking the stuffing out by the second day. So unfornatley I had to throw it out. It was a cute toy and had the same colors of my doggie.
5,My dog loves this so much...,She has buried it someplace for safekeeping and now the ground is covered with snow. I will have to buy another.
4,Great toy for your Pet,"My little dog just opened his gift this Christmas morning. He went nuts over this barking little dog toy, carried it around and chewed on its nose. It's like his little baby now. It's a good toy for dogs who like to chew on plush because the material is strong. Some chew toys would lose ""fur"" after some abuse but this one looks like will last for some time."
2,Not tough enough,"The toy is cute and my Yorkie definitely loved it, but he destroyed it within 15 minutes. All it took was 15 minutes for my 4lb Yorkie to rip a whole in the side of the dogs head. I took it away and sowed it back up and gave to him again the next day. He tore a new hole on the other side of the head. Sowed it up again and gave it back to him again. A few minutes later he tore an ear off. After that I figured it was a losing battle and put the toy in the trash. It was a cool toy the small period of time that it did last."
5,Best Dog Toy Ever!,My poochon and maltipoo love love love this toy! This is the first stuffed toy they haven't destroyed and I think it's cause it does NOT squeak. They love squeaky toys but they also love to chew them up and get the squeaker out. With this toy they love to hear the panting and barking and they don't chew it. Go figure! They just play with it so that it makes the dog noises and they will carry it around and sometimes put it in their bed to sleep with it. I am so happy I bought this toy - it definitely was well worth the money and I recommend it to other owners whole heartedly!
5,puppy toy,Our 12 year old Golden has loved talking toys since she was a pup. They only get replaced because she wears them out - but it does take a long time to do that.
3,Unconventional Success,Its probly due to my ability to understand but it was not real clear. I found it to acadamic and not down to the level of the average engineer/inverstor/self retirement manager. I was looking for more guidance to long term investing for the average home porfolio.
4,A Must Read for Personal Investors,"Excellent insight into the pitfalls of wall street and mutual funds. This is a must read for any personal investor. Very valuable information on how to select mutual funds and ETFs without having to pay a fortune either in annual expenses, taxes due to high turnover and underperformance of the fund."
2,Poorly Written,"While I have a lot of admiration for Swensen and his accomplishments, he has difficulty writing in plain english. Unlike his earlier book, supposedly he wrote this book for the masses and not just portfolio managers. Unfortunately, the book is just simply loaded down with unnecessary portfolio/finance babble, which makes this book difficult to read and dense as wood. It is too bad, because Swensen puts forth a number of important points in his book, but their effect is diminished by the author's poor writing."
5,Unconventional Success,"Good for a general background for a person entering the investment area to save for their retirement. Has a somewhat critical review of Mutual Funds which, in my experience, is an honest review of the excessive fees related to the Mutual Fund investment."
2,Excellent Ideas but I couldn't finish it,"Well, the title says it all. Where was the editor on this? The first rule of writing is always to keep your reader's interest. I think major points of the book could be made less often to reduce repetitiveness. And less written on points that are kind of obvious - like ""Taxes impair wealth accumulation."" I tried reading just the summaries, but the book is more than just that. I got it out of the library, but I ran out of renewals.Even so, the ideas are VERY important to consider, so everyone should make an attempt at it."
3,Ugh - Another great investor tells us we can't do what he did,"There is a ton of good info in the book but little in the way of specific actionable advice...You will find buried references to certain managers and funds but you will work to find it. More depressing is the revelation that you (as the individual investor) must settle for average and not even try to duplicate the author's own success. Sorry, just stick to average, that's the best you can do (unless you get lucky and find a really good fund manager)."
2,Difficult To Read,"Swensen may be a brilliant investor--but he's not much of a writer. The book is extremely dense and often painful to read. If you are unfamiliar with the industry lingo, you'll find it especially difficult."
2,Historical not current,"I was looking for more current advise on investing. This turns out to be a historical analysis of the period 1980 to 2004. It is an excellent discription of mutual fund abuses in that period, but not very useful for todays investor looking forward."
4,Unconventional Success: A Fundamental Approach to Investing,"Swensen's text is well developed and demonstrates a reasonable and rational approach to investing. Though not a text for the novice, I found it accessible to the average reader, as I gained familiarity with the language of investing, and intend to follow his advice."
3,OK but expected much more from this author,"As background, I have just retired. I was looking for an academic review of currentinvestment methods and their pros and cons. This book provided some useful information but much, too much space on how dastardly the financial industry is. Little on the way of providing the background or research on any of his portfolio recommendations or their basis. This ""just trust me"" attitude is the same attitude the author claims the Financial industry takes. I was disappointed for someone of the author's stature. My recommendation would be to look elsewhere for help."
2,Wants to be 2 books,"This book wants to be at least two different books:1) A book slamming the mutual fund industry2) A book giving new investors basic descriptions of different asset classes and the behavior to expect from them.On the first point, I don't know why he bothered. Anyone who has done any research on mutual funds and how they have been run in recent years will already know all of this. The only addition was the information on some of the newest ETFs and how they aren't so great. This is worthless repetition of common information.On the second point, it would be OK for some new investors, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.In the end his strongest point seems to be that the investment world is strongly against the small individual investor. Great, thanks a lot. Why not use all of your years of experience to give us some help? Telling us the most available options are worthless and then not giving us anywhere to go isn't useful."
1,Feeble Attempt,"Many have tried to repackage the bible of fundamental analysis, Graham and Dodd. This is merely a generic version of the same in pablum form to attract the gullible investing public. I have studied others such as Samuelson, Friedman, etc and these are the acknowledged and accepted standard bearers of analysis. Now for the author to attempt to attack the well documented success of Fidelity Management's Lynch, Vinick, and Legg Mason's Miller who have recorded uninterrupted consecutive annual profitable investment returns and to recommend indexing is a joke and erely an attempot to prey upon the public."
5,a marvelous compilation of reminiscences,"This book, originally compiled during the early postwar years at Los Alamos, consists of reminiscences, letters, and essays by representative women who devoted their lives to the Los Alamos experience during World War II. A unique description of the Manhattan Project, it remains one of those disarming pieces of historical literature that make history such an engrossing field to wander into."
4,A feel good book of humorous church signs,"The authors compiled a list of church signs they have seen while on the road. 134 pages of one, two or three clever eye-catching signs per page. It started with the title, on an empty church in North Carolina. Then they kept a notebook with them as they traveled and recorded these ""snetence sermons"" as they call them, adfter their epiphany in North Carolina. One of the catchiest, ""When you meet tempation, turn to the light.""This is an easy read and a very enjoyable one."
4,witty,This is a good reference book to use when you are trying to say something catchy on your church sign. Recommend.
1,stupid game(Syphon Filter),"i brought a game few day later ( syphon Filter) its really stupid, in the game there's no saving point and saving mode which i can access. tell me how ?? to save my game during playing?"
4,Interesting and up-to-date,This book is an excellent resource for anyone who needs up-to-date information on polar bears. It is divided into short chapters that deal with all aspects of this topic - from physiology to interaction with humans. An index is provided which greatly facilitates the retrieval of information. The superb illustrations also add to the overall appeal of this title.
3,Size does not show in description,"According to sellers website:""Item # 83955 - Extra wide sock band limits pressure on calves. Sensura fabric is colorfast, fast drying, breathable and resists shrinkage. Sensura polyester/nylon/Lycra. Sold as single pair. Fit shoe sizes 13-17. Machine wash. Imported."""
4,Review: Travels with My Paintbox,"I've met Tom Hill personally on several occasions (back in the 70's in Tucson). I've always known he loved Mexico, and purchased one of his Oaxaca night scenes from Priscilla Peirce at the Print Room gallery. One of my daughters has it now on her wall. Until reading this book, however, I hadn't realized Tom had traveled as much as he has. Service, delivery and condition in buying this book - excellent.Evert Furrey"
3,Not very comfortable,"I wish I could have returned these, but I was dumb and threw everything out once I got the shoe. I assumed because the brand was Kenneth Cole that the she would be comfortable, but it is not. The shoe was so inexpensive because it is a cheap shoe. It feels like the heel is digging into your heel, and the edges of the material--the top of the shoe, where it is open--really scratches my feet. I do not like this shoe and will try to sell it to a resale shop. If your feet can handle uncomfortable shoes, then this might be ok, but if you prefer to be able to wear your shoes for more than three minutes before ailments begin, this is not the shoe for you."
2,Sizing Off,"I have multiple pairs of Kenneth Cole Reaction shoes, all in size 8.5, so that's what I ordered. These are a size too big on me. Very disappointing.Adorable shoe and looks like it'd be comfortable, but can't walk in them to find out."
1,should have listened to reviews..,"But no, I went right ahead and purchased these shoes. They are like a size bigger, and the comment about heel digging into my heel is very true. I feel sad whenever I look at these shoes because I worn them only once and not sure what to do with them since I cant wear them anymore. I am such a huge fan of KC, own lots of his shoes and always convince people to buy KC's shoes, but these ones are a huge dissapointment."
2,Over priced but in good condition,"Has last owners name on it, Speedy shipping. slightly over priced. The game its self is not as fun as i remember it being when I was a child."
2,"How could anyone like this game, it sucks","The Devil must have made this game. It is so incredibly hard that it isn't even fun. I really hate this game. If you are reading this and not sure If you want to buy this game, I would say buy something better like an arbys roast beef sandwich. Eating that will be ten times the fun you will have trying to enjoy this game and after five minutes putting it on your shelf next to Bart vs. the space mutants, which is the stupidest piece of crap ever made."
3,"Good historical fiction, restrained romance","As a person who happens to enjoy civil war history, I found the historical perspectives really interesting. I thought that the main characters showed the emotional restraints appropriate to the times. But it was not a book I wanted to cuddle up and read. The constant discussion of sawing off limbs, while a part of that period, was not exactly conducive to a restful sleep. It had good historical detail, nice characters, kept your interest, and moved quickly. While this seems to be a love story, there is too much ""blood and guts"" in the book to really consider it a true romance novel."
4,Camp the Troubadour,"Following the success of Gibson and Camp's ""Gate of Horn,"" this album features Hamilton Camp passing through his brief, Dylan-esque troubadour phase. Camp spins together seven (mostly) lesser-known Dylan songs, three quirky arrangements of classic poems, one folk scene staple (""Satisfied Mind""), perhaps the earliest recorded version of Dino Valenti's ""Get Together,"" and his all-time best known original (""Pride of Man""). The tone is a bit earnest -- there is no evidence of the comic rave-ups and wild harmonies of ""Gate of Horn"" -- and Camp's finger-picking and harmonica skills are competent but unspectacular. Nevertheless, Camp's creative voice is authentic, sincere, and passionate, and ""Paths of Victory"" offers one window into the soul of this much under-appreciated artist and captures an interesting glimpse of the fading folk revival."
4,Great!,"Here is one of the x-men's best sister titles. With phenomenal art by Alan Davis and some great writing by Claremont, the classic Excalibur series was witty and original. Great characters and characterization, this a great series. A must have, esp. for fans of Alan Davis and classic Claremont."
5,Recommendation,"This book is true food for thought for every individual, and so beautiful that I started translating it in Dutch, before I even finished reading ""Healing our World"". I do realy hope that Mary's book will be read by many people, all 'round the world, so we can all start practicing the good neighbor policy and Heal our world.Mary, I love you for writing this beautiful gift to us all."
4,French / Latino,"This is a fun collection of twenty two songs by Dean to be enjoyed by the beach or on your patio with your favorite beverage in hand. Close your eyes and you'll be in Paris in April with your arm around your favorite gal.And then Dean takes us South of the Border with Tangerine in A Little Spanish Town. Enjoy , this is definitely a worth while addition to your collection."
4,review of what is wookie:,"This is the 1st book that my Kindergardner read cover to cover, over and over. We were bored with Dick and Jane and I am Sam books this is a great way to share a childs interest with a childs education."
5,Great for Young Readers,"My 6-year-old son is a HUGE fan of Star Wars. We don't let him watch the cartoon and he has only seen the movies once, but he seems to know everything about this fictitious world! So, when I noticed him bringing home the DK readers from the school library (all the little boys race to get them at school every week and he can't always get there first!), I knew just what kind of books to buy so he always has some at home to read. It is very important to have books available on topics kids love so they will love reading! Good job DK. We are amassing quite a library and he is so proud that he can read them himself!"
1,No wookie nookie no wookie cookie!,"This book had very little information. It was not nearly enough for me to complete my CWNA: Certified Wookie Network Administrator Exam. If i don't pass, it's back to Tatooine for me!"
3,Only one page on Wookiees.,"Yes, as others have noted, the title is misleading.There is actually only one page about Wookies, the other pages are about various Star Wars monsters / aliens.Disappointed."
4,"Educational for aunties, too :o)","I read this series of books to my 3 year old nephew. I love them because I am not a Star Wars person but hated not knowing the answers to his questions about it. These books seem to cover everything. Be warned, bedtime readers - these little books are deceptively long!"
2,Let's get lost,"I recently moved to Seattle from a larger city where the street layout followed an erratic and spiraling design. Upon arriving in Seattle, I was nonplussed by the sheer geometry of it's urban organization.I became quickly disorientated by so much regularity that I decided to buy myself a small guide...thinking that maybe I'd get some good restaurant tips in the bargain.Think again.Sure, the cover is a laminated map. However, it's a focalized map of downtown Seattle, so it's handy...when you're in downtown Seattle.As to the info inside, it hasn't served me once...Overall: not much useful info, not many useful street plans.My advice: Save your money on this one, buy a big 8x11 book of street plans, get the commercial info you need online and try out the restos in the Seattle Zagat."
3,Review,Good customer service. Received the item quickly. Only problem is that the silver turns rather quickly; I have to clean it every other day despite its never getting wet. Looks great when clean and shining.
4,Snuggly but a little hard,"The best thing about this pillow is that you can flip from one side position to the other without having to re-arrange all your pillows. Plus it creates a virtual cocoon effect. The only downside is that the filling is a little hard - which works great on the sides, but can cause neck cramps for the head. Overall though, it has been a welcome addition."
5,Changed my Sleep Completely,"This pillow system has completely changed the way I sleep and given me a quality nights sleep from the first night of use. I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering from night pain, stiffness/discomfort. It enabled me to be comfortable without tossing and turning throught the night!"
4,Comfort U Pillow,"I felt immediate relief when I first tried the pillow. It felt very soft and comfortable. It give great support on my shoulders when I sleep on my back, but also helps with lower back pain if I sleep on my side. The warmth of the pillow behind me just feels like being swaddled. I suffer from fibromyalgia and SI joint arthritis. This pillow has been on my list for years! I am happy with it. The only issue is its size. You need a very understanding partner in bed because it takes up a lot of room. I only have a queen-size bed. Would be incredible if I had a king!"
5,Made all the difference for sleep during pregnancy...,"I purchased the comfort u fossfill about two months ago, when I learned I had to sleep on my side while pregnant, which I found difficult and uncomfortable. The pillow has made all the difference -- I am now sleeping wonderfully, and contrary to other reviews here, the pillow has not lost any of its shape. I think those reviews may refer to a different fill, not the fossfill? I recommend the pillow highly -- don't know what I'd have done without it..."
4,My boyfriends,"I got this pillow when I was 6 months pregnant to keep me from rolling over on my belly. I slept on it the other way because it didn't support my neck like I wanted but it was still GREAT! My husband started calling it my boyfriends because it took up a good portion of our king size bed! Oh, I didn't roll on my stomach and was very comfortable the whole night!"
2,Pillow ok,"The pillow is ok, but the fill seems to move a lot and bunch. I'm constantly fluffing. Plan on making a pillow case by hand; the one they provide cuts you at the neck and has protruding zippers that make it uncomfortable to snuggle up with. Also, if you are sleeping 2 to a bed, you need at least a queen size to accomodate this pillow. I'd prefer a king. This pillow really helped me until it got dips from the fill getting moved. Overall it was definitely not worth the money."
5,Comfortable and Sturdy,"I have a 44 pound dog. This lease is perfect for her and me. The tape is smooth and the handle is sturdy, yet comfortable and not too heavy."
1,Where is my refund?,"Amazon sent the wrong item; I reported it and printed out the return label; I returned the item; and presto, no refund after several weeks!"
4,Great Book,This is an engaging and entertaining adventure. This is definitely a book you should have in your library. It gives a very humanistic view of Africa and its people without resorting to stereotypes.
5,"A Sobering tale of survival, still timely","An amazing tale of survival and death. The Captain and crew of a wrecked sailing ship on the coast of Africa, brutally forced into slavery in the harshest of conditions by their Muslim captors. Also a wonderful narration of the life of the camel-based Tuareg lifestyle, and the great caravan trade across the Sahara. Timely still, after 180 years, with the rise of the Muslim world and the involvement of the Tuareg in recent kidnappings and terrorism in Mali."
4,Claddagh,"Maybe because I am from an Irish background,I so enjoyed this book.This is a well written story of a hard working immigrant family and all their trials and tribulations. The matriarch, Sarah, is the soul of this family and the character was well developed. It was easy to get involved in the different characters. I'm looking forward to the sequel. Although I have never been to Scranton, Pa. or worked in a coal mine, it was easy to visualize. Very descriptive. A tearjerker to read. It has all the elements for an enjoyable sojourn."
4,AN ODE TO THE FLEET AIR ARM,"The author, through a skillful economy of words, relates his experiences as a fighter pilot in Britain's Fleet Air Arm through 5 years of war.The Fleet Air Arm, which was detached from the Royal Air Force in the late 1930s, entered the war with several handicaps. One of which was a paucity of quality aircraft. As the war went on and the Fleet Air Arm expanded and was tested in a variety of battles from the Mediterranean (Taranto and Malta) to the Atlantic, the Arctic Ocean, and the Far East, it developed into an invaluable tool in the Allies' efforts to check and defeat the Axis Powers.Popham's experiences in the Far East, Madagascar, and in the Mediterranean are lllustrative of what the Fleet Air Arm accomplished. He writes with understatement, which nevertheless succeeds in giving the reader a clear view of how the war shaped him."
2,Great Seller but the product doesn't work AT ALL,"I know the seller is great, but the item that i purchased doesn't work at all, i tried everything to make the Radio Transmitter work, but i didn't had luck, is not that EASY TO USE as it supposed to be, in fact it's not for use, it doesn't works at all, i don't know what more can i do to make it work, 2 stars is too much for the way i feel now..."
1,Whaaattt?!!!,"This book is $14.95 from Presto, brand new!! Why would anyone pay $87 or over $1,000 for it?????!!!!"
3,ok..it's overpriced...but,why haven't any of you actually reviewed the cookbook? Is it a worthwhile purchase..from Presto or 2nd hand?
1,$40 for a cookbook that sells for $14.95 new?,I JUST PURCHASED A PRESTO ELECTRIC SKILLET AND ENCLOSED WITH THE PRODUCT IS AN ORDER FORM FOR THE SUBJECT COOKBOOK WHICH IS AVAILABLE FOR $14.95 PLUS $3.50 FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING. SINCE I ALWAYS CHECK AMAZON FOR BOOK PRICES I WAS ASTOUNDED TO SEE THE SAME BOOKBOOK BEING OFFERED FOR $40. DON'T UNDERSTAND! NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM NOT PURCHASING THE $40 COOKBOOK.
1,NO WAY,Same here. Now the price on this book is $87.50 for a $14.95 book. I got the offer too and I have had my skillet a few years. I don't get it either. Something is way wrong here.
5,alarm the neigbours.,"If you want the neighbours to be saying ' what the bloody hell is going on in there?' then play this record loudly. great stuff, beginning to end."
2,"Historic, But Not Enjoyable","For at least a year I have been looking for an opportunity to hear this CD, which has been rated by multiple critics as ""historic."" After finally securing a copy, I agree that this CD is worth reviewing for it's historic value. However, I do not find Abbey Lincoln's screaming on track 3 particularly enjoyable to listen to."
5,a must have for the archives,"This is a classic: Max Roach, Olatunji, Abbey Lincoln.... need I say more? I'm thoroughly pleased with this work of art. Highly recommended!"
2,Mediocre textbook,"I used this book in junior high school, and I remember having a hard time learning from it. I wish my school had followed the pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, precalculus, etcetera track--even my teachers said it was a bad textbook."
1,Where is the 1ST MARINE DIVISION?,"I was in the 1st Mar. Div. - 5th Mar. Regiment. and ""landed"" on New Guinea, New Britain, Guadalcanal, Peleliu, Okinawa, and China.Perhaps Okinawa was much the longest and fiercest battle of them all, with the most casualties the 1st Marine Division received, anywhere. In reading the book it seems that the 1ST MARINE DIVISION, 5TH REGIMENT - - (that's ""5th MARINES""), - WASN'T EVEN THERE!! ` Maybe they were dreaming!!"
5,Awesome!!!,"One must, or should, visit Okinawa to get a true appreciation for the story of this epic battle. The author does a masterful job of putting you right in the thick of the fight. You can almost smell the gore and hear the sounds of battle. Of particular interest to me were the accounts of how the Japanese trained their troops. One can better understand their dedication to their Emporer when one sees the brutal ""indoctrination"" these Japanese troops received. As a U. S. Marine for 21+ years I have been fortunate enough to have been stationed on the island of Okinawa several times. I have toured the battlefields where so many fought and died. This book put me right there in 1945 with the Marines of that time. The book is a must read for all who have an interest in military history in general and in the Pacific campaigns of WWII specifically. I would recommend it enthusiastically and without reservation. Outstanding work Mr. Feifer!!!"
3,The net,I wasn't expecting an aquarium fish net I was expecting an out side fish pond net but you live and learn. The handle is to short even extended I still have to bend over to use it. I need to read the descriptions better. I had to put an extension on the handle so I wouldn't have to get on my knees to use it. It is a well made net regardless. .
3,not real happy with this,"I smelled this in the store and loved it,kind of spendy amazon much less than store .wish i would have paid price at dept store this does not smell anything like in the store very disappointed"
1,Expired Perfume,"I know this perfume well, and this is definitely expired. I know this scent has been discontinued, but since GA Wholesale Liquidation was still selling it, I hoped that the product would still be good. Nope."
2,strong!,The smell is stronger than I expected. That is why I like going to the store and smelling perfumes first.
1,Black by Kenneth Cole Scentless,I was very disappointed in this product. Must have been old as it did not hold it's scent past putting it on!
5,Retro fun!,"If you like Monster Mash, you'll love Zacherly! This is a great trip to 1950s horror host novelty recordings. Wonderful baby boomer memories, and a great addition to any fun Halloween party playlists!."
3,The Cool Ghoul,This cd sounds like it was transferred from low quality mp3's.I have the original 1960 lp and the album sounds much better than this disk.This doesn't take away from Zach's songs just that the quality you would expect from a cd isn't there.
5,Useful--even for a non-law enforcement reader,"This book is a well-organized collection of information. I have no background in law enforcement, criminal justice or even psychology. Yet, I understood it well. Anyone interested in taking the time to understand in some depth how these criminals think and act would learn a great deal. It really illustrates the development of criminal profiling techniques. The book is broken into sections, each of which is broken into chapters. It is written by a group of people, including: Robert Ressler (FBI), John Douglas (FBI), Anne Burgess (nurse/researcher), a medical examiner."
2,nice looking but don't buy,great looking bird bath but the heater stay on constantly and leaks water like a sieve
2,Has potential,"This is a neat idea, but we had to return two of them and finally gave up. I hope they fix the issues as the unit is very attractive. The first unit leaked. The second one arrived with some of the pebbling already fallen off the side. I also noticed that although the ad says the thermostat only kicks in when it is cold, the one we actually used kept the water warm when the temp was is the 50's. Too bad!!"
5,It Works!,"I was hesitant about buying this heated bird bath but it does work. I live in Memphis and we don't have much snow but we do have lots of below freezing temperatures and ice. I feed birds and 7 feral cats. I have been struggling for years to keep unfrozen water for all of them. I received my bird bath yesterday when the temp was 43 degrees. I set it out, filled it with water but did not plug it in. (I covered the electric line with straw which hid it from the animals and made it look good too.) Light snow was predicted last night so I then plugged it in and this morning the ground was dusted with about an inch of snow. But I was happily surprised to see my wonderful, unfrozen bird bath. And it really does look like a little stone pond. I and my cats and birds are so happy."
2,Very disappointed,The sand texture finish comes off very easily leaving a slippery black plastic which the birds do not like. I'm hoping I can put some small pebbles in for them to stand on. The heating part works great and keeps the water warm. For the price I am disappointed.
3,Really liked it a lot! But eventually the fake rock stuff came off,"I bought this several years ago and like it a lot. The fake grainy stuff keeps birds from slipping and it has a shallow end and a deeper end.I don't know whether it stays on all the time like the other reviewer mentioned, I never noticed. It did keep ice from forming and only in Jan on truly windy and freezing nights there would be a little rim of ice around the outside. I haven't had the leaking problems either. I wonder, since I bought mine 3 years ago whether quality has gone down since as with so many other things?My only problem, (I suppose it can't be expected to last forever) is that the grainy fake rock liner separated from the black plastic unit it covers, once a hole in that developed and water could get underneath the whole lining went down hill fairly fast.I will now be replacing it. Probably with another one since there aren't that many choices out there."
4,"Farm Innovators ""Four Seasons"" Sand Coated Ground Birdbath Pretty Good - Could Be Just a Little More Durable, Though","The Farm Innovators ""Four Seasons"" Sand Coated Ground Birdbath is Pretty Good - It Could Be Just a Little More Durable, Though.It hold one Gallon of water, It keeps the water from freezing and the water is just barely warm, which the birds and squirrels seem to like. The edge of the sand-coated bowl material chipped in a couple of places from outdoor handling, but it works good. That's why I believe it could be a little more durable because it is used outdoors."
4,Great winter bird attraction,"This holds quite a bit of water, so it doesn't need constant refilling. We've had some below-zero temps this winter and the water has remained unfrozen. It remains to be seen how long the unit lasts, though -- some reports on heated birdbaths say they only last one season. Won't know about this one until next winter!"
5,"Farm Innovators ""Four Seasons"" Sand Coated Ground Birdbath - Tan; Model FS-1, 60-Watt","Farm Innovators ""Four Seasons"" Sand Coated Ground Birdbath - Tan; Model FS-1, 60-Watt ....I have had this birth bath for about two weeks. I love this bird bath. I have had no problems with the bird bath. When it's cold out the water will steam and evaporate slowly. It holds one gallon of water. Very easy to dump and rinse out. Light weight and can dump it with one hand. You will enjoy it...."
2,Surface pieces came off before even used,The surface has a black spot where the grainy surface was worn off. It does work and the birds are happy but I likely won't be taking a brush to it to clean as more is likely to flake off. I would not purchase this product again.
3,Very Expensive to run,"I really liked the idea of having water for the birds, cats and all the other animals in the winter. But OMG my electric bill almost doubled, Jan bill $197.00, Feb bill $163.00. That is RIDICULOUS! I know it is the bird bath because it is the only thing new using electric since December. They should tell people exactly how much electric these things use. If I had known, I wouldn't have purchased it."
4,Water stays warm,Have operated on the colder days and nights below freezing. Keeps water warm to the touch. Water needs regular refilling since the warmer water evaporates faster than cold. Good item for the wild birds and squirrels.
3,How Very 1968!,"Ok. I sampled this album and thought I'd take a chance and I am glad I did. The opening track ""In Her Mind"" is the epitomy of groovy late '60's psychedelia. The ""perfect"" song. However, I must comment about the quality of the sound on the CD. It is definitely not from a master source and pixelates uncannily like an MP3. Not cool. Hey Sundazed! What gives?"
5,Very Good Deal,"While installing a new bilge pump in my boat, I need 3/4"" tubing to connect to the thru-hull fitting.This tubing was less than half the price for the same tubing at the boat store and I have 15 feet left over for other projects like my baitwell plumbing."
1,Not all tubes are the same,"I ordered it to put together an automatic sprinkling system for my lawn. This was much cheaper than PVC tubes in stores and online elsewhere, and I figured a tube is a tube. When it got here two things were amiss.First, we were puzzled when it didn't fit the 3/4' fittings we had gotten for the project. It was thinner, and when we measured it, it turned out to be 5/8' instead of 3/4'.Second, the material felt different from the PVC tubes we'd seen in stores. We took it to Lowe's to compare. The rep there commented it is rubber, not PVC (plastic). I am no expert on tubing material so I'd take it with a grain of salt, but I want to flag it here and maybe the seller can comment. When comparing to other 3/4' tubes there, it is obviously thinner and we confirmed it is 5/8'.All in all, the tube we got was not 3/4, and I am suspicious of the material."

4,Wiggle while you work!,"I have to say, the thought of sitting on a ball while working at my computer was a little ""weird"" at first, but let me tell ya, I'm a bit on the hyper side and being able to move around and not sit still all day - LOVE IT!!The pump is cheap..but it worked! Love the ball.I'm 5'10"" and got the extra large. Probably could've gone with the large..but what the heck!"
5,85 cm ball,"I'm only 5'6"" but I bought the 85 cm ball because I wanted to practice back bending. I absolutely LOVE my ball, it's one of the greatest things I've ever bought. I do all sorts of stretching and fun things on it, you can use it for any of a million+++ different reasons. It's also great for relaxing and stretching."
4,Huge,"Almost too big, but it does have description saying for 6'9'' and taller. It is a bit too big to use as a computer/desk chair (I was hoping to use it for this) and way too big for someone under six feet tall to use at all. If you are 6'6'' or taller, you will love this....I am 6'3'' and it is okay, almost too big, but I like it...Probably would have gotten the 75cm ball, but if you are keen on an extra large ball, you will love it. It feels very solid."
4,Pump is useless,"The ball is definitely huge! However, the pump that comes with it is completely useless and even with other pumps the ball is very hard to get blown up all the way so that sitting on it doesn't squish it down halfway to the floor. It does not seem as durable as other balls in the same price range. I'm sure that it would be fine, but in the end it was too big for me"
4,Nice,This exercise ball is ideal if you are on the shorter side. It makes some of the exercises much more doable and therefore you will be more likely to succeed in your endeavors
1,feel poisoned by the strong smell,"very unpleasant smell,so not good to put in bedroom. tiresome pumping up. the color is as bright as I want."
3,too small for below 5 feet,"I ordered this fitness ball for my girlfriend who's just below 5 feet which fits the recommendation in the description. But upon fully pumped, it's still too small for her to use. So we got another ball the next size up which works really well.That said, there are no complaints about the pump and ball so maybe the recommendation works for others. Thus the three stars."
4,Don't buy a ball too large!!,"I am 5'10 and I bought the large ball... omg huge mistake it is way too large. Being a dude, I was unfamiliar with yoga balls and thought it was a one size fits all thing (my bad), just future buyers beware."
4,Smelly ball,"I love the color and size of this ball, but it has a very strong chemicle rubber smell. I left it outside to air out for a few days, but even that didn't help."
3,"Pleasant, but STEREOTYPICAL!","This movie was a pleasant kids film with lots of action scenes--surfing & snowbording. Good, original plot, and a great character in Johnny Kaphaala, since he is a young man with integrity, smarts, kindness & courage.What disturbed me most about this film was the sterotypes of the Black friend, Sam, and the white rich kids, the Skys. I don't understand why the Black guy always gotta be the ""hip"" one, saying things like ""it's all good"", etc. (actually Johnny says that but you know what I'm talking about). Like that one Black character said in ""Not Another Teen Movie"". It was ridiculous that the Black kid was the epitome of cool, with his ""dreadlocked"" snow hat.Then the rich white kids' leader, Brett, was the nastiest of nasties. Rude beyond belief. I don't know, I just didn't like the portrayal of good vs. bad in this film. They coulda mixed it up racially more, but hey, I guess it was Vermont...(am I stereotyping Vermont now? lol!)"
1,Not a review,"I have found this movie at tower records, Dimple, and many other places for $4. Charging this much for a movie is totally ripping everyone off. The movie wasent that good, and you really need to lower the price if you want people to buy this junk. Sorry"
5,Heart and Soul,"This is a great movie! Johnny's parents are not very good ""listeners,"" but his Grandfather is completely there for him. It's a Disney movie formula, but there's some truth to it...a kid doesn't really require a "" village,"" but he does need one adult in the world that he is really connected with.Johnny Tsunami also has a lot to say about surfing and skiing and what it's like to be the new kid in school.CLM"
5,JOHNNY IS THE MAN,"ok if you like anything that has to do with snow or a beach u will die for this movie, such a killer movie with amazing soundtrack, no other movie like it best of all"
5,Johnny Tsunami,"I totally love this delightful very easy to watch Disney movie. Love the characters, scenery, and storyline. I think the grandfather rocks!"
3,Where is the DVD?,"I just bought Johnny Kapahala-Back on Board on DVD, but this movie is still not available that way, I want both on DVD, not the 1st. on VHS and 2nd. on DVD."
1,Looking back and doubling over,"This book is an excellent example of why Justin Wilson should have retired years ago. With the release of 'Looking Back', Justin is milking his fans one last time. These recipes are reprints of recipes that he has put into his other books, and are just plain not that good. His humor has gotten worse over the years, so you feel almost a sense of sadness when you try to read his little stories. Save the money and your health."
3,"A Summary of Epic Scholarship, but not worth the money","This Book basically summarizes Epic Scholarship from the 19th Century, to more or less the present. All the fammilar names are here, from Holtzmann to Hiltebeitel, with short summaries of their work. Not surprisingly there is not much emphasis on the Philosophical Sections of the Mahabharata, nor are there new insights shared, or conclusions reached. It is more or less a Reference Book, not always reliable, of Epic Scholarship. For the beginning Student this might be helpful as the extensive Bibliography lists most of the important work published.As with other Books in this Series, that of Brill (see my Review on ""Essays on the Mahabharata"") and other ""similar"" publishers, the price is insane. Who would possibly pay $183.50 for this?Again, an invitation to go to your local University Library for a long Photocopying Session. These Publishers must learn to price their books in a realistic manner, or suffer the consequences."
2,Ambitious but it fails to provide new synthesis,"The book is encycolpaedic in its survey of earlier scholarship--that is its strength. But it leaves out crucial new evidence from the fields of history of science and astronomy in India, and from archaeology that compel a fresh look at old assumptions. For example, the Sarasvati river is now believed to have dried up around 2000 BC and a pilgrimage to its tirthas by Balarama is an important episode in the Mahabharata. Brockington nowhere examines such issues."
1,"Apologists for public schools get an ""F"" in research.","It is typical of our marginally educated educators in this country to bungle their research. Carnoy's book is an example. They make absolute comparisions of student proficiencies after controlling for the some of the demographic and socio-economic effects but in so doing they leave out the most important factor of all: How did the students compare with their regular public school cohorts when they entered charter schools? Perhaps lost to these ed-researchers is the fact that charter schools attract low performers compared to the public school alternatives. The real measure of a quality school is not children's absolute performance, but how much do they improve year over year. On that measure, charter schools are signficantly superior to their regular public school counterparts."
3,It won't teach you the language unless you put in a huge amount of time!,If you are really interested in Norwegian and have the time to put into a reading course like this it may be able to teach you the basics. It is structured well and organized simple enough for most people to understand. The problem is the course is very limited and does not really help you learn what you need to learn in everyday conversation. I would recommend buying this with a English Norwegian dictionary and perhaps another companion Norwegian learning book to reference in some cases. Alone it CAN do the job but it might be a bit tough.
4,Good set,"My only complaint is the CD was a little hard to use because it went through everything at a breakneck pace. You can't use it much without the book. Each chapter has only a few minutes of audio and I was always rewinding. That's not to say it wasn't a very useful addition to the book, especially for something as hard to learn to pronounce as Norwegian. It's just not something you can use in the car.Overall though, the course is very well done and is a great deal for the price."
2,Teach Yourself Norwegian,"When trying to learn a foreign language while at home the great challenge is to hear the target language spoken, especially with a language like Norwegian that is in no sense an international language. In the Teach Yourself package you get 2 CDs and a ridiculous amount of space on them is wasted by the English chatter of the teacher. Also, the tone of voice in which she constantly whines ""Do you understand?"" ought to be a hanging offense."
4,good for selflearners,Good book but if you have not learned any language before on your own then it is not the way for you...
4,A Coming of Age Book for Teens!,"This unique book is a 52 week motivational journal geared especially for teens. Full of real-life examples, Mr. G. takes the teen through a year long soul searching, guiding the student in finding their own Biblically-based standards. Mr. G. provides challenges for the teen with each week, challenges that encourage the student to decide on their own the best route for their life. Mr. G. isn't afraid to touch on sensitive topics such as the current day political climate, as well as discussing everyday topics. A Winner By Any Standards is a wonderful coming-of-age guidebook for all Christian teens."
5,Simple installation,"I've installed a few faucets over the years, and this one was by far the easiest to install. Took longest to remove the old one, probably put the new one in in under 20 minutes. Very simple method, anyone can do it. Simple homeowner tools are all that is needed."
2,"It is a novel, not history",If you are a serious student of World War II you'd better stay away from this book because it is just a novel with many dramatic dialogues which come straight out of author's fantasy and although it is based on historic facts it is not to be used as a source for the scholar.
5,Awesome Ring,I absolutely LOVE this ring! I'm not too much of jewelry person and hesitant to make big purchases. But I really liked the design and decided to take the risk and purchase this online. I couldn't have been more pleased. I loved the design when I first saw it but have to say the picture doesn't do it justice. It's a beautiful ring with a very comfortable fit. And doesn't get caught on anything so you can wear it all the time. Lots of sparkle!
5,My favorite LPA alblum,"I have seen the Commander with and without the Lost Planet Airmen over many years... I own most of the titles listed here in Amazon, but this is by far the most bang for the buck. I have introduced many friends to the Commander by gifting this CD. After more than 25 years of listening to the band ... this is one of my all time favorite alblums in my music collection. This CD captures the band at the zenith of it's artistic arc. For a group that has a reputation for great live performances, this is the place to start."
1,Smart Fork,"Too big and clumsy to use --- you're stabbing the meat, but can't see the reading. We grilled chops last night to well done (little moisture left) yet the fork reading only got up to 134 degrees."
1,Sad.,"For Christmas last year, my husband had mentioned wanting a good meat thermometer (to several people), and ended up with two different ones. This one was the immediate hit because of the buttons and high-tech look. This is also the one that got tossed in the trash because it consistently read 70+ degrees low (I stuck it in boiling water and confirmed). Extremely disappointing, do not waste your money. We've moved on the the less techy but infinitely more useful old gauge-type."
1,Cheap plastic on Polder fork oozes a sticky chemical,"This fork worked at first. But after about a year of infrequent and careful use, the gray plastic body oozed a sticky chemical that made it useless. It would not wash off with soap and water. And when we tried to clean it with solvent, the cooking legend on the back of the fork came off.As a result of this bad experience with their defective material, I will not be buying any other products from Polder."
1,"WORST BOOK I EVER READ, what a disappointment!","I didn't want to give this book even one star, but that doesn't seem to be an option here ... in a word, this book was AWFUL. Sure, it has a catchy, clever title, but that is IT! I was disappointed after a few chapters, but kept going since it was a fast, short read, and also was hoping and expected so much more. Where were juicy details about the protagonist's crush on GB? Hardly anything, and her encounters at the end - left me flat. There was too much about the quirky yet boring details of her daily existence, which was weird to say the least. Per the title, the premise of the book could have had potential, but the author blew it. Just my humble opinion."
1,Poor Form - Lacks Original Research,"As the reviewer from Jackhorn, KY stated, this book lacks original research. If you read the section on the ""house church movement"" and then go to the website for The Homechurch Homepage, you will see that Mr. Wolfe hacked away at many of the articles on the site to obtain his ""research."" For the many quotes he used from the website, not once were any of the authors contacted by Mr. Wolfe in order to do any original research. If he had done so, he would have come away with a different take than he wrote in his book."
5,Yeh Shen,"Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditonas described, packaged well.Would use again."
2,china cinderella,"did not liked the book, I thought the pictures were going to be brighter.Excellent delivery."
5,Leslie in Jensen Bch,"I have this album & love it, so I had to have it on CD. It brings back so many great memories & I still remember most of the words....Rock On"
2,Be Very Careful,"I really, really like this book and agree with the author's big picture method. I did it faithfully for months and added weight and watched my body shrink and look great. Then one day I started getting odd pain in my hip while on the leg press. It wasn't muscular, it felt like bones grinding together. Guess what? It was! My muscles could lift 140lbs but my joint could not and now I have bursistis in that hip which prevents me from doing many, many exercises. It's a tremendous bummer for me-- I'm 39 and have pain squatting, going up stairs, and on most cardio machines. It is a chronic condition from using too much weight--that is what the doctor said. I spent 6 months not exercising because of it and now am very limited in any exercise that involves repetitive hip motion (uh, that would be most exercises).Ultimately, a great body can be had from doing lighter weights. And it is far less dangerous. I wish I had just used common sense."
4,Good book to get you into weight training,"The book is well structured into a program of 12 weeks of 3 rutines per week. Everything is layout for you, the types of exercises, the weight to lift, the number of repetions, and the rest time between sets. After the first week the author varies the types of exercises and each week also there is a different type of training method. The author uses the ""take you by your hand"" approach which is very effective for those who need guidance or motivation to start with a training program. I wish the author would have included more exercises types per muscle group, for example there is only one exercise for tricep,and 2 for biceps. Also the muscle groups at the back of the book should have been organized in a more logical fashion for an easier search."
2,Not what I wanted at all,"This may be a good book for someone who is just starting out in weight training, but even at that I don't think it's worth the price. Most of the book is charts for you to fill in with weight lifted and reps during your workouts, which you could easily make yourself on a spreadsheet. There are relatively few exercises described, and really no workout options to speak of. If you're ready to slavishly follow this author's ideas (which aren't backed up with any evidence in particular), then it's a complete package deal. I prefer to have some evidence to convince me that one strategy is better than another, since exercise books differ so widely in what they tell you.You could get much more and better information for planning a workout routine, and far better descriptions and pictures of exercises, for free at exrx.net."
5,Great way to start...,"This book really gets you into the process in a simple and concise way. I really like the workouts and how detailed the book is (starting weight levels, exercise description, etc.). Also, I really like that you can track your progress so that you don't have to remember exactly what weight you lifted. I look forward to buying the second version!"
4,Great starter book,This is a great book if you are serious about lifting. It will give you a good start for more advanced routines by teaching you the how and the why of what you are doing. Definately a good buy!
2,Okay book for beginners,"This book is only good for the beginner. Also, this book doesn't go into the reasons why you should be doing what you're doing. It just tells you to do it. I don't like that approach but some people might. I bought this book in conjunction with 'Bodybuilding a Realistic Approach : How You Can Have a Great Body' by Frank Melfa and liked the latter one a lot more. The latter one is appropriate for the beginner to somewhat knowledgeable person interested in lifting weights. You will surpass James Orvis book in about 1 month (if not less) so save yourself the money and get the other, more complete book."
3,Weight Training Workouts that Work,"Not much of anything that the novice doesn't already know. Easy reading, but pretty basic information."
2,"Pretty good, but.....","It was a good book, but I was looking for something more. Maybe I was just looking for TOO much. This seems like a GREAT book for someone who is just starting to work out, but not much info for someone who is already in a routine."
2,"Good 12 week starter routine, but that's all it is.","First off, I believe this book to be suitable for a beginner. If you have already been lifting six months to a year and are looking for fresh workout ideas, I wouldn't bother buying the book. There are better books (and web sites) out there for your needs.My biggest gripe is that there is only one 12 week workout plan. When buying I did not realize that the ""workouts"" in the title would mean the workouts that make up each week of one single 12 week plan."
5,Just Right for Me,"I have been going to the gym for more than 3 years now running on a treadmill and once in a great while lifting a few weights when the gym was very empty. I honestly did understand the basic lifts prior to joining the gym but I really didn't have a total easy to follow program. I'd buy training magazines but I always was left with was this for beginners or someone who has lifted for years. This book is great for beginners or those who are unsure as to where to start. Great book, I'm so glad I bought it. I have been using it for 7 weeks now and actually have seen results; I plan on buying his second book once I have finished this one. I do agree with some of the others, this book isn't for someone who has lifted for years with results, nor does he suggest what to do aerobically but again this is weight training workouts that work not running for beginners."
2,Waste of time and money,"Very, very, very (did I mention very) limited / basic info. on weight lifting. If you haven't dropped one too many dumbells on your head, you should know more than what's in this book. I think it was written in the 70's based on the pictures and text. There ane MANY more helpful books out there and I guess I'll chalk this one up as a lose!!"
2,"Well, It might work.... for a few weeks.....","The book is actually realy good,it tells you what to do and when to do it, the problem is that the routines didn't work, at least not for me.If you want something that works more than a few weeks, I can only recommend you, ""Your guide to XLNT fitness"" from www.xlntfitness.com"
5,Get This Book,"If you're looking for an easy way to lose weight and tone up you can't go wrong with this book. The workouts are planned for you, all you need to do is follow them. I take my book to the gym and follow it faithfully. In the past few months I have lost 4% body fat and a few pounds (I was not overweight to start with, just wanted to be more toned). Everyone has told me how great I look. I'm really impressed with the results from weight training and will continue to make this a big part of my workouts."
4,Intro to Lifting Free Weights,One must be careful in technique to gain maximum physical benefit and avoid injury while lifting free weights. This book covers both dumbells and barbells. A must-have for the beginner.
5,Chemical handling in the laboratory,"Excellent resource for lab directors, chemical hygiene officers and laboratory technicians. Recommended reference by ASU's Office of Environmental Technology for their Health and Safety Training Courses."
4,Lifeline Power wheel,I purchased the lifeline power wheel for my wife. She works out every day at the gym and this seemed like a good next step in her fitness quest! This is a no-nonsense piece of equipment and works great BUT is not for the weekend fitness person. It is excellent for your core muscle development but requires much determination to stick with it and not let it become a door stop! Very simple and highly recommended but please read up on it or better yet find one at a gym and try it or ask about it from a professional.Lifeline USA Power Wheel II
5,"How good is this? I loved it, and I don't even do Xmas!","As a longtime fan of Ann Hodgman, I bought this book because I thought she would have some nice points about reducing holiday stress, and because I knew she'd make me laugh.Right on both points. As I said, I don't celebrate Christmas, but I have relatives who do. And as a mother with school-age kids, it's difficult not to get caught up the whole generic-holiday whirl.Yay, Ann, once again--a wonderful book! Not only do I recommend this for buying for yourself, it's a perfect gift for a frazzled friend to read BEFORE the leaves start falling this year. She includes just a few recipes, but I highly recommend her recipes for grapefruit terrine and for cut-out sugar cookies that don't spread into unrecognizable blobs. (I used to make dreidel-shaped cookies that bore a spooky resemblance to Xmas trees before I spread the blue frosting on them.)"
3,So-So holiday advice,This author is a little strange in her thinking and advice. Don't waste your money.
5,An Absolute Masterpiece!,"For me, this album was instrumental in my becoming a singer, based on the structure and lyrical content of the songs selected. Valerie Simpson is absolutely phenominal on every lyric she sings, and Nick Ashford completly wrecks the house in his ""rap"" on ""Over and Over"". However, the opus ""If You're Lying"" closes out what I consider to be the second best album this duo released. BUY THIS CD!"
1,AWFUL REMASTERING,THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE THE WORST REMASTERING OF ANY OF THIER WARNER BROS RELEASES. IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE SINGING IN A TUNNEL VERY MUDDY. ITS LIKE A RECORD BEING PLAYED WITH A WORN NEEDLE. WHOEVER REMASTERED THIS SHOULD BE APPALLED. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A GREAT CD RE RELEASE AS ITS A GREAT ALBUM...SUCH A SHAME I CANT BEAR TO LISTEN TO THE VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY. IF YOU CAN FIND THIER OTHER WARNERS RELEASES ON CD GO GET THEM THEY ARE MUCH BETTER SOUND QUALITY
3,SATISFIED,"THE ALBUM TITLED SONG IS THE BEST. SO SO SATISFIED EXPRESSES JUST HOW I FEEL WHEN I HEAR IT. THE SONG EMITS NOTHING BUT LOVE AND INTIMACY. I CAN JUST IMAGINE HOW CLOSE THEY FELT WHILE SINGING THIS BEAUTIFUL DUET. I'VE ONLY CARED FOR A FEW OF THEIR SONGS, BUT THIS ONE,""FLOATS MY BOAT"". MAYBE ONE DAY THEY WILL DO ANOTHER SONG OF THIS CALLIBER, UNTIL THEN, I HOPE THEY KEEP ON, KEEPIN ON!"
3,Mattel needs better production values,"yes I realize Mattel only produces the movies to sell the dolls but it would be nice if the production values were better. mostly these do not look as good as the $1.00 cartoons a the dollars store. these really have fallen behind in the CGA department. the story here has a bit more appeal than in the fairytopia ones , a bit referential to Cinderella's stepmother IMHO, butthey do allow for some conflict which moves the story along more than in the other ones. I just wish they'd spend more money to make these better.even older kids 7 or 8 are used to better produced films with better animation"
3,Good message; same stilted graphics.,"Our 7 year old and 2 year old girls enjoyed this immensely, and the colors are brilliant. They were easily entranced by the emotions of the story. I was a little disappointed to see how stilted the movements were for a ""dance"" film. I would have hoped that they would have worked that out from previous Barbie installments.This is safe entertainment for little ones with a bit of classic theater, dance, and music education thrown in."
4,beautiful but why is Rowena harsh,"i love this movie and its very beautiful.but genivieve and her 11 sisters are treated harshly by their own cousin(the reason is that she is an adult).The punishments from her to them promote child labor and she emotionally abuses them which is child abuse.if king randolph died from being poisoned by rowena,genivieve and her sisters would become orphens and rowena would turn them into scullary maids.but lukily that didn't happen.i hope people enjoy this movie!"
3,"Ok, but not the best","I'm not under 13, but I didn't want to share my e-mail.This movie was very sweet. The dancing and music was elegant, but it lacked the beauty of the previous princess movies. I'm annoyed by three things:1. The story seems broken up, with things happening unexplained and for no reason.2. Although the movie promotes family bonding, it seemed that the sisters were divided into little groups and didn't have very strong relationships with the girls not in their groups.3. My last concern is that it might be a little intense for young children. The monkey freaked out my kids, and Barbie is nearly killed.Overall, this movie is ok. It's nice and sure to be liked, but it's not worth buying."
4,The best Barbie movie to date!,"The Twelve Dancing Princesses is the best Barbie Movie to date. The twelve dancing princesses are sisters who have lost their mother. Their loving father hires his cousin, Duchess Rowena, to help the girls act more princess like. She takes away their dancing privledges and begins her evil plan to poison their father and take over the kingdom. The girls escape to a secret pavilion where they dance to their hearts' content and magical things happen. When they find out about Rowena's evil plan, they work together to get rid of her. The animation is great. The scenes are beautiful. My daughters love it and watch it over and over."
4,My 3 year old Granddaughter,"My granddaughter is a HUGE Barbie fan and loves all things Barbie. She loves this movie and her mother has to watch it repeatedly!More Barbie, we want more Barbie!"
4,Enjoyable,"Movie has music, dancing and punishment. It is a fun movie for little girls who love to dance and pretend to be a princess."
3,Just the dad,This is a great movie for a seven year old girl enamored with Barbies and princesses. Don't expect that anyone else in the family will be crazy about it.
5,Daughter loves it,My daughter loves this! I am amazed that Mattel is actually able to create stories that aren't just cookie-cutter stuff and make some unique and interesting story lines that hold children's interest.
5,Fun for young and old dreamers,"Bought this for my little granddaughters when I last visited them. The three year old LOVED it -- the music is beautiful and the dancing sequences intrigued her. She donned her own princess dresses and danced along, then wanted to see it again immediately when it was over. All the females in the house enjoyed this DVD and I would recommend it heartily. It's basically another version of the Cinderella story."
4,Seems to satisfy my children more than me!,"If you are new to the Barbie line of movies then you will be pleasantly suprised. This movie has a week story line and plot, but my two daughters have not seemed to tire of the movie. I would recommend Barbie in The Nutcracker over this one, but I have watched the movie several times and have found it to be watchable."
2,it was okmovie was kind of lo,"movie was kind of long and boring,my girls got a little bored because the movie was not a attention getter,but for the price ok"
5,Standard Barbie movie.,"This DVD is pretty up to par with the rest of the Barbie movies. We did feel it needed more singing, though. In any event, our 3-year-old enjoyed it."
5,My daughter loved it.,"My daughter loved it. We own all of Barbie movies, and this was my daughter's favorite. Her and I both do Ballet so as a parent I enjoyed it too."
2,Just okay,Not one of the better Barbie movies. Some parts dragged -- prior Barbie movies had much better action scenes and more suspense. This movie had too many obvious components and left nothing to the imagination. The evil cousin who attempted to take over from the king was not a great villian. The scenery in the magic 'dancing' land was very pretty but the story line was just too dull.
5,Loved By Three Princesses,"My daughters are 6 yrs, 4 yrs, and almost 2 yrs old and they all love this movie. We initially DVR'd the movie from Nickelodeon, but the ending kept getting cut off. Then Santa found the movie here on Amazon for half of what even Walmart was charging for it, and we knew we had to get it for our girls. It's been one of their favorite Christmas gifts,and inspired our girls to dress as Genevieve for Halloween, to wear the costumes at every family party we've had since Halloween including birthdays, and to dance around the house pretending to be ballerinas. It's sparked their imagination and they love the bright colors and the music. Definitely worth the money just to see our daughters enjoy it."
5,"My daughter is 7, what more do I need to say","My daughter loves the Barbie DVD's. She has quite a few of them. She was very excited about receiving this DVD since she is a big fan of the original book ""The 12 Dancing Princess."" Even though the DVD does not follow the story excactly didn't seem to bother my daughter at all. If you have a young daughter, this DVD will make you a personal hero for her if you get if for her."
4,good barbie movie,This was a good barbie movie. Not the best in the Barbie series. But if your kids like dancing they will enjoy this one.
3,Barbie version of a fairy tale,"Not bad. Colorful, fun for the children to watch. Fun ending. Girls love the dance scenes."
3,A little disappointing,"The animation is fantastic, but I found the story to be quite boring. It lacks the adventure of previous Barbie movies, such as Mermaidia and The Nutcracker, and I believe that the dance scenes in Swan Lake are far superior to the ones in this movie. It even took my 3-year-old a while to get into it."
5,"Sturdy, works as expected, inexpensive","I needed a switch because I found myself in a situation where I needed greater flexibility with my cordless plantronics phone (little pad clips to the belt so that you can walk around 300' from the charging station hands-free). When I bought the phone, I wanted it so that I could walk around with incoming calls (forwarded by a reception service to a magicjack number), but I quickly realized that the flexibility would be great for out-bound calls as well. A simple switch was the solution, and this is that simple switch. Mechanical and simple, 2 positions, piece of cake. No brainer."
1,Didn't work,"It just never worked...lol. Either I'm an idiot or this product is junk. It came with no instructions which is no suprise considering what a basic concept it is....but no matter what I did, it never worked."
5,Works,"Actually better quality than I was expecting for the price. Otherwise, not much to say about a simple piece of hardware. Is that enough words yet?"
3,Where's The Rest Of It?,"Being a hardcore fan of Guns and Roses I know that this is not the complete footage of the concert. It only went for a little over an hour and we all know that Guns N' Roses concerts went on average 2/3 hours and includes a drum solo, Slash's solo, and Duff's solo, and you can always count on Axl's rantings and ravings of abuse at the croud. However these were all edited out of this DVD. If you want to see a more complete concert I suggest the Use Your Illusions I & II or if you want to see Axl in all his glory then Welcome To Destruction 2004 is a must, it's the footage of the St. Louis concert complete with Axl leaping into the crowd to take out a fan as well as a security guard and cause a riot. MUST HAVE!"
1,Do not buy it,"Horrible audio and video quality, appears to be a VHS ripped to dvd by an amateur dvd author. The most ugly dvd menus I've ever seen. Edited concert, this is not a full GNR concert. Conclusion, If download any live concert, burn it to dvd, probably you will obtain a better dvd quality than this dvd"
2,mega-crap,"I bought this DVD and is awful! No big deal. Horrible video quality, seems it was recorded with a handy-cam and you even could see the signing from ""HIFI"" to ""NORM"" and viceversa on the screen. No audience interactivity, darken images.I'm not sure if this recording was responsibility of the band or even authorized by the band, due to it has a cheating cover! At least two mistakes: Front cover photo, showed the original line-up of the band, but the concert was from 1992 whith Steven and Izzy replacements done. The line-up and Band Logo on the cover are not contemporaneous. Advise: Save your money."
5,Good times,"I first saw this film the night it premiered on Disney channel back in October of 1999. I remember the night like it was yesterday, and over the years this film has garnered some sentimental value, and holds its place among other Disney Channel Halloween classics such as `Don't Look Under the Bed' and `Halloweentown'.My only issue is with Disney. Why, Disney, do you refuse to release this movie on DVD? The VHS tapes are becoming harder and harder to find, meanwhile the prices for them are going up while quality deteriorates.It seems as if more than a few people tune in to this movie every October when it is aired; in return this should show Disney that there is at least minimal interest in the movie, at least enough to keep in on October rotation.Hopefully at some point `Can of Worms' (and `Don't Look Under the Bed' at that) will receive a proper DVD releases."
5,Can of Worms,Mike opened his can of worms and they poured out all over the tennis courts!i hate it when they do that with chodes! theres no time to be a teenager when your stuck in a broom closet with mike and his can of worms! RAMMING SPEED!
5,Where has this guy been my whole life?,Great power pop record in the vein of classic Cheap Trick.Full of hooks and catchy melodies.Highly recommended.Another great one taken from us way too soon.
4,Buy this now.,"I'm shocked to see this as a CD. This is a pretty good album that sort of went under the radar back in the 80's. Phil was part of the Dwight Twilley Band, then went solo. He died of cancer a while back. They should have rereleased the Phil Seymour and Phil Seymour 2 albums as one CD. If you like this album, buy it before it disappears and becomes one of those $50 used CDs."
3,Wireless does not work,There is no timer on the wireless piece and the wireless function only works from several feet away from the base.
2,beware of the cord,"For those of you who are looking for a wireless thermometer, this is a fine unit but has some issues... the largest is in my opinion is the probe and cord. I bought my first one a couple years ago, loved it but then it started reading 159 degrees when it should be just room temp. Well the problem was the probe I was told, and the probe is not covered by the warranty. Evidently any bend in the wire can ruin it. They also mentioned that any water on it would ruin it..... how can we wash it then???? I couldn't find a replacement probe so I got another one, and it lasted two weeks. Again they would not cover it under warranty. Buyer beware."
3,a challenge to learn,"I bought this over a month ago and haven't yet made time to learn to use it. It's kind of like programming a VCR. I was a professional programmer so it has nothing to do with ability, it's time and motivation. This gadget actually got turned on in the drawer and it wasn't even quickly evident how to get it shut off. I presume that I'll eventually make the effort but at the moment I wish I'd bought something simple."
2,Poor DVD,"First do not be confused : This DVD is a documentary, not a show !Second : It last 28 minutes, and this is about thier tour in CaliforniaThird : There is only one song on this DVD which is Viens DanserFourth : I hope you understand French well (I Do...)I hope this review will be useful (as a warning !)"
1,Decent attempt....but with a major problem.,"Focusing primarily on the rarely-seen Fleischer/Famous Superman shorts from World War II (which, like most of the war cartoons produced under the Paramount banner, features the Japanese), this disc has about the best video possible for a public domain release of these classic cartoons. Problem is, this company has arrogantly decided to add their own sound effects in addition to (and sometimes over) the original soundtrack. What could be a reasonably affordable holdover until Warner Bros. restores the cartoons turns into a colossal waste because of the audio equivalent of graffiti. Additionally, the beginning of the final cartoon, ""Terror on the Midway"" is nothing more than a series of freeze frames, implying that the publisher didn't look too hard for a decent print. Definitely not worth buying."
3,Not the best audio in the world,"Well, I have the ""sequel DVD"" to vs. Nature & War, Superman vs. Monsters & Villains. Now, I will admit the picture quality is quite a bit better than some I have seen, however, it could get a bit sharper. Also, from the first short I watched I was not pleased with the sound. For one, the mono soundtrack can be improved, and second, I don't like things added to the original. In a sense, it takes away from the vintage material and is not the same. Also at times, the mono soundtrack volume level is very low. If you're looking for the original, I don't suggest this too much. However, if you just want something to add to your collection or something for the kids to watch, this is not bad."
4,"good reproduction, but poor sound quality","i bought both Superman vs. Monsters and Villans and Superman vs. Nature and War. not bad, and they are a slice of Americana, but the sound isn't very good.the sound in the Batman cartoons remind me of high school, watching those movies in class on a reel. the cartoons are excellent, but again, sound is pretty shaky.Look! in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, it's SUPERMAN!"
4,This is a classic,"If you have a scroll saw you will love this book. The patterns are simple to follow and the puzzles easy to create out of scrap wood. It will keep your friends, children, and grandchildren happily busy for hours figuring out the solutions."
5,Lovely Devotional Poems,"These are some beautiful poems that show the true Christian spirit -- you can really tell that the Holy Spirit moved the author to pen some of these little jewels. My favourite's were ""A Mother's Love"" and ""Lady,"" althouth ""The Lighhouse"" was also a very inspirational poem. I hope to see more from this author soon!"
1,"1 star for the ripoff, 5 stars for the series","The American release of X (a great series from what I've seen so far) is a complete and utter ripoff. I bought the entire series (bilingual) for only $30, less than the price of this first American DVD. I found a seller on ebay who shipped it to me from Hong Kong and I am very happy with the product (all 26 episodes on 3 DVDs). If you would rather pay 8 times as much for this series, be my guest. But I recommend you get the import."
3,A warning about this first DVD for those new to the series,"A few people have referred to this, but I thought I'd be a bit more explicit, as it isn't mentioned anywhere on the DVD packaging and some people, like me, may be a bit annoyed to find it out too late: Episode 0 is a ""prequel"" episode that was made after the rest of the series; it contains massive spoilers about characters and events.DO NOT WATCH EPISODE 0 FIRST IF YOU INTEND TO CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE SERIES.If you're just checking the series out to see if you're interested and/or don't mind being spoiled, by all means go ahead and watch it (it's a good episode)... but I thought it was highly irritating that such a thing appeared first on the DVD without any kind of warning to viewers."
2,Epic But Empty,"This series suffers from the same limitations as plagues most anime: visually arresting with an epic yet shallow narrative, reflecting its manga roots, and ultimately as juvenile in plot and character development as the audience for which it was intended. For the entertainment of tweens and teens only."
4,logitick quick cam,The cameria its self was good. The mic that cam with it. Its not good. Have hard time working
1,Poor picture,This camera produces a poor image that is grainy and has color problems even in decent light. The picture is much worse than images from the Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks in the same light. I am returning my Quickcam Chat but keeping the Quickcam for Notebooks.
2,uhmmmmmmmm okay wouldn't buy another one,This was one of the worst cams I have ever purchased since learned my lesson going to save up for one of those digital handheld camcorders instead with better resolution and megapixels. This was aweful the picture was grainy horrible experience wouldn't buy another. I use them mostly to do my expotv product reviews this wasn't working for what I wanted it for. So I am saving up to someday get a aiptek digital handheld camcorder or one of those flip ones instead. this is okay maybe for yahoo messenger if that .I definitly like my Creative Live one better. My other logitech which was the quick cam im messenger or something the gray one my boyfriend gave me worked alot better had better resolution this one wouldn't recommend it get what you pay for kind of a thing .
1,Garbage,I just bought it and checked it out. It is horrible. Apparently there is no such thing as a free lunch. It's cheap for a reason. The picture is grainier than the videos of bigfoot.
4,Decent and only payed 5 dollars total for everything,"I ordered this webcam the 12th ( it was a weekend ) it didnt ship till the 16th which i figured was cause i ordered on a weekend and vday , today is the feb 17th , and i got it within one day of shipping , the quality on it is actually pretty good only thing that is wrong with me it has like a a second or half of a second laag it seems, but its not a big deal, i payed $4.99 and free shipping for my webcam so i didnt expect it to b this good ,"
2,A good basic web cam,If you want a really clear picture..don't buy this. But if you want a basic web cam and just are using it once in awhile..go with it. Otherwise..buy something more updated.
2,Don't waste your money,This camera was a very contraversial one. I bought 2 cameras (one for me and the other for my boyfriend) and my camera and mic worked perfectly fine....but my boyfriend's didn't. His camera had a terriable quality (I could barely see his face it was so blurry!) and his mic didn't work at all. I suggest you save your money and buy a better webcam.
3,Okay,"It's not terrible, it's not great, it's a cheap little webcam. If you want something powerful, you're going to pay more money. It's that simple. I bought this at walmart and it does what I need. Not recommended for professional quality purposes."
2,Just awful,"I would do a video review, except the microphone that comes with the damned thing doesn't work! Compound tht with the fact it has super low resolution and is ghosts horribly and this camera just isn't worth your time. The only thing preventing me from rating this one star is the ridiculously quick and easy installation."
4,Nice cheap webcam for a linux user,"As a linux user, I've all too often run into poor hardware support from vendors who only know of or support ms windows, so it was with some trepidation that I recently looked for a reasonably priced webcam. When I saw the logitech quickcam chat, I figured it was hard to go too far wrong for the price, but as it turns out, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works fairly nicely, and it was surprisingly little fuss to set up.I merely followed the instructions in the suse webcam wiki at http://en.opensuse.org/HCL/Web_Cameras and I was up and running in a few minutes, chatting with kopete on a yahoo connection to a friend in another state.I rate it at 4 stars only because the quality of the images is not as good as it could be - but for a cheap webcam it's perfectly acceptable."
1,Total waste of money,"Guess those who say the webcam is good are first timers!!! this webcam is just too blurry and get worse under low lighting conditions.. the item says its 640 X 480 pixels.... thats wrong the best is 320 X 240!!! Even that is not clear the grainy image is enough to spoil your day.. one of the worst logitech products.. don't even know why its sold in the it stores.. this should be contraband from the IT world, real big flop...real big flop its lesss than 1/5............."
4,cheap camera,"I looked for the cheapest thing on the market, and it works just as great as any of the 100 cameras. Good product!"
1,Waste,"Don't waste your money on this outdated camera. Yes, you are visible with this camera but the quality is so poor, grainy and blurry, it made the whole experience quite disappointing. Spend a little more for a better product."
4,Webcam,"I already have 2 webcam of Logitech....i bot this one for my friend.....have used this product for past couple of months.....its really great......good deal, reasonable price........branded company....you cant expect much for this price......if u r not brand oriented then u cud look out for something else....but brand n reasonable price compared to others....this is the deal u shud be looking for....."
1,pay a little more for something better,"I bought this webcam, tried it once...and packed it neatly back in the box for return! It has good light- thats about it for me. The quality is very fuzzy, and the speed is far from quick...its more like still images moving slowly. I was not happy with this product and surprised because it's made by Logitech. I strongly suggest trying another Logitech webcam not this one."
1,Worst Camera ever!!!!!!!!!,"This camera is a waste of money. I got it because it says directly on the box that it works with Windows live messanger (dont know), AIM( cant find webcam setup), and Yahoo messanger.....WRONG! I got this webcam to chat with my brother on yahoo meassanger and it wont even connect with yahoo, i tryed the help that Yahoo suggested and nothing! Dont bother wasting your time on this even if you just want to make videos with it because unless you get perfect lighting the video is grainy as hell and often eather way too dark or way blown out!!! Crap crap crap....Im dead serious this is a waste of money!!!!"
1,"disappointed, totally.....","I bought this webcam about 7months ago..but rarely used it..initially it was working fine, but I don't know what happened,i din't even drop it or mishandle it..The picture quality is horrible..I don't even bother using it anymore...I paid $27 for this piece of junk...total waste of money.."
2,"Chep camera for chat, poor quality.","The title says it all. If you want a cheap camera for video chat, then this is a camera and it's cheap. But the quality is not very good at all. Also does not pick up well at night in a lit room - I often resorted to getting a desk lamp next to me.I got this cam to work on Mac OS X."
2,you get what you pay for,"As with most things, this webcam proved to be worth what I payed for it, which was not very much. It is decent for using with a messenger, just to talk to someone with, but I would never rely on it as a camera for photos. It's an OK webcam, nothing special, but it works."
3,Not that great,"I should do a video review using the cam, but you'd not be able to see me very well. This is not worth the money. Spend the extra and get the next step up. I bought this to chat with my daughter and some friends. It is grainy, and VERY slow... i look like I am moving in slow motion ALL the time. My daughter's webcam is fantastic! It is super clear and like watching TV. No lag time or anything. The webcam was easy to install, no issues with Skype (which is what I bought it for), and it works fine on my laptop. Bright light, such as sunlight, in front of you helps with clarity a bit. There is not any microphone, but does come with a mini headset of sorts. It has an earbud with a mic on the cord. I've not tried that as my laptop has a microphone. If you have the extra to spend, get the Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000. If not, and you are like me, this one will do the job, but don't expect it to be that great."
2,slightly spooky?,"Slightly Spooky?I dont' think so. The stories had some weirdendings, middles, AND beginnings. ... This book has""suspense"", the best ""suspense"" I was able to detect was whe thecharacters were walking!Not much of a story, I don't really recommend it. But if you would like to read to easily scared kids, go ahead and purchase it."
2,Don't make them like they used to,Materials used to produce these toys not tough at all. Seam on back split after one day--same toy from 5-6 years ago still going strong (minus whiskers and eyes). Would not recommend today's version!!
3,Too much for Too Little,This is a very small toy. I paid 8.99 for it and I feel it should be more like 3 dollars since it is so small. The puppy likes to play with it but she will outgrow very soon since it is sooo small.
4,Nice,"It's nice to be able to hear these songs again. My vinyl copies of their albums are at this point only marginally listenable. This has most of the best but as with all compillation albums there is going to be a few omissions & everybody has their own opinions as to what constitutes ""best"". For me, I'm just happy to have it. Bring to mide those days of incesne & acid. As good as their records were, where they really shined was live. My favorite performance was at the Sacramento Pop Festival October 1967, on the bill with Captain Beefheart, Spirit, Strawberry Alam Clock, Nitty Gritty dirt Band, Hour Glass, New Breed, Hamilton Streetcar & the Jefferson Airplane who they blew off the stage."
3,good,"This contains tracks from the first two Sunshine Company albums, the second being the slightly better. Parts are more rock oritented than the first.Still, this band went to far into out and out soft pop, which is a shame because they are pretty good when in the middle of the road. But neither of these albums have the zip of the Association or the jazz talent of Free Design.It beats a Letterman album, but that is not is not saying much."
4,Not Light Reading,"Purchased as a textbook for my Architectural Theory class. While very in-depth and expansive, Trachtenberg postulates opinions as fact, without a second opinion.Being a textbook, everything said is drawn out and convoluted. This has the potential to either leave the reader with a deep understanding or completely bewildered.Being an architecture student, this book is giving me a historical design base I plan to build off of for the rest of my life."
4,Architecture: From Prehistory to Postmodernity,"This book summarizes over ten thousand years of architectural history in such a practical and clear form. Ignoring its price, I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in architecture. However, though the book briefly studies such vast expanses in the history of architecture, it fails to even touch architecture in the eastern world. Asia still continues to remain much of a mystery and covering it would truly enlighten the human imagination. Yet, doing so would also probably double the size of the book, thus increasing its cost to over a hundred American dollars. The book also, I feel, seems to enter into too much detail in the forms of modern architecture. In buying this book, one most likely seeks to learn more of history not 'postmodernity,' nevertheless it can be interesting to learn how modern architecture has come to pass."
3,The author has his thumb on the scale,"Bolles writes as if Einstein (along with Schrödinger) were the only physicists concerned with REALITY, and as if Bohr and his school (Heisenberg, Kramers, Sommerfeld, et alii) were focused only on the pragmatics of finding rules that fit the data points.This is unfair to Bohr: Bohr was forced to take his positions by the fact that nothing more ""realistic"" could be found. Whatever he was searching for, Einstein found nothing better. Bolles writes as though the quantum theory was determined by the force of wills and character of the two principals involved. This is just not true."
4,4.5 Stars,Have had them for over 3 years and still holding up & protecting my wrist from injury when doing dips and other exercises with free weights.
3,They do the job,"These wrist wraps work fairly well, and I have been using them for about a year now. My only complaint however is that the Velcro is deteriorating, there is almost none left. If they didn't skimp on the cheapest Velcro on the market I would have given them a 5"
4,GREAT DANCING TRACKS!!,"This lady can sing!! And she is a great actress too!! I love all her movies - ""Viva las Vegas"" with Elvis (some of the best go-go dancing!!)and ""Carnal Knowledge"" (Best Supporting Actress nomination - she should have won the Oscar for her dramatic role)with Jack Nicholson are some of her best!!"
1,More Disco Please?,Not up to the calibre of her previous music. This stuff is like a makeover at 50 trying to look 20. Not worth her trip to the studio.
1,1 star for the Connor/Liz drama,"OK! Enough is enough! It has been 10 books now that the Connor/Liz saga keeps dragging on. Either get them together or let them both move on with it. I'm SO sick of this crap with Liz moping around, acting like she doesn't have a life, and Connor wanting her but acting like he doesn't. COME ON AUTHOR, QUIT DRAGGING THIS STORY LINE ON!"
5,Okay,"In broken angel, Tia and Angel deal with his money loss. Jermey and Jessica back off because Jermey cand see Jess has feelings for Will. Elizabeth is still moping around about Conner. Conner is having troble with his mom and you can tell he still has feelings for Liz. Ken and Maria are getting closer and Andy is sill stuck in the middle of everyones problems."
4,Kinda Deppressing,"Well, that part at the beggining with Angel and Tia just sorta drags on. It's like Tia keeps hearing the same thing over and over, and over and over, she freaks out. My friend said in about April that she really didn't like Jessica and that Elizabeth was the better of the two. While I was reading this book and I was looking at one of Elizabeth's journal entries, I realiized that she obsesses too much. And I think Andy should hook up with Elizabeth, or somehting. The guy seems kinda funny and he never seems to get a break. I wait every month for the next book in the series, but my bookstore is extemely slow. I got so frustrated looking at the excerpts for Broken Angel that I went to another city about 200 miles away and bought it there."
4,Not bad,"It's card games, but you have to know how to play them before you try to play them on this one. The instuctions leave a lot to be desired but overall not a bad game."
5,Great collection!,"I like the game very much. It all comes together.Sure, Hold'em would have been a fit but Poker is more fun with real money anyways. I was not looking to play casino games but the classics. Videopoker is excellent for ""training"" before going to Vegas.All games are very customizable to your favourite rules-set. When the previous reviewer states that he plays Spades without the Joker (Benny), then just switch the Rules-set... Even more options are available there. Go to the Options >> Rules in the during Pause. It's simple. You can even change the Scoring if you like to.Overall I can suggest the game to everybody with a Game Boy. It will have unlimited playing time and you might keep your GBA just for this game. I have never seen a game with higher value."
5,I Love This Game,"I ordered Ultimate Card Games because I enjoy playing solitaire but I have not played even one of the many solitaire games because I absolutely cannot stop playing Spades. I'm sure the others, such as canasta, hearts, many different solitaire games, gin rummy, poker, blackjack, are just as addicting but I cannot stop playing Spades! Thanks, Amazon, for having this new video game in stock since no one in my town including Toys R Us or Wally World seems to even know about it."
2,Don't buy it for the Solitaire,"I am a huge solitaire fan and I bought this just for Klondike. The game only lets you go through the deck twice and then you LOSE! WHAT is this!!! Instead of letting you select different cards/backgrounds/music it should have given you more options for your actual game! After wasting thirty bucks on this I gave it to my sister and went back to my old gameboy two color cartridge.Also, it seems like they could have made the cards a little bigger and had less background. Have the makers seen the latest reasearch on the number of adults playing video games? Also that the adults preferred games are card and puzzle games? You guys need to MAXIMIZE the size for aging eyes!P.S. I am 46 and have my own Gameboy Advance SP and love it!"
1,Bugs Bugs Bugs - Ultimate Disappointment,"The only ""ultimate"" was my ultimate disappointment. This game cartridge could have been so much better. The bugs are so annoying in some of the games that I can't play them any longer because they are so frustrating. (Think having Ace, Two and Three of clubs in Gin Rummy and having the computer decide that this is deadwood instead of a run).Some of the games have so many people playing that it is no fun for children (moves too fast). It would have been nice if you could choose how many opponents for Crazy Eights or Go Fish."
1,Where is it ?,"Has anyone received this product yet ?? I placed an order back in february. I'm getting alot of conflicting information. My account states that this item should ship last march. I got a letter from amazon, last april, stating that the release of the product is being pushed back to May 18th. This website (Amazon.com) states that the game is available and should ship in 2-3 days and I can't get a striaght answer from amazon customer no service. Does anyone know what's going on ? Maybe I can get the game faster if I cancel the order and re-order."
4,Crushing Disappointment,"I waited months for this release like many others, only to be incredibly disappointed. I wanted the Solitaire games most of all, and was hoping they would play the same as Microsoft's versions that are included in their Windows operating systems packages. I didn't get that. Klondike, FreeCell and Spider (called Spiderette in Ultimate Care Games) all play differently than the MS versions and cannot be customized. I guess I must continue to wait for someone to release the sort of Gameboy Advance solitaire package that I have in my dreams. This is not it."
4,What's the holdup?,"The release date of this game continues to get extended. Now it is held up until March 2004 and I've been watching for this since about October 2003. What's wrong? This is the first game title to spark my interest in a long time. We haven't seen a good hand-held card game collection since the Solitaire games for Game Boy (which was not in color, either, so you couldn't tell the card suits apart)."
5,Hours of Entertainment!,This game has tons of card & casino games. I am 47 & use it on my son's Gameboy when we travel or go camping. It is great for all ages!
3,"OK, good value for your dollar.","This game is pretty good, though not espcially robust. It has a lot of games, which is nice for variety. But it doesn't have Texas Hold Em poker, which I was hoping for. Some of the games require a lot of clicks to keep the game moving forward. All in all though its a pretty good game for the price since you get a lot choices."
1,AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Like my subject... AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!I have been waiting for this stupid game for sooooo long!!! It was supposed to come out so late, then it was pushed to February, then it was pushed to March 31, now it is pushed to MAY?! Aaaaahhhhh!!!!! I recently read their review on Gameboy.IGN.com and I thought, I am sooo happy I waited long enough to get this game. I saw their release date and it says March 31... May 12... I may as well just cancel this and order something else...Pros:Very good for long drivesCons:Too long to wait...(it's just like GTA 3 for GBA...)"
3,It's ok...,I got these lacing cards for my kids to keep them occupied in the car or at church. They were interested for the first day or so but after that they have more fun hanging them from things rather than lacing them.
5,A perfect round,"This collection of semi-autobiographical stories shows Fraser at his best, freed from the need to construct fiction around his Flashman character and hence allowed to bring on a rich cast of well-remembered characters from his youth. The camaraderie of an Army regiment is beautifully drawn, as are the tensions which exist inside any closely-knit group of people.But the stories dominate this book, from the tense inter-regimental quiz to the chaotic attempts to prevent a smallpox outbreak and the tour-de-force in which all of the main characters find themselves involved in a golf match, the tension increased by the smallness of the stakes for which they are playing.All the characters, from mystical-thinking padres from the Western Isles, to Glaswegian ruffians and Sandhurst-trained exquisites, play their part in one of the most enjoyable and amusing collections of short stories it is possible to imagine."
4,Like Them,"For the price of what the ""Quick Lubes"" want for a basic blade there is no comparison.Super EZ to install, great looks and clearing performance.If the winter performance and life cycle turn out to be good, they will get the last star and be the replacement wipers for all my cars."
3,"Good Wiper, but locking clip keeps popping open","The wiper is great at wiping the windscreen. I have bought wipers for both my cars. Unfortunately on one of the cars, the locking clip does not engage correctly and keeps flipping open. The blade stays attached, but is distracting while driving."
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE !!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I just installed a pair of Valeos last night (12 feb 08) for an impending snowstorm, and when I got out the snow this morning, these things chattered and squealed like crazy! I didn't get one clean swipe at all. And worse, the ice on my windshield started to build up right in the center of the wiper - and my direct line of vision - absolutely blinding me!I've been driving in the Canadian winters for the past 32 years, and I have NEVER had a worse product on my vehicles!!! I paid $35 for the pair, and it was my biggest waste of money EVER! Utter GARBAGE! And even though they froze, my summer blades did a better job cleaning my windshield!"
1,Broke after a month,"After about a month of slight use, the center portion of the wiper blade dislodged itself. Now there is a section in the middle that doesn't clean the windshield. Even before it broke, they were still pretty horrible wipers. There is nothing ""Ultimate"" about these wipers; stick with the Bosch."
1,"Worst wiper, just lasted for 2 weeks, flew off the vehicle in light rain","I will tell you, this is the worst wiper I have bought, it just flew off the vehicle when I was driving @40mph in light rain. The little plastic which holds the wiper was broken. You can imagine after the wiper flew off, I had to drive back in that rain by really struggling to see what is in front of me. Please don't buy this as it is a serious security issue when driving in rain. It just happened to me and I wanted to let everyone know this as I understood how difficult it is to drive if your wiper is broken, when you are 30miles away from your home and when the rain is never stopping."
5,Works awesome!!!!,"Valeo Wiper Blades are the best they are working perfect, and keep my windshiled very clear from rain and snow. I was very surprised on how easy it was to install anyone can do it. I recommend this yo everyone you will not be disappointed."
1,Look elsewhere,"I purchased the 24"" and 18"" Valeo Ultimates from Amazon about 3 weeks ago. They worked fine at the beginning but now they are useless. The rubber sticks onto the windshield creating lines across the glass. Not only do the lines block your sight, they get the actual blade stuck and it flings to the end of the windshield! All I here is SQUEAK-BANG-SQUEAK-BANG... the under portion of the blade vibrates and squeaks across the glass.I decided to try to contact Valeo but it seems that they don't have customer service. I've called multiple times and it tells me that there is no one available to answer the phone. It then goes on to tell all the places you can purchase the wiper blades (just what I want!). Finally it says you can leave a message.If you expect any support, warranty coverage, or a reliable product, look elsewhere."
1,Good! for about a month,"I bought these for my car, and they worked great for about one month. After that they were terrible, not wiping well at all, just smearing water all over the place.Installation was easy enough, and initially I thought they were good.My old stock $5 toyota wiper insert replacements worked MUCH better and cost less.I was so disappointed in these wiper blades that I'll never use them again.I had to tear these out in the rain and put back my toyota blades at the gas station so I could see!"
2,"Inovative design, poor performance","The blades look great, worked good for about a month and then started to streak along the window after a month of use. I would not recommend these."
1,Wrost wiper ever,"Length:: 0:31 MinsBought after watching their ad video and these as there was some sale.I will say they spent good money on the ad video but definitely not on the product research. See the video and the image I uploaded, the wiper doesn't clear all the water and on top of that makes annoying noiseThis product doesn't even deserve the 1 star."
2,Bad fit for my car. Also started streaking within weeks,I used the manufacturer's website to obtain the model for my 1997 rav4.The passenger side blade did not fit properly (does it provide full contact with the mirror near the blade end).The blades (both driver and passenger side) also began streaking within weeks of usage.
5,the best on the market,"i have had the bosch icon, they must have improved it because its horrible. valeo is the best, clear and no streaks, buy it"
3,Quality normal.,This thing had a great clean effect at the beginning but not lasted very long. Now it doesn't work well and makes the windshield not very clean.
2,curve,"some people say its ugly, i actually think this is a nice look compared to my old wipers that were the same style as oem (i have a honda cg2) but the downside of this product is that it curves and does not match my windshields natural curvature therefore at the end of the wiper it doesn't have good contact with the windshield"
1,Interesting Blade - - Clear Manufacturing Defect,"Ordered two blades (1 26"", 1 19""). The 19"" blade had a clear manufacturing defect.Based on the low price of the product, I will not waste the time returning.If you are looking for wiper blades, look elsewhere - - or buy them somewhere they are easy to return!"
5,Great Wiper...better than my other,"Got this to replace some cheap-o ones from costco, this is so much better, but we shall see how long it lasts, so far so good, but its only been two months. Installation is quick and easy...the longest part was taking the old blades off, but it fit on my 2006 4runner perfectly. Will buy again when this wears out."
2,Too much money for poor engineering,"I went out on a limb and purchased these wiper blades at a premium. It took less than a month before the blade itself slipped out of the metal guide. While the blade can be positioned back into the guide and works great when functional, every week or (2) I have to fix the same issue. I have used this new style wiper from other brands, and this is the only one that has given me this issue."
3,"Good wiping performance, so so durability","Wiping performance was great even after more than a season on the car, a Mazda Protege. Your mileage may vary of course. Winter crud still builds up on the wiper in heavier snows. I had to replace these because the plastic clips used to hold wiper to typical hook end arms broke because they have an extremely thin section where the clip holds the wiper."
4,Valeo Wipers,So far so good. I've had them on for about 5 months and hasn't given me any problems thus far. Still wiping smoothly. Only giving a four for now since it hasn't been even half a year or gone through a winter. Hopefully it does!
3,Poor choice for sub zero weather,"These wipers work great at temps of 20 degrees F or warmer and have very quiet operation. When it gets colder than that however, they freeze solid, and make a horrible sound when trying to use them (think nails on a chalkboard). They also don't clean effectively at this cold of weather. I put these on my wife's car this past summer, and some cheap Ancos on mine, and the Ancos are fine for the winter, where these are not. Also, the plastic cover on one of them shattered in the cold. Would not buy again."
2,Smear-me's,Thought these were going to be great wipers reading the descriptions and reviews. I have a 2009 Dodge Journey. They seemed to be fine at first but now they're leaving a smear streak at eye level. I tried cleaning them and pushing down on the wiper arm to get a tight attachment to the window. That works for a little while but it soon returns to streaking. They do still freeze up in icy conditions. Can't say they're any better than any other wiper.
3,They work for the most part but not quite,"For the most part they work. However the blades fail to ""bend"" in areas where the windshield curvature is highest. The end result is that these areas do not get cleared by the wiper blades. The most significant areas are the lower passenger side of the windshield & the upper left corner of the driver side windshield. My original Toyota wipers worked fine there. On the upside they did eliminate the chatter problem of my original set as they had gotten too old (the old set was fine when new). Anyway I am OK with these for now but at some point I'll be switching back to something similar to what I had before."
5,The Ultimate Wiper Blades,I am 60 years old and these are the best by far wiper blades I have ever used...Buy em you'll like em
3,Not impressed,"I expected a lot from these fancy blades. The instal on my Audi A6 was super easy, just a snap in, very impressed, but that about it. Visibility is pretty much the same, not much advantage, except when parked they are invisible.It took two months to work them in ( for them to take the windshield shape). Boy! I was upset, but it's better now. Still, the performance is not that great for premium pricing, leaves streaks on the edges. The claimed aerodynamics effects are dismal (and I have PhD in this area). One winter in Michigan was OK, cleaning blades from snow and sleet was easy.From reading reviews here, I think the performance depends on particular vehicle so you can risk it."
2,VALEO WIPER BLADES,"I PUT THE WIPER BLADES ON MY 2002 CHEVY SILVERADO WORKS GREAT IN THE RAIN, THERE IS A CLEAN WIPE. NOT USED YET WITH FROST, SNOW, OR ICE ON WINDSHIELD. THE PART THAT IS NOT GREAT IS THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER DOES NOT CONTOUR TO THE WINDSHIELD, LEAVING 3 INCHES AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT AND NARROWING DOWN TO 1 INCH AT THE TOP OF WINDSHIELD THAT IT DOES NOT EVEN TOUCH. I SWITCHED THE WIPERS BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE. THESE ARE EXPENSIVE WIPERS, BUT AMAZON HAD THE BEST PRICE. YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD FIT PERFECT OR THE MANUFACTURE WOULD SAY NOT FOR THIS MODEL TRUCK. THANKS AMAZON FOR YUOR GREAT PRICES, FREE SHIPPING ON MUST ITEMS, AND NO TAX UNTIL I BELIEVE 2015 WHEN YOU WILL HAVE TO START CHARGING TAX HERE IN TN."
2,Wiper blade is nothing special,"So I decided to pick these up as they were 50% off and to a normal price. I have had them for several month and they are nothing special. No difference from my old one that from these. Unless they are 50% off, do not pick them up."
5,Ten Stars would be enough,Bought these for my 02 Explorer that had wiper problems since I bought it new. All cars should coming with these...my 06 Caddy did. Wipe clean even in freezing weather and snow. You will not be disappointed.
5,flawless!!!,"I bought these for my Tacoma and after one week of rain, I knew I had to get them for my wifes Jeep asap. A must for wiper blades!"
5,Truly the ultimate wiper blade!,"These are the best wipers I've ever owned. Easy to install, ultra quiet and leaves a beautiful clear wipe. (These were installed in a few minutes with the American male method, i.e. if there extra parts left when you are done or if you simply cannot make it work read the instructions. Well..didn't read the instructions (only one part) and they installed on first try.)"
2,Decent performers but terrible sizing!,"My vehicle takes a 24"" blade on the driver's side. The factory blade was 24.5"" long. The Rain-X Latitude I replaced it with last year was marked as 24"" and was actually 23.75"" long. I chose this blade for its good reviews and it does so far perform well but even though it was sealed in a 24"" marked box, the actual blade is only 22.5"" long, which leaves a large, unwiped wedge between the two blades. So be warned, and check your sizing. I could've gotten the 26"" model and it would probably have been a better fit if they're all sized short."
4,Valeo wiper blades,"I bought these to see if they outperformed the Rain-X Latitude wiper blades. So far, they seem comparable, but wouldn't really say they are better than the Rain-X Latitude blades. I recommend never going cheap on wiper blades. Get these or Rain-x Latitude. You won't regret it."
1,Poorly Engineered,"Apparently the engineering team that designed these ""ultra high tech"" blades was not the same one that designed the 5 cent plastic part that holds the blades to the wiper arm, which broke while I was driving in the rain after just a couple of months. Not recommended!"
2,"They are just ok, NOT WORTH THE MONEY",They are just OK. No better than the cheaper pair I replaced them with. Save your money.They did not last long and I doubt I would purchase them again.
2,Does not live up to its hype,"Installation was easy. Performance is good. But after a few weeks, the wiper started to jump across the windshield rather than slide across smoothly, and this was in pouring rain."
2,Disappointing,"I have had bad luck with this type of wiper blade. The special curved blade does not work on my car after about a month. I saw the reviews on these wiper blades and decided to try them out. At first, I was really happy with them, until about a month later, they were leaving smears and streaks across my entire windshield. I am going to buy conventional wiper blades again. I hope those work better.Other info:My car is a 2000 honda civic LX."
5,So far so good,"I've had my share of wiper blades refills over the years to know when a product does exactly what it supposed to do. These wiper blades are by the far the finest yet. I've had Bosch Evolution, Michelin Stealth, and RainX Latitude brand blades on a Lexus 400h. None have performed as well as these. They wipe clean and with any clatter associated with the other brands. They are very effective at highway speed. In my opinion, you can't go wrong with these wiper blades. I will update as blades are used over time and age as well as their effectiveness in different weather patterns."
5,Excellent Fit & Function,"This product was beyond simple to install on my 2008 Grand Prix and performs exactly as I hoped they would. They do not leave streaks, they are nearly silent at rest or at speed. Specifically noteworthy is they handle that, ""My windshield is annoyingly moist but not quite fully wet and slick"" situation with the same consistency and quiet operation. I will add that I have treated my windshield with a common water repellant product and I am unsure what if any role that plays in the performance. All in all, very pleased with this and I would highly recommend it."
1,"Streaked from the very beginning, should have returned it.","I bought two of these wipers in different sizes. This one (the 26"" one) started doing slight streaking from the day it was installed; I cleaned it repeatedly, but the situation never improved. It passed the last state inspection, but I will not purchase this brand again."
2,LESS THAN PLEASED...,"I ordered two sets of these when Amazon had a special 2 for 1 deal. It took forever for them to arrive as the company apparently did not gear up for the sale. Although placed on the same order, the blades were shipped in two separate boxes... what a waste of paper and shipping cost! The installation went well and the product initally performed OK. There was a minor squeeking for the first few weeks until I lubed my windows with Rain-X to get rid of the noise. I'm thinking that the manufacturer did not actually make these blades to fit my Durango, yet they listed them as a proper fit. The worse part is that these blades were only able to perform for less than a season... the passenger side wiper began to unfold at the tip, causing bare metal to scratch against my windshield. I would not recommend these blades at any price."
1,Poor quality materials,"I bought two of these blades a few months ago, but did not install them untilthe middle of August. After two days and three uses the plastic broke and the wiper fell apart.I will never use this product again."
2,Extremely average at extremely overpriced,These are just ok. Nothing special. They are not worth the extra money they cost. I put these on and the old ones worked better. Save your money.
3,"good for rain, not sleet","I have to agree with the comment here about these not being great for sleet. Ice builds up under the blades, lifting the blades off the windshield, and rendering them useless."
1,Worst wiper blades I've ever owned,"Purchased both a 26"" and 16"" Valeo Ultimate All-Season for my 2007 Scion tc. What a disappointment! Installation went O.K. but the clips that hold the blade to the arm are rather flimsy and would come loose on the 26"" blade. Both blades would streak badly and leave several areas of the windshield not wiped or poorly wiped. Terrible blades. Good thing I kept my worn factory blades because they went back on! Terrible lousy blades... save your money and look elsewhere."
4,Good Wipes,"I installed the wipers on two cars, a Mazda and Dodge truck. The wipers have been installed on the car about a month and have good wiping properties. The wipers have been on the truck for a couple weeks and work will to wipe cleanly away all water. They have good pressure along the entire wiper to evenly wipe away all water and debris. Install was particularly easy and the clipping mechanism seems very robust compared to cheaper wipers."
2,Poor quality,Not much space between rubber edge and frame. May damage glass. Streak left on glass. Not what I thought it would be. Poor quality.
2,Works good but make horrible squeaking noise.,I have had these wipers for about 4 months on my Jeep Wrangler.Pros: They clean the glass and very easy to install.Cons:Big Problem: They make horrible squeaking noise when windshield is not completely covered in water. I thought that was because they were new however the problem still persists.Would not recommend.
2,Does not fit my vehicle,Although both Amazon and the Valeo website say it will fit but it will not fit a Subaru Tribeca drivers side. This is for 9mm bars (what MOST cars have) but the my car has a 12mm bar on the drivers side.
1,Garbage.,"I bought these wipers for 5 vehicles, 4/5 are broke. The clips snap off the back and the wipers come off the arm. They worked good while they lasted, but at $40/pr I would like more than 3 months out of them. I heard the bosche are better built, haven't tried them yet. But these, these are junk."
3,Great wipers but aesthetically displeasing,"These wipers work great, but so do the regular wipers. I agree with the last poster, though these are supposed to be lower profile (no steel scaffolding along the length of the rubber blades) the attachment point to the wiper arms are atrociously bulky. They are an eyesore. However, they do not stick out as far as the OEM style but since the rest of the blade is lower profile, it makes that particular hump stand out. I was able to modify it to make lower profile and it actually looks awesome. It should not take modifying the wipers to make them look better but its possible."
1,wiper blades,"The wiper will not stay attached to the wiper arm.I was supposed to get the second wiper free, but there wasn't anyway I could place the order as such so I deleted the whole order. I was surprised to receive one wiper in the mail. So I thought since I have it I will try it.So I was disappointed with the product and Amazon."
2,not ultimate,"I have 18 and 22 (900-22-1b) on my Infinity G35 2004 sedan. Valeo wipers work much worse then stock blades. The rubber does not hug the windshield and the top 2 inches of the driver (and 3 inches) on the passenger side are not cleaned at all.better off with a regular blade.pro: easy to install, low profilecon: does not work, the end of the blade vibrates on the rough terrain."
3,"Peh, who knows already... it's still brand new?","So far, not sucha-mucha. Granted, this is my first 24"" blade and only a month in use. But I'm STILL waiting for any improvement over the totally stock Hyundai blade, even with wet snow and ice! It leaves a trail behind the swivel joint upon it's final swipe when you hit the washers... you guessed it: right in your field of view. Tried these, Bosch and PIAA. I'd say the PIAA are still the best by a big margin. Yes, I tried stopping it in mid swipe overnight several times, without effect. Any suggestions welcome. Merchant was GREAT though!"
5,Good wiper blades,"These are good wiper blades - quality construction, good looks, easy to mount and quiet operation."
3,Hopeful,"When I purchased these wiper blades, I was hopeful they would be really good. Unfortunately, in my opinion, they weren't any better than some of the others I have purchased. It could be the windshield in my car is the problem. The wiper blades all seem to leave a streak on the driver side on the left of the viewing field. That being the case, next time I will purchase cheaper wiper blades."
2,Wiper blade,I bought two pairs of these for my 2 cars. They produce a good result. However after about 1 week both of my cars strangely on the same day lost 1 wiper due to breakage. The Clip down part was broken on both accasions. I had to do a quick fix with drilling and tie down zip ties. I am not certain if the interior clip where it clips onto the wiper spindle was perhaps not clipped tightly causing movement upwards and then snapping off the lock mechanism but something strange happened. I have never seen a wiper suddenly break off before. So I can't really recommend them !
5,Clear sailing,"The reason we get windshield wipers is simple: To see where we are going and to not have to think about them again.The Valeo 900, etc., does it well. It is quiet and lays snug to the glass so that it gets all the rain off the windshield without leaving streaks.And, it is easy to install and a reasonable price."
5,excelente ..... pero amazon no es el mejor....,"los limpia parabrisas son excelentes, realmente los mejores en todo aspecto, sin embargo el personal de AMAZON los envia en unas cajas que pesan una barbaridad es como usar un container for peanuts, yo como comprador recomiendo que si el envio se lo cobran por peso no compren por AMAZON"
4,American-Filipina wedding a success,"For an American marrying a Filipina, I found Ms. Neri's book to be invaluable. It kept our wedding plans organized and on schedule.Philippine weddings are different from American weddings, and are thoroughly explained.The budget-breakdown chart helped us keep our expenses reasonable. We used the guide-for-the-Reception-M.C. This made our reception fun.My then-fiancee thought we didn't need this book until after I bought it. Then, she learned that attending Philippine weddings did not prepare her to plan a Philippine wedding. We did not need the tables for entering data. After the wedding, two of my wife's friends bought the book. The book is well-written."
4,Better use plastic plates,"Break out the checkered table cloth and the ouzo. These recipes will put you in a sailor dancing, plate throwing mood. Not only Greek, but Portuguese and Turkish dishes are represented. The ones I tried were easy to follow and delicious, although they took some time to prepare. There is a nice introduction to the different taverna cuisines in the beginning, including basic recipes for some dips and munchies. My only complaint is that there are only 128 pages."
5,LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!,Wow I was pleasantly surprised with this book as well as the Squire and the Scroll. It teaches about chasity and purity and that a kiss is something special to give to your husband. Which we are planning on promoting courtship dating with our daughters and it seems to fit well with our family values. We read fairy tales all the time (NOT DISNEY) and it does bother me that they all the happy ending. So this book does well to offset that not just ANY young man is worthy of your kiss.
5,Princess & the Kiss: A Story of God's Gift of Purity,"This is my favorite book to read to my two daughter & my son, yes my son! I believe boys should hear this story as well. We have read it many times & it is a great way to start discussions about purity. We follow w/ a prayer for their future spouses. Karen does a fantastic job of creating a special stage for this special gift."
2,not quite what I expected,"I was so excited to receive this book because of the other reviews I read, but the storyline wasn't as clear as I'd hoped it would be. I love the idea of saving your first kiss, but this book didn't approach it in a way my daughters really related to it. Also, the drawings of the men that court the young princess were really a show stopper for me and my girls...she is young and the men are all old, ugly and completely undesirable--not quite what they're going to find in the real world...yes, there will be undesireable young men, but they probably won't be as blatantly obvious as the pictures made them. By the time we got to the prince, my girls didn't even think he was handsome, unfortunately. I think the idea is fantastic, but the illustrations they chose are the reason for my low rating because they really distracted from the storyline."
5,Great message for little princesses,"This is a beautiful and very gentle introduction to the idea of purity for little girls. Some of it may be over the heads of very little girls, but 5 and up should get some real value out of it, and it is the kind of story that will stay interesting and relevant as they grow older, eventually becoming a good starting point for more indepth discussion when the time is right- only you as the parent know when that is for your particular child. ALso check out the squire and the scroll which is directed more toward boys."
5,Princess & the Kiss: A Story of God's Gift of Purity,"As our daughters struggle with dating in a modern world, I wish we had read this book with them when they were little. Together we read and discussed ""I Kissed Dating Goodbye"", but by then the world had already begun to impress it's views. Yes, they're bodies will be pure before marriage, but what of their hearts? They've started to callous because they've been broken once already. This book illustrates to the reader that a ""first kiss"" is a precious gift worthy only of a true prince. The ""first kiss"" is a fresh approach to God's gift of purity. This is a must have second book (Scripture 1st) for your daughter's library. Order several and give them to your daughter's friends."
3,"good theme, but the message is not clear","I got this for my granddaughters, hoping to offer them insight into realizing how special their love is. However all the princes that had the worldly values were ugly and rude. No one would marry them anyway. Of course the prince with the wholesome values was handsome and kind. NOT REALISTIC! The potential is there but the pictures get in the way of the message."
5,"5 stars for ""Princess & the Kiss""","""Princess and the Kiss"" is a longer picture book with beautiful illustrations and a sweet story to teach the importance of purity. I highly reccomend it."
5,Wonderful story,"My girls, 4 and 10 love this book. I like that it takes a some what difficult subject and makes it so easy to understand. I would recomend this book to anyone who may have a little girl in their life."
